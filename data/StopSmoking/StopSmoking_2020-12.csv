I went on a camping trip in September 2019 with an old friend, J. We met one new friend, B. New friend B smoked too - we were both relapsing, actually, and both of us were excited to have a partner in crime. Good old J had quit a couple years back.  B and I left the fireplace lodge scene to stand outside in the cold, puffing away, and J popped out for a sec to say hi. 

Looking at her, I was seized with envy. She just... was quit?? She just... didn't smoke? And was enjoying being a nonsmoker too? Doing all kinds of majestic athletic pursuits, to boot? I had a vision that night of my self years in the future. The self who had quit -- who was HAPPY to have quit. I was deeply, full-bodily jealous of my future self.

So if I ever get tempted, I'm going to just think of that night -- knowing that old me, who HAD to smoke? She is jealous AF of new me right now.

I started smoking at 13 and quit cold turkey at 34 on August 8th after reading the Allan Carr Easyway book and couldn't recommend that more - it really helped to break down the last few dangling threads of the addiction and see them for what they were. From what I've observed in successful attempts vs. my past failures (which felt temporary compared to this one), it seems to come down to reframing smoking for what it is psychologically and stripping away all of the little excuses you give yourself to keep going.

Whether it's someone who's older than you who smokes who seems fine, or you think that if you stop smoking you'll be no fun to be around, or lose your creativity - whatever it is, you really can get to a place where you start to know inherently that it's the addiction making those cases for you and it's highly irrational.

I also found it really helpful focusing my quit around the idea that this pandemic makes this a really stressful time to quit and therefore I don't need to be scared of future stressful situations and slipping back into it then. That helped me to see it as a final decision and made it seem like smoking again now - even one - would be stupid after all this time and I can enjoy the time I've saved from either smoking, or conspiring to smoke (which you soon realise was occupying wayyyyy more of your brain than you thought).

Anyway, I really hope this catches one person with similar relationship with smoking and helps. Good luck to everyone reading this.",7

Not only do I not have cravings anymore I‚Äôve completely passed the event horizon of even remembering what it was like to smoke in the first place.. I feel like I have never been a smoker before. Amazing, huh? The goal we all aim for. But reading this group and seeing some of the comments you wouldn‚Äôt think being in this position was possible. I‚Äôve spent the last hour looking through previous posts and it‚Äôs kind of shocking (or maybe not) how many people are saying things like ‚Äòyou‚Äôll get cravings for the rest of your life!‚Äô ‚ÄòYou‚Äôll always be a slave to cigarettes - it just gets easier‚Äô

Let me put this in the politest of terms: for the majority of people that is complete bollocks. 

Most that say this are early in their journey and their head for want of a better way to put it, is a complete mess due to quitting. They‚Äôre angry, irrational, anxious and depressed. I get it, I‚Äôve been there. The others that have multiple years under their belt and claim to be ‚Äòfighting every day‚Äô more often than not are quitting or are habituated to another substance. There‚Äôs always more to the story. One look at their post history shows you all you need to determine their motive for their posts.

If you‚Äôre reading this, and feel like you can‚Äôt breath, you can‚Äôt concentrate, you can‚Äôt imagine a world without being a slave. I promise you, you can and that world exists. 

Time will heal your addiction. Trust me.

I am 34 years old and I started smoking when I was around 16 or 17.  For most of that time, a pack would last me ~4/5 days, depending on how busy/stressed I was at work, or how much time I'd spend out with friends.  I've been an American Spirit smoker for probably 95% of that time.

I've been with my now-wife since June of '09, and she's hated cigarettes the entire time.  It's always been a default reason for us to get into a fight.

Anyway, she's 40 weeks pregnant.  Yesterday was our baby's due date, but he's still cozy in his mom's belly.  I've always told myself I'll quit before we have kids, so here I am holding myself to my own word.

Throughout the pandemic, I've slowly been tapering myself down.  I'd gotten myself down to one (or sometimes two) per day over the last few months.  A few weeks ago I noticed my pack was getting low, and I told myself it'd be my last, so I stretched it out as long as I could.

Fast forward 18 days, and I'm sitting here craving a cigarette.  I don't even think it's necessarily the nicotine?  I miss the ritual.  I miss bundling up to go outside and watch the city lights and traffic buzz by.  I miss the burn in my throat.  I miss flicking the ash and watching the smoke dance into the sky.

At what point does it get easier?  Does it ever get easier?  I don't think I'll ever be over it completely.  I think I'll always miss it.

I'm a very stubborn person, tho.  So I know I won't give in.  

I just feel like venting to someone who ""gets it"" you know?",17

Hey all, 

My last cigarette was nearly two years ago today, right before midnight on New Year's Day. I went from smoking nearly a pack a day to cold turkey and pushed through the worst of everything in the months that followed.

I've recently moved back home after two years, due to financial constraints and find myself living alone for the first time. Whenever I go  out on the porch, I get hit by these really intense cravings as that used to be my morning routine. Wake up, head out to have a smoke before breakfast.

Anyway, I'm trying to power through the cravings now and I'm finding it harder to ignore them in solitude than it was when I had people around me.

Can people please post their favorite post-quitting moments to help remind me why I quit in the first place?

I was vaping for 2 years and 3 months straight starting in September of 2018 at the age of 20. I began with a JUUL as a partying favour, then switched over to a STLTH device after 6-7 months (February 2019). The STLTH device I was smoking consisted of 2ml pods with 50mg of nicotine in each ml and I was finishing approximately a pod per a day and a half or so. Pretty quickly, it had developed into chain smoking vaping - from approx 10am to 12-1am every day. 

This July of 2020, I picked up recreational marijuana smoking (dealing with the boredom of COVID) which led to daily smoking (from bongs) - sometimes all day, others just at night along with my vaping. 

I began to notice decreased appetite obviously over my time vaping but in August of 2020, I noticed a lot of stomach and chest pain when eating which eventually induced vomiting. After reaching out to doctors, I was notified acid reflux was what I was suffering from - induced from the constant vaping and marijuana. I was given a prescription to fix the acid reflux but was told I had to quit to vaping and smoking of all sorts - which I DID NOT do. 

Throughout this time, I dealt with some mental stresses - mainly relationship based that was stressing me out. This combined with my acid reflux was bringing down my quality of life. 

From August 2020 to December 2020, I was barely eating as anything would make the acid reflux ignite as I kept vaping and smoking marijuana which made the acid reflux prescription not work. However, smoking marijuana was the only thing that got me to eat and vaping kept my emotions stables. 

Eventually, I felt so drained from my relationship stresses and acid reflux - I ended up having a full blown anxiety meltdown with a lot of vomiting that felt induced from emotions and smoking/reflux. This meltdown was so bad it brought me to the emergency room where I was told I absolutely needed to quit smoking for everything to get better. This was on December 11th, and that day I smoked my last vape and bong. 

I originally tried to just put it all down and quit cold turkey. Within hours, the anxiety levels were high again - just like in the ER - which led me to attempt to quit with Nicotine patches. I originally started on December 12th with the 14mg (step2) patches. I wore them 24 hours for 3 days - felt fatigue, a bit anxious but doing okay. 

On the 3rd night, December 15th, I felt an uncontrollable sadness - I could not stop crying and I didn‚Äôt know why. I tried to sleep it off, but woke up the next day feeling the same way. I reached out to a local detox centre (not professionals, former addicts who help) over the phone, who suggested my dosage of nicotine was too low and suggested reaching out to a doctor for medication to help with my mood. 

I immediately went to the pharmacy and got the 21mg patches (step1), put one on and headed to a local walk in doctor (I‚Äôm a 23 year old student, living away from home, walk in doctors are my only access.) I will mention at this day 3 point, any urge of vomiting was gone just like the doctors said would stop with no longer smoking. 

The doctor didn‚Äôt tell me much, looked into my pupils, and gave me a prescription for ‚Äúsomething to help calm me down‚Äù. When filling the prescription, the pharmacists notified me this would be an anti depressant - which completely set off my unstable mood. I immediately went home and continued to feel the lows, so I took one of the anti depressants. About an hour after, I felt the urge to vomit (who knows what from at this point). The lows and anxiety continued throughout the night but no fatigue anymore I was wide awake all night, any tiny bit of sleep I got I felt haunted by nightmares. 

The next morning, I called my family who came and got me, we reached out to my family doctor that day and got to talk with the registered nurse of the office who acknowledged my feelings as completely normal for someone going through withdrawals but still with how I was feeling and acting to go to the local emergency and speak with the psychological department. I had yet to take an anti depressant this day as I was unsure what to do and was scared it would make me throw up again. 

THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE IF YOURE STILL KEEPING UP. 

At the hospital, the nurses and doctors in the ER just looked me in the eye and said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre depressed sweetie‚Äù - I pushed to talk to someone more in the mental health area which got me a crisis nurse. When speaking with him, a lot of life style habits were discussed (relationship stresses, family stresses) as maybe I was going through withdrawals but maybe there is something more going on.

I will say though I have never shown symptoms of any psychological disorders, no one in my family has felt the need to get me ‚Äúlooked at‚Äù - so it was a bit confusing for my case. Leaving the hospital after a few hours, I was given a mental health worker and also a psychiatrist - I have yet to be assessed by either still on December 28th. 

I was given an anti psychotic for ‚Äúsleep aid‚Äù, a small dose of 5mg (I looked more into these after being given the anti depressants, this is completely normal for suffering from insomnia). 


Anyways, throughout all of this, I truly believed I was crazy and could be anything - bipolar, schizophrenia, etc. because I felt so low. That night, I took the anti psychotic, I was terrorized with bad nightmares again, waking up every couple hours in sweats. At this point, I don‚Äôt even think my body or brain knew what was happening I felt completely empty. 

Waking up the next day, the feeling dreaded on. I got in touch with my family doctor directly finally, who mentioned this probably was all just really bad withdrawals mixed with stresses, she did an assessment of me to send to this psychiatrist I will eventually talk to. She also suggested that actually my patches were too HIGH now which could be also giving me anxiety, and wearing them at night would give me insomnia plus night terrors. For the anti psychotic and anti depressants, she suggested trying to go without until speaking with a psychiatrist- especially if it was making me ill in anyway. Instead, she suggested vitamin D supplements daily. This was on December 17th. 

Starting December 18th, I went down to 14mg patches for only a limited amount of time usually 10am -8 or 9pm. Additionally, I was only taking my acid reflux medication and vitamin D every morning. My sleeping was stable, fatigue a couple hours after the patch is taken off, appetite raising, mood was still low but stable and increased each day. 

Over the next few days, I started keeping the patch on less and then every other day. I think I may have rushed this, but my high moods kept me motivated (wrong idea). Today, on December 28th, I didn‚Äôt wear the patch and haven‚Äôt had one on since the night before at 9pm. I was extremely irritable, sad and anxious all day, randomly crying and this evening, it really took a toll. I popped a nicorette gum in and relied on my support system and I‚Äôm starting to feel some relief. 

NOW: My question is from other vapers who quit: did you suffer from a similar situation? I know my story is different than most but could all my feelings be from withdrawals? I believe so, as my mood increased over the decrease of nicotine over slow time. I think my break tonight might‚Äôve been me rushing into quitting once again. I also wanted to ask those who suffered from it - did you take any anti depressants throughout the process? (I really do not want to). I also believe my acid reflux decreasing my quality of life, along with quitting both marijuana and vaping could lead to this giant collapse. 

I really appreciate ANY insight and opinions but please remember I‚Äôm only 23 and I am trying to beat my addiction, I don‚Äôt need any more negativity. 

Thank you so much in advance.",3

When my ex had split I went and bought chew. I have been an on and off nicotine user (but like 98% of the time off) but I started using almost a whole tin a day (ouches) rather quickly.  Like the addict I am, I spend about as much waking time in my mouth with dip in my mouth than without it. 

I am extremely depressed as is and this is making it work. I just bought lozenges and am also on Wellbutrin. Do you think this will work to tame the withdrawals of a very short term but very heavy use habit? I notice withdrawals pretty shortly after a chew.

I have been a lurker of this sub for quite a while now. I decided to join reddit and join this wonderful supportive group.  I started smoking Newports at the age of 18 which I then switched to Marlboro Reds. Fast forward and I am now 26 and afraid that I'm chained to this addiction. The first day is the easiest for me no withdrawal symptoms until about day 2-3. I'm honestly scared of the withdrawal because I heard about quitters flu. 

I was a heroin and benzo addict and have about 4 months clean. Withdrawing multiple times and relapsing left me with PTSD about quitting anything else. That was literally hell on earth but oddly enough it doesn't compare to cigarettes. Cigarettes are engraved in every aspect of my life as opposed to heroin which I couldn't do at a certain time or place. Cigs are everywhere and everything is a craving. 

My question for this sub is how do I get over that fear that I'm going to be feeling the same month long sickness, malaise, depression, anxiety and insomnia. Just the thought of not having to sleep for a week or longer makes my hands sweaty. Everytime I'm at that spot it feels like a giant hole I can't climb out off. I don't want to do anything can't stand anything and anyone im just there living but dead inside just being miserable. Hobbies? Movies? Exercise? Shieeeet I wish I had the energy and motivation to do something. When I hear of people say stay busy how the flip do you even do that given that I'm literally dead for a month. 

Thanks for taking a read and for any replies I might get. Also, I'd like to add I never fully committed to quitting cigarettes and my assumption of the withdrawal is just purely based on what I read, hear, and past experiences so if there are any opiate users out there please please leave a comment to tell me how it compares and what did you do to overcome that shittines.",7

I never ever thought I'd be able to stop, and I have, and I'm so happy. Smoking was 100% part of my identity and had been since I was a 16-year-old depressed goth girl and now I've not had a smoke in 3 whole fucking months, since I last had a gross half a rollie in my friend's back garden and that was it. I just wanted to share my story... 

I'd been getting freaked about my age (34) for ages and how I was \*still\* smoking even though I promised myself I'd quit at 30.  I started to super focus on why I was still doing it, and how disgusting it was. Covid helped, with the huge lack of parties and festivals and socialising where I'd always want to smoke a lot to help me 'enjoy it' more. So untrue. 

As a kid I used to smoke with the best of them, always had a pack at university, went travelling in asia and **constantly** smoked to keep boredom away. I managed to get it down to social smoking/drunk/high smoking only, then tried to quit a bunch of times with a vape, but I always ended up keeping the addiction. I'd end up making up excuses, getting wasted and begging smokes off my friends or giving up after a super bad day or a huge row with my boyfriend or something and go smoke on the balcony to cool off. 

I live in London and my friends and I all 'party' pretty often together (if you know what I mean - passing DVD cases around a coffee table etc, but also festivals, parties, warehouses, raves, etc).  For years I convinced myself I'd always fail in those situations - so I always did. Eventually, I secretly looked forward to an event like that where I knew I could 'justify' my smoking while having a big night. 

After I quit, I cannot put into words just how much I was dreading that first time I was drunk or high (which is like 5 times harder than just drunk IMO) and wouldn't smoke - sober is one thing, etc. 

The first time, I'm not going to lie, there were a few moments where it was extremely challenging sitting in my friend's tiny livingroom filled with smoke while they all shared spliffs (I don't like weed, thank god.) and not mentally justifying to myself -""Well, if they all get to smoke tobacco like this, I should get some too!"" That was the one time I used the hell out of my vape. But I'm super proud of myself. I never thought I could do this. 

I still might have a go on someone's vape as a treat when I'm extra-wasted but it barely even registers to me as nicotine anymore - a friend who also quit came over to mine for an eve and she was on my case to go dig my vape out. I'd not even thought of the shitty vape that eve - that was when I felt my proudest for kicking my nicotine habit. (Not judging anyone who used it, I definitely feel my previous attempts to quit with a vape helped me stop entirely - it was all part of my process.) 

I love waking up from hangovers without that feeling of horrible sludge and tar and that nasty cough. I love that I can run way further now. I love not having the shame of trying to sneak out when I'm visiting family. I love not having cravings or that sinking feeling of spending another ¬£13 on another pack of awful tobacco. I love not feeling frantic and panicked when I'm upset turning the house upside down looking for my pack. I can't wait to get to next year so I can say it's been a whole year. 

It's an amazing feeling and it's worth every bit of struggle.",6

Anyways, I quit for about 3 days now and I find myself thinking that doing 1 or 2 is fine. Have done it before in the past and it just led me to smoke again full time. 

But its weird because on the one hand I dont want to smoke anymore, and on the other I really like smoking and feel like I have a few years ahead of me before I need to quit. I realized these are mind games and have to stay strong though, so this time im in it for the long run.

I suffer from mild to severe episodes of depression and smoking always was a way for short term stress relief. A break from all the bullshit in my brain - five minutes of solace.

I'm not in an episode right now, but my life could be easier. I wanted to quit in a time of relative high stress to instantly learn to cope with said stress without resorting to light one up.

In the past all my attempts were in times of relative ease, good mental health and general happyness. But when that one doctor assaulted me, when that one relationship did not work out I immediately began to smoke again.

I don't want to live through this kind of failure again. I know the path I chose is one of the harder ones, and that is also a reason for this fucking incredible insomnia. But I know what awaits on the other side of all this pain. The real possibility of a smoke free life, even when it gets hard, stressfull or I enter another episode of depression.

To lose my five minutes of solace is a really hard and big step that is still scary for me.

So far my hips have been covered in 6-7 itchy raised welts everyday, a spot fades as a new patch goes on. Not a huge price to pay compared to $55/pack and coughing in my sleep. 

It's been really amazing to see my acne healing, be able to cook a well balanced dish, taste chocolate properly and realise just how much my hair stank like stale smoke. I can see the rewards in freedom from the cycle.

Nicotine supplements only makes it worse...best way to go is cold Turkey...

Friends' and family's support is critical.. you can never quit if you are surrounded by smokers. Declare your decision to the world and demand that nobody not only smokes around you but talking about smoking is also prohibited around you.

Cravings will be there for long long period of time... You have to figure out your own way/remedy to control it. It can be reward to yourself by bucket of ice cream/ big bag of chips...or punishment of 5 km running if you fail.. whatever suits you but you have to have carrot or stick for your self.. no edible item is unhealthier than cigarettes so go crazy on reward... Weight loss will be cakewalk compared to quiting.

Your brain will play games with you for cigarettes... e.g ""You have not smoked for a month now you are not a smoker anymore, so you can have one or two puff...it wont harm you, anyway you know how to quit now."" "" Poor you, you had very bad exhausting week, relaxing with a glass of your favourite bourbon whisky, and just one cigarette is what you deserve""
Dont give in to any of that bullshit.

Good thing is you learn to control cravings after sometime because your brain eventually runs out of trickery...by my personal experience cravings consistently gets decreased by frequency and intensity both. After a month each turned down craving you can be sure that next will be further later and milder than previous.

Last thing if you fail once is not end of the world or is not license to become smoker again..if you fail once, dont give up on yourself. Come out stronger that you will not give in Again. You tricked me once i dare you trick me again... identify your brains trick and ward it off miles away next time ...


Thanks for reading if anyone does. I was just feeling happy that now i can enjoy my glass of bourbon without those red little devils...and i dont miss them even slightest...thank you.",106

https://archives.drugabuse.gov/news-events/nida-notes/2009/10/abstinent-smokers-nicotinic-receptors-take-more-than-month-to-normalize

My unprofessional understanding of the matter:
Acetylcholine has so many important roles in the brain, from sleep to attention and arausal. A quick Google search will show you.
Nicotine activates the acetylcholine receptors and due to constant nicotine when smoking, those are upregulated. When we stop smoking we are left with lots of receptors, and little nicotine to activate them. So we feel bad, we can't sleep properly, can't concentrate, and many other side effects.

In some people the levels of the receptors go back to normal quicker than in others. But this research shows that it can take up to 12 weeks, so don't lose hope, and don't feel like you're doomed when people tell you you should have already been feeling better. It takes time.",19

First off, does anyone else experience bizarre complacency at the thought of global calamity? For instance, if there were a meteor set to destroy the earth, I know my first instinct would be to buy a carton of my smoke of choice. In a way I long for a reality where I could puff up again without long term consequence.


Secondly, what do the rest of you do about dreams? It seems that most of my dreams involve me wandering off from the ""main story"" to buy a pack and start smoking as soon as possible. I've been able to resist this temptation in real life but while dreaming it seems like second nature.


Lastly I'd like to congratulate everyone else that's successfully kicked the habit and wish you all the best into 2021. I know we can do it but it's a tricky thing and the support on this sub and other places is helpful. Thanks to you all and happy new year!",8

For me, so far, I haven't had any trouble quitting. The first few days I had the occasional craving, but nothing that was easily forgotten after 5 minutes. My girlfriend smokes and even that doesn't bother me. Every time she goes out for a cigarette it makes me feel like I've won. I feel a lot better already, cleaner, and for some strange reason have a lot less anxiety now. I didn't realize smoking even caused me anxiety until I quit. (Unless it's in my head. Idk.) Part of me thinks the Tobacco Industry pays to campaign how hard it is to quit smoking. The only reason I didn't attempt to quit sooner is because I've heard ""It's extremely hard to quit smoking"" my whole life.

I've always heard the ""3 day hump"" but I see post on here of people having trouble not smoking after months without a cig. That worries me.

Family and friends helping a lot.,"Pack a day for 10 years (28M). Love smoking, friends never thought I'd quit. Stopped renting with the missus and moved back in with parents to save up for a house a few months ago (we agreed we're almost close to a deposit but rent was just killing us, especially with her in furlough). Lockdown happened. A lot of stress about this. Ended up with a bad chest infection (Not Covid thankfully) a really bad one but, as a smoker, ""well it's not cancer is it?""  So I decided to have a smoke, but I just couldn't. Mainly because I was ill but it just tasted like shit for some reason, I can't explain it. Then I realised I was so hooked on smoking I'd rather have a fag than just relax and get better so I dramatically ripped up my fags and threw them in the bin. Haven't had one since. 

First day was horrible, worst I've ever felt. Ill, withdrawal, panic work as it's last day since annual Christmas leave from work so I'm cramming up January and February work in a days. Chest infection all gone now, but I honestly have never felt better. Haven't had any symptoms until today. Decided to watch Goodfellas and boy the cravings hit hard, but I pushed through. No mood swings yet. My dad was apparently moody and horrible after quitting at 55 after smoking since he was 8(!).

What's helped a lot is how my friends and families have treated me. My friends set up a betting pool on how long I'd last knowing damn well how pissed off and stubborn I would be to prove them wrong and my family have routinely taken turns to read out facts about what cigarettes do (a lot of facts about penis and bloodflow unfortunately). Sometimes during dinner, sometimes early in the morn while I'm still sleeping. My girlfriend has helped figure out a new routine for stuff that replaces to weird habit of going outside to breathe poison for 5 minutes each time for absolutely not reason.

Felt panic because my health began to deteriorate so quickly even though I‚Äôm still in my mid 30s. Also felt scared of complications later in life.

I used to smoke about 10 cigs a day, every day. Finally made up my mind and bought a supply of nicotine gum. Just 2mg dose a piece since I felt 4mg might be overkill.

Immediately stopped smoking as soon as I started chewing gum. Not a puff since. Threw my lighter away in the trash.

It was difficult for the first few days. And then it suddenly felt much, much easier. Now it‚Äôs three weeks in and I don‚Äôt even think about smoking at all. Just chew my gum 2-3 times a day.

Determined to keep on relying on gum for probably the next 2-3 months. I read that weaning too early may result in relapse. Better take a safe path here.

I found the thing that helped me the most was to draw up a list of triggers. And try to shake up my routine a bit to avoid those triggers. Mine included hot coffee, big meal, certain smoking corners I used to frequent, and being alone at home during evening.

Now I notice I have more stamina and can breathe much easier during cardio workout. My lips are returning to their natural color after 10+ years of living with darkened lips. All my stuff smell nice!

TLDR; NRT works for me so far. But it‚Äôll take more than NRT to help you quit. Avoid triggers and old habits. Health benefits are immediate and remarkable if you can make it past 2-week mark.

Happy quitting!",3

2020-12-26 10:28:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/kkk8p9/cravings_getting_more_and_more_intense/,Cravings getting more and more intense,"So this Christmas marked 7 months since I quit smoking. I'd smoked for three years, since I was 17. I quit because of anxiety about my health. 

Considering all my friends smoked and I smoked the most out of all of them, I was surprised I was able to quit without any cravings. None until about two weeks ago, that is, where I started having occasional cravings. Today I'm having some really strong ones. Strong enough to make me fear I'll relapse, which is saying something, considering how anxious I was about my health.

The cravings could be caused by the fact that my anxiety has gotten worse after quitting, to the point I'm having trouble sleeping (sleep anxiety actually). 

Has anyone else only had cravings this long after quitting. And anyone else ever had worse anxiety so long after quitting? It's a chicken or the egg situation for me, don't know if I'm having cravings because of anxiety or having worse anxiety because I've stopped smoking.",4

2020-12-25 21:11:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/kkakbz/quit_smoking_but_please_do_not_trade_it_for_vaping/,"Quit smoking, but PLEASE do not trade it for vaping","I‚Äôm writing this testimonial to show you all the hate and frustration I‚Äôve built against vaping throughout all the years I‚Äôve tried to give this ‚Äútobacco alternative‚Äù a chance, and to save the time and money of people still deciding if they should take the same step. I‚Äôve wasted more than a THOUSAND dollars on equipment and materials until I reached the conclusion that NONE are reliable or satisfying in the long run - every single one of them have failed me and I know most of you will relate to my terrible experience. I‚Äôll try to cover every single one them in the next paragraphs.

Let‚Äôs start with beginner vaping devices. Most people nowadays start their vaping journey with pod systems and I advise you: avoid them at ALL COSTS. I can‚Äôt even grasp how can these vaping devices be the preferred alternative. They are way underpowered, give you zero control over your vape and the taste, oh Lord the taste, it is SO DAMN BLAND. I‚Äôd rather stick my lips around a cow‚Äôs ass and suck, at least I‚Äôd taste the shit out of it. A pod system is like sucking air. And let‚Äôs talk about the pods: they have really low capacity for liquid, most of them are unrefillable (the worst choice if you are environmentally minded) and are expensive as hell (if you want to save money in regards to a pack of cigs think twice), not to talk about the very limited flavours you can choose from. I‚Äôm aware there are some pod systems that use refillable pods and have airflow control to try to make the experience similar to smoking a cig, I‚Äôve tried those, but no. Nothing compared to a cig - the MTL experience on these suck ass (not even close to the restrictiveness of a cig), the coils die way too fucking quick and are also expensive as hell, and the flavour is still terrible, like sucking air from a straw. Not to mention the regular spit back of some pod systems that totally ruin the experience.

After using pod systems and getting tired of the lame vaping experience, most users jump to more powerful devices: the mods, oh the mods. You can use different types of tanks on these, from the ones using pre-built coils to the RTAs or RDAs (or RDTAs or squonk kits or whatever, I won‚Äôt get too much in detail on these because they are variants of the same clusterfuck).

The most practical of these are the tanks with pre-built coils, you just have to change the coils once in a while, refill the tank and that‚Äôs it. Or is it? Every single one of these tanks come with a damn problem. Many of them present leaking problems that turn them into a nightmare if you want to take your vape outside. The flavour? It depends on the coils, but let‚Äôs not fool ourselves, the pre-built coils are a shot in the dark. These are AGAIN disposable expensive pieces of garbage, costing around 3 USD each (independently of the brand). In rare occasions you‚Äôll get one that will live for like two weeks before burning out, most of them will burn in few days, and sometimes you‚Äôll get a coil that doesn‚Äôt function at all. For the ones that work, they may taste great on the first day, but after that you‚Äôll be stuck to waste your precious juice on a coil that turns it into evaporated urine. You‚Äôll be wasting more money on these damn lame-ass coils than on the juice itself. Want more flavour? Crank the power of your mod up or restrict more your airflow, and destroy your coil in less than a day. But at least you‚Äôve wasted those 3 USD on a good puff.

After vapers realize they‚Äôve spent waaaay to much money on tanks using pre-built coils (trying to find the one that doesn‚Äôt exist), they take the step of buying a RTA (rebuildable tank atomizer) or a RDA (rebuildable dripping atomizer). These are way cheaper, because you just have to buy the wire and the cotton and make your own coils, instead of those expensive and short-lived pre-built coils. Or are they?

Let‚Äôs start with the RDAs, the less practical way of vaping you can imagine. There‚Äôs no tank involved, only a deck and a chimney, meaning you‚Äôll have to carry around your bottles of juice and drip the juice on the coils every single fucking time you want to vape. Shouldn‚Äôt vaping be a relaxing experience? Why should I waste more time on building the damn coils and carrying a bag around with all my vaping material instead of the vaping itself? I won‚Äôt deny though, the flavour on RDAs is superb, because you vape fresh juice instead of the diarrhoea that marinates inside a tank and because the coils are closer to your mouth. The negative point that ruins RDAs for me though? The damn spit back. Would you put out a cigarette with your tongue? That‚Äôs what it feels like. And it‚Äôs a totally random event, with makes vaping on RDAs even more stressful. One puff tastes great, the next puff tastes like boiling oil pouring into your mouth.

And then there are the RTAs, for those who don‚Äôt want to carry bottles around. These are basically RDAs but with a tank. Are they more practical though? Big NO. I don‚Äôt know who are the braindead engineers behind these, but the design on all of them has serious flaws, from massive leaks to floods of the decks (which makes you waste even more juice), and again, spit back. Most vaping snobs will tell you that‚Äôs because you wick your coils the wrong way - bullshit. I bet you‚Äôre so in denial that you can‚Äôt feel the spit backs anymore, because your tongue has turned into crisp by now. It doesn‚Äôt really matter how you wick. I mean, there's a correct way of wicking a coil, but even when you wick it correctly the same shit happens. Especially on RTAs, you‚Äôll have to be surgical in the way you coil but, in the end, even if you build the Saint Graal of coils, same shit will happen sooner or later, which again makes all this experience very stressful and non-sensical.

Now about the juices. Regardless of if you use nicotine or not, if you want to try the juices just don‚Äôt, first because all of the above, and second because you‚Äôd rather eat real candy from the supermarket - that‚Äôs what ALL damn juices taste like, the flavours are sweet and artificial as fuck. And they are also expensive. I‚Äôm not even talking about premium juices (that taste the fucking same to the cheaper ones), a cheap bottle of 50mL liquid may cost you around 10 USD. What if you don‚Äôt like the flavour? Too bad son, waste more 10 USD on a different flavour you may or may not like, or keep vaping that vomit-inducing piece of piss. Most will say you can make your own juices if you want a cheaper option, but fuck me, I just want to fucking vape, I don‚Äôt want to waste even more time on e-liquid chemistry lessons or coil engineering, is that asking much?

Now, the vaping community. I don‚Äôt need to talk about it, just read the comments that will rain on this post and you‚Äôll get the idea.

And about all the vaping channels reviewing vaping products I have big advise for you, TRUST NO VAPING CHANNEL. Almost every single one of them is sponsored by the brands they are reviewing and they will lie just to shove a product down your throat. And even if some of the reviews are actually genuine, these channels usually just try the product once and give their opinion after two or three puffs. Like I said above, most will taste great and have no issues the first time you try, but the next day the coils will fail, the tank will leak, the juice will spit back at you, and after a week you‚Äôll be thinking about wasting more 50 USD or so in a new equipment recommended by channel X. Hell, I remember this specific RTA being advertised as the RTA of the year, first in all of the top tens on the web, and then 90% of its users posting on forums complaining about it being completely unusable due to the massive spit back. This was real, I bought it myself and can testify that this RTA was a volcano shooting lava into my mouth, no solutions whatsoever. Ended up in the trash can like most of the vaping equipment I ever bought and like my faith in vaping.

So in the end, which device would I recommend you if you want to take your daily dose of nicotine without the well known dangers of tobacco? A pod system? An RTA kit? A pre-built? None of these. Just eat a fucking eggplant, the real cheap and practical alternative to tobacco. What if you just want to try vaping for the sake of it? You can, if you have money you just want to throw down the shitter, or if you want to waste hours of your life and months of your income building coils and buying new equipment, for it to flip the bird on you EVERY SINGLE TIME. The prime example in terms of planned obsolescence.",36

I have been struggling with a nicotine addiction for upwards of two years now. I began vaping when I was introduced to it by a friend shortly before I became 18. I started with a very low concentration and always left my dorm room to vape. It seemed like an okay habit and study aid to me, and it (appeared) to help me self-educate a mental and phisiological I've dealt with my whole life. 

Things when down hill when I became okay with smoking indoors. One of my friends who quit also offered me their high concentration juices and that just made the problem worse. Eventually, after smoking for six months I quit for a major sports event I was training for. 

After I stopped smoking I craved cigarettes and a vape frequently. It almost felt the same as being hungry. I managed to stay quit for about three months but ended up cracking during a particularly intense season of finals, or I guess, that's the excuse I gave myself to relapse, I don't know. 

Almost a year later and I've upped my concentration of nicotine to an insane level. I smoke a rediculous amount. But I'd really like to change that. 

Recently I've entered into a relationship with the sweetest girl. I've finally seen a doctor for the first time in my life and gotten my the extremes of my condition managed with actual medication. I think it's time for me to quit again. 

I'd like to quite cold turkey because from all of my research it seems to be the most effective way to quit. And I've quit cold turkey before so I understand what I'm in for as for how awful it is. 

I'd really like it if I could rope someone in here to be an accountability partner with. There's really no one else in my life who smokes, or smokes and wants to quit. 

At the very least, some encouragement to quit and how much better a smoke free life is would be awesome. 

Thank you reddit,
Have a lovely day!",6

Some people may remember almost 4 years ago when somebody was talking about smoking a specific drug which name I do not recall. Even after warnings from several people, the person crushed up around 15 dried seeds and took them. 

Some days later, the person commented, ‚ÄúGoogle.com how normal make it stop‚Äù or something similar. It was obvious that the seeds were taking affect on his sanity at this point. Some days later, he had found a post on r/gaming about TABS, where two mammoths were fighting. He had commented something along the lines of ‚Äúno good, big dogs fighting. Ma stop‚Äù which could be translated to ‚ÄúNot good, the mammoths are fighting. Make it stop.‚Äù

Said he did his patches in the morning so they'd be less potent by bedtime, so I figured I needed to switch. Yesterday, I hit the bar and tied one on, took the patch off 20 hours into it. Smoked 3 cigarettes (over about 5 hours) before going to bed relatively early. Wake up at 7am, slap a patch on. That was 19 hours ago. I am still having issues with sleeping. Not even tired.

I rolled a last big rollie with the tobacco I had left and I'm not planning on buying more (I also can't afford to buy more, but I know from experience that an addict usually makes a plan) so this is it.

I've thrown my ashtrays, my pack of tobacco papers and filters and the pack itself into a paper bag and I'm disposing of it later today. I didn't plan it to be on Christmas eve, but I'll take it - this will be my present to myself. In 2017 I quit weed for good, in 2018 I stopped drinking alcohol, in 2019 I cut down my sugar intake by like 90% (I love that single spoon of sugar in my tea too much) and now, 2020, I'm done smoking.

I‚Äôve been smoking for 16 years, (m32), and I‚Äôve recently decided to quit. 

Currently on medication to assist in the quitting, here in Australia is called Champix. So far it‚Äôs working well I‚Äôve cut down from my 10-15 per day to 1-3 per day. But I‚Äôm at the end of my 2nd month of meds and it‚Äôs getting over that last hurdle and stopping completely that becoming the most difficult aspect. 

3 weeks ago I threw out all of my ash trays and extra lighters. 

I recently had a day where my partner and I wend and visited her family for a function and I didn‚Äôt take my packet of smokes with me or a lighter. I was pretty happy with that effort. 

My partner is great and supportive but she‚Äôs never smoked and her family don‚Äôt smoke. So the support they give is great and I am thankful for that. However I get this nagging thought in the back of my head that they have no idea what one going through or what it‚Äôs like. 

Because I‚Äôve smoked for so long and have used it in social situations as a crutch, to get out of situations I feel uncomfortable in, socialising with other smokers, stress relief etc, I‚Äôm fearful of what I‚Äôm going to do once I quit. 
Basically I‚Äôm looking for the smokers version of Alcoholics Anonymous. Something like that? 

Any ideas?

2020-12-23 14:33:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/kizljd/binary_decision_making/,Binary decision making,"I heard a clip from Jocko Willink's podcast where he talks about binary decision making that has helped me quit nicotine. Computers work with binary code, 0's and 1's. 0 = no or false, 1 = yes or true. There's no in between, those are the two things a computer understands, yes or no. Jocko talked about how it's easy to put your brain in that mode if you make an effort to do it and I've found that to be the case as well.

Are you going to smoke? Yes or no? You're only going to do it socially? You're going to taper off of it? You're going to quit later? That wasn't the question, the question was are you going to smoke, yes or no. You can smoke socially, taper off, or quit later, sure, but in binary code you have to understand that that's answering yes, so don't view it as smoking socially, you are smoking. If someone asks if you're back on nicotine again, don't say you're trying to quit, tapering off, that's bull shit and you know it. You are smoking.

Viewing it this way helped me big time. Despite what we tell ourselves, quitting smoking isn't some huge struggle, battle, ordeal, or anything like that, it's just not doing a thing. You can not smoke the same way a computer doesn't run a program its user decides not to run, only in this case you're the user and the computer. I hope this helped someone",14

2020-12-22 19:47:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/kiib95/havent_had_a_cigarette_in_2_days/,Haven't had a cigarette in 2 days,"So, I've been smoking cigarettes for 12 years. I've been at a pack a day of strong cigarettes for about 9 years. I've tried quitting smoking at least 3 times. I've tried tapering off, cold-turkey, and using e-cigs (back when they were awful and didn't help at all). The longest I've lasted without a cigarette was a little over a month, but one night of drinking got me smoking the same amount I was, if not a little more. After the withdrawal symptoms I experienced last time, I was terrified of quitting.

I'm the type of smoker that starts getting antsy for a cigarette every hour. With the economy being the way it is right now, I can't afford to keep smoking, which was my big push to try something different. I had other reasons too, like my health (I can't stand being as winded as I have been, and honestly, I get so many respiratory infections, a pandemic causing pneumonia is my own personal hell), but I am so addicted to cigarettes that it took two car breakdowns and being unable to afford another repair to really push me to quit. If I wasn't smoking for all of these years, I could've afforded it. I can't stand how much cigarettes have a hold on me. I am 100% addicted to cigarettes and will do anything I can to get my fix. I would go without food if I had to, as long as it meant I would have a pack. When I would try to quit/cut down, the thought of not having cigarettes available to me would send me straight to the gas station. It's so bad, I have not applied to certain jobs because I don't think I could handle not having a smoke break. It makes no sense, but that's what years of addiction has done to my brain. 

A few weeks ago, I decided to buy a disposable vape to see if that would work for me. I don't care how long it takes me, as long as I am moving in the right direction. For me, the act of smoking is more addicting than the chemicals/nicotine in cigarettes (I'm definitely addicted to those too). I used both for those few weeks, eventually tapering down to 1 cigarette a day with help from the vape. 

I wasn't sure if it would work at first, but the last pack of cigarettes I bought was a couple of weeks ago. This is the longest I've went without buying a pack of cigarettes in 6 years. I'm relying pretty heavily on the vape, but to me, that's okay as long as I can stay off of cigarettes. I'm still experiencing withdrawals, but they are so mild compared to he withdrawals I've experienced in the past. This is nothing, and for the first time, I'm confident about kicking the habit for good. Although I don't want to vape forever, I'm at the point where I've realized it's not a race. What has worked for others hasn't worked for me, and I have a lot beyond the physical addiction to work through. 

In a couple of weeks, I'm going to buy an actual vape and start slowly reducing the amount of nicotine every few weeks until I hit 0. After I hit 0, I can deal with the psychological issues and make the remaining lifestyle changes I might still be dealing with. If I need an extra week on a certain amount, that's fine with me, as long as I don't go back and I'm moving forward. 

Even though I still have a long ways to go, I am so happy that I've gotten this far. Less than a month ago, going a day without a cigarette seemed impossible. Baby steps. Sorry if this was a little redundant or I was talking in circles. I am feeling a little foggier than usual working through some of these withdrawals. It's much much better than trying to quit cold turkey though. Last time, I couldn't remember what someone said to me 2 seconds before.",7

This is the recurring craving that i have and i am fighting against. Me leaning against my car under a tree in an open field with a light breeze (i am in FL). Take out a cigarette smell it, light it and i feel the smoke going down my throat with that spicy bitterness, continuing to my lungs and exhaling.

Around a month and a half I started taking Pfizer's Champix/Chantix (Varenicline), I stopped on day 14 of taking the drug and now it's been 17 days since my last cigarette.

For the past few days I have been abnormally angry and out of character even about silly things.

Anyone with a similar experience?

**UPDATE: Day 21**

The symptoms mentioned above resolved within 24 hours (lasted the total of 4 days and peaked in the last day). When I consulted my smoking cessation doctor, she strongly insisted I get a nicotine gum to avoid these symptoms although I was hesitant, I got the gum, used one, and that was that with a plan to use it when needed only.

**UPDATE: Day 31**

The abnormal agitation and cranky mood showed up again for the past week at least, I am on a 2mg nicotine gum and my doctor advised me to stop Chantix as I have been abstinent for 31 days to isolate the symptoms and see whether these symptoms are caused by the drug or the withdrawal symptoms.

I should mention here that the symptoms are not serious at all, its just bothering for me since I am an extremely quiet person.",286

But the singular thing that could potentially drive me back into the poisons arms is this feeling of ""brain fog"".

In the past I've continued to medicate my brain with either alcohol or weed. After getting married in 2016 and having two beautiful baby girls I picked back up the daily weed and drinking habit. I drove my family's life into the ground. It was a lesson I had to learn and I'm eternally grateful that my wife saw my potential and stuck it out with me. 
I gave up the weed and alcohol almost at the same time (within the 30 days of one another). And as I have in the past, when I quit something, I give myself a crutch with another substance. This time, I traded weed and alcohol for nicotine. 
But I AM DONE. My conscience and heart never let me rest. I love my family so much and my heart's number one desire is to be healthy and mentally available for them, while enjoying THEIR company and companionship and not that of a nicotine containing substance. 
In the past I've tried to play superman and quit all unhealthy habits all at the same time ( vegetarian diet, no pop, no caffiene etc). And that, I believe has ultimately lead to my many relapses in the past. So this time, for now at least, I am going to give myself grace and medicate with food and caffiene and sugar. I'm always very self conscious of my health and I think sometimes I'm my own worst enemy when I try to be my idea of the prefect human. And that's just it, I'm human and I never will be perfect. Life is short and mental stress can be just as detrimental as being physically unhealthy. 
I just want to be emotionally available to myself and my family. I'm going to go the withdrawals, I'm going to fully embrace feeling like shit and I am going to stuff my face with yummy food and caffinated beverages. 
I may look like Tim the tool man Taylor in that Santa clause movie after all is said and done but at least I'll be happy and all the way off this mental train wreck of a journey that I've hated for so long!",8

Just wanted to vent a bit. The anxiety and ""fog"" by going to zero nicotine is absolutely brutal. I can kinda deal with the fog, but the anxiety stops me in my tracks.

I've been using the patch and successfully went down from 21mg (max dosage) patch to what I am on now: The 14mg patch. I was feeling pretty confident lately so today I decided I was not going to wear the patch at all. Oooh boy.

I don't have any real mental focus. If I try to focus on work I get a slight headache and it passes quickly as soon as I ""unfocus"".

Its the anxiety that led me to vent today. If 100% was a full blown panic attack and 0% was feeling normal, its just a constant 30% level of anxiety. Just enough to begin to alter my behaviors / daily routine, but not out of control.

So I slapped a patch on. Kinda feels like a failure, but I'm rushing the patch process (as compared to the recommended schedule listed on the box). I know that every day I don't smoke is a success, but I'm still frustrated that I'm still enslaved to this addiction. I just want to get to the ""finish line"" and am frustrated that its further away than I had originally hoped.

Good news is I have little desire to smoke. The patches really did help me break the smoking habit, but the nicotine addiction remains. 

I'm gonna rest today. Just relax, play some games, browse reddit. Low stress kinda day to reset. Then I'm gonna try no patch again tomorrow. If I'm met with similar results I'll go buy the 7mg patch and slap that bad boy on for a more gradual reduction.",4

I don't enjoy anything about.
I've been smoking since 14 like most people, and I'm 24 now. In that time I've tried and failed to stop 17 full times. Each time I had a type of motivation, each time (except for the last time because it was too embarrassing) I've made it public, each time I had support, each time I couldn't quit for longer than 3 days. People say it gets easier but it really doesn't for me. I don't even believe myself when I try to quit.
But I need this job. I need this opportunity and I'm not going to allow a bad habit to stop me. I smoke roll-your-own tobacco and I told myself that when this pack of tobacco is done, I'm burning everything relating to smoke (I've also done this before). It's pathetic, I know. But I've seriously exhausted every strategy I could find on the internet. This time will just have to work. I'm at quarter of a pack now (about 12g left) and I'll keep you updated. I have an app that I paid for (another attempt at committing) that I'll use again.",7

I know the wirst two weeks are probably going to be the hardest (especially with Christmas and New Years coming up which usually means stress, lots of food and drinking) but I'm determined to not feel like a mess anymore.

I had lots of trouble falling asleep my first smoke-free night (it finally worked at like 4am) but it just showed me how much I'm physically and mentally addicted to nicotine.

I feel so done with smoking right now. I'm done with being paranoid about getting cancer, my bad acne and dull skin and just the sheer amount of money and time I'm spending on my addiction. 

&#x200B;

For any tips on how to deal with the withdrawal symptoms (I don't want to take nicotine substitutes though) I'd be very thankful!! 

I wish you all happy holidays and stay safe and healthy xx",5

I started smoking at 13 (now I'm 30) just so I can better integrate into groups f people and never stopped since. I had just a couple of periods in which I didn't smoke (1 year with to some medication, when I was 20 or 21 and 2-3 times in which is stopped 1-2 months. Having a cod or the flu didn't stopped my craving or my need to it... it just felt worse when that happened.

Now, I don't know if this post will be allowed or not, but I'm still trying, just so I can get the minimum amount of accountability and dopamine towards doing this. I recently managed to stop for 3 months but due to boredom, stress and loneliness I seemed to have started smoking again, habit  which will produce more of the previously mentioned symptoms.

Now, I know I'm not funny so this request might not be fun for you, but here I am, asking...

What I ask for is something small, yet big at the same time... as it requires effort from your part without any visible effort from my part, and even provide you with cringe, yet... I want to try and see how this motivates me... If 10 people would subscribe to my yt channel, I would stop smoking again... and not only that... I will provide 1 weekly update on how it is going and maybe even videos about how to do it.

Now the reason why I'm doing this in this method is that I want to start things from a point of abundance and not a point of scarcity (and I guess most of you know that the scarcity mindset does not work).

Now I know my channel is mostly NoFap (For Now) but yeah... I am getting motivated to eliminate another bad habit from my life. 

Thank you for reading my description for the channel address, or searched Prophet Moonstruck on yt.",1

-	one that could carry me over cravings, 
-	one that could inject a click feeling 
-	and make me stop out of state, 
-	one that made it really hard to keep my successes once it all seemed to become easy and it dissapeared. 
-	One that magically dissolves everytime I fell in that trap of having another puff:

My awe for the downsides of the addiction, 
my disgust by smoking itself has helped me tons staying away.

However, even if at ratio it is there, there comes the moment where this emotion will stop for certain: sadly we forget. So I want to cultivate it and make it unforgettable. This time and from now on, there‚Äôll be not a single second I‚Äòll forget my repugnance against 

-	smoke, 
-	tar, 
-	dependency, 
-	nicotine, 
-	and some other 4000 appalling things 
-	in a pack of mostly 20 sticks 
-	of thrown out cash 
-	wrapped up in a box of dead trees. 

I won‚Äôt forget the moments in my life, that made me

-	helpless,
-	dispaired, 
-	ashamed, 
-	embarrassed, 
-	weak, 
-	hopeless, 

and who exactly made me feel that way. 
Que sera, sera, and I might have those feelings again. 
But I won‚Äôt give Smoking a chance to be THAT reason. 
It tricked me often enough, and it‚Äôs just enough.
Feel me?

Please help me make a list of those moments. So I can look it up even in years to come and for the unfortunate fact I would fall again remember what it‚Äôs all about. 
Have that list if it helps you too. 

**Here‚Äôs a trigger warning:**
This doesn‚Äôt help some people at all, but makes them more frustrated and smoke more so, don‚Äôt continue Reading, in case thats you. 

But if your over the hill, or stable about it and motivated, if you still smoke and just want to  spill the beans about the f‚Äòd up side of it. Here‚Äôs the place. 
Let‚Äôs make a cheat sheet about all awefull moments, that once clean of smoking we never want to live again. 

I‚Äòll start with one, and add over time, no ranking in intensity. And I‚Äòll edit this to fill up all your moments from the comments in the list too. Let‚Äôs see how many we can get.


1.	checking my handbag and seeing it‚Äôs full of tobacco crumbs, just like my car, my phone, my pockets.
2.	waking up after a major life crisis, having a hard time, slept on the couch and the first thing I see instead of sunlight is as smoky room and a full ashtray 
3.	kissing my love that doesn‚Äôt smoke and be disgusted by the nicotine and tar taste of his skin. Oh, wait. 
4.	 loosing my 5 minutes break at work in which I could relax, hasty running down stairs and another 50m, for what exactly again?
5.	burning my favorite clothes cause I slipped the cigarette out of my hand because of the cold.
6.	freezing. Freezing in January like this is North Pole while every body else is fine.
7.	Timidly asking my non-smoking friends, if it‚Äôs okay I light a cigarette in a restaurant outside, while they still eat. 
8.	Lighting a cigarette at a bus stop not aware of the wind direction, and seeing the smoke pull 3 Meters right over to a 2yrs olds face.
9.	Hiding from my child for 7 minutes. Being a abashed getting back with That smell.
10. scared to enter a train ride, because it‚Äôs gonna be 70minutes, and I could smoke no where. ( ain‚Äòt that crazy)

1.	procrastinating taking a shower for exactly same reason as above (yes, been there)


u/Celedte reminded me of these:

1.	having to sneak out for a smoke in a smokefree work place. being worried customers, co-workers, boss(!!) smelling you. 
2.	having to rush for a morning cigarette, for a ""before work cig"", for a ""before school cig"". ending up late because of it. 
3.	trying to smoke quickly before the bus or train comes. 
4.	putting it in your pocket because you can't afford to throw half smoked cigarette away. having to ask random people for cigarettes. 
5.	smoking accidentally in front of a pregnant woman. 
6.	smoking in front of people who don't want you smoking and feeling ashamed. 
7.	throat and chest hurting, especially when lying down. 
8.	throat hurts and gets full of saliva when running, hard to breathe. 
9.	always having a tickle in your throat. 
10. getting up out of bed to smoke when I should be sleeping. 

1.	always needing a break - even walking the dog was motivated by the cigarette I could have. 
2.	stress and anxiety

which reminded me of:

1.	cutting down my needs to make ends meet the way I‚Äòll have nothing of what would help me stay healthy, but enough to smoke
2.	being sick all winter of every little thing, while my collegues are all at work
3.	saddend, listening to that 16yo girl, that explains me how she tries to explain to her mom why shes no more in the national junior squad of athletics, well cause she couldn‚Äôt run same time, since now she smokes. Wishing I ever had quialified for any national .... okay, well I guess its her life...
4.	this one dad, who passed his 10yo a cigarette at the tram station, in an actual gesture of love. The 10yo gratefully accepting it. 
5.	tasting my own mouth (tar! ) once I didnt smoke 48 hours.
6.	feeling my mouth burn, once I didnt smoke 48h.
7.	walking 200m in suprizing 2h for another pack in the weakest day of my entire life.
8.	getting desperate when the cigarette machine just swallowed all the small change I could find in my pockets at 23:00. Yes, and that repetedly.
9.	seeing my cat run off the balcony once i light the cigarette.
10. feeling embarrased when talking on phone and friends ask about that sound they cannot allocate but hear about every couple minutes. yes, the lighter that is. 

1.	cleaning ashtrays, and always wonder where and how to do it, so I wouldnt have that shit in my kitchen sink.
2.	entering the kitchen next morning, if I ever failed to my resolution to not smoke inside. 



u/zebrashitshow reminds of this moment:

-	I remember all those times when I'd put on shoes, pants, shirt, a coat, gloves, and a beanie, to go walk outside in the pouring rain and stand under a tiny alcove, freezing to death and telling myself that it would be worth it. After getting wet and making myself smell like an ash tray, I'd walk back up to my apartment, completely change my clothes back into my home stuff, and then go sit back down, just to repeat this stupid ritual in another hour.

Just In case you‚Äòd now think vaping would make some of it better, have a read on what u/vape_myass  has to say about it:

https://reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/kkakbz/quit_smoking_but_please_do_not_trade_it_for_vaping/

u/-L-E-N-N-Y- reminded me why ‚Äûjust one more‚Äú is a pretty lame idea:

-	Also if you would smoke rn, you will notice that probably the cravings won't even go away. And it tastes horrific. I've had it a few times that I smoked a cig after a while and it just isn't satisfying. The cravings stay and you will just feel guilt. 
-	Also, the fact that you're thinking about it will trigger cravings. And the more you think about it, the worse the cravings will get. So, just as when you just quit, it will help to put your mind on something else when these thoughts pop up. Mindfulness might help with this as well as for the anxiety.

I was a pack a day smoker for about 5 years, attempted to quit throughout but could never make it more than 12 hours without a cigarette. About a month ago I bought a weed pen, and the following evening let my cigarettes run out without buying another pack.

Every time I had a nicotine craving I smoked some weed instead. The weed didn't eliminate the cravings entirely but made them far more tolerable and go by faster.

I did that for two days and as of today I have been free of nicotine (and weed) for a month! I was kinda worried I was replacing one addiction for another, but thankfully that doesn't seem to be the case (at least for now)

If anyone could help that'd be great please.

I'm in the UK and I smoke about 15 a day.

The 16hr/take off at night patches suitable for my smoking habits are a 25mg dose, but the 24hr (wear when sleeping and awake) patches are 21mg.

Am I being dim or shouldn't the dose be higher if you're wearing the patch for longer?

(note: I'm looking into the brand Nicorette for the 16hr, and the brand Nicotinell for the 24hr)

I also smoke within 10 minutes of waking in the morning, and everywhere seems to recommend a 24hr patch if you smoke soon after waking but the fact it's a 21mg dose is putting me off choosing that one?

If anyone could give me some clarity i'd appreciate it a lot.

Thanks a lot in advance

EDIT: I've just realised that actually the 24hr patch recommend for my smoking habits is actually 15mg...! So even more lower than the 16hr patch. How can this be the case? So confusing! Lol",1

2020-12-19 02:30:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/kg3jba/easier_way/,Easier way.,"Opinions may vary, but I tried for years to quit and always folded. Here is what worked:

Convert to a nicotine-salt based vape. One that is easy to use and small. And strong. You will become more hooked to this bullshit than you ever were to smokes initially but its obviously better than smoking. Juul works as a stop-gap but they are evil and a bad deal. Get one of these little pod-mod things.

Get some of the refillable liquids at varying strength. I am not shilling but the only place I've seen that you can really get taper down strengths it at ""liquidbarn"". Please list better sites below if they exist. Get 50 Ml of 4 different step down strengths.

In desperation, when you start having to jump down in strength, dilute your last drops of the stronger dose with the next step down. This keeps you from ever having to notice the reduction. You will feel ridiculous doing it. That's because you are.

If you make it down to vaping 0% nicotine, you eventually will realize you are an idiot inhaling theater machine fog. Stop and never return.

For the next year, every new stress will make you want nicotine just as before, but as a vape because the thought of smoking is now repulsive. But vaping is also just embarrassing and it isn't worth it.

Worked for me, hope this helps someone.

Some Observations for anyone struggling.

1. Allan Carr's easyway and other resources were helpful, but it also left me believing that cold turkey was the only and best way to quit. It's not. My interpretation held me back. Believing there was a ""best way"" created a mental barrier, and created some of my quitting failures.

2. Nicotine Replacement was helpful for me, but I had to really be committed to quitting before I was ok with how it works.  NRT doesn't have that immediate relief I had when smoking, it takes time. It's subtle.  Also I had side effects. The patch was itchy and made me extremely anxious. The gum made me nauseated. I tried so many things and so many combinations. I experimented until I found something that worked. I use disposable a 3mg nicotine vape, and so far so good.

3. I worked on my behaviors for months. I quit smoking in my car over 3 months ago. Now when I drive I no longer even think about smoking. I used to smoke every single time I drove. The first few weeks were challenging. It's just a non-smoking thing I've been doing. My list of non-smoking things was pretty significant before I actually quit. I cultivated more and more non-smoker behaviors. Even little things like brushing my teeth after eating instead of immediately smoking added up. 

5. I actively worked for months on reducing my total nicotine dependence.  I went from 25ish a day to 8 a day by the time I quit.   

6. My actual quit was so much easier than I expected. So much. I built it up to this unsurmountable, horrible, hell on earth experience. It wasn't. The first day felt like it was 100 hours long. I couldn't concentrate because I was waiting for it to ""get bad."" Day 2 was easier, and each day after easier still.

7. I knew this time was different because I actually hated smoking the last week I was doing it, and I was looking forward to quitting. Four months of wanting to quit, and really working to change my behavior paid off.  Smoking before my previous attempts, I felt like I would miss smoking forever. This time, it was more ""I'm done, pack your bags, gfto.""

This morning I had a strong intense craving after coffee, and I wanted nicotine - for the first time in my memory, I wanted to sooth that feeling with something other than a cigarette. Nicotine is my next battle, and I know I can do it.",290

The coolest part is it's really not a big challenge any more on a day to day basis. Actually it's rare if its a challenge at all at this point. This isn't my first long quit (2 years once) but I am determined to make it my last. Leaving some insights here from my journey this go around.

Lots of great advice on this sub so apologies if this is redundant. 

1) The first couple of weeks are hard. I have always had to give up drinking for at least a week or two to give myself a fighting chance. I change my expectation for myself around productivity, working out, balanced eating, sleep etc and just let myself have a break. But a break without drinking or smoking. Everything else can hold for a bit. 

2) The hardest part for me is maybe month 3 when I'm like ok this feels good, I'm over it but then I see other people smoking and think wow, fuck... I never get to have that again? I feel the yearning even that far out and an anxiety that I will always have this feeling. But it's not true! It just takes a few more months.

3) As time goes on and seasons change there are new associations to break and these things continue to come up. It's snowing now for the first time this year and I'm like wow I would have loved to get bundled up and go watch the snow with a cigarette in the morning. Only takes a few snowfalls to build a new normal and break the association but I find that things like this can pop up for me. 

4) COVID has been stressful for me but was actually a bit of a godsend re smoking. I lost my job, had to relocate to a new state etc. but also the fear of potentially being compromised in the era of a globally surging respiratory virus was enough for me to get my quit started and the complete change in schedule & routine made it easier for me to stick to it. Life may always be kinda stressful and the right time to quit is pretty much always now, so if you can find ways to make the quitting go hand in hand with the stress I think it's advisable. 

Anyways -- thanks to everyone for sharing here. This has helped me a lot. Hope something I wrote might be useful to you. 

P.S. I have been addicted to nicotine for half my 30 years on earth, but never nearly so badly as the one time when I quit cigarettes via the juul. That shit is a trap and I think it should be avoided at all costs -- just my opinion.",6

So, I was drinking, watching football with 2 friends of mine. (all covid protocol followed) I had a smoke. A full one. I enjoyed it. Until about 30 seconds later when I got hot, sweaty and felt sick. I went home, poured myself water and told my wife. I was embarassed and immediately regretful. I felt like shit both physically and mentally all night and woke up in nothing but shame. 

In hind sight, I feel like I did myself a favor. I honestly felt repulsed and disgusted and the physical feeling like I was going to throw up still sticks in my mind, but the dreams are gone. Instead of the solid cravings through the day I remember what that recent time was like and how I felt.

So all in all, I didnt restart my count. Im still very much if not more of a nonsmoker. Pretty sure Ive done this all the wrong way, but its worked. I think with a little bit of certainty after 20+years of smoking. I am actually fucking done with it.",7

I‚Äôve recently quit vaping and nicotine entirely for about six weeks. The bad news is I feel worse than ever. I‚Äôm so irritable (I‚Äôm sure this is the case) but my brain is processing it as every single person I deal with being unbearable, including my lovely girlfriend. I essentially just hate everyone at the moment. I was hoping to feel better by now but I feel worse. I‚Äôm not getting cravings, I just feel like I‚Äôve slid into an angry depressions. 

Last year, about 12 months ago, I was diagnosed by my doctor with anxiety and mild depression. I went in the New Year to CBT on the NHS (UK) which was useless and then went for private hypnotherapy sessions. This changed my life: my perspective, my self worth, everything was better. Then Covid. To be honest, I‚Äôve ridden this storm fairly well considering the year it‚Äôs been. But I actually wanted this to be the final piece of the make-Covid-a-positive-experience puzzle and sorting my health out (I quit drinking entirely about two years ago). Is this a temporary thing that I can see light at the end of or is my brain actually fucked and I require crutches to just function. I‚Äôve never wanted to drink since quitting but everything seems so miserable currently I feel like jacking it all in: I know I won‚Äôt and I don‚Äôt want to smoke/vape either I just want to not hate everyone including myself.

Sorry for the rant but any scientific or anecdotal information to give me some hope might stop me finding a volcano to jump into. Thanks and Merry Christmas.",3

2020-12-17 03:57:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/kety08/two_years_smoke_free/,Two years smoke free!,"Today it has been exactly two years since I stopped smoking, and I thought I would stop by to share my experiences and tips with everyone who just quit.


I remember my quitting experience vividly. On the night of December 16th 2018 - the night before I quit - I was lying in bed, sobbing. I was so scared I was going to fail again, that I wouldn't survive (for whatever reason) and that it would all be horrible.


Well, the first day was horrible. I used patches to help me since I had failed twice before doing it cold turkey. The patches took the edge of, but definitely didn't take away the cravings. I kept myself busy with work, but man I wanted a cigarette so badly. 
On day 3, I broke down. I just couldn't fight myself and the cravings anymore. Or so I thought. I talked to my boyfriend and actually didn't backslide! 


Those first weeks were just not easy. And it didn't help I actually spend Christmas with my family in law, who ALL smoke INSIDE. That meant that after about a week of being smoke free, I was surrounded by smoke. And yes, that was HARD. 


But the cravings became less and less, and they stopped being so  horrible. They mostly came back when I did new things. The first time I had a beer with friends in the summer sun, I wanted to smoke. The first time I was waiting for the train, I wanted to smoke. The first time I was stressed out because a family member got really ill, I wanted to smoke. But I didn't. **Always remember: smoking doesn't help you, it doesn't make things more fun and it doesn't take the stress or fear away. And the more you do things without smoking, the less you think about it.** 


I'm two years smoke free. Are the cravings completely gone? No. I still get them from time to time, but if it's once a month, it's a lot. They pass in about 1-2 minutes and just don't bother me as much anymore. 

**So here are some of my tips:**

* There's nothing wrong with getting help. I used patches and got help from a coach through the phone. It really helped me. But do it **your** way. If that's cold turkey, great! If that's with patches, also great! Whatever works for you.

* The day you quit, immediately change your routines. Did you get up in the morning and immediately smoked a cigarette? Go do something else, like taking a shower. Did you smoke after dinner? Go do the dishes in stead. Most important is that you're not gonna sit around thinking about how you would have had a cigarette now, but just do something else. It's the best way to change a routine.

* Get a fail safe. In my case that was my boyfriend, who I live with. I told him to not let me buy cigarettes, no matter what. And to not give me any (he actually wasn't quitting and still hasn't). He made sure I just couldn't get any those first few days, which really helped me. 

* Every time you have a craving, don't sit around. Go do something. Draw, clean, study, go for a run, read a book, anything. A craving passes in about ten minutes and distracting yourself really helps.

* Before you quit smoking, make plans for what you'll do when you get a craving and write them down. That way, you don't have to brainstorm when you actually get one. You can just pick something off your list.

* Avoid being around other smokers while they smoke for a while. For me, the first week was the hardest. But that is different for everyone, so just see how you feel.

* Remember the times that were hard for you. Write them down, make a video about it, whatever. But make sure that if you even **think** about smoking again, you can look back on how hard it was to quit. Do you really want to go through that again?

* Remember: smoking doesn't solve anything and it doesn't help you. It's easy to give up when you get stressed, scared or sad. But the cigarette doesn't help with those emotions. It doesn't take away the sadness, it doesn't make you less scared and it actually gets you more stressed out. Also: people who don't smoke get through those situations without nicotine just fine, so why can't you?

* Take it one day at the time and remember: **you can do this**. You're doing something great. Keep it up!",22

Oh boy that was a huge fucking blow. At that point I'm thinking I can never quit, I have to be a smoker for the rest of my life and I do not want to. For the next three years I tried nothing but I was still thinking about it. At 21yo I started seriously considering to quit again. But my thought patterns were like - ""This week is gonna be very stressful I need to smoke to deal with it, I'll quit after that"" things like that. Planned ""quitting day"" never comes. Anyways, I tried again. As you would know first few days are the hardest. I felt like shit, I had cravings, I felt depressed, I was angry, I had mood swings. But the different thing this time was that I had so much experience in trying to quit, I recognised all of the above symptoms and consciously attributed them to nicotine leaving my body. I felt shitty but dealing with it was easier. After the first month cravings almost fully went away. A few of them here and there but nothing really worth noting.

So now I have been smoke free since May 6. And you have no fucking idea how easy it gets. I thought quitting was wanting it forever but not smoking it. No sir. I have no cravings at all. Zero. If somebody is smoking near me the smell of it literally chokes me. So my point is that if you snap your streak do not get disheartened, it's natural. Most people do not get it done on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and even 10th try. Hell, it took me probably 30.  Just keep trying to quit. You will do it. You CAN do it. If I can do it, you can too.

This is the quote that helped me a lot during my journey:

""The only reason you are going to light up the next cigarette is to get back to the same state of relaxation that non-smokers enjoy all the time"" - Allen Carr.

I confirm that.

I apologise for any grammatical mistakes, English is not my first language.

I wish good health to you all. Peace.",23

I managed to stop smoking at the begining of the year for a whole two months. Then on my birthday I went out with friends and started smoking again (i don't do well in social settings and smoking is a great excuse to take a break from the crowd).

Now I'm doing so badly. Before stopping smoking, I managed to reduce at around 5 cig a day, but now I'm back to around 8 or 10 a day. 

I stopped smoking during a long weekend, closed myself at home and managed to not touch one single cigarette, keeping me busy with videogames or netflix or even sleep. 

Now, I can't seem to be able to achieve that anymore. Is there any effective and proven method? I am fine with using medications as well if that's going to work.

I've been in a bit of a dilema right now. I REALLY want to quit, like REALLY FUCKING BADLY. I have never been more motivated to quit during my entire life.

However,

I am currently in the middle of my final year at University and I have a metric shit ton of work to do. It has always been a bit of a gripe for me to smoke whilst I'm writing essays. And I really think that if I tried to quit now it would effect the quality of my work, which I just cannot let happen.

I am considering using the patch for the meantime until I can finally quit in May when I've handed in all my assignments.

What I'm calling a ""COVID smoker.""","Hey all, hope this is okay. This is my first time trying to seriously quit. I haven't been smoking long, and in a lot of ways am not as bad as I could be---at most I smoke 5 cigs a day, sometimes I go for just one, sometimes there are single days when I don't smoke---and I've been doing so for maybe about 8 months now. Started, yes, ""because of""/during the early days of the pandemic. I've thought often about stopping, and thrown out a pack, only to buy one the next day. It's not my first rodeo: I've had problems with drinking before, a much longer and harder and more immediately disastrous problem, so I know what I'm like as an addict. I'm not even sure whether I'd say I'm an ""addict"" to cigarettes in particular yet, but the behavior is the same, so I'll go with it.

I used to smoke very occasionally in the past---could have a pack and smoke a cig only when I was drinking, or only in a social occasion, and then just leave the pack untouched for months. I used to be kind of ""famous"" for it, amongst friends---I guess I have to face the fact that that's just not me anymore. If I buy a pack of cigarettes, I smoke them, and I want another after I've had one within at least a few hours. One thing that helped the habit grow for me is that it made ""moderate"" drinking very easy for me, in a way that nothing else did. I haven't had a problem with my drinking in over a year, and that's been an immediate blessing in a way that smoking hasn't really provided problems for me yet.

Yet what's crazy to me is that the pleasure I get from smoking is so small compared to the immense stress it pressures me into. Like, I can at least understand why I used to bingedrink so hard, because I used to get like ""transcendentally distant"" and actually happy for a change. At best smoking relaxes me, and it hasn't even done that recently because I haven't smoked a single cigarette without thinking about how I have to quit, how much of a loser I am, how I have to make sure no one can see me or smell me or what people think of me.

Actually i am not bad at all, the worst is the brain fog sometimes i experience while working but it is like being a bit high so not too bad. 
My problem is thst at the moment i am smoking just sume pure joints with cdb in the evening and its been great so far. During the holidays i will surely see some of my friends and i guess (after showing eachother the negative covid test result) we will also share a couple of joints. Now i dont want to be the one smoking by himself his small pure weed joints obky because there is some tobacco within. How is your experience? Did you just refuse all joints having tobacco inside or since what you look for is the effect, it does not matter so much after the first two weeks when technically you are only mentally addicted to cigarettes? I want to quit smoking but no to quit my lifestyle, which (pre-covid) meant also to randomly accepting joints from friends or friends of friends and so on... How have you coped with this??

I will smoke too when I get older."" Of course, that last sentence was out of character (it was my subconscious more than anything else anyway) but the rest is definitely something she could say. It made me immediately put the cigarette out and promise her I would not smoke again.

2020-12-12 18:58:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/kbzzlb/smoking_and_eating/,Smoking and Eating,"Hello everyone,

I just passed by to share a conversation I had with a friend that got me back to the times I used to smoke and notice things that are no longer part of my life.

Smoking after eating is a thing. However, sometimes the food is so bad that you are eating with the anxiety of going to smoke. In these situations, I don't even think it's a physical dependence that acts on us or anything. 

This is like, ""I want this situation to be over so bad that I want to pass to the next stage of my life that invariably, will be smoking"". Of course we were talking about this from the perspective of the routine side of smoking and it is a logical thing to remind ourselves that it is often that we smoke by routine or to avoid other routines and that that isn't exclusive from smoking.

You can apply it to eating. You eat when you aren't hungry, just because it is routine and you might end up losing the perception of what is really being hungry and what's not in your everyday life. 

Smoking is the same thing. I don't know if every time I wanted to smoke, I really wanted it or was embraced in routine or social conventions. Going back, going for a night out and in a time and place in which you can smoke inside a club, no problems. 

You are drinking and it feels nice to have a cigarette with it BUT, your mouth tastes like music papers and you have already surpassed your ideal dose of cigarettes for the day by another pack. You already spent more money that you should have...

Does it really still make sense? Actually, these were the times that, on the next morning, I mostly felt like quitting. My throat was like burning my day on its own. Just terrible feelings.

Have a nice day guys,

I‚Äôve tried quitting multiple times but I could never do it for longer than 4 days. 3 weeks ago I had to go through a surgery in my throat that would stop me from smoking for a week. That whole week I looked forward to smoking every day. My throat ended up taking longer to heal and eventually it got to the two week mark. The urges were not as strong anymore and I started adapting the most talked about idea on this subreddit: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need it today, but I‚Äôll definitely smoke tomorrow‚Äù, and just as expected so far, tomorrow never came.

As weird as it is to say I‚Äôm extremely grateful for that surgery, but something I think could help people reading is that I could‚Äôve smoked the day after the operation, it just wasn‚Äôt recommended. It helped me stop but I had it in me the whole time, it was just an excuse that helped me finally stop. I think if people start thinking about it that way as a thing they have to do, and that they have no choice other than that or health complications ( which is true ), quitting would be a lot easier. When those health complications start happening most people would say ‚ÄúI wish I‚Äôd never smoked‚Äù or ‚Äúget me out of this and I‚Äôll never smoke again‚Äù. I wish I hadn‚Äôt waited to experience that, and I hope I could help someone realise it without going through it themselves.

For the first time I‚Äôm finally starting to feel good about quitting, slowly realising the importance and satisfaction of control, and the great feeling of knowing I‚Äôm no longer throwing my life away to ash. I hope I can finally kick that shit for good. Thank you to this subreddit for always offering tips and support üôè.

This is going to be a very long one, I hope it can help some people but it will also help me to write everything down. As a preface, and you can look at my post history as proof, I have nothing to do with the pharmaceutical industry or any benefactor thereof, I am an IT guy who has worked in FinTech most of his life so this is for no other reasons than I just stated.

&#x200B;

I posted here a good few weeks ago and I've been meaning to report back to let people know how I got on, I was just starting on Champix at the time (I'm going to call them Champix because they're called Chantix in the US only and that's because the FDA thought Champix sounded too good...) of my last post and had my doubts and anxieties but here I am, 22 days since my quit date and I'm happy to report that I'm now a non-smoker! I have the odd craving, nothing over the top and nothing I haven't been able to handle so far. But I will be stopping Champix in 5 days and I might be back here for help then :) I don't believe Champix help stop the craving once you are over the normal withdrawal and habit changing phase though, it's how it stops your brain from getting any benefit from smoking a cigarette that eventually removes the association between smoking and rewards from your brain and breaks that circuit so I do actually believe once I stop taking Champix nothing much will change, at least nothing negative. One of the best selling points for me is that due to how Champix works, you go through nicotine withdrawal in the first few days of smoking without really realising it all the while smoking even more than normal due to the anxiety of stopping smoking. So by the time you stop smoking your only problem then is the habit of smoking a cigarette itself.

&#x200B;

I will admit, I did smoke a total of about 5 cigarettes over the last 22 days, the last being more than 7 days ago, all of them after alcohol and all only about 1/6th of the cigarette each time before throwing it away and that was thanks to Champix for sure. I'll get into that in detail below, but I stopped drinking 7 days ago because I realise, at least right now, whenever I have a drink I want a smoke, I wouldn't call it a craving but I want a smoke, and right now I do not want to want to smoke so I am choosing not to drink to remove that feeling!

&#x200B;

To start, I'm a 36-year-old recovering alcoholic who still drinks a few cans of beer from time to time (read: 2-6 cans a few days a week) and have smoked 20 cigarettes minimum per day for just over 20 years, for that entire time if I didn't have a box of cigarettes I would be freaking out until I could get one. I was one of those people who did not want to smoke for all the reasons everybody else who actually doesn't want to smoke has, but thought I would be a smoker for life. I just couldn't imagine being able to actually not smoke, I did not think it was possible. I have no psychological problems otherwise, I had major anxiety in my early 20s that I haven't had since about the age of 26 other than hangover related 'fear' but that's not a disorder, in reality, that's self-inflicted. But I would say in general I am in overall good psychological and *not bad* physical shape. I won't run up many stairs but I can do anything without getting out of breath and I have no difficulty doing anything. This is all just a prelude to my experience with Champix and my journey to becoming a non-smoker.

&#x200B;

So for the last few years, I've really wanted to stop smoking but never had the courage, I tried once I think around a year ago and lasted an awful 2 days before I had to dash to the store trembling to get a box and smoked that first cigarette like it was made of gold. I never particularly enjoyed smoking - or at least I thought I didn't - but when I tried to stop I realised I must have actually enjoyed *something* about it or I wouldn't have smoked anyway! Then at the start of this year, just after the COVID lockdown in China lifted, I was diagnosed with mild emphysema from a random chest CT for something unrelated, no symptoms whatsoever and a lung function test of 100%. That started the ball rolling with the ""*I need to stop smoking, now!*"" in the front of my mind first but I managed to subdue it for a few months while I thought about stopping on and off but perished at the actual thought of physically doing it, my brain subconsciously telling me I needed to smoke for it to get its nicotine hits.

&#x200B;

During the lung function test, the pulmonologist had mentioned that there are pills available to help. I had known about Champix before, I think I might have even tried them a decade or so ago, but the seed was planted. I read a little bit about how they worked and what they do is quite amazing, they act as an inhibitor in the brain so that your brain physically cannot take in any of that nicotine. Doesn't matter what you do, you could probably inject nicotine directly into your head and still it wouldn't do anything. For me that was quite a selling point, I could take the pills AND smoke to get over the anxiety of stopping smoking! Fantastic!

&#x200B;

A couple of weeks later I went to see the pulmonologist again and said I'm ready to give those pills a try so let's do it. He gave me no instructions whatsoever and told me which pharmacy sold them close to the hospital... the pharmacist simply asked if I'd taken them before to which I said no so she had to explain how you start on half a dose once per day for 3 days, then half a dose twice per day for 3 days before reaching the full dose twice per day and that was that, sent on my way with a month worth of pills and an inlay leaflet completely in Chinese of which I do not speak nor read any.

&#x200B;

I sat on them for a few days thinking the day I start taking them is the day I stop smoking so I kept finding excuses not to start taking them but *then* I did some research online and read the information the doctor should have given me which is that it's recommended to start taking them and only stop smoking between day 7 and 10 of the treatment. That put my mind completely at ease because I could smoke as much as I wanted and had nothing to lose, so I said that's it, next Monday is the day. When Monday morning came around I took my first pill and waited for the side effects that everyone online guaranteed will arrive and... well... they sure did!

&#x200B;

Now let me preface this by saying, while the side effects might not exactly be mild, they far outweigh being a smoker by a million, billion lightyears so I do not want to discourage anyone, I just want to be informative and this is all 100% personal and your mileage may vary considerably.

So day #1 the first side effect for me was the nausea, not quite bad enough to think I wanted to vomit and it didn't affect my appetite or ability to eat but my stomach just didn't feel right. This didn't stop until the next morning and this continued for weeks into my treatment. One thing I did find which helped substantially was waiting until after my first large meal of the day, usually lunch, before taking my first pill and taking my second after my dinner and both with a full glass of water, it made the nausea less severe but didn't alleviate it completely. As someone who has taken a lot of recreational drugs in his youth and SSRIs (antidepressants) in their 20s I can say for certain the nausea is 100% not being caused by a physical interaction with my actual stomach, it's whatever it's doing to my mind having a causal effect on my stomach so the eating part is probably a complete placebo but placebo or not, it worked. This went away after a week or two of taking them, I still got the odd stomach cramp or belly discomfort from time to time but thankfully the nausea itself went away. I actually used to look forward to the first couple of hours every day before that first pill so I wouldn't feel the nausea. Not really because it was that bad but it was that constant and annoying.

&#x200B;

Then came night #1... and holy fucking shit is that a trip and a half to say the least. The dreams, or more aptly, the phenomena that happen when you sleep while you start taking Champix is simply indescribable. It can't be called dreaming. A friend was keeping in close contact with me the entire time because he wanted to get onto Champix too and when he eventually did lately, he only did one night and won't take them again because of the night time experience - because there isn't a way to describe exactly how intense the experience is in words. I had and still have vivid dreams for the entire time I've been on Champix **but** vividity is fine and actually quite enjoyable for the most part. What happens in the first week though is a completely different kettle of fish altogether.

&#x200B;

I'll try to put it into words...

You have the vivid dream; but coupled with that are insanely, insanely intense emotions, such a highly emotional state that I would never even reach with recreational drugs, attached to mundane activities that neither in a waking nor dreaming state would elicit the slightest of reactions on a normal day. The biggest issue is you hold onto that emotional state when you wake up. That first week or so I used to wake up and would have to sit down whilst having a smoke, and really smoking the shit out of that smoke, and piece my mind back together for 10 to 15 minutes because of what had transpired during the previous night. It doesn't help that because of the emotions and vividity of the dreams it feels like you haven't really slept either when trying to deal with what just happened.

&#x200B;

I'll give you one example, I have many, but one, in particular, I think highlights how strange it is. One of the first nights I dreamt that I lost my mobile phone pretty early on in the night/dream, now normally I really couldn't care less about that, sure it's a few quid wasted but I can just buy a new one and restore from a backup and I've lost nothing, but in this dream the loss of my phone was devastating, it felt way more emotionally devastating both during the dream and when I woke up than if someone close to me had passed away. As the *dream* progressed I ended up living in a wooden box with no windows in the middle of a city with random different friends for various reasons I don't even remember; but still at this point in the dream, at the bottom of life's barrel, the only thing I could think of and which was still crushing me emotionally whilst I slept was that I had lost my mobile fucking phone... When I woke up that awful, dreadful feeling was still there, like I hadn't woken up and just changed locations.

&#x200B;

Thankfully this too only lasts a week to 10 days. The vivid dreams actually become quite fun, you can wake up and be quite happy that you've just spent the night chilling out with friends you haven't seen for a long time for example, really just having a normal day with random people you haven't seen in years for the whole dream. I've woken up on more than one occasion and been surprised to find out which country I'm actually in because the dream felt so real the previous night but the emotions simply weren't there anymore like at the start, they were just dreams.

&#x200B;

Now, the side effect I feel which causes the most trouble for most people and which I feel is what caused the original ""black label"" on the packaging in the US was the *weird* feeling from time to time, like things just weren't right, a feeling of being shaken to the core out of nowhere. Not anxiety or worry, just really *weird*. It's hard for me to describe because I've never had this experience or emotion before.

&#x200B;

I had come prepared for this though! I had read a lot of personal experiences online and people who stopped taking them because they started to feel the world wasn't right and they need not be in it and all kinds of strange things. So anytime I started to feel *weird*, I would ground myself and take a moment to remind myself, Jay, you are taking a very strong psychoactive substance which is going to benefit you in the long term, try to deal with it, do some breathing, walk to the bathroom and pour some water over my wrists or just sit back and breath. This worked, those feelings only came very infrequently and went away completely after a week to 10 days. But this is where I would advise anybody who is even slightly not 100% mentally healthy, or having any mental health issues at all, if you feel these feelings and they start to become or look like they might become overwhelming, stop taking your medication and see your doctor or, in the worst-case scenario seek medical help immediately. Continue to remind yourself you are taking a very strong drug and everything will be fine. I think this feeling can be managed once one is aware of it's existence and is prepared for it.

&#x200B;

The only other side effect worth mentioning was some days I would start to feel really fatigued an hour or two after the second pill and wouldn't be in the mood to do much but melt into the couch but that is easy dealt with!

&#x200B;

That was it for the side effects mostly, my mood and was fine which was one I was expecting to hit hard and didn't, and otherwise, Champix really did a commendable job at helping me stop smoking. They recommend that you set a quit date 7 to 10 days after commencing the pills which I did, day 10, but as the day drew closer I became less sure of myself and I lasted a couple of hours before having a cigarette but one thing I noticed that was different from any other time was that this time it just felt like I was making a choice to have that smoke and not that I was shaken to my core if I didn't smoke it. So I set another quit date or two and lasted a bit longer both times, until 4 pm I think was the third time. But the beautiful thing about Champix is you can literally pump cigarettes into you and while you're smoking the cigarette you don't *really* feel that it's doing any less for you than normal, you taste the smoke you experience the heaviness of it hitting your lungs but the hidden nicotine hit your brain gets isn't happening. You know when you don't smoke for a day and then you have that first one and you get that rush? Yeah, that doesn't happen! You're just smoking a dirty cigarette and nothing more.

&#x200B;

So I actually started to want to smoke less and started to naturally smoke less and less as days passed, by working out my quit date and how long I've been on the tablets I think it was about day 14 that I said to myself look, let's just try and make the decision *not* to have that smoke today and see if I can last the day and it worked, I made it to the end of the day and I didn't crave a cigarette because Champix had already broken the craving my brain would be usually crying out with so I went into day #2, and then #3 all feeling less and less like having a smoke instead of more because I realised I was *actually* doing it! Now, I won't say I wasn't tempted to smoke, I was, my mind tried playing all kinds of tricks on me. Our minds can be the most deceitful creatures on the planet to our own selves when it wants something and boy was mine doing a number. I caught myself one time telling myself I actually liked smoking, another that it wasn't actually that bad (!!!!!!!!), and another that I must have smoked for all those years for a reason I just must not remember it. But I persevered and it got easier and easier as the days went on.

&#x200B;

I was drinkin cans a few days per week and noticed anytime I had even a whiff of booze I really wanted a cigarette and most of the time I managed to avoid having that cigarette and going to bed - but a total of 5 nights I did actually have one cigarette before bed and was lying to myself calling it a reward for making it through the day without smoking. So the last cigarette I smoked I said to myself, Jay, you're lying to yourself, your own mind is lying to you to try and get that nicotine it's loved for so long but it's not even getting it so it's even lying to itself so to prevent myself from wanting that *rewarding* cigarette I decided not to drink anything at all, at least for 6 months, I can make a decision then if I want to drink again but for now, as I said above, if I have a drink it makes me want to have a smoke and I do not want to want to have a smoke so if I remove the cause. I have to say though, this phase was only possible for me to succeed at because of Champix, I never got the reward my brain thought it was going to get those nights so I could think properly and clearly about it the next morning instead of only focussing on the next *reward*.

&#x200B;

7 days after my last drink and I haven't had that feeling of wanting a cigarette since, I have had a couple of not-so-serious cravings for a cigarette but I just find something to take my mind off it, today I even read the advice of taking 15 minutes and just silently naming everything I could see around me and got bored about 2 minutes in but the craving was gone. I used to smoke first thing in the morning, the second I'd dragged my tired-upon-waking self out of bed but now I literally smile at the vivid dream I've just had and literally jump out of bed and think about what nice things I can eat for breakfast. One thing I will say is that my appetite from both drinking and smoking was shot to shit for years, with both I had none at all, with just smoking I'd know I needed and wanted to eat something but the act of eating was simply because I had to, now I actually LOVE a good meal, I love preparing it, I love eating it, I love talking to my wife AFTER the meal without so much as thinking about cigarettes when previously I would have gotten straight up and outside for a smoke before she'd even finished eating.

&#x200B;

A lot of people told me not to keep cigarettes around, but I heard a story a couple of decades ago that's always stuck with me and it's proving to work for me; about a guy who always carried a box of cigarettes around and hadn't smoked in decades. Also, at the height of my alcoholism if I ran out of drink and wanted more I would walk to the nearest 24 hour in hail, sleet or snow and get alcohol at 4/5 am no problem. So I know from personal experience distance is not a hurdle for me. If I decide to have a smoke having to walk to the store and buy them is definitely not going to stop me. Where I currently live I can get alcohol and cigarettes delivered to my door within 15 minutes 24 hours per day too so it's just not a barrier I can trust. So, the box of the last cigarette I smoked still has 19 in it, and it sits beside my car keys beside the front door where it would usually have sat. And every time I see it, it reminds me of how easy it is to choose not to smoke. It's been there for weeks now untouched so in my mind I know I can continue not to touch it. One day I almost accidentally picked it up out of pure habit but instead of getting an instant craving, I had a little giggle to myself and just walked out the door.

&#x200B;

Today while celebrating three weeks smoke-free my wife and I went for dinner in a beautiful Spanish tapas bar and, for the first time, the thought of sitting outside to eat didn't even cross my mind. It wasn't until a little while after we had finished our meal and we were both relaxing trying to digest that I noticed the poor guy sitting outside with his jacket on ordering food while smoking, with his poor wife having to endure the December temperature with him due to his affliction. It was only then that I noticed all the other people outside, with their ball and chain around their ankle in different positions all around the courtyard outside puffing on their cancerous weed and I felt pity, pity that I was free and they weren't, pity that I could choose where to eat, where to go, what to do, what time to do it, and never have to consider if I can smoke, where can I get smokes if I run out, what time is the latest I can get a box if I run out etc if you're here you know that list, we've all had the same list of things we needed to make sure of before doing anything to make sure we didn't have to endure the hell of nicotine withdrawal.

&#x200B;

So, day 22 is almost to a close, day 23 is tomorrow and 24 the day after that and I have no intention of ever having as much of a single puff of a cigarette again for the duration of my hopefully long life. I guess I wrote this to be cathartic and get it all in one place and maybe, just maybe, it might help at least one other person to join us, the non-smokers, and enjoy having one less worry in the world.

&#x200B;

I feel like theres a big huge hole inside of me, and I've been thinking about coping the depression with my recently bought vape (pure ganja vape), but I dont know if that would make it worse by simply replacing the extra dopamine from nicotine with the happy feelings from vaping ganja.

Is it a possible fix or should i hold off on that until i have fully recovered?

Yes, you are quitting smoking. Fine. You didn‚Äôt find the cure for cancer, you didn‚Äôt just write the most inspiring novel of all time. 

Stick to the importance that this really has in your life and especially, in the life of others. Stop making a drama of your cravings to everybody and stop extrapolating that anger that, in fact, you can control.

Your brain is a powerful machine. It will always give you the seeds for you to plant excuses in your life to go back to the same habits.

I'm 38 and have been smoking since I was 15. I've only ever quit when I was pregnant, although not fully, and that was 13 years ago. I just haven't wanted to. At all. 
Something has changed in the past few days. Maybe it's the money, maybe I'm really feeling the effects, but I think I'm doing it now. I'm mildly terrified. 
This is my first morning waking up and having coffee without chain smoking 4-6 cigarettes. 
I've got some 6mg ZYN pouches that are working better than I thought they would. It's still all I'm thinking about, but I'm not going crazy. So far. 

I'd love all of the tips and encouragement you've got. I've been reading a lot of threads in this group about people quitting that have smoked longer than I've been alive and it's SO inspiring. 

I should add that I've quit heroin, methadone, methamphetamine and everything in between cold turkey (3.5 years ago). I can do this, right? 

Also, do I need to use content warnings here?

One trick I have found helpful is exercising. Running is a good trick. If you start running, you will soon realise how much weaker your lungs have become. Day by day, the craving for smoking decreases when your run. Any kind of intense activities help. 
Also, lifting weights in the gym and taking a steam bath also helps a lot. Bear in mind your body does not remove nicotine through sweating in sauna. But what I have found out that, hot weather makes you crave less cigarettes. It might be a psychological thing but it helps.",6

I could really use some advice. I‚Äôve tried quitting atleast over 10 times, but consistently fail within the first 2 days.

I‚Äôve started smoking (regularly) since I was 12. I‚Äôm turning 23 in a couple months.

As I‚Äôm writing this now, I failed another attempt at quitting. With the whole virus going on, being jobless due to that and living abroad in a country where I don‚Äôt speak the language good enough, as well as recently graduated, I spend alot of time at home. Boredom gets to me quickly. I‚Äôve tried battling the ‚Äúboredom smoke breaks‚Äù with using nicotine gum. It helps a bit atleast.
But what gets to me every time within the first 2 days is my anger.

I first feel so conflicted, then the anger hits. My blood starts boiling and I feel myself losing my shit. The blood coursing through my veins and behind my eyes and I just turn into a rage. I try not to give in at first but end up hitting the door, whether with my fist or head, whatever comes first. I can‚Äôt stop it and after an hour or so of feeling like murdering someone I give in.

In those moments, even taking a nicotine gum does not help, and I just am unsure how to battle it. It also does not go away, not like some ‚Äúsurge of anger‚Äù. The longest battle I had with the anger lasted 3 hours before giving in, and it happened during the afternoon of the 2nd day of quitting. 

As I‚Äôm looking to move back to my own country soon, and want to educate myself further, I try to keep myself busy with online studies. Paid and unpaid. But during the anger episode i just can‚Äôt concentrate.
Other options have been fitness or food. It works decently. But shortly after a workout, it just straight up comes back and even more intense as before.

I‚Äôm not sure if anyone else experiences these super heavy angry episodes or if others just are easily annoyed, but any advice on this particular issue would be much appreciated.",2

I got addicted really bad, I would kill a bar every 4 days. Then gradually it became one puff bar a day, and that shit was 50mg a bar. My breathing got so bad, and i stopped vaping then tried Zyn.

Zyn was as bad as vaping because each pouch had a shit ton of dose, and I would kill a pack a day.

For myself, the problem actually hits me about half way through a cigarette! 

I used nicotine very sparingly since late in highschool. In my 20s I would occasionally smoke 2/3 cigs a day, but never consistently- never felt any withdrawals.

Just recently, it‚Äôs become half a pack a day. The last year I would smoke a pack or so a day in spurts, usually half a week and be done for months without noticing a thing.

But now I‚Äôve finally made it a true habit. The oddest part is, I feel depressed, and so I go to smoke. Halfway through, I feel so lethargic and depressed it takes me roughly an hour to recover. And, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not a mental thing because I don‚Äôt feel guilty and have it in my head that it‚Äôs relieving and enjoyable.

E cigarettes, like juul did this too, but I still found it addictive! 

Anyways I‚Äôm quitting, I‚Äôve spooked myself when I finally realized it was a ritual. I never cared about my last cig- a week or two ago, I was out, and not able to pick anything up and I was willing to smoke a butt, rummaging around. Hopefully I‚Äôve not gone too deep that I notice things long term. But I recon it‚Äôs better than ever of a time to address.

I'm now 49 and going on day 3 without a cigarette. Story ...,"First of all fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck. This shit sucks. I've tried multiple times over the years. Tried acupuncture, hypnosis, gum, cold turkey and always relapse. Not going to lie - I love smoking. It's like meat and potatoes. But I'm also looking at 50 years old and we're in the midst of a respiratory pandemic, so that motivated me more than anything else ever has.

I was a pack, pack and a half day smoker, so I started with a stage 2 nicotine patch and dropped about $150 on a pretty nice vape with the absolute LOWEST amount of nicotine. Cold turkey is, as they say, the best method, but I work in a pretty stressful job where I have to interact with clients all day, so breaking down and screaming at them in a full on psychotic withdrawal meltdown is not an option. Both supplements have taken the edge of for sure, but honestly after 37 years of smoking it's still pretty grueling. And I only hit the vape when things get really dicey, and I wait a good chunk of the morning before I apply the patch. Every morning with coffee and no cigarette is pretty awful.

Things that I have noticed that have helped (and I'm sure the most of you already know) are:

STAY. FUCKING. BUSY. Seriously, just do something other than staying idle. My job is very engaging so that helps, and therefore I put even more attention toward it. 

Take massive deep breaths. I've found that when I have an absolutely awful craving to stand up and take as deep a breath as humanly possibly. And when you think you can't take anymore try to take more. Maybe it's me, but it seems to ""trick"" the lungs and mind into thinking you just took a drag.

Text a friend ""I haven't had a cigarette in X number of days!"" Guarantee they are going to reply with positive reinforcement and that shit helps a lot.

All other tips and tricks are greatly welcome. And keep fighting the fight! Fingers crossed ya'll.

Nothing particularly stressful about yesterday. Just a normal day through and through. But man, I had 3 really bad cravings. You know the cravings that are intense AND come back-to-back?

Like, ""REALLY?! I *just* finished resisting you and you give me a 10 minute breather before coming right back!?"" Three separate ""sessions"" like that yesterday. Bastard...lol

I almost cracked on one (the heavy craving I usually have after lunch). But I knew. I knew for a fact what smoking ""just that one"" would lead me. I've been down that road before. I know that road so well  from my previous quit attempts that I can walk that road blindfolded. 

So today is my day 5. I didn't smoke. Because just like I know where the road of ""just one more"" will lead me, I also know where the road of ""resist the craving"" leads me.

Every time I resist a craving, severe or mild, I reinforce the synapses that lead me towards a nicotine-free life and I diminish the synapses that enslaved me to nicotine. Every single time I fight there is a marginal improvement. Even if I don't feel it, I know its happening. Its a gradual process.",8

No time for cravings when you're thinking about having to pee all the time.  Having healthy snacks ready to go at all times. I think I've eaten my bodyweight in carrots and celery with dill dip in the past 30 days.  Started exercising quite a bit too.  That really helped push through the really tough parts. Last, but not least, I relied heavily on melatonin.  Any other time I've tried to quit, I would go days without being able to fall asleep.

To celebrate the 1 month mark and in the hope that it might help others who are starting out, I‚Äôm going to ramble on a bit... 

What I failed to get in the previous attempts is why it was easy to stop smoking during the pregnancies. I assumed it was the motivation of not wanting to harm the baby plus the sickness and sure enough I quickly got back to smoking ‚Äûjust the odd one‚Äú afterwards which obviously turned into an every day smoking addiction within a few weeks. 

Then at day three of this quit I finally got it. It was a Monday, I was back at the office with my smoking colleague, which would have been the perfect excuse to quit the quit yet again. However, I had an appointment at the dentist that afternoon and had a good talking to myself in the morning that I will definitely not smoke before going there. When I went to bed that night I realized with confusion how easy that day 3 was (normally the hardest for me) and I finally understood. I didn‚Äôt question my decision to not smoke that day! I didn‚Äôt fight with the cravings all day. I settled the issue in the morning and that was that. And that was also why I didn‚Äôt struggle during pregnancy! I‚Äôm so grateful for this realization and just so happy to be no longer a smoker and free at last :) 

So to all of you starting out or well into your quits: never question your decision to not smoke! Give yourself the promise in the morning to not smoke today and celebrate your smoke free self in the evening :)",49

2020-12-10 00:34:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/ka9huz/new_here_introduction/,New here - introduction,"[Cross post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopvaping/comments/ka97wi/its_so_quiet_here_an_introduction/) that I originally put on r/stopvaping, where it is eerily quiet. I didn't realize that vaping was fair-game on r/stopsmoking too - it looks like it is anyway. 

Vaping has become basically an all-day event since I started working from home earlier this year. It's expensive and annoying. Don't get me wrong - the past couple years have been awesome since I quit a 20 year smoking habit. I just want to be done with vaping too.

Quitting vaping isn't easy for me. I've been working on doing it less (not very effectively) and reducing the nicotine concentration (hence vaping more often), and just started on a nicotine patch today. The first hours of the day were tough, because the nicotine takes a while to soak in. I was really irritable and anxious... some of that subsided by end-of-day, thankfully. Overall, it feels a lot like my many smoking attempts from years ago - maybe even more difficult. I'm doing some other stuff to help too: some behavioral modification, different diet / supplements, exercising when I can - the typical quit-smoking toolbox. I'm also on day 154 over at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), so it's a lot of the same coping strategies that I'm already using there. Posting on Reddit helps for sure.

So onward and upward from Day 1 I suppose. I might f\*uck up and start over more than once. That's part of the quitting process. I just felt like I needed to throw all that into the void in case anyone needs to hear it. I dunno when I'll post again, because I'm not super active on Reddit other than when I'm venting about addiction. But I'll poke around in some comment sections for a bit and respond when I can. Best of luck to you all - quitting vaping is difficult but worthwhile!

Smoking didn't fit into the future I envisioned for myself. The first few weeks were extremely difficult due to a lot of personal challenges happening at once. I chewed some nicotine gum during that period to help me out. I've also read the first few chapters of Allen Carr's book, as well as The Power of Habit, and I think that really helped put my cravings into perspective. Plus I've been through years of therapy. Being self-aware of triggers and stress and anxiety has become a way of life for me.

Since that 2 week period, the cravings are practically gone. I had a few urges, like when I got rejected for a job, but that's it. It's like I never smoked to begin with. It's become a domino effect with other aspects of my health. I'm drinking more water, washing my face every day, eating healthier (save for the first two months when I was ravenous and eating everything), exercising a little bit each day. I'm even flossing regularly!

I also found out today that I got hired for a new job after spending these several months unemployed. I can finally feel things turning around for me after this awful year.

1. People don't celebrate anniversaries of when they started smoking, but they do celebrate anniversaries of when they quit.
2. No non-smokers or former smokers say they wish they could start smoking or go back to smoking, but you do hear lots of smokers say they wish they could quit.
3. When it comes to dating, no one will be turned on solely by the fact that you smoke, but plenty of people will be turned OFF because you smoke. Even if they do smoke or don't and just don't mind it, that still doesn't help anything other than the fact they just won't find your smoking a dealbreaker. This might sound redundant but I've never met a woman who smokes or someone in general that says things like ""you should go out with me if you smoke"" or ""looking for a fellow smoker""
4. When you smoke, you realize how expensive they are and how much stressful it is for you to spend your money on them. When you don't quit, you realize how much money you save.

I wanted to get out the thoughts / actions I had as I gave in. Maybe someone out there can relate? 

Near the end of my class, the craving hit. ‚ÄúI want to relax and smoke in my usual spot I go to before studying.‚Äù But I told myself ‚Äúno‚Äù and chewed nicotine gum. I visualized sitting and chewing the gum instead, in the same spot I used to smoke. It didn‚Äôt work. I thought: ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong with me? I‚Äôve quit so long. I don‚Äôt want to let down myself or let down my accountability buddy.‚Äù But the craving didn‚Äôt go away. Something in me ‚Äúswitched‚Äù by the end of class, knowing I would get the pack. 

I watched myself walk to the store. ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt the craving passing? I thought it passed quickly, but it‚Äôs not passing.‚Äù I kept watching myself walk. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still not too late. Maybe you can buy more nicotine gum or just go straight to the cafe.‚Äù Didn‚Äôt work. 

‚ÄúMaybe you can visualize nasty lungs.‚Äù Didn‚Äôt work. 

‚ÄúYou know it won‚Äôt taste good.‚Äù Didn‚Äôt work. 

Saw a smoker. ‚ÄúYIPPEE....?‚Äù [from Alan Carr‚Äôs Easyway]. Shit, that didn‚Äôt work either. 

I watched myself walk into the store. I then watched myself walk to the counter, and watched myself purchase a lighter and a pack. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still not too late.. but I‚Äôve already bought it.‚Äù

I watched myself walk to my spot. I knew I was a goner. I knew I‚Äôd been a goner since that moment in class when my brain ‚Äúswitched.‚Äù I sat down and smoked one. Indeed, compared to the freshness of my nicotine gum, it didn‚Äôt taste good. I relaxed on my phone. Lit another. Smoked half before I got tired of it. 

‚ÄúOh well,‚Äù I thought. ‚ÄúBut... NEVER stop quitting! I can still quit! I can do it!‚Äù I took the pack, walked to a different convenience store, and threw it away. ‚ÄúDang, what a waste of money. Now I‚Äôll have to take money back from the smoke-free savings I was starting.‚Äù

I started walking to the cafe. ‚ÄúYou know what? XYZ dollars isn‚Äôt very significant.‚Äù I thought. ‚ÄúAnd health effects are too abstract. So here‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do. EVERY TIME I smoke like that again, I‚Äôm going to move $30 into the money I use to pay off credit cards. I won‚Äôt be able to spend it freely. I‚Äôll charge myself.‚Äù

I felt better as I walked to the cafe. ‚ÄúNever stop quitting.‚Äù As a reward for tossing it, I bought myself an apple latte, even though I usually avoid coffee and sugar, because that shit tastes like Christmas. ‚ÄúMaybe I can cut out the veggie cup too?.... ok, no, you still have to eat that. But you can have the latte.‚Äù

So my action plan is: every time I smoke again, charge myself $30. I think that will be too expensive to justify, especially because I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll smoke a whole pack again.

We can do this. üôÇ never stop quitting",2

I‚Äôve tried two. Have one installed at the moment. And I have had access to two more from friends that, at some point, decided to quit. 

In general, they are pretty much the same. I don‚Äôt think they are very accurate when they send you alerts saying you are better on this or that, like nicotine dependence or taste and smell but they have some features that you can find useful. Knowing how much money you saved is motivating, as I talked about before and it‚Äôs impressive to realize how many cigarettes you would have smoked if you hadn‚Äôt quit. My balance at the moment, 674.

The thing is, apps won‚Äôt make you stop smoking, some of them have silly games that can distract you for a while, nothing more than that. But if you find that some features give you an extra push, go for it.

I was never a pack a day smoker unless I was at an all day music fest that was outdoors. Illinois also implemented a public smoking ban statewide in 2008. At first I was bummed because I turned 18 just a week after the ban went into effect, but as I got older, I was ok with it. Not just out of respect and courtesy of others, but I noticed that if you have to go outside to smoke, especially in the winter, then you're more likely to smoke less. And that's a good thing. 

The cost of cigarettes also made me decrease my usage. They are $14-17 a pack in the city and about $8 in the suburbs. I've also never bought cartons (not even 1) because I figured it'd make me more addicted as I'd have more packs on hand. 

Here's the thing though. Even though the high price of cigarettes would make me buy less packs, I would get still desperate to have one or a few  each day whether I'd go up to the guy selling loose newports or I would go up to strangers that were smoking outside bars or in smoking sections to see if I could buy a smoke off someone for a dollar. 

For the most part, people would be cool they'd either take me up on the offer, tell me to keep my dollar and give me one, or just politely say they're running low and that's ok. The ones who were rude were RUDE. They'd angrily say no. And I wasn't entitled to anyone's cigarettes by any means, but that was uncalled for. It's like I'm not gonna get offended if you wanna save your cigarettes. But I would keep doing it until I found someone to sell me one, and sometimes that'd be 5-10 people and in the cold no less. Felt like I was selling my soul for a cigarette for only 5 minutes of satisfaction. I would bum off my friends too frequently. 

I have had some friends that were legit social smokers and only had one like once or twice a month. But for me, I was bumming  off someone at least once a week.

Now that I have quit, it feels very liberating to not do that anymore. I told myself I wasn't that addicted but that's part of what addiction is. Feeling like you can't do something until you have a smoke.",11

I know everyone is different. But is there a general timeline when it comes to physical benefits? The only difference up to now is not to smell like an ashtray plus teeth starting to get whiter and breathing a bit more easily.

My biggest motivation to quit smoking, however, was my low energy levels, and especially waking up really tired every morning.

I quit smoking cigarettes and replaced them with dokha (pipe tobacco) thinking that would be easier to quit down the line... it wasnt. I managed to stay relatively healthy through high school and college by being super active and at least tried out for every sport team available. However, after graduating I stagnated and the health impacts starting popping up in quick succession. I tried quitting once before and it truly felt like I had lost a friend. People who thought they were helping would tell me that the addiction sticks for life... that really made me want to quit less.

Last month I got engaged and it got me thinking about my future family. I couldn't bare the thought of having them go through the experience of me dying slowly in front of them. Not being able to play with my kids. What was more immediate is that I never told my siblings or parents that I smoked which made me avoid spending too much time with them. That made me feel real crappy.

In any case, at the end of a busy day in late October, I realized I had not smoked all day and it never even crossed my mind. This was unusual as I was a heavy smoker. This, along with the thoughts in the previous paragraph made me decide to quit. I didnt tell my fiance or any of my close friends at first. I didnt want to disappoint them if I failed.

Two weeks in (once I felt far more confident) I brought my fiance over and broke the pipe and told her that I had quit. Though she never pressured me to quit or made a big deal out of it, the happiness in her eyes gave me a massive boost of motivation. I have not smoked since November 3rd 2020 and intend on keeping it that way. That depressing feeling was absent this time around, thankfully. When I would get that feeling like I wanted a smoke, I took fast, deep breaths which gave me enough leeway to find something to busy myself.

I was ""thinking"" of quitting for years... every attempt was a failure until it wasnt. Keep trying. Dont beat yourself up if you dont succeed at first.

Immediate things i noticed were that I was sleeping better, less fatigued throughout the day and my mouth feels fresher when I wake up. I recently started feeling like my breaths were deeper but not by too much quite yet.",180

So I‚Äôve currently not had a cig or any nicotine for 4 weeks. As much as I enjoy having my taste buds back, I have noticed a significant increase in anxiety and brain fog over the last week. 

It‚Äôs really hard to describe the feeling but everyday it‚Äôs like my body is present but my mind is disconnected from the world and I‚Äôm just zoning out constantly. This is usually accompanied with episodes of dizziness throughout the day. The symptoms reached a peak last night at a family event where I just felt so overwhelmed with anxiety that I had to leave and go to my friends house to calm down. When I was at the event, people would try and initiate conversation with me but again, I was just zoning out. I couldn‚Äôt think of anything to say and when I could it just came out in a jumbled mess, like my brain has stopped functioning.  

I‚Äôm also very emotional at the minute, little things are getting on top of me and the other morning, I had a little weep, just out of the blue. 

These symptoms have came at the wrong time as well as I‚Äôm going on a date next week and I‚Äôm just praying my anxiety and brain fog will shift by then. 

Are all these symptoms normal and if so when will they end?",6

I regretted the drugs quickly and took an uber home to avoid relapsing on quitting nicotine and try to sleep it off. I'm 40 days quit. It's been 24h now, I'm basically sober but still am having a hard time resisting the cigs. I feel disappointed in myself for taking the drugs, I feel bad because I wasted my Sunday on this, I feel hurt because this brought some hard memories back and I feel only the cigarettes can make this right.

Make me forget again, make me be at peace, make me recognize myself and feel in control, make the sadness of the loneliness subside... I don't know if I can make it through this night without relapsing, but I'm also scared smoking will make everything worse.

I know I can't be a smoker much longer but I want to feel weak again, I don't want to have to take care of myself in so many instances and I want to allow myself to fail. And if I fail I want to make it worth it, taking drugs isn't worth it, smoking is :(

There are so many things I hate in my life, why can't I have the smokes help me cope, why should I have to face it all without it?

Would it be so bad if I relapsed? Would I lose all my work so far? I don't know if I need it, I wish I knew the future, knew if I got to be weak one more time and still succeed in quitting. I wish I could have had a good time with friends and not have to pay such a high price for it, I wish I would have said no to taking the drugs, I wish instead I would have smoked a cig then and there and had it over with, then come home to recover without this overwhelming wish to relapse.

I didn‚Äôt read it online and I don‚Äôt know it for a fact. 

I just felt it and I have even recently talked about this on the podcast. If in the beginning I was craving cigarettes way more and feeling like the cause of my addiction was it being so embraced in my routines, I later started to only have those cravings in very specific moments of my life when certain actions would take me there.

When you get to stage 2, the one I‚Äôm actually in right now, you have two options, to avoid those situations - for me they are, being tired; I can sleep more, watching people smoking on movies or series; I can start playing games or read more and going for a walk outside; I can just exercise at home - SO, I could avoid it or be strong for a little while more. And this, I actually haven‚Äôt felt yet but I‚Äôm very confident that, if because of my routines, I really wanted to smoke - like, after meals, after sex, stepping out of the tube, whatever - and now I don‚Äôt, this craving I have now, will certainly fade with time as well.

6 A.M. Woke up this morning with a massive headache and made a pot of coffee with wandering thoughts of the day ahead.

**Reflection of Day - 1**

It was fucking hard |Mental torture is real | Anger is fierce |  Bursts of anger hurt

Although I failed yesterday morning (smoking a butt), I conquered during the day with a solid mind and concrete decision to quit.

But this is not my first rodeo. I quit about 10 years ago for 5 years straight. WTF happened? (That‚Äôs another story that I tell you later). Needless to say, I know how important it is to remind myself of why I chose this path to finally quit, again.  

So I spent the afternoon forest-bathing to offer a reset. I needed solid peace of mind, body and spirit for the treacherous road I started on.

Then the evening came‚Ä¶ .

And I caved in to the mind-bending trickery and the mental torture of my addiction.

I drove to my local convenience store and spent $7.86 to smell like piss. Every stop I made, I stepped out of my car and enjoyed 5 minutes of bliss. Now, that‚Äôs 5 down and 15 to go. 

**Day 2**

Caving in to the weakness.

All I can think about is nicotine in my veins. 

The burning desire deep in my soul seeks to devour me.

I am not angry, but I will be if I rip up the remaining pack of cigarettes that call me by my name.

How many times do I need to attempt to quit? 

When can I finally be rid of the demon that drags me down?

Where‚Äôs that solid commitment I made yesterday?

My mind is weak.

I hate weakness.

What happened to the absolute resolve I made yesterday?

I am tired of this game.

I need to either give in or give up, 

And be resolute to quit without looking back.",14

I need to remember how good it feels this week:

* My hair feels fuller and cleaner.

* All my back pains are GONE. After the last few months constantly feeling some pain in my upper back.

* My acid reflux, while still there, is not paralyzing. It has become controllable.

* My breathing is much better, and as a result my sleep has improved a lot.

Moreover, I must also not forget the sacrifices I made to get through the week:

* MASSIVE lack of concentration. I do not want to go through it again and I want to see it improve again.

* Anxiety, irritability and tiredness

I can now feel that the chemical dependence has calmed down and it is now becoming just a mind game.

The mind game is simple - as time passes I risk forgetting why I quit, and I will be tempted to have ""just one cigarette"", ""one puff"". One is one too many. And eventually the few become many and the many become few. I must never forget what I went through this week and the life I am running from.

I‚Äôm not saying it isn‚Äôt that hard because only I know how hard it was for me, especially in the beginning. You spend your days thinking about it and you really need to have a decent level of self control so you don‚Äôt explode very often.

This topic isn‚Äôt either about the complete process of quitting. Some people may even argue that you never stop being an addict. 

But in fact, after those first, I would say, 20 days, I actually didn‚Äôt have those terrible cravings anymore. 

If, in the beginning, I blamed the fact that during my life, I had been adapting all my routines to the habit of smoking, I after realized how easy it is to create new ones when I stopped feeling my life spinning around that habit.

I hope this is helpful,

I taped it shut really good. On the box I drew a skull and crossbones, wrote the date and ""I'm done with this shit"". I kept the box in my house, not in plain view but under my desk behind some other crap I should probably throw out.


Why did I do this?


Well vaping gear isn't cheap and I know myself well enough to out smart myself. I had a mod and a rebuildable deck, plenty of liquid, a juul with spare pods. Throwing all of this in the trash wasn't going to work for me because I know that it is all too easy to cave and buy a new juul and start vaping. But keeping the box works because since, technically, I already have a juul at home under my desk, I can't waste my money by buying a second juul!


And by the time I got home, thought about the box all taped up with the date on there, either the craving was gone or I begun to remember why I quit in the first place. Vaping sucks.

Saturday, December 5, 2020

4 A.M. - Woke up this morning and decided to quit smoking. I made a pot of coffee and stepped outside to get some fresh air. 

Alright, alright! I knew one cigarette was left in the pack that needed my attention. And I wanted to smoke it; there was no doubt in my mind. 

If I were ‚Äústrong like bull,‚Äù I‚Äôd rip it to shreds. 

But I‚Äôm not. 

In a split moment, my mind was playing tricks on me, racing with so many thoughts and feelings. 

Am I strong enough to endure the torture? 

Am I weak and powerless to give in? 

Who cares? 

I lit my last cigarette and enjoyed every inhale and exhale, feeling the rush of nicotine through my veins. Mmmm!

The burn down my throat...

The taste of piss in my mouth...

Yeah, today is the day to quit.

Earlier this week: My 75-year-old father warned me with his raspy voice to quit smoking asap. He said, ‚ÄúFrankie, you gotta quit now. You think you'll never get old. But, in a blink of an eye, you‚Äôre gonna be 75. Don‚Äôt be like me and take care of your body NOW.‚Äù 

You see, he just spent the past eight days in the hospital due to heart problems caused by smoking. Now he carries an oxygen tank around with him everywhere he goes. I don‚Äôt want to end up like that!

So, today, I decided to quit. 

I decided NOT to be slave to nicotine 

I decided NOT to smell like piss anymore

I decided NOT to lie anymore to my family (closet smoker, as if they don't know)

Although I‚Äôm feeling the urge already, like a crackhead needing a fix, grittin‚Äô teeth,

Just here for some general advice:

\- how long do cravings last for, and when will they begin to subside if i go cold turkey?

\- how bad are withdrawals and what are some easy lil things i can do to aid with muscling through?

\- is going cold turkey the strategy? or is lessening dosages until it becomes easy to slide into having nothing the way?

First time ever posting on any sub, so please excuse me if I break any reddit norms here.

I had my last cigarette Sunday morning and I think this is it this time. Been smoking since I was about 16 (currently 25) and I have tried quitting a few times; usually picking it back up after stress or a few drinks. I‚Äôm hoping that won‚Äôt be the case this time‚Äîand I don‚Äôt think it will be because I‚Äôve quit drinking altogether for my health (same reason for quitting nicotine) and I‚Äôm quitting during one of the most stressful times I‚Äôve ever had (thanks last semester of probation, unless I finish up a few incomplete classes‚Äîwhich I will).

Though I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôm already putting on a bit of weight‚ÄîI‚Äôve been grabbing a snack or something instead of having a cigarette. It‚Äôs definitely not as satisfying; but I‚Äôm liking the physical ritual of making myself something (love to cook) and eating it, plus the time frame is about the same. But this is totally unsustainable‚Äîboth for my health and for my grocery budget.

I don‚Äôt know where else to turn because no one else I know really smokes, and if they do, they haven‚Äôt really given much consideration to quitting (which is their choice of course; quite honestly I also wasn‚Äôt trying too hard at it until I had some health issues come up recently). So I was wondering if anyone would have any advice for this? A smoke break was always a good way to step outside and refresh my mind before restarting work; and it was a nice physical thing to do (my apartment and office are on the second floor of their respective buildings) that didn‚Äôt take so long that I completely forgot about what I was working on. Would love any ideas y‚Äôall might have, especially things that worked for you when quitting was difficult for similar reasons. Anything would be appreciated!

TL;DR: what do you do during a quick work break that isn‚Äôt grabbing a snack or gum?",2

Smoking creeps into my mind under the guise of a perfect answer to those questions: ""Fuck it""

So my dad just died. I have to fly during Corona across the world (I live abroad) to bury him and support my mother who is now alone and deeply depressed. I'm not doing too hot myself either.

My dad was a -very- heavy smoker, we're talking two packs a day constant indoor smoker from the age of 16 to 67. Refused almost point black to even try to quit, even after having a stroke three years ago. 

I quit myself in February this year after almost 6 years at a pack a day. Seeing the way it utterly decimated his health was no small part of the reason why I quit.

I really don't want this to be the reason I pick up again, I'm so proud of myself for having quit and I never want my health to get to the point his got to. It's going to be so hard back in the US, without my support group and friends, and with super easy accessibility to cigarettes at every gas station. The reason I picked up again last time (I started young and then quit during college) was because of the death of a loved one.

She‚Äôs a former smoker who quit completely in her mid-late teens (about 2-3 years ago) without vaping. Despite my advice, she bought a juul back in the spring, claiming she wouldn‚Äôt get addicted. Boy was she wrong. 

About 6 months later, and she‚Äôs extremely addicted. She started right away at 5%, we‚Äôve worked down to 1.5%, but she can‚Äôt go any lower. To make up for lower nic percentage, she uses her juul almost 24/7, goes to sleep with it under her pillow. If she goes even a few hours without it, she begins experiencing withdrawal symptoms. When she runs out of pods, she‚Äôs on her way to the convenience store within minutes. 

I‚Äôve seen her go to concerning extremes to get her fix. Hoarding piles of ‚Äúempty‚Äù pods in the bedside drawer for when she runs out, in hopes she‚Äôll be able to get a drop or two of juice out of one of the discarded pods. I‚Äôve watched her crack open pods to fill them with a random, old bottle of juice from the back of the drawer. She keeps a spare nord in the drawer, with an incredibly burnt pod, that she‚Äôll suffer through using when she‚Äôs out of juul pods and can‚Äôt get any right away. Despite the horrible taste and awful health effects of using a burnt pod, she does it anyways. 

She goes through about $50 worth of pods a week or more, it‚Äôs eaten up hundreds upon hundreds of dollars. She agrees that it‚Äôs time to quit, that her addiction has become unhealthy on many levels, and she wants to do it by Christmas. It‚Äôs now December 1st, and she‚Äôs made no progress. She lasts maybe a few hours on each attempt, weaning doesn‚Äôt seem to work for her, what can I do to help? What are some recommended methods of quitting?",1

Not everyone's journey is the same, do what you gotta do whether it's cold turkey, gum, vaping, patches, petting kittens, whatev.

I just found this sub after I finally found the motivation to stop smoking. I know this might sound ridicolous for some people, since im only on it for about 6 months, but for me personally, its a big step since I'm getting quite easily addicted to stuff. 

Anyways, I wanna get to the point. I'm an 18 year old from the South-West of Germany. (And yes, I have to excuse myself from any grammar or spelling mistakes I make here, but I'm giving my best.) In the last half-year I kinda sorta picked up smoking, but I have been a party smoker a year before that I guess. Since then, I had a lot of stress and trouble with a relationship that was extremely important to me and it sadly didn't turn out the way I wanted it to. Smoking felt extremely comfortable around that time, many peers picked up smoking as well, hence I didnt really look at it as an severely outrageous thing to do, even though I absolutely knew the risks and consequences. (My dads been a heavy (!) smoker for... basically all his life) 

But after some other life-changing decisions, I decided to quit as well. I know I dont need them, Its all in my head. Gotta work through it anyways, and cigs wont solve the problem. (Probably make it worse even)

So yes, I stopped for about 40 hours now, I have small cravings here and there, gotta say Its not too too bad but Im still proud of myself anyways. 

Thanks for anybody reading this! I hope It will give me more motivation to never start again in the future, since all yall can control me now ;)

I believe you have to find a reason to quit so mine was covid and not being able to walk up a flight of stairs without breathing and money.

I've  been using siberia snus which is very strong every other weekend (about half  a can per day on those weekends), and I've found that when I don't use  it, I'm significantly less motivated than before my snus usage to do  anything at all. I wonder if I've messed up my brain's dopamine system  and now can't feel reward or motivation to do anything else.

I've  tried stopping for 1.5 months and didn't see a return of my motivation  to do anything. I can only watch youtube and browse reddit on a regular  day. but when I take it, I feel motivated to work on my business and be  what I would consider to be a normal person. I'm not even sure that my  motivation will ever return if I stop for longer since it's all very  unclear to me (I'm not a daily user and I've stopped for over a month  with no improvement, so I'm not sure if I'm naturally an unmotivated  person and that's why I'm drawn to snus, or if it's withdrawals, or even  semi-permanent or permanent damage to my dopamine system).

Has  anyone experienced this, and if so, have you tried to stop for longer  and seen a return in motivation to do basic things. How long did that  take? Have you stopped and seen no improvement?

Any help or thoughts are very much appreciated.",3

Always depending if I stayed at my parents place (I would drink coffee) or if I stayed in the city in my shared flat for university (we dont have a coffee machine there). Corona lockdown made me change location a lot.

This routine stayed the same within those 7 weeks after quitting, but after 5 weeks without cigarettes i started feeling like shit whenever I got home to my parents place, cravings were bad in the afternoon. I couldnt enjoy staying there anymore believing it was the location itself.

So I watched my habits carefully and did some research, as it turns out all that happened because caffeine can trigger nicotine cravings, even if you havent been a coffee drinker. I havent been either.

All terrible reasons for me to be smoking 2-3 packs of cigarettes a day in my early 20s. I got into the vape scene after I realized how my body was being affected by cigarette smoking. I've been in the vape community/industry for about 8 years now and still vape to this day.

Currently I'm still in the vape industry, working behind the scenes doing marketing. I vape one disposable a day but I've been trying to reduce the amount of times that I hit my device a day.  I'd actually like to quit nicotine all together so that my...issues...can eventually subside once all the nicotine is out of my system.I've already tried to ween off, using 3mg in my aspire cloudflask. But find myself going back to the disposable..

&#x200B;

My question is...What can I expect if I quit cold turkey?  
How long must I go through withdrawal symptoms until I'm ""normal"" again?  
Is there possibly an easier way of getting off of nicotine COMPLETELY after inhaling it for almost 8 years? Is working in the industry going to make it harder for me to quit?

-Breathing is easier

-I don't need to go outside in the cold nearly as often; I've been to the convenience store literally once since I quit

-when I can summon up the energy to exercise I can go way longer

-I don't even really want cigarettes anymore, I get the occasional craving but I've developed decent ways of coping with them and I don't feel totally empty all the time anymore


Cons:

-It's harder to get outside and do things

-it's harder to motivate myself to exercise 

-I keep eating unhealthy, I regularly eat a box of cookies or a large pizza in one or two sittings lately

-My ambition is gone, I haven't been making as much money as I like (I trade stocks for a living, so it's not like I can just go into work and tune out while I work for 8 hours anymore. If I'm feeling bleh and barely there then I don't make money or even lose money)

Maybe I'm just depressed but eventually these cons will likely go away, I just wasn't really expecting how difficult everyday things become when you stop smoking since you can't have a cigarette to look forward to when you get outside or finish a thing you're doing or whatever",3

I've mostly combatted my urge to smoke randomly. I don't have the ""morning coffee break"" smoke, the ""post-lunch"" smoke, the random smoke I have in-between a daily commute, etc.

Thankfully, my wife has been very supportive in helping me quit, and I really want to make it up to her.
