This is the place I enjoyed smoking the most when I drank and since my husband isn't coming, I feel like I will not have anyone to keep me in check. I know having another puff will probably swing me back to smoking but I also have a hard time imagining being there by the sunset and drink and not being able to smoke!

I was raised in a non-smoking home and taught that it was very bad.  I knew better but I did it anyways.  Once I moved out in 2020, I started to vape/smoke. Nobody pressured me to do so, I just was curious.  I also was sad a close relative of mine passed away.  So I decided to pick up a vape.  Shortly after, I bought a pack of cigarettes.  Last year in the first quarter, I smoked alot.  Then I turned to vaping. Now I stopped vaping and went back to smoking.  I'm a mess.  On top of this, my family has no idea.  They view me as somebody that would never do something like this.  

I live alone.  I support myself and sadly, have nobody to talk to.  I have a history of depression.  I haven't told anyone about it.  I know this isn't a depression subreddit but I'm pretty sure this is what lead me to start in the first place.  I have nothing to look forward to. With smoking/vaping, it gives me something to look forward to.  I wake up easier and come home more excited when I do it.   I am absolutely terrified that somebody will find out.  It scares me to the core.  

A few weeks back, I was without nic for about a week until something triggered my depression and now, I'm hooked again.  

I just came home with my favorite cigarettes.  I was super excited to smoke after being without for a day (yes, I was trying to quit).   

I decided to buy some herbal cigarettes from Amazon to help to get me away from the real thing since vaping didn't help and is really expensive.  

My biggest fear is that once I stop smoking, I will have nothing to mask my inner pain.  I won't be able to get rid of that extreme craving feeling in my gut (I'm not talking about nic craving, it's something else and I've never been able to figure it out).  And worst of all, I'll have nothing to look forward to.  

So I don't know what to do.  I feel really bad for getting another pack.  But at the same time, I feel better....at least for a little while.

I’ve been with my partner since 2014 and got married in 2020. Since we’ve been together, I was a daily smoker (~15 cigs a day) while he was a social smoker (2+ packs a weekend). I always felt like he looked down on me for smoking even though when we’d go out, he’d chain smoke whereas I’d smoke at my usual rhythm.

Anyways, he quit smoking socially as his 2020 New Years’ Resolution and would urge me to quit too, but I just didn’t feel ready then. I had several failed attempts beforehand and didn’t feel like quitting just then. I know he wanted me to quit for my own good, but I also felt that in his eyes, smoking was only ok if he was in the mood for it. 

I finally quit in November 2020 with the help of Champix and I wouldn’t wish to go back to smoking. I’m very happy with my decision, but I must say that at first I felt kind of rushed into quitting. I felt a bit resentful at times, especially when we’d go out at the beginning and I’d start jonesing for a cigarette. He’d straight up tell me that I should never smoke again while saying that it wouldn’t be a problem if he smoked. I guess it was his way of saying that his will power is stronger than my addictive personality, and I know it’s true. 

Last night I had to stay home doing a work project and my husband went out with friends. He came home super late and I could smell the tobacco on his skin. This morning I asked him if he smoked and he admitted he did, but only one. I’m a bit annoyed and quite disappointed with him. I know he would be super disappointed with me if I had smoked and I have had plenty of chances to do so. But I haven’t and I won’t. And not because he’d be mad at me (though that is a big factor), but because I’d be mad at me. I’ve made a commitment to myself that I’m going to respect my body and I’ll go through with it. I just wish he wasn’t so one-sided with this; if he does it, there’s no problem, but if I had done it, it would have been such a disappointment.

She had insisted on leaving the hospital, they made her sign a waiver because they felt she was at risk based on her oxygen levels. She was 45. That Waiver hasn’t moved from the spot she left it. None of us can even look at it. The doctors had been telling her that it was going to kill her for the last 10 years. And I had to listen as the warnings became more and more dire. She had a life expectancy of 4 years at the time of her death. She was 45. I saw my mother on the kitchen floor, naked, convulsing as a team of EMTs tried to save her. They couldn’t. All of our lives are in shambles now. I work overnights at a gas station, having to sell the same things that killed my mother to dozens of people each night.

There was a post about whether or not you actually enjoy most of the cigarettes you smoke in a day, or if you do it just to make the sick feeling go away. It got me thinking, and I started paying attention.

I “enjoyed” almost NONE of the cigarettes I smoked a day! One or two if I was lucky. Everything was just to escape the physical ache, or keep my hands busy, or force of habit. And once I noticed it started to feel like a chore, especially out in the cold winter air. Once I realized this, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Then every smoke break turned into me thinking about how much I was wasting my life and how trapped I was. Either that, or remembering my grandmother’s face as she died of COPD and complications from smoking related cancer. Do that 20 times a day for a few weeks and it adds up.

I reduced the amount of cigarettes I was smoking over 10 days and I had my last cigarette 5 days ago. I started vaping some years ago and I'm only vaping now, hopefully to make the transition easier.

I've battled with depression for many, many years and I've been in a downswing for about 6 months now. It's happened very slowly but this month has been really hard for me. Since the start of this week I've been struggling more with depression and yesterday something in me just snapped and I was feeling so much anxiety and feeling so depressed that I just wanted to die. I spent the majority of yesterday just crying and holding myself.

From what I've read nicotine withdrawal can induce depression and especially bad depression with people who are predisposed to it. What I'm wondering is if it's the nicotine itself or the smoking, because I'm still getting nicotine with vaping.

Another thing I'm wondering is if these feelings will subside if I start smoking again. I do want to quit but if it's ruining my mental health then I think it's better for me to do it when my mental health hasn't been declining for half a year.

The spiritual progress I've made in the last few months is pretty cool.

I'm looking for certain medical treatments in the next few years that basically require me to quit smoking, among other things. Last time I had a general anaesthetic was in September 2018 and when they did the pre-surgery testing I could barely even blow into that meter thing, whatever it's called. 

And even that didn't stop me.

I've tried most NRTs, nothing worked out. I can't use patches or gum, one for allergy reasons, and I'd rather not explain the other. The little cartridge thing you inhale from, not an e-cig but I don't remember what it's called, that didn't work either. E-cigs weren't feasible long term because I couldn't get the inhale on it right, which meant no nicotine. As for medications, I'm wary of them because of my medical history. So I kept saying screw it, I'll smoke til it kills me. 

Then I got told I wasn't likely to get the treatment I wanted without quitting. I sighed, bought more tobacco (online tobacconist) and then told myself to stop being an idiot and bought myself another e-cig and the liquids. 

Still got the tobacco, but I'm not smoking it. I know e-cigs aren't a cure all and they have their own problems but I need this, and it's going to be my best chance. I smoked a pretty strong tobacco, and it's only been a few hours, but it's not hurting. I'm cautiously optimistic. It's never felt so...like the anxiety doesn't exist.

I smoked from the ages of 14 to 20, and age 33 to this Monday night. Have experienced restless nights, closing my eyes and seeing fleeting thoughts. I can't sleep properly. I keep waking. My arms and legs jolt me awake. Also I have a strange on/off pinching pain in my left chest that also flashes in my right lower jaw, around my wisdom tooth. Not sure if this is an unrelated issue. The pain doesn't stop me from running, which I did today, and I ran at an average pace of 300 metres per 60 seconds.

I have night terrors and wake up with a fast beating heart, feeling like I'm going to die, why do I exist, why is there a universe, who or what am I, how is there anything in existence. Short one or two second dreams constantly play out. They are violent or benign. I am able to watch them and not take them seriously, but they sometimes shock me. Perhaps it is my brain chemistry changing. 

&#x200B;

The anxiety is intense and it is made worse by a mixture of heartburn and these pinches in my left chest/right lower jaw, which wake me up through palpitations. I have been snoozing in the day to get sleep. Full of new energy now. Haven't smoked for 64 hours. Fitness is returning. Feeling more positive but scared about going to bed and the return of the pains.

Went to see the doctor. He said the pinching pains were from nicotine withdrawal and everything I have thus experienced so far is due to nicotine withdrawal and quitting cold turkey, though I suspect I may have to see a dentist about the jaw pain. I just hope it's not connected to my heart! The doctor told me to go back and see him next week if there is still pain or if I'm still having trouble sleeping. He also said if I can run 2 to 3 km without stopping (which I can) then my heart and lungs are in top condition.

Cried a lot yesterday. Cried less today but still feel the urge to. I am very emotional right now. The underlying depression has returned to the surface but I can find new ways to deal with that. Starting to enjoy other peoples' company more and I have said hello and smiled at a few more people today. I need some new hobbies. I want to take up gardening and make some new friends locally. I want to spend more time outside than in front of a screen. I hope things continue to improve and I hope I can get proper sleep again.

I didn't have an issue quitting. I went cold turkey and threw half the last pack away. Was a smoker for 9 years and didn't even like doing it. Was just a habit.

2 months into 2022 and I can't stop thinking about smoking one now. It's not out of the blue. This has been the hardest year of my adult life so far. My mom committed suicide in January, for the first time I'm jobless and moving across the country and every step of that has just been the most painful process. This sucks. Shit just sucks.

I'm not going to, but I can't stop thinking about just lighting up and just trying to pass the stress. I feel like I was such a different person back then, able to work through this stress and heavy shit. And all I want right now is to just go back to being that type of person that could summon that determination from somewhere. Whenever I had an issue, I'd hop in the car, light some smokes, throw on some jazz and just cruise and everything would be good and work itself out. It was like a little ritual to bring me back into alignment. Now there's nothing.

This is hard. Even for someone going on 4 years without a drag, this is hard. It's not the cigarettes itself trying to pull me back, it's the depression, the life situations, the loneliness. Even though I stopped years ago, it's part of those memories in my life where everything was ok as opposed to now where everything is decidedly not ok.

This isn't a motivational piece I know. But I just needed somewhere to air things out. And I really want to smoke but instead I'll just get back to packing.",36,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9904645681381226}"

It's a very simple app. It is a constant timer that you reset if you relapse. When resetting, you enter a log on what caused/triggered the relapse. This is so that users can learn from past mistakes. There are different ranks that you achieve as your streak grows. There are also resources for helping to overcome addictions. I made this app with motivation and positivity in mind. It is themed and has the feel of a fantasy type of game/journey I guess you could say.

This came to my mind tonight after I caved after 80 days smoke free without a single regret.

“Learn how to use it properly, not abuse it because than you’ll be sorry.”

I actually felt relieved because it felt like a heavy backpack had been lifted off my shoulders. I’m not a smoker, I am not a non smoker. I am simply who I am in this moment. A human being.

The question I’m asking myself is could the calming effect tobacco produces be utilized in such a way that the need to smoke would simply be non-existent when the human being awakens to that state of consciousness. Peace and calm in the mind... that the cigarette once produced but in realizing it was always there to begin with it wasn’t the cigarette at all. 

This has been my experience from a 2 pack per day smoker to a stressed out trying to be healthy non-smoker who just wanted to speed everything up. I had panic attacks right up until I lit that cigarette. I had built up something that wasn’t even there in the first place. I believe counting the days (I can only speak for myself) is absolutely stupid in the regard it adds more stress. Take off the backpack, I feel like everyday/every new lesson life throws my way is bringing me closer to clarity of mind. (I just need to be patient and kind to myself)

I just wanted to say that I think I am done here on this sub. I have stopped checking posts here. I no longer identify as a smoker, or even an ex-smoker. Its just not on the radar any more, so I don’t think in those terms. I can drink if I wish, even join the smokers to continue conversation without even a hint of a craving. I have the odd memory sometimes like “the old me would have smoked in this situation”, but it’s more like a memory than a craving.

I did have one instance though where I opened a pack of staples for a staple gun and it’s the same package style as a cigarette pack. The action of opening the pack and drawing out a row of staples caused my brain to think I was opening a pack of smokes and pulling out a smoke. The behaviour was automatic, instinctual really. I found the urge to find a lighter and put something to my lips was so overwhelming that I had to sit down for a few minutes. It was still not a nicotine craving, but some sort of an automatic behaviour sequence event that was weird and hard to stop. 

Other than that, it gets easier, every day. I don’t even miss it a little. I have been through several deaths now, lost friends, new job, etc. and I made it through. If I can, you can too.

So along with quitting tobacco six months ago (was very hard to quit, I had all of the symptoms) I also cut way back on alcohol (have only drank 4 times in almost 10 months.) I had been saying I was going to drink for a night to celebrate a big life event that is in the midst of happening and I threw caution to the wind and also bought a pack just to have a couple while drinking. So I kind of sort of enjoyed the wine yet woke up the next day with either the WORST hangover EVER or potentially a stomach illness (probably both!) So....of course I could not hold down food or water- lets smoke! I smoked a couple the day after drinking and then the following day ran water over the last of the tobacco and it was easy to not smoke at all. WELL...then some serious life stress came about and of course I bought a PACK and continued to smoke for 5 days. After smoking for five days I am now on day 3 of my re-quit and here are my main take a ways of smoking briefly after being craving free and a happy non smoker 6 months in.

1. Alcohol is not that fun , always leads to a brief relapse and I do not wish to continue this habit.
2. Because I was quit and detoxed for six months the quitting after 5 days of light smoking is no where near the original quit (thank goodness.)
3. The WHOLE time I was smoking it really, really sucked. It was disgusting, my throat hurt and it made my feel ill. Constantly I had a pit of anxiety about quitting.
4. TOBACCO IS A FREAKING TRAP, not only was it UNENJOYABLE I just kept doing it to avoid the ""withdrawal symptoms"" and this happened quickly too! It was interesting and informative to go from never wanting to smoke to being trapped again and it made me realize how awful nicotine really is.
5. I had a couple near panic attacks after not having any for a long time, my chest hurt and my sleep quality went to near abysmal while using tobacco.
6. I realize I really, really AM A NON SMOKER! I MADE IT! The feeling of being proud of myself and moving towards healthy habits feels amazing and the feeling of smoking was so much like a full blown sadness/depression that I know I will never fall into the nicotine trap again.

I haven't had a cigarette in over 3 whole days! (77 hours total, because for me it feels more encouraging to see the hours tick by faster) they say that days 3-7 are when things can get worse for withdrawal so i wanted to enter in to the new week with a positive mindset ready to hold strong.

Some cool things to that have happened now that i am nicotine free:

1. I have played with my cat more and given her the attention she deserves

2. My body feels less icky, less like I'm just a little bit off from center at amy given moment.

3. I wake up feeling less tired and more rested. 
(This one is cool to think about because one of my excuses not to quit had always been that i need the reward pf a cigarette in the morning to get out of bed, so take that you stinky excuse!!)

4. I feel more present in my daily life. 

5. According to my app i have regained 3 hours of time in the past 3 days not smoking (its probably more in reality), and ive used that time to do things that are more enjoyable and better for my health.

6. Started to reconnect with parts of myself that enjoy life.
(Smoking cigarettes was always like a slow form of shortening my expiry date, so it's been an important part of my journey to reconnect with myself in terms like health and happiness.)

7. Been spoiled a little bit by my support system, but because of some of the things listed above, it feels more genuine and emotional than that. I am able to fully appreciate the small ways that my support system, friends and family, are rooting for me and here to celebrate even just the little steps. This sub has done the same, so thank you all for being supportive and genuinely good folks.

Well, consider this: vaping was first available for most people in around 2004. This was 18 years ago. 

I did a test on the site ""[https://shouldiscreen.com/English/lung-cancer-risk-calculator](https://shouldiscreen.com/English/lung-cancer-risk-calculator)"". Basically, I said I was an average smoker who smoked for 20 years (roughly the time someone would have vaped if he started vaping right after it became available) and was now 40 years old. Considering most old people do not vape (it is most common in teens and young adults), I can say that this is not an unfair comparison. The results: almost no one had lung cancer. So, it is to soon to say vaping is a safe alternative. Most young smokers that will develop lung cancer will do so later on, not immediately while they are still young. Most vaping people are young and we did not have time to study what happens later on.

I even went as far as including a date and time for when I had quit. 

Perhaps the most crushing thing for me was that I gave in the day after I made the desktop background, and went back to chain smoking. I kept the background on my PC and would forget about it after opening some programs, but was reminded every morning how badly I failed.

At one point I really believed that I would never quit smoking, must have been feeling this way until around December. I think the image encouraged me though and kept the idea of quitting in my mind. I ended up buying a vaporizer and going with 3mg of nicotine per 100ml of e-liquid. 

I went on and off with a vape and smoking for about a month, then I transferred fully onto vaping, but only when I was at home (no vape or smoking away from the house). I used the vape alone until February 16th. I got really tired of using a vape, because leaking juice, having to order parts/juice, the taste of battery, the burning on my lips from overheating, the horrible smell of it, having to charge something that is a craving, and the remaining feeling that I was doing something terrible for my health.

I actually used this vape with a groggy coil for about a day before putting it to the side and giving up with it, I didn't smoke or vape since that moment. 

One thing I did to help with the first few days was to buy a load of different mints, cough drops and sugar free sweets to try out, it felt like I was taste testing them since I never eat this kind of thing, they worked great for oral sensation so far. 

The last thing I want to say is kind of cliche, and I am sure some people will think ""famous last words"", but I genuinely have lost my craving for cigarettes or nicotine in general, I thought dropping the vape would have been worse, but it was really only bad for 2 days, possibly since I switched to 3mg vape first. When I think of smoking/vaping now, I feel like I've had enough negative experience from it that I don't see it as a one off pleasurable experience anymore, instead I am seeing it as an unhealthy long term investment.

Vaping I used it while driving doing my deliveries so at my job and at home, constantly, hitting it about every minute or so. 

I have smoked cigarettes for two years and vaped for six years. This is my personal hell. This is psychological warfare except the war is with myself. These are some of the worst withdrawal symptoms i've ever had next to getting off of Anti-psychotic medication (seroquel). After I eat I instinctively still reach for my vape which isn't there, and then I throw a small tantrum unless i'm in public, then i'm forced to hold it in.

I have so much anxiety and I feel extremely suicidal.

You gave me a kind of validation for being wherever I was, and a reason to leave when I didn’t want to be. You kept me company in my loneliest times, my darkest walks home. You were there when I was surrounded by friends and I wanted to sneak away to be with you. I never felt alone, I didn’t have to. We sat together in beautiful places - on beaches watching a sunset, on cafe terraces watching the world go by, in smoky rooms in bars and clubs. We made friends together. We had lovers together. You were my reward for a stretch of hard work and a consolation for something gone wrong. 

I needed you. I would walk miles through rain or snow for you. I would spend the last of my money on you. You were so important to me. I couldn’t stand being without you. 

I miss you sometimes, but it’s not sad. I’m making my way alone now. I’m learning so much. I’m learning how to be with myself and nothing else, to be where I am and take it all in, to be in the “now” and feel it. I’m learning how to sit in the discomfort of my feelings: anxiety, sadness, even happiness. I can have difficult situations and not run away from them to the comfort of you. I’m learning who I am, what I like about myself and what parts I can work on. I can accept what I can’t change. I have more time to spend on getting things done; lots of small things that lead to bigger accomplishments, things that I held off on for so long are finally getting done. My mind is getting stronger. 

I can fill my lungs all the way down into my belly and breathe my anxiety out. I can run, my legs pushing the ground away, blood coursing through my veins, powerful. My body is getting stronger. I can breathe! 

Thank you for being there until now, but I don’t need you anymore. We were great together but I’m infinitely greater without you. 

Goodbye, friend.

A non-smoker after 8 years. Yay!!

I had my first 4mg nicorette gum after that (at around 9:30) and just had my second one (at around 12). This is my second time quitting and the first time i made it 3 weeks with no cigs (then bummed cigs twice that i smoked immediately at a convention, the atmosphere was great and a lot of drinking and smoking going on that night just outside the hotel lobby) and then 5 weeks with no major relapse (which i qualify as possessing extra cigarettes/buying a pack and obviously smoking them). 

The first time i quit i didnt really mind cold turkey, i was irritable and stuff but i dont know how agonizing it was beyond the first 3 days really. The main issue for me is the psychological factors and triggers. This leads to my main point: im not really sure if NRT/Nicotine gum is for me? I am using it because it was motivation to set a quit date after my dad got it for me for christmas. He spent money on it (heavily discounted with a coupon) so it feels kind of bad to not use it, but i kind of feel like it is just prolonging something that doesnt need to be? Since the psychological battle is the real war im not sure this is any different beyond delaying physical withdrawals. I feel like if there is nicotine in my system wouldnt that just make it easier to pick up cigarettes again?

So ive had 2 pieces of gum already. The questions ive been asking myself are: do you just want to get through day 1 with them and quit? Do you want to treat it as something you only do when you have cravings and not by the timeline dosage on the box? Do you want to follow the timeline dosage and see what happens since its a different method than before? Im leaning toward just forgetting about the gum entirely after tonight (possibly letting my dad hold onto it in case i change my mind) and just going through the withdrawals cold turkey. Since i cant go out and bum cigarettes from folks due to covid id say theres less chance of me slipping up like before. At this point im feeling pretty solid about quitting so i dont know whether i even need the gum. I have a therapist, i have supportive family, i can work on the habits that trigger cravings. I dont live alone anymore and moved back in with my parents which i think will also be a huge factor in keeping clean this time.

At first it went great, the novelty of the vape made it easy for me to adapt, and as I mainly smoked on my balcony (didn't want my appartement to smell like shit when guest came over) I didn't had many triggers at first. However as more time passed, it became increasingly hard, first I saw a picture of one of my friend smoking, then I found an old lighter in a vest I haven't worn since before I stopped and finally a friend handed me a spliff, all of that basically reignited a very strong craving for tobacco that I haven't felt since I started vaping.

2 weeks ago when I went out to buy ejuice, I bought myself a pack just because I craved one so badly and since i've tasted again how satisfying it feels compared to a vape, it's the return of the vicious circle of ""I'm not buying another one after this one"" then finding every excuse to buy another one (like yesterday I was literally like ""i'm going to the bar and my vape ran out of battery, cigs time"").

I know it's going to fully come back, right now i'm smoking about 3 a day but a few weeks ago it was 0 and i'm worried it's going to increase more and more. I've thought about trying to find ways to make my vape more satisfying, i'm already vaping 16mg (any juice below i'm just chain vaping the shit out of them and they barely last a day), but rn i'm kinda lost, it's hard to occupy myself too, as i'm studying web development rn and just sitting at a computer makes me crave smoking. Maybe I should just stick to my vape for a few days/weeks until it fully passes but some days it's just so hard. That's why I was asking for some advices and ideas, to make the cravings pass more easily, and find strategies in order for that pack to be truly the last i'll ever buy and do better than this first attempt.

edit : and it's not even like I don't have any good incentives to stop or instant consequences, cigs makes me tired af for 30min - 1h after I do smoke one, it easily messes with my day and back then I even developed a caffeine addiction to counter it, this along with wheezing and that painful cough in the morning are things I never want to see come back",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9990149736404419}"

It changed my mind from ""I want to quit smoking"" to ""I want to quit smoking AND I don't want to smoke anymore."" This shift in thought was a game changer. 2)I used nic gum in emergencies. I started with the good stuff and when that was gone I got the knock off brand. It wasn't as good and I ended up giving it all away when I felt like I didn't need it anymore. 3) This group. I came here a lot in those first couple of months. The support I found here sealed the deal for me. This morning I woke up to a notification that said 150 days smoke free.

- It's not worth my time. 
- It's not beneficial in any way. It's a plain addiction spiral.
- It makes me waste money. 
- The absence of smokes makes me an irritable person.
- I am destroying my body in multiple ways. Increased risk of heart and lung disease. 
- Long term smoking will make me look like shit.
- It limits my physical potential.
- I use it as a crutch in social situations.
- makes me feel like I'm not in control of my life. A rolled dried leaf is on the driving seat.
- makes me less confident about myself.
- is not an attractive quality in any way. The quite opposite, actually. 
- quitting will improve my sense of taste in the long run.
- smokers smell like shit. 
- if I were a non smoker, I would not like the company of a smoker.
- because I can.
- so that I have the authority to convince my dad to quit smoking.
- I will stop supporting a clearly evil industry that profits off killing people.
- even if right now it may not seem like a big problem, one day it will be. It will either be 5x more difficult to quit or too late to start trying.
- mom will be happy.
- One is too much - a thousand is never enough.
- The first one doesn’t do anything for you. It doesn’t satisfy anything because there’s no physical craving. All it does it set up the craving for the one after that.",33,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9995924830436707}"

I wake up. Get out of bed. Living my life and then my neck start to hurt. Deep down I know it's nothing but when that happens my brain tells me I'm going to die. I can now spend a couple of hours(at first days) thinking about this and my pain keeps getting worst.
Sometimes I can distract myself it's OK. I can manage for the end of the day.

And the next day my hip hurts.. or I can't breathe properly...

This is insane. Never have that before. Only after I stopped smoking. I'm positive that I can't have this many diseases. 

Did anyone have that? The only reason I'm thinking about smoking is to get rid of this anxiety. Then I'm angry and want to punch myself in dick for this thinking. I should seek some help with doctors but life sucks and my appointments can be next month and its expensive. To be honest it's exhausting...

I've made it to day 4, it's been tough at times and the cravings are intense still but I'm feeling positive. I am noticing that my smoker friends really aren't supporting my decision to quit. Example: I booked a weekend away for my birthday next month and just wrote into the group chat to say I was cancelling it because it was causing me more stress while quitting. I said I felt it was too soon for me to be tested like that and I need to ensure I feel strong enough before I do group outings involving alcohol/smoker's etc. My smoking friends don't seem to understand this and think I'm far too stressed and anxious. I explained that I'm not losing my mind, I'm just being very careful with any social gathering while I do this, as I haven't before and have ended up smoking when I was trying to quit. I am going to spend the next 2 months minimum not drinking and only being in comfortable situations so that I can ensure I have no triggers. I think that's reasonable!

I have never came close to actually quitting and this is the first time I succeeded out of thousands of attempts

I have made it to the other side and it feels incredible, I wake up in the morning and nicotine is not the first thing on my mind. I see others smoke and I actually look at them with a bit of pity instead of envy. 

Some things that helped me quit below:

*disclaimer - this is just how I quit, everyone has there own tactics and what worked for me may not work for you*

- Completely cold turkey RIP OF THE BANDAGE THERE IS NO BETTER TIME.

- Didn’t try to stay away from others who smoke from day 1, I needed to get used to, and accept the fact that I need to be around others smoking and control myself.

- Don’t use any sort of NRT or anything like that, how can you quit a drug by giving yourself more of that drug? It will just drag on the torture longer

- Drink LOTS of water, I mean it, I’m not sure why but it just makes me feel great and get over cravings. 

- First days will be a absolute torture, but once you make it 14 days or even 7, every day gets so much better. There may be random off days where you get bad cravings but you need to have a strong mentality.
- I strongly recommend reading Allen Carr’s easy way to quit smoking, it changed my mindset on the way I think about smoking COMPLETELY. Get it on audible if you don’t like reading.
- Don’t try to distract your thoughts from the idea of smoking, keep reminding yourself that your finally free of this poison nicotine. That nicotine does absolutely nothing for you and is controlling your life and actually makes you more stressed, more anxious and generally makes you enjoy life less.
- Don’t wait for something to happen, nothing in your life is gunna suddenly and drastically change on day 3, day 7 or day 14, you are a non-smoker from the first day that you are quit. 
- Tell your friends your quitting, tell your family, tell your neighbours and tell your pets. This is not only for the reason that you don’t want to be a failure to them if you don’t make it. But also it is for support. Having friends congratulate me for making it farther kept me going on the tough days.
- NOT ONE CIGARETTE. This trap is what I have always fallen into. “just one cigarette and then I’ll continue, I made it this far”. It doesn’t work, never did and never will. Putting nicotine in your body will essentially reset your progress. And also if you haven’t smoked for long enough it will taste disgusting, the same as your first cig did because you have no nicotine in your system .
- Lastly, the biggest game changer was mindset. Changing the way you think about everything. Not “oh no I can’t smoke tonight and everyone will be smoking” think “thank god I can enjoy my night without inhaling literal poison in to my lungs”. Instead of thinking “This is gunna be so hard to make it through this day without smoking” think of how amazing your lungs and body will feel when you do make it without smoking.
- And trust me, your body will thank you also. You will feel better, be less tired, better skin, sleep better and much much more. 

You can do it, anyone can do it.

I'm sure the long-term answer if this keeps arising would be some anti-anxiety medication but I doubt I'll be heading out to get that today and my go-to has always been smoking. And yes, I know that smoking doesn't actually ease anxiety, but my brain seems to think it does.

Figure out why.,"During this most recent quit I've really been trying to sit with my thoughts and feelings as the nicotine free hours and days pass by. I've been working hard doing some psychological analysis to try to find out what's really going on with this addiction. 

I'm beginning to realize that nicotine addiction has been a mask for a lot of latent feelings I've shoved very deep down inside. For so many years, so much of my subconcious response to negative emotions was being quelled and repressed by my substance abuse. *Any time I felt any kind of way, nicotine was the answer.* Whether the feelings were elation, upset, rage, reward, or boredom - It become my Feel Anything drug.

This gave me a profound realization: Something so toxic, so harmful, something LETHAL is my closest friend, my confidant, the one who makes me feel safe. When anything happened in my life I was going to this ""person"" to hand all my emotions over to them. In a sick way I realized: *It's an abusive partner. I'm choosing to be abused.*

* ""I just finished my project, I feel so satisfied.""


* ""I'm bored, you want to do something?""

* ""You would never survive without me. Not even for a few hours.""


* ""You won't believe how mad I'm going to get if you try to leave me.""


* ""Don't you dare go on that trip without me or I will make your life hell.""


* *""One day I might kill you.""*

My husband (36M) is really struggling with quitting smoking and I just don't know how to help, it's causing a toll on our relationship.

We both smoked since we were ~18. We quit about a year ago by switching to vaping and at that time talked about how happy we were to have quit, the money, how much healthier we felt. 

 I quit vaping shortly after finding out I was pregnant. He got down to switching between 1mg and 0mgs nicotine but couldn't kick the habit entirely. He actually quit cigarettes long before I could.

Stupidly we thought he could just smoke for a vacation a few months ago. Then just for the holidays. He promised it was temporary and we had wanted to be ""social smokers who just did it for special occasions!"", and he of course backslid and smokes all the time now. He smokes a puff or two, puts it out, restarts it... so while he's smoking about a pack per week and a half, he is constantly smoking.
(It's been extremely difficult. I have a very hard time staying away from smoking unless I completely avoid it and now it's in my face all the time. It makes me resentful too).

He's still allegedly trying to quit but whenever a pack runs out, by day 3/4 he starts being super mean and unhappy. He bought the patch but says it doesn't work. I think he expects it to do everything for him and of course it can't.

The issue is around day 3-4 he suddenly ""never wanted to quit"" and resents me for ""controlling him"". He gets so angry and won't listen, he's a terrible partner to me and he starts fights and eggs them on until they are so bad he feels justified in running out and buying a new pack because he's that upset/stressed. I can't de-escalate anything, I have tried going to different parts of the house and hiding out but he just keeps on. It ends in extreme emotions and he's threatened divorce and he's slept on the couch instead of fixing things.
Then he'll get the smokes, apologize and say he overreacted and love bomb me to make it up. Then 2 weeks goes by, exact same thing. He's done it 3 times now and it's starting today all over again. He picked a fight last night, carried it to today and I am dreading going home after work. 

I don't know how to help. We wanted to quit before we even thought of having a baby, why would it be different now? How am I controlling when it was something we agreed on and been so proud of ourselves for doing before? I get that baby is on the way and it's stressful but I can't deal with his extreme anger every two weeks and it's not fair to use ""quitting smoking is hard and it makes me stressed and do things I regret"" as a get out of jail free card over and over.

4. after a month: u may think u wanna smoke once a week, but your relation with smoke is dampened now single lapse wont make you smoker... u are well in controll. Only godforsaken thoughts, too much life pressure can make you go back to the ugly relation you have with smoke. 
But if you are good at heart, if you want to tackle life fair n square being natural. As all non smokers do with 146 other options for every life problem. You get your life back. Congratulations !!!

I quit nearly 4 years back when I switched to vaping. You could just about get a pack of cheaper cigs for under £10. I'd normally smoke tobacco as I couldn't afford cigs anymore. I'd still spend £30 a week using it sparingly. Occasionally I'd buy cigs for a night out or special occasion. 

Today, I stood behind someone being charged £13.50 for JPS blue. One of the budget brands here in the UK. Assuming he smokes a pack a day, that's £400 a month on cigarettes these days.

I decide to make something I really want to do on that symbolic date : I will be the mirror of myself at the begining of that day... Who was I during these 25 last years ? A consistent smoker, around 15 cigarettes a day, and I now decide that I want to become the reverse of that : I will stop smoking in less than one week.

Like a lot of smokers, I've sadly tried doing a lot of things to stop tobacco : brutal stop, slow reduction, using apps, using patches, reading books. And as you can guess, it didn't work. But I now know that it will kill me if I don't stop that : I feel the urge to stop, and it makes it so much real to write it, right now !

A few days ago, I've readen the Allen's Carr book (again) to create the good mood to stop smoking. But it was a fail by the past (after a few month), and I want to add something to perform a successful project. When I think about my last attemps, I see that there is only 2 things I've not tried : medical support and being part of a community. As I want to keep the ""stop smoking is easy"" feeling in my mind, I don't want to go to the medical support as Allen Carr suggest. The community part is the last thing I have : being part of a supporting group seems to be a great idea, because I will be able to have a daily joy sharing and reading about the fact of being a non-smoker.

I will never smoke again, I want to have a free life without tobacco, and I'm really sure that I will not regret it because I realized a lot of years ago that I don't like to smoke.  I'm ready, but I know that, in the past, my fails were caused by mental addiction but NEVER because of physical addiction. I want to have a place to fight against this mental addiction with people understanding it. And like my familly and friends (smokers and non smokers) don't understand this (according to the Allen Carr's approach), you are the choosen ones !

So, the short story :

1. I've readen Allen Carr
2. I will stop smoking on 22/02/2022
3. Mental addiction is my weakness
4. I deciced to be part of a non-smoker community

My shortcomings are due to a dangerous drop in mood due to the depression and influx of regrets and angry thoughts. Consequently this leads to an outburst of anger/frustration which culminates in a cig being lit.

I managed to be smoke free around 2/3 months in two different times.

The first time I got cocky and convinced myself that I would be able to resist the will and could just go for some smokes... The second time was in August last year, I took advantage of vacations to be able to stop while not having to deal with the stress at work... But then, I failed again. In my mind, I would never be able to fully overcome the will to smoke because after some months I really hoped I didn't get urges. I guess I am just trying to find excuses because I would be able to skip the urge of smoking if I was really committed...

But here I am now.  Once again. I feel really ashamed, specially when I see the disappointment on my friends' face.. ""Didn't you quit?"". I guess not...

I want to quit but I am afraid of failing once again. I know what I have to do, but I have been unable to fully commit to my decision of quitting. Always postponing quit times.

After two times going cold turkey, I am thinking about using some helpers but I guess the true enemy is my head only... Both times were hard the first 2 or 3 weeks but then it got way easier.

Well, I will join the boat again.

But I just don't feel prepared yet to take that decision. And I feel awful about that. I need some fuel to motivate me to do that, but I just don't seem to find how to do it.

The crazy thing, I quit before, EASILY,  4 years ago. I was going through a mental health crisis, an abusive relationship, and it was manifesting itself into physical health problems. I had, at the time, convinced myself vaping was causing all of my problems and just like that, instantaneously felt empowered to quit and NEVER felt ANY physical withdrawal symptoms or cravings. nothing. I threw everything away and was completely free. Fast forward a few months and I decided to hit a friend’s vape that was “new and tasted so good” I told myself it was so easy to quit before I’m stronger than this now and it won’t affect me hitting this just once. Of course I was wrong and my newfound love of salt nic was born. I kept justifying using with my experience of being able to quit before. Here I am 4 years later and having quite the opposite experience. I cannot quit, this mysterious empowerment is nowhere to be found, the shock tactics aren’t working. I feel more desperate to quit and the least in control of myself than I have ever felt. So I decided to turn to Allen Carr’s easy method last night after resisting the urge to hit my vape for only a few hours. I get to the second chapter and he literally tells me to keep smoking. I become at war with myself, “no i have already not hit it all night i’m not going to give in”. I wake up this morning and start listening to his book again and think “it’s already not going to work because i’m not following his instructions to keep vaping like normal.” So I hit my vape in some round about logic that continuing to hit it will help me quit as he suggests? Now I just feel bad for hitting it. I just want to stop. But I’m honestly falling apart. I’m so sweaty already and irritable and stressed and I haven’t even stopped vaping yet. Aren’t these symptoms going to become so much more pronounced once it’s been 24 hours?

This is to keep a record for myself, that I can come back to whether ive succeeded or failed. Maybe I'll update with my progress

So I've been smoking regularly for nearly a year and I've decided to quit. My teeth are more yellow, I'm pretty sure my gums have receded since I stared smoking, I get tired more easily, and my acid reflux was worse than ever recently. Plus, I get almost no nicotine buzz anymore, so cigarettes are only good to satisfy the stress - lack of concentration that the need for nic creates. I want to not need or even feel the desire to sneak out for a ciggarete every afternoon. Also I understand that the later I quit the harder it will be. 

last ciggarete was on Sunday 13 afternoon

Day 1(Monday) : I was extremely irritable from the moment I woke up, something that I really did not see coming. Every little thing would annoy me, even things like how loud one of my friends is breathing  etc. I realised that and tried not to take it out on others.

Day 2: Still somewhat irritable, but a lot better than day 1 I want to believe. Also kinda weird, I started getting random  muscle twitches (mostly lower left eyelid and a leg muscle, both very mild). And got kinda worried about that so I goodled it and found that other people have had similar experiences during nicotine withdrawal. 

Other than the physical stuff I've not had any intense nic cravings yet, which is good. Only a desire that I find pretty easy to ignore 

Day 2 update: It's now 22:30 in my country. 
I went through my day, with my lessons etc and it's definitely affecting me. I find it hard to focus on the task at hand both when studying for and during the actual lessons. Also on two separate occasion when I was really bored or angry because of an argument with my brother I felt the need for a ciggarete. Was able to shake it off after a while. 
Probably now gonna finish homework till it gets too annoying to continue doing and then go to sleep




Also massive respect for people who quit after years of smoking, I can't imagine what thats like.

Anywho, so I quit and I was expecting to cough up a bunch of black crud from my lungs. I had tried quitting a few time before and after a few days not smoking I'd start coughing out these big nasty gray lungers. This time though it wasn't like that at all, instead I will periodically get the feeling like I need to clear my throat quite badly. I can never quit clear it though but on rare occasions I'll split out a very small black loogy. I've read that it's normal to do this for the first several weeks after you quit, but this has been going on for over a year and I don't know if I should be worried about this or not, like maybe it's a sign of some more serious lung damage or something. I'll probably end up seeing a doctor about it but I just want to make sure I'm not making something out of nothing.

Never thought I could quit. Had a few runs but always held on to that ""well I will smoke at a wedding"" or some other crap excuse. Would reward myself with a puff or smoke and the longest quit I made was probably a week or two. 

Tried quitting and would wake up everyday promising myself that I wouldn't smoke that day. Was waking up in the middle of the night not being able to breath. Would hate how I could tell that first smoke in the morning would make me tired and breath even worse. I hated cigarettes as much as I loved them.

I started lurking here a good 3 or 4 years before I finally quit. After the patch, gum, lozenges, and dip I decided to give chantix a try. I kept telling myself I just needed 2 days to quit and if I did that I was never going back. Drinking had to go first too. Never could have done this still drinking.

Chantix worked and I stopped taking that 2 days into my quit. I really focused on staying calm and not one pufff no matter what. It was a shitty time to quit. Family and work problems. The world went right to shit but not one puff no matter what. I told myself I would hate me forever if I didn't quit then and it was true.

The chantix wore off and I started running. On one of my first runs I twisted my ankle really bad. That panicked me because that was my go to stress relief. So I turned to food, sleep, and weed. In the first 30 days it was not one puff no matter what, but anything else went. I'd leave work at 2pm and go eat sushi and have 2 milkshakes. Take a bath and hit my vape pen until I didn't want to move and the cravings would pass.

Every craving I defeated I would get stronger and more confident. I would come in here for the first days and months and help people. If I was having a tough time helping someone else would force me to repeat my tools through typing. And typing here was like typing on my own brain too.

During the calm periods of no cravings I would really talk myself up getting ready for the next craving. In a very short period I actually craved cigarettes less than I did as a smoker. I learned quickly to shut the cravings down. There was hell at first followed by a pink cloud where everything was so awesome. Then a huge swing into massive depression with big sense of loss. This morning period was absolutely essential to make the quit permanent. No more reward smokes, no maybe when this milestone happens. My friend nictine was gone forever and it was like losing a girlfriend. A very big loss. Then the candle just had a very dull flicker for a long time. I would question why I even quit if life was going to be this dull and empty. This went on for months.

During the dark months I would have flashes of contentment , happiness, and pride like no other. They would grow longer and longer but mostly dull flickers of a candle.

 It really wasn't until a year or a year and a half ago where I felt like a non-smoker and my candle was burning bright. In that I am disgusted with the idea of me smoking, but like the smell. Occasionally an idea of a cigarette sounds good but I can't even say its a craving. There is no obsession or real desire to smoke at all. Even in stressful situations I don't even have the thought of a smoke almost ever.

The biggest advice I can give is to listen to the advice you hear in here repeatedly. Committing to not one puff no matter what is all it takes. It's hard, but simple. The demon you make up in your mind is not nearly as big as the quit itself though. So much so that its easy to fall into that trap of ""that wasn't bad for 30 days, I could smoke a pack and do that 30 days again.""

Have plans and backup plans for stress relief. Going to bed at 2pm in the afternoon with a tylenol pm and ""fuck this day"" was a good part of my toolbelt. Hanging on to the wakeups were key as well. The day might be crap but I enjoyed the hell out of those wakeups until it was. I held onto every good moment and really appreciated it because they were brief at first.

Currently have half a pouch of tobacco left, and once that's gone, I'm done.

I've been through phases with smoking. Started off with weed (hence the hand rolled) then without. Started at 5 a day, and eventually got to 15. Back down to 6-8 now. Remains of this pouch will be smoked at 4 a day until it's gone.

In hindsight, I wish I'd have quit in my late 20s, when I ended up in hospital for ten days. Not a single drag the whole time I was there. Within an hour of being out, I was smoking. Rookie move, on my part.

Incentives to quit? Apart from the obvious health benefits?

1. Girlfriend doesn't like it.
2. I have to smoke outside (see point 1) and it sucks in the winter. 
3. Her cat HATES me/the smell, when I come back in.
4. I hate the yellow staining on my fingers, and the smell that lingers on my hands/in my beard. 
5. I need more money for antique/high end replica swords.

For the past 8 years of that time, I would be a 20 a day smoker on average, so pretty heavy. I'm borderline underweight and cigarettes are a big reason for this, substituting snacks and calories for cigarettes.. 

I began my quitting journey this summer while I was living in Spain. Contemplating it for many years, half attempting it now and then.

I went into the pharmacy to get the nicotine patches to assist with cravings. Upon asking for them the pharmacist didn't seem too impressed with the product, nor my desire to use it. I asked if she had any advice...  In her broken and to the point analysis she uttered..  ""Just close your mouth"".  At first I was kinda taken aback by this... insulted almost! But over the months it has really stuck with me... I would continually come up with excuses as to why I should smoke or why now wasn't the time to give up. Even with the assistance of these supplemental nicotine products. Vaping patches, gum etc. 

She was right though. Close your mouth. Have the power to say no, have the discipline to say no and that is your path out of this. No product can give you the discipline to remove this toxic addiction. The power comes from within. 

All of this came together recently when I watched Dopesick. The show about a pharmaceutical company launching a highly addictive opiod to the market for mild pain and thereby plunging the US into an addiction crises. During this show, I left a couple times to go for a cigarette, it was outside that I came to the consensus, I am no better then these opium addicts. I too suffer from a chronic addiction to something that gives me no value and takes away from my life. 

I saw myself making the same excuses as these addicts and counted myself lucky that, of all the addiction holes to go down it is this one. One that can train me to have better discipline in saying no. To shut my mouth. 

I'm not saying don't use things to assist you giving up, each person has their own path, but what I found was that kicking the habit is a conversation we must have with ourselves and to realise, there is the person I want to be... And the person I am. The person I am will fight to be the same, but where I want to be must fight to become a reality.",23,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.998903751373291}"

I'm 44 and I vape. I've been vaping around 7 years and prior to that I smoked since I was 16. I also use Zyn pouches at work since I can't vape on duty. 

I need to get bariatric surgery as soon as possible cause a lot of health issues I have are tied to my weight. They require you to be nicotine free for 3 months and since that's the case I'd rather quit all together. 

The odds are stacked against me. I've tried quitting many ways in the past, including cold turkey. I always cave. The longest I went without nicotine once was about a month. I have a severe mood disorder that is somewhat controlled by meds and an extremely low tolerance for stress. I'm aware using nicotine can increase your anxiety but without nicotine my anxiety, irritability and anger are huge. 

As far as medication,  my options are extremely limited as my disorder is treatment resistant and I have a very hard time tolerating therapeutic doses. I've been on just about everything. Also I read a study and people with my particular disorder only have a 4% success rate in quitting. 

One good thing is I'm hopefully getting  my medical cannabis card soon and if I do, I'd like to know a way I can use cannabis to quit. Getting  it is difficult in my state though so right now it's not a sure thing.

Mind over matter will be my first thought tomorrow and the day after, because no one will put a cigarette between my lips and light it, except for me. And the new me doesn't smoke.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9920052886009216}"

We can all do it.  And remember when you pass your favorite convenience store look at who is buying cigarettes with clear eyes not wanting one and you will realize the best think you can do is quit.

I was on a beach in Thailand on a perfect day, reading a great book and watching a 30cm Gecko climb a coconut tree. I had just eaten a great meal of green curry chicken and rice.

All I could think about was that I had run out of cigarettes.

I suddenly realized the absurdity of that. It hit me with the force of a cosmic epiphany and I never wanted a cigarette after that.

After two weeks of flashes of sudden rage, and weird mental haziness, it all cleared. Two months later everything tasted better and my stamina improved.

Now I have fixed another problem in my life. Sleep apnea.

In a sleep lab, I found out a few months ago that I was only taking in 40% of the oxygen I need during the night.

For years I have been sleeping throughout the mornings. Coming home and crashing into my comfortable chair, resenting having to get up, and living my life to conserve energy.

I took easier jobs, convinced that it was burned out after my time at an abusive job. 

I have had low energy for a long time.

A few weeks ago I had surgery to widen my throat and reduce my tongue. It has been completely life changing. Instead of waking up tired, and having to choose how to spend my limited charge, I am full of energy. Losing nine kilograms definitely helps too.I am in the best shape I have been in years.

I don't frequent this subreddit. I posted the above on my personal wall in Facebook but thought it might be helpful here. Please forgive any intrusion. What is written below is to you, my fellow victims of the nicotine industry:

MY key to quitting smoking was to get so angry at the companies that engineered the perfect drug that I would never light up again without feeling like a chump. Burn Phillip Morris to the ground instead of boosting their share value. That would be a much better use of a match, and your family might just need a gofundme for your legal bills instead of your emphysema treatments. They are commiting a genocide, and this time, you are in the gas chambers turning the taps yourselves.

Long time lurker here (24M). I have been smoking since I was 17, quickly went up from a couple of ciggs a day to a pack and then 2 packs ever since covid hit. 
I have been trying to quit as long as I can remember and every failed attempt is making me weaker.
I want to quit smoking because of a number of reasons. Firstly, I have a very demanding job and taking a 15 minute smoking break after 30 minutes and the fact that my brain is not as smart as used has fucked up my performance. I have come done from being an outstanding student and then professional to down right mediocre. Plus smoking makes me really tired I am 24 but feel like a 50 year old, get tired easily and then start procrastinating instead of focusing on my career. 
My physical health is rapidly deteriorating, I have come down from being an armature strength trainer to be an absolute unhealthy fuck where I can barely run for 10 minutes and lift only a small fraction of what I could before. I either run out of stamina or stop my workout because I want a cigarette.
My sexual performance is very bad too now and I can only see cigarette as the main culprit as my performance decreased as my smoking increased. Few weeks ago when my GF of 2 years was about to leave overseas for her masters she asked me to take a pill or buy a dildo so that at least our last sex for at least an year is good…this however was not my rock bottom. Just yesterday I found at that just one week into here university she cheated on me ( again after 2 years of our relationship). She has red flags all over her since the day I met her but I still decided to pursue my relationship with her since she didn’t normally mind my bed room performance and my excessive if smoking. Now that I come to think of it, if smoking hadn’t ducked up my d*ck and my self esteem I would not have gone for her in the first place. But I guess this was the lesson learned for me. Never again. 
I will quit smoking to show my self that I love myself and I don’t need anyone else to love me. To show my self that I can overcome difficulty and be atleast as successful as I was when smoking hasn’t completely consumed my life. 
I have a stressful week ahead, just broke up with my girlfriend and cravings are going to make me want to kill myself but if I can pull through this I can do anything and this is just the motivation I need in my life. I will keep commenting on this post to update you all of my progress.
Thank you for reading and it would be highly appreciated if you could share some benefits of quitting that you observed so that I can be more motivated.",15,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.998583197593689}"

I was about a pack a day smoker for about 20 years then switched to vaping the past few years. 

My partner and I had set a quit date, for shortly after the new year. 

When that date came, I just so happen to have Covid-19, so it was easy for me the first 3 days to quit. I just pretty much slept while I isolated. 

Cravings were intense after that and I tried to quelch them by snacking on junk food. That subsided after a week or so bc I don’t want to have a weight problem after. Now I suck on hard candies. It helps a bit. 

So week 3. I had a very vivid dream I smoked 2 cigarettes in a row last night. And cursing myself that I’d have to go thru withdrawal phase all over again. 

I find the cravings aren’t as frequent but sometimes they can be really intense. 

I still drink coffee and red wine often. 

My sleep schedule is really messed up - I am so tired during the day that I sleep quite early (9pm?) and was waking up first at 2:30, then later and later. Now it’s 6:30am which is more manageable.

Quit cigs and started vaping at 21 and managed happily until about a year ago when I started getting horrendous stomach cramping / IBS symptoms and spasms in my lungs. I quit the vape for about 4 days in January using lozenges but caved and ended up back on the cigs, which didn’t affect my stomach or lungs at first. 

Now my stomach is in bits again and I know I need to quit, and that’s before I even get to the long term effects and cost. This last week has been particularly bad. I have Allen Carr’s book which I’ll be starting and the rest of the lozenges to help me on my way though I’m considering just going cold turkey instead. I’ve set a week tomorrow (21 February) as the day I quit (lots of very stressful goings on until then) so I’m positing here for accountability.

2022-02-13 02:06:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/srcqoj/relapsed_after_nearly_five_months/,Relapsed after nearly five months.,"I quit vaping and smoking nearly five months ago. The beginning was tough of course, but to be honest, the last couple weeks have been the hardest. The novelty of quitting has completely faded and I no longer get a little serotonin boost when I complete a day without nicotine. Also, none of my friends care that I can still make it through a day without smoke. I know I don't need reassurance from friends but it sucks that they think I've ""made it"" or completely quit when, in fact, I still have cravings at least weekly.

My wife was very happy that I quit because she has never been a smoker but even she seems to have forgotten that I used to smoke. I kept my old vape pen and charger ""just in case"" but forgot about it after the first couple of weeks. Last week I remembered it and had extremely bad cravings. I looked for the pen but I couldn't find it anywhere so I went to bed. I thought to myself ""Good, I'm glad I couldnt find it, now I won't want to smoke again,"". But I've had terrible cravings for at least a week. So I went to the store tonight and bought a disposable pen. It made me cough and sputter and didn't give me a very good high, not like I remember anyway. 

Also, all the people who inspired me to quit have started smoking again. Three or four of my friends quit smoking the same time I did, all of them started smoking like two weeks later and I felt completely alone in staying off nicotine. I guess it's just been tough seeing them all vape and smoke while I stay clean. I don't begrudge them for smoking, I know I'm a grown up and make my own decisions. I know I'm able to stay smoke-free all by myself, and I feel completely pathetic for relapsing and then whining on reddit.

Should I leave the dogs out just in case someone breaks in the house?

Well, you are not in the grave yet, because while the chances of being cured are low, they can be considerably increased by kicking out the bad habit.

First of all, you need to know that risk of cancer metastasis (basically a death sentence) and relapse (very likely to be a death sentence) are both significantly lower if you quit smoking. Some chemicals in cigarettes make you cancer progress faster (which could cause the tumor to have time to metasize). The treatment will not come faster if the tumor grows faster (because if it is to aggressive it will kill you), so you might as well quit. Also, the chemicals in cigarettes can cause your cancer to relapse.

Then, your general health will improve. The risk of serious complications like lung infections (because your lungs are already struggling they are worse than usual), blood clots hearth attacks, etc are considerably reduced due to your body repairing itself and a better flow of oxygen in your body.

Lastly, if you live, you do not want to waste this second chance by smoking (potentially causing death in another way).

If you are fighting the disease, you can still benefit from quitting. If you are not, then quit before you encounter it.",30,{'infect': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9809820652008057}"

It seems like every day a little child inside me was having a hissy fit every few hours screaming to get the toy he wanted. Sometimes that inner child bubbles out and I make a fool of myself, sometimes I can wrangle him in and say ""Hey we don't have to feed into those emotions right now."" A piece of advice to anyone trying to quit: notice when the tricky bastard nicotine monster is trying to get you pissed off enough to smoke. Try to catch it and recognize that's its game. What you are mad about probably wouldn't have even phased you if you were smoking.

I think I may have some latent mental illness. Or the mix of chemicals in my brain is off a bit, because after removing nicotine I went back to acting like a teenager and I'm almost 30. Really need to focus on my emotional management going forward I guess.

I have been having a really hard time. 

For me it's more of a mental than a physical need. 

I keep realizing I don't know what to do with myself if I don't smoke. I never had any passions, hobbies etc. 

I'm litterally eating, trying to study,scrolling through my phone and sleeping. 

Smoking was the only source of pleasure in my life, but now I don't even have that. I don't know what to do without it. 

Sometimes I feel like crying. I don't want to give in and smoke again. I know rationally it's bad for me, but emotionally it's hard af. My life feels empty without cigarets.

They're like an extension of myself. They've become part of my identity which is even more fucked up. 

Smoking has allowed me to socialize better (which I hate cause social anxiety, without a cigaret keeping me busy and relaxed I become a mess), coffees feel bland without it, my days feel boring without it (like am I supposed to sit down and study all day, what am I supposed to do to distract myself, just walk???), how do people eat and not smoke afterwards?, how do people wait for the bus and not smoke?, how do people get out of bed if not for the immediate pleasure of a cup of coffee and a cigaret etc. 

Everything feels excrutiatingly dull, are days supposed to be this boring? What did I do before I started smoking?

Also there's some type of stupid romanticized masculinity thing attached to it. I know it's stupid, I'm just explaining my irrational and stupid beliefs. I feel like I'm treated with some more respect than when I didn't smoke (which is probably all in my head anyway). 

It's all just so tiring and I'm afraid for the future. I don't know who I am without cigarets. 

Please somebody who's been through a similar thought process, tell me I'll get through it and find a way of life again. I wasn't happy but at least I was distracted. I already thought life was boring af before, but now life is so monotonous. I don't know what to do anymore.

We're all the same. If I could do it, you can too. Nobody's situation is unique and there are always people that succeed because they decided so, not because their situation allows them.

Remember, your addiction will never loosen up enough so that you choose that moment to quit. Your addiction will never let itself die. That's why you need to kill it.

For me, quitting meant Wellbutrin, group therapy, and no bars or restaurants for months to break my old habits. The reality is that succeeding had less to do with the “how” of my quit than the “why” – I fell in love and decided I wasn’t willing to subject myself or my sweetie to the short- and long-term costs of smoking. Find *your* reason to quit.

And you can. First you decide that you don’t want to smoke, then you decide that you’re willing to do whatever it takes to stop. Stumbling is humbling but don't let that deter you - after you screw up, clean up, learn from your mistakes and quit again. Improvise. Adapt. Overcome. Quitting was hard but worth the effort. These days it's easy.

I've always gone back though.

Secondly, when I decided to quit, I wanted a way to track my mood in a way that would be meaningful to myself, and came up with the idea of spending half hour or so at the end of the day thinking through how I felt over each day.

To that end, I decided to pick up to 3 songs that encapsulated my feelings over the course of the entire day (I kinda live for music, and like pretty much all genres), which would hopefully allow me to chart my progress.

I wasn't going to post these very short playlists until I could prove to myself that they were heading in the right direction (or even post them at all), but as I managed to drag myself out of my fugue and go for a really long walk in the glorious weather, I'm confident that today's will be completely different to days 1 & 2.

My question is for the people that used Tabex, when did you stop using it - after 21 days? 
Did you religiously follow the recommendations?
Did you use more than 21 days or bought more packages of Tabex - not as a relapse but to continue your non smoking life?
When did you feel like it was enough?
Did you have any effects when stopped?
Did you felt something strange when taking it?

I hope everyone is well and you don't mind me posting on this chat as a professional offering advice.

I am a Hypnotherapist and Life Coach (based in the UK) and I have helped clients in stopping, reducing and controlling their smoking habit over the past few years.

I have found that hypnotherapy is often sold as a a bit of wonder cure for stopping smoking, and it can be very effective for some. However, in my experience I have found that a holistic approach is more effective to a broader spectrum of people, as hypnosis alone is not going to work for quite a number of clients, as there are often underlying issues that may also need addressing, as smoking may be a vice for meeting emotional needs such as managing stress, anxieties, or social confidence to name a few. This is why I have created a programme that combines hypnotherapy with life coaching, which means that I would work with you for longer than the average hypnotherapist to ensure we find the right formula to address the behaviours and patterns relating to your habit.

I would like to invite you to read my blog and of course feel free to ask questions, and if you would like to find out more about how I may be able help you overcome/control you smoking habit then please feel free to contact me.

I would of course welcome you to join one of my programmes (more details in the blog that is linked), if you feel it is right for you, so please feel free to get in contact.

In the meantime, the best of luck with whatever methods you choose to overcome the habit :)

Best wishes

Jonathan

Now im here and it has been over 3 weeks I haven’t touch any nicotine product. It’s the longest I think without a cheat Friday night.

I even meditate and all that jazz.

Life as been significantly better on paper but I have been so down lately.
It just feels it’s just work now and no fun.

2022-02-09 14:00:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/sol3aq/10_years_since_my_last_smoke/,10 Years Since My Last Smoke,"Quitting smoking was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. Getting there was a constant struggle. I spent two years straight trying to quit and relapsing. Started when NC banned indoor smoking in 2010, didn't manage to finally kick the habit until 2012. Over the two years I managed a few weeks here and there. Sometimes getting up to a month or two before relapsing. Once I even made it 6 months before picking up a box of cigars on a whim.

The final straw was after a bad breakup and I found myself smoking three packs in one day. The next day I woke up went to the store bought a fresh pack, smoked one, felt disgusted and ran water over the rest of the pack.

Ended up getting nicotine patches and gum to help wean myself off of nicotine. The gum was necessary at first since my nicotine tolerance had gotten out of control and the largest dose patch just wouldn't cut it. Then slowly I got down to just the patch after a few days.

I was still an emotional wreck and decided I needed a new setting or else I was just going to smoke again. So I sold and donated all my possessions, and got my parents to help me sell my house while I was gone. I bought a 1 way Amtrak ticket out west. Spent the next week just riding trains, staring out the window of the countryside passing by.

Went down a level on my patch on the morning I had a layover at Union Station in Chicago. Ended up killing time by applying to jobs in states from Wyoming to Washington along the Empire Builder route. Got my first call back while I was still on the train for a position in Missoula, Montana so I got off at Whitefish.

I didn't get that job but I ended up puttering around Missoula long enough to rent a month to month apartment with the idea I'd head out once I landed a job elsewhere. During this time I would cough my lungs out every night. It was absolutely horrible. Went to the doctor and ended up with codeine cough syrup for how bad my throat looked. The doctor said, ""If you can manage to not smoke cigarettes anymore you should be fine with not getting addicted to the cough syrup."" 

For the next year it was hell not smoking anymore. I had super senses, whenever I had the slightest whiff of tobacco smoke it would set me off. The guiding principle I kept repeating in my head was, ""You only feel this bad because of the last cigarette you smoked, having another is only going to make you feel worse all over again. Tomorrow will be a better day.""

I ended up finding my dream career in Missoula but my addiction almost ruined it. For a few years there would be smokers outside my office where quite often I could smell tobacco smoke while I worked. It drove me crazy, almost to the point of quitting. Eventually though, after about 3 years, second hand smoke stopped bothering me.

So many times I've been tempted to start smoking again. Some times during stressful life events, some times during the happiest. But I know even one puff would have me back to smoking two packs a day within a few weeks.

The best advice I can give is to just keep trying. Every quit attempt teaches you more and more about your relationship to nicotine. I think Alan Carr's Easy Way book is mostly right, but there needs to be more empathy towards our failings. Every failure is an opportunity for growth. Just keep trying and you will get there.",166,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9991708993911743}"

2022-02-09 11:20:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/sohf0j/how_i_stopped_smoking/,How I stopped smoking,"Hi all, my name is Mattan, I live in Melbourne Australia, and  I stopped smoking on the 2nd of December 2017, at 1:20 am (yes, I know the exact date and time, that’s part of the tools I use for not smoke ever again), after smoking for 18 years. I took part in a challenge that inspired me to write what I did and the tools I used to stop smoking, and now I hope it might inspire someone else to stop smoking as well. And yes, I didn’t quit smoking, I stopped smoking. The word quit has a negative connotation for me, so I choose not to use it. to stop something is neutral, it's just something you do, like stopping at a stop sign while driving. It's a very big deal to stop smoking, but I found out that by reducing the importance of the act, you don't need to dwell on it all the time, and just carry on with your life, and that's the best thing to do.

So here is my story of how I stopped smoking:

&#x200B;

1. I prepared for it. I set a date, a good two weeks in advance, and not just went cold turkey on the spot. I’ve tried that before, never worked for long. The reason I did that was to give myself a couple of weeks to “say goodbye.” Those were some of the most enjoyable cigarettes of my life, both because I was “there"", present at the moment, and also because I found myself eagerly waiting for the moment when I could stop smoking. Every time I light up a cigarette, I found myself thinking “Only 8 days to go”, “Only 36 more cigarettes to go”.
2. I made a whole ceremony out of it. I usually only smoked in one spot in my house, by one of the windows, so I cleaned the rest of the house before, had clean sheets on my bed, a fresh towel ready, and when the time came, I set down and smoked the last cigarette of my life with my full attention on the moment. No music, no drink, no one else around, just me and it.
3. I made myself a souvenir, something to remind myself of the day I became a nonsmoker. I cut the lid out of the last packet I bought and wrote on it the date and time of the exact moment I put out the last cigarette I ever smoked. I still have it, hanging on my fridge by a magnet that has the writing “Do Not Forget” written on it.
4. I cleaned that spot thoroughly, and then I threw out (almost) everything I had that related to smoking. My remaining cigarettes, my ashtray, even all the lighters I had. I did keep a humidor with some cigars I had, which much later I regrettably gave to a friend, but as I said, I regret it and think it was wrong and just made it harder for me, having that humidor around as a temptation (my friend also stopped smoking by now and I told them to throw it out). After I finished throwing all that stuff out (I literally went out to the dumpster, I didn’t just bag it and waited for the trash to get full), I cleaned myself – took a long shower, washed the smoke and the smoking away, and then went to bed knowing that I am a nonsmoker from now until the end of times.
5. I had a hard time. It took me months to stop feeling the urge to smoke on a daily basis, and at first, it was much more than just daily. I think the physical aspect of the addiction wasn’t that hard, although I did definitely feel it (I heard some say that the physical withdrawal is so small you don’t feel it), but the psychological aspect of the addiction was very hard to quiet down. I came to the conclusion that I used to smoke mainly when I was bored or needed an excuse for a break from what I was doing, not because I wanted to smoke. I think there were very few times when I actually enjoyed the cigarette itself.
6. I came to learn that “this too shall pass.” I learned that the flareups I had in my desire to smoke usually lasted for two, maybe three minutes before they dyed down. They were at different levels of intensity, but they never lasted long. In the beginning, when I had those flareups I didn’t ignore them or carried on with what I was doing. I stopped, I acknowledged what was happening, and I found something to keep me occupied until it passed. I got a couple of glasses of water, I got up and organized my space a little, I played a quick game of “2048” on my phone, I did something to keep my hands busy and my mind focused on something else.
7. I usually have a piece of paper in my hands that I roll around over and over or fold and unfold and fold again. I’ve always had a problem keeping my hands quiet, and cigarettes were something to do, so I replaced them with pieces of paper. I heard some use cinnamon sticks for that, so they can also raise it to their mouth, but papers were easier for me, I just replace the piece I use every time I wear it down.
8. I put distance between myself and smoking. At the start, it was also a physical distance. I had the privilege to do it, so for the first three weeks to a month after I stopped smoking, I kept my distance from smokers, even if it meant not seeing friends, colleagues, and family, to lower my temptations. Every smoker in my life was more than cool with it, by the way, and they totally understood why I needed to stay away for a while. But I also created a mental and emotional distance, by being aware of how I thought and changing it. Instead of thinking “I want a smoke,” I change it to “I think I want a smoke,” or “I think I want to light up a cigarette.” I always look for a way to phrase the thought with as many words as possible between “I” and “smoking.” It took a while for it to not feel stupid doing so, but I think that’s one of the best tools I came up with to help me. By adding more words to the thought, by putting more distance between me and the cigarette in my thoughts, I manage to put distance between the physical me and the physical cigarette.
9. I remember that there’s no such thing as “just one” cigarette. I’ve done the math, and I know it’s not one cigarette, it’s 10,950. 10 cigarettes a day for the next three years, as before that was usually the time it took me between “quitting” tries. This time I didn’t quit, I stopped, and I know that even the one is too much for me. I also did the money math, and cigarettes lose on that front as well.
10. It took a while, but the number of times I crave a cigarette has fallen dramatically, as the habit became obsolete, and I found other ways to fill my time. Even today I still have those moments when I find myself craving a cigarette, but they are few and far between, and with the tools I developed for myself, their easier to handle when the feeling comes.

&#x200B;

Something that I think was very helpful for me was telling that I plan to stop smoking to people I knew would fully support me without judgment, and more importantly, not telling those I knew could make me question myself and my resolve. If you want to support a smoker in your life while they try to stop, believe in them and don’t judge. That’s pretty much all they need from you, but you need to make it clear to them, on a constant basis, that they have it.

Some of this I picked up from Alan Carr’s book ""The Easy way to stop smoking"", and some from a Stop Smoking class that was held by the health service provider I was with at the time, free of charge. I stopped smoking for a few months with the book, and even though it wasn’t the end of the struggle for me I do recommend it, it has good info and tools. The class I went to was indeed the catalysator for me, and I highly recommend going to one if you have access to it, but it wasn’t free of problems as well, as I felt that the guy running it kept pushing the drugs they had to offer to help in the process. I have no objection to drugs if they are needed, whatever works, and if I would’ve failed, I would probably go that way the next time I tried quitting, probably three years later. I just chose to not use them, and it felt that they were the main solution on offer in the class.

She was 70 years old and had smoked all her life. She had COPD, and her doctor found a spot on her lung during a routine check up. Her options were to undergo surgery to remove part of her lung or start chemo in case it was cancerous. 

She chose surgery, and we all backed her. She wasn't in the best of health, but she was by no means frail. She gardened, worked two days a week, and cared for her mother-in-law. The stress test prior to surgery came back fine. 

We were all nervous, but she came through the surgery great. On the second day of recovery, she felt short of breath and asked to be put in a ventilator. They agreed so she could heal a bit, and the plan was to wean her off over a few days. Obviously, she had to be heavily sedated while on the ventilator. 

But a few days turned into a few weeks. Every time they tried to wean her off, her oxygen would drop. They did a scan and discovered that she had a Widowmaker clot in her heart, making it nearly impossible to wean her off of sedation. Each time they tried, her heart rate would skyrocket because she was confused and afraid, yet not alert enough to be comforted. The doctors were stuck. They needed to get her off the ventilator. They needed to perform heart surgery. None of it was safe to do, and it all kept piling on top of the rest.

Sometimes, she broke through the sedation and began ripping the tubes from her body, so she was restrained to the bed. I wasn't there, but my mom and aunt have both told me that sitting with her was the most traumatic thing they've ever gone through. They described the terror in her eyes, and they couldn't do anything to help. 

Three weeks later, while still on the ventilator, my grandmother had a massive stroke which left her brain dead. It broke our family. While it broke my heart to lose her, my heart was doubly broken to see how distraught her violent, painful, and scary death had left her own children. They watched their mom suffer to death, and the hurt was different because of that. It was more than sadness at losing a parent. It really was trauma. They had nightmares for months. My mom still can't sleep properly. 

The second I knew she had passed, I knew I had to quit smoking. It stopped being something I should try to do and became something I would do. I saw how traumatized my family was, and I just knew I couldn't do that to them again. I've never experienced something hitting me as an undeniable fact like that, but it simply became the truth. I was going through some intense things at the time, so I chose to put it off for a couple of months until I knew I'd have settled down. And then, I did it. 

I've tried to quit a thousand times. I smoked heavily for 12 years, and I often said that cigarettes were my favorite thing. Honestly, they still are. I'd love to go have a smoke right now. I miss it often. 

But it's not a controlling factor of my life anymore. It's like any other addiction--it doesn't stop. You learn to control it. I wanted to tell you guys that you can learn to control it. I hope it doesn't take something as awful as it took for me, but honestly, it might. That's how addiction works. 

Anyway, I never thought I would quit. I didn't think it was possible. Life handed me a really good reason, and I took it. I bet you have a really good reason, too.",9,{'ventilator': 4},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9967615008354187}"

But it’s not that simple. When folks see the non smoking train, they assume (sometimes) that it’s just a ride like any other, with a departure and a destination, with determined stops and changes at certain days and times. 

It’s not like that. Everyone is so unique, that all one can say in earnest, is that it definitely is a method of transportation from one bad addiction to a lifetime ride of freedom of the same. 

It only has one rule. You don’t smoke. You are a passenger on a train that doesn’t have a destination. 
And it doesn’t judge the way you feel. 

Just remember that every one won’t see it the same all the time, but we all collectively can keep it on track. 

If you feel bad on a day that you think someone else didn’t ?  That doesn’t matter or mean shit. I gakked up stuff a week ago out of nowhere, after I thought I had cleared it out.

Hello,

Excessive craving for alcohol, tobacco, or high-calorie foods is a central symptom of addiction and is involved in serious secondary disorders such as obesity, diabetes, and liver damage. Reducing craving is therefore an important goal in addiction treatment. Building upon the approach bias modification paradigm by Mike Rinck and Eni Becker, our research group developed and tested a modified technique, imaginal retraining, in participants who report problematic alcohol use, tobacco use, and obesity. Positive effects were statistically detectable but rather weak, as were the effects of the original technique (the approach bias modification paradigm; results can be found here: [https://clinical-neuropsychology.de/retraining-a-method-to-reduce-alcohol-consumption/](https://clinical-neuropsychology.de/retraining-a-method-to-reduce-alcohol-consumption/)

We have now combined our modified technique, imaginal retraining, with another behavioral technique, decoupling, which in numerous studies has shown efficacy in body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs) such as trichotillomania and nail biting. Addiction and BFRBs have some symptomatic overlap but do not necessarily occur together. Because of this, we were uncertain whether the combination would have additive effects. In a recently completed study of 227 people with problematic alcohol use, we succeeded in reducing participants’ craving for alcohol by more than one third. We know that this sounds too good to be true. We therefore invite you to try the modified protocol at [www.uke.de/craving](https://www.uke.de/craving) that combines the two techniques. Before performing the new technique (called P3, which stands for pull, pause, push) please study the original manual, imaginal retraining, which you can also find at [www.uke.de/craving](https://www.uke.de/craving). This illustrates the theoretical background of the technique. **The technique is generic and can be easily adopted to smoking behavior.**

Your experiences with the combined technique are important to us. Please write to [moritz@uke.de](mailto:moritz@uke.de) or post a comment below. However, we suggest you test the method for yourself before jumping into the discussion",10,{'symptomatic': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9801048636436462}"

I made a pact with my mother who has been cigarette free for 8 years and nicotine free for 3 years. She still uses a vape with no nicotine as it seems the hand to mouth oral fixation seems to be her mental compromise to keep her off the tobacco all this time. I must say I am very proud of her as, like myself, has quite the addictive personality. A little background: She with my father were on hard drugs for I wanna say 15 years before children and a few years into parenthood but both wised up and quit them.  Alchohol now is her only substance to abuse which comes with peaks and valleys of usage. I myself became a booze hound around 24 and drove that train for eight years.

I chose the latter and have been booze free for 2 years. Now I think it's time to tackle the ciggys. My mother is always trying to start pacts with me, weather it's working out, dieting, or other life augmenting decisions that require conviction, motivation and commitment. I never agree to these pacts as I have always thought that pacts such as these are doomed from the start and always end with one person disappointing the other. I'd say things like ""if you really wanted such change then you would do it yourself and lead by example. Not hold others accountable for your actions and vice-versa."" Well now that ideal has changed in me lol. I thought with the fact that she has been off nicotine for almost a decade now and myself off the booze with NO desire to drink EVER again maybe entering a pact with her might be a neat idea as she is tightly held by booze and I by the cigs. I've been suggesting that the day after her birthday in a couple months I'd quit smoking if she'd quit drinking. She has begrudgingly warmed to the idea and I'm quite excited yet nervous so I'm seeking advice. I wanna quit using some sort of vape system with a waining nicotine plan. I've half heartedly tried in the past but gave up as the vape would always be harsh and unfulfilling plus was a chore to maintain. What are some good vape styles for someone who is quite sensitive to the jucies and doesn't really care for the flavors? Would getting a flavor that's close to the sensation of a cigarette be beneficial and if so what are the options? Anything helps.

It's also hard with ZYN because it's so clean, discrete, easy, relatively not harmful, and cheaper. It's much harder to be glad the habit is over when it's nicotine's greatest form. I don't miss, vaping or smoking, although I had my time with those... Just ZYN.

From the moment I became addicted to cigarettes I wanted to quit. But I also became addicted when I was 20, and life was panning out to be much more difficult than I originally thought. Stress, anxiety, and eventually a deep depression set in and cigarettes became my main coping mechanism.

That is  when the addicted brain takes over. We keep telling ourselves, ""of course you're going to quit. But obviously you can't quit right now! Look at how crazy and difficult things are! Could you imagine quitting smoking on top of everything else that is going on?""
That is how our addicted brain manipulates us! I kept telling myself I would quit eventually, but just not right now... Maybe when things get a little less stressful...

Well, exactly one year ago, I had smoked the last cigarette from the pack, and it was early in the day. I knew I would need to put on some more warm clothes, my big heavy rain boots, grab an umbrella, make sure I had a lighter. I'd have to walk in the cold wind and rain. I would have to hand my €7 to that same guy who I saw every day. The walk from the corner store to my house was about two-thirds of a cigarette. So I would probably walk the long way around the block so I could finish that cigarette. I'd walk inside and think, ""that cigarette wasn't so good."" So might have walked directly to my back garden and smoke a second. Eventually, I'd convince myself that I'd enjoy my sext cigarette with a little buzz on... And so it would go. By 5pm I would be drinking beer and smoking cigarettes until one ran out.

But I didn't buy that pack. Instead I went to this sub! I read your stories, I took a deep breath, and I said, ""I quit smoking."" I spent the €7 I would have spent on a pack on the stop smoking app. 

Today is my 365th day without a cigarette. It wasn't always easy. But I promise it's worth it!!! I am so happy that I quit smoking and I couldn't have done it without this community.

For those who don't like hearing about the grubby yuck of sputum, probably best you dont read this post. Tl;dr below.

I quit smoking about 5 months ago, its been a time and I'm very glad I've maintained no smoking in this time. When I quit my lungs went through the usual cycle of self-cleaning, I began coughing up lots of dark gunk in my mucus, like 90% dark material. It was alarming to see but my doctor told me this was the normal process, given how heavily I was smoking before suddenly quitting. 

The amount of gunk reduced over the following 3 months until I eventually stopped coughing up gunk all together, sometimes having clear mucus. 

Recently I've started hocking up more mucus again, I'm not sure what has caused it to come back, but Ive been noting increasing amounts of dark material turning up in my mucus. Not a lot, but each time I've hocked up something theres been a little more each time. 

Has anyone else had a kind of 'second round,' of lung flux happen like this? Or should I be concerned this is a sign of respiratory problems like lung cancer? I'm booking in to see my doctor again, it has been difficult to get appointments due to covid 19, I thought I might ask to see if this was something that had happened to others who have quit smoking after a long period of heavy smoking for around 2 years.

Tl;dr

I have started to cough up brown flecks in my mucus for a second time after quitting smoking 5 months ago, is this something I should be concerned about or is this normal?",1,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9975142478942871}"

I’m going to share my own opinions of this journey for y’all because this was my favorite part reading yours and it helped me to see things in my own life to help me.

Smoking is not one thing for me. Some were great some were terrible and most cigarettes(99%) were completely unmemorable and just  an addiction .

Great - 

The ones that gave me the 5 minute break excuse from responsibility (family/work) when I needed to walk away.  

The ones that I smoke after smoking weed or beer seemed to just be different maybe it’s the multiple vices being naughty I don’t ducking know. 

The one talking through problems with a friend on a smoke break.  Be real smokers best friends are other smokers.  

The Bad -

Smoking in the rain - at no point doesn’t it suck
Smoking in the snow - ditto
Smoking in the cold -  this is the one that got me to start this quit
Coughing and needing to use Inhaler ever during or after smoking  
Getting off a plane ready to kill the world for a smoke even more then starting vacation.
O
Every experience missed. By the five minutes out of every hour you waste smoking . 

Every reason I I tell myself smoking is great is bullshit it’s an excuse to be put in time out for 5 min or 100 min a day. And even if 2  were great am I willing to  have 90 min of wasted  time chasing.

I've been more or less fine so long as I don't go aroundy coworkers when they smoke. And I thought she was fine too, but the last two weeks her cravings have been hell. And ever since the end of the first month they've been coming back and slowly getting worse and worse.

I am planning on doing a 3 day fast, starting from tomorrow, and trying to quit vaping (20mg Nicotine). A few years ago I tried quit cigarettes, and after multiple failed attempts, I found that doing a fast along side trying to quit seemed to work best for me. I did however then start vaping 3 months later and justified my usage be saying to my self its not as bad as cigarettes. But now I'm trying to quit again because it still effects my cardio and from what I have recently heard about nicotine's affect on dopamine sensitivity.

I have practised long fasts for a while as I just find it a great way to reset bad habits if my lifestyle is becoming out of sync, e.g. to much partying; drinking too much, bad sleeping cycle, no exercise, being lazy. I do not fast for weight loss, I'm a 5ft 5 male who weighs 62 kg, every kilogram lost is a tragedy XD. I normally do a 24 hr fast once a month but I have done 3 day fasts prior to this one and even a 5/6 day fast before. It is not fun. 

Just wanted to make this post to ask if anyone has found the same benefit from using fasting to help them quit nicotine? or if anyone knows of any research in this area?

So I quit when I got back to my apartment. When the physical cravings were the worst, I had no money to buy a vape, not even enough for a pack of cigs. The first round of exams is starting, and I’m *stressed* to the point where all I think about is smoking. I’m pretty sure the ADHD meds make the cravings worse, too. 

I really thought it would be better at this point. Even knowing I’ve saved $90 in just 2 weeks isn’t helping. Plus, the dry mouth and mucus have started back up. So I’m having the side effects of smoking without actually smoking. Sometimes I feel like the only reason I’ve maintained my quit is because I’m too lazy to go buy anything. It’s scary to think I might slip the next time I have to go to a gas station.

2022-02-04 18:15:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/skrgoh/dealing_with_feeling/,Dealing with Feeling,"Not understanding how to deal with feelings, I stuffed them back down with each inhale of smoke. Sometimes I blew smoke at whatever was causing the problem out there somewhere. They caused me to be angry or upset. I was the victim here. Everyone else made me feel one way or another. Smoking and pointing the finger out there to blame others was my reaction to what was happening around me. It wasn't clear that I was responsible for my feelings. 

Today, nicotine-free, I am learning how to deal with my feelings. I become aware of where emotions settle in my body. I find the physical sensation, often in my belly, heart or throat. Stopping whatever I'm doing and breathing into the sensation, I try to name the feeling. I allow myself to fully feel the sensation, while quieting my mind. It's okay to have feelings. There is no blame, but I'm accountable for my part. When I'm ready, I can return to whatever I was doing. 

For example, often tightness in my belly signals anger. Once I can get quiet and really feel the sensation and breathe into it, the sensation eases, I accept that I got angry. Yes, my mind wants to go over and over and over the scenario where I got angry. Instead of blaming everyone else, I look at my part of the situation. I repeatedly bring my attention back to my breathing, and accept that I got angry and it's okay.  

Like any feeling, anger arises. We are human, and feeling feelings is very human. It's what I do with the feeling, my reaction to it that matters. I used to light up to numb my feelings. Now I practice feeling the feeling, accepting it, and letting it go. I'm not perfect at it all the time, and that's okay. I'm human and beautifully imperfect!",8,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9094161987304688}"

I am coming off NRT(nicorette patches gum spray used for 1 year)and was a smoker for around 3 years on and off.


Here are some ideas:

-drink a glass of cold water( or maybe with some zero sugar syrup added to it).Also keeps you hydrated and helps with bowel movements.( for real)

-drink a cup of  bitter black coffee, it 'll boost your mood and focus and you'll make better decisions.

-breathe deep a few times(10 times let s say) and imagine your better self,healthier self.

-try to take some fresh air(outside or even out of your window) and tell yourself you  want to be free of any addiction, think about why you're doing this.

-chew some normal gum

-wash your face/teeth  or take a  slow shower to soothe yourself

-eat a fruit( crispy cold apple from fridge or banana)

-make a cup of your fav tea(explore teas and flavours) and drink it in silence, maybe with a self help book( just 5 minutes of reading while u sip your tea,its enough to restore your mood and reframe your point of view)

-if you have a cat or a dog or any pet,play with them a bit,talk to them,pet them.It's amazing how much happier and peaceful you'll feel.

-Journal a bit or search for inspiring content online.Doodle/sketch /get some adult coloring book.As long as you find it relaxing,do it.

-start learning a new language or skill(to keep you distracted and engaged in something meaningful)

-Donate some money to charity(whatever you find meaningful, for kids/pet rescue/people with illness) just donate a small amount and think that you did a good thing instead of spending that money to fullfill your little addiction...

-buy food for 5-10 euro let's say and donate it to local charities,set a day (let s say once a month) and make a  habit for it.

-engage in a hobby/ do something you like...art/music/ sewing/video games/your fav youtube channel....whatever you find fun.That will fill up your mind and you won't need to think about nicotine.

-start a research habit on a topic you re passionate about.If you like  anything in life, see if you can dive deeper into that topic.

-start another healthy habit like maybe skincare (this one is the best!! I started to religiously take care of my skin and teeth, applying various serums and SPF, went to dentist for a general clean/ plaque cleaning and bit of whitening, flossing my teeth.I never skip my skin ritual now it makes me feel proud i do it.(plus the results are already visible!)  

-cooking healthier recipes/or trying different foods,spices,international cuisine... baking...after you stop smoking your taste and smell receptors become more sharp so things will taste better in general!

-decluttering your house/ wardrobe.cleaning... in general gives a sense of peace and control and a clean environment motivates you on all aspects of life.

- buy flowers for living room,light a candle, redecor your space.Plants,pillows, aromatherapy(oils or scented sticks).You'll have a nice ordered smelling house which will reflect on how you want to be.

-Wear nice perfumes, moisturize your body, get some nice shower gel and scrub...You'll smell nice and you'll feel clean and fresh.Especially for women but also for men.Smelling nice and being clean is more attractive than smelling like tobacco(aka garbage...)

Most importantly,be gentle to yoursef during this time.You are healing from an addiction so you must soothe yourself along the way.
Allow room for grief of an old gone habit and embrace the new, with small steps and small wins.Even as an adult we still need to take care of ourselves like we would take care of someone we love.

I hope something from this post can be useful for someone out there.Stay healthy, safe, and take care of yourselves folks.This will pass.There are many many beautiful and important things out there to focus on,so let's embrace that path!

What I am confused about is - where do these estimations come from? The only things it asked me were the number of cigarettes per day and how soon in the morning I would smoke the first one. It doesnt know how long I had been smoking.
Surely, these stats and percentages are not the same if you smoked one year or ten?

This time as hard as it is to accept I can't even have a puff, I know there is no going back. It is so hard at times. Some mornings I wake up wanting nothing but to have that morning cig but I know it will be the start of another miserable journey of smoking. 

It is hard to resolve and resist so many triggers on a daily basis but I am stronger for it and finally, after so long, I feel proud of myself. 

I wish everyone the best fighting the little addict in them. We are bigger than the addict and will prevail ❤️",27,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9843633770942688}"

Smoking gives me an excuse to step out and breath. 

I can step out and breath anyway. I don’t have to smoke. I can just give myself a break, and not be killing myself while I’m at it.

I successfully quit for 7 years once, but have been on and off for a while. I’ve realized just one drag— is enough to completely set me back. The “just one more”, has kept me going for months.

My health is compromised. I absolutely have to stop if I want to be healthy again.

I can’t keep doing this. I’ve rationalized it cause of stress, but it adds so much stress with the impact to my health.

Years ago when I had been quit for years, I was sexually harassed at a workshop— when I tried to call it out, I was attacked, and kicked out of the community. It really impacted me. I felt like being a woman made me basically meaningless in many instances, and smoking felt like I was giving the middle finger to all of that. It was something I could control, cause I can’t control the rest.

I still get that sense of control from it. Like society can force me to accept sexual harassment, but it can’t force me to quit smoking. 

But society doesn’t care.

The only people that care are those that love me, and it hurts them.

Cravings with step 1 have been very mild and manageable. I definitely WANT to stay quit and want to get off nicotine altogether but find myself a little anxious about the coming change.

However, it feels… different this time. (I know I know, but hear me out). I feel like this time, I have more of my ducks in a row.

Over the past couple of years I have: a)cut out alcohol and weed completely b)started meditating, yoga, breathwork, ice baths, float tank, you name it c)started regularly exercising d)cut off toxic people and relationships and e)finally started therapy. I started all these things as recovery from alcoholism, actually. 

I wasn’t even thinking of quitting last month, I was planning on springtime…but then I got a (mild) case of Covid and I didn’t smoke one morning… then tried it for a few more hours, kept myself busy for a few more, white-knuckled a craving after dinner, and went to bed. Once I realized I had 24 hours, I just kept going. 

So now it’s been over two weeks and I’m breathing better. Workouts are great and I have a lot more energy and time to get stuff done. I’m sleeping better, which is HUGE. I feel fucking fantastic. I have an open pack of cigarettes on my desk and I look at them and feel nothing, perhaps a little disgust.

In the past I have tried quitting cold turkey but oh my goodness do I become so insanely depressed and sad. Even when life is ""good"" I feel like I have zero dopamine going on up there. That's why I knew I needed to try something like NRT because I simply just couldn't do the cold turkey deal. 

Thankfully the NRT is working quite well. I've been using these lozenges for about a month and have worked my way down to only using about 2 lozenges a day and it really hasn't been TOO bad (it has still obviously sucked to some extent, LoLz). 

However, yesterday I was feeling confident and decided that since it's been a month of weening myself down to very little nicotine, I should be ok with not using any lozenges anymore. Fast forward to today and I don't really have cravings or physical symptoms but I feel so hopeless and extremely depressed and angry... So I popped a lozenge in and I'm feeling mostly better. Ta da!!

My question for those who have done NRT is... how long did you really have to do NRT before you weren't reliant on it anymore? I want so badly to keep progressing forward, and perhaps too quickly.

But day 6 and 7 I woke up with strong depressed feelings almost as of I’d just gotten dumped in high school or something. 

Anyway - I wonder if anyone went on Wellbutrin to try to seal the deal of quitting and/or deal with low mood or cravings, after they’d managed to quit for a short while. Because it takes time to get onto Wellbutrin, and I guess to get off again, not sure if it’s necessary but … yeah week two is hard so far.

That was six years ago and actually I wanted to quit on several occasions in that time, but there was always something more important or I was too stressed or it wasn't the right time (which it really wasn't), but now I feel like enough is enough.

I've been wanting to quit since months now, but I was suuupeeeer stressed with work and so on. But I just finished a big project on Sunday and I promised myself I would quit after it was done, so today's the day. 

I got meself the nice Smoke Free App, wrote a list of reasons why I want to quit into my addiction diary and researched some phone numbers and online counceling stuff for quitting. I don't think that it'll be too hard as I already reduced my smoking over the years, but the first days are gonna be brutal.. So, if you have any tips, you're more than welcome to share them! I also have a bit of a sweet tooth and when I quit drinking half a year ago I constantly munched on all kinds of sweets and gained some kilos, I'd like to avoid that this time. I got meself some ginger and I'm planning to chew on it if I get cravings, but I don't know if that works lol.

I don't know what more to tell. Maybe this: Looking forward to being a non-smoker!

Every fiber of my being wants to be done, but I still want to inhale poison.","I know the question boils down to - ""are you going to smoke forever or are you going to stop right now, no more puffs?""

It's only been two hours, but already it's killing me. Then again, all having a smoke would do is put it off for half an hour when I get the first and weakest craving. I find the one at roughly two hours the worst for a while, but the one at five hours is the one I tend to give in to. But Not Today. 

It will be the hardest when my child gets home from school and we need to go do errands. I promised her we would. But how do I want to do these errands, sucking in poison before hopping in a car with her, breathing that stale ashtray breath in the car, or clean lungs after freshly brushing my teeth.

There was so much anxiety leading up to quitting. I was nervous for months. I agonized. The first three months were awful and at the beginning of a global pandemic. But I did it! I stuck with it. It got easier and I hardly think about smoking at all anymore, even though my husband still smokes. I forgot it was two years today but I got some reminders from family members. 

I smoked over a pack a day for 22 years and I LOVED smoking. It’s funny how different my life is now. Smoke free, 85lbs lighter, and a runner. 

Quitting smoking changed my life and was worth the struggle. 

I hope anyone who is struggling today sees this and it helps them keep going. I promise it gets better and that you can do this. Keep at it friends!",96,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9853459596633911}"

I would imagine some people here have went through the exact same thing. If so, how did you get through it? Would you recommend buying a disposable e-cig just for that night? Would it do the job? (I'm not worried about getting addicted to e-cigs, never been a fan of them anyway).

I quit smoking approximately 2 and a half weeks ago. and I had a very productive and peaceful quitting experience until yesterday. One old friend invited me to drink at his house. I accepted it. I was very ""confident"" that I would never smoke cigarettes because I was a happier person without them, I truly believed it. He was a smoker and we drank indoors. The room got filled with smoke(that disgusting smell) Because I had not been drinking for 2 years, I forgot how it used to impair my judgment. Well, I got tempted and smoked one near the end of the drinking session(When the depressing effects of alcohol kicked in) and then another and another...

Now I have this feeling of despair like I am never going to be free of this addiction... I have this feeling of frustration about myself. And I am thinking how foolish that decision was... . And the thought of going through the withdrawal again kind of makes me depressed. But I want to try again, I can't give up. I hate the cigarettes.

Now if you guys have any positive reinforcements or motivational words for me, I will be more than happy to hear them.

Thank you, guys. I hope everybody gets freed of this addiction hell.",14,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.590610682964325}"
