Vape-to-patch,"I smoked for 7 years and quit 4 years ago and have been vaping ever since, 3mg/ml PG/VG.  For those not familiar with vapes, this is pretty much the lowest level of nicotine.  1ml of liquid creates a lot of vapor so if you manage to get 3mg in 15 minutes it's a lot.  

Unfortunately the smallest dose of patches are 7mg, so the first time I tried one it didn't last 5 minutes before I was flying and had to rip it off.  Not only do they come on too strong but they wear off too fast.  After 12 hours they're totally spent and I need a new one.  It says 24 hours but....

Now I can be a mentally fragile person, I have been emotionally unstable in the past. However, the last 3-4 months I've been exercising a lot and really enjoying life in general, even with lockdown. My marriage is strong and I've spent most days feeling optimistic and productive. Now I feel scared of losing my mental balance over this drug.

I can't tell if these side effects are genuine or just a result of my own paranoia after reading about the side effects prior to starting Champix - I've only just started and maybe it's too soon to tell! But I read about some horrible stuff people experience and spent most of last week in fear over it. If it wasn't for my doctor constantly ringing to check up on whether I'd started Champix, I probably wouldn't have started. Now I'm on it and keep feeling a sense of impending doom.

It took me maybe 3-4 years to reach the point where i could say I never want to smoke again, no matter what the situation is, and actually believe it in. My Ex went back to smoking after 10 years. When asked, I advice ex-smokers to adopt the same acceptance as of ex alcoholics, that you'll be an ex smoker for a long time, and not become complacent about ""just one for old times sake"". Numbers will vary, if you smoked only for a few years you have a better chance of kicking the habit for good much quicker.

New here! I’ve read through a bunch of posts and this looks like a great place to find support from others going through their quitting journeys. 

This is my second stint of smoking. I had quit for 2.5 years at one point. I started again when I started a restaurant job where you basically didn’t get a break if you didn’t smoke! It’s been about 9 years since I restarted the habit. 

I have pretty bad anxiety, so on top of feeling like this is going to be a difficult thing to do, I’m worried my anxiety will get worse. Although logically, it should eventually get better without cigarettes in my life. 

Those of you who have quit, can you please list off the positives? I have a feeling I’ll need to look through them tomorrow to remember why I am doing this. I have a list of my own specific reasons for quitting, but if you have any physical/mental positive changes that you’ve noticed since quitting (whether you’ve early or further into your quitting journey), that would be helpful to read through!

I started smoking when I was 15 and finally quit when I was 30.  I managed to make it seven years almost to the day when I started vaping with a mod.  I noticed my lung function is down and it raises my anxiety, plus I know it’s not good for me, so I have set my quit date for September 4th, my mom’s birthday (both of her parents died from lung cancer so I figured it would be fitting).  I can already see a major roadblock coming up and need advice from anyone who has been able to overcome it. 

When I quit smoking one of the things that helped me was that I could only do it at certain times, like breaks at work.  I ended up signing up for a shit ton of overtime the first week, knowing that if I was chained to my desk I just had to resist the urge during breaks and lunches.  I work at home now due to Covid, and since vaping doesn’t make your house reek like cigarettes do and I can do it in my house, I basically vape all fucking day.  I do it constantly while I’m working, watching TV, even while I’m cooking dinner.  And with cigarettes you have to dedicate five to ten minutes each time you smoke, whereas with vaping you can just do it ten seconds at a time.  

Basically when I quit this Friday there are no real physical barriers to me just doing it whenever I want.  I plan on tossing my vape juice, but we all know how easy it is to just run and by more when you’re really jonesing.

I stopped smoking (after roughly 3 years) when I moved over a year ago, and only smoke on vacation (have had 2 weekends away from home since then). I have brought home a couple of cigarettes once. Almost all of my friends smoke, and I really want to join them when I visit in September, but he doesn’t believe that I can handle just smoking on vacation and then going back to not smoking cigs when I come home. This is partially because I did lie about the second weekend I smoked. He just gets sooooo upset, and I was alone with my abusive mother, who is the main reason I took up cigarettes in the first place.  We got in an actual argument over it last night, and we never ever get heated, usually we just debate things. He has never smoked or drank anything in his life, but understands addiction through gambling. Am I delusional? 


TLDR: I want to be indulgent for four days while I see my friends for the first time in a year but my bf will be extremely upset. Am I being selfish? Stupid?

Edit: more gushing. I think he’s overreacting, and I made a pact with myself to never buy another pack. I feel like I’m not allowed. He just thinks I’m incapable of not buying cigarettes when I come home even though I’ve already done that twice.

Another edit: my friends WILL NOT stop. Asking them to is futile, and I’m not cancelling the chance to see my friends again.

I was suffering with breathing issues that mimicked asthma and were pretty scary. I made the decision to quit and left my full pack of cigarettes sitting on my kitchen counter. I haven't touched a cigarette. 

Lately I've been going through a really rough time. Emotionally, mentally, I'm just in a really dark place. My husband still smokes. He has never been supportive when I quit. He's very confrontational when we have attempted to quit together and will fight with me and push until I cave and say to go get cigarettes and then he's good again. So this time around I chose to not expect him to quit with me and I did it on my own. 

Lately I'm really starting to resent him. I miss the cigarette. I miss the morning coffee talk over a couple of smokes and I miss being able to just take that five minutes to myself. When I walk by the door I can smell the cigarette smoke wafting inside and it makes my mouth water. 

I can't stand the way my husband smells when he gets close to me, and he knows it, so he chooses to stay away from me and still smoke. This is just adding to my resentment. Who would choose to smoke over being able to be close to their wife??

I can’t believe it’s been 7.5 days! Is anyone else just excited to breathe so much better???? I can’t wait to prove everyone (even myself) wrong.,"After my COVID test, two good old swabs up each brain entrance for 10 seconds each🤢, a nurse came in to ask some questions. Shortness of breath? Congestion? Cough? Trouble tasting or smelling? Among others. Every single question I answered “As much as any smoker.” Something about my cavalier attitude toward identifying as a smoker mixed with wow-my-normal-24 year old body is experiencing these problems daily/weekly and I’ve come to accept that?? hit me... At the end she asked if I had any questions. “Yeah please tell me why I should quit smoking.”

She said she’d smoked through med school working at a bar, attempted quitting several times, it finally worked blah blah blah. The way she quit (by sucking on nicotine lozenges during the time she’d usually go out to smoke) wasn’t for me but I walked out and haven’t touched a cigarette in 7 days.

Before that visit, I’d come off a week vacation with my family, no one smokes. I was always doing it alone and wondering how they could drink and NOT smoke. I was amazed and felt kinda pathetic. I even had to convince my brother to drive me for cigarettes one afternoon. I was embarrassed and I felt like I had no control and he had to see that.

Before that, I’d been on a camping trip with two friends (btw all of this was socially distanced I’m very COVID conscious and also why I got the test after) who both smoked, one much more than me. I was an alcohol induced chain smoker and occasionally throughout a sober day. Anyway, HE had quit. I was shocked. So now I’m the only smoker in THAT group.

Anyway, there were several things leading up to it that kept making my cigarette less and less... ‘fun’? My parents were both smokers for 20 years or so. They always said one day I’d just resent the cigarette and not even enjoy it so much. That one day, I’d be ready. It feels like I’m ready, but the first day I texted my dad I was quitting I said “I’m honestly not very confident in myself but...” For the first several days and even still, I’m like hey if you want a cigarette really bad you can have one later. I still have a pack. But I don’t want one. Even through the cravings, I say “hey you need a worse craving than this to cave” it’s not worth it. That’s just how I’m working through it for me!

It's become totally obvious to me how much my entire daily routine revolved around smoking. Now that I've quit, I don't know what to do with myself, because what I used to do I did so to facilitate having multiple cigs daily. Now I feel like my only real option for moving forward is to reinvent myself. 

I used to sub-contract for work, aka work out of my truck, for a few different companies, but apparently I chose to do so because I could smoke in my ""office"" (my truck). Now, I don't want to do that, I suddenly rather have a totally different job (okay do the same work but different settings surrounding it like a company owned truck). The people I worked with were all smokers, now I don't want to work with them because I don't want to keep pausing what I'm doing for a cig break. 

Now, ultimately I don't want to do anything but lie in bed and sleep because of the lack of nicotine in my system (a stimulant) has been curtailed, I'm finding myself tired and sleepy constantly as well (this is the real suck), and if I try to use more caffeine it makes me want to smoke more, ugh. 

Anyways, I'm 45, I've been a full time smoker since the age of 13, I'm done with it because of a recent health scare and hospital stay which woke me up, so I'm not going back to smoking. But getting two weeks into quitting now is an eye opener about how my life has been structured around being a smoker for so long, and I'm at a loss at what to do with myself to reinforce my decision to stop.",9,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8473792}"

Things have only got worse since then. I'm losing my mind living at home with no freedom. I don't see friends indoors, I don't go on holiday, I'm jobless for the time being and I feel like I'm going crazy. I've gone on a few walks with friends but it just doesn't help. I run everyday.

I feel like quitting really isn't helping my mental health. I smoked for 4 years, having around 3-7 RYO cigarettes a day. It never got to ""one pack a day"" levels. I know I can quit after lockdown or this pandemic has slightly ceased, but at home I feel so trapped I *really* wonder if I'm doing myself more harm than good by quitting. It's getting seriously unbearable living at home. I can't smoke weed because my family would kill me if they know. They don't even let me have a beer or two at night. I live with 6 people in a 2 bedroom house (and 2 of them are women so you can imagine how cramped this is, we have two people sleeping in the living room). Cigarettes or a juul or vape or something I can hide better. 

I'm worried that my brain is just rationalising the addiction. I had no issue quitting cigs back in April and I know it sounds ridiculous to expect people on here to suggest I do take up smoking again, but there has to be some type of positive, albeit temporary mental effect cigarettes has on you? The calm feeling I used to get when smoking could do me the world of good right now, it's not easy.

I had just quit drinking and recreational drugs, which was beginning to become a significant problem for me. A month later I was feeling proud of myself and wanted to carry the momentum over so I quit the cigarettes too. 

My housemates & I decided to quit smoking together, and I think a little friendly competition helped me as I wanted to be the last man standing. After they resumed smoking, they playfully taunted that it was a matter of time until I started again. It fuelled me to continue to abstain. 

I vaped to help quit and surprisingly didn’t struggle that much. I guess I was just in the right frame of mind to make changes in my life, idk. There was the odd occasion I walked by someone in the street and thought mhmm I could do with one of those, or those times I’d reminisce about a ciggie with friends, totally glamourising them but quickly extinguishing the thought. There was never any real desire to light up again. A few temptations but on the whole, I quit on my first try without a hitch thankfully. 

However, these past few weeks, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about smoking. It started with seeing people on TV/films smoke which made me yearn for my former love, and then a discussion about the old days with a friend on FaceTime, who then confessed she had a few cheeky ones at the weekend after a drink. A few days later, another friend sent me an old photo of us together on a night out and I had a lit cigarette in hand. Which was strange as I’d always hide them behind my back if someone got their phone out for a snap. But in this particular photo, it was front and centre. Loud and proud. “Why should you be ashamed?” my younger self taunted at me. Then I was in Tesco the following day, after a particular crummy day and the person in front of me bought some cigarettes. In a brief moment of madness, the thought really crossed my mind to buy a pack of 20 Sovereign then and there. The fag of champions! Obviously, I didn’t and bought my babybels and Diet Coke and gorged on cheese and caffeine that night instead. 

I don’t know whether it’s because of the stress of all that’s going on in the world, the isolation of working and spending so much time at home or what. Is a two year itch a thing? Has anybody else experienced this? Will it pass?

However, he plateaued at reducing his smoking down to 3 packs in a day, and eventually gave up, getting rid of the vape. At this point, he seems disinterested in quitting again.

Is there anything in particular that resonated with or spurred you to quit? I know it might be a useless question, but I'm hoping something mentioned might resonate with him as well. With the current Coronavirus situation, his family's history of smoking going poorly with regard to heart health, and his vascular system not being as well due to previous drug habits, I'd like to try to encourage his mindset toward at least the idea of quitting tobacco again.

If not, are there any ideas on ways to help avoid creeping back up in usage at least? As it is, I think recent stresses may be making it more difficult for him to sustain at 3, and not move back toward 4.

Not as bad as smoking but not better then not smoking anything.  

Anyway, I was reading a book earlier and it was talking about running and I'm like fuck I need to start running.  I've always had this phobia of running but really it's one of the best ways to get into shape and stay that way.  

So basically I said, ""Fuck, fuck, fine I'll do it."" And I made a plan to start running five nights a week.  At least two miles until I can start running more.  Tonight's the first night.  

It's pretty much just like the smoking thing though.  I loved smoking for sure but figured if I don't smoke any cigarettes then I can quit smoking, and if I make myself run then I can start running like I need too.

I think for me the third day was the worst. The anxiety mounted all day long until it finally slid off of me in the late afternoon. I know I will remember that moment for the rest of my life. It felt SO GOOD to suddenly realize that I was going to beat this monstrous addiction that had controlled roughly 20 years of my life.

The anxiety was there one moment, and gone the next. It was almost like learning that your childhood bully has moved away to another town.

The feeling was so profound and powerful that I found myself laughing before I realized it. I could feel the end of the nicotine withdrawal, almost like a veil being lifted. For the first time in longer than I could remember, I didn't have that quiet, secret terror lurking in the recesses of my mind.

That wasn't the end of the difficulty by any means. I would still crave smoking from time to time, but it was easy to remind myself that I didn't ever want to face that again. So easy in fact, that when life jumped the rails a few weeks later and the stress cranked up to 11, the thought of lighting up a smoke only crossed my mind long enough for me to thank God that I don't smoke anymore.

Cigarettes stressed me out. Nicotine stressed me out and gave me anxiety, because that is how they work.

Did you know it only takes about an hour after smoking a cigarette for your body to begin showing signs of nicotine withdrawal? For me, this meant when I was a smoker, that I was in withdrawal for parts of every day. When I would wake up in the morning: nicotine withdrawal. While at work: nicotine withdrawal. Smoke like a chimney during lunch break: early afternoon nicotine withdrawal.

I wanted to quit for a long time, but it wasn't until I learned about the mechanisms of nicotine withdrawal that I found the perseverance to finally succeed.

That was 2017 days ago now, and at this point, I can't remember the last time I even thought about smoking.  I can honestly say I'm proud of myself. I didn't think I would ever be able to do it, but I did. I'm a nonsmoker. You can do it too. Just hang in there!",18,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.401767}"

4 days ago I woke up and went outside to start the day off in the normal way. As I was about to light up my brain randomly decided to say ""You know what, fuck this shit, give up now!""

So I threw the pack into the wet bin outside and not had one since. The excitement of giving up got me through the first 3 days but that's kind wearing off.

My partner is still smoking which isn't helping but I can't expect her to quit on a whim after all this time so it's cool. I'm just finding it hard.

I hadn't run out of cigarettes in over a year based on this habit. 

I had been telling myself I needed to quit for months. I had multiple health problems and really needed to just kick the habit, but I couldn't seem to let it go. I had even bought some of that Lucy nicorette gum, because they had a sample pack offer for only 5 bucks. But I kept on with it, hating myself a little bit for not being able to let it go. 

So yeah, realizing that I was officially out of cigarettes for the first time in over a year just felt like a sign. It was time. I texted my boyfriend that I was out and not buying anymore. 

I haven't smoked a single cigarette since! 
It's been 16 days as of 30mins ago. 

I've been feeling a lot better, and although it's been rough every now and then, I'm down to only one or two pieces of gum a day. Sometimes I can go a whole day without any help! I'm really glad I've made this choice. I don't plan on ever going back.

Left with an emphysema diagnosis at 30 years old. "")","So I have been smoking since 16, heavily from 18 onward. I had severe GERD and got an endoscopy. Looked clean but while waiting for the biopsy results doctor suggested I get a chest CT for the chest and back burn/pain, just in case it is something else.

Due to GERD, 2.5 weeks ago I decide I should really stop smoking and try to become healthier. I made a pact with myself to clean my lungs and started jogging. Side note, I do not have shortness of breath, do not cough, I am able to exercise with no trouble (sure I get tired but it is normal) and my blood work is great and my weight is normal.

So here I am, waiting for the CT results, being like: doctor is gonna tell me to quit, for sure.

In my country, when we take any type of test, we take the results to the doctor, it is not sent to her/him (with a few exceptions). So I got my tests and of course, opened the envelope to see. I notice something along the lines of ""emphysema lesions"" (this is a rough trasnlation of the term in the results). I  google and see that emphysema is part of COPD and I am like: ""Thank God I got it early. This must be the pre-COPD findings and I am sure I can clean these babies."" I sincerely thought that I had something that showed I had a predispotion to COPD but I was in the clear.  
 (My partner's friend has COPD so I had an idea of the severity and of it being a disease that affects older smokers, and that ""older"" part relieved me.)

I take the results to the doctor (pulmonologist) and he reads quietly. First thing he says "" you will quit now or by the time you are 50, you will be dragging your oxygen tank around. You have emphysema at only 30 years old.""    


We talk, we talk and since I had not realized yet, I ask, ""Do I have COPD?"" he says: Yes. I think he knew that, in my ears, COPD sounded more serious than emphysema, which was an unknown till then word. My face changed.  


Before I leave,  doctor also asks for an alpha test, to see if I have a genetic predisposition that could cause the emphysema to appear in such a young age.  Still waiting for the results but this is irrelevant. The fact is that, I fucked up.

I am not sad, stressed, scared. What  I am is enraged. I am so pissed off at myself. I hate me for doing this to my body. I want to punch me in the face. For all those times I knew I did not really  feel like smoking or I had a cough or I had my allergies but still lit the fucking cigarette. I hate myself for even thinking this was cool, or okay, or acceptable or something that would not affect ME. So so so stupid, ignorant. This self loathing is fueling my need to fight this even more. I am determined to make sure that I keep this in check and do my best to live a long, healthy and happy life.

I cannot even imagine myself smoking again. I know most people here are fighting their own fight with this unhealthy habit. All I can say is, thank you to all those people whose success stories in here have helped me and motivated me.

And , to all those who have just quit, I promise YOU CAN DO IT. I can do it, I have to and I want to. None of us has to get to a point where they HAVE to quit.

Fuck smoking and fuck everything/everyone who makes us feel like we can't, or worse, don't have to quit. Fuck those who have convinced us that quitting will make us fat or sad or angry or less interesting.

We can be healthy. We can be happy. We can have more money in our wallets. Only good things will come by quitting and we all deserve them.

I wish everyone in this great community health and happiness. Your awesome progress and support helps me stay on track.

We both smoked when we fell in love at 16. I quit when is was 21. He tried to, but wasn’t successful

Around 10 years later, he did quit for about 6 months and I was so proud of him. Then I started smelling smoke on his clothes, he’d say oh I was standing around after work with colleagues who smoke. Eventually I found lighters in his pocket. Then, he said he needed to sleep in the spare room because he just couldn’t sleep in the same bed as me, he snores loud and had insomnia, and wakes up all night. He was saying he was too tired to work properly with so little sleep so I let him. 

Fast forward and we had a baby. He was making excuses to leave me at night like oh I really want to go by a drink, go get some macas etc. I was pissed because I knew he was smoking and I hated the mistrust of sneaking around. 5 years later and he’s still waiting until I go to bed and will go smoke at like 11om and then go sleep in the spare room. We’re currently in lockdown in Melbourne and he goes out just to buy coffee so he can smoke away from me. 

He says he wants to quit, but doesn’t. It’s hard, I get it. I was a smoker too. But enough enough, he’s 35 and has been smoking for 20 years. I’ve asked him not to sneak it, I know you smoke so just do it and stop hiding it from me. He says he’s ashamed and embarrassed and thinks he might smoke more if he dies it in front of me.

I am making this my first post and honestly quite desperate at this point. Basically, I used to love smoking the electronic cigarette for over 3 years. I have tried the juul, myle, puff bar, and basically everything in between. I would smoke from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to sleep. One day (three weeks ago), after smoking I got really bad heart palpitations and was vomiting to the point where I ended up in the ER. This was when I decided to quit and get the nicotine gum to help me with that...with the gum I was still throwing up ALOT, having panick attacks, and decided to just go cold turkey. Ever since I quit (even the days with the gum), I have had the WORST insomnia-to the point where I literally can't fall asleep no matter how hard I have tried. I have never had that problem...I used to be able to fall asleep at any time of the day and sleep half the day if I really wanted to. I have been to the doctor multiple times-got prescribed ambien for a few days (slept like 3-4 hours with that), then hydroxoxyde (slept 6-7 hours but still got up multiple times during the night and then the second and third time I tried it, it didn't work. I have tried everything from melatonin to valerian root to sleepy time teas. Some nights I can't sleep for a single hour, other nights after taking one or combo of sleep aids (sometimes they work, sometimes they don't) I'll fall asleep for like 3 hours max. I feel so physically weak and honestly running out of hope. I don't know what to do anymore and don't know how many more days I can take this. Even though I feel tired and ""calm"" before bed, I still can't physically fall asleep. Did anyone go through a similar experience and know, how long it will last? Its been over 3 weeks and I feel like a complete zombie. I can't function normally and even though I was supposed to be starting grad school in a few weeks, I honestly think I might have to cancel this year because I don't wanna mess up my grades due to my physical state.

So my wife and I quit last Wednesday. I love her dearly and support her in all her endeavors in any way I can. And this was her idea. More her insistence. She would find it very difficult if not impossible to quit if I were to continue smoking, and I don’t want to do that to her. But damn, I didn’t really want to quit and I am miserable.

In ways I feel better. And I am happy to be saving the money. But mentally I am a mess. My job stresses me out 10x more now. Before I could see all the shit going on in the world and pay attention but not feel like it is crushing me, but now I feel a weight on my shoulders every time I glance at the news. I can’t stand hearing about my wife’s job. I used to be a pretty patient and laid back person. Now I just want to go live in a cabin in the woods and everyone else can go fuck off. 

Worst of all, I hate just not being able to go have a smoke. I hate feeling caged in. I hate not having a choice. And I am starting to resent my wife. Every time she acts all chipper and happy about how long its been it makes me cranky. Even worse of she gets cranky I get *really* cranky. In my head I hear this shitty nic-fitty side of me yelling “you chose this! Stop complaining!” And I hate this side of myself. 

I know if I broke down and smoked the guilt would suck any enjoyment out of it too. So that sucks too. Does everyone go through this? I keep telling myself to just take it 1 day at a time, but if this is what each day is going to be like I’ll trade in the extra years I potentially get for quitting to just feel better in the now. Shortsighted, I know.

What does it mean?,"I had a great first month of no cigarettes. My first real successful attempt using the Allen Carr book. I had minor cravings to smoke which were easily dismissed with a deep breath and some mindfulness. I felt like I really had gotten over smoking and was really happy about it. I had drank, and been drinking around friends who were smoking with no problem at all

This past weekend, I got drunk with my girlfriend and she bought a pack of cigarettes. She was never really a smoker but would enjoy bumming a cigarette from me when we would drink. I smoked a few that night, kind of an experiment to see how much I disliked them. And I did - they tasted awful and were overall unpleasant. However, the next night we drank a bit again and I smoked a couple more and then threw the pack away.

During the week I had more cravings than normal. Last night we drank again and I went out and got a pack, just to smoke a couple and throw them away again.

At this point I'm concerned that I'm about to slip back into habitual smoking. I even thought to myself ""maybe I should just buy a pack and read the Allen Carr book again and start everything over"" which I'm pretty sure was the nicotine talking.

My question is - what does it mean that I smoked 2-3 cigarettes on 3 occasions within 7 days while drunk? During the days I mostly feel normal and without cravings. Am I a smoker again? Is all my progress gone? Physically do I have to reset my count? Will I be 'addicted to cigarettes' for another 3 weeks?  

Regardless I'm gonna stay away from drinking for a bit and express to my GF how important it is that I quit for good",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.47234982}"

Seen  a doctor about it who couldn't find a single thing wrong with me. Is it  possible that all these symptoms are just cause of too much nicotine?  Cause I was using quite a lot in retrospect, and I'm otherwise stumped  as to what's making me so hyperactive and jittery. Still trying to taper down my usage, but I can't tell if it's helping my symptoms.

Anybody have any advice, or have been through similar experiences?",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.83420604}"

Kenneth (BE) here,

Just wanted to check if anyone has/had any experience with Champix. I quit smoking in Januari this year, cold turkey, but 2 days before the 3 months mark i got in a huge fight with my gf and we both started again. After a month or so we tried this thing calles Champix and it all seems to go pretty well but after 3 months it should be enough, and you should stop using it. 

The thing is, i dont even think about smoking anymore but today it hit me: almost 3 months, the hardest time last time i tried. What if i stop with Champix and the cravings return?

L-theanine is also very calming, almost sedating, which can help with withdrawals. It reduces anxiety, and taken with Caffeine makes you stimulated but relaxed at the same time. I'd just like to put this out here, since it could be a good alternative to Nicotine, which is also stimulating and sedating at the same time.

I smoked from the age of 16 to 27. At least 10 cigarettes a day for over a decade. It was a big part of my life. A big part of my identity, in a weird way. I loved smoking. 

Eventually I started to feel the effects of it. I was out of breath and energy all the time. I found myself smoking when I didn't even want a cigarette. It became a nervous tick. I had a lot of anxiety and my addiction to smoking was a big part of that. After 10 years of fun, smoking finally felt like a problem. 

So at the start of March I quit. I vaped for the first 6 weeks, and have been totally nicotine free since mid-April. Obviously the cravings sucked at first, but I was also excited to be quitting. It felt like an achievement. I found that drinking made my cravings even more intense, so I stopped drinking too. The first couple of months felt like they were going well, but the last 6 weeks or so have been really, really hard. 

I lost my job due to Covid, so I have a lot of time on my hands. I tried to exercise and stay busy, but I've lost motivation. I don't feel proud that I quit smoking anymore. I'm not excited to be getting in shape anymore. I'm fighting cravings pretty much constantly. Smoking is constantly on my mind. My quality of life is not better for having quit smoking, even if my health is. Maybe it will eventually get better, but I have no idea how long that will take.

However I do want to share something, something that motivates to stopping for me:

12 years ago, 2008, I was 20 years old, did not smoke or do any drugs. Apart from social drinking. A girl I went to school with phoned me out of the blue and invited me over to her place. Just me and her. So I went. Now I have always told anyone I don't smoke. Plus I disliked smoking also. Yet, when she asked me that night do I smoke, I said yes. Obviously I did not know how to smoke she realised this and taught me. I liked it because I liked her.

Maybe just an hour later she said she is going to fetch something that we can also smoke but to not judge. That was meth. I thought what harm can it do it's like drinking a shot you never tried before. Long story short, me and her got together every day that we could and smoked meth, and cigarettes obviously. We had a fall out, rehab, and since 2009 I stopped smoking meth, and have not touched it or any other hard drug ever since.

So how this relates for me to smoking, why I wrote this little history, is that in a way smoking still has a hold on me from that very day I went there, that day I made the poor choice of accepting to do drugs. And even though I put the drugs in the past, smoking still remains. What I'm saying I guess is that I was not meant to be a smoker. But I chose it and not once have I tried to quit out of my own.

So I guess I'm asking for motivation, I notice many people here do. What app do you guys recommend? Obviously I'm leaving some details out in this post. And for what it's worth, I am currently working on getting my own thing going to work for myself, I don't really have any other choice right now, and it is something I want to succeed in though. Is it doable to stop smoking and doing this at the very same time? I feel I'm just going to get very irretated. But on the other hand it keeps me busy, so maybe that helps?

Sorry for the long post, but thought I'd say hi and ask for help/ motivation. Plus is it normal to not want to do anything if you can't smoke? And being kind of mad at everything? Or is that just a dumb switch in the mind?

Thanks.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5058939}"

I believe that a variable that started this week was boredom. I have been working from home with two people and a corgi in the house, which wasn't bad because I had social interaction. Starting last week I'm just sitting at home with the corgi, who isn't much of a conversationalist. I can manage the cravings, and generally don't have a problem ignoring them, but not being able to focus may impact work, which is why the brainfog is my least favorite.

Having watched some of these, it reaffirms my decision of quitting and makes me happier that I did so. Seeing all these people's stories of being lifelong smokers and ending up with lung cancer, copd, throat cancer, gum disease, etc look pretty terrifying. This only emphasizes the reasons to quit and never start if you've never smoked as all these people who did regret that they ever started as it eventually compromised their life or even led to an early death over a stupid habit.

I started smoking cigarettes in high school around 1994. That habit grew and continued for about 15 years. Then in my early 30’s I decided that I was tired of this expensive pack a day habit ($3 -$4 a pack then), I wanted to breathe better and my wife who never smoked a day in her life would probably love not smelling my odors anymore. I decided to “quit”. 

“Quit” I did. Well, at least I told myself that. In reality, I just replaced one nicotine addiction with another. It started with the gum. Then Camel came out with this thing that was brand new to Americans... SNUS. “Oh man!!! You’re telling me I can give up my smokes for these tiny little packs of delicious flavored nicotine filled packs that I don’t need to spit and I won’t smell like a pile of smoldering crap!” 

I replaced smokes with Snus. That lasted a few months. Then I went on a road trip and on some of those stops, they didn’t have Snus. Well, I wasn’t going to start smoking again and I damn sure wasn’t gonna go the next few hours without my nicotine!!.. so I bought a tin of Copenhagen. Wintergreen Long Cut... oh man... sooo damn smooth. Like minty butter. “What the fuck am I wasting my time with this Snus crap for?! I mean hell, it literally has a coffee filter like material blocking all the goodness from my mouth!” That was the end of the Snus and the beginning of a long, constant relationship with Copenhagen. 

12 long years after I “quit” smoking and here we are. Day 11. 26 years of tobacco addiction in one form or another and here I am proud to be finishing day fucking 11. 

There was no rhyme or reason to it either. I had thought about quitting a million times. My daughters have asked me what those “circle tins” are for and why can’t they have any for a few years. I just woke up one morning and after breakfast I drove to the local pharmacy and bought a box of patches and a few packs of spearmint gum. 

I know I’m not out of the woods yet but it is getting easier every day and I really feel like I am going to succeed this time. I honestly think the biggest factor this time is that I was just ready. I didn’t have to psych myself up for it. I didn’t have to choose or schedule my quit date. I just woke up one morning where I didn’t feel like throwing that pinch in my lip and said “fuck it”. Grabbed my keys and bought the patches. I had some tough days. My wife has almost told me to just go to the store and buy some more chew on more than one occasion but she has kept her cool and has been supportive; only telling me what she almost said after we were back to normal. 

Anyways, that’s my current story. I imagine some others here may relate to some of it too. My journey has just started but I can say that day 11 has been way easier than day 2. Good luck to everyone!",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.58229727}"

I started smoking properly at 14, started trying to quit at age 24, and approaching my 32nd year here I am yet again finding myself smoking for the past few weeks. 

The longest I have gone is one year, on two occasions. I stopped as soon as I found out I was pregnant with both my children: - as soon as I knew I was pregnant that was it, there was no second thoughts about it. I just stopped no problem, no cravings at all, I knew that's what I had to do and I did it, thankfully. Yet, as soon as my children were born and I began to have the occasional drink I found the old cravings setting in, but of course I knew they were more psychological than anything. The first time I slipped and had a smoke when I was drinking my partner warned me that I would be back regularly smoking before I knew it, and foolishly I attested that no, it would only be when I had a drink. Then it turns into when he would take the kids out I would think having the odd sneaky one would be OK... I can stop when I want, I've done it before, right? See, nicotine is a filthy beast, and as soon as you have that hit it's back in your head and you're even trying to fool yourself.

I think the stress of the pandemic amongst other life stressors gave me the excuse to say fuck it, I can smoke, my mental health is suffering and I could be doing worse, but in all reality is there a worse time to begin smoking, given our current climate. Seriously, I'm a fucking dumbass of the highest order. 

I don't know if there is even a point to this post. I'm just soo annoyed with myself that I'm here, yet again, after swearing never again, yet again! I feel like I will never be rid of this want, and in all reality I know how absolutely disguising it is, and I'm soo ashamed, but a part of me is enjoying throwing all caution to the wind and enjoying that sneaky smoke when my partner and children are not around. It was like a rush at the beginning, but now that I've told my partner what I am doing the thrill is out of it, but alas the addiction has slowly set in. 

I know what I need to do, it's just wising the fuck up and taking the first step. I think maybe I need something else to occupy my mind during those times. I know I'm gonna quit again, when, I don't know. I have the next week in my head, cold turkey like the last two times. I know I can do this, but, I thought I would stop along here to motivate me to stay a non smoker. First stop is to stop having a drink at the weekend, then move forward from there. Any advice is welcome. 

If you've read this far, thank you.

I smoke maryjane regularly, so I do know what it is to smoke, and what it is to not smoke (or try). But recently I’ve come into a problem (short term pleasure , long term problem) with the new electronic vapes, or literally e - cigarettes as some people call them. An electronic cigarette.. very ironic , but very different from actual cigarettes. Been hooked on the nicotine from these suckers for about a year now. And the only positive thing I would say that came out of them is the fact that I have lowered the maryjane consumption to by about 60% to just a joint or two daily. But only after a year I am starting to feel my body react to the constant toxins my lungs are taking in. I would really like to quit before it overpowers me, but everytime the battery dies I tell myself I should not buy another one.  Until the cravings start kicking in , I spend most of my day on the road so it’s nothing for to pass by a smoke shop and get one. On the box it brings 3 disposable pods , apparently equivalent to 60 actual cigarettes. 3 pods last me a bout a week, so 60 cigarettes in a week does not sound at all. So my main reason for posting here would be to try and start gathering information to compose a plan , on how I could permanently stop smoking the toxic new generation version of a cigarettes and just stick with a joint a day. Cravings kick in at :Mornings after morning routine , after ANY satisfying meals, occasional moments of stress ,  long car rides , or extreme boredom.
Would really like to find ways to substitute the satisfaction the nicotine gives me in all the different craving times.

That cigarettes had a terrible impact on my mental and physical health, but I could stop it, that it wasn't too late. That my body and mind that have recovered from other terrible things could learn to function without cigarettes and that I deserve to actually seriously try. 

I don't want to smoke anymore. For real. I deserve to stop wanting them, to learn how to accept anger and anxiety without smokes, to know what happiness and hunger and boredom feel like.

Step 1: Embrace the fact that it’s an addiction 

Step 2: Set a date. It’s normal to target milestone days like birthdays, anniversaries, etc. but I failed several times, until I didn’t this last time.

Step 3: I made a list of reasons why I wanted to quit. Bad breath, gums coated, inability to run more than 5k. And that I didn’t want to set a bad example for my niece.

Step 4: Research. I read books, articles and stories about quitting. I spoke to a few people who had successfully quit. Everyone said it’s the hardest thing they did. Barring one friend, who had no idea when or how he stopped smoking. His nonchalance made it seem like no-big-deal. And that gave me the nudge I needed.

Step 5: It does take will power for the first few days. At least it did for me. But after the first 3-5 days, the joy of beating the addiction and bwing free has been enough.

Step 6: one thing at a time. I used nicotine gum after a failed attempt a few months back without NRT. Not as per the instructions, but just when I craved. The daily consumption still fluctuates up and down, but it really helps me do my job - which is quite demanding and does not allow an off-day for a cloudy head.

Step 7: One day at a time. Distractions help. Not talking about it or avoiding thinking about it helps too. My sister became my sponsor and that talking to her stopped me more than once from caving. I also binged watched more shows in 3 weeks than in the last 3 months - which is
both a distraction and a daily dose of reward! 

Step 8: Smoke Free app helps provide reminders on milestones, savings and health benefits and even talking to the bot twice a day has helped me stay on the path.

""Quitting"" so far lasted until next morning, usually. I also have horrible chronic sinusitis due damaged nose, cough like a coal miner in the morning (with similar color phlegm coming out), my fingers have this constant, unwashable yellow shade to them, every surface in my house reeks even though I don't even smoke indoors, etc. So for 22 years, every 40 minutes, like clockwork, I lit up. More often when drinking or sleep-deprived. I've turned two girlfriends into smokers, just because... I guess it's easier to cope being next to a chainsmoker if you're smoking too? 

Pretty sure that in heavenly records, my life expectancy was somewhere near 50 years at this rate. But smoking was so second-nature, I wasn't even dreaming of quitting at any point. I was sure I'd crawl up the walls for few days and then start again, why suffer for nothing?

During my last heavy dual sinus infection (I get them every 6-8 weeks) I was so miserable I simply decided to quit. I had a ton of nicotine patches accumulated in my drawer for years. No, not to quit smoking, but to survive anytime I had to not smoke for more than 4-5 hours, like long flights and such. It was that bad. Why not use them? I remember that patches didn't make much difference on those flights, so I doubted they'd work at all.

So, I slapped on a 14mg patch and gave my three half packs of smokes away. To my surprise, nothing happened. No horrible cravings. Odd. I also had a dispenser of NiQuitin 1.5mg lozenges. So when cravings eventually came, just put one in my mouth. That thing melts for good 40 minutes and totally removes any cravings. Ate 5-6 first few days, now I get by with 2-3 per day.

Sure, that's a lot of nicotine I'm still under, but nicotine isn't even my primary concern right now. 8 days of not putting horrible tar into my hair, skin and lungs is already such a victory I feel like I want to cry. 

It works. I think quitting during infection helped as well - I was too busy suffering health issues, cigarette cravings went sort of less noticed. Slowly trying to go longer stretches without a patch and it's not particularly hard. Even though I don't even care that much, I feel like even if I have to wear them until I die, I've still won a major battle - patches don't give you lung cancer, make you obnoxious to other people and kill you off at age 50. But of course, since I got this far, I'll go few more weeks, switch to weaker ones and eventually, try to get rid of any nicotine whatsoever.

People often mention ""slipping"", but being lucky of getting out of literal hell, I can't even imagine of wasting it in any way! No slipping in no form or under any excuse.

""It's not that hard"". That was my main revelation. I imagined it'd be hell. In reality, self-guilt from being a horrible human ashtray was a ton of more suffer. Do quit.",88,{'infect': 2},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5814188}"

I know I’ve got an uphill battle with the hand-to-mouth fixation, so I am considering doing the Nicoderm patch and/or lozenge combo to help tackle that headache.

I’d hate to start with 24mg given I’ve been vaping 3mg, but given I do it frequently all day, I just wasn’t sure.

I also wanted to share a bit of my experience with the ungodly process of quitting. 

Oddly enough, it was only right before my 6 month achievement that my gums finally stopped bleeding while brushing my teeth. I was just expecting to live with blood in the sink forever, but that seems to have stopped. 

I have started battling skin issues that only seemed to arise after quitting, like either psoriasis or eczema on my scalp and elbows that comes and goes. Have not found a cream or diet that seems to have a lasting effect. I read that nicotine can actually help suppress this, so this seems to be an unfortunate side effect for me. 

My overall health has sky rocketed and I feel more capable, HOWEVER... I have bad mental days and my mood is still not consistent even while having a healthy diet with minimal junk food. When I am really low is when I want to smoke, but it’s not even really a smoke I want, it’s more like my body wants a release of some kind, like what smoking used to give me. Now I just go for a short walk. 

After about 4 months, the actual cravings almost stopped dead and I started to only occasionally think about smoking like you would about someone you used to know in the past. At the same time though, I started struggling in all the areas where I used smoking as a crutch and had no coping skills: Angry at someone? Can’t smoke. What now? Uhh. Deep breath. Talk it out, then short walk. Seems to help a little. Social anxiety? Can’t smoke. Go out for “fresh air” and a short walk. Seems to help. Kind of awkward. Bored? Sit there and actually analyze my personality quirks and assess myself, try different hobbies, then go for a short walk. It’s difficult, to confront yourself. Seems to help a little. 

This has been my experience. I won’t talk much about the first 4 months. There’s already a lot on this sub about how to take cravings one at time, NTAP, etc. 

I would ABSOLUTELY love to hear your coping mechanisms. What has been working for you?

My first real attempt in almost 20 years, and not to get my hopes up, but it really feels like I’ll be able to do this right the first time.","These COVID times have been weird for everyone, but advantageous for me as a smoker. I spent the first few months of quarantine drinking with my SO and our roommate almost every night out of shear boredom. With that drinking, for me, meant more cigarettes. I started when I was 14, and am now 34, but for the last 5 or 6 years I’d been smoking rather strong hand-rolled tobacco. It started to catch up with me. 

I began having days of alcohol/nicotine hangover/withdrawal which were depressing for sure, but the nicotine also just made me feel like I was slowly poisoning myself. That is, of course, exactly what I was doing. I really started to feel it killing me ,so almost on a whim, I quit. 

I lost both of my jobs to the pandemic, save for one Saturday/week.  There are no social events either. Basically, if I can ignore the looming omnipresent stress of just being alive in 2020, this is probably the least stressful or anxiety-provoking time of my adult life. This combination of circumstances made this feel like my now-or-never moment. I started to stock up. 

I gave myself two dry-run days, Friday and Saturday. I’d go as much of the day as I could without smoking but allowing myself to cave at the end. This is because that Saturday was my last day of work for a week, and work is stressful. I got off work, had a few beers and a few cigarettes. Sunday was day 1. 

I’d stocked up on snacks, mint toothpicks, gum, health foods, nuts, a CBD vape (no nicotine), sleep aid, movies, picked out a few books I want to read, got a new video game, did some research on quitting, and basically began prepping for a storm. I was fully prepared to ride out these first two weeks as comfortably as possible. 

I told my SO and roommate to give me space if I wanted it, and they have been wonderful. I kept myself busy with my snacks, reading, tinkering with stuff as I watched tv, and I wasn’t really going outside. I replaced coffee with Irish breakfast tea, and it helps that I stopped smoking in my car years ago- two triggers gone. Another huge trigger was alcohol, which I have mostly avoided, save for a glass or two of wine before bed (not mixed with sleep-aid. Don’t be dumb and kill your self please). 

I have hardly left the house, taking non-habit forming sleep aids or melatonin at night with relaxing herbal-tea. I get the worst cravings around 10 or 11 pm, and I just keep reminding myself that it won’t last more than 20 minutes, and that my brain is just rewiring itself. I also keep reminding myself of how much better I feel physically every day that I don’t smoke. That Smoke Free app has definitely been my little buddy for tracking my time smoke-free and my health progress. I highly recommend it. Here I am on day 8, and through everything I listed above, it has been more manageable than I ever thought possible. I can’t see going back after this.

Started smoking when I was nineteen. 20 cigarettes a day for the last three years. I've been a non-smoker for 10 days 6 months ago and I couldn't believe how easy it was. I smoked again when I was bored, also lack of resolution caused by everyday masturbation besides alcohol withdrawal symptoms. I Was diagnosed with ADHD 16 months ago. Took Ritalin 2-3 a day for 3 months and began to take more to get high. Ten a day for 2 months, lost weight and damaged my eyesight besides much more. Tapered my dosage down to 4-6 a day and getting close to zero a day. 
When I take 1 Ritalin or more, I experienced serious cravings and smoking is more enjoyable and reasonable but makes me feel normal so took more pills to get high, just like alcohol that had a mystic dimension when I was a no smoker. Cigarettes made me feel not drunk yet and no more enjoyable...
Cigarettes make me leave my tasks unfinished and feeling detached from what I'm doing right after the last cigarettes. Made my concentration worse and weaken my mind due to poor blood circulation and it was obvious to me. I had a teacher in the university, a mystic kind of teacher who had 10+ Ph.D. degrees. He changed my life in a big way, He showed me the path I was searching for since childhood and I turned to an optimistic guy who pulsing positive energy around. The happiest years of my life. I started my work online and had enough income since then, found greatest friends around the world, however, I was a smoker when I met the teacher and I had 24 years old. One day he started talking about drugs and turned his eyes to me and said the cigarettes are worse than Heroine. I should have been quite smoking right away but didn't.
Ritalin weakened my spirituality side of my life that discovered and had a big part in my life. Ritalin made me sad and angry but I prefer it over cigarettes. Cigarettes are the worse habit a human can have. Not because it's bad, because it's stupid.

I did try to quit during the last 4 weeks but my attempts usually failed during the afternoon. One time I was able to not take a puff but wasn't able to sleep that night. Terrible bout of insomnia. So I had a cig and was sleeping in minutes.
I tried to stop with Nicorette Spray also but the withdrawal from it was much worse then from smokes. So I came back to the smokes but tried it again with a different plan: 

I watched ""how to successfully quit smoking"" videos before I started this very attempt. I watched them for hours and hours. The key message which helped me was:

Nicotine keeps you addicted if you use it. The strongest urge to smoke is in the two hour timeframe after your last cigarette. After 12 hours most of the nicotine is already out of the body.
So to end the cravings it isn't recommended to smoke one because this will only restart the cycle.

I smoked my last cigarette, got to bed and did an intense workout the next morning to accelerate the process of my body getting rid of the nicotine.

I started smoking cigarettes at 18 yo. I smoked half pack a day. I quit when I was 22 yo. 

When I was 30 yo I started socially smoking cigarettes and then very quickly became super addicted. I smoked heavily for the next year, sometimes two packs a day. I quit cigarettes in about a week by transitioning to a Juul. I didn’t think I could be anymore addicted to nicotine than I already was but that Juul was all I could think about. Once the flavor ban hit, I switched to disposable vapes. 

I decided to quit about 6 months ago. I used the patches and successfully abstained for a month. Stress broke me and I went back to the disposable vape. This time Puff Bars, which are gross anyways because the majority are not branded. 

But since I went back, I often don’t feel good. In the last month, my general well being has gone down significantly. I feel sick to my stomach, weird body shocks, different than any other type of nausea I have had. I suspected it was the vape but it was never a immediate reaction to hitting it and I didn’t have it in me to quit again. 

However, today I only took two hits from the vape. Most of the day, sickkkkkkk, which is pretty typical. Then I decided to quit today. I started to feel somewhat better several hours after the last hit. I threw it out and went and got the patches again. I bought the step 2, 14 mg. And within a couple of hours, sick again. 

How could my body not be able to tolerate nicotine anymore?!? The cravings are real and intense right now but I can’t use any nicotine replacement therapy because I feel any nicotine is making me very ill. 

Also noteworthy, I started Welbutrin about two months ago. I thought Welbutrin blocked nicotine receptors not enhance them so that the smallest amount of nicotine makes you want to throw up.

 Take a notebook an starting now, write down every cigarette you smoke.

How do you record a cigarette? You write down 3 things:

– The time you smoked that cigarette.
– What you were doing while smoking that cigarette.
– What’s the reason you smoked that cigarette (any reason).

It is really that simple.

But the trick is to Note every cigarette right after you smoke it!

Let’s say you woke up, made coffee and now you are drinking your coffee with your cigarette.
Right after you finish that cigarette, take your notebook. and write down

1. The time you smoked: e.g., 7:15 am.
2. What you were doing while smoking: drinking my coffee.
3. Why did you smoke: “out of habit, can’t drink coffee without smoking.”

Another example.

Maybe you feel stressed. Without thinking about it, you are already holding a cigarette and lighting it up.

Right after you put off that cigarette, take your notebook and make a record of it.

1. Time: 14:48.
2. What was happening: I was nervous at work, needed it to calm down.
3. Reason for smoking: to relax, something to do with my hands.

You will see the difference in just a few days if you record every cigarette. To make the most out of this exercise, keep recording every cigarette you have for 1 week.

👉It works.
Here’s why:

👇Why this Quit Smoking Technique Works
1. You understand that you don’t smoke without reason, or just because your body needs it.

2. You explore all the conscious and unconscious reasons you smoke because your brain starts picking up on things about yourself and your environment that you ignored before.

3. And you inspect your smoking habit so closely it becomes less attractive.

If something seems insignificant, write it anyway.

I made my reddit account 2 years ago in anticipation of needing lots of support as I attempted to quit cigarettes cold turkey after smoking a pack a day for 27 years.  Turns out, I had all the motivation within me, and I didn't really need this place as a support.  Not everyone is the same, and maybe you need nicotine replacement or the support of a community, that's fine because the end goal is the same.  Freedom from cigarettes.

Here I am 2 years to the day later.  I have no had one cheat moment, not one puff of a cigarette, I feel like a million bucks.  I've saved nearly $8k, continued to exercise, I'm feeling better than I have in a long long time. Its very typical to say ""if I can do it, so can you"" but its really the case. I was as addicted as you can be to cigarettes.  What it really took was being actually and truly motivated.  Not quitting because you've been told to, or nagged to, or feel like you should quit but don't really want to.  All of those will fail.  For me, the difference was genuinely not wanting to smoke anymore and doing whatever it was going to take to make that a reality.

I decided to quit once way back in May but after a week or so, I relapsed and started smoking again. Around 15th of July, I decided I’ll try quitting again and honestly the withdrawals weren’t too bad but it did hit me exactly 3-4 times when I was in my lowest of lows and yes, I admit I gave in and smoked one cigarette around 21st of July. I remember feeling super guilty about it and couldn’t finish the whole thing before flicking it away. I again began my quit journey and this time I’m proud to say that I’m 23 days smoke free.
I just wanted to post this on my favourite reddit page as reading your stories have truly motivated me to stay quit free. 
I usually didn’t believe in signs, but I want to share this one experience that I had this week. I was craving for a cigarette really badly and told my friend to get me 3 cigarettes (in case of a rainy day). Believe it or not, we had to cancel our meet 4 times, as it has been raining heavily in my city and also due to the fact that his mum fell ill. I’m going to take this as a sign and stay on my resolve of not giving into the cravings and staying smoke free.
The thought of smoking does linger on my mind as all of my friends who send me the occasional snap streak, smoke. But whenever this happens, I chant these 4 lines that I read somewhere online, and each time I say one line, I take a deep breath before moving on to the next line;
“My lungs need air not smoke.
My stomach needs nourishment not nicotine.
My muscles need stretching, not cigarettes.
My brain needs a stimulation not a stimulant”
Chanting these aforementioned lines really helps me deal my cravings. Picking up a new hobby also helps, a lot. I chose to learn embroidery and line drawing while going through my quit journey and it really kept me distracted throughout the day.
I also started working out at home and with each passing day, I can breathe better and I’m not tired even after an hour and a half workout.

I don’t know who wants to hear this, but I just wanted to say this that: I know it is hard, I know it’s scary, but you got this. You’re a brave person and you’ve a strong willpower. You can deal with the cravings and you can do this for yourself.

I smoked since i was 17 and now at 42 and,smoked a pack a day, i am TAKING my life back. My quit day was August 1st 2020. I just walked in and said screw it threw them away and started the chantix i had laying on my desk for almost a year. I have not had one smoke since.

I have been debating it for a few years but always made excuses not to quit. One example was i had a major knee surgery, partial replacement, and was on chantix then but in my mind the opioids were making me crave the cigarettes and i couldnt fight it and was a complete douche to my husband so i quit the chantix and went back to smoking. I constantly made excuses to continue that few minutes of dopamine in my head, that few minutes of satisfaction. I am now done with that stuff.

I'm free!!,"I thought it would share my experience and see if people find similarities and hopefully help some trying to quit! Because it's worth it. Sorry for long post.

I have been smoking on and off since I was a teenager mostly social smoking until starting uni around 7 years ago eventually I was smoking 7 a day! However I was in denial as I never identified as a smoker. I would say to myself ""I can give up when ever, I'm not addicted""... I was/am addicted. 

My reason for quitting is I have become petrified of cancer due to a family diagnosis, and I started freaking out at the slightest issue with my lungs. So I decided to quit cold turkey 1 month ago and haven't had a puff since.

The benefits have been amazing so far and so worth the hard times. Day 3 was particularly hard due to nicotine cravings, after this the cravings lessened. Week 3 was also hard as I was very irritable and generally had an unstable mood this lasted around 2-3 days. 

I still find I have cravings mostly when out with friends I used to smoke with who still smoke, this can be difficult but I have to remind myself that the cravings are talking and they are not logical somehow they seem to make smoking again sound like a great idea, but I ask myself ""what good will I get from smoking?"" Which is a difficult question to answer, because it's all bad. I always feel great after surviving a craving smoke free! I also read articles about how bad smoking is for you to top up my willpower, for example did you know tobacco has radioactive metals in it... Scary stuff

Since quitting the most noticeable benefit has been lack of coughing and breathing is altogether easier; my lungs feel healthier and more responsive when I breathe. One benefit I didn't expect is much better sleep quality and the ability to wake up more easily in the morning, has anyone else experienced this? I have not read about this one anywhere. 

I can't believe I have made it 1 month! I have tried countless times to give up and lasted maybe weeks at best. This is the longest I have been smoke free in around 15 years! I find myself seeing people smoking and thinking I'm so happy I am no longer a slave to my addiction, remembering times I would smoke almost out of control of my actions knowing full well I didn't want to be doing it but lighting up and smoking anyway. I feel great for not smoking healthwise and also great for starting to get a grip on this devious addiction. I really hope you can too, it's very liberating.

Tldr - quit smoking, it's not easy but its definitely worth it. But I think you already know that. Quitting so far for me is a mind game more than physically difficult.

I was confident in my ability to have one and be done again forever because I truly was happy to be a non-smoker and never craved them. But I smoked it and it felt amazing. I got that head rush that you get when you don't smoke for a long time. I had a few, woke up the next morning and shrugged it off and thought, ""Ok, fun, but don't do that again"". Next time I had a few drinks around smoker friends, same thing happened. Rinse, repeat. Here I am one year later and I purposefully buy cigarettes every time I know I will have a drink.

Sharing with you in hopes it’ll help someone else.,"I am 36. I started smoking when I was 14. I started because my brother, 3 years older, smoked and I wanted to be “cool” and smoke too. We were not close and I guess I was trying to do whatever to somehow build a bond. And we did once I took up drinking, smoking cannabis and cigarettes, and partying with him and my cousin. 

Anyways fast forward to today and at 36 I can finally say I feel the best I’ve felt about quitting and here’s what I did. I planned my quit date. My last day was 7/12. My son’s birthday. He’s never liked me smoking and I’ve always gone out of my way to keep it away from him. He asked me many times to quit but kind of gave up on it. So I know my health is reason enough to quit but having that other big reason helped motivate me. 

I started with the nicotine pouches. 8mg nicotine in each pouch. I kept those with me and used them only when the need was great. If you go through a whole pack of them in a day that’s fine. The key is to not smoke at all. That was my first thing. I wanted to break the habit of not smoking. Yes we’re addicted but we’ve conditioned ourselves to smoke due to environmental triggers be it stress, relaxation, socializing, etc. In the past I was always fighting the cravings and resisting because I didn’t properly fill my time in the day that I would normally spend standing outside and smoking in my spots. We all have our spots. 

So this time around I fed the addiction part using the pouches and then changed some things in my daily routine to fill that time I used previously. I spent time organizing in my house and I am not good with organizing. I did some DIY projects. I take walks on my breaks at work. I have always loved cooking and spend more time exploring that. I can taste food differently and better now. After a month I am down to 1-3 pouches a day. My next pack will be the 4 mg as I’m just using it to now fight the addiction part and slowly wean off it. I smoked cannabis as well and can’t even do that anymore. 

I hope someone finds it helpful. I can’t say it’ll work for everyone but I’ve quit and started back numerous times and this has been the best experience in quitting in terms of ease. I honestly don’t miss smoking at all. I didn’t believe that it was possible. 

Feel free to ask any questions. I’ll share what has and hasn’t worked for me. But really it’s about trying to help and educate the community here to help us break this terrible and expensive drug.",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.48555928}"

When i quit smoking recently for 4 months I read this sub and encouraged others but didn't actively use it as a quit strategy.

I hate smoking. I hate the stink and the taste. I hate that I have blown my 4 months. I hate that it feels like an obsession and compulsion that I can't resist. In AA people talk about drinking against their will. That's how I feel with smoking at the moment.

I can't imagine trying to get a few days up, let alone a week.

I got back to anywhere between 9-15 a day. For a while I got down to only doing 8-9 pretty consistently, and then about 3 weeks ago I really started to cut back a lot. I slowly lowered the amount I smoked, and at this point I've only had 1.5 cigarettes per day the last 3 days. I smoke half a cig around 12, half around 5, and half around 9. It's like whenever I smoke one of the half's I feel worse for an hour or 2 and after that and some exercise I don't feel as bad. I'm trying to think about what my next step should be. I was thinking about lowering the amount I get a day again, but it's getting to the point where I am not smoking almost all day and I sort of just want to quit completely.

And the weather was good, and the alcohol kept flowing - and there I was, smoke free with a breath as clean as a baby’s. But soon after a few times we went out, one of them offered me one. And I took it and lighted it up. That was the start of a smoking streak that lasted 8 months. And now I quit again, cold turkey 25 days ago. Wish me strength.

I'm 22 years old and starting graduate school in several weeks. I started smoking in spring of 2018, and just quit 1 month ago to the day after 5 or so failed attempts. Since I quit a month ago, I've smoked 2 cigarettes, both while drunk in social situations. I had no problem staying off of it the following day, as I had no abnormal cravings. I really want to stay smoke free, but alcohol is my achilles heel. I'll certainly be drinking far less than usual due to the pandemic, so that's a plus. But my question is whether or not social smoking can still be done on occasion with drinks. I reckon that I'll inevitably smoke at least a few more drunk cigs over the next couple months, as the enhanced craving combined with the inhibited judgement makes smoking almost impossible for me to resist. My addiction has been relatively mild compared to some of the cases in here (roughly 1 pack a week in 2018 and 2 packs a week in 2019/20), so I suppose moderation could be easier for me than for some. I'm curious what y'alls experiences are in these types of situations. Thank you in advance",0,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4439021}"

I’ve been dealing with the break up really well; I’d had a ridiculous amount of anxiety about our relationship for a long time so us breaking up felt like such a relief and my anxiety reduced so much.

I've been chain smoking for 5 years now and I've reached a point where it's not even fun anymore and has become more of an annoying chore that dictates my life. I've tried quitting cold turkey but because of my diagnosis of bipolar and ADHD I started bordering into a state of psychosis as soon as withdrawls started kicking in. I want to try again, but instead just try to cut down how much I smoke each week or so until i feel I'm ready to quit completely. 

My biggest issue with this is that my study breaks and general self care revolves around smoking and even when I'm really not in the mood for a cigarette I feel incredibly anxious and frustrated if I don't at least force myself to smoke and as mentioned before I have ADHD so you can imagine my study breaks are quite frequent lol. 

I know a factor that makes recovering from addiction so difficult, aside from the chemical changes in your brain, is breaking the behavior that you learned from abusing. So I'm curious in knowing if anyone has any tips or experience on how to substitute or break this behavior? Or advice on how to preoccupy myself in my breaks that's short and requires me to get up. My roommate stopped smoking because of her finances and all she did was hold a cigarette to mimic that feeling, but I don't think I have the self control for that.

TL;DR: I want to stop smoking by cutting down on how much i smoke little by little, but because smoking has become a big routine for me I need advice on how to replace that habit with something equally as stimulating",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8024127}"

It’s not even a money problem it’s the dopamine receptors in my brain that are fucked up and it’s ruined relationships, friendships, my libido, and my teeth. I’m only 20. 

I will be on disability leave from work for the next 5 months (surgery, torn labrum) and I feel like now is the perfect time to quit not only nicotine, but weed, porn, and brainless internet surfing. 

If anyone older & wiser wants to give me some tips & such please. It would be much appreciated",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.388868}"

👉1. Question the Craving

When craving cigarettes, stop panicking and ask yourself:

 “What do I really need now?” 

 “What can I do instead of smoking that will make me feel better?”

The immediate response will be: “I want a cigarette; a cigarette would make me feel better.”

Don’t be contempt with that.

Search for the real emotional needs you’re trying to patch up.

A common state we (smokers, ex-smokers, non-smokers- in other words, all humans) are after is this: feeling relaxed and peaceful. 

If that’s the case for you too, you know what you have to do: focus on finding other ways to relieve your stress and relax.

You don’t need to use willpower to resist smoking. That’s painful.

The easiest way to stop a quit smoking craving is to redirect your focus on the reason you want to smoke.

And then think about other ways to feel better.

By the time you’re done the craving will be over.

👉2. Rename the Craving

During a craving, there is an internal dialogue taking place in your mind.

And it goes something like this:

– “I want a cigarette.”

– “You can’t have cigarettes.”

– “But I want to smoke” – and then it’s a matter of giving up or resisting and waiting fearfully for the next craving.

What’s the problem here? All of your thoughts revolve around the word “cigarette”.

And the words we use, affect our mind and our body. So the more you say the word cigarette, you will experience the craving more intensely.

The solution is to replace the word cigarette with another one.

Some examples are:“air”, “power”, “freedom”.

So next time you have a nicotine craving, keep saying: “I want fresh air.” – Use any word or phrase that resonates with you.

That’s how you will change the negative impact of your internal dialogue and, therefore, the way you experience your craving.

By changing the words you feed your mind with, you can change your emotional state.

Why?

Because our emotions are affected by the pictures we create in our mind.

You are not going to think of the same things if you use the word “cigarette” and “fresh air.”

So you will experience your craving in an entirely different way.

The power inherent in this exercise is amazing, and it will help you tremendously because it takes advantage of how your brain works.

Just try it!

👉3. Visualize the Craving

The moment you start craving cigarettes, picture yourself riding a wave. 

Your craving is the wave.

This wave rises in height along with your craving’s intensity.

Imagine this as high as you need. 

Focus on this image, the sounds, and the feelings.

Immerse in the picture and let the wave follow the ups and downs of your emotions. When the urge starts to slow down, the wave will go down with it.",39,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4538791}"

Can you really quit smoking without willpower? 

If you think it’s impossible to quit without willpower, then read on. 

Because the truth is that you don’t need and, in fact, you shouldn’t use willpower if you want to find quitting easy.

👉What Is Willpower
Willpower is two things.

✔ Willpower is a State of Resistance
Quitting smoking with willpower means that there is the urge to smoke and you go against this urge, you go against the desire to smoke.
Quitting smoking with willpower DOES NOT mean being decisive, strong, determined and making decisions like throwing your pack of cigarettes away. This decision-making process is essential part for any change and it doesn’t mean you’re quitting smoking with willpower.
The problem with quitting with willpower is that you’re going against your desire. You think of smoking as something that’s going to benefit you somehow but you don’t allow yourself to have it.
And of course this takes a lot of effort, it creates tension, it’s hard, and it makes you feel deprived. So you end up smoking more.

For example, if you experience a lot of stress and in that moment you try to resist a cigarette with willpower… what’s going to happen?
Well, it’s going to be very hard, you’re going to feel more stress and want to smoke even more. And even if you successfully resist the cigarette in that moment… you may end up smoking two or three consecutive cigarettes later because you felt deprived before. This is the hard way to go about your quit!
And I want you to know that even if you had superhuman amounts of willpower from birth or even if you practiced on increasing your willpower you would still feel deprived because willpower by definition means going against your desire, and that’s hard.

✔Willpower Is Limited
Willpower is not a manifestation or a sign of your inner strength.
We tend to think that if someone is a strong person that means that they have more willpower but that’s not always the case, that’s not what willpower is.
Willpower is like a muscle that gets tired during the day. The more you use it the weaker it becomes.
For example, if you have a chocolate cake in front of you and you see it in the morning when you’re rested it’s going to be easy to say “no”.

But is it going to be as easy after a hard day at work when you’re tired and hungry? Of course not.
And it’s not because you changed as a person; you didn’t grow weaker as the day went by. You just got tired, your circumstances changed and your willpower got fatigued.
And it’s the same thing with resisting cigarettes. You can’t always go against your desire with willpower because willpower is not dependable; it’s limited.
Willpower doesn’t work because willpower doesn’t last.
Everyone can resist a few cigarettes with willpower but for how long?
At some point you’re going to find yourself in a stressful situation and, you know, when we feel stressed our willpower gets depleted. And when your willpower gets depleted you’re going to fall back to old patterns and risk relapsing.
Also, willpower doesn’t work because you cannot use something you have a limited supply of like your willpower to resist something you have unlimited supply of like your emotions and your impulses and your urges. It’s hard, it’s not a fair fight.
And that’s why willpower can only cause temporary change. I’m going to tell you how to create lasting change in a bit .

⚠️When You Need Willpower

Willpower is not all bad it’s actually amazing and helps us do the right thing.
When it comes to making a change willpower can help you start something it can help you take the very first step. In our case it can help you start researching, watching a video, or start a program. However, willpower is harmful when you use it as the means to achieve a goal exactly because it’s a state of resistance and it’s limited.

For example, if you are on a diet it may need some willpower to throw all the junk food from the house or to go on the scale and see where you’re starting from. But you shouldn’t use willpower to stay on a diet because you will deprived and crave all the things you’re not supposed to be eating.
If you want to go to the gym you may need willpower to get up from the couch or get dressed but you shouldn’t use willpower to stay and workout because you won’t perform well, you’re going to waste your time and have a bad experience.
When it comes to quitting smoking, you may need willpower to start researching, watch a video or make small decisions but you shouldn’t use your willpower to resist cigarettes forever in the hope that the desire for smoking will magically disappear by itself. Because if you do, you’re going to feel deprived and end up smoking more.
So do you see now why you can’t go through life always resisting cigarettes with willpower?
This is not a way to live, you’re not going to be happy.
So what are you supposed to do?

👉How to Quit Smoking Without Willpower
Like I said a few moments ago, willpower means going against your desire and impulse to smoke and that’s the hard way.
But what if you change the impulse, what if you remove the desire to begin with?
Then quitting becomes easy!
And that’s what we mean when we say overcome the mental addiction. The mental addiction is the desire or need for cigarettes. It’s how smoking makes you feel and how much you believe you need it.
At the moment, you believe that smoking offers you something. Maybe you believe that it helps you cope with stress and boredom, socialize, concentrate, take a break or control your weight. And even though smoking offers you nothing at all… as long as you believe it does, you will desire it.
And the thing is that willpower does not remove the benefits you think you get from smoking and it doesn’t magically remove your desire to smoke. Because it’s hard to control our desires with willpower, our emotions don’t work that way.
And that’s why the solution is to let go of the emotions and stop desiring cigarettes. And you do that when you realize that smoking offers you nothing.
Think about it. Do you need any willpower to resist eating rat poison or ammonia or acetone?

Of course not! Because it’s disgusting and harmful.
Well, tobacco has inside arsenic that’s used in rat poison and ammonia and acetone and 4,000 chemicals and the only reason why you want it is because you believe it offers you something. That’s the mental addiction in action.
My point is when you see smoking for what it really is you don’t desire it anymore and when there is no desire there is no need for willpower and quitting becomes easy.

👉👉Conclusion
Willpower is a state of resistance and it’s limited. It’s good for starting things but bad for creating lasting change because you feel deprived, it makes the process difficult, and you may end up relapsing.
Willpower means going against the desire to smoke and this is hard. But when you overcome the desire to smoke, quitting becomes easy. And when there is no desire there is also no need for willpower.
To remove the desire for smoking you must change how you see smoking and quitting and that’s how you create lasting change and quit permanently.
So I hope this helped you rethink the role of willpower in your quit and that it gave you a new perspective.",0,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5914337}"

2020-08-06 20:27:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/i53rbi/cant_quit_smoking/,Can't quit smoking,"Hi Redditors!

This is my first reddit post and makes me sad that it is on this subreddit. Anyway, I have been smoking for exactly 2 years now, during final year of graduation. When I started, I was confident on my will power that it won't let me get addicted but no surprise to anyone else, I am addicted to cigarettes. I have tried quitting at least 5 times and the longest smoking free I have been is 7 days. 

After much contemplating, I was able to identify the triggers - anxiety, stress thinking about my career and work,  and depression. Then I realised these are the same emotional states I was going through when I had my first stick, making it even harder to quit. Now the stress threshold for craving a cigarette has lowered significantly- computer freezes for 1 minute while work, losing in a video game, getting rude/mean comment from someone... you get the idea. Before my mind could process anything, I find a cig lit in hand. 

I am worried that it is starting to have long term negative effects on my body and really want to quit. However, even at the sign of those triggers I am reaching out to pull one from the pack. Now I am starting to realize, I cannot do it alone. Being an introvert, seeking help from others, especially for a taboo where I live, makes it impossible for me to reach out for help.

I have tried exercising as proxy to smoking but injuries don't allow me to push hard at all. This injury ended my athletics participation, being captain of the university team which stresses me out immensely. And eventually I end up smoking again. Country where I live don't have communities to help quit smoking. So feel like I am all alone in this journey. 

I have set ""Day 1"" of quitting on this monday giving some time on weekends to finalize the plan. Going through other posts in this subreddit, I realise nothing can help me except my determination to quit. But I feel sharing these thoughts and listening to quitters' thoughts might just help me in coming up with an actionable plan and sticking to it. Any tricks on overcoming the triggers I mentioned would be much appreciated.

How can I help her quit again?,"Hi Everyone. I just found this subreddit while looking for some advice on our current situation. I hope you have some tips for me. 

We both decided to stop smoking this February. It was her initiative, but I was more than happy to join her as I have been stopping and starting a lot the past few years, while she has been more of a full-time smoker. 

Our motivation was a mixed bag of reasons, health issues is imminent as we are in our mid 40:s, tired of smelling bad, tired of having this nasty habit, and maybe most of all tired of how pathetic it is that two grown adults is hiding our smoking from our parents. (They probably know anyway...) 

All went well the first four months. We were very proud and talked often about how happy we are that we don't stink anymore, have to worry about what our neighbors think about the smoke, that we don't have to worry that oru parents might do a surprise visit, how her cough has become much better etc. 

But then about three weeks ago she started Taking Walks. Corona virus has ensured that we both have been working from home since March and Taking Walks has not been a part of her daily schedule until this point. 

Taking Walks has  been the way we have solved our nicotine needs when we have visited our families in the past, so I know what Taking a Walk means, especially when you also bring your handbag. 

I am not proud to admit it, but when I first started to suspect it, I squeezed her handbag to find the contours of a pack of cigarettes in it. So, I know she smokes, but at she is hiding it from me it can't be more than 2-3 cigarettes per day as the number of Walks you can take per day is limited.   

I don’t know where to go from here. I don’t want to tell her that I know she is smoking, because I am pretty sure that she will “surrender” and start smoking full time again. This has happened previous attempts. As long as she hides it from me she needs to limit the number of cigarettes per day. 

I can’t see any particular trigger that made her start smoking again, she is less stressed now than in the beginning of the corona clusterf\*ck, no additional stress over work, no bad things going on with family or with the relationship as far as I know.

I was told it takes 5 years to change your thoughts, and 10 to actually change your actions. Your body creates new cells every 5 years completely, I was also told, and I think that is a good way to link the physical to the mental. 

I'm going to quit once I finish this pack. I wish I didn't have it since I feel really fired up from realizing that the above statement needs to be taken more seriously.

&#x200B;

In these times, you realize what is essential. And health is number one. Save your money, save your body, save your time, save your family and future children, etc. Keep the positive thoughts going and rolling, change your perspective, and take a hell of a lot of deep breaths and MOVE. You crave a cigarette because you want a release, go walk or run for a short bit so you're breathing more oxygen in, and can get addicted to that instead. 

Normally I can quit things cold turkey once I decide. I realized that from the stress and having the crutch of saying ""oh I have stress"" or anxious or whatever- I am not progressing. Change the perspective into something positive, where I feel good after the thought, and so instead of ""oh I have stress"" I should think, and maybe you who read this, can take a deep breath and think ""i'm okay."" 

Truly, if you are alive and breathing then you are okay. Everyone has suffering yet, it's like we all just cling to it and it shapes us forever. 

But fuck that. 

Grow up, change, reevaluate, and learn.

* The odd crack in my voice if i was talking a lot. Completely gone now! 
* Panic if i realized i only had a limited amount of cigarettes left for the evening. No need to haul my ass out of the door when i’d rather snuggle on the sofa. 
* Smoking in front of an open window even if hail or snow was coming down. Never again! 
* Doubt if at a party on whether to smoke or not. Now i don’t even think about it if someone lights up next to me.

To motivate and hold myself accountable, I also wrote down my personal reasons off the top of my head.

I know It's a bit of a shallow reason to finally take action, but hey

I also suggest if you haven't tried to externalise your desire to quit smoking that you'd do so. Whether you're quitting cold turkey or progressing at a slower pace, you can't give yourself an out. Being actively reminded of your obviously valid reasons to quit, keeps you on track. And remember that when It comes to quitting smoking, any reason is a good reason. All that matters is that you care.

Anyway,

My reasons to quit smoking:

I want to have the best teeth and smile I can get

I want to run, do gymnastics and springboard dive like I used to, and continue to do so the rest of my active years.

I want to be free of disease

I want to be free of gassy stomach, fatigue, nausea, mental withdrawals.

I want to be able to focus for more than 30 minutes at a time

I want my sense of smell back.

I want my sense of taste back

I want to keep up the pace and be competitive.

I want to be there for the people around me

I don’t want an excuse to avoid uncomfortable or awkward situations

I want healthy friends

I want a healthy girlfriend

I want healthy kids if I choose to have any

I don’t want the shame of willingly walking towards a meaningless death hovering over me every time I even think about smoking

I want a healthy clear, clean voice

I want healthy skin

I do not want to throw away my hard earned money for something that literally poisons me, also haltering my development in pretty much every area of my life

I don’t want to be in an almost constant state cognitive dissonance, I want to respect myself and my own conscious decisions.

I don’t want to depend on anything or anyone

Not necessarily because I wanted to but because I had to. Let’s just say trying to have a baby is hard when you’re a smoker.

It’s just all too much at once. Sometimes I feel like smoking is the least of my worries right now. Idk. Just ranting at this point.

1. People have anniversary dates of when they quit, not anniversary dates of when they started.

3. The smell of smoke repels most people instead of attracting them. 
4. Kinda goes off number 3, but no one will be attracted to you because you smoke. If anything a person is more likely to not be attracted to you BECAUSE you smoke. When I used to smoke and go on dates, I would never have a smoke unless the girl did. Even the girl was worried about it being a deal breaker. 
5. Most of the time that ""stress"" that smoking will relieve is just the stress of nicotine withdrawl. 
6. This may not apply to everyone but you won't have to worry about hiding the fact you smoke from people because you don't do it anymore.

Of course it's healthy. But I'm having doubts if it will get easier or not. These past 3 days were like hell. My sleep cycle is broken, I have no focus at all. Every little problem irritates me. It felt like 3 months rather than days. There were just moments when I forgot about smoking, but just moments. Not even hours.

When I smoked, all my racing thoughts slowed way down, my anxiety went away and I went into a nearly meditative state.

Like nearly everyone, I am working through emotional issues rooting from my childhood which can give me anxiety or just make me unhappy so being able to be mindful and just live in the moment, was a few minutes of heaven.

It wasn't until I realized that this was the reason I would turn to smoking and accepted this that I was able to quite for good. And it felt relatively easy compared to previous attempts because I understood the why and was able to replace smoking with something healthy. For me, I started getting really into craft coffee and specialty tea's and found a tea shop down the street in my city.

I found this does the same thing for me, brings me into the moment and calms my mind. When I can focus on the smell, the taste and the healthy feeling both coffee and tea give me, it feels like meditation.

I know there are other aspects to smoking but this is was worked for me and it made the process almost completely painless. I know it is different for everyone but it might be beneficial to try to find the reason why you smoke and attack it from that direction and simply replace it with a healthy practice that accomplishes the same thing. For me, it was mindfulness and calming my mind so craft coffee and tea does that same thing! I am even getting into meditation and working on being mindful without coffee and tea but I suck at the moment haha! Maybe someday :)

Just wanted to share something that worked for me and I hope that it might help someone else quit too. If you are quitting, just know the desire to smoke goes away eventually and it helps if you ditch your friends who are not interested in quitting also and spend more time with those who don't.

Hope this helps someone!",16,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5820426}"

2020-08-02 05:57:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/i29nr2/weed_and_tobacco/,Weed and Tobacco,"Today's officially Day 8 for me, and WOW.. I would have never known that I could feel this strange.  Been on Juul, Cigarettes, and medical marijuana for a few years now.  Quarantine really upped the ante and I found my days starting to blend together and my overall productivity decline due to my increased consumption, so that was my catalyst for quitting.  These past months I've graduated from having my joints be a late night treat, to bong rips, concentrates, and spliffs every few hours everyday, even during my remote working hours, so I was a heavy, daily smoker.

I was expecting to have intense cravings for tobacco, but I'm very glad to say that I don't!  Maybe once a day for a minute or two, I'll experience that tingly feeling you get when you're gearing up for a cig after not having one for a while.  Not a big deal though.  I know I'm not in the clear yet by any means,  but the weird thing is that this seems to be my most MILD withdrawal symptom thus far.

What I have been experiencing however is frequent dizziness, minor hot/cold flashes, increased sweating, minor constipation, nausea that seemingly comes from nowhere, minor insomnia, and extreme fatigue.  I went golfing last Sunday, and could only play a few holes before I had to leave.  I was on the verge of fainting due to heat exhaustion (it was 95º, dry desert heat), but this has never once happened to me before (been an athlete for the better part of my life, and was still very physically active while smoking).  I was experiencing all of the things I mentioned above, and I still am to a lesser degree.

I'm hoping to reach a couple of you who may have once been in a similar position or currently are in the process of quitting both weed and tobacco.  Here are a few of my questions:

1. Does quitting tobacco/pot simultaneously compound the effects of both of their withdrawal symptoms?  Some people will say no physical withdrawal from pot, but I'm calling B.S. on that.
2. Besides things like exercise, increased hydration, breathing exercises, and healthy eating (I am currently doing all of these), are there things I can do to combat the physical withdrawals symptoms I'm feeling, or perhaps speed the process of recovery?
3. What are the reasons why I get nauseous and dizzy out of nowhere?  What solutions (preferably natural) are there for these specific issues?
4. Do certain supplements, nootropics, herbs, drinks, etc help get my brain and body back to it's pre-smoking state faster?  (chemically speaking)
5. Are there any other tips or recommendations from someone who made it past these first few weeks of withdrawal?

TLDR; When you quit weed and tobacco what helped you with the nausea, extreme fatigue, and other common withdrawal symptoms?  And given that I was a daily smoker for over a year, when could I expect the physical symptoms to wear off?  + ANY other advice you may have :) Thanks.",1,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4941777}"

I always said that I do not want to quit because I enjoy smoking. But this has changed in the last month. After staying at home for 6 weeks straight  due to Covid I become more happy and grounded.  I was struggling with a mild depression . Now I am happy with myself and I think I am in a place where I can turn my life around and quit some bad habits. 

So today I took the decision to try to quit smoking,  but to my surprise  the first thing  after I took the decision my body entered in a restless state and craves for a cigarette . 

Why? 

Do you have some tips and tricks to help me fighting these carvings?

I used patches exclusively up until a couple days ago when I decided 6 months was probably enough. Kind of expensive, but worth it. It meant that even when the pandemic hit, and I was stressed AF, I just kept putting a patch on each morning. Business as usual. 

There are times I would kill for a smoke, but, it's not the same this time. I don't want to smoke. I'm an addict, I can't have just one or two on weekends. 

I highly recommend patches as a way to quit. Honestly, it was painless. I know people are rabid about the Carr book, it didn't do it for me.  🤷

Oh, and tape the damn patch on with some clearish medical tape. I did that every day for 6 months. They wouldn't stick to me. I used Nicoderm and Habitrol patches. Two months at 21mg, 1 month at 14mg, and coasted the last 3 months on 7mg. You don't have to use them this long. When covid got real, I decided I would just keep using them to ensure success. 

As a bonus, patches were great for my focus, and I think they lowered my anxiety.",9,"{'pandemic': 1, 'covid': 1}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.39817348}"
