I'm so freaked out by reading some of the posts on this sub from people who relapsed/still have cravings after literally years. I thought if I could get through say 3 months that that would be it.

On the plus side today I bought a nicotine throat spray (for the chemical addiction) and some mini lollypops (for the ""hand to mouth"" addiction) to help when I eventually get one of the intense cravings. So at least I have a plan.

I am not sure if it is specifically linked to chewing the gum, but that is really the only change in my life that has happened over the past two months. Yesterday, I decided to start using 7mg patches instead of the gum because I don't want the problem to get any worse if it is caused by the gum.

27 now, and my smoking habit really solidified around 18-19. So almost ten years. Cigarettes (ranging from 2-10 cigs per day, depending on alcohol) until 2 years ago when I switched to juul. The nicotine addiction got way out of hand with the juul, and my sister works at a hospital where she sees young people with lung injuries from vaping. She was on me about it, while I thought I did the right thing by switching over to vape from smoke. Anyway, I ended up finding a coupon for Nicorette and just went for it. I want to have kids, after all. 

It's been one week today. I've cried a few times out of frustration and have felt super depressed (already experience depression, but medicated). Last night I was gaming with my buddies though and experienced some type of...release, is the only way I know how to describe it. I was tired and stoned (still smoke bud) and just laughed and laughed and didn't feel empty or agitated. Then I wondered, have I felt this type of elation with nicotine? Or is this some type of sensation that nicotine would cloud over? That doesn't make sense. I don't know, but I saw the light at the end of the tunnel. Where the world isn't just ""me surviving without nicotine,"" but me being *happy* without nicotine.

&#x200B;

I had my last bit of tobacco on March 15 this year. I quit because of two reasons: Covid-19 scare, and I used to smoke a lot of spliffs (so weed + tobacco) and it kinda got out of hand. I figured that the tobacco part was the more addictive part, so I cut that out (cold turkey) and I immediately noticed that I didn't really like smoking weed that much anymore. I now only smoke weed like once in one or two weeks and it's only half a joint each time. A few weeks ago I accidentally took a hit from my boyfriend's spliff (looked exactly like my joint) and I immediately noticed the nicotine hitting me lol. Didn't take any more hits but I was bummed because it kinda felt like I failed the whole quitting thing, though it wasn't my intention. This happened September 9. My urge to start smoking came back veeeery lowkey but haven't acted on that urge yet.

&#x200B;

Now I've struggled with ocd and adhd my entire life. I was on medication (Prozac and a long-release Ritalin) until July 2019 but quit, with my GP's assistance, because I felt like I was ready and I was done with the side-effects. This went really well! But I feel like smoking kinda kept me going and made sure that my anxiety didn't return. Once I quit smoking the anxiety hit me, like really badly. I figured that it'd go away on its own. I read that the anxiety from quitting smoking usually goes away after about three months. It's been longer than six months now and I'm not seeing any improvement. I feel like the whole 'your anxiety will reduce once you quit' doesn't really apply to me. I'm seriously considering going back to smoking until I find some healthy coping mechanisms for my anxiety, as this has had a very intense impact on my social life, my relationship with my boyfriend and my general life/health. I feel absolutely awful and I feel like I've also gotten depression along with it (while I never suffered from depression before).

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Quit smoking 6 months ago, anxiety still hasn't gone away, considering picking it up again until I have the resources to deal with my anxiety (and then quitting again).

&#x200B;

PS: I started smoking in November 2018, at first lowkey but after a few months it started to become a real habit. So I smoked for about a year and a half.

&#x200B;

PPS: Quitting smoking wasn't too hard. I was pretty agitated for the first week but after that no real cravings or anything, even though I was still surrounded by smokers because most of my friends and my boyfriend smoke. I think that if I were to start now, that quitting in the future won't be that big of an issue. The anxiety started creeping up weeks after I quit and has gotten very bad with time.

&#x200B;

PPPS: I have my first appointment with a psychologist since years next week, although this probably won't be my main therapist as they're going to look for a suitable treatment for me. So the plan to get better is working but I really need to get my shit together by smoking for now as I can't live like this any longer.",10,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.75319856}"

Feels like it's gotten harder, rather than easier. But nothing impossible. Still doing patches, but laid off on lozenges, having just one or two per day, if even that.

Do patches work? Yes. Have I slipped? Not really. Few puffs from e-cig while drunk few times, but it didn't do much when I *was* smoking and doesn't seem to do any now, so I don't even count it.

Still getting dreams where I smoke. Still getting very intense dreams overall - sleeping has became pretty much second life full of weird, bright  adventures. Appetite is absolutely through the roof, I'm gaining about a kilogram per week, which is incredibly worrisome.

Other benefits, like taste and smell, better physique, etc that are usually advertised... well, they're there... but nowhere as much as I imagined. Let's say that quitting smoking is like a magical RPG item that gives about 2-5% (pretty negligible) bonus to all your ""stats"", but also gives you a curse of becoming fat. Increase in sense of smell and appetite are most visible, everything else, I'm not really sure. A little.

Smell is funny in general; I can smell a cigarette like a mile away. Literal mile. I could apply to police to catch underage smokers or something, because when I bike around the city, I feel like I'm a bat, triangulating not by echo, but places people smoke at.

First month, I had very little cravings. Second month, they're pretty damn strong. And I still sweat a lot from patches. The unexplained-by-science pain and soreness in inner mouth and gums happened, but luckily just few times. Otherwise, there's no bad side effects.

My chronic allergy/sinusitis situation has disappeared. I actually hate this - in terms of belief, because it has no scientific basis. Multiple doctors with degrees and experience have diagnosed that it was due misaligned nose, and ""smoking does it"" is sort of pseudoscience your mom tells you. Yet... I have no more sinusitis. Relieved symptoms due less irritation from smoke, I'd take it. Totally gone? Just like this? Magic. Superstition won and my rational, science-based world view is crushed a bit.

But boy I'm glad it's gone.

Money. When I buy pack of 7 patches, I notice how insanely expensive it is. But those last for 7 days. And if I think how much 7 days worth of cigarettes cost me... hey, I'm saving a lot, even **NOW** (I spent about 6€ on cigarettes per day - 42€ a week. Weekly pack of patches costs 16€)

Mood swings are insane, but they were as bad when I was smoking, so I can't really tell. I think majority of problems lie somewhere else so I can't really measure the difference. I do have better days more often, and it's hard to argue that confidence boost from quitting probably did a lot of good.

I don't have doubts. It's not easy, but it's very well manageable. 22-year old unwashable yellow patch between my fingers has pretty much disappeared. None of my clothing smells bad. Nor hair nor anything else. 

And I'm not a slave. That matters the most. It was worth it. If anything's gotten really *worse*, it's that I'm starting to forget how miserable I was when I *was* smoking.

I have been a smoker from a young age, from around 12 and up until now, at 25. I have quit cold Turkey before for more than 3 months and found it not too bad, usually by the end of first week I'm done with the hardest part and can live smoke free easily. Why I go back is a whole other topic. 

Anyway, I am having major difficulty this time, I am exactly 3 weeks in and it has not gotten easier. It is definitely not as intense as the first 5 days, but still I've never had that before. Unfortunately, I slipped and had a few last night. This is really stressing me out, and I am starting to catch myself snap at loved ones, which is bad of course. Has anyone had an experience like that? Are some quit attempts cold Turkey easier than others? I don't know why it's taking so long for the mental games in my brain to end, I would have thought 3 weeks was enough to reduce this never ending anxiety.

TL;DR have quit before quite easily, this attempt has my climbing at the walls 3 weeks in, it should be easier but it isn't, why?

I switched from smoking to vaping maybe 3-4 years ago, with no intention of ever quitting

either late last year or early this year I got tired of vaping and wanted to quit, so I got some chantix from my doctor and tapered my nicotine down to none, thinking once I got to no nicotine I would vape less and get bored and stop, but the oppisite happened, when I get down to no nicotine fluid I vape more then I used to, I vaped no nicotine fluid for a few months before I tried smoking some cigars and got myself re hooked on nicotine

so I switched back to a 6mg vape for a month till I got the smoking out of my system, then did the exact same thing a second time, tapered down to no nicotine fluid, vaped that for a month before I got re hooked on smoking

so for a third time I switched back to a nicotine vape, then I started to taper down again, this time the plan was just to taper to low nicotine, not to 0 nicotine, cause I was afraid of getting hooked on smoking if I tapered down to 0mg again

but when I got to 1mg/ml where I was going to stay, it felt like I wasnt getting any nicotine, so I just tapered down to 0mg again, I have been at 0mg for a couple weeks, I guess I just got to be very careful not to start smoking again

but im still super addicted to vaping with no nicotine, which I fing strange, I guess Alan Carr was right when he said nicotine withdrawals are harmless, I didnt even notice any this third quit tapering slowly",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5243945}"

I knew my body would thank me but the benefits of decreased health risk seemed intangible and therefore a little less motivating (to me). 

Well, I didn't take before pics and I WISH I had. I quit 48 days ago and the difference is remarkable. 

I'm 34(f), smoked for 17 years, always had skin issues - acne, uneven skin tone, darker circles, the works. I started to look closer to 40 than 30 imho. 

When I quit, I was just hoping to mitigate some of the future damage. 

I'm thrilled to report that not only has my skin cleared up, I have NEVER had skin this luminous! Less than 2 months after quitting I have rosy cheeks, smooth skin, and sometimes do a double-take in the mirror because I naturally look like I'm wearing a beautiful berry colored lipstick. 

In less than 2 months I've started to look like I did at 29! I'm floored! 

My hair is shiny, soft, and manageable without a myriad of product.

My friends and family have remarked on how ""relaxed and healthy"" I look now compared to before. A friend I Skype with asked me if I had work done!! 

Keep in mind, I also take my vitamins, drink lots of water, exercise and get at least 7 hours of sleep. But all of those things are exponentially more effective now.

It's been now over a year that I'm trying to stop smoking. Last year in May 2019, I stopped smoking after 2 years of a really bad habit... I smoked near 15 cigarettes a day everyday... So I decided to qui:  I didn't touch a cigarette until last February, I was under a lot of stress for some personal reasons and I thought it would help me, but it just made a lot more stressed even at a rate near 2 little ones per day.. So in June I decided to stop again and back to uni' in September I started again (you know that good front of being with your friends and having a good coffee with them) but instead of liking I felt like it was bad.
I mean, yeah it's addictive, definitely: I can tell you it made me feel kind of dizzy and unwell, 45 minutes after one I needed another one to feel good and good is a very strange word to describe the lack of headache and warming... It wasn't a good relapse, I couldnt feel good smoking on a daily basis... So now I can tell you I have stopped..because I've never felt this feeling of finding a cigarette disgusting before.
Oh okay, my minde still tells me to smoke when I see someone smoking, but I know how bad it is... Let's say it's kind of seeing a perfect plaster cake, it seems good but you know, that if you out your teeth in it you'll break them all in little pieces...

Not one craving during the day. Instead, I was marveling at how much energy I had. It feels like a tremendous gift that I don't have to keep ruining my health. From now on, my athletic performance is only constrained by how much work I put into it and my physical potential. It will remain that way as long as I remember that I'm not giving up anything. Rather, I'm making room in my life to get almost everything back that I've sacrificed to nicotine.

I had a thought today. In all my previous unsuccessful quit attempts, I dealt with cravings by focusing on not throwing away the amount of smoke-free time I had. For example, I'd say to myself, I don't want to lose however many days by smoking now.

I realized today that isn't the best approach, for me anyway. I realized that it's not the past that I stand to lose if I were to smoke again, but rather the future. The past 50+ hours are done and in the books. Now what matters is all the potential futures I want to see later today, tomorrow, the day after that, and all the remaining days for the rest of my life.

 So me and my significant other have been smoking for about 4 years now and we desperately wanna quit. We tried the cold turkey method and made it to 3 days before we caved. We're pretty disappointed in ourselves, but want to use that disappointment to fuel a successful quitting attempt.

 We don't think cold turkey is going to work for us, so we want to try our luck with NRT (specifically gum and lozenges, I've had family with bad experiences on the patch). But we don't want to quit and then fall reliant on the NRT either, I see people talking about eating 10 pieces of gum a day for 6 months, and I see how that works for some people, but it sounds like a recipe for dependency to us. Part of our want to quit is easing the financial strain of it, and I dont want to just constantly drop the same amount on NRT that we've been spending on cigarettes. 

So if we were to buy a bulk pack of lozenges and gum, would we find effectiveness in trying to abstain but using NRT when cravings get really bad? Or will the occasional hit of nicotine only make the cravings worse if we try to stretch it out? Do you have an experience with NRT that you think would be helpful to us? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. We will do this! Thanks again.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5337244}"

I'm not quite sure if I can advertise my little success as ""smoke free"", as I am now vaping instead, but to me this is still huge! 

Before I've been smoking marlboro gold, usually around 40 cigarettes a day. I've been reducing my cigarettes down to about 20 per day since mid August. I really wanted to quit completely, but I was struggling so hard even with the 20/day so I thought I'd give vaping another try. Because I just don't have the money really.. each month at some point I end up choosing cigarettes over food, and I just want this insanity to end and my money to last longer for better things. I want my hair to smell good again, and my breath and clothes too. I want my health to get better, oh so many reasons to stop.

I've had a vape for a few months, it was a gift but it didn't have the form factor I was looking for, it had a button which was hard to reach and it was big, so every time I had to cram it out of my handbag. (In which it inevitably got dirty) so sadly I ended up not really using it. 

So I've been looking for a cigalike instead. For me it's less about the power but more about it being handy, small, stealthy, and something I always have at hand to play around with when I'm anxious/nervous.

I found the innokin I.O, and since it costs only 12€ it was finally something I wasn't too scared to buy! So now since Monday I've had my vape and I'm surprisingly satisfied. It's tiny but the tank lasts me half a day and the battery is lasting I'd say the whole day, and it has no button which is perfect. And I haven't smoked a cigarette since it arrived here! (Oh, and I have been using a 9mg liquid for now. If the cravings get worse I might try one with more nicotine.)

(Also a little ingenious discovery I've made: you can use the necklace /cord from your glasses (don't know the english word, sorry) and put your vape, in case it's a small/thin one, through both of the rubber ends, and then you can wear it like a necklace and have it always easy to reach.)


Sorry this is already getting so long.. But I've got one question to you guys:

Has anyone of you had this problem that since you started smoking you couldn't breathe properly through your nose anymore? Nowadays I always have a dry mouth when I wake up and get barely any air through my nose. It's always been not ok, but since I started smoking (at least that's when I think it began) it got ALOT worse.
(I've been to a ENT doctor and he told me I should stop smoking first and then I can come back and ask him again lol, which I am trying to do now.)

So, has anyone had a similar experience? Is there hope that my ability to breathe through my nose will become better again with time if I stay away from cigarettes?

I got my negative test result today and I need to go back to work tomorrow. I didn't usually smoke at work so I would dramatically oversmoke right before and after work.

as the title says, I quit smoking cigarettes Cold Turkey exactly 7 days ago. I had been smoking more or less for eight years. Not sure how many cigarettes/day exactly I smoked, but probably around 8-15, depending on various factors.

Since March, I had been on a 2 cigarettes per day routine (one after lunch, one after dinner), which worked very well. However, I let it slide during August, gradually returning to 5+ cigarettes. Hence my decision to quit.

Now. I quit 7 days ago. During the first 2-3 days, I was a little agitated and even slipped on day 4. I bought a pack of tobacco, rolled a cigarette, took two or three drags and threw both the cigarette and the tobacco away, kind of embarrassed and ashamed of myself. The nicotine didn't make me feel much better, so that only made me more determined to quit the daily smoking.

7 days after quitting and 3 days after that minor slip, I feel pretty good. Maybe my addiction wasn't so bad, but I have no trouble sleeping, concentrating etc. I sometimes think of smoking, but it isn't too bad.

My question: Will it get more difficult with time? I am a bit surprised myself that it was ""that easy"", at least much easier than I always thought it would be. But will the psychological addiction give me a hard time in the future?

Also (and I know this is something not usually encouraged, mostly seen as junky thinking and trying to find ""back doors"" into smoking again) I never planned to quit *once and for all*. I know that might sound a little stupid, but I always liked smoking, even when I wasn't smoking daily, so when I wasn't super addicted. From the beginning on I planned to stay off it for a couple of weeks and then maybe smoke one with friends or something. Might be a bad idea, but there is a curios thing I realized:

When I tell myself, ""You will never, ever, ever smoke again!"", I tend to tense up and become despaired. But when I tell myself, ""You may smoke again if you want to, just not today and probably not tomorrow – but when you feel like it, go for it"", I find it much, much easier. Anyone who had similar experiences?

Thanks for all replies.

After my GERD symptoms worsened over the last year, I knew that I would have to quit, as smoking always made my reflux worse. However, the main reason why I struggled with quitting was because of my PTSD. A cigarette was my go-to when I felt like I was losing control of myself. Nevertheless, I tried anyways. Needless to say, cold-turkey was not for me, and I ended up picking up a JUUL (my Gunny would be laughing at me right now) from a gas station after only a day. Went three weeks without a cigarette, then switched from the 5% pods to the 3%. After a week, I realized that I really wasn't enjoying it anymore, but I liked the minty taste the menthol brought, so I bought some gum. And just like that, I sit here typing this post, chewing a piece of gum and not craving a smoke. If you would've told me a year ago that I would quit this easily, I probably would've laughed in your face. It truly is a miracle. Plus, I have a new superpower that let's me smell a cigarette within a 10 mile radius, so that's cool.

If you stop smoking then the withdrawals will end (in due time).

I hope I feel this way forever. Even though not smoking feels really easy right now... if I did go smoke I would just end up stuck as a smoker for several more months or years or a lifetime. I would rather not deal with that and just be free.

Here’s how I quit and some advice from someone who did it recently.","So as stated in the title I quit, I quit because I was sick of smoking, I was sick of the sore throat, the persistent cough, difficulty breathing, disturbed sleep, wasting time and wasting money (not to mention the long term health effects). I’ve quit before but this time I was successful and I am now a non-smoker so I thought I’d share some things that worked for me.

1. If your country is currently in any sort of lockdown it is a great time to quit, majority of my friends smoke so I found the reduced interaction a blessing and a positive in my quit. You won’t have the temptations at bars and other social environments where you might otherwise break. Find time at home for new hobbies which can distract you and even better your life.

2. Your health at the moment is very important (it always is but with COVID smokers are especially at risk), smoking impacts this in many ways but to name a few reduced immune response, lung capacity and it’s abilities to heal itself and recover. It’s no secret that cigarettes also have other negative effects on your health and it’s good to remind yourself of them, so here’s a short list of the more important ones;
A) Reduces circulation.
B) Increases your risk of a heart attack
C) Increase risk of stroke
D) Reduces lung capacity 
E) Increases risk of cancer (essentially every type including kidney, liver, stomach, bladder, throat, lung, colon, oesophagus, colon and rectum cancer to name a few

3. At an unprecedented time such as this it is crucial to have savings as we are unable to predict what turns this might take and the economy is not in great condition at the moment. Where I live cigarettes are very expensive (30-50 for 25) with the money I’ve saved and been putting away I have felt more confident and secure, I now have saved 3 months rent which secures my housing in case any unforeseen events happen. Before this, I was essentially putting away a minuscule amount as the rest went to cigarettes rent and other necessities. Cigarettes are not a necessity and I have come to realise that. 

4. Create a “mantra” to repeat once three times daily, this mantra should highlight how you feel about smoking and why it’s detrimental to you, for example, mine was 
“Not one more puff, no matter what. Smoking is paying for pain, smoking is throwing money down the drain. Cigarettes are not your friend they cause you distress and trick you saying they’ll help it end. Cigarettes are dirty disgusting and cause a mess.” Of course it doesn’t have to rhyme and keep it short, it can be a helpful reminder when necessary or just to instil in yourself why you avoid them at all costs and don’t smoke them anymore.

Last but not least remember that cigarettes do not cure anxiety, nerves, stress and/or any other negative feeling you have, they in-fact create it and trick you into thinking they helped you, an example I like is if a bus comes late but still turned up every day that bus running late is causing you stress but when it turns up that stress is relieved. You might think that the bus is helping you but it is the thing causing you stress if it just came on time you wouldn't be stressed (this would be life without cigarettes).

I hope this helps as it helped me on my proper 4th quit and this time I’m certain I’m now a non smoker for good.",92,"{'lockdown': 1, 'covid': 1, 'immun': 1}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45534733}"

I know my weakness and yes I have a therapist. 


Some hx, I smoke 10-15 cigarettes a day for many years. This year, I changed my diet to Mediterranean and slashed drinking alcohol by literally 85% and OMG I am at my normal weight again for the first time in 5 years. Age 37, the great majority of my life I could eat w/e I wanted and stayed in the same weight range, after learning my heart's rest rate was too high (caused fainting) I had to take propanolol (low dose beta blocker) to keep my heart rate in check - a condition exasperated likely due to being a smoker. I blew up 20lbs in the first 3 months of that drug... and finally lost it with healthy eating and only drinking 3 drinks a week or none at all. 

I want to stop smoking AND acknowledge I maintain how I look to combat easily disrupted self esteem. 

I want share the reasons quickly for this decision; 

At my age I want to love my home, and because of smoking I have not bought any new furniture in 14 years due to the stink of smoke

It's a money sink, I live in NYC so it's 15$ a pack. 

I want to be able to be physical, I HATE working out and know that gasping for air is not helping this relationship (I hate working out).

About 7 years ago I DID quit for a hot second with the aid of a low nicotine dose vape pen, eventually a no dose vape pen, to being too lazy to charge the damn thing but then I started coughing so badly as my lungs purged the tar that it got in the way of working (I work one on one with people and the coughing was understandably off putting). The coughing also drove me bonkers. Point is, I think I can do it! 

I am the only smoker in my peer group and it's frankly embarrassing. 

Given that I have female pattern baldness in about 3-5 years it's gunna be wig o'clock and I don't want my quaff to reek of smoke. 

At 37 I am dead set on not having children, and in order to continue birth control I have to quit soonish.. an IUD is not an option for me.  

Tell me your story please!!!!! everything online says; 

1. You eat more (I won't) 

2. Your metabolism slows (I can't control that regretfully and only recovered from a slow down this past year).

It looks strange now sometimes reading here people struggling. Kind of a sense is being a long time since i start my new life style as a non smoker. The best i can say is, yes you will remember the feelings of sometimes it would feel amazing smoke one, but after 3 months you will be easily to control yourself and come with an answer to actually not smoke, instead of why you should, or could. 

So believe in yourself. I did not yet have one day that not remember the cigs specially since i use the app Smoke Free and everyday remember me to check if I did smoke or not. But at same time. Is now rare moments that I have any kind of urge and if and when is like for a second. Nothing like in first months.

So again believe in yourself. And after a while you will be too proud of yourself to even imagine light one. And yes destroy your reputation as a strong person that kick one of the worst addiction drug that there is out there and is very easy to grab. 

Not another puff, no matter what.

And in 3 month in you will be like 90% OK to be a true non smoker for life.

Next month I'm going to be alone at my moms , not have a lot of money but I could use it to my advantage to stop smoking, afraid of relapsing when I'm again with my homies through weed because everyone mixes it with tobacco.  Didn't smoke weed for 24 days and tbh I don't need it but my social circles are all up on weed and I'm too much scared to suck it up and seek change so I get addicted.. (Kind of easier to have some weed than just tobacco, but it costs a lot and a lot of stoner circles tire me, a lot of times it's weed>friendships, and the first week without weed always makes me feel angry more than I should feel... Would have smoked, but the last fact is keeping me sober for a while)

When I got a construction job, just like the year before on easier job my father told me you could smoke weed, just get a job, then he started attacking me for smoking weed after 9-10 hours of work. I mean he didn't even do anything when I was out of work, suddenly he started knocking on my door, giving me constant advices, threatening with police (even when I wasn't smoking) and not letting me relax.   I had a minor breakdown and decided to quit this summer after \~22 days .Some guy that is a fucking bodybuilder and does run regularly broke his ankle on the 3rd day of the job..

Father started attacking me hc for smoking weed after work because his childhood friend  said something rude to him and I was just too tired and had some beers to deal with his problems and go to sleep and repeat... I guess I can't handle his personality changes or even have a fucking job when I'm living with him. Even on the easier job I've done last year I mumbled to myself that it's more relaxing to be at work than home because I'm tired of constant philosophies.

If I continued to do that job the job leader who quit cigarettes would bash on me for the stuff that the kid of the main boss failed, I'm going to work for 3-6 people carrying stuff like the biggest idiot up and down for no reason and then get bashed on at home...

No..

My story. I was a chain smoker 3-4 years back and use to smoke at least 2 and 3 packs a day. One day I got lot of coughing and from that cough I could feel the smoke smell. May be it was my imagination but this came as strong signal to me that its time to stop. Suddenly faces of my loved ones started coming in front of me every time i picked cig from packet. Thoughts likes what my little daughter and wife will go through if I get some bad disease due to smoking. Isn't it that I am simply throwing my life away. Who is important this 20 cig pack or my family. I started to weigh and found of course family and my ambitions are most important. Immediately I decided to quit. Not with mild or ultra mild or reducing from 3 packs to 1. All these things never work practically. You simply have to take that stick away from your mouth , from your reach. I tried some products from nearest pharmacy and it helped. I forgot to mention in my earlier post those products were simple chewing gums. Overall today I am perfectly healthy, no coughing. Yes, cravings sometimes still comes up but now will power is built by time and I am much stronger.

My intentions are not to encourage use of nicotine products of any kind.

I've been smoking for 20 years and I'm literally getting sick to death of this habit. I started when I was 12. I'm now 33. 

I've tried hypnosis, patches, inhalers, vaping, cold turkey etc etc. Both of my parents, now in their 60's, still smoke as do two older siblings. 

A couple of weeks ago I caught the flu (don't worry, not covid) which morphed into a chest infection and almost progressed to pneumonia. I'm still recovering but I don't think my lungs will ever fully recover. There was a very frightening moment for myself and my partner just prior to going to the hospital where I couldn't breathe from all the coughing. 

A couple of days after the hospital discharged me I went to my GP and asked for help to quit. After a long talk about my mental health and who I have to support me (I have a few acronyms attached to me that make things interesting) she suggested Champix. 

The first week I was almost manic with my energy levels and moods. 

Yesterday I had heartburn, indigestion and over night I couldn't keep anything down. Today is much the same. 

Is this going to last? 

Can I do anything for it?

She did patches and nicotine gum for two weeks and is now using nothing, if that makes a difference. Does anyone have any experience with this?

May be it was my imagination but this came as strong signal to me that its time to stop. Suddenly faces of my loved ones started coming in front of me every time i picked cig from packet. Thoughts likes what my little daughter and wife will go through if I get some bad disease due to smoking. Isn't it that I am simply throwing my life away. Who is important this 20 cig pack or my family. I started to weigh and found of course family and my ambitions are most important. Immediately I decided to quit. Not with mild or ultra mild or reducing from 3 packs to 1. All these things never work practically. You simply have to take that stick away from your mouth , from your reach. I tried some products from nearest pharmacy and it helped. Overall today I am perfectly healthy, no coughing. Yes, cravings sometimes still comes up but now will power is built by time and I am much stronger.

I’m really happy with myself being able to stay quit for this long. I know I really relied on the posts on this subreddit to motivate me and give me a realistic idea of what to expect, more so than actual medical websites, so I thought maybe I should share my experience.

I initially quit on Tuesday but made the mistake of going out and having drinks the day after and smoking a cigarette. I was a little bummed but knew this would be a journey and knew what I had to do to prevent a relapse. I reframed my decision to quit not as a negative (i.e. “No smoking,”) but in a more positive manner, which is to declare war on my nicotine addiction. I know it sounds cheesy but it has worked to motivate me. 

Since my “war” is on nicotine and also because I really don’t think they work for me, I stopped using the nicotine patches. This isn’t a matter of feeling adversely with them they just don’t make a difference for me. 

Today and yesterday have basically been the same. I’ll have a craving once an hour. No lie I’ve been timing my cravings and the average length of my cravings is between 30 seconds to (rarely) 10 minutes. Today my fatigue is slightly worse. I took a three hour nap after sleeping for 8 hours. I’ve also been eating more, but I’ll let that slide because it’s a little easier to lose weight than it is to lose cancer. 

I’ve been a little bit of an emotional mess. One moment I’ll be happy and laughing and the next I’ll be fuming from something that didn’t even happen. And back again. Kinda funny, really. I work on customer service and let’s just say I haven’t been able to fully utilize my customer service voice like I am usually able to.

One major difficulty (aside from cravings), is how intertwined smoking is with daily habits -- your morning coffee, while driving, with friends, with a beer, etc. Even though you're trying your best, these moments still serve as triggers to make you crave a smoke. 

For the past year I've been working on a nicotine-free, tobacco-free, cigarette alternative. It looks and smokes like a normal cigarette, so you can satisfy the habit, while helping you curb your cigarette use. Ultimately, it should help you quit smoking altogether!

If you're curious, we use high quality, all natural hemp flower, which can help with the cravings (and even anxiety).

How you deal with that (with the cravings that might come from temptation)?   
Or you avoid them and risk loosing a friendship?   
I know they have to respect my choice, but also if I ask them to respect me, I have to respect them back. This is when friends are involved, because when its just regular people I can just leave.

I was one even before Covid-19, but it's been crazy stressful for me since Spring Break. Pre-pandemic, 3 out of 4 kids went off to school. My toddler and I just hung out at home and did the chores, NBD. Since school got messed up, I've been majorly stressed out. With the kids home all the time, they've been fighting more with each other (understandable), and me. I am very much a pacifist, so when they start yelling at me because I asked them to clean up their mess, I start to break down inside. (It doesn't help that I have PTSD, depression, and anxiety.)

So when it gets to be too much, I go outside and smoke. The kids know not to bother me when I'm outside (unless an actual emergency).

I've been a smoker for over 10 years. I want to quit, but 2 days in, my withdrawal symptoms emerge as snapping, yelling, generally angry, which doesn't help with the kids.

I've tried nicotine gum, patches, consciously changing habits (like forcing myself to wait to smoke until at least 3 hours after I wake up), but nothing has worked so far.

I know that a big part of me not quitting is knowing I get 10 minutes of peace at a time when I go outside.

Any advice?

P.S. My SO is no help. He just says he doesn't understand because he doesn't really smoke. He doesn't need it like I seem to.

I haven't soked since  the day I landed in Australia. Last time I quit smoking for couple of years (before picking up again) it was tough. This time it was really really easy and sort of just happened. The things that helped are, 

1. Moving to Australia. 
This has been the best thing ever. All the habits I have built up over the last 7 years in London didn't mean much since I moved to Australia. All the smoking breaks, smoker friends etc. I was so busy during the first month after the move that there was no time to think about smoking, quitting etc. 

2. Smoking policies in Australia.
Australian govt really don't want people to smoke. Cigarettes are prohibitively expensive along with ban on smoking in public spaces such as beaches. Even if I managed to buy a pack there are no good places to relax and smoke. 

3. Lockdown.
I have focussed all my energy during this lockdown on cooking and eating good food. Everytime I had free time, I cooked elaborate lunches and dinners. Helped to keep me occupied and not fall into old habits. 

So if you are moving houses, cities or countries, I would advice to take full advantage of the change in environment and build a non-smoking lifestyle around you. Also If you want to quit cold turkey consider a change of environment at least for the first few weeks.

As the title states, I am 19, and currently a student. I have been a pack a day smoker since I was 17 (smoking regularly since 14, cheap, easy access to cigs even though I was underage), and had used juul pods in between. I realize my nicotine addiction is pretty heavy, and for the past few months I really have been more aware of how much energy/money I spend on satisfying my nicotine addiction. I no longer want to be held down my something that makes me smell bad, makes me anxious and ultimately will make me less desirable when I start to date again. I have been reading Allen Carr's book for the past few days, it gave me a new perspective on smoking and I feel pretty encouraged to give it a go.   
Perhaps unrelated, but I am also thinking of kicking my heavy weed habit as well which has been relatively easy for me to do in the past (would this be too big of a task while trying to quit nicotine? or should I go big or go home?). Thank you to anyone who is reading this, I hope you can provide some words of encouragement, right now I'm still quite anxious (but excited) at the thought of finally being free from nicotine.

Of course I have tried to quit many times in the past over these 13 years, but quitting cigarettes cold turkey wasn't something I could do. Patches made my arm physically hurt, gum made me queasy, pills didn't work, and cheap vaping devices were rough on my throat.

On the 25th of May 2019 I quit smoking and switched to vaping with a higher end expensive vaping device. I went from 12mg to 6mg to 3mg and bounced around 0mg/3mg nicotine per mL of vape juice for over a year. I switched to vaping in hopes that I'd quit within a year, but it took a bit longer. Still reliant on nicotine I didn't consider myself 'quit' yet, even though it wasn't smoke. However, when a close friend of mine tried to OD and take his life in January of this year, I picked up smoking for 2 weeks out of the sheer stress - then went back to vaping. Brief, but still extra poison I didn't need.

Finally, on August 13th of 2020 I ran out of juice, ran out of coils for my vape, and decided.. it's actually time, really.

The first week was absolute hell. I wanted to punch things, I'd go from laughing to hysterically enraged at a moment's notice from random things, and mostly depressed. Kept trying to reach for my vape. Kept pacing around at 3am. I almost always went back to nicotine in the past after ~10 days. Longest I ever went was 3 1/2 weeks after starting 13 years ago. Now I'm at 32 days. Wild.

Eventually I stopped thinking about it as much after the 3 week mark. Still have cravings but it ends up being food or soda. I've gained over 10lbs in a month from picking up a soda habit again (yikes, I know - not a hydrohomie right now!) and not exactly eating healthy either, although I did become vegetarian once meat ran out from COVID. (Oh and don't worry, we have meat now; I stuck with vegetarian anyways. I discovered lentils are amazing.)

My takeaway? View nicotine as a drug like a hard drug that is super addictive and has no benefit to you at all aside from making you more addicted to it. You have to shake it off, and have patience. Lots, and lots, and lots of patience. I can revert my weight back much easier than quitting nicotine again.

As for Vaping? Well, vaping was a crutch, but not perfectly safe. The heat from it alone dehydrates you more than without, and also very slowly damages your gums and teeth, at a minimum - not even counting the (relatively minor, but potential) carcinogens from the vaporization process. Better than smoking, but ultimately should quit that as well if you can. You also still lose a bit of sense of smell with vaping because the glycol juice builds up a thin layer in your sinuses.

I don't feel like I'm quitting, even though it's still a recent past activity; I just don't feel like I'll ever want it again - I can't stand the smell anymore, or how much it costs ($200+/mo). Vaping still cost me $50-80/mo!

I finally feel free in every way.

Started smoking when friends and I had access to it, coughed like crazy but also liked the buzz, started doing it when I was stressed, it was maybe 4 cigs a day at first and now eleven years later I'm between a half-pack to a full pack a day depending on whether I drink or not.

This is my first attempt at quitting that feels like it's for me. Not for my parents, not for a girlfriend, not for some doctor who says you should really quit, but for me. It feels pretty hard just because the habit has gotten so out of control in the last few years. Dealing with four or five rituals / triggers is easier than ten-plus.

Something I've been trying is to think about what I did before I picked up the addiction. I started fairly late compared to a lot of smokers (18), and it kind of amazes me how I was able to get through life without this crap. Hundreds of cups of coffee that didn't require a cigarette. Great times hanging with friends without smoking. Killing time without a smoke, staying up late playing games / watching movies without smoking. Having a beautiful day without smokes, going through a horrible day without them. 

In some ways, it wasn't any different: life will always have its ups and downs, its memorable moments and its mundane moments. But reflecting on the totality of it, the addiction didn't add to anything. It didn't make the hard days easier or the nice days better. Sometimes I use the social aspect at bars as an excuse, but to be honest, I've never met a close friend by doing that. And all my close friends don't smoke (at most one or two will have a couple when drunk, but none is a habitual smoker).

Well just like that! Go and relearn how to do things without a cigarette. 

It's ok to be nervous, it's ok to be irritable. Go out and be busy, time flies by and you'll be smoke free sooner than later.

That being said I truly know, that all of you can do it! And please don't get discouraged on the way.

After a year of not smoking I still have dreams of puffing and wake up a little weirded out, because my brain still releases the good hormones when I dream of having one.
But that just doesn't outweigh the LUNG CAPACITY that I gained, omg. I thought I fucked up to no return, but a year of no smoking has made me do more healthy choices in my everyday life. I'm taking every step of the stairs and I'm not loosing my effing BREATH.

Surprisingly, my cravings had not been overwhelming me like they did in my past attempts to quit.  I suppose one big difference had been that I don’t go to bars anymore because of Covid, and because of that, I rarely drink at all anymore.  Well, about 4 days ago I bought a bottle of whiskey and got super drunk by myself and mostly just played piano but a few hours in, I got the biggest craving I’ve had to date.  I was so close to going out and buying a pack.  I remember feeling how strong the urge was.  Days after I’m still feeling that same craving.  I guess I’m stressed out about a lot these days ( I lost my job back in March due to Covid and since it was a job at a live event theater space, the job won’t be returning until at least next year).   I have about $8000 in credit card debt and without the federal boost in unemployment, I can’t get myself out of it.  Honestly, the lack of finances is probably helping me quit at least a little bit.  But the anxiety sure isn’t.  I don’t know why I’m writing this.  I guess I’m concerned by how strong these most recent cravings have been and by how fast having a drink flipped that switch on for me.

long-time lurker, first-time poster here.

I've been smoking since I was 13 years old. I'm 23 now and I don't even know where the time has gone. I've had multiple failed quit attempts over the past 10 years. 

The longest I've gone smoke-free was 3 weeks, after my first time reading The Easy Way. This was during my time in the Army (conscription) and also when I'd just transitioned into a pack a day smoker. The fact that the book made quitting feel effortless in an environment where smoking was the only way to get a break was beyond me. It was the greatest 3 weeks for my mind and body. However, at the 3-week mark, my dumb ass decided to test myself with a cigarette. But we all know it's never just one and I was back in the trap. That was 5 years go and I haven't been able to replicate the feeling of elation I got from quitting since. 

Recently, I found an audio version of The Easy Way and thought I'd give it another crack considering how well it had worked before. I took my time with it, re-listened to some chapters, and I'm feeling confident. I just had my last cigarette and have no intention of lighting up another again, not at any point, not even to test myself. 

Not many people around to hold me accountable, so I thought I'd come to the place that has given me some of the most useful advice on this topic. Thanks for reading, and good luck to all of you on whichever part of the journey you're at.",9,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.41455033}"

Okay well maybe not a 1000 times, for real, I've quit at least 20 times in my life. My initial quits some 10 years ago were motivated by reading some of Allen Carr's books. The longest I managed back then were about 6 months. But I would always end up going back again after events like drinking too much or getting angered and self-sabotaging my attempts. 

I eventually got myself to attend an Allen Carr seminar and quit for 8 years after that. Over the past year I’ve dabbled with taking  hits off friends vapes at parties etc. Without realizing I slowly slipped back into the trap, I started having the occasional cigar convincing myself that I can handle it now. The occasional cigar turned into every other day and before I knew it I was back to smoking cherry cigars on the daily. Not too worried I skimmed the book again and told myself it was easy then, it’ll be easy now. I managed to only quit for a week with my last attempt and bought cigars again after having a fight with my wife this week. 

Now I’m scared shitless I won’t be able to pull it off again. I agree with everything Carr says, listening to his audio book earlier today I have no doubt that there is absolutely no benefit nicotine provides. I’m not even sure why I’m making this post, guess I need some inspiration/motivation. So yeah that’s my story, back at the bottom of the pit, I ignored the final warning, I know. I feel a little bit hopeless this time around, the old Einstein quote that goes “trying to do the same thing over and over and expecting a different result equals insanity"" comes to mind. Anyway, smoking the last of my cigars today then I’m back at day one. Wish me luck, any pointers on what to do different this time around would be welcome.

The pills raise cholesterol levels plus the cigars.
I really want to stop. It gets super hard when I'm having alchocol and since I am working in caffe,everyone are smoking here. All of my friends smoke too.
I want to stop because of my health. But it is so hard. I also had a drug problem a year ago and I stopped I just said one day it is over. But cigars are the worst kind of addiction to me. I let go of everything bad in my life, dropped weight, started training and living better, but the cigars damn..
Ps. I am scared that I will gain weight by stopping smoking ( yeah I know it is stupid, but I was fat before and I don't want to gain it back)

I've been smoking for 9 years already, tried to quit smoking with help of a notebook - every time I wanted to smoke - I went ahead and wrote a text. This definitely helped, but for a few months only.

This time I'm going to reward myself for each week without a cigarette - this may be some shopping or a trip. I truly hope this is going to motivate me at least for the beginning.

I am looking for advice on getting my dad to stop smoking, I often hear him cough really badly and it makes me worry for him. I've tried everything, I convinced him to buy a vape as to replace the cigarettes (I know it's not 100% healthy but it's better and it was just as a step-down to eventually stop smoking at all). I've listed him all the carcinogens in cigarettes all the time, I've been near him while he smokes to tell him that the smoke is also affecting me so he could stop, I've tried making him call the number on the back of the box, thrown (and destroyed) his cigarettes, etc, etc.

after a few years of vaping I was starting to get tired of the hassle of vaping, I decided to try and quit, made a doctors appointment and I got some varenicline, tapered my nicotine level in half every bottle untill I was vaping no nicotine fluid

but I still couldnt put the vape down, I was just as addicted to vaping as I ever was, the only difference being is I felt better upon waking up in the morning, wasnt in withdrawals anymore

I vaped no nicotine fluid for about 2-3 months before I bought a pack of cigars, and before I knew it I was smoking ciggerettes, something I thought I would never do again

so I switched back to a 6mg vape to get off the tobacco, went back to my doctor, got another varenicline script, and did the exact same thing, tapered my nicotine down to 0mg, vaped that for a month, and after month I found myself bumming ciggerettes off of a family member who smokes

after a month of smoking, I switched back to a 6mg vape, tried to go to my doctor again, but she wouldnt give me the varenicline a third time, so I started to taper down again without it

im currently at 1mg fluid, and scared to hop to 0mg now, cause last two times I did it I started smoking again

even if I do cut the nicotine, it apparently does almost nothing for my vaping addiction, as I still chain vape the no nicotine fluid,like I said the only difference I noticed is I felt better in the mornings

 I think getting out of the hand to mouth habit might be key to not end up smoking again, I think the feeling of vapor in my lungs gives me a dopamine hit that keeps me hooked, I tried reading Allen Carrs book, but it focuses 100% on nicotine addiction, which I have already dropped twice and feel comfortable dropping a third time, the book dosnt even mention that something else could keep you hooked, and kinda even eludes if you think that you are in denile about nicotine addiction

Had a rough adolescence and young adulthood filled with drugs and heavy drinking.  Smoking was the least damaging thing I was doing.  I gave up drugs many years ago, and I recently quit drinking, so smoking is sort of the ""last thing I have"".

Lately I've been scared.  My wife gave birth to my very first child last year and my daughter is the light of my life.  Lately, with the fires in California, my breathing has not been good.  I feel like I can't take in a deep breath and this has never happened before.  I don't know if its just the air quality, or its just my anxiety, or if all of those years of smoking have really fucked up my lungs to the point where I am actually damaged for good.

I told myself I would quit tonight.  Told my wife, my parents too.  Drove back home without any cigarettes and a pocket full of Nicorette.  Then I was looking for something under my carseat and found a pack of American Spirits with three smokes left.  I said to myself ""well, at least I have them, just in case it gets bad, but I will try to quit nonetheless"".  Sure enough after dinner I wandered down to the car and had a smoke outside, as I could smell all of the smok in the air from the wildfires.  ""How stupid am I??!!"" I thought to myself.

I've quit a few times before.  Once for a year, and the other time for about a month.  Other attempts have ended up with me smoking after just a few days.  The good news is since I met my wife four years ago she's been on my case about smoking and for the last two years I've smoked about 2-3 cigarettes a day only.  I feel like my addiction is probably less physical at this point, and more mental.  That being said before these last few years of a few smokes a day, I was a half a pack-full pack a day smoker for 14 years.  

I just read an old post of someone on here who got diagnosed at 34 of COPD.  I am starting to freak out thinking that maybe that's why I am having breathing problems.  I'm scared of going to the doctor to find out.  I just want to quit.  I need to quit.  For my daughter, myself, and my family.  

I have nicotine gum which has worked in the past.  It isn't a silver bullet, but it takes the edge off.  

I feel like an idiot for smoking all of these years.  I have been able to quit hard drugs and even booze but these stupid cigarettes are going to be the end of me if I don't quit.

6 years ago, I was 140 lbs at 6'2"".  I was depressed and angry at myself and the world.  I had problems sleeping and eating, and was convinced that my life would never be good.  I smoked over a pack a day, and was always high.  That was the lowest point in my life.

I was faced with my own mortality in a very real way, and it scared me.  People often describe going cold turkey as feeling a switch flip, but for me quitting was more of a slow realization that my life had to change.  I decided to focus on what I could control, and quit smoking.

It was really hard.  Still is sometimes.  The first few weeks felt like I was taking it 5 minutes at a time.  Constantly reminding myself of my goal of not smoking.  I remember my mantra at the time was ""the only thing that matters is that I don't light a cigarette.""  I repeated that to myself 100 times a day.  Through all the rationalization and justification of ""just one wouldn't hurt"" that mantra kept me going straight.

At work when my breaks would come, when I would usually go outside and smoke, I would go outside and power walk my anger away.  I remember those first few weeks were dominated by anger.  A lot of succeeding in those times came from learning how to manage my anger without turning it in on myself.  I had tried to quit before but I always ended up feeling so angry or uncomfortable through the withdrawal that I relapsed.  This time though, I had coping mechanisms for my anger and I think that helped immensely.

I used nicotine lozenges in the first few months to help with those cravings.  Sometimes I used so many that I burnt sores into my cheeks.  Some people will tell you that you shouldn't use nicotine like that, but it helped me from lighting up. I was having to relearn how to live without a cigarette in my hands, and I think that really helped teach me how to drive without a cigarette, wake up without one, eat without one, ect.

In 2 months, I gained 30 pounds.  I regained my appetite and got back to a healthy weight, I felt good about myself for the first time in a long time.  Seeing that physical and mental change really help me keep going.  I wanted to see \*how\* good I could feel about myself so I kept at it.

Drinking alcohol and eating were, and sometimes still are, the hardest times to stay true.  For a while I had to avoid alcohol completely as I didn't trust myself to not smoke, but I'm happy to report that I can now drink without a craving.

In the 6 years that followed, I spent more time focusing on my career and have a great job now.  I found love and got married, and kids are coming soon.  I've been on hikes to the tops of mountains, visited other countries, been scuba diving, and so many other things I never thought would happen.

&#x200B;

If I could offer some words of encouragement or advice to those who are just starting out, or even those who are years in, it would be:

\- Develop a mantra, or a habit that you can focus on.  Cutting out smoking is harder than replacing it.  When you get a craving, go do that thing, or say that thing, and it will help.

\- Be prepared to deal with your negative emotions.  People react differently, but for me it was anger.  Coming up with a way to deal with that anger was really important.

\- Remind yourself frequently that life will be better without cigarettes.

\- Don't be afraid to avoid the things that make it harder. That includes people.  I had to spend some time away from my smoking friends, but I was able to spend time with them again once I had a handle on myself.

\- Give yourself grace.  If this is your first attempt, or your thousandth, remember to be kind to yourself.  That is what quitting is all about after all.

At the end of August I decided that I’d put it off too long, my asthma means I’m guaranteed COPD and that’s not something anybody should have to deal with. Plus my nephews are 1 year and 4 months, seeing them running about having fun I was suddenly hit with a feeling to be around as long as I could, it finally clicked for me. 

So I set myself a proper quit date, 30th of September, spoke to a nurse and got myself some patches, bought myself a vape (which, personally, I really don’t like). 3 days ago I started on the patches, with the aim of just reducing the amount of fags I had up until the 30th, at which point I’d stop smoking altogether. I smoked half as many that first day, yesterday I had 2, and after the last I just put everything away. So today is officially day 1, 18 days early but 17 years late. As I said I don’t like vapes myself, they taste horrible and make my throat tight, so it’s perfect. Every time my cravings flair up I have a couple pulls, I get the nicotine but I don’t enjoy it like I do with a cigarette. The 30th is now the day I’d like to stop using that, at the latest.

I am 59 fucking years old!  When am I going to feel I'm ready already?  I work in a real hard thinking field...and i overthink EVERYTHING!  I have quit so many times I have lost count.  Even for a year.  Pain always seems to be the precipitant that gets me back to smoking.  Now I don't have pain.  So I have no excuse.  My sister recently died of lung cancer after a 2 mo. diagnosis.  She and I have the same illnesses, all the time!   My mother died of it too.  I keep telling myself I need something to replace the cigs.  Something to replace the pain.  Something.....maybe yoga, or meditation, or a walk, or a progressive muscle relaxation, something to do every. time. I. get. a craving.   I can always quit....but I can't STAY quit.   So maybe if I get into some of these habits BEFORE I quit, then I will have a better chance this time?   I just don't think I'm quite ready.  I don't think I'm mentally healthy enough yet.

As long as you prepare mentally for the cravings, the situations ahead you indeed will be a non smoker. Cannot day for life. Since 4 months is still to earlier. But that is deeply my wish. Never give another puff. Yes there is times that question myself why not one puff instead of cigarettes the classic ones. The ones now that do not do combustion. With a machine. Or e-cigarettes since live with someone that use that. But know very well that in this 4 months did not lose a arm just because stop smoking. Did not solve any problem if smoke a cigarette. The problem would be there. So, at least i found not just extra time, but also save money and my Heath that in a pandemic moment is a bonus. 
So yes you can do it. Sometimes you will struggle but is so momentary that you just accept and move on like nothing happen. And every day extra is a win for you and your future. In 4 months could buy a new AirPods Pro and still save extra 500€. That AirPods Pro are an extra remember in my case that I could afford them easily because of stop smoking. Maybe next time buy the Apple Watch but knowing that things I can buy and use for my benefit instead of burning cigarettes that destroy my cells with that money is a massive bonus since. That means after pandemic, a well deserved hollidays probably al paid next year my not smoking. That is something amazing to look forward.

Good luck everyone.

That stick is in my hand constantly and the idea of stopping seems impossible right now because i don’t want to stop. I’m using 3% of the Virginia tobacco flavor now and I’m hoping that I can step down to the lowest % and maybe switch to a different flavor that I don’t like so much as a way to ween off. I feel embarrassed that I’m still using the Juul and it’s obvious to everyone around me that I have a problem. Lately I’ve been wondering, is anyone else here dealing with a juul addiction? Seeing photos of Sophie Turner with her juul in hand in every shot made me realize just how bad it can be for anyone. My sister in law quit using hers a year ago and said she cried for days and tore her house apart looking for any old pod that still had a puff left in it.

1. Start by cutting down if you’ve failed cold turkey before. Do 10, 9, 8 etc and drop one cigarette each day. At 1, tell yourself it’s the last and final one. Be content with this thought and understand that your life may depend on you stopping and that each day of smoking ravages your body. 

2. Give yourself treats. I had a system where I would make a wish list for things to buy with the money I had saved from quitting. At first it was stupid stuff, like a new iPhone case or something. But after six months I had saved enough money for a vacation. Yes, this is how much smoking costs. 

3. Understand that there’s no easy way. Almost three years down the line and I’m once a month still craving a cigarette. Don’t let this intimidate you though. Ask yourself, do I wish to cut my life short and risk a painful death, or am I stronger than the nicotine? Am I not a person with a will? Can I not defy an addiction? If you tell yourself you can’t, you’re letting the nicotine win. Don’t let it. Be resilient and try harder. 



I’ve known smokers who have died after 15-20 years of heavy smoking. There is no scenario where you’re going to be 75+ and healthy while still smoking. Don’t buy into the bullshit stories that the tobacco companies invented in the 1960s and 70s, there’s no such thing.

I’ve had the idea of quitting now for a while but it’s been pretty hard and i just didn’t feel ready to be able to do it (depression anxiety etc). 

Recently i decided i was gonna finally go ahead and give it a try. I read about Cytisine (the international brand names are Tabex / Desmoxan i think) and bought myself a 100 capsules pack, with the treatment lasting 25 days. 

Before i started, i used to smoke 1 pack (and sometimes a little extra) daily. The prescription says that you should stop smoking completely after 5 days. 

In the first 4 days i smoked between 6-10 cigs every day (which i still consider somewhat of a win since i reduced them by more than half). This is the 5th day, I’ve had a few puffs with my coffee and that’s about it so far. I do get cravings but try to ignore them / have a snack or a gum / do something else. 

I’m not completely sure i’ll be able to stop completely even after this 5th day, but i definitely want to do that soon. For now i’m just thinking to have a few puffs with my morning coffee for another like 3-4 days and then stop completely. 

I’ve noticed that my throat is pretty sore and I’m coughing recently. Is this a side effect from quitting? Or perhaps from using Tabex and also having a few puffs (the prescription says that smoking after 5 days can aggravate the withdrawal symptoms). 

All in all i am pretty determined to quit once and for all, as it’s been quite a few years, and really wanna get rid of this unhealthy habit. 

Any tips from others that have gone this route are highly appreciated. I stumboled upon this sub recently and it’s amazing. You people are awesome and so supportive.

I have cut back dramatically on smoking these past two weeks. I went from going through half-a pack day at most, to now taking several days to get through a pack. I have not had a cigarette in three days, and I want to know... is it normal for your stomach to cramp up, and to feel nauseous? 

The past couple days I have been feeling very nauseous, almost anxious in a way. Anytime I eat, my stomach bloats SEVERELY (even at night) and it actually begins to affect my breathing. The constant tummy-rumbles and accompanying anxiety are making me think its something severe or serious, and I just want to know if this could be a direct result of the smoking. It's not \*horrible\*, but its annoying and I have skipped a couple of my zoom class sessions because of it.

Any info would help. I need to quit smoking now, as even though I am in my mid-20's, I am just starting to feel the truly negative long-term effects of it, and it needs to end NOW.

2020-09-08 05:30:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/ioqk1p/its_been_2_months/,It's been 2 months,"Hello fellow hustlers,

As the title says, it's been 2 months for me (more or less), and I wanted to share this quick ""motivational"" story with you guys, for anyone struggling out there, you can do it, too. 

Since I've quit smoking, I've been repositioned at my work, they put me in a new office in another town, which also meant moving into a new apartment for me. I've had about a million issues with my new apartment (plumbing, loose floorboards, leaky windows, etc). Besides that, somebody hit my car 2 days after I came to town, so I had to pay a car painter to do the work. After that, my car's gearbox started to make some funny noises so I've had to take care of that at the mechanic's. Needless to say, both of those jobs cost quite some money. 

So I moved into a brand new office, I'm all alone here. I moved into my new apartment, and at least I wasn't alone there because my girlfriend moved in with me, but soon later she left me. She lived with me for about a month, but then she left me. It's been a month now that she left, and I'm still trying to get myself out of the depression rut. While she was living with me, I was taking care of us both financially because I could've afforded it, but I guess that wasn't enough for her. I was always trying to be my best version of myself for her, but it was never enough. She blamed me for all sorts of things, she made fun of me in front of my friends, she barely had sex with me, barely touched me, barely kissed me, she was lazy, etc,.. I don't know why I spent so much time with her, but at least I had someone in that new empty apartment...

Soon after she left me, my mother got into a accident, and I've had to drive back home (1hr approximately) and picked her up from the emergency room. I've spent a few days home, and just came back to my place recently. 

In that time, I also found out my best friend has been bad mouthing me behind my back for YEARS, and I haven't really dealt with that yet. It will be hard to deal with it anyway, because ever since he got a girlfriend he kind of closed himself and isolated from all his friends and he doesn't participate in any activities any more. He's also become very judgy lately and I don't feel okay talking to him on regular basis any more. 

So, to not make this story too long, what I'm trying to say is that I've been quite through some stressful events in the past 2 months. I fell into a depression soon after I  quit smoking (about 7 days later), and after that one thing after another started happening to me ... It beat me down more, and more, and more,... It got to the point where I barely stood up in the morning, some days I didn't, at all. I just spent my days laying in bed feeling sorry for myself...

BUT... I didn't light up. I've had moments (and I still do) where I felt so lonely and so alone that I barely saw any point, and the only thing that would make me feel okay would be a cigarette. But, as I said, I didn't light up, nor do I have any intentions to. 

Yesterday, after work, I decided to go for a hike. I mustered all my energy (what's left of it), and went to a hill/mountain that's close to my apartment. I've been there a few times before in the past, it's a well known hill/mountain in the area, but as far as I remember, it always took me A LOT of effort and energy for that certain hike. I always needed at least 1hr30mins to get on top of the hill/mountain, and when I did, I was always feeling fuzzy and foggy, and simply put - drained of energy. 

Well, yesterday was different. It took me 50 minutes, without a single pause, steady rhythm, steady speed, to get to the top. Once I reached the top, I was literally shocked! I never imagined I'd be able to hike up the mountain so fast and without even making one single pause! 

I just laid there on the grass for a while, thinking about how depressed I've been lately, how many things brought me down, how much for some reason I can't get over my ex, how lonely I've been feeling, etc,... But no matter what happened, I DID NOT LIGHT UP, and the results are finally showing! 

It took me 2 months of a serious emotional hell, but at least in these dark times, I've got one good thing to show for! I've finally found my reason to get up in the morning again. 

Quitting smoking is not easy, quitting smoking while life is throwing bricks at you, is hell.

But if I did it, you certainly can, too.

With my personal best advice at the end.,"First, I know quitting works differently for everyone. This isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach. 

Second, I know “joining a study” isn’t something we can all do. Again, this was just my experience so if any part of it helps, great!

Third, here is the type of smoker I was: Started at 18 y.o. in college. Told myself “I’ll never buy my own packs and only bum cigs” kinda annoying, I know, but I guess I was fooling myself into thinking I had control. In reality, I could go days without smoking but then smoke half a pack in one night at a bar. I only smoked when I drank, for most of my smoking life. It eventually got to the point where seeing others smoke triggered the nagging need to grab a cig, so I knew I had gone too far.

~2012 started smoking, whenever someone offered (in college that’s a lot). I was smoking between classes, at parties, etc. 

~ 2014 realized I only liked smoking when drinking. Stopped smoking sober. You’d think that’s a step in the right direction but it’s SO HARD to stop yourself from smoking when your self control is weakened from booze and you’re having a good time. 

~ 2016 noticed that cigarettes were actually distracting - like I couldn’t focus with a drink in my hand if I wasn’t also smoking a cig, especially if there were smokers around

2017 I joined a study at Uni of Pittsburgh that was gathering data on “non-daily smokers looking to quit entirely.” Since most studies currently focus on daily habitual smokers, the treatments to quit are also based on those types of habits. A smoker like myself is incredibly inconsistent. It’s hard to break a habit like that. This was the first step in truly attempting to quit, but I never did entirely during that study. 

2018 my smoking habits waned naturally because my social context changed dramatically and most people I hung out with were non smokers - I call that lucky. I could no longer bum cigs easily. The less I smoked, even while drinking, the less I liked them. 

2018-2019 I moved back into a heavily smoking scene. I decided to start making moves to ween myself off, because it seemed to be working. My new year’s resolution was to “only bum a drag here and there and no longer have my own cigs.” As if I couldn’t be more of a cig bum, but a lot of my friends were fine with it and knew why I was doing that. 

April 2019 I actually started dating a guy who was super grossed out by cigs. At that point I was far enough weened off that when I learned he didn’t like them, I was able to quit entirely. The guy wound up being a huge jerk and kind of broke my heart, so I figured “if I was gonna get anything out of this sham relationship it’s that I haven’t smoked a single puff in 5 months.” I haven’t smoked since. 

Kind a ridiculous way to quit, now that I’m typing it out. The BEST advice I got was *you have to identify as a person who, at some point soon, will not be a smoker*. Seriously I can’t stress this enough. People identify as “cat people” and “music nerds” and “car enthusiasts” and whatever else. Start identifying as a non-smoker or someone who will, soon, no longer smoke. This works better than identifying as “someone trying to quit” because you’ll always be just that.

I still crave from time to time but after a certain point you make so much progress you don’t want to ruin your streak. Also, now I just say “oh I’m not a smoker, thanks though.” It also helps that recently I accidentally smoked tobacco (thought a splif was a joint) and HATED it. Was relieved that it didn’t satisfy anything for me.

It started as a thing to look cool and it soon became an addiction. I would show up to my classes reeking of cigarettes and bad cologne. My girlfriend and I have been dating for over 4 years and really help me quit. I wanted to for months leading up to it and would quit for a week or two and get back on it. I recently had my last cigarette last December on my birthday. My friends have been pretty supportive but I convinced to let me have one last cigarette for my 19. I have smoked cigars on and off throughout the last couple months and just been really stressed. I really have urges to get back on it the only thing stopping is the same I would feel telling my girlfriend or my family. I really don’t care about the health hazards I know that sounds ignorant but it really feels like I can just quit later. I’m still young I feel. I’m not sure what I’m expecting out of posting this but I just had to get it off my chest.

2020-09-06 20:21:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/inxask/unexpected_benefit_of_quitting/,Unexpected Benefit of Quitting,"Hello everyone! 

Let me introduce myself: I am marypoza, I smoked for 7 years, fortunately, I quit ""early"". However, after quitting in 2017, from smoking a pack a day, I continued to allow myself to smoke occasionally. Usually, I stopped for months, but after a party night, I could have a relapse that would stay for weeks. So I decided to kick the addiction for good recently. 

I believe young smokers, like me, do not relate to the harms of long-term effects because they seem like future problems and we believe we will quit before that. I found that even occasional smoking is harmful and many former smokers only realize this when they wake up one day, and they just feel good, healthy, and motivated for no apparent reason. The reason is that tobacco has many ""minor"" health impacts that are not widely known just as serious diseases. And it is unfortunate because many people would be motivated to quit if they were aware of how their lives can be so much better. 

I wrote about my experience and a list of 10 unexpected benefits from quitting I found, supported by scientific evidence I research, here - [https://medium.com/@marianamv112/stop-smoking-now-10-unexpected-benefits-of-quitting-c59745e163dd](https://medium.com/@marianamv112/stop-smoking-now-10-unexpected-benefits-of-quitting-c59745e163dd).

if you are a smoker and want to stop, just stop and tell yourself that from this moment on you are a non smoker. Each time you want to take a cigarette, ask yourself this question : **Am i a smoker or Am I a non smoker ?** if you see yourself as a non smoker it will be very easy to move away from this cigarette.

Sorry if this has been asked before- I'm new here so haven't had a chance to read everything. 

I'm about to quit (quit date 09/09) and I've been recommended to use NRT as I'm quite a heavy smoker. I've had experiences with patches before (long haul flights etc.) and I've found them to be good for reducing withdrawal symptoms for me. I've been recommended to combine them with another form of NRT, which I will do. 

As you'll all know, there's a 3 step system for patches. So, for people who've used them, here's my question; what do you do when you've finished step 3? Like, just stop using nicotine entirely? Continue with the other form of NRT? 

Also, how did you guys manage the cravings when wearing them? Did you use NRT for all of them, or try to fight through where possible?

I wanted to remind everyone that it gets easier. I smoked, at minimum, a pack and a half a day for around 10 years. A pack a day for around 5  years before I jumped to more. I could smoke 3 packs when I would drink. I was a heavy smoker. I’m an enthusiastic person by nature. I give 100% in all things and smoking was no exception. 

The first 3 weeks for me were hell on earth. Mood swings, body aches, panic attacks, dizziness, unexplained rashes and physical ailments, tears of frustration. Every time I thought I was coming out of it, I’d get hit with a craving, crippling depression or extreme unexplained panic. When I did find some peace, it seemed short lived. 

I slept when things got bad. If you can’t sleep, take something that makes you tired. People lie when they say “it will pass”. When you’re a heavy smoker, cravings can last for hours. Non stop. Sleep saved me. 

Thinking about this now is quite emotional for me. To see myself in so much pain and suffering for so many years. Everything I did or didn’t do revolved around smoking whether I knew it or not. I was never really at peace because I was secretly always waiting for the next cigarette. I know you are in pain too and I don’t want that for you. There’s no need to suffer anymore. 

You absolutely can do this and I want you to know I care about you. I care because I know how horribly it sucks, how scary quitting is and how much shame there is to process before, during and after. I genuinely want you to be free. And you will be free. Even when it seems like you won’t, I promise you will. You don’t smoke. You don’t need it. It doesn’t fit in with who you are now. Because you are awesome and smoking is not awesome.

I quit smoking six months ago, which I have been really proud of, as it's the longest I've ever gone in my 11 years of smoking! It really has felt as though smoking is the thing of the past, but I feel as though this question represents my last major hurdle.

I suffer from quite low self-esteem and depression. Smoking used to always allow me to numb myself to that eternal chatter of self-doubt. Clearly, numbing my emotions is not inherently positive but it does have its benefits in allowing me to get on with life, and the challenges that come up.

Lately, I have been trying to resume studies after taking a long break. I have been beginning readings for a dissertation, which will be a major challenge for me. Each time I try to read, the self-doubt and anxieties become so strong that I cannot focus on my reading, and am just unable to proceed. 

Yesterday, I gave into my cravings for the first time and got myself a cigarette. I hate to say it but it was actually what I needed to process some of the thoughts I've been stuck on, and when I got back to my book, I was much calmer. 

Now I know that this wasn't intrinsically the cigarette that brought about these properties. But I've been doing meditation (Headspace), and taking walks, but neither of these have worked so well as that one smoke.

I'm quite desperate now.

I've read about a dozen different ""How to quit smoking"" books. But I still don't get how to quit.

I really don't enjoy smoking. Like caffeine, my body reacts pretty hard to nicotine. I can feel like my body is fighting the dirt in my body. Sometimes i feel sick, get dizzy, feel tired and exhausted.
Still, I can't quit.

My longest attempt was 9 full days. These days were easy. On the 10th, I got pretty hard cravings. This was the only time, it was ""that easy"".

Now my attempts fail mostly within 24 hours.

Somehow it doesn't make ""click"" (that's how we say in Germany, when you finally understand something). In the moment I decide to quit, I am absolutely sure: this time I'll make it this time. A few hours later, it's gone and all I want is a smoke.

What's your secret? How did you make it ""this time""?

I'd appreciate any advice.

Thanks.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7913664}"

We are in the stage where we want to start trying for a baby within the next few months.

My husband knows he needs to quit. He told me a few days ago he would try. But every time I bring it up, he gets super mad, so it’s usually a conversation that’s off limits. It’s been that way since we first got together. With that being said, I don’t know how to get through to him about how important this is without causing a fight. I would love to be a support system to him as he goes through this, but that would require him being willing to talk to me about it.

I know I shouldn’t be so emotionally involved, but this is now affecting our plans to get pregnant soon. How can I go about this?  I don’t think he’s tried any strategies to quit in the past other than vaping or just sheer willpower (which has never worked). I thought about laying all of my feelings out for him in a text message or letter since he’s not comfortable talking about it in person. I want him to know how this is affecting me. I also thought about agreeing to purchase a new gun after he would reach a certain milestone as an incentive since that’s his big hobby, but I’m worried that will come across as bribery and make him feel like a child.

I kept meaning to quit and literally went to buy “one last pack” more times than I can count. I always figured it was easy to quit since I could take long breaks before, but I did not expect it to be so hard. I always thought I’d go a few days without smokes and I’d be fine but I just lived smoking at this point. I always joked to my friends during summer that it was “perfect smoking weather” because I HATED smoking in the winter. Can’t beat a smoke and a beer on the back patio in the summer. I’m currently 15 days smoke free and I never thought I’d even make it this far, even though it seems like such a small amount of time. 

I work an office job and it can be quite boring sometimes so smoking was always my “break” every so often. That habit was super hard to break but I now have almost no cravings. Maybe one every few days that disappears in a few minutes or so. 

But my sense of smell and taste has returned and I have SO much energy now. I work two jobs so I’m working about 14 hours a day and it’s all thanks to quitting. My second job involves driving around a lot and I LOVE driving at night. When people have a barbecue or a fire or I just smell the clean night air it’s so satisfying. I’m so happy I finally did it.

I didn't think I would make it a day let alone over 7 months, I'm not going to lie and say it was easy but it has been worth it.

In the last 2-3 months I have had more stress from work than I ever have before (explanation below if anyone is interested), not having the added stress of trying to figure out when/where I can smoke has helped to no end.

One of the things that has worked for me is not to think of the bigger picture but instead focus on each moment as it comes, so instead of thinking ""I've quit forever"" I just started out with ""can I make it a day without smoking"", then ""I've made it a day can I make it two"". Don't put yourself down if you are struggling, breaking habitual behaviour is one of the toughest things in life even without the chemical addiction involved.

Work stress context - I work in the UK education sector with data and analysis, from mid June to end of October are some of our busiest months in the best of years due to exams, results, year end returns and then enrolment for the new year.

Then they do a U-turn on the whole thing publicly without any guidance to centres on how we get the official grades or when we will get them, which or course means the already understandably upset students and parents are even more upset as we cant answer any of their questions as we only found out about the change when they did in the papers.

All this while having to rush through the installation, testing and release of several large systems in a matter of weeks instead of the original plan of a phased introduction over the coming year while having other teams dumping stuff in our lap because they are ""too busy"".

I wanted to quit since a while because I know it's bad for your lungs..etc. but I finally did mainly to stop my wife constantly complaining. I'm handling it much better than I thought I would (I smoked for 16 years) and cravings have been minimal and short.

But today I am angry with my wife. No no, not angry, furious. I feel like if I concentrate enough I can see the smoke coming out of my nostrils. But as always she would like to ""postpone"" my anger to tomorrow when the kid is sleeping also she is tired so she can't listen to me tonight. I know everyone would think ""if she is tired let her sleep man"". Trust me, this happens every single time and I have to ""postpone"" my anger to next week, tomorrow, after holidays, for the holidays...etc

Normally I deal with this by getting my pack of cigarettes and going for a walk for an hour to calm myself down, since there is not any other way as I can't actually get my anger out to anyone or anything.

What do I do now? I can't shout, everyone sleeping, also its not anyone else's fault. I can't punch something. I can't smoke even if I wanted to, I have none and shops are closed after 19:00 here (it's 20:00 now).

Any advice? I know I know, leave it. solve a sudoku, eat some snacks, brush your teeth, take a shower, play with something, keep busy with something else... Blablabla

I did not stop smoking to live up to their expectation. I stopped because I am no longer a smoker. 

As someone who is going back to college in the next two weeks, I did not want this to be about them but about me. I wanted this to be MY decision, my new identity.

So when the inevitable temptation comes in college, I am not standing there waiting for it but I can tell it, ""I do not smoke, not because I have to live up to my friends and family's expectation but because it is just NOT who I am.""

I started smoking because I felt like I couldn't really talk beyond superficially with anyone in college until I started hanging out with some rough kids who used to gather around at weekends and drink or smoke weed and talk; I didn't plan to consume alcohol or marijuana so I picked up the habit of smoking. It started in moderation then dangerously became 20 cigarettes a day, as is the case.

I guess the fact that it started as a means of social interaction has to do with this, but now that I have quit for three weeks I realize that I smoke to curb loneliness. I am (I suppose?) introverted and even though I can talk to people fine, I would rather lock myself up in a room, listen to music or read something (and, of course, smoke my lungs out) - conversations are anxiety inducing mostly. But on the other hand I also do feel extremely lonely at times, and it is precisely at those time I would automatically put a cigarette in my mouth. 

I quit cold turkey because three weeks ago I got a terrible throat infection. I don't plan to get oropharyngeal cancer anytime soon, but I constantly thought throughout these weeks that if I do I would most likely commit suicide than get treated. But I also feel extremely lonely and empty at times; I didn't have any physical problem quitting, but I keep questioning myself why I really would want to quit.

&#x200B;

I'm a 30 year old guy who's been smoking on and off since I 12.

I'm generally pretty active, go to the gym 5 days a week weight training and run twice a week, I can do 5km in under 25 minutes.

I hate the fact I smoke, I know all the problems it causes and if I could push a button I would stop for good. I've given up many times in my life, sometimes for over 2/3 years at a time 

The problem I have is that I actually don't find it very hard to stop, I don't get any huge cravings or experience any massive withdrawal pangs. I have read Alan Carr's Easyway to Stop Smoking more times that I can count but eventually, I always end up buying a pack and starting again. 

This week is a prime example. My sister had some smokes laying around so I decided to have one and felt fine, I didn't smoke the next day but couldn't resist buying a pack on my way home from work last night. 

I told myself I wouldn't smoke today, 

I woke up, went for a run and then the idea of lighting up came in my head. I wasn't having any physical cravings at all and there was this voice in my head I just couldn't resist so I lit up.

I honestly don't think I'd miss the nicotine portion, it's more the lozenge part. I've looked a lot of places and can't seem to really find anything that lasts as long.

There’s been times where I was close to a pack a day, and others where I barely smoked at all. I’ve also gone thru several failed quit attempts

So a couple weeks ago, my gf mentioned she wanted me to cut down on smoking. I decided to turn this into a quit. I immediately signed up for my company’s free quit smoking program and shortly after received some 21 mg nicotine patches in the mail. I probably didn’t “need” the 21mg patch because I was smoking between 7-9 cigarettes a day but I decided to do all 3 steps

Last week I ordered the 14 mg patches and they STILL haven’t shown up. On Sunday my dumbass smoked a cigarette with a coworker. I guess 2 weeks was enough to change some of my receptors because it was AWFUL. Besides the terrible taste, I was coughing and and one point thought I might puke

Monday I was off work and spent the day with my gf. Cigarette cravings weren’t an issue (not sure why) maybe because we were just running around all day. We had a nice lunch, dessert, light gambling, then pizza, Netflix, and beer at home. I drank 7 beers that night and did ok not smoking

Yesterday was back to work. Got thru the day without any issues. Although I did find cravings spring up from time to time. I found my self wishing they sold smaller packs of cigarettes (like 5 or 10) because I know buying a full pack will put me right back to square one. Luckily I’ve refrained successfully so far

Today is the day I’m worried about. I also drive for Uber/Lyft in my free time and doing that is different than my regular job. Uber isn’t as physically demanding as my regular job. I’m not moving around pushing boxes, carts, etc. And I’ll be surrounded by places to get cigarettes as I’m out doing my trips. I know traffic patterns, bad drivers, and if I’m unlucky enough (I usually am) the right passengers will get on my last nerves, and I’ll end up breaking down and getting a pack. I’ve been thru this on previous quit attempts

It actually makes me want to stay home all day in spite of needing the money badly. If I stay home with my gf all day, even if I do get a bad craving I can’t just run to the store and get cigarettes like I can if I’m on the road today. She helps keep me in check with stuff like that 

I guess I’m just scared of what could happen today and I don’t want to fail, even though technically I did on Sunday by smoking that 1 cigarette with a coworker. Any Uber drivers here struggling with quitting?",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.41498023}"

When I smoked and was cutting back I would throw the cigarettes into a large bush or wooded area. Then I would not be allowed to buy another packet of cigarettes, I *had* to find the ones I threw and use those. That was my only rule - no buying new ones until the full packet in the bush had been found and consumed. It was such a waste of money to not use them and *they were really nearby I just couldnt see them yet, whereas the shop was far away*.

I spent up to 45 minutes looking for them. When I found them I would have a few then throw them back in. Sometimes I would give up frustrated unable to find them, but plan to come back later.

After trying and failing to find a nearly full packet 5 times in 2 days I ended up going back less frequently. Eventually I got to 4-5 days without intending to - then it got easier from there. I am 2 weeks cold turkey and the cravings are far less severe than the same point when I quit before.

This was just a nice trick that worked for me. Instead of total rule on stopping, make a rule that makes it super inconvenient. 

Maybe you teach your brain that they aren't easy dopamine after all, since you have 45 minutes of frustrating inconvenience? Addiction comes from fast dopamine. Thats why crack is more addictive than cocaine - it enters bloodstream faster. I no longer had [cigarettes] but I had [45 minutes of searching plus 3 cigarettes] - the dopamine in the second option is super slow, but the dopamine was still there if I ""needed"" it so I couldn't cheat by buying a packet.

Basically, anytime I’m feeling really down or weak, I come here and it reminds me why I’m doing this in the first place, so thanks everyone! Unlike a lot of the more serious smokers here, I was an on-and-off smoker from my mid-teens to age 27 (current age). I was always able to abstain for long periods of time but would always come back because all of my friends smoked and my attempts to abstain were never really grounded in anything serious. Within the last year or two, however, and particularly during quarantine, things were getting out of hand. I was vaping on top of smoking a pack a day in some instances and I always felt like shit. The pH levels of my mouth were always out of wack which is a big issue for me because I have had lots of dental issues in the past. I felt cavities begin to form. I was also smoking large amounts of weed daily and would cough until I felt like I needed to vomit. Not cool. I have asthma and also probably have some underlying (and undiagnosed) mental health problems...

Finally decided to quit on August 13 and I already feel so much better! Like so many of you, almost every aspect of my life has improved (although obviously it’s been no walk in the park, either). Some of the biggest challenges for me have been things like appetite increase and near-constant mood swings. If I go a couple hours without eating something I suddenly feel like the world is about to collapse, which is quite inconvenient. And even though the mood swings have been tough, it’s the price I have to pay I guess for using nicotine and weed to manage and suppress certain emotions that are all now beginning to resurface. 

Godspeed to everyone here who is fighting multiple addictions at once, has underlying mental health issues (which is probably most of us here if we’re being honest, lol) or is just plain-old tired of abusing themselves. We all got this! Thanks for reading. Had a bad night of sleep and just wanted to get some things off my chest. Bless up!",21,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.47210392}"
