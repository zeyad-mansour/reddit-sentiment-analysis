1) Mindset - I say cigarettes do things for me that they don't actually do. I say they help me relax. There are a billion other things to do to relax. The reason why I chose smoking every single time and above them all isn't because smoking is actually good at helping me relax. I really chose it simply because I am addicted. (Easy Way helped me realize this)

2) physical addiction- it is a very weak subtle addiction that I am able to overcome at night when I go to bed. I think I can squish this physical addiction like a bug. Also, physical cravings will come. I will set a 5 minute timer and breathe through it. Acknowledge that it is there but say to myself that this is not what I'm going to do this time. 

3) Mental addiction is the bigger problem... However it relies and is built on the foundation of the weak physical addiction. I am now understanding that all the things I THINK cigarettes are doing for me are completely reliant on the weak physical addiction. So like with the physical cravings, I will Acknowledge my thought and then actively pursue thinking other thoughts.

4) I'm going to binge OITNB

5) I'm going to think about the things I'm gaining: energy, being able to breath, having a normal smell, and saving time. 

6) I'll update through out the next few days - even if I fail.

As a side note, I've never made it through a single day in last seven/eight years of smoking.

Update 1: 5 1/2 hours in - I am experiencing a craving. I'm thinking, ""Do I really want to quit? Do I really need to quit? Does it really matter that much?"" That's the ""big monster"" talking - though really - That's just the physical ""little monster"" speaking through the big monster... the weird thing is I wasn't sure if this was a craving or if it was just me thinking. I'm pretty sure this was actually a craving.

Update 2: 9 hours in. Seems just kind of annoying. Definitely having the thoughts/cravings of why bother not smoking...
 I should say why bother smoking in the first place then. Though I haven't smoked in nine hours, my throat still hurts. Can't wait till it doesn't hurt any more.

Update 3: 18 hours in. I am just realizing that I haven't experienced any cravings too noticeable on a physical level. It's all thoughts tempting me. The main one is, ""Do I really need to quit, will it make that big of difference."" I'm sitting outside right now - not having a morning cigarette.

it was/is great to have the time and freedom to deal with the withdrawl symptoms and not inflict my horribly aggressive quit temper on others 🤬👿🤬 to be able to hide away somewhat. 

withdrawl has been particularly nasty (44yr smoker), memory loss, anxiety, depression, mood swings, anger, headaches, fatigue, coughing so hard I sprained muscles in my back twice (ouchy!!) and generally feeling horrid and flat every single day for 4x weeks

but its getting better, getting easier ... I can kinda feel it. I'm not ""AS"" miserable now (lol)

I stopped smoking for 3 months and then started again recently: the first cigarette I smoked again was one I found untouched in the street on a bad day, bad week, shortly after the best and kindest man I ever met and dated (who supported me in quitting) told me he got a job on the other side of the world...that cigarette looked like a sign, a friend. Then, before I knew it, picking up cigarette buds became an option and I found myself looking for them when walking in the street, even remembering where I saw one and going back to pick it up later on. At one point I started leaving the house specifically to go find them and would walk and walk before I could find some with tobacco left in them. Several times I bought a pack, smoked a few and threw them away, and then would go back searching for them in the rubbish. Later, to avoid buying them or smoking them directly from the street, I started bringing rolling papers with me so I could use the tobacco left in the buds that I could find. The worst thing was the psychological impact this had on me. Then last sunday I said my last goodbye to this man; the day after I bought tobacco and have been smoking the whole week. Tonight, with the help and advice of a friend, I smoked several cigarettes in a row until I literally felt physically sick. I vomited and still feel horrible, nauseous, my face is pale. My friend did this when she stopped and she told me to remember every second of it, so that next time I think about smoking ""only one"", instead of having this fake memory of how good it felt I could recall these horrible sensations. I washed my hands and my teeth and the stench is still making me sick. No more illusions, this is poison.

I never formed the association between nicotine and caffeine others have, so it doesn't make me want to smoke.

I just wanted to share this book (available as audio also) as it helped me stop smoking and I honestly believe it will help someone else too.

I'm not a big reader, but my co worker suggested this to me saying she quit midway through the book and had no negative side effects. (I.e pains,weight gain, irritability etc.) So my skeptical self immediately called bullshit.. then thought what have I got to lose? Am I just scared of success? So I had been ""wanting"" to quit.. so I bought a month's supply of patches. Took a Saturday morning and listened to the whole book while doing chores. Afterwards I pulled the patch off, threw them all away and never looked back.

Anyone else feel the same way?,"I casually smoked for like 2 years... my senior year of college and the year after that. Usually it would be when I went out to drink but sometimes I'd buy a pack or two and smoke it until it's finished. At one point I decided I was going to quit smoking cigarettes so I bought a juul. Luckily I was able to significantly cut down on cigs since then... it's been 3 years since then and I can count on one hand the number of times I've smoked (usually when piss drunk). 

But unfortunately I feel like I've replaced one addiction with another. I feel like vaping is honestly WAY more addicting than smoking cigs. When I was smoking, having to actually go outside to smoke one and then brush my teeth to get the taste out of my mouth was definitely a barrier to doing it too often so I never really smoked more than 1 or 2 a day. However, with a vape handy I can basically hit it whenever I want. At my most addicted, I simply could not go to work or go out without my vape on me. I was hitting it basically all day. At the time I didn't think anything of it because I still liked the headrush and buzz it gave me. 

Since then I threw out my juul and have been smoking disposable vapes (puff, myle, stig). It hit me the other day that I don't even feel good when I hit the vape anymore... in fact I feel like total shit. Every time I hit the vape I get nauseous and have to sit/lay down. The nice headrushes/buzzes that I used to get are long gone and are just replaced by a feeling of intense nausea like I'm about to throw up. 

But I fucking keep going back for more even though it makes me feel like shit. I think this is a wakeup call for me to quit vaping for good. Anyone else feel the same way about vaping?",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9991617202758789}"

So, when I wake up in the morning, I cough like crazy. This morning I woke up and for once didn't immediately crave a cigg (have been breaking that habit by not allowing myself a cigg until I've been awake for at least 30min).

I got an hour into being awake without a cigarette, but the coughing was still there. It was a dry cough, I wasn't coughing anything up, but I could feel it in my lungs.

And for whatever reason, smoking tends to take away my cough (I don't know how it works, my body is weird) so I had a cigarette, but...

I don't want to ALWAYS have to have a cigg in the morning to get rid of the cough. Is this normal?? Do I just need to get over it and deal with my lungs feeling like shit for a few weeks??

Also - has anyone on here used Wellbutrin and Chantix together? Should I make a new post for that? 😅

I’m in my 30s, and I smoked about 10-15 per day for 12 years. I quit just over 5 months ago. I noticed improvements in my breathing in the first week, and obvious improvements in my ability to exercise. The gym is now an interesting personal challenge rather than a drag. 

I noticed coughing at around 2-3 months, which made a lot of sense. My lungs were clearing out the nasty. If you have been through this you know how weird and cathartic it is to be coughing up this gross cigarette stuff. It’s like, you can just tell what it is in your olfactory system. It’s not necessarily a flavor or a smell, per se, but it’s there. Anyway, I digress. 

The coughing went away after a few weeks and I thought I was done. 

I’m now just over 5 months quit, and the coughing is back and more intense. It feels good that my body is continuing to reject this stuff from my lungs, but I wasn’t expecting to start cig-coughing again. 

For those of you who have been here and have the t-shirt, any wisdom on how long it takes the lungs to clear this stuff out for good? Frankly I’m rather excited at the prospect that my lungs and my breathing are continuing to improve.

This post would seem really daunting for you at first sight because it is written by a non-smoker. I already posted a similar post on the subreddit 'Ask' and got few but nonetheless useful answers! That's the reason why I'm posting here, to tell you my story and get more feedback from smokers that try to quit their habit!

As I told you, I've never been a smoker. I'm 22 years old and I've had maybe 5 cigarettes in my life at most, often at parties. Last August, I met my girlfriend with whom I have an incredible relationship, which is so uplifting for me (and her); I have never felt so good with someone.

I should mention that she recently decided to quit smoking, since last October in fact (she had started 2 years ago). Her relationship with cigarettes was a bit like love and hate, she has suffered from depression during her teenage years and started to smoke to find some relief. It's also relevant to note that she almost never smokes in front of me. She's a bit ashamed of doing it and doesn't want me to smell it. However, she told me she was thinking about her cigs from time to time, like the habit to have one in the morning she enjoyed the most. Quitting was something that touched me a lot because she wanted to do it for a while and the fact that we are together had reinforced this desire to say no to smoking.

Except there is a problem: I have the impression that she has detached herself from the ball and chain of tobacco (she says it's behind her and thinks about it less and less) so that I'm now attached to it. I think about it often and weeks ago it was even constantly. I try to appropriate this thing that doesn't belong to me by going to try smoking myself (last week I stole a cigarette from a friend to see what it felt like...in the end I don't really like the smell alone even though I found relaxing effects), by informing myself about the subject and its consequences... In short, it has become a real obsession which is really weird.

I don't think I want to become a smoker but it's constantly catching up to me, and it's ruining our relationship bit by bit because she blames herself, that it's because of her that I'm thinking about it.... I acknowledged the fact she was a smoker and even if she would still smoke today, I would of course accept it. We discussed it a lot and I think it affects me so much for two reasons:

1. because she's my girlfriend and she's the first smoker ever that is so close to me. Some friends of mine and my cousins smoke as well but I've never been concerned with that issue, it's their choice and they should know the consequences. Here, maybe because I know it's really hard to quit cold turkey, I didn't want to see her keeping up with the bad habit. You will of course tell me it's her choice and I fully get it. But being my girlfriend, I was also reached by the tobacco issue and the negative consequences linked to it. Maybe I'm exaggerating but sometimes I saw tobacco like the habit that steals time from our relationship, something you can smell and see even if you're not a smoker, especially during summer with all the terraces opened.
2. because partially, as I said before, I've never really tried smoking and this 'forbidden' was tempting in a way, to experience it and see what it was. I know the trap behind it, that it is by trying that you eventually become addicted. In a way, I wanted to enjoy a smoke with other people, including my girlfriend; that underlines somehow a lack of self-confidence, that I need a cig to engage with people (which is wrong, I did 22 years without one!). But she's now joining me in the non-smokers club so I don't get why I'm going the other way. I talked to my mum who was a smoker before and who sees her quitting as one of her biggest victories in life. She told me there are many other and more healthy ways to enjoy life, that I couldn't do my sport anymore, that I will be attached to that daily subscription for a long time. She said that in the 80-90's, it was fun maybe but now with all the bans (and the future doesn't look bright) it's more a pleasure that is guilty and even bad today.

You see, even when writing this, I have compiled so many reasons to enjoy life as it is and not smoke. But I'm still thinking about it from time to time. How could I do to definitely get away from this subject that is simply not me and go back to the state before meeting my girlfriend when it was irrelevant for me? See, I'm 22 while most people pick up the habit between 16-18...maybe I'm right into this period of trying/doubting now ? Thank you!

PS: I think it's also important to zoom out and see the bigger picture. If I imagine being single again, then I don't see myself as doubtful as right now to become a smoker. So, why would I become one when my GF is slowly quitting?",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.5862574577331543}"

I feel amazing. My asthma improved exponentially, my smell improved, my skin, teeth, and hair improved. I am not spending $6 a day to choke myself. I am not walking around smelling like death. Im not embarrassed by having to take extra breaks or find places where smoking is acceptable. It's amazing.

 I smoked for 3 years (before that I was quit for 5 years after smoking for 2.5 years) and the last year I tried a million times to quit. All cold turkey. I cannot recommend the patch enough. I think you have to be truly ready for any quitting to stick. But i was so ready. 

I only used the patches for a month (I think theyre recommended for 10 weeks) then one day noticed I forgot to put a patch on and thought I had one on for the last 24hrs. Stopped using the patches and I have not once craved a cigarette this whole year. 

Quitting had a domino effect on my life. I wanted to improve my health in every aspect after quitting. I had a spiritual awakening of sorts, went to therapy and did some heavy trauma work, exercised more, took better care of my skin and hair, decluttered my house completely, and am working on my food addiction now that I've pushed deep down and not dealt with for years. 

By quitting cigarettes I let go of the part of me that had no respect for myself and my self esteem soared. Thanks to this sub, Allen Carr (didn't read the whole book tho), and the nic patch, I feel I am living a life more aligned with who I truly am.

Thanks to those who helped me through my first week. Background, quit smoking 3 yrs ago, quit NRT 2 weeks ago after getting hooked on the gum. 

I feel the addiction has left me totally and I went out last night without wanting to smoke at all at the pub. The first 72 hours were the hardest after quitting as I felt I needed a fix. Whilst those cravings are gone I sort of feel  washed out and kind of like I just want to sleep a lot more. I have nothing to be depressed about and life is actually great. But in some ways it's like the buzz and a lot of the drive has been taken away and now I'm  just having to motivate myself harder to do simple things and put in more effort to focus. 

My plan is to replace that fix with something else, probably exercise / get task focused on something new.

I don't feel sad about things, and I am getting pleasure from pleasurable things, but I just feel like I want to slump in a chair and let out a big sigh. I don't know, that's the  best way I can describe it. 

Are these feelings common at the stage of quitting that I am at?

Got my scan results. I have had a near complete response. That is, little to no active cancer and no new mets.

It only works well for about one in 3 women so I am fortunate.

I think quitting drinking and smoking helped. I also am very strict about relaxing, resting taking it easy and living life how I want to. 

Whilst I am glad the treatment is working I do occasionally wonder what it would be like if I quit smoking 6 years ago when I was first diagnosed. I dont beat myself up. I was in the grip of alcohol use disorder back then and of course the insanity of addiction.

There is one thing which i wanna share with you all, i don't know if you have experienced this or not. I used to smoke pot and drink with my friends. I am still in contact with same friends but now there is a slight change in their behavior and attitude towards me. They kind of hate that i had quit drugs, that i don't hang out at those places. First i motivated them to quit these things too but then when they got offended with this so i stopped asking them to quit. Since then their drinking habit has increased to a great extend. We are in our 25-30 age group. They don't like to hang out with me now. I have made new friends now who are like me and who dint drink or remain wasted. But my old friends are jealous of this also that why am i making new friends. I never imagined this behavior from them. The truth is i want them to accept me as same old friend with just a change that now i don't drink but it seems impossible. Smoking dint just made me loose money and time, it made me loose my old friends too which is my biggest loss.  
PS i am a male and friends are male too and we all are heterosexual. haha

I hope you’re happy and safe in these strange times.

I do not consider myself happy, for the past 4 years I’ve done nothing but drink, smoke and sit on my lazy butt.
I do not want to feel like this anymore, so I came to the realization that I need to fix my lifestyle.
That is why as of today I am quitting smoking for good and starting to exercise instead.

With the help of champix. In my case never took above 0.5mg since did not want to had a drug in substitution and was mentally prepare. Every day had loads of videos to watch why stop was the best decision. Some extra exercise and time preparing better food. In no time was fine. Stop the champix only 20 days after stop smoking as program on the program of champix, so stop too earlier. But was ready. Still a few withdrawals and craving. But the first 3 weeks are known to be the ones really difficult. And that’s it. After 6 weeks test myself around loads of friends smoking. And just the look of envy to me be able to stop was the last kick saying was my best decision ever. Since they are still trap. Not me. From that moment yes still a few more cravings. But after month 9 no more. Still every day use smoke free app to add another day smoke free. Now can grab a pack of cigarettes to friends. Can have at my front all day. I just don’t feel anything.

The product has to be tested for the emissions of harmful substances with usage: tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide. The tobacco and tobacco products law has been made for protecting the public health, there are maximum values in it. But in a filter cigarette there are little holes, because of which official official readings are not aligning with the actual values. The smoking machine does not cover the holes, because of which the values are artificially low. The smoker then covers these holes with their fingers and mouth, through which the true values you inhale are way above the allowed limit.""

i first started smoking at a coping mechanism, its the only way i can get alone time for 5 minutes to be on my own. to this day, it still is the only way i can have time fully alone. where i know 100% no one is going to come out and talk to me. 

not having cigarettes makes me feel so so anxious and ive got maybe 4 rolls left- im considering going out and buying a new pouch but i really need to quit, its not doing my health or my wallet any good. 

ive managed to go from 25g per week to 25g pack per 2 weeks. 

im conflicted as to if i should try to do 25g per 3 weeks and keep trying to extend that time until im comfortable with 1-2 smokes a day and going cold turkey.

I reached my apartment and hid it underneath my pillow so that my flatmates don't know about it. I smoked both of the cigarettes that night and slept with a heavenly feeling (You all must know about your first time!). The next morning I went back to work and started smoking with my colleagues telling them that I've also started smoking. At that time, my naive brain wanted to understand how Nicotine addiction works. Crazy right? At least, this is what I kept hearing from my friends and colleagues. Within a few months, I was near a pack a day and maybe more. I was earning good enough to not care about this as an expense. But still, at the back of my mind, I was sure that I can leave it whenever I want. Yep, that's how much of a fool I was!

There's another side to this story. Around 7 years back I started playing a game called DOTA2. On average one game of DOTA 2 lasts about 45 mins and in this game, you get killed by your enemies, and then you have a respawn timer of about a minute or so. In this one minute, you can take the hands off your mouse and do something else such as lighting a cigarette! In the last 2-3 years, I was smoking 3-4 sticks per game! Sometimes I used to feel bad about it looking at all the ash on my keyboard, on the desk, and what now. But till that time, it was so deep that I never even thought of quitting. I die - I smoke, I win - I smoke, I lose - I smoke!

When the lockdown started, every gaming enthusiast was moving towards streaming and I thought why not? Here the good kid in me thought of a plan to quit. If I am in front of a camera playing my game, I won't be able to smoke and hence I'll be forced to stop smoking while playing which may result in me quitting it for good. It worked for a few days and I was happy, to be honest! But the other part of me figured out a hack - I started switching off my camera feed while I was smoking. Fucking disgusting! You can literally hear me taking the drags in my videos.

Well, I feel I've blabbered too much. **The experiment has finally ended after 5 years. I recently stopped smoking and today marks the 42nd day and it gets easier day by day.** There have been so many days where I didn't even remember that I used to smoke.

I hope this little story of mine helps you quit. And yes, if you are interested in gaming, do drop by and say hi. It'd be awesome!

I’ve been smoking weed mixed with tobacco for about 10 years by now, daily since 7ish years. I started low, but now I hit about 4 spliffs a day. I don’t smoke cigarettes and I own two dry herb vaporizers.

I would like to make the move from spliffs to vaporizer only, since both the experience and the flavor, not to mention the health benefits, but I have been struggling to give up tobacco, and I tried quitting many times, usually going as far as 1 week, before going on spliffs again.

I don’t smoke on holiday and I don’t crave tobacco or weed at all when I’m away, and I usually smoke only when at home and alone, with nothing better to do.

I just bought the Alan Carr book since it has been recommended a lot, but my question is the following:

- on the long run, how bad will it get if I keep going this way? As I said I don’t want to quit weed, but it bothers me that I can’t give up the tobacco when I know that vaping is better. It feels like it misses an important component...but when I eventually vape, I always kick myself for not doing it more...I feel like I’m stuck in a loop!

I lost my phone a couple weeks ago and it should be arriving in the mail this week. Relevant only because that means I can't screenshot my Smoke Free app that says I've quit for one full year. But it has been a year, today, and holy smokes (or lack thereof), does it feel fantastic.

I smoked a pack a day for almost eleven years before I decided that enough was enough. I can't say there was anything in particular that caused me to quit, other than COVID quarantine forcing me to spend more time with myself than I ever thought possible, re-evaluating my priorities and life direction. 

I never thought I'd quit, so I just wanted to post this because if you're reading it, you can do it. You can surprise yourself with strength and stay committed to your quit, you just have to make the decision. When I really decided and I knew I didn't want to be a smoker anymore, I won't say it was easy (because it was the hardest thing I've ever done), but it made not going back that much easier.

Every day is now the longest I've been without nicotine in my Adult life.,"About 6 months ago, I stumbled [upon a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/ju4mua/41yo_suboxone_patient_with_lung_cancer_i_dont?sort=confidence) made by a man dying of lung cancer. This guy, at just 41 years of age, suddenly found out he had stage 4 lung cancer and less than a month to live. He expressed regret, reflected on his life, and didn't have anyone else but reddit to share it with.


I would encourage everyone here to read his post. 


I've quit a few times here and there. 24-48 hour stints mostly with a 5 week stint and even a 5 month stint under my belt. I had been telling myself that I *was* getting ready to quit and I just needed more time to prepare myself. ""I'm quitting next week or on this exact date or next month and just if I can get over this next hump, etc. then I'll be ready,"" I'd say to myself. This is the kind of self-talk I've been engaged in about smoking pretty much since I began over 10 years ago.



Then I read our friend's words, and in particular this struck a chord with me:



>A reminder of one of the several self destructive habits that brought me here. My smoking habit was not had enough to set things off this quickly, but it clearly did not help. For those of you who smoke, I have but one message: stop it. Please. *You think you will wait till you are ready. You will never be ready. You say you will quit tomorrow, but then tomorrow becomes today, and you are never ready today, only tomorrow. Tomorrow never comes. Today is the only day in which the decision can be made.* You can only quit TODAY. Do so now. Throw your cigarettes in the trash. Do it for me. What a gift it would be that my post would free you of tobacco's golden chains.



#**Today is the only day in which the decision can be made.**



That was me to a T. I'd been procrastinating and putting off quitting for so long that I had officially been preparing to quit for most of my smoking life. Eventually, I would have to face my addiction and it will be no different next week, month, year, than it is today except for that I'll have damaged my health and wellbeing even **more** in the interim. 



That night that I read his post I resolved to quit for good this time. I cut down significantly that evening, the next day I broke down and had a few and that was the last I've smoked or had nicotine since. 



I bought the nicotine lozenges and kept them by my side 24/7 for almost three months. I never used a single one. I never set out to go cold turkey, but the thought of resetting and being that much closer to a smelly miserable smoker again repelled me. The childproof top turned out to be a great fidget spinner, though, and that alone helped in the moment.


My tips:


1. Your mind plays tricks on you when you're in that first couple of months. Even before you quit. Just remember: You don't enjoy smoking. You don't enjoy the anxiety you feel when you can't have one. You don't enjoy having to constantly go outside when you're drinking with friends. You don't enj waking up in the morning and feeling like your lungs are dried up and about to crack.  You don't enjoy smelling like that, which btw holy crap you are going to be embarrassed when you realize just how much more you reek of cigs than you think you do.

2. Keep busy. 
3. If eating helps you get past the cravings. Just do it. I gained 10 pounds in that first month. But since then I've lost 40. 
4. For me, the thought of being that much closer every single day to having the health of someone who has quit for 10 years propelled me significantly. Resetting that clock in my head was too much to bear. 
5. Habit stacking. For some reason after breaking or building a habit, building other good habits suddenly become easier. I started lifting weight 6-7 days a week.


I very rarely get cravings now and strangely, most days I've forgotten that I ever was a smoker. Only when I see others light up do I remember.



We're all going to make it!

It was really bad and I remember standing in the bus stop one time for hours betting on the number combination of the buses. This and a constant mild depression.

Then it all stopped when I started college and got into smoking. 

Now I am doing the same stupid ""mental bets"" again after 25 years. I suspect that this has something to do with the change on my brain chemistry after I quit smoking.

Still, I can't help to feel a certain nostalgia for smoking. Right now I'm sitting beside a lake, sun is setting behind the horizon. I have a cold one in my hand. Surely this is the moment to have a cigarette.

Don't get me wrong. I absolutely don't want to smoke. It's just these moments when you feel like it's the moment to smoke if you know what I mean. Like this is when I would normally smoke. I don't really get the cravings anymore. Just the nostalgia.

Interesting development:

One thing that I think is amazing about going ‘CaliSober’ is that cannabis is a bronchial dilator where as nicotine is a constrictor.

The amount of tar I’m constantly coughing up is insane!! - But this is because my lungs are no longer constricting and trapping in the harmful chemicals where they can reek havoc.

I can’t believe that I’ve been constantly trapping all that crap in there.

This is just my story,
My solution,
It works for me.

Do you, but I hope my 2-cents might help you if your struggling. It’s all about getting this trapped crap out of our bodies. By-the-way quitting can do this is too, but then I suggest coupling it with running for the deep breathing to clear your lungs.

Pot is my shortcut. :)

I’ve noticed an underlying chatter happening internally the last few days: “will you smoke?” “No, I don’t smoke.” “You will smoke.” “I don’t want to.” “You don’t want to but, you ARE thinking about it. Maybe you DO want to.” “I don’t smoke” “......you do, you will smoke.” “I won’t. I chose not to.” “You’ve already decided you will, that’s why you’re always thinking about it.” Blah blah blah blah blah....... 🙄🤯 

It’s fear. It’s fear of failing and my insecurities and ego trying to preempt the failure by making it seem like my choice. If it WAS my choice and not an addiction... I wouldn’t choose to think of smoking would I, as I have stopped?!

I’m sharing this with you as it’s ok to have these thoughts. I hate them, they are annoying and consume my energy AND, I also accept them. If you have these thoughts and/or cravings, try not to push against them. I simply listen and move on, like flicking through channels on the telly. 

Anyone else have some insight to these instructive thoughts and/or rumination? Big hugs. 🤗 looking forward to a SmokeFree weekend. ♥️",6,{'lockdown': 1},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9634087681770325}"

My husband I have been together since we were pre-smokers but it was always our thing together after he turned 18 (I was a year younger hence starting at 17). I’m a solid 1.5 pack a day gal. 

We both quit in our 20’s for more than a year and ended up both sneaking it near the last few months and just starting it again together. 

Quit again three years ago. He stated quit and after 9 months I stupidly started again but he’s a fucking amazing champ and stayed quit this entire time, despite me smoking again. It’s been just around two years since I started again. 

Anyways I need to quit for my health (high blood pressure, etc) as well as it’s required for an upcoming surgery. Doing Chantix again and not looking forward to any of it but it needs to be done and I know I need to do it. I also feel having done it before I know why to expect and that there IS a light at the end of the tunnel. 

That being said my hubby, the most supportive mother fucker on the planet asked what he could do to help me and said “if it helps he would get Pom poms to cheer me on, and even wear a short skirt.” He was being silly. On a random aside I was like “if I quit I want to post a video of you to the stop smoking sub cheering me on with Pom poms and a short skirt.” He responded “if you quit I will do that, crop top and beer belly included.” If I don’t I have to do the same and I am NOT cheerleader hot and in no way want anything close to that on video or online. 

So the challenge is on!! 

Either way your gonna see a chubby person playacting a cheerleader but hopefully it’s my wonderfully supportive husband!!

In other words you become addicted to a substance, you’ll always be addicted to it, whether or not you’re using it. In fact, the addiction progresses even if you’re abstinent.


I recently started smoking again on a stressful day, and my addiction has come back with a vengeance. I successfully stayed away from cigarettes for a long time using a fair amount of nicotine gum, but bought a pack about a month ago, chain smoked half of it, and then threw it away and went back to the gum. It was pretty easy that time, and I tricked myself into doing again two weeks later. Then a week later. Now, I’m having a hard time going more than a few days at a time without smoking, and when I have a pack, it feels like I’m just passing the time until I can smoke my next cigarette (or 3).

I’ve gotten to this point with another substance, and quit because of how badly it was affecting me. But cigarettes are more insidious because they ruin your life slowly.

To be prefectly honest, I don't remember exactly **when** I started smoking cigarettes. I had a few here and there sporadically since I was 16, but I *believe* it was 2008. It would make sense, because I had just been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis and I was seeking **ANY** way of getting ""control"" back. I felt like I had lost so much, had so much taken away from me, I needed something to cling onto. In my desperate state, that thing ended up being cigarettes.

Here we are in 2021 and... Somethings gotta give. By the time night rolls around I feel like I can't breathe. I'm sick and tired of going to bed at night wondering ""will tonight be the night my lungs give out?"" (I try not to think like that but anxiety wins sometimes).

I was slightly over a pack a day, maybe 25-27? Started trying to cut back last week, I had been doing *fairly* well (~10/day) but I slipped up today and I'm definitely feeling it.

I wish I had picked something, ANYTHING else, but I can't go back 13 years and change reality, I created this hell for myself and I will create my resolution ❤️

That being said, this is **TOUGHHH**!

I had read somewhere about basically ""creating new habits for your triggers."" I haven't created new habits and honestly am not even sure what that means... Does anyone know/have any ideas?

It's smelly, embarrassing and I felt really bad whenever my family was close by to either smell it or see me smoking. Luckily, I was never a heavy smoker with usually three and up to six cigarettes per day at most.

I started when I was seventeen years old due to my ex-girlfriend, because it was 'cool'. I guess I was still pretty impressionable back then. (Hint: I guess, I still am. Little change on that front. Anyway...)

I recently turned 21 and when my last pack had finally been empty I just stopped buying a new one. This was two weeks ago and so far I'm holding up pretty good. The act of *not* buying a new pack that had been unachievable before doesn't feel that bad right now and I try to keep that mindset for the days to come.   
I occassionally get the urge to smoke, especially when I smell or see it or after I had a beer last weekend. Also, when I had previously tried to stop I would feel constantly cold. As of now I'm feeling *normal* actually.

Unfortunately, since I don't have a real reason to go outside anymore I avoid it alltogether. I guess I need to find something new to do in my free time.

To celebrate, I want to share 10 changes I noticed since that I didn't expect or thought I'd enjoy so much. I hope it'll give a newbie something to look forward to. 

1. My hair smells amazing. Fragrances stay especially long in your hair, and now I smell like flowers rather than a forest fire! 

2. I used to get small boils on my inner thigh. They hurt while walking, I thought I had a skin condition. Turns out they were caused by smoking, since I quit they're completely gone.

3. Better sleep. I feel rested in the morning! 

4. I actually lost weight. This took some adjustments, but my tastebuds recovered so well that I enjoyed healthy food again, I lost 20lbs and kept them off since. 

5. Improved mood! I didn't realise it, but smoking made me impatient. Even my friends pointed out I seem much more relaxed now. Maybe because that little voice nagging me for nicotine stopped bothering me. 

6. I knew my skin would improve but I had no clue it would be so noticeable! People who haven't seen me in a while all say stuff like ""what did you do, you're *glowing*!""

7. Tooth health! My gums bled at the slightest provocation, there always seemed to be something wrong at every dentist's visit. Since I quit I've had no new issues 

8. My cat likes me better now. He likes to sit on my lap, but as soon as I'd grab my tobacco he'd run off. Now we can cuddle uninterrupted. 

9. No more sticky sweat. I mean I still sweat obviously. Pretty sure I'd die of heatstroke otherwise. But the years leading up to my quit it got excessive and uncomfortable. I didn't even know it could be related to smoking.

10. I feel strong, because I did a difficult thing. I'm still doing it. When I fail at something, I remember that I failed at fighting my addiction before, but I still managed to be successful later. It gives me confidence.


You may have some of these issues, and they may persist after smoking. There's no guarantee that smoking will solve your health issues. I have a hereditary thing that I hoped would improve but didn't, and I had to accept that nothing I do might improve it. But there are *many* things to look forward to, and these are some of my personal ones.

 I'm checking in because over the last 5-6 weeks searching through reddit posts has been one of the ways I have coped with what has been the worst psychological withdrawal symptoms I have ever experienced. In the last 6 months or so I wasn't smoking many cigarettes day-to-day but I had begun a habit of using rogue nicotine pouches. I rationalized using them by saying that nicotine is not really the problem, tobacco is. Well, over time I increased the strength from 3 to 6 mg pouches and began doubling up a lip. I didn't use every day necessarily, but it got to a point where I was experiencing pretty heavy brain fog, which I knew was from the nicotine, as it was something I had experienced before when trying to quit smoking. I had a crippling panic attack one night, which actually set-in just before smoking a cigarette and with the first couple puffs. It was a pretty rough night and the next day I was pretty shell-shocked. A few days later I quit all nicotine cold turkey, and for the next 2 weeks I had incredibly high stress and anxiety levels, to the point where I felt a buzz, almost like being drunk or high, and had a couple smaller panic attacks, including one driving to work, which was fun. 

Today marks 2 weeks since that daily buzz of stress and anxiety started to subside. Basically my whole nervous system had been thrown into a deep freeze after the initial attack, and my sense of taste, smell, and my appetite all diminished, as well as the associated signals such as hunger pains. My mood went downhill, and I'm still dealing with general lack of motivation and down mood that is known to accompany the depressive cycle of cessation from nicotine. But it feels like the systems are coming back online. I have had fewer tough days recently, and it feels like my body is slowly returning to normal. I never thought of missing the feeling of soreness after a workout or the excitement and buzz of watching a basketball game, but getting a bit of it here and there recently has been a welcome change. 

I wanted to share this for a couple of reasons. I know that some people have probably experienced something similar to this, some have had much worse physiological symptoms but not psychological, and some are into day 10 right now wondering why everyone thinks it's so hard to quit nicotine products. My point is just to share my experience so that if someone else comes across this they can know they aren't the only one. I have not sought counseling or tried to explain all this to my family members because it felt like it would be too hard to communicate in such a way that they understood what was going on without worrying too much about me. There is also the practicality of it. I have already way overdone it compared to a normal reddit post's length, and I have only given the basic outline. Imagine explaining the hours of research into dopamine, brain chemistry, withdrawal timelines, coping mechanisms, etc. etc. It's a lot and I am still coming to an understanding of everything as I move through it. 

To those thinking of quitting, if this scared you don't be discouraged as your journey probably won't be as hard (I 'quit' several times before and it wasn't). For those who are going through hell, or who think that is what's coming, you can definitely do it and things get better. It seems more prolonged and severe in the moment, but once the storm begins to clear things come back into focus and calm.",13,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9988767504692078}"

I was one of those kids that always swore I'd never smoke, I didn't understand why people smoked. After a long childhood of trauma, when I moved away I tried a cigarette. Just one, and the buzz was amazing. I picked up smoking a little bit but would always feel very sick afterwards so I stopped for a while.

I picked it up again after getting of a psychiatric unit, it felt so good after that. I slowly got over the nausea and whatnot. I told myself I'd only do it for a while. Nowadays, I want to stop. I have major health anxiety and smoking doesn't help, but if I go without I miss the routine. My partner and I are both smokers and aren't able to get out much due to covid and also due to neither of us being able to drive. So when we go out to smoke, taking our dogs out (they never inhale any or are super near, they go out in a pen) or just sitting on the steps of our complex, it's such a nice feeling. I can deal with the withdrawal symptoms, as they're pretty mild for me, just some slight headaches and craving the buzz I know I'll get after a few days of not smoking. But the *routine* is what keeps me hooked. After a few days of not smoking I feel like I'm going crazy, and I don't just want to go sit outside and do nothing. I don't know what else to do to replace that routine, though.

Not only that, but I didn't realize how much media contained smoking in it until I started - and moreso, until I started thinking about stopping. Every show I watch, every other picture on the Internet. Hell, every other book I read. That instantly makes me want a smoke. You also never realize how much cigarette litter there is until you start smoking, and that's also hard for me. It makes me want just one, just one - and then it turns into more, you know the drill. I only smoke about 5 a day.

I don't really know what to do to help the routine issue, and I'd love some advice. Also, what thought processes do you use when you see cigarettes in media or even on the side of the road? How do you get yourself out of the ""It's only just one"" or ""I've not been smoking for that long, I won't be at risk for anything major for a good few years, so I can keep going for a while"" mindset?

I've tried vaping, but it isn't the same. I also really enjoy the scratchy feeling of the smoke going into my lungs, and nothing really replicates it.",3,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.5070492029190063}"

It’s really hard and I didn’t think I’d ever be able to do it but the people who were there close to me when I was at my lowest have really helped me get through this. 

It’s amazing the changes your body goes through in the first week. I feel like a new person (bit cliche, I know). 

I guess the point I’m trying to make is that you don’t have to do it alone. Find you bubble, let them help and if you can trade it off against something for motivation like I did, it can really help too.

I (25F) have quit smoking since a little more than two months ago. It has really stuck this time, mostly because I was just really sick of it. Before I quit I had been smoking for nearly 10 years. I am still doing great and have been boasting to my family about it. I'm so happy I'm finally actually done and I'm pretty sure I will not go back. 

I am pretty close with my little brother (19M). We've had a shitty upbringing and strict, religious parents. To me that was a big part of why I started smoking in the first place. 

I've always been the one watching over my little brother. Yesterday he tells me that in the last few months he's had his first few cigarettes. It was *only* with his girlfriend, it was *only* when other people went out to smoke and he got offered one, it was *only* one each time, etc...

Idk, I'm honestly just really worried he's going to get himself addicted before it's too late. I had a good talk with him, I was just honest with him, warned him. I made him promise me that he would at least be honest to himself that he's being really stupid right now (which is okay, a whole lot of people do a whole lot of stupid things), just to help him refrain from getting in the habit of making excuses as to why it's okay to smoke.

2021-05-20 07:59:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/ngyay3/smoking_as_my_identity/,Smoking as my identity,"I quit like 15 stupid days ago. I  do feel benefits. I don’t want to smoke to be a solution to anything or not feel my feelings I just want to do it, I guess, it’s me kind of. It is sort of “who I am” in a weird disgusting way honestly. I am known as “tough” and I like smoking Marlboro Reds which I have since 1989. I like when people see the box I like ordering them at the gas station. I like having one an hour into driving, then when I feel like it again. Honestly, I gave up a ton when I got sober a year ago, I just don’t really know my identity to be honest. I was fucked up for 35 years, and I’m 45 years old I think. I’m off all the drugs and alcohol, my brain is still 15 years old, in a 45 year old body. Coming out of isolation in the only sober year I have had this “new normal” is unknown to me. I don’t know who I am. I just know who I was. And that was the skater chick smoking Marlboro Reds and Camel Unfiltered.

Until tonight I didn’t realize my “reasons I quit smoking” were surface. To feel better, to smell better, stupid  bullshit. When are cravings most difficult? they ask.  
Cravings are most difficult when I make a big decision, when I am happiest, when I am saddest, when I am lonliest, when I am together with the few people in my world who mean everything to me. I have very little left through honestly my life and the one thing, the ONE thing I always had with me, was a cigarette. When I got in trouble, when I stayed out of trouble, when my dog died, when my baby was born, when I got the job, when I hated the job, when I lost the job..... cigarettes were there if not for me, they were with me, when I had nothing, and when I had everything, they wouldn’t leave no matter what.

Someone smarter than me boiled this romantic notion of my cigarette friend down to a inanimate coping mechanism with no feelings for me and my hardship. In fact, that coping mechanism didn’t stand by me, in fact, it had a secret motive, to kill me one day. If it had a brain it was planning, evil planning about how it would take me away from my family, how it would slowly kill me in the vise of loving me. 

I am taking my power back from this wolf in sheep’s clothing. I am taking my power back. I ask my Higher Power to please help me take my fucking power back. Please, please, I need to be strong and convince myself I am worth it. Let me be free from this torture. I ask, through tears, help me take my power back from this brutal disguised lovely sheep, in hairless drooling disgusting relentless hyaena who is ready to gnaw my flesh at any moment, clothing.",27,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9965170621871948}"

Anybody ever tried or want to do an accountabilibuddy type thing?,"I'm a 39 year old male.  Started smoking when I was 12.  For about 20 years i smoked about 2 packs a day.  Quit smoking for vaping and felt 95% better physically.  Tapered off to 0% nic juice and quit nicotine altogether for 6 months then my father passed away and that was a massive stress trigger and I started up on cigs again.  In the 2 years since i've gone often months without cigarettes and been good with a low nic vape, then i taper off to a certain point and I start fiending and buy a pack and that's where i hit the road block.  The main wall I hit is that I'm an artist and It's nearly impossible to work when i'm fiending for nicotine and I always cave for the sake of getting my work done. I'm not a heavy nicotine user and I feel like I could quit if I just had some accountability, somebody to support me going through the same thing.  


I always had trouble putting weight on, what finally got me religiously hitting the gym, lifting, packing on pounds was another person who wanted to get into shape and we did it together.  I hate the gym, I hate lifting but it was infinitely easier to have somebody in the same boat who could tell me to get my scrawny ass to the gym, share my weight increases with etc.  It's just something that worked for me, worked for them and maybe it could work for somebody else ready to free themselves of this curse.

Not chat all day, no big time sink.  Just somebody to endure this with and keep each other in check.

check out their reviews on google and apple store = madness!!

much much much love to these peeps!!! ❤️❤️❤️  have saved my life quite literally 

first time ever that ... ""I know"" 🤟👊✌👍
 
I know I will NOT relapse, I can't!

my life was totally destroyed first 3 days of quit and I didn't fail. 

Doesn't matter how bad my physical withdrawal is ... and my body is trying so hard to get me to smoke again, pulling put all the stops. depression, fatigue,  memory loss, anger, agitation, flash temper, physical pain, coughing, its absolutely horrible and unrelenting, cannot express how bad I feel still after 20x days no cigs (but this too shall pass) ... 

...its so weird, so absolutely fantastic but QuitSure has made me ""sure""

it HAS deprogrammed the nico lies

what is working for me ⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️

Exercise works:
- walking literally walks off cravings, stress and any anxiety associated w the quit.

- use Fitify and crack out a 10min workout of your choice for free

people always say you wack on weight when you quit but those dudes have never heard of exercise and sub food for cigs so no wonder.

have lost 3.5kg easy in 20 days walking and doing simple bodyweight exercises

Breathing exercises work:
- help me relax, centre and calm. takes focus off desire/craving to smoke

Drinking water / eating healthier works:
- makes me feel healthier, reminds me I am trying to get healthier not just quit cigs, replenishes cells, removes toxins, speeds healing

Mindfulness / Gratitude / Meditation works:
- helps immensely w the sadness, agitation, depression and overall horrible experience of quitting and detoxing

download Atom (android)
sweetest lil free app to increase your happiness via gratitude and mindfulness 

download One Deep Breath or Prana Breath ... do some box breathing 4.4.4.4 or 5.5.5.5 when you're stressing or a bit fixated and feeling weak.

Journaling works:
awesome record or this most awesome part of your life journey. takes mind off cravings / stress and provides outlet for expression of same

start a gratitude diary
one entry, once a day ""I am grateful for ...""
scientifically proven to increase overall happiness between 7 - 12% (that figure is crazy high if you think about it!)

start a daily journal
one entry, once a day

get your shit out in the journal, write how bad you feel, keep a record of your wondrous healing journey, be PROUD.

I've hardly been able to smile since I quit ... but internally I AM SOOO proud.

the frown is momentary trickery, as is the physical pain... it will relent eventually and I WILL be truly free of this affliction forever.


p.s. SmokeFree is absolutely amazing and has helped educate and keep me motivated and occupied throughout my quit. Without assistance and support like that, ongoing, after the fact ... it would be sooooo much more difficult to quit and *stay quit*... making relapse much more of a possibility. 

Other beautiful Quit apps I own and use are (all excellent and v helpful in my quit)
Flamy
Quitify Pro
QuitNow Pro

all good hearts, not scammers selling NRT n keeping you hooked via subscriptions garbage.


oh ... other things that have made me KNOW I will never relapse were the exercises in the Flamy app

their 14x day escape is wicked, couple of the exercises were life changing for me, stuff I was ignoring about impact of smoking on others lives

I used to be a pretty heavy smoker myself from 18 y.o.-25 y.o. I was smoke-free from Oct 2020- March 2021. I am not perfect either: ended up having a few cigs too many while drinking a few beers with my bestie in April of this year, but did not have any massive cravings or cave-ins after that (maaay have had something to do with what I can only describe as an alc AND cigarette hangover- would not wish this on anyone).

Since the pandemic I've been constantly fighting to bring myself to want to quit, but I have successfully convinced myself that I can't do without it, and every quit day after struggling through the whole day, I'd end up going out an buying a smoke in the evening, or if I was successful for a whole 24 hours, I'd go steal some tobacco from the brother-in-law and think to myself ""one cigg doesn't count, I'm still on my quit"" lol & nbsp;

I think I've spent too long of my life, letting myself off the hook, with the dumbest excuses, like ""one cigarette doesn't matter while I'm quitting, my streak is still on"" &nbsp;
🤣 &nbsp;
And I believed it. Like, what the the actual fuck! 
And how You do One thing, is how you do Everything!
I think in every other area of my life, I have given and accepted the lamest of excuses, (wow, all of this is coming out as I'm typing here, I don't think I've thunk this before) and those lame excuses have kept me in this powerless, unimpactful, unsatisfying and not just unremarkable, but almost useless life that I've been living.
Please don't misunderstand, I am not living a useless life, in the last few years, I've gotten two businesses of the ground, with no resources of my own, I've learnt about the stock market, as a complete noobie, learnt a very specific way to use statistics to make a 20% return p.a. Got a friend to trust me with his money (~$25k) and am on track to make about 25-27% for him, and am learning how to teach this on YouTube, cos anybody can do it, and it's mathematical statistics, others using it, doesn't hurt my earnings; so I've not had a useless few years, BUT IT IS USELESS compared to what I could have done, and I don't mean imaginary could've, I mean real could've.  &nbsp;

If I just didn't agree with every baby excuse my mind came up with, ""Ah, that's a perfect out!"", my life would have been so much more effective, so much more satisfying, and I would have held so much more respect for myself! (wow, this is new) 
 &nbsp;  

Today, I woke up at 530, a whole hour before my ideal wake up time, and this is someone who's  struggled to wake up before 10 or 11 or 12 :/ for years, with this thought that I can accomplished so much, if I just focus on the best, vs trying to do a whole bunch of goods along with.
""The Good is the enemy of the Best"" is a hard pill to swallow, and as I sat on the pot, trying to smoke a damp'ish, almost over, stolen-from-the-brotherinlaw, last-night's cigarette,  
&nbsp;

I kinda feel like I'm done with excuses. I'm done with excuses and with this unflattering and unsatisfying life that I'm living because of the temporary comfort in my excuses. I wanna live the hard life, the satisfying life, where the water I drink and the sleep I get is - Sweet
And where I can look at myself - with pride, and with respect. 
&nbsp;

If you've read up until here, Thank You so much for giving me an ear!!
This was meant to be a rant (cos nobody takes first-day posts so seriously) but this rant turned out to be a lot more cathartic and soul-exposing for me!
I'm gonna do this! And you can too! Let's stop living on the periphery of our best lives, but instead be there bang in the middle of it!!

After my mom died of stage 4 lung cancer caused by smoking (doctors words) just after the Christmas before last, I continued to smoke until the first week of February last year. 

It was a rocky and moody first couple months, losing my mother who I was very close with, then quitting smoking felt like losing another friend. I even lost some real friends in the process that didn’t respect my quit and I had to quit drinking in the beginning as I couldn’t drink and not smoke. I kept at it and to fast forward, I would say at about month 8 is when I really started to almost completely forget about smoking. When I was first quitting, I was looking forward to posting my 1 year on here and as it turned out, I forgot all about it. It has now been 15 months! I was a pack a day for over a decade. I am able to drink a bit again and I can even go outside with the smokers to continue the conversation without it bothering me. When they ask for a lighter I proudly say that I don’t have one. Very occasionally I will think of smoking like how you would remember an old friend you haven’t seen in years, and reminisce for a moment about what it was like when I smoked, but then the thought fades and I am glad I do not have anxiety about not having a pack on me/nearby, having to slap all my pockets to find my pack, or being a slave to an addiction.

It was the day I went to the hospital to get it checked out that I decided to quit. My girlfriend (who smoked for 20+ years) also decided to quit. We bought some nicotine gum and some lozanges and mentally prepared ourselves. I finished the pack I had over the course of a day or two (lungs felt like crap so I took it easy) and took the plunge. I didn't really follow the recommended gum ratio and instead only chewed a few pieces a day.

The first few weeks were incredibly hard, just constant pacing, depression, anger. It sucked. I couldn't get my mind off of them no matter how much I tried to distract myself. My gf called me crying from work a few times because she was having a hard time dealing with if it. She chewed much less gum than I did, as well. We only had I think 3 of the small packs of gum and that was it. I chewed most of it, but it gradually became 1 or 2 pieces a day until all the gum was gone. I didn't do many of the lozanges because they made me nauseous.

Honestly, the first few days were okay, but after about the 3rd or 4th day was when it really started to suck. About the two week point was probably the peak of the withdrawals. Gum definitely helped.

But yah, after all the gum was gone I didn't buy any more, and my gf and I have been cigarette free since April of last year. It feels good to finally be free.

Day 2: No changes or side effects. I did feel like I could put off my next smoke. Very minimal, placebo effect?

Day 3-4: Chest pain/tightness? More like on my sides.  Mild headache and fatigue by 2pm. 

Days 3-5: cigarettes tasted funny. Like metal? I continued to smoke. 

Day 6: not much craving. Smoked just because I could. May 22, 2021 @ 7:40PM. Last cigarette I will ever smoke.

I'm attempting to quit and I believe I can deal with the normal waking temptations to smoke again. However there's something that I find extremely difficult to deal with.

When I stop, for about a week, I have a horrible time with getting sleep. Now this isn't your standard dreams, just feeling like you've had bad sleep in the morning or generally waking up a lot. It's a bit deeper than that and I've yet to find anyone else with this issue, or any real advice on what to do.

Let me explain as well as I can.

When I quit and go to bed, I am woken up around a dozen times by some really powerful psychological effects. I suddenly become aware of the need to 'get away' from something mentally. When I then try to back away from that, it's the wrong thing and things get worse. I feel physically twisted, almost like I'm almost back to front. I need to untwist body, but can't work out how to do that. Every movement feels like I'm going the wrong way and I'm on the verge of severely hurting myself. Like my back might snap or something. Eventually I get out of that, but it's really very frightening.

This is not only rather scary (and so a real mental barrier to even starting the quitting process) but because I basically don't sleep, the lack of rest becomes truly miserable and with a job to hold down and two children under 5, it's so hard to get through that I often fail and have a cigarette just so that I can sleep.

Now I know that this is something to do with the area of my brain that is effected by nicotene, as when I went on Champix a few years ago, this did not happen until I came off of the Champix. All the Champix did was delay the effect and this led to me failing again.

So I don't think the way tp get through this is anything nicotene relater (NRT) but I'm kind of at my wits end of what to do.

I REALLY want to quit, but this problem is too hard to get past.

If anyone has any similar experiences, I'd love to hear about how you dealt with them and if there is anything I can try to get myself over the hum.

I've been addicted to nicotine for 25 years, I am in my early 40s now. I've stopped smoking tobacco many times, the longest for a couple of years but always fell in eventually. Now I have stopped tobacco for around 2 years, but vaped until 2 months ago. Then I had a real bad cough and switched to nicotine chewing gums (2mg), that was ok - still missed the throat hit. Then about 10 days ago I also stopped the gums.  Now, I've had some cravings, about 2-3 times per day, but its less and less and doesn't bother me too much as long as I got some regular chewing gums to keep the mouth busy.

My challenge is now to stick to it, and NOT to replace the addiction with something else. I find that the body and mind in my case now has a void which used to be filled by smoking/vaping, chewing a gum. It is all too easy to replace it with snacking, shopping, excessive eating or others. 

I think unfortunately once you been addicted to nicotine once, when stopping it, there is a void one will have to consciously be aware of and work with not to fill with other non-beneficial/ conspicuous items of consumption.

My own mother says this, and it was a major impediment to my quitting. I thought I was in for a lifetime of sporadic misery, missing something that I couldn’t have. 

The truth is that yes, after 3 years, I get the odd craving. But it is NOTHING like the kind of cravings you get while quitting, having to talk yourself out of running to the store for a pack. It’s much more like “huh, I just craved a cigarette. That’s weird!” It’s a two-second event and then you go on with your day, not even remotely thinking about buying a pack and starting again. It’s nothing. 

I just wanted to add some clarity on something I heard a lot but should absolutely not discourage anyone from quitting.

I also love the feeling that the vape gives me, like a little bit stunned, for a little while, and relaxed.

What helped me quitting:
I set my Stop-Date a month in advance,
First thing i changed was the way i smoked:
Every time i lit up a cig. I thought about my quit date, and that i don‘t need the cigarettes any longer.
Additionally i started smoking with all my senses, wich means, no talking, no phone, just focusing on the smoke. The important step is, to keep this routine. As it helps you to feel, how bad the cigarettes are. I even came to the point, 3-5 days before i quit, that i was looking forward on quitting, and i am happy now, that i am 5 days in, with nearly no cravings..

Because... I smoke then I give up then I start again, then give up, etc. etc. I know it might not be encouraging for other people to hear, but I've made my peace with it, I'd prefer to stop once and for all but I doubt that will happen because drunk me loves cigarettes, but honestly, I'm happy to settle with the 6-8 month quits I get every 8-18 months... definitely better than nothing.

(Every time I give up, it just happens, it's just the right moment, I wake up and I stop smoking, easy as pie. Exactly the way Allen Carr describes it. Except his book didn't work for me. It worked for 24 hours then I got the angriest I've ever been about smoking and started again. I've also previously successfully used vaping, patches, nicotine minis, lozenges, gum, the full array. I'm an expert in giving up for 6-8 months.)

Anyways, I stopped again 3 months ago. Normally after 3 weeks or so I get awful bronchitis. Last time I had it was January 2020... it was a great time to have an awful smokers cough.

This time, I didn't get the awful smokers cough, which sort of worries me (maybe after quitting billions of times, now aged 35 my body can't be bothered to clean out the tar?!). For the last month though I have had a mildly sore chest and every morning I wake up with a really dry, uncomfortable throat. I'm also exhausted. I was thinking about asking a doctor about it, but it's not a great time to ask doctors about sore throats and chests.

Any thoughts? Surely 3 months is too late into a quit for it to be giving me a sore throat, no? I've had it for at least 3 weeks.

I normally smoke at least 20 cigarettes a day, could sometimes get up to 30, but I think over the last year I probably averaged out about only 5 a day, as there were long periods where I only smoked a couple in the morning.

His main claim is that smoking being enjoyable is the greatest illusion ever, and that the only reason smoking does anything is it relieving ur withdrawal urges, and hence appearing as a boost.  


This sounds like complete nonsense to me. Literally any addicting drug on earth has a particular effect on the brain. Caffeine for example is not only enjoyable when ur addicted to it, it has a very real effect regardless of addiction. Nicotine is exactly the same, and has actually been shown to be a cognitive booster. I very much enjoyed cigarettes far before I was addicted in any real sense of the word.  


The point I'm trying to make is not that you should smoke. It's terrible and the health damage outweighs any positive effects you might get from it. However the whole Alan Carr mantra is that ""smoking being enjoyable is a lie"" is literally stupid and almost culty. It's like telling a heroin junkie that he should quit because actually the drug is not pleasureable at all, it's just an illusion.

2021-05-13 16:59:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/nbra3c/im_desperate/,I'm desperate,"Hey everyone! I'm 21 year old female. I don't know if this is the right place to post even but any help is welcome. As the title says I'm totally lost and torn between mental disorders such as depression, anorexia, bulimia anxiety, BPD and everyday life problems such as quitting smoking and stopping antidepressants as my therapist recommended...
I've developed first signs of anorexia 9 years ago, I was quite chubby kid and my mum was always obsessed with all of us looking all nice and fit, she wanted me to look nice and dresss nice and feel nice and being fat was restraining me from that ""happpines"". Anyway I'm not sure if I should mention numbers here but as an anorexic I went from chubby to really skinny in short time frame. Smoking cigarettes helped with that a lot. Everytime I was hungry I would just smoke a cigarette or two and suddenly I'm full. After 4 years of anorexia I started working a part time student job in a restaurant and vecause of my bad relationship with food it didn't take long for me to develop bulimia. I gained about 15 kgs in 2 months and was finally looking healthy, started getting compliments on my looks etc, little did they know I was just digging myself deeper pit. I would eat enormous amounts of really unhealthy food and as easy as it sounds I would just visit toilet a little too often. No matter how hungry or full I am, food couldn't and mustn't stay inside me at no cost. 
It was all tolerant until my health started to rapidly worsen, I lost all my energy, shortness of breath, sleeping problems, very slow digestion, hair loss, teeth started to rot...
2 years ago I finally decided to get help and work it out, unfortunately, no luck. I tried 4 therapists and non had any interest in my problem, I would wait all month for my next appointment and they would just ""be over with me"" after 10 minutes. I tried 6 different antidepressants and 4 anxiolytics and non had any use. They would just make me feel numb and careless about purging, maybe even killed my motivation a bit. After I realized no one will help me, things got a bit better and bulimia was still present and I would still binge amd purge few times a week, but I at least I ate normal amount of food through the day while still smoking a pack a day. 
Anway, 2 days ago I decided to quit smoking, and 3 days ago my therapist decided I should quit my antidepressants because of mood swings so she sees what we're dealing with beneath all that. The problem is, my next appointment is in two weeks and I feel so depressed, miserable and fat. Instead of smoking I just binge random snacks such as chips or fries, chocolate, tons of candy and gums... I am so bloated, for sure gained some weight and I feel like my bulimia has worsen a lot because of this. I feel awful and fat and I can't stand it but at the same time, as hard as it is, I don't think smoking would help me either... Maybe short term, but I know as soon as I finish that cigarette I'm gonna regret it. Sorry for a long rant, I just don't know what to do and who to talk to. All my friends are smokers so I know they'll be biased.
My final exams are getting really close and I'm scared and anxious because I can't focus one bit and occupy my time with ton of part time jobs just so I don't have to be with myself. I dont even know what's the point of this post, I just need some optimism and maybe your experience with similar problems. Is now even the right time to stop smoking?

First chapter was quite scientific, i struggled to follow some sections, key take away was learning about how nicotine operates. After that chapter the realisation starts. The author very intelligently and honestly busts all excuses one can make to continue smoking...i remembered all of those because in the past they were the reasons i got back to smoking or never gave up. 

I never read chapter 5 because when i finished reading ch 4, was filled with so much rage against nicotine...literally fuming.  Didnt even think, “oh it s mid day let me finish the half pack i got since i already paid for and quit fresh the next morning”!


The big realisation for me was “nicotine tricked my own brain to knowingly fuck my body”. It was just that moment really. Never looked back. The sweat gone, it all got easier.

I'm still going strong though.  Had about 15 cravings since I quit over 2 weeks ago and gave in to none.  I just quit cold turkey and not on any NRT or vaping.  Just wanted to be rid of all these addictions and get used to being a non-smoker full stop.  Smoked for over 30 years about under a pack a day.

I still am congested every morning when I wake up and have a blocked nose.  So I need to clear my nose with a tissue.  

Plus side:

\- Breathing much deeper now

\- Feel a whole lot cleaner in my body, like no residues in my body

\- Body does feel like it's detoxifying

\- I have more stamina when exercising

\- I have learnt to let the cravings pass which takes about 1-2 min 

\- Sometimes, the cravings are sooo strong but I just can't undo all this work.  I definitely can never just have 'ONE' cigarette.  

\- I feel more mature and responsible about my life

\- I feel like a good person and not so rebellious as I had done when I took up smoking as a teen

\- I am looking forward to being quit at a year and reaping the benefits of being a non-smoker

\- I look forward to having reduced sinitus after 5-10 years

I used smoking to mask my depression.  But I think it made me feel worse at times.  It was a coping mechanism and such a cop out.  I don't blame myself as it was how I dealt with my life at the time.  But I need to learn natural coping mechanisms to deal with setbacks in life.  I just wish I wasn't so tired.

2021-05-12 19:27:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/nb2k4r/my_experience/,My experience,"I have smoked since I was 13-14, which became a regular habit after I turned 15 which in my early years supplemented my habit from re-allocating my parents cigarettes, to waiting outside kiosks for friendly buyers, or from my older friends until I was legal. I am now 27 (and will be 28 this year). When I was around 21-22 I switched from the auto's (regular cigarettes) over to rollies, which I have smoked up until now. Alongside this habit since I was about 15-16 I have regularly consumed marijuana and hashish, which shortly after also became a daily habit which later became a preferred mixer with rolling cigarettes, which I combined for the most part unless it was socially unacceptable, I was at work, because I didn't have any, or was trying to conserve, then I would just smoke cigarettes. Despite all this I am reasonably healthy and have been fairly productive, both on the educational and work aspects, generally maintaining my life in a way that society and I would find acceptable. That said, last summer (maybe precipitated by the pandemic or age) I seem to have fallen into some sort of existential quarter life crisis where I began to re-evaluate many aspects of my life. ""Attempted"" to quit the greenery a few times in this period but only truly successfully terminated my relationship with that roughly a month ago with all the withdrawal effects that it entails. Following this, my intake of cigarettes (and alcohol to some extent) increased heavily (predictably, as a crutch). 

Up until about 3 days ago, I only really attempted to quit cigarettes once before while I was in holiday in Italy around the time I was 21 with my then girlfriend, ended up falling back on that within a day or two due to the psychological effects and because I didn't want to it to mess up my holiday. It was the reason I switched over to rolling cigarettes, but quitting it has been in the back of my head for years now and grown to be the elephant in the room. A symbol of my lack of willpower. That no matter what I achieve, if I can't quit this, then what real control do I have. This is the backbone to my cold turkey now, and the reason I refuse to supplement it with patches, snus, nicotinell, or ever go back to it. I guess it's because I really want to but everybody is different. Since I really enjoy a smoke while I drink, I have also decided to go on a long dry run on the alcohol too. The strangest thing is that I have no cravings for smoking at all, but I feel the physical effects of withdrawal: The dull headaches and slightly sick feeling have set in, my body is restless and jittery, I can't sleep properly or focus while I'm awake, and when I do sleep I randomly wake up with cold sweats in the middle of the night. Despite this, the worst part for me is the psychological aspect - my mood is fluctuating through lows and highs, I don´t feel like myself or perceive in a way I usually would, irritations, depression, mind playing tricks on me, the whole enchilada. I'm up late with the aim of reading literature and writing parts for my research project but ended up in here. It's cliche in a way, but there is a time and a place and you really have to want this for it to be possible. I want to be the best version of myself in mind, body and spirit that I possibly can be and that is my driving force. A lot of it is a mental game, so don't let the withdrawal con you.

I'm 21 years old, I've been on and off smoking disposables for about 3 years now. I've just recently went on a 4-month run of nothing but nicotine every single day and every single hour.

A few days ago I passed my 100th day without nicotine and I decided to share a detailed post about how I did it and what was my experience like. The idea behind this is to give at least a bit of an idea of what you may expect when you decide to quit. I will be brutally honest and will not sugarcoat anything I felt. 

I am aware that everyone’s experience is different, but I hope that my post would still be helpful in some way. 


Some details: 

I’m a female, 24 years old. Smoked a pack a day for about 2-3 years. I was REALLY addicted. I would literally speed unto panic mode if I knew that I’m running out of cigarettes and I would avoid social occasions during which I knew I couldn’t smoke. I was known as the girl who was always puffing a cigarette. I couldn’t even imagine myself as a non-smoker and thought I genuinely enjoyed cigarettes.



How I quit: 

I cut off the cigarettes cold turkey after reading Alan Carr’s book. However, I was still a bit unsure about myself, so I used nicotine patches for the first two weeks (I know that the book goes against it, but that’s how I decided to do it). The first week I used the 15mg ones (one a day) and the second week the 10mg ones (one a day as well). I would put the patch on as soon as I wake up and would remove it before bed. 

Day 1: 

I got my period the same day, so I spent the majority of the day laying on the couch. It went easier than I expected. Got a few cravings but it wasn’t unmanageable. Whenever I got a craving I would talk with my fiancé or call a friend and ask them to distract me. It seemed to help.

Day 2: 

Woke up with a headache and acid reflux. On terms of cravings it was the same as day 1, but I got one massive craving after I had a big meal for dinner. I had a few mint candies and had a long shower to resist. Overall it was not super challenging, but I had a few bad moments throughout the day. 

Days 3 to 7: 

Not going to lie, those days were horrible. I continued having headaches, the acid reflux got crazy and I noticed that my anxiety got so much worse (I am diagnosed with panic disorder, which is manageable most of the time and I don’t take any medications anymore). I felt restless (like I couldn’t sit at one place), my sleep was really disrupted and I would have continuous dreams that I’m smoking, after which I would wake up feeling a mixture of guilt and desire to smoke. I also started to cough and would always feel something like mucus on my throat. It was disgusting. 

Something which I was not expecting - I was ANGRY. Like things that I would normally pay zero attention to would get me irritated. 

The “highlight” of my anger was when I snapped at one of my friends for smoking in front of me (which my addicted brain took as “you don’t support me”) while we were FaceTiming. I felt horrible immediately and apologised numerous times. Thankfully she understood me and gave me a very good advice: LOLLIPOPS! It may sound weird but lollipops helped me so so much. Something about keeping not only your mouth, but also your hands occupied made fighting cravings so much easier. I would get different flavours and would genuinely enjoy them. 

I got through those few days by relying on my stubbornness and doing things which brought me good emotions - long showers, conversations with close people, music, nice movies. Also, I had a piece of paper where I had written down all my reasons to quit. Whenever I felt like it was getting challenging I would take a look at it. It may sound cheesy, but it helped. At the end of each day I would take a minute to pat myself on the back and say to myself “yeah girl, you’re a tough bitch!”


Weeks 2 to 4: 

Things were getting easier. The headaches disappeared after the first week, the acid reflux around week 3 and my sleep went progressively back to normal. I was still coughing though. I started “exposing” myself to smoke, like not asking my mother to not smoke in front of me anymore.

My emotional state also got progressively better. The anger slowly disappear, the cravings were getting less frequent and less intense. I was slowly starting to feel like myself again. 

A change I noticed is that my appetite went slightly up. I was not eating bigger meals than normal but I would snack much more frequently. I gained 2kg, but it didn’t worry me because I wanted to gain a little bit of weight anyways. 

Weeks 4 to 8: 

The coughing disappeared completely around week 6. Cravings were almost non existent anymore. I noticed that not only I don’t feel the need to smoke anymore, but that actually cigarette smoke was starting to smell disgusting for me. 

The major change I felt during this period was how I felt physically. I live on the top of something like a hill and I would feel shortness of breath every time I walked up to my house. One day as I was unlocking the door it hit me that my breathing was absolutely normal - something which I haven’t experienced for years. I smiled to myself like an idiot for the next half an hour. 

My anxiety was also getting better and around the 8th week it was the same level as before I quit. Appetite was still increased. I gained 1 more kg and I actually reached my goal weight.

Weeks 8 to 12: 

Cravings completely gone. After week 8 I started feeling the positive effects of quitting with full power. My energy levels skyrocketed, my skin got so much better (didn’t expect that one), and I’m not even going to start on my much fuller wallet!

Something surprising: my anxiety continued to decrease and now it’s definitely lower than when I was still smoking. Turns out that when Alan Carr said in the book that cigarettes don’t make you calmer but actually make your anxiety worse, he was right. 




Aftermath: 

I don’t know exactly when this happened, but I stopped associating myself with the term “smoker” or “in the process of quitting”. The thought of lighting up disgusts me. I didn’t even realise it was already 100 days, my app reminded me

Here’s a small part of what I’ve gained by quitting: my anxiety got better, I’m a lot more energetic, I don’t have random coughs anymore, no more smelling like an ashtray, my skin is glowing, I reached my goal weight, I went back to working out 6 times a week, I have so much more money, I don’t feel guilty for poisoning myself anymore. And my stage 2 cellulite disappeared on its own. I don’t know if it has something to do with quitting, but it’s a discovery I made when I put on a short skirt for the first time this year a few days ago. 

Do I miss smoking: absolutely no! 




Was it worth it:

1000%!!!!! Looking back I can confidently say that the challenging times are nothing compared to what you’ll gain when you quit. If I did it you can do it as well!




Advice: 

- Read Alan Carr’s book if you haven’t. If you already did and it didn’t change your view of smoking - read it again. Most of the advice which I would give is from there, so I would not write everything down and will just advice you to read it

- Remember that the human mind is capable of much more than you think. It’s all in your head. If you are stubborn and put yourself in a state of mind that you CAN do it, you will.

- Get prepared with pills for headaches and acid reflux

- Find your comfort things and do more of them

- Write a list of all your reasons to quit and read them frequently 



What I did to fight cravings:

- Lollipops 
- Chewing on wooden stirring sticks
- Working out
- Mints
- Long showers
- Talking with close people 
- Dancing 
- Getting occupied with something like doing my nails, plucking my eyebrows, cleaning etc

I started eating high meat every day. After eating it for about a month I switched from smoking weed every day to eating edibles. I did the edibles for about a week and then I just stopped. Then I didn't even crave it anymore. I've tried to quit smoking like 15 timse, everytime I still had intense cravings. This last time, I quit and didn't even want it anymore. Easy. Also if you are quitting cigarrettes, high meat will help, but withdrawals is poisons coming out of the body, consume half teaspoon of cheese every 10 minutes that you experience withdrawals until it goes away. Raw unsalted cheese (unpasteurized never heated above 104) absorbs poisons like crazy. It'll literally just stop the withdrawals. Consume fresh raw unpasteurized cucumber and celery juice to stabalize mood and prevent irritability. Do not drink more than 1.5 tablespoons every 30 seconds. Drinking liquids too fast will cause it not to be digested. Poisons coming out of the system causes blood to become extra acidic and result in irritability, the vegetable juice stabalizes it. All this information can be understood by studying Aajonus Vonderplanitz. ( [aajonus.online](https://aajonus.online) ). If you want help, message me. It can be easy to quit. You just have to know what foods to eat to balance the withdrawals and make it easy.

I can chew raw organic fresh tobacco leaves every day and quit without withdrawals. That's because its not toxic. Cigarrettes are loaded with poison, and its bound with the nicotine. So when you quit the poison comes out with the nicotine. So getting raw organic tobacco from an amish farm and chewing a little bit every day can help. Don't chew much or it'll give you pneumonia. Study Aajonus to understand the details.

When you reach the early milestones, one week, one month, even three months, and you are certain you’ve got this, remain mindful.  

Keep the tools you used on your first day at arms reach.  I still have a drawer full of chewing gum and sugar free candy to help with the unexpected craves.  I don’t have many anymore and when I do they’re fleeting but every now and again I have a particularly stressful day and old habits demand nicotine but I’m prepared for them.  I have my weapons.  I haven’t relapsed this time for just that reason.

Prior to this quit, I relapsed over and over.  I was so confident I’d never go back to smoking but nicotine is sneaky and I’m not always as tough as I’d like to believe.  Maybe you won’t need the gum or straws or whatever but I’d rather have them and not need them than end up at a corner store asking for a pack of smokes after a cashier notes she hasn’t seen me in a long while.

2021-05-10 11:07:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/n972z8/i_smoked_my_last_cigarette_today/,I smoked my last cigarette today.,"When I was growing up, my dad was a smoker. My mom and brothers and myself hated it, but he was trapped. He continued on smoking for many years, mostly hiding it. I'd constantly find him in the backyard smoking a secret cigarette, and when I would approach him he'd throw it away, thinking I didn't see. He reeked of cigarette smoke and I knew it was killing him. I used to fantasize as a kid about one day growing up and battling the tobacco industry, to one day see cigarettes be illegal.

I chewed tobacco for the first time in college, and I was instantly hooked. The buzz was exciting and it felt like I was rebelling. I grew up in a turbulent household and I was trying to find my identity. Since March 2013, I have smoked/chewed/vaped on and off for 8 years. I would quit for 7 months at a time, and then have ""just one cigarette"" and fall back into the trap. But I always told myself I was a nonsmoker. In November 2019, I got sober from alcohol. I've since gotten sober from cannabis and caffeine, as I use all of these substances as an escape. But nicotine came roaring back this March and I told myself, well, at least I was managing the other substances. 

I have felt miserable these past two months smoking cigarettes, but I wasn't able to stop. Smoking was at odds with my values. I work in an environmental field and am passionate about the natural world. But I still stubbed out those butts on the ground and have left them there. I have been an athlete my whole life, running, biking, climbing, hiking. But I smoked those cigarettes knowing it was terrible for my health. I am in recovery from other substances and talk to others about how wonderful it is. But I still stayed addicted to this cruel substance. I am vulnerable and open and compassionate with my friends, family, and girlfriend. But I still hid the fact that I was smoking cigarettes. I am passionate about my job and work hard. But I still took breaks to smoke, and had to lay on the couch after because I was so lethargic, avoiding doing work. I have committed deeply to addressing trauma from my childhood and finding peace in my life. I see a trauma therapist, do movement therapy, practice mindfulness meditation. But I still inhale toxic fumes and feel horrible about myself. 

I read a few chapters of Allen Carr's EasyWay a few times over the past few years to help myself quit. In turn, I really was using the willpower method to white knuckle it to many months away from nicotine. This time around, I finally read the whole thing. It came time this morning to smoke the final, mindful cigarette. I didn't want to. I knew it was going to be horrible, but I made myself do it. I smoked it in my backyard on a rainy, gray morning, and it was horrible. It tasted terrible; it reeked. I felt my throat and head get congested as I smoked it. My knees were trembling since I hadn't eaten breakfast yet. I felt myself losing the ability to breathe deeply. I got a brief, but fleeting head buzz that just left me disoriented. And then I stubbed it out on the ground, threw away all the loose butts in my backyard, and broke all of the cigarettes in my pack in half. I read the warning labels on the pack one more time: 

> ""Quitting smoking drastically decreases risk of death."" 

> ""Smoking will kill you.""

And then I puked. I was so nauseated by how disgusting the cigarette tasted and felt. It was a cathartic experience, and I just felt elated to be totally free of the trap. I am finally free, and it feels different this time -- it feels like a permanent change. I'm excited to put this behind me and continue to do the work on mindfulness, recovery, and therapy, free of this vice. I'm excited to feel energy again and drop that feeling of insecurity and shame about smoking. **I'm one hour free from nicotine!**",43,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9749420285224915}"

I've always wondered why there are so many avenues for an addict. Not only do AA and NA members almost always all smoke, they'll often use it as a crutch/social lubricant to communicate and get off of another drug. Yet smokers are considered ""regular"" people with a ""bad habit."" 

My father was a heroin addict and smoker of 60+ years, and died. My mother, still a smoker for 40+, and an alcoholic. I feel I'll never escape this trap.

I would consider myself a tense person. I've always suffered from anxiety and depression.  And smoking has not only been a crutch, a release, a friend, and a foe; it's continued to be a solution for all of the problems it creates. 

At this moment, I find myself spun up in a frenzy, looking for help and looking for some sort of strength I can't find in myself. I've fought lighting up a cig and all the shame and submission that comes with it. 

People love to dismiss cigarette addiction like it's merely a subtle inclination you feel before chewing too much gum.  But it killed my dad, it kills my mom, and I always feel like it's on its way to me. 

There's a heavy notion of ""it'll all be ok,"" before I'm about to smoke, and an even heavier feeling of shame after I finally give in. 

I've tried all of the NRTs, cold turkey/will power, and I've even read Alan Carr's Easyway to Stop Smoking, yet I feel hopeless

I am new here. I am going to be documenting my days on this thread for everyone to see. I have been vaping for only half a year, and I am already starting to regret starting. Prior to starting, I never had any nicotine.

I quit smoking weed, and I needed something to cope. I was trying to join the military and I needed something to cope with the fact that I was super depressed at the time, and I needed to calm down over certain things that were going on in my life. 

I made a promise to myself this week.

1. Vaping is killing me, and is destroying my mental stability and killing my lungs.
2. I can not afford too relapse, because I have recently been furloughed do the the covid-19 pandemic, and I can't afford to be spending any more money.
3. If I relapse, I probably won't be able to ever quit vaping
4. I can't do this alone, and I have asked my friends to help me emotionally get over the cravings of nicotine.
5. I needed to find an online community for advice on how I am going to overcome this.

I hope this subreddit is okay with me documenting all of this. I hope my presence is welcome.

Cos I do,"What a great day it is - I haven't smoked in 4 months and one day! :) Cold turkey after 20 / day for two years, having smoked for many more years before that throughout my 20s.

What do I mean by this title? Well, I'll tell you what I don't mean: I don't mean that I'm feeling cravings (I have none anymore; maybe the occasional vestige of that awful addiction does strike, but I'm strong enough to brush it off now). I don't mean that life is harder without that crutch, that false friend. It isn't harder; it's easier. Much easier. I like myself for the first time in a while, have more money, more energy... So what do I mean?

I've tried to quit many times before. So many times. I eventually felt like a failure because of how many times I relapsed. It harmed my self confidence a lot, but I kept trying, despite my fears that I would relapse. It was a terrible mindset. I've also had other addictions. Many of them - to porn, eating large amounts of food, internet addiction, gambling, coffee. Thankfully never drugs or drink expect for a time when I'm sure I was self medicating depression with weed for too long and without any supervision. I now realise that all of these addictions stem from an emptiness inside me that I try to fill. Where that emptiness comes from is probably some pain that as caused when I was younger (read Gabor Mate on addictions if you want a proper explanation of this dynamic. He's a great doctor and writer).

In the past 4 months, I've been systematically knocking each of this addictions on the head, one after the other. AS soon as I have the strength to get in the ring again, I tackle the next one on the list. Then, I focus my energy on that until I feel I have a handle on it. Then re-energise and repeat. I feel like I'm chipping away at a block of marble to uncover the sculpture at the core. It is great. I feel successful and, indeed, I'm succeeding slowly but surely in other areas of my life. This is a great journey. You should take it too, despite how scary it might be. You will look back at your previous self and marvel at how far you've come and want to keep going.

So what do I mean by the title? Well, I believe that smoking is self-destructive - obviously. And I believe that we all know we're destroying ourselves with this awful addiction, because there is a very very subtle voice inside of us that wants to destroy us. It says to us that we're not worthy of the good things we want for ourselves - not worthy of love, or success, or good health, or having a bank account with some funds in it. It wants to keep us down. But smoking is a genius addiction, because it convinces that it's actually enhancing our lives. We blind ourselves to the reality. It's really quite amazing how it works on our psyche.

I began this journey knowing that I smoke to avoid reality, to fill the void inside. It is the faithful friend, the thing I can turn to (which in reality, is nothing at all except poison and unhappiness). I began the journey knowing that whenI got to the point of feeling successful - as I do now, to an extent - I would try subconsciously to undo my success, to subvert everything I have achieved. I guess it is low-self-esteem that drives me - perhaps.

ΣΤΑΜΑΤΗΣΤΕ ΤΟ ΚΑΠΝΙΣΜΑ ΓΙΑ ΝΑ ΖΗΣΕΤΕ ΠΕΡΙΣΣΟΤΕΡΟ

Οι μισοί από τους μακροχρόνιους καπνιστές πεθαίνουν νωρίς από ασθένειες που σχετίζονται με το κάπνισμα, συμπεριλαμβανομένων καρδιακών παθήσεων, καρκίνου του πνεύμονα και χρόνιας βρογχίτιδας.

Οι άνδρες που σταμάτησαν το κάπνισμα έως την ηλικία των 30 προσθέτουν 10 χρόνια στη ζωή τους. Οι άνθρωποι που σταματούν τη συνήθεια στα 60 προσθέτουν 3 χρόνια στη ζωή τους.

Με άλλα λόγια, δεν είναι ποτέ πολύ αργά για να επωφεληθείτε από τη διακοπή. Η απαλλαγή από το κάπνισμα όχι μόνο προσθέτει χρόνια στη ζωή σας, αλλά επίσης βελτιώνει σημαντικά τις πιθανότητές σας για να μην ασθενήσετε και επίσης να έχετε πιο ευτυχισμένα γηρατειά.

But he is so excited to be a grandpa and I really want him around my child for a long time. He has lost two siblings to lung cancer, one recently. 

I got him the Alan Carr book, which he is reading slowly. I also am in the process of getting him patches.

I believe he has a history of unmedicated anxiety and depression, so I think Wellbutrin could be great for him, but he says he doesn’t have anxiety or depression. Our entire family agrees he likely does but of course we don’t want to push him.

I am trying to quit smoking and I feel like my girlfriend of 2 years is making it difficult. I don't smoke cigarettes however I've been smoking black & milds on and off for 4 years(smoke for 3 months and stop for 2 years type deal). Usually I just decide to stop and after a painful couple of weeks and it's no problem. 

My girlfriend has been a cig smoker since long before we met. I started smoking those with her but it felt and tasted awful so I convinced her to stop for both of our health. We admittedly get the craving to smoke after a drink or two. One night early last year, we were drinking and both wanted to smoke. I was still in the right enough mind to know that I should not be smoking cigs and suggested the black & mild as sort of a one time one and done deal.

Since then we've both fallen off track and have been consistently smoking 2-3 a day. We usually share but sometimes we'll puff on our own throughout the day. A few months ago I brought up quitting again and she agreed. This is where the problem comes in.

I'll go a few days without smoking and she'll come home from work with a half smoked black & mild asking if I want to go outside with her. I know I shouldn't but the cravings take over and I cave. Similarly if we're out drinking she'll ask and once again cravings take over and I cave. Lastly, the thing that's bothering me the most is that she'll suggest buying one whether we're drinking or not and when I say no and explain that we shouldn't I'm just met with excuse after excuse. Eventually I get frustrated and tell her to do what she wants, telling myself that I won't partake however she'll go buy it, bring it home and even if it's not the first few puffs I always end up taking some hits off of it. 

I can't pretend that I've been the strongest either. I've also told her that I want a black & mild and am going to buy one but I'm met with no resistance. While anytime she brings it up I try to stop her. Yes, I'm a hypocrite. I understand that it's my responsibility to quit for myself. I hope everyone here understands that it's hard. This has also been an issue with saving money. We'll have a long talk about saving and even come up with a plan and the next day she's eating out for lunch, going drinking with co workers and buying stuff online but I guess that's another discussion.

Up until now I've been alone so quitting smoking and sticking to savings plans hasn't been an issue. I feel like I can't quit if she keeps smoking and bringing it up. Does anyone who's gone through this have any advice?",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9931802749633789}"

Approximately 2 years ago, I smoked the last cigarette of my life, or so I thought. I was well-prepared - downloaded the stop smoking app, read the Alan Carr book, and knew how to take care of cravings from previous attempts. For one year, I didn't smoke a single puff. I picked up running and working out and generally became a lot healthier and more energetic.

Seems like a happy ending, but - as I now know - it's never fully over. 'I can have a single one' and similar thoughts started to come up more and more. What I build up in a year (and half a year of failed attempts beforehand), I broke down in the past nine months. A few moments:

1. July: drunk night, having drinks with friends. A lot of them smoked. At the end of the night, I caved and smoked a few cigarettes ('it can't hurt right???'). The taste was disgusting, but when you're drunk you don't seem to realise it that much
2. July-september: smoking often while drinking with friends who smoke. I started out bumming cigarettes, but after a while I bought my own packs again. Only rule was: don't take it back home. That rule never lasts.
3. September: After a fight with my (at the time) girlfriend and a stressful week at work, I stole a cigarette from one of my housemates. Suddenly, the 'stressful nights' started to happen more often as I was looking for an excuse for a cigarette
4. September-December: somewhere in this period I just always started smoking when having a drink, whether I was with friends who smoke or not.
5. January-April: As was inevitable, I just started smoking again. Went from a few cigarettes a day, back to my old habits of smoking approximately 12 a day.

&#x200B;

**Where I am now**

I tried to quit a few times over the past month, but on a second read, the Alan Carr book was not as magical for me as it was the first time around. In other words: cravings were quite tough on me this time around. I am now free for five days, and I deeply know that I have smoked the last cigarette of my life. I picked my old running habit up again and am working towards half a marathon together with a friend. I won't make that while smoking, so smoking again is not really an option right now.

Hi fellow quitters or the ones contemplating!

I have quit 3rd of January 2021 which is a little over 120 days now. I am very very happy I was able to stay quit for so long. I smoked 2 packs of cigs a day since I was 16. I am 46 now... I was not using any NRT. 

Living without cigarettes makes life easier in so many ways. I wish all the strength to stay quit and the ones contemplating to find the right trigger and the necessary long-term commitment. 🤞🤞🤞

There is a free, scientifically proven way to stop smoking that you may be unaware of.  Techniques of using drugs like Varenicline and the one I will explain are the two methods the medical community focuses on currently.  Other techniques lack scientific data about how effective they are.  I will explain the technique to you using my experience as a scientist and medical student.  I will provide you with links to studies supporting this technique that are freely accessible on the internet. This way, you can at least make a decision on whether to try the technique based upon facts.  

**What is the gist of this technique to stop smoking**

The gist of the technique I am sharing with you is to help you to organize your efforts to reduce smoking into six stages.  The stage you begin in does not matter.  You can then combine ten actions at each stage to progress to the next stage.  The more you use each action, the more likely you are to progress to the next stage.  If your progression is reversed for any reason, you will have an organized manner to stop the reversal and to begin progressing towards stopping again.  

**What are the 6 stages of quitting tobacco**

The six steps are:

Pre-contemplation

Contemplation

Preparation

Action

Maintenance

Relapse

**What are the 10 processes that help me to quit tobacco**

The ten processes are:

Consciousness raising 

Self-liberation 

Social liberation 

Self-reevaluation 

Environmental reevaluation 

Counterconditioning 

Stimulus control 

Reinforcement management 

Dramatic relief 

Helping relationships

**Tell me the details of the pre-contemplation stage of quitting tobacco**

**Tell me the details of the processes to use in the pre-contemplation stage** 

**Tell me how to progress to the next stage in my journey to stop smoking**

**Repeat for stages 2-6**

I am writing a free, online guide to quitting tobacco.  I am seeking feedback on the guide as I prepare it for release.  Please feel free to leave a comment if you like or if you disagree with the organization of my guide.  Any other feedback would also be greatly appreciated.

2021-05-05 09:39:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/n5g5ek/20_days_nicotine_free/,20 days nicotine free,"Here I am, going on Week 3. Some reflections:

I quit using Allen Carr’s book. It’s pretty similar to hypnotism, in that it brainwashes you into believing that you don’t even like cigarettes. I highly recommend going this route for anyone who wants to quit, because it hugely mitigates many of the negative withdrawal symptoms (depression, anxiety, irritability).  I’m no doctor, but it seems like these symptoms are psychosomatic, not physiological, and can be bypassed with the right mental attitude. The only symptoms I’ve been experiencing this time have been fatigue and cravings.

The cravings are easily dealt with if you truly believe that smoking is dumb, and they get easier to deal with the more you say no. For the fatigue, I’ve been drinking an extra cup of coffee throughout the day - it’s another crutch, and I’m sure it’s not great for my cardiovascular health, but I figure it’s better than nicotine/tobacco.

Despite the brainwashing, there is still one time of day that I really crave a cigarette, and that is first thing in the morning. Historically, I have never been a morning person. I am a very heavy sleeper, and have a real difficult time getting out of bed in the morning. Previously, I was able to be dressed and ready to hit the streets within 5 minutes of waking up. 

Moreover, I’m starting to realize how much I used smoking as a “life hack” to get around difficult parts of life. It’s slowly dawning on me that part of quitting is developing life skills, such as waking up, that other people had to figure out as teens and young adults, but I am just now learning for the first time in my 30s. 

So, even though I managed to avoid some of the difficult aspects of cessation, it’s still not all sunshine and rainbows. Challenging work lies ahead. It can frustrating to play catch-up—but then again, it’s a god damn miracle I was even able to quit. I just have different problems now.

Anybody else find that quitting exposed gaps in their personal development? Do you have any tips for making the transition from the short-term “quitting” to the long-term “becoming a non-smoker”?",48,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8670498132705688}"

SO DON’T DO THAT PLEASE. IT PROBABLY WON’T EVEN HELP YOU.

Okay, so I(30f) had to quit smoking last week due to an upcoming surgery. I started when I was 16 and it’s been a major crutch for my ADHD and anxiety so I was pissed off and annoyed and hopeful and scared about having to quit smoking.

The first day of my quit was mostly dread and a sense impending doom knowing the withdrawals would be starting shortly.

The second day was hell. I freaked out, called in sick to work, went to an acupuncturist (even though I’m a skeptic), and went to a hypnotist (even though I’m a skeptic). Pure desperation. I started to feel pretty okay toward the afternoon and by the time I left the hypnotist (still can’t believe I went to a fucking hypnotist lmfaooooo) I had no cravings or withdrawals.

I kept waiting for the symptoms to come back around but they never did. Not that night or the next day or the next day. Just never came back! I started researching how that could be possible and found a study that indicates stimulant meds can ease nicotine withdrawals and cravings in some people who have ADHD. I take stimulants daily so I had to test it. The next day I skipped my morning dose and sure enough the craving and headache and that feeling of something being missing in your SOUL came right back. Took the meds and all of the symptoms disappeared within the hour.

Clearly this is not the most scientific test and the whole situation is anecdotal but being able to quit cold turkey and only feel like garbage for ~24hrs is the most insanely wonderful outcome ever so I just have to share in case it can help someone else to have an easier quit.

Study link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3065552/

Some info to note:
- The study has a small sample size
- It appears to only work for people with ADHD (because a baseline dopamine deficit is required if the hypothesis is correct)
- I’ve been vaping zero nicotine liquid since I quit so I can focus on getting off nicotine and I plan to break the psychological addiction to my glorified pacifier on my surgery date
- I am not a medical professional. Do your own due diligence and don’t make health-impacting decisions when your brain is in desperation mode!

I have a problem while quitting, which constantly leads me to relapse.  
Here is what happening:

* I really consider quitting because of the fear of many smoking-related diseases
* I am aware that the sooner I stop smoking the better are the chances of not getting them
* Still I have some kind of fear that I already did an irreversible damage to my body

So my mind leads me into some kind of a trap: I should stop to save my health, but if I already have irreversible damage I no longer see a point in quitting. This gets fueled even more when I read success stories of people not smoking for months and then suddenly dying of smoking-related diseases. I know that it is my mind playing tricks on me and preventing me from quitting, but I still can't find a proper way to fight it.

Somehow it's 10 years since then! While those first days, weeks and months were somewhat challenging, it's amazing how easy the following years have been.

At some point I became a non-smoker, as opposed to ex-smoker, and seemingly forgot all about cigarettes.  

I had always been one of those people that thought ""Yeah, one day I'll hopefully get round to quitting"".  But that one day turned into years.  Then something just kind of clicked (helped by a sinus infection at the time) and here we are.

These 10 years have been as much a journey of developing self-worth and self-respect as they have anything about nicotine addiction.  The confidence gained from seemingly achieving what I once considered impossible has been invaluable.  

I still wrestle with moments of low self-esteem and periods of depression or anxiety.  I still try to find ways of better managing stressful phases of life and better coping when life gets particularly tough.

But cigarettes never come into the equation.  Somewhere along the way, they simply stopped being something that I ever thought about or craved.  

They are only ever featured in the occasional rare dream or when looking at old photographs.  In those moments, it's often like looking at another person.

I was prescribed a medication called Wellbutrin in the beginning of March. The doctor did tell me that Wellbutrin is marketed under a different name as a medication to help quit smoking. I just started smoking less and less without really noticing during that first week or so of being prescribed the Wellbutrin. Once I realized I was barely smoking any cigarettes I decided to make a conscience effort to stop. I had some nicotine gum from a previous time I had tried to quit smoking. I’ve been chewing the gum since mid March and have slowly been chewing less and less of the nicotine gum.

Everyone who knew I had quit was listing lots of benefits of quitting. Telling me stories about how when their aunt Jeanie quit in 2013 she realized how she was severely over seasoning everything she cooked and that’s why no one ever ate her cooking. Now she was able to taste everything so much better. Similar stories of people’s sense of smell greatly improving after quitting smoking. I remember in health class in school they would show us the improvements that happen to the body after 1 hour with no cigarettes vs 1 day vs 1 month with no cigarettes... so on and so fourth.

I don’t know, I was just expecting a dramatic night and day difference I guess. Then when that didn’t happen I thought “okay give it some time! You have over a decade of damage your body is trying to heal itself from!” The thing is, I do see the benefits of not smoking. I never realized how bad it made me smell. I always thought a piece of mint gum and dousing myself in body spray made the smoke smell go away. I just really was expecting more of an improvement. Maybe someone else can relate or help me.

It’s bad because I am so determined to never smoke again in my life!! And I didn’t remember cigarettes anymore!

I went out for coffee, saw friends, came home, ate lunch and didn’t really struggle with the craving. When it came, I gave myself a nicotine hit from the spray thingy I got and went about my business. 

The afternoon was difficult. I went to the supermarket for some grocery shopping,  and as I was leaving, I decided to  line up for a pack of cigarettes.  I convinced myself that maybe I should have an emergency pack at home for those times when I just couldn’t handle it anymore. But I didn’t. I took a deep breath and thought to myself, “it’s just the craving, it will go away, just get out of here now”. And so I did. 

I got home, put on a nicotine patch and took the dog for a walk in the botanical gardens. Walking my puppy always requires a great deal of attention as she can be quite unpredictable, and the last thing I needed was some Karen lecturing me about how my dog needs training (she does and I’m aware, but who’s got the time?) Fortunately there were no Karens in the park, my attention was directed solely onto this one activity and I didn’t get triggered. 

I’ve also resumed my beginners Youtube yoga lessons which I’d dropped after two lessons because... well, it’s yoga. Despite my aversion to it, I did find it helped with the craving. Paying attention to my body and how my breathing has improved after just a day gave me the motivation I needed to stay strong. I might go back to the gym soon, but I’m not ready to make such a commitment just yet. 

The evening has gone well so far.  I’m feeling a bit tempted to have a glass of wine. Wine and tobacco are a combo made in heaven, so I’d better not. 

There’s a pool party tomorrow which I really wanna go to. There will be smokers there and I’m not feeling too confident about it. Drinking might also be a trigger. I’m yet to decide whether I’ll come. According to some other quitters on Reddit, I shouldn’t. I’ve also been advised to remind myself of a quitter’s golden rule: “not another puff, no matter what”.

I've tried everything to quit smoking. And I can tell you for sure after the first few times, quitting isn't as terrifying because I know I'm not gonna die. Smoking tricks you into subconsciously believing you will die without cigarettes. I've tried cold turkey, cutting back, gum, patches, Chantix, hypnosis...you name it. Most recently I did Quitsure which is interesting and probably very helpful, but I dont believe you have to do that and that only. I did everything they said, I reached out for help, I reread everything I was supposed to, but the cravings were still there and worse, I was falling into a big, unmotivated mess of depression. And I'm a very active person.

So I'm using the patch. Because I always had the most success with the patch. And with the brainwashing techniques of Quitsure, and the physical help with the patch and also I am taking Welbutrin for the compulsion aspect, this feels real. It's been 3 weeks. I had a rough patch (haha) a couple of days ago because I'd decided to not use the patch with quitsure, but I swallowed my pride and put the patch back on. I feel like a nonsmoker. I know I will never breathe that crap into my lungs again and now I just have to mitigate 40 yrs of addiction. 

So don't despair if it takes many attempts. It took me so long because I allowed myself to feel like a failure and not even try again for 10 yrs. The last two yrs I've kept quitting until I've hit this spot of KNOWING. It doesn't have to take so long.

My mom's older brother passed away a few days ago from complications due to the fast spreading small cell cancer. He was a smoker all his life and switched to Juul after being diagnosed with COPD. He was always appreciative of my quitting smoking cold turkey but some how could not get himself to do the same. I was in the hospital watching him with all those tubes, needles etc. after his very first chemo session in the first week of April, and am very glad that I could quit eight years ago.

Some details about the form of cancer he had:

Small-cell carcinoma is a fast-growing type of lung cancer commonly caused by smoking.

This aggressive form of lung cancer most commonly occurs in smokers. It usually starts in the breathing tubes (bronchi) and grows very quickly, creating large tumors and spreading (metastasizing) throughout the body.

There are about 200,000 US cases per year and the switch to e-cigarettes possibly worsened his COPD.

Request that all of you chugging on the cancer sticks should see and read the articles fully to comprehend the devastating effects.

https://www.healthline.com/health/lung-cancer-small-cell

Definitely a wake up call if there are any smokers amongst us (including the circle of extended family & friends)

I’ve been playing it as I fall asleep each night, and it really changes your whole mindset, and I don’t get the morning withdrawals anymore. It’ll get shittier throughout the rest of day, but if you focus on the key points in the video and remember why you’re quitting, it gets better.

I started when I joined the Army Cadets. It got heavier when I joined the Army proper - roll ups and cigarettes. 20 a day, no matter the cost. In the house, in the car.

I would sneak out at family events and dinners. I would pop outside the pub during nights out. Half my young club-based memories are from the smoking area.

But last month, my wife found out she was pregnant. She stopped smoking there and then - 4 weeks and counting for her. I tried at the same time, but my sour mood and the sudden, unprepared stop just became unmanageable with our mood swings - we argued a lot. So I caved and for the last month I have smoked outside the house, smoked while she was at work.

When I do, she can't stand to be around me for the smell. I understand that fully, but I hated having to be apart from her. Yesterday we had our first appointment with the midwife and  it really hit home that I need to give up sooner rather than kicking this can down the road any further.

I've done it before - quit cold turkey for 6 months shortly after leaving the Army when it was a choice of smoking or eating (I was simply that poor at the time). So if I can do it then, I can do it now.

1) Once you tell people, they’ll hold you accountable, and I do need you to help me stay on track. — 2) I want to help other people like me, who think they can’t do it, to quit this nasty habit. I’m not sure I can, but I guess we can all try together. 

My friends and partner have, for years now, incessantly nagged (though they’d prefer the word ‘warned’) me about all the harm smoking can cause to your breathing, taste buds, digestive system and overall health, but in all honesty, I just enjoy smoking too much to care about any of that (sorry, I know it sounds insensitive); it is the money that has made me want to stop. 

I’ve realized that my savings are dismally small and that I won’t be able to go anywhere, see anyone, or build anything for myself if I don’t do something about it. I’m done living from payday to payday. 

For my mission, I’ve equipped myself with the best stop-smoking aids I could find at the chemist, and I’m ready to give this a serious try. I know it won’t be easy, but so many people I know have managed to quit that I’m confident I can do it too. Or at least try. 

In case you’re wondering how I’m feeling, day 1 was hard. I found myself contemplating the idea of driving to the closest Coles Express a few times today to get a pack of the cheapest (and shittiest) ciggies they have and just stop with this quitting nonsense. But so far I’ve controlled myself. Talked myself out of trying to rationalize it (“What’s $40 more? You’ve spent so much already!) 

Cravings come and go. I drink some water, read a bit, play with the dog and try to redirect my attention to something else when the urge hits. Right now, as I write this post, I’m feeling a bit jittery. 

But I’m also feeling proud of my decision and my first step towards living a healthier life (both physically and financially).   So bear with me for the next few weeks. I’ll probably write a bit more about it and this experience unfolds.

• What country are you in? 

• age group ( decade) 

• Did you accept or deny that smoking had health effects on yourself? 

• Did you use the 'personal freedom\*' argument to justify your own smoking?

• Did you accept or deny that smoking had negative impacts on other people - either health or just smell/pollution/annoyance?

• How would the personal freedom argument apply to other people affected by the smoke?

• If you smoked in an open (public) area such as the street or open-air section of a restaurant what was your attitude to the effect of the smoke on passers-by or other people around you? Were you unaware, aware + shrug, aware + feeling a bit guilty? 

• Would you stop smoking in a public place (where it is permitted) if a stranger asked you to stop?
