I read that book all day today. I have to say my mind has been blown. I have been smoking since 13 years old. 17 years. I am up to about a pack and a half a day. Today is the day I stop.

&#x200B;

This post is mainly for myself, I will be providing updates to it with milestones as I go forward. But if others see it and it encourages them as well all the better.

Edit 1: 5/4/2020: 4 days down. Have had a very good amount of cravings but so far so good. I started limited my beer intake, that's when they get bad. Going outside for 6minute spurts to simulate going outside for a smoke seemed to help. I will say, I have definitely noticed an improved already with my chest/breathing/sleep habits. Sex has been way better as well. I wander around aimlessly at times when I would normally be smoking. Still not sure what to do about that one. So far though I am loving it.

Edit 2; 6 Days down. Had a night of heavy drinking around smokers last night. Surprisingly did not ask for one nor want one. I've never made it this far before without saying I've quit but actually sneaking a couple in when I'm by myself. The change is real.

Edit 3: 3 weeks and 4 days down. Still going strong, the urge comes around a little bit but for the most part I've kicked it. Now I look at other smokers with a little pity. I'm not gonna lie there are still some times I think about it, but I realize it does nothing for me and would regret it immediately. Saving tons of $$ as well. Sex is better, I feel like I am in better shape, and my skin has started to look better weirdly. OH! I DONT WAKE UP WITH SNOT AND FLEM IN THE BACK OF MY THROAT! ITS GREAT!

I recently talked with a friend who is becoming a neuroscientist studying addiction. Thety said what worked for them and friends of theirs in several 12 step programs was Chantix. After the 2 month regimen both physical and psychological cravings disappeared for the long term. They said that this rx also helps curb the physical withdrawal symptoms.

Has anyone out there tried Chantix and if so, how'd it go? Have you wanted nicotine since then?? Thanks for sharing your stories! I continually get empowered by hearing from others on this journey. 

P.S. I was never a regular cig smoker, I've picked it up on and off socially for about 10 years. Last few years been juuling and lately with this pandemic got very stressed and became more heavily involved with juul. I'm SOOOOO ready to be done with this for my heart/lung function and my own piece of mind!

But then it hit me, i used to be a smoker too! I smoked around 10 cigarettes per day for about 8 years, so a huge chunk of my life. And yet now it seems like it never happened. 

I quit smoking cold turkey 74 days ago, after another failed attempt in january. What was different this time? Well, the beginning was rough, and my anxiety was through the roof, i couldn't sleep, i was bingeing on food. This sub was of great help during this time, thanks to everyone who shared their wisdom here throughout the years!

However, the weirdest experience i had was the complete lack of cravings, and i think my mindset shift had a big influence in that. You see, i used to identify as a smoker. I wasn't able to drink any warm beverage, to speak on the phone or to start anything productive without a smoke. I was addicted because smoking was the only time i was fully invested in the moment and focused on my breathing. What i needed was not a cigarette, but living in the present, being grounded and mindful. I needed to remind myself to take deep breaths. These changes made quitting smoking so easy, i almost forgot i was ever a smoker. Which is not what i want, i want to be proud of this accomplishment and remind myself in tough times that if i did this, i can do anything. Good luck to everyone!",3,0

27,2020-04-29 10:32:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/gaajq6/day_366/,Day 366,"15 years of smoking. I had identified as a smoker my entire adult life.  Losing my identity was one of the scariest aspects in the contemplation of quitting, and one of the many misconceptions. 

I hit my one year mark yesterday as an ex-smoker. 364 days ago I was struggling hard to sustain my goal which was only to stop smoking for 30 days. This was an experiment to see if life did in fact become better without cigarettes.  

I was really losing it on day 2. I was useless at work; sweating, earaches, headaches, shakes. The research I did prior to quitting about nicotine withdrawal made me hyper aware of the symptoms and therefore amplified them tremendously.  The app I was using for support (Quit Smoking) encouraged me to check out this reddit page. It was here where I leaned (after scrolling through dozens and dozens of posts) about the book The Easy Way. I immediately picked up a copy at my local book store and after just two days of reading the book and highlighting the sticking points, I decided I would never smoke again. There were some challenging times that followed so I reverted to my highlights for reassurance that smoking was not the right answer. And I still have moments of reminiscing about how good a smoke would be in a given moment, but it‚Äôs so easy to remind myself that there‚Äôs no such thing as a single cigarette. Temptation elimination becomes so easy, it‚Äôs true.

To those just beginning your journey, I encourage you to read the book, download the app, and check back here frequently for motivating stories. It can be done! And confirmed: life is better without cigarettes. I have more confidence, I can enjoy people‚Äôs company, I can commit to events without worrying about smoking inhibitions, I have more money, I‚Äôm overall healthier since the onset of quitting naturally drove me to pursue other health goals. And I still have the better part of my identity. Good luck and keep going!",32,0

The best way I have found to do it is to liken it to hunger or thirst. It's like you have created this third thing in your body that you need to satisfy.

It's part of why quitting is so bad. Craving is like being hungry or thirsty and not being allowed to satisfy your hunger or quench your thirst. It is extremely uncomfortable but not painful in the typical sense.

 Obviously I'm speaking in normal terms for the average person who is feeling hungry after like, missing a lunch. I'm not trying to compare quitting smoking to people who are legitimately starving to death or anything. I just find the concept of a 3rd 'basic need' to be the easiest way to get non-smokers to grasp what quitting is like, or to understand why smokers continue their habit. We call it ""feeding"" an addiction for a reason.

Anyhoo I've been smoke free for almost 6 weeks now! I'm a little chubbier thanks to snacking and lockdown, but other things like noticeably better skin are making up for it. It's my third time seriously trying to quit. 

Good luck fellow nicotine addicts",6,1

I recently quit smoking cigarettes on April 18th (right at midnight) as that was my planned ""quitting day"".  
I smoked cigarettes for approximately 11 years (I am 30 right now, started when I was 19). I would smoke about a pack a day (15 - 20 cigs). I am also diagnosed with Asthma (I'm such an idiot, right?) and manage it with a long term inhaler and a rescue inhaler.

I am also a cannabis smoker. I use a water pipe in hopes it will cut back on tar (it's still smoke and shouldn't be in your lungs but cannabis has been very very very good to me for my Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and 'thought-loops' i get stuck in as a result).

My situation is that I am using a 4 mg Nicorette gum and hit my bong maybe 4 or 5 times a day (I pace myself and just take a hit and move along...then come back later and hit from the same bowl).

I am experiencing serious breathing weirdness. I know my oxygen level is fine but I find myself needing to take extraneous deep breaths. Then I feel like I'm breathing too much and it starts getting worse. No wheezing or anything, just this sensation that I am about to start suffocating.

Because of this I am trying to not smoke as much cannabis now, either, which is also making me a little uneasy and anxious. I walk around ALL DAY grabbing at my sternum or right under my rib cage and feel like I need to take deep breaths.

It's the worst when I'm sitting. When I'm standing it seems to get a lot better.

Is this common among quitting smoking? It's really crescendo-ed each day until now (the 28th).

I also started running to help build strength in my lungs (treadmill). 

This is to the point it's become a distraction. I am a software developer and it's extremely difficult to concentrate right now.  


My medications for my obsessive compulsive disorder are:

Prozac 20mg

Effexor 150 mg

Clonazapam .5 mg as needed daily - these seem to help when I take 1mg so I'm wondering if this is all stress and anxiety induced?

I just need some words of encouragement. How do you keep your eyes on the long term benefits instead of running to satisfy the short term urges?",2,3

54,2020-04-28 15:05:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/g9tblf/two_weeks_without_nicotine_today/,Two Weeks without Nicotine Today,"Four years ago, I was a regular smoker. Chain-smoking was prevalent on my college campus so I always had a group of people at night to mingle with after studying to smoke a Marlboro Red or two before retreating to my dorm room to go to bed. It quickly became the worst habit I've ever picked up.

Then the Juul caught on. I bought one and decided to make the switch because I was sick of constantly smelling like cigs, I'm very particular about smells, especially around non-smoking family/friends. Two glorious years with my trusty Juul and my unlimited supply of Mint pods went by, and all of a sudden we were hit with the flavor ban. I saw pods in my area go from $13, to 16, to 18.50, and finally to 20 flat, before being taken off shelves completely. I decided to give up the Juul and see how long I could quit cold turkey, I thought about how my money could be better used somewhere else, but that's not how addiction worked for me, so it never worked out. I tried other things on the market. Suorins, CaliBurn, PuffBars, Buzzbars, and Smoks. Even through my ""switch"" to electronic cigarettes I still would always keep a secret stash of cigs on hand for social events and the occasional late night post-studying heater.

In the beginning of 2020, I cut off my use of disposables. The wrappers and boxes littered all over my city are fucking horrendous. These things don't seem to be regulated, they have soaked cotton on the inside instead of a juice+wick pod system, there's way more flavors of these than there ever were of Juul Pods (I get someone has to take the blame for the flavors, Juul is the easiest target). But all in all, I always asked myself ""why the hell are *these* allowed? what are they doing to my body?""

Then, after COVID swept the country and news cycles, I finally began to feel concerned about my health for the first time in a long time. I felt like my lung capacity had decreased over the years, I felt winded when I walked up the stairs to my place, I would get occasional chest pain, I realized how horrifying the intense cravings for nicotine were and how debilitated I would feel when I didn't have a cig or some form of nicotine on me for longer than a few hours.

I lurked on this sub-reddit for a long time. Then, in the middle of the night, I pulled the trigger. I threw away my stash of cigs, I ran my electronics under water and threw them away. I felt ready for the withdrawals and to see the light at the other side.

The first 7 days were hell. I got nothing done, I felt sick. I felt angry, depressed, and hopeless. I couldn't eat, or sleep. I went to see my family (who don't know about any of this) to get away and get a distraction. Then, after day 14, things began to finally turn around. I woke up without cravings for nicotine, I'm working on replacing the oral fixation with obsessively making the best cup of coffee or tea that I can, and I feel myself breathing easier. The app ""Escape the Vape"" has helped tremendously throughout the process, reminding me how much money i'm saving, and how my body is now healing as a response to being without nicotine.

To anyone out there who feels like they can't quit and doesn't trust themselves to stay off. I was in your shoes two weeks ago. It's not going to be easy to get your brain to move past a dependency. But once you take the leap and get after it with everything you got, it only gets easier and easier, and you can feel your body begin to thank you. Even though it's been only two weeks for me. With all the withdrawals and mental headaches I experienced, I can't go through it again. I'm done forever.

Where I am at: 

I started smoking almost 2 years ago, I was dating a guy who was a chronic weed user, and chain smoked. Figured I‚Äôd give it a go, before I knew it I was buying my own packets and went from every now and again to 12-15 a day

I never imagined myself as a smoker, just never saw myself living that way. The guy and I broke up and smoking is the last piece that‚Äôs a remember of that awful relationship.

I‚Äôve gotten through half of Alan Carr‚Äôs easy way, and intend to finish. I stopped reading because the closer I got to the end the less I felt ready to quit. 

My mother and I typically bond over a cigarette after work, we talk about or days, we play Pok√©mon go, and everything is fine, but deep down I still have that little voice in my head telling me I need to stop 

I‚Äôm now dating an incredible man who would never ask me to quit but I know it bothers him, and I finally came to the decision now is as good a time as any to quit.

Just writing some of this out because the last few days have been just weird, and I'm unsure if it's my brain throwing fits for nicotine (because the thoughts to try it as a remedy have crossed my mind, but I'm not about to give in now) or if it's just the looming uncertainty that we have all been faced with since early this year. 

Picked up this bad habit at 18. Fresh in college, girlfriend dumped me for no great reasons, and I bummed a smoke from a friend in another friends backyard. I would eventually quit for a few to several months when I was 20ish, but since it wasn't a conscious quit I was back in it by the time I was hitting the bars around my university at 21. 

I switched to mainly vaping around 25/26. Previously I had been a pack a day smoker, and after doing the math now, I never really slowed my nicotine intake when I made that switch. Shit, I might have even upped it. I was vaping as much as a pack a day in nicotine equivalence, and I was supplementing with cigarettes when friends would offer (which wasn't exactly sparingly).

We got the Rona scare, and I decided enough was enough. I had already failed myself in my planned goal of quitting once I hit 25, but I wasnt about to let the fact that I inhale toxins be the deciding factor in my fight against such a questionable new virus.  

Day 1 wasn't the worst, but days 3-5 were pretty nutty. Somewhere in there I was basically just laying on my floor in front of a space heater for most of the day. Felt like I was dying and decided to just die on the floor, fuck it (set a timer on the heater to not burn the building down lol). I have never been an anxious person, but anxiety hit me like a sack of metal lead bricks right in the chest as soon as I realized I wasnt going to have anymore nicotine. 

Weeks 2-3 were pretty insignificant. I felt more normal even though the cravings still existed. This 4th weeks has been a bitch tho. I've been in basic isolation, so I'm 99% sure none of what I'm experiencing is Covid, but it's just insane to be feeling so weird again. My stomach doesnt want to eat as much as it normally does, my slight chest pain comes and goes, I don't have a persistent cough like I did when I first quit/also when I first switched to vaping, but I do cough some crap up every now and again. Sleeping is still rough unless I'm dog tired, but sleeping has always been a bit of an issue for me. I've always been a vivid dreamer, but now all of my dreams seem to involve some form of nicotine or sickness and it's not fun. Like last night I had a dream about people in a grocery store I have never been to yelling at me for not wearing a mask. Which in real life, I keep a mask in my backpack these days whenever I'm out in my car just in case. Just real weird shit for what I thought I'd be feeling while rounding off my first month. 

I'll try not to make this any longer, for anyone who's actually read this far. Hope everyone else is doing great with their quits, this sub has definitely helped me through some trying moments during my own. Hopefully I'll be able to make a post in a month or two about how this was just another low point like in my first week.

The advice and encouragement on my last post was definitely helpful. I've got the app now, some NRT gum, a list of motivations, etc. I was doing well during my original quit... And then I messed up. My initial mindset was, if I just ignored anything related to cigarettes, I would be able to forget about them... And that sort of worked until I was offered one and didn't even hesitate to smoke it. I am unfortunately going to have to get accustomed to smokers and somehow find a way to accept that I'm not one anymore.

I've just ordered step one patches, as I've never used patches before, I have questions. So if anyone here can answer them or point me in the right direction, it would be much appreciated.

1. Will I still continue to smoke when starting patches?

2. I enjoy the occasional beer or dram of whiskey, will drinking with the patches cause any unwanted side effects?

3. In past attempts, I went through wild mood swings for the first 2-3 weeks, will this happen with the patch?

4. Is the 10 week program described by nicoderm efficient/accurate or does the length of steps vary person to person? 

5. I hope you'll all accept me here, as a good majority of people in my life are smokers, and I expect the ""good for yous"", but I don't expect much support outside that.

Edit: follow up question out of curiosity. Why was I able to find 2 week kits for 40$ but 3 week kits are 85?",5,1

I have smoked more than 40 years, with an average of a pack  a day. Over these years I have stopped many dozens of times, with an average time of not smoking of about 1 month. Right now I haven't smoked for two weeks. 

Where others experience the withdrawal as difficult, I find it very pleasurable. During the first weeks of quitting I find myself in a state of euphoria, feeling deeply alive. Music, the sight of a bird, a poem, the pain I see in others, the realisation of how much I love and appreciate life, it all easily brings tears to my eyes, so touched do I feel by it all.
I think it is similar to bipolars who stop with their lithium.

 Where in the past this feeling of euphoria would be edgy, and easily turn into irritation and anger, since I'm aware of this, it doesn't happen anymore and I just feel deeply alive.

However, after a week or three, this euphoria starts to disappear and I just feel my old self again, which also diminishes my motivation to stop, and a new cycle of starting and quitting begins.

Can anyone relate to this?",8,0

I went through it in about less than a day. I was hooked and I think it absolutely helpful for someone who wants to stop smoking.

The main strong point of the book, I think, is that it shows exactly how the nicotine and cigarettes act on your body and your mind, giving you the tools to defend yourself from the monster attack. I think his work has been extremely beneficial for smokers, and he really deserves a thank, but I would like to point out a few pitfalls I noticed in his method.

First, I think that the book works as a push in the right direction but you need to be already convinced of what you want to do. It's like when you are on the border of a swimming pool, but you are scared to jump. The book works like the person who pushes you to enter the water. Basically it's no magic formula, it is just a clear explanation of why we are tricked into thinking that smoking is good. And I completely agree with him on everything he says.

Secondly, he states that the Will power method has no effect, while I disagree. I found myself struggling with withdrawal symptoms since I stopped smoking (just 2 days ago), and although I remind myself of all the reasons I don't have to fall for the nicotine trap, it still requires a lot of self-control and willpower not to smoke. I am convinced of what he states in the book, but that doesn't make quitting less hard, as I used my body to smoking for ten years and it's no easy task to change a habit that is so radicated. What I found the book did to me is that I am more motivated to accept the suffering to achieve freedom.

Did you guys read the book? What are your thoughts on it?

I already feel my health progressively getting better : 24 hours in and I can breathe better, 48 hours in with nicotine flushed away so I have an improved sense of smell and taste, &amp; now at over 72 hours in, I feel more energy. How can I let my progress slip away? I look back at all the trouble smoking has caused me. It has been one of the largest inhibitors in the progression of my life towards success. I will never go back to the old days. I will not let myself fail, I will not relapse, I will keep persevering.

Not sure what to do.,"I don‚Äôt have any major cravings, but my days seem kind of dull lately. It‚Äôs not really a lockdown thing, I‚Äôm pretty sure a large part of it is about missing smoking. I haven‚Äôt been sitting around at home the past few days and have been around friends, so it‚Äôs not isolation. Right now I‚Äôm sitting outside on a bench, enjoying the spring weather, which would be a moment when I‚Äôd usually love a cigarette (or a few of them) and started thinking about smoking again

One part of me is happy that I made the decision to quit, but another part of me regrets it. Quitting hasn‚Äôt been too hard, not even the first few days. On the one hand, that‚Äôs a good thing of course, because I was spared the worst part. On the other hand, it‚Äôs easier to throw it away again because while it was uncomfortable, I‚Äôm not exactly scared to go through this again.

Many people say that to successfully quit, you have to be able to tell yourself that you will never smoke again and believe it. I don‚Äôt feel like I can say that with certainty. I didn‚Äôt even really plan to quit, it was just a spontaneous decision. So currently I‚Äôm not a non-smoker, I‚Äôm a smoker who doesn‚Äôt smoke. I fear that unless I get to the point where I believe I will never smoke again, I‚Äôll just stay that way and while I‚Äôll think of it less often, the longing will not really go away and that‚Äôs a pretty sad thought.

This makes me it think that maybe I should start again and get ready to quit by smoking mindfully for a while, but I realize of course that a large part of this idea is the addiction talking.

I have read Allen Carr and while I see how that book can be a great help to many people, the ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt really enjoy smoking‚Äù arguments didn‚Äôt fully resonate with me - or they did at first, but then I started (over)analyzing them. Enjoyment, as I see it, is completely subjective and even something that is bad for you and hijacks your dopamine system can be subjectively enjoyable. 

Not sure what to do here. Just waiting it out is an option of course, but if not much changes, what would you do? Did you feel anything similar at some point in your quit?",7,1

Today is my first 24 hours smoke-free! 

After a three day at-home silent meditation, I started really paying attention to my need to smoke (always spliffs/about 60/40). Instead of judging myself for it and whatnot, I just started writing down what made me want to smoke, what I thought about while I was smoking, and how I had felt. Well, as you can imagine, that got really annoying really fast.

So, I just quit.

It seemed silly to smoke when I had all this free time to learn new skills, learn a language, pick up running, hell, I could just sleep all day if I wanted to. (Unemployed to COVID19). I just needed to get past that fear of the uncertain, my fear of failing, or the pain I might go through. 

Anywho, it seems that tobacco finally started interfering enough with my life (disrupting my good habits, an emotional crutch, got in the way of my relationship, etc) where the pain of NOT quitting was overrode by the pain of quitting. 

Honestly, I've been needing this perspective shift for so long now. I am excited to travel down the path of smoke-free and see what other things come my way. Weed will be a different path all together, but for now, I start with tobacco!

I want to remember that I CAN do whats hard.

I CAN push past what makes me scared and uncomfortable. 

Rant, over.

Just wanted to share my excitement and my new journey down the smoke-free life!",15,1

I was an addict. Started when j was 13 got serious by the time I was 16. Upwards of 10 a day since I was 17 and now I'm almost 24. Last 5 years it's been closer to 15 a day, upwards of 20 when I'm drinking. I'm in the midst of quitting right now (couple weeks in) and I really really miss it and I wonder if I could smoke a casual smoke on the weekends or with college buddies when I see them. I would impose rules such as never purchasing smokes for myself and smoking only if I was offered but I dunno how realistic such ambitions are. I've a feeling id just relapse into smoking like the fiend I used to be. In your experiences, have you been able to keep it casual?

I have not relapsed on smoking yet, but have started consuming wine. I've been drinking at least two glasses daily - for the past month. My choice is mainly red, between my end of work (from home) hours and before sleep. I live alone, so isolation might have something to do with it.

I jokingly said, ""or we could just quit, haha.""

She paused, and immediately slammed the keys on the counter, opened a drawer, ruffled through it, pulled out nicorette gum and slapped on a nicotine patch.

""Ok then."" She looks at me like she's just killed and buried someone. So determined. 

""What have I done"" I thought. It all happened so fast. Just like that? Just like that we're not smokers anymore? That's... all it took? It seemed so far away a second ago. Years away. It's just a choice in the end. I can chose to just... not.

168,2020-04-25 00:43:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/g7nmvv/this_is_what_helped_me/,This is what helped me,"Hello everyone,

I hope you are all doing well. I have just discovered this subreddit and wanted to share a list I compiled that helped me overcome the nasty habit. I apologise for any mistakes in advance as English is not my first language. Now I was what you call a passionate smoker,of course we are all different and some of these things might not apply to everyone but I think in general the list is useful.

1. **You will never beat your surroundings**

What does that even mean? It means it is naive to think you will be able to be around your friends who smoke. You wont be able to get drunk and withstand the urge for cigarette.For the first 3 months you will have to avoid situations in which there is a possibility for you to smoke because sooner or later your willpower will be depleted.

2) **First 3-7 days are physical,the rest is psychological**

Seriously,the first week is horrible. You will want to sell your soul to the devil for just one puff. Ok,ok I might have exaggerated a bit but it will be very hard. After that it will be easier,much easier,in fact so much easier that you will think that you already won and the danger is gone. But when that happens you have already lost. Because this enemy is a sneaky,sneaky shit, the biggest asshole you have ever faced. It will patiently wait for its opportunity,a moment in which you have lowered your guard and then it will knock you out. When life gets hard and you are faced with many problems it will creep up on you and whisper to your ear: ""I'm here. I know its hard and I'm here for you.""

3) **Cigarette is your best friend**

Now you are exaggerating again. But I'm not. Think about it, you have developed thousands of little routines that are centered around smoking. Morning coffee,late night beer,after a meal,driving,endless smoke breaks from work, happiness,sadness,boredom,stress were all accompanied by a cigarette. Do you really think you wont miss it? It is crucial to be conscious about these cues and develop a strategy of coping with them when they inevitably happen. Always remember,you have a toxic friend,literally.

4) **Goodbye forever**

This one doesnt translate well. In my country we say ""Zbogom"" when you are leaving someone forever, and ""Dovidenja"" when you will eventually see them again. This is ""Zbogom"". If you really want to quit you will have to make peace with the fact that it is forever. In your journey you will undoubtedly find yourself thinking ""I might smoke just this one cigarette,no biggie"", but then that one turns into ""Just this pack and I'm done"" and you end up repeating that every other day. Trust me, every next attempt at quitting is going to be more and more difficult. Lots of people convince themselves that if they were sucessful once they will be again but later they can't imagine their life without cigarettes.

5) **Once a smoker,always a smoker**

Why do people who were once smokers become the biggest opponents of smoking? Because they are aware of the fact that they only need a moment to fall back into the arms of their best friend. Even if you haven't smoked for years, you might see someone smoking and feel the urge for that sweet,sweet cigarette. That urge never disappears,it only gets weaker and weaker. Once a smoker,always a smoker.

**6) Vivid dreams**

Yes,you will have them.They will be intense. So much that you will wake up and be mad at yourself for caving after all this time.But dont worry,you havent.

7)**Dont count the days,hours,minutes**

That way you are subconsciously always thinking about cigarettes. You want the opposite,to think about them as little as possible. Remember, you have quit forever. You are not a smoker.

8) **Health is not a good reason**

""Because my grandpa smoked for 60 years and nothing happened to him""- or some other explanation a smoker will give you. If health was that important you wouldnt smoke. Unfortunately health is a good reason only when its too late. You will never stop if you still romanticize smoking or if you still like smoking. You have to be sick of them, you need to really want to stop.I cant stress this enough.

9)**Exercise**

Because you will get fat. The biggest compensation for lack of nicotine is excess of food. It is also a good coping mechanism, as you will be very cranky in the beginning.",20,0

My drugs and behavior class has taught me that overtime the reward of nicotine stops becoming the only factor in craving a cigarette as your brain rewires itself to associate certain actions and places with smoking. 

So I thought why not try and hijack that system for some good? Now, if I get a really intense craving, I start chugging water until I almost feel bloated and at that point I feel way too full to be thinking about a cigarette.

mainly i read that first three days are worse , mine were those okay . may be because i had more strength and a fresh mind to fight the cravings in start. now i had an assumption that physical cravings may slow down after three days and may not be that intense anymore . but as i quit cold turkey method and now i am on my 9th day i still get physical cravings very often . i have not started taking any substitutes like nicotine patches , nicotine gums, or anything generally considered non-addictive that i can take as placebo. 

one thing i did notice which helped me to get me this far is , whenever i get up after a sleep i dont feel cravings for about 3 to 4 hours , but as soon as i have eaten a meal , nicotine cravings gradually start .

i know this group is mainly for quiting smoking , but i just cud not find anywhere else related to quitting other forms of nicotine addiction, to put my thoughts . i just wanted to share what i feel like ryt now to someone who would understand the feeling .

I was smoking a pack a day for the past 4 years. Due to some familial pressure and health issues, i decided to get rid of it, once and for all. 

In order to explain my current condition, i have to tell you why I smoked. I am a fairly lousy sleeper and always had problems with maintaining a sleep schedule. Therefore, I would often smoke a cigarette or two after waking up, instead of coffee, to jolt me awake. Soon, I transitioned into a pack a day. The cigarette helped me to stay awake, as after smoking one, I would easily stay awake for 2-3 hours, even past my usual bed time.

Now, after one month, the cravings are under control, and my health has improved noticeably. However, I have that dull feeling, or lack of focus without the smoking. The kind of spacing out you get when you just wake up. I have a fairly low stake job right now, due to Corona Virus, however, it is affecting my job as I can't get focused or creative enough to work properly. I can work if I concentrate hard enough, but it annoys me, and my quality of work suffers. Quitting smoking is already hard enough, and this added pressure is no good.

I have visited this forum this past month countless times, and have always found good advice in the posts and comments. However I cant find anything related to my situation, and would love any help or advice you can give.

TL;DR - One month of quitting cold turkey and cannot get focused or creative without stimulus of a cigarette.",3,2

I decided to quit smoking after partying too hard. I'd been going hardcore drinking and chain-smoking for about two months and my body was not cooperating anymore. I slept for three days. When I woke up I couldn't keep anything down. I was feeling so sick whatever nicotine withdrawals I was having blended in with a general sickness. When I did think of having a cigarette it did not seem so appealing because I was so toxic. I had a cigarette and it gave me a big head spin.  I figured this would be as good a time as any to try quitting smoking. Gradually my hangover went away and I was left with just the nicotine withdrawals. It kinda helped me that I'd been so sick, because what I was feeling was still better than I was feeling before!

Having said that the nicotine withdrawal was nasty. Hot and cold flashes.  Drenching night-sweats. Phantom odors. Anxiety. This mind-stinging brain fog that was like being drunk without any buzz. This last one challenged my will more than anything. I felt stupid and I wanted my mind back.

But I soldiered through. Days 3 - 8 were the worst. The symptoms were nagging at me constantly. Sometimes more than others, but always there.

I got myself through by treating it like a medicine. Think of all those people who have cancer. If they can smile through chemotherapy, then I'm a pussy if I can't get through this.

After day 8 the withdraws started to abate roughly 10 % a day.  I'm on day 15 now.

Am I back to normal? I have no real frame of reference for 'normal' as I've been smoking for so long I don't really know how I'm supposed to feel as a non smoker? But I've definitely got lots of energy. I'm making plans,  thinking clearer. I have increased self worth for having accomplished something (although I know all that could be undone with a relapse). Every day seems better than the last.

I switched to 12mg freebase e-juice and smoke about 2 ml a day. I have so much restless energy it's just unberable...

My name is Karl, 54 yo, and I live in Seattle, Wa 

Ive been smoking for about 40 years now. I quit for 3 years until I went throught the stressfull events of my Mom passing away fromthe complications of a stroke in 2016. I seen my brother smoking a cigarette, and asked him for one.. BIG MISTAKE. Been smoking ever since. Im such a dumbass.

Iam a health conscientious type of guy, who takes vitamins, and lifts weights.... Not as much as i used to(when I stopped smoking) but I still pound that iron... And I wanna get back into lifting in a more serious fashion. I drink lots of water each and everyday, But my discipline is down the drain. I either go all the way, or I throw in the towel. 

I have a bad case of OCD, and I always wanna do things ""right""... and Im hard on myself when I fail.

I have had a failed relationship recently, and kinda getting back together with my ex. She knows me better than anyone, and she is my comfort zone. I realized the past dates Ive had was just rebound. Im working on myself in a big way, and I wanna improve myself in every way possible.

Anyways, I started an app on my iphone that tells me how long ive quit, and the money saved etc...

My blood pressure has gone up ever since I smoked again, and I blame it on stress, and nicotine, and weight gain.

Im going to beat this addiction this time, and I wont go back. Im getting older, and there is so much that I wanna achieve.

Im greatful we have this wonderful community here, and I will participate as much as possible.

Thank you for your time. Karl Lehmann. :)",24,0
216,2020-04-23 14:22:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/g6rvjs/dont_see_much_talk_here_about_what_quitting_does/,Don‚Äôt see much talk here about what quitting does for one‚Äôs daily bowel movements.,"Im talkin about taking a dump. Making brown. Dropping the kids off at the pool. Drivin out the prairie dogs. Drowning a baby otter...you get the point. 

I‚Äôm on day 6 or my current quit. This is the 3rd time in 2 years that I‚Äôve made it past 24 hours in my quit. Anyone who‚Äôs gotten to day 2 and 3 knows they can be the worst. Insomnia, irritability, huge hormonal swings, and constipation. 

When smoking it was never a question of whether or not you were going to be dropping a #2 before your morning shower. Wake up, make that coffee, light that first lung-dart of the day and before you can finish the death stick your bowels were begging to be freed from their prison. Never were those morning shits pretty, especially over time. The longer you smoked the more fucked up your digestive system became. Years and years of poison and stress pumped through your gut. 

As follows is what I‚Äôve experienced and what one might expect when quitting. Although, as with most things, it will vary from person to person. 

Day 1. Enter the quitting. I quit on a Friday evening. Waited till 11:50pm. That way I could say I quit  ‚Äòyesterday‚Äô upon waking 7 hours later. Plenty of nicotine in my system still, coffee still able to get things moving. Perfect. Feel crazy all day but at least I took a shit that morning. 

Day 2. Somehow still able to fire off a dirty brown, not first thing in the morning, more of a early afternoon situation. Need second shower. No problem. I‚Äôd attribute all the fucking snacking from the day before, filling my intestines with waste. The hunger without cigs is real. Whether it‚Äôs boredom or hormonal or lack of adding chemicals you‚Äôre gonna be hungrier than you‚Äôre used to. 

Day 3. Fuck day 3. Fuck everything about day 3. Last night you didn‚Äôt get much sleep. Tired as hell from hormonal up and downs of the previous day. Tired from cleaning and organizing things around the house, shit you didn‚Äôt even remember you had. Cause you gotta stay busy or you‚Äôre likely to cave and smoke out of sheer boredom. Exhausted yet unable to fall asleep. But you made it to day 3. Half awake and half dead, at least that‚Äôs how it feels. Coffee will do the trick. Except it only just barely wakes you up. And it doesn‚Äôt help you shit. Not at all. Did I say Fuck day 3 yet? 

Day 4. Still tired from waking up half dozen times last night but you‚Äôre feeling a little better somehow. Not as on edge. A little more clearheaded, in small spurts. But damn you‚Äôre still bloated as hell. Too much eating and not enough dookin. More coffee. Smoothie maybe. Salad. Greens. Fiber. Stomach hurts. Get. This. Turd. Outta me! And then it happens. For me it was 3pm and I was throwing the frisbee for my dog. Is this just another fart? I‚Äôll take whatever I can to get any relief from in my stomach. Nope, this is not a drill. It‚Äôs fucking on! 2.5 days worth of consuming all kinds of foods and cravings is unleashed into the bowl. Nothing has felt so good. You‚Äôre turds served their abnormally long sentence and are now free to swim the sewers. Thank god. Things are looking up. Couple hours later, more poo. And oh look, more movement. Not stoked on being stopped up, now not stoked on repeating trips to bathroom...that‚Äôs a lot of showers. Maybe just don‚Äôt shower till the end of day 4.

Now before we get to day 5 let‚Äôs touch on one thing. Hopefully you‚Äôre changing more in your life than just the smoking. When I started smoking I was still going to the gym 6 days a week, eating healthy as fuck, and was in really good shape. At that point I smoked maybe 6 cigs a day. Fast forward 5 years. A pack a day at minimum was being frantically gulped into my lungs. Workout? What the fuck is that? Salad? Nope, fuck off. Drinking water? How about coffee and soda, thanks. No energy for anything other that take out, frozen food, and cigarettes to pair with my booze. 

Day 5. Fucking beautiful glorious day 5! By now the cravings, for both cigarettes and the garbage food you‚Äôve grown accustomed to, have dropped dramatically. They are still there but you have 4 days under your belt and you‚Äôre on the right track. A salad for lunch. Broccoli with dinner. And you‚Äôve been drinking water throughout each day. You can‚Äôt get enough of that clear liquid. You forgot how the taste of nothing actually tasted so good. You wake up and instead of reaching for that pack of cowboy-killers you reach for that bottle of water you left on your nightstand. Fuckin parched from not being able to drink water while you slumbered. Which by the way, you only woke up 2 times last night so things are looking up. Go make coffee and read the news or check some stocks or play with the dog. Then it happens. Coffee does it‚Äôs thing and you‚Äôre about to do yours. One big push. Very little noise. No violent splatter. No swampy looking toilet bowl. Just a perfect soft serve chocolate snake, coiled round the bowl. 

What is this? How could this be? Stomach doesn‚Äôt hurt. Poop-shoot don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs on fire. The smell of small death isn‚Äôt lingering in the air. Seems so foreign. But then you remember this is how you used to shit. Normal. Healthy. Beautifully. 

There are many reasons to quit. Not dying is probably top. Not smelling like an ashtray. The return of smell and taste. Improved lung function. Boost in energy and stamina. Increased libido. These are all wonderful. But in my experience, one of the most beneficial and rewarding effects of quitting has been how wonderful my bowel movements have become. We spend a good amount of our lives in the bathroom. So when it comes to smoking: quit that shit so you can take normal shits. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got to say about that.",202,0

Again, sorry for the weird diary posting but I found reading others posts has helped me so I hope this helps someone else one day. 

I have been depressed as hell for a few days. Like...thinking life will always suck forever now. Which is weird because my depression is managed ok with meds. So, I had a moment of realization that it‚Äôs only feeling worse because I‚Äôm still romanticizing smoking. Life did not suddenly turn to shit, and it‚Äôs literally the same as it was 2 weeks ago - it‚Äôs just the nicotine demon telling me lies so I can have an excuse to smoke. 

So. Enough of that. I‚Äôm actively trying to stop my thinking when I catch myself. If I realize I‚Äôm picturing the ‚Äúgood time sitting outside soaking up the sun and solving life‚Äôs problems with a cigarette‚Äù, I stop. Instead, I think of the horrible smell, the worry that my apartment neighbours will complain to the strata, the standing in the freezing cold and not even wanting to finish a smoke but having to. 

And then it gets easier to not smoke. 

Also, I know ‚Äúroller blading is gay‚Äù (Aziz Ansari reference), but I actually bought some roller blades so I can go out each day with my partner. I can‚Äôt run because my lungs suck because I smoked, but blading is apparently great exercise and burns more calories anyways. So, positive changes coming! (If I can get over the roller blading embarrassment lol).

Boy am I glad I have got this far.

Some notes from my first month in almost 20 years completely nicotine free.

Cravings fall off a cliff at some point:
The first few days feel like one giant craving. Every thought seems to circle back to smoking and it can feel exhausting. I can't pinpoint when, but, at some point cravings become discernible, individual, and fleeting things. I stopped logging individual cravings in the app and would do it daily. The last week or so I actually struggle to honestly remember cravings by the end of the day.

I got really gassy/apparently I have a sweet tooth?
Two really different things, I know:
* I was not expecting this, but I got super gassy. It went away after like 10 or so days though.
* I've never been someone that gets frequent pangs for chocolates or other kinds of sweets but that has changed. I'm not allowing myself to give in to all these pangs though so as to avoid ballooning in size.

If you are reading this and you haven't stopped smoking yet, this is what I will say to you;
You absolutely can do this, no matter what reasons you have that are telling you you can't. Read some Allen Carr, read and talk to people in this sub, download the Smoke Free app. All of those things were vital tools to get me up to this point and I'll need them to keep going.

I will come offline from my friends a 10 or so just so i can have this session. In the day i feel awful, lethargic and absolutly angry at everything. The anger issues are causing a rift between me and my girl, who is completely unaware that i even smoke! Im spending 300 pounds  a month on smoking and i wasnt to quit more than i have ever wanted anything else in my life.

&#x200B;

So around a week ago i read Allen Carrs quit smoking book. Had this sudden ellation to quit... lasted one day. Gave it a few more go's over the course of last week and failed.. miserably. So here i am on the morning of Day 1, not feeling amazingly confident but with this absolute desire to quit. Please tell me its worth it? What i am afraid of is hearing stories about anxiety after a few weeks yet hear things like oh after three days it gets so much better? so much contradiction..

My boyfriend has been an avid cigarette smoker, turned vaper for countless years now, going on roughly 7-8 I believe.  He has tried quitting in the past multiple times, but last week he decided to go cold turkey to fully quit nicotine before we move in together (roughly in a month). 

I have tried my best to keep his spirits high and provide distractions, such as fun meals or distractions like video games. But with the stay at home order, I am no longer able to do this, at least for another week or so. 

I am curious if you guys have any ideas that I can use to encourage his fantastic habit of not smoking or ways to show how well he is doing. Maybe something that worked well for you while you were quitting, or something your s.o. did to help? 

Any advice or tips are appreciated :)  I am insanely proud of him for taking this step and from the previous times I have seen him try to quit, this time seems like it's going to stick!! I just want to make sure it does. 

Thanks so much!",1,0

I don't think I'm particularly heavily addicted to nicotine. But I must be because I've smoked on and off for nearly 30 years! Just not very much..
 
I never smoke indoors and I rarely smoke at home. But when I'm out in a club, if I've been drinking or I'm high, suddenly it's like GIVE ME ALL THE CIGARETTES..Then I can happily go without all through the week, barely a craving in sight. 

So. A month into lockdown, obviously a great time to quit. Stopped smoking again just over a month ago, and before that was getting through maybe a pack a fortnight at most, really not a heavy smoker. A social smoker, if you like. 

How do I stop myself going ""fuck it"" and having a cigarette when I'm out?? There must be some good strategies I can get stuck into before all the bars reopen... any thoughts?",1,1

I‚Äôm here to post to those having great success out there who may lose sight of things to come in the future, and to those who are trying and may get there one day. I stopped smoking when I was 23, cold turkey after smoking since I was 18. I switched to vaping from age 21-23. When I quit I threw my vape pen out the window. At the time I was using it very frequently, and smoked the more potent oil available for it at the time. The battery had broke, and I began to feel the anxiety that addicts typically feel whenever they know they won‚Äôt be able to catch a fix. 

At this point I had decided that I was tired of being a slave to this stupid chemical compound in a plant, and it was nonsense to let something like that have such a profound effect on my life and decisions. It was all fresh in my head, and it all made sense at the time. Why was I choosing to go smoke during coffee break instead of socializing and getting a snack when I‚Äôm hungry. Why did I have a drink and smoke instead of exercise. Why did I spend a small car payment per month buying something that was poison to me.

I was determined, and I was losing my mind but time went on and I battled each craving one at a time. Even over two months into having quit I would still catch myself on occasion reaching to my pocket to grab my pen when a craving hit out of habit. Time passed and passed, and to my own disbelief, eventually I didn‚Äôt crave anymore. Even when drinking, it all eventually went away too. 5 years had passed, I never even wanted one. I thought it was gross, and foolish. It was below me.

So here I am 5 years down the road, a bachelor again. I start drinking a bit more and hanging around bars/social scenes a bit more. Once in a while the smoke from people I was conversing with would come my way. I started to like the smell of it. Eventually the idea creeps into my head that ‚Äúmaybe you can just have a cigar. It‚Äôs not the same as smoking and it‚Äôll just be something to do on occasion.‚Äù So one night after drinking for a while I took the plunge and had a cigar, and a few weeks go by and I have another. Eventually I bum a smoke here or there, and two more months go by. I caved to my indulgences two weeks ago and bought a Juul pen. This one time allowance for myself has led me to here. 

Now I sit here, 36 hours into this entire withdrawal process again hoping that it‚Äôs easier to weather after a brief relapse rather than a 5 year binge, but I can tell you it is not any fun whatsoever starting this process over. If you have quit and time has went by, don‚Äôt be foolish enough to think things have changed and it won‚Äôt be so bad down the road. It will still grab ahold of you just like it did before. Always remember that when you‚Äôre successful. The worst trick is thinking you‚Äôve beat it and not still sticking to your rules you‚Äôve set for yourself.


Congrats to those doing well. Best of luck to those who struggle, and here‚Äôs to round two boys.

We're both chain smokers, we each smoke 20+ a day and we both have smoked for over 15 years. He has quit a couple of times, presumably cold turkey. I've only spent about a month not smoking about ten years ago. When I've tried to quit cold turkey I've had little breakdowns of sorts, or unexplainable sudden outbursts of a horrible temper. Today is our first day with a ""ration"" of 12, and he is already almost done with his (this at 2 PM). I'm already freaking out that I'm going to lose my nerve and lash out at him, and since he has this symptoms too, that this will become a shitshow.

I went through some posts here, but I didn't find anyone with an Olympic habit like we both have. I'm nervous thinking that if one of us relapses, it may decrease the other's chances too.

I didn't have much time to do a lot of research for this. Frankly it doesn't seem like we have great odds in our favor..

I've been irritable as fuck still, which is annoying. You ever get so cranky that you end up annoying yourself? Kinda like that. Except, I feel bad for being so cranky and I can't quite figure out how to handle it. So, I started looking at nicotine-free vapes. I feel like I just need a reason to go sit outside for 10 minutes, ""smoke"", and put my good attitude back on. It feels like cheating, but it's not nicotine, so I don't know. I think the only thing I'm worried about is actually starting smoking again. 

It's funny - I would die for a smoke, but I don't actually want to smoke because it smells terrible, it's embarrassing, and it makes life very inconvenient. But, I also can't stop thinking about wanting a smoke.

I began smoking at 19 years old. I knew it was bad for my health, that's always been common knowledge in my day and age... But I did it anyway. In a hectic time in life, it seemed worth the risks to get that headrush feeling.. And with the way my mental health was declining, taking years off my life seemed perfectly okay. Smoke breaks were an easy break from the world. 

I have ""quit"" before. From anywhere from a few days to almost a year. It is shockingly easy for me to have that one bad day where my mind goes to ""one more cigarette can't hurt.."" to ""...well since I've bought a whole pack, I might as well finish it..."" to ""damn they're gone... I want another."" And the cycle continues.

I am now 28 years old. For many years I have been a pack-a-day smoker and that has continued until recently...

I found out recently that I am pregnant. That meant no more smoking and I thought I was okay with that. Yet, I've had many ""last ones"" since. With as excited as I am to have this baby, there are brand new worries that I'm harboring. With the stay at home order, workplace shut down and so much time on my hands, I'm finding it so hard to get out of my head or to want to do anything besides smoke my troubles away. 

I feel horrible... I feel like a piece of shit.. and that self-loathing always leads me back to cigarettes... To doing the very thing that's making me hate myself. I don't understand the way my mind works or why this is so hard.. especially now that I have the very best reasons to stop.

* I wasn't feeling good in my body. I felt the wheezing, being out of breath. As someone who was physically fit for most of her life, this really bothered me.
* It was negatively affecting my professional life. Even if I did a great job, going for smoke breaks (and smelling like smoke) would invoke a sense of judgment from others and a bit of shame from myself. 
* Smoking wasn't fun anymore. I used to enjoy smoking after a coffee or a nice meal; maybe on a night out. Now I found myself predominantly smoking as a coping mechanism for my anxiety. It did not make me feel good. If anything, it heightened my anxiety. 
* COVID-19 pandemic made me focus on my health more than ever and pushed me to stop smoking. I'm heavily self-reliant and cannot afford to get sick so needed to minimize the risks out of pure necessity.

I smoked for 10 years before changing to ecigarette 5 years ago.

I lasted a week without nicotine eliquid, before I couldn't bear the restlessness anymore and vaped very little (0.5ml of 3mg). It easened the restlessness a lot so I decided to get nicotine patches.

The first 1-2 days were quite okay. My stomach started getting upset, but other than that it was bearable. Also I wake up every morning two times: at 5:30 and 7:00, and feel stressed out.

However, I also started getting mood changes, especially kind of sadness?

Today is so far the worst: My stomach is upset yet again, and I'm sleep deprived and feeling cold. 

Im using 15mg - 16 hrs patches. I didn't expect the withdrawal symptoms to stil hit so hard. Its better than without NRT, especially 3-5 hrs after applying the patch. Morning are especially bad. Getting anxious about the symptoms. In the evening I do 30 minutes of erging which helps a lot.

I still miss smoking, I miss the feeling of nicotine, I miss it as a coping mechanism, I miss it as a social activity. Most of our friends still smoke and it's hard for me to be around them and not feel ""left out"" 
somehow. 

Don't get me wrong, my higher self is glad that I stopped. I can breathe better, I am not constantly waiting for the next time I will be able to smoke, I am glad to not stink up my clothes and my house anymore. 

I guess what I'm looking for with this post it .. validation of some sort? I feel so bad that he was able to let go of this habit so much more quickly. I feel bad that I still think that my life would be better if I still smoked. I don't know how to get out of this thought circle, and I'm starting to grow resentful even.",5,0

I‚Äôm just worried about all the things that I relate smoking to. Sometimes when I‚Äôm in social situations like out for drinks with friends, it makes me feel more comfortable with people and I really enjoy it. I find it difficult to see a situation where I‚Äôm out and having a good time and not smoking. I know this is an association thing I‚Äôve done since I was a teenager but it‚Äôs really hard to see my life without it. 

I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôm going to struggle with my anxiety around friends without smoking. 

I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôm not going to be able to stop smoking. At the moment I‚Äôm back home and my whole family smokes. Often after tea we all go for a fag together and it‚Äôs quite nice in the evenings. I‚Äôm worried about how I‚Äôm going to handle that situation. 

I love going for coffee with friends and sitting outside with a cig and drinking a coffee with it. I honestly love it so much. I hate how much I love smoking. 

I really just wish I had never started smoking. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to quit but I know I‚Äôve got to.

I hope I / WE remain strong.,"I'm feeling very emotional today and although I cannot really seem to remember how a cigarette tastes anymore, I've caught myself thinking of smoking one for real. 

It's like my mind is telling me fuck it - fuck everything!

I know the benefits of being a non-smoker. I know ""not one puff, no matter what""... I know what I need to do in situations like these. I *know* all of these things and yet tonight I still caught myself thinking about throwing it all away because I *can*. It's like I want to ""punish"" myself by smoking one because I know it's going to hurt and disappoint me so much. Isn't it weird?

This is how I relapsed the last time. I had reached a point (a difficult time in my life) where I just felt like I wanted to take control of *something,* because it felt like I had no control of anything and so I took control of deciding whether I wanted to smoke again or not. Of course I now know that it was pointless and really stupid. 

Anyway...I am not going to smoke. But I needed to get that off my chest, write it down somewhere and acknowledge it.  I thought I was doing so well and then this. Being addicted to nicotine is a life long struggle and every now and then it really comes back hard.

I really hope I / WE remain strong.",19,0

It's my first time on the subreddit and I thought now would be the time to get off of all things nicotine and get help for the withdrawal anxiety. My boyfriend and I started smoking around 2 years ago and switched to vaping after realising how shitty we felt - haven't touched a cigarette in over 9 months.  Problem is we now vape heavily and both have stressful yet sedentary jobs/studies, so we often grab our vapes and pull at them without even thinking, so much so that it's pretty a near constant intake. We've cut down over a few months but still vaped way too much. I could definitely feel a dampness in my lungs which scared me.

South Africa was going to have a three week lockdown (including a strict ban on nicotine and alcohol sales). We stocked up for the three weeks but the lockdown has been extended to the beginning of May (so no nicotine products). Long story short, but we ran out of liquid the day before the lockdown would have ended. It's been 5 days without any nicotine and to be honest, I've realised that it's an accidental way to quit, but for the better.

I feel like I have to be the strong one here since he's been reacting badly to a lack of nicotine and even scratched through our house in hopes of finding a stray cigarette or an extra drop of liquid. We either both have to quit or both have to continue and that's what I want to talk to him about.

I feel so much better, but I do have a constant, underlying feeling that makes my brain feel like it's surging with a weird current  in waves as well as heart palpitations. My body and brain basically feel like they're doing the Mexican wave. But overall I feel like I can breathe better. I feel like I relied on vaping since I fidget so much and want something in my hand, but I've found some things to keep my hands occupied. I also feel like I have a responsibility towards preventing my grandfather from getting Corona (or anything lung related) since he's asthmatic and diabetic. Most importantly I'm only 23, in the medical field and I don't want to live my life relying on this crap. 

I know this subreddit is geared more towards cigarettes but I really don't think vaping is great for us either. Any tips would be appreciated. Thanks everyone. I've read a lot of posts and this community seems extremely supportive.",2,5

But he chain smokes and puts them further and further in debt because he can't work and also won't seek disability.

He caught pneumonia about 8 years ago. The doctor gave him an oral steroid. He pounded the stuff and ended up coughing so hard that he dislocated the optic nerve in his left eye. So he's blind in one eye because of it.

I no longer live with them, but whenever I visit I notice that he goes into coughing fits and blacks out. So I assume it's once per day that he'll have a coughing fit, get a bloody nose, or black out. He carries a nebulizer and has three breathing steroids he takes.

I feel like I‚Äôm. battling cravings constantly. But now when I come face to face with them, I breathe deeply in, and calmly ask myself; what is it that is nibbling madly at my mind and my wellbeing?
It isn‚Äôt the nicotine. That poor sucker has dehydrated and died by now. But what is it that keeps knocking hard at my door?

It‚Äôs possibility. And what‚Äôs worst, potential. It terrifies me. I wake up refreshed. I have energy to just get up and get on with so many of the usual things I usually do. But what is unusual is that I actually end up finishing them. What freaks me out further is that I still have energy to do more.

This can‚Äôt be right. How can I have accomplished anything if I‚Äôm not bitter, burnt out and yelling at cracks in the sidewalk? This extra energy needs to be burnt. I mean after all I have spent the last two decades of my life consistently burning things. Motivated only by an induced understanding that if it burns, it needs to be burnt.

So what are these cravings I keep getting? What is the cause of this anxiety? It‚Äôs essentially the experience of energetic possibilities occurring concurrently with a need to rapidly burn up all the energy. Not very sustainable. And at the same time, not very economic or productive.

How have I learnt to face these cravings caused by a fear of unused energy? Norway. 
I‚Äôve trained myself to stop, breathe in, breathe out and meditate on Norway.

Norway is a nation that is overloaded with energy resources. Unlike other energy rich nations, Norway takes it slow. Norway piles away a whole lot of energy for a rainy day. Norway keeps it cool. 

Booms are nice. But the Bust? You definitely don‚Äôt want it. Don‚Äôt force the hangover. 

Anxious from all the excess energy from quitting smoking? Feel that it‚Äôs too much? Overwhelmed with stress on figuring how to spend this abundance and of energy!‚Äò?

I mean you could go for a run or something. Or you could simply funnel this excess energy into your imaginary Scrooge McDuck swimming pool. When you need to chill out, you can go swimming it. When the world outside of you demands it, you know you have enough to spend when it‚Äôs needed.

Do you think Scrooge McDuck could go swimming in a pool of gold coins, if every time he got an extra gold coin he desperately worked out how to spend it?

TLDR
You‚Äôve striked gold. Since you‚Äôve quit smoking you have more energy than you‚Äôve ever really wanted or needed. It makes you anxious. You feel guilty not spending it. Chill out. You don‚Äôt need to spend it or use it. Your excess energy resource boom doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be more productive. It means you can be wealthy. Bank this energy. If you really need it, you know you‚Äôve got it to spare. Otherwise just swim in it, and revel that you can do swim a lap or two without getting completely out of breath.",8,0

I started smoking weed because I felt like it helped me cope with some of my mental issues and normal  to day life. I'd smoke 3/4 joints after I finished work (after 7pm) i had been smoking everyday for close to 5 years and tried to quit a few times in between but I'd always go back after a few weeks.

Now that were in quarantine I'd thought it would be the perfect time to quit as the withdrawls wont effect my day to day life while working and I could fight through them knowing I dont have to go to work.
The first week was difficult as I had really bad insomnia and was extremely irritable plus I'd have a fever that would come and go for a day. my anxiety was causing my heart rate to shoot up which really got me scared. I contacted my doctor and he had prescribed me some pills to cope with my heart rate, these worked really well and I started to lay off them after a week. 
During the same time I had alot of phlegm come up and a tightness in my throat which was similar to a sore throat but I didnt have a cough.I also had extreme sweats at night forcing me to drink alot of water throughout the day and night around 2.5l. 

My diet has drastically changed aswell as I was training before this and consuming alot of calories but stopping weed had contributed to my loss of appetite plus being in quarantine limited me getting enough food everyday. I still have these sweats and a little insomnia but now I have new symptoms such as diarrhea in the morning and gasses in my stomach every time I eat. My throat has been sore ever since quitting and I still have alot phlegm that I need to spit out. 

Sometimes I have hoarseness in my voice and have to clear it out. I dont know what's the cause for this and I am a little worried.

I spoke to my doctor and not being able to see him in person is really difficult. He prescribed my anti biotic as he thought I may have an infection due to the extreme phlegm I spit out.

I was wondering if anyone knew what the cause for my stomach gasses and diarrhea was. Could it be the anxiety and my diet change causing this or do I have a bigger problem. Plus the tightness in my chest and sharp little pains in my lungs now and again. 

Has anyone been through the same situation or have a clearer understanding of this?

Advices?","I write this searching for advice, but also as a confession of sort I guess (??) I just need to get it out of my chest.

Just to put you in **context**:

I've never been a heavy smoker. I started to smoke in April last year and after 6 months I quit smoking. Well, not on my own will tbh. I spent two weeks without smoking because of economic reasons *(I know that in different countries tobacco price can be higher or lower, but we all know is an economical black hole to your savings).* 

The point is that when I got the money, my dumb ass bough a pack of cigarettes. Thank god the moment I lit that cigarette and started to inhaled that poison, an awful taste developed in my mouth. I also hated the smell and honestly it was disgusting. I should have tossed away the pack, but I didn't. 

Now the '**situation**': 

I'm not having a good year, I mean, no one is f\*cking having a good year so far, but before the pandemic I was in a bad place and I haven't gone out since January. Now I feel an urge (?) to smoke again. I don't want to, of course, because, well I know that the same thing that happened the last time, is going to happen again; but I'm also afraid that it won't happen that and I'll become a smoker again, and obviously I don't want to have that shit on my life again.

Four days into. Today feeling like shit, body aches, chills in the upper part of the back, and dizziness. It feels like flu, but I am confident that it is not. I do not feel fever and not have any cough at all. But I'm hypochondriac and now a part of me is paranoic that they are symptoms of coronavirus. I've already passed through withdrawals two times in my life and I know feeling this way is common. But my mind is fucking me hard

I'm going to start with an admission, I smoked on wednesday evening, I felt desperate and dug through my flat and found the remnants of an old pouch and managed to roll a smoke, I took 3 drags from it and in the anger at myself and also the disgust, it didn't taste nice, it didnt smell nice and I thought ""I prefer my vape"". I threw away ALL smoking apparatus still in my flat, I hadn't thrown my ashtray out or the packs of papers / filters I still had, and lighters. 

I took the bin out and it was collected the next morning so I can't get them back even if I really really wanted to.

Since this, I have had no cravings, no desire to smoke, I've even vaped a lot less if I am completely honest. After food hasn't sucked and when I wake up it hasn't been in my mind the last 2 days. 

I am actually really happy with this, tomorrow is my birthday but what I'm most looking forward to is the app tell me 1 week is done.

In 5 days and 20 hours, (I started my quit at 3pm in the afternoon), I have \*NOT\* smoked 115.99 cigarettes, that's bloody mad when I think about it. This is a motivation to keep going. I've avoided poisoning my body 115.99 times so far and its not even been a week.

I haven't changed my quit date as a few puffs only solidified my quit, I am sticking with the same date and I know some might disagree but its more of a motivation to me. I am better than smoking and I am a non smoker. 

Thank you for reading my rambling wall of text haha!",24,0

I went off the NRT about a month ago cause I didn‚Äôt want to go to any pharmacies if I don‚Äôt need to atm, but caved today. Bought a pack and smoked two cigarettes. I told myself it was because of covid stress and my work director being absolutely shit and incompetent during this awful era, but I know that was just an excuse. Immediately regretted what I did, I feel physically awful just from the two cigarettes after not smoking for quite a long time. Feel super sluggish and depressed, even though I told myself originally smoking would help relieve my stress, that was a lie. Binned my pack ($48 Australian down the drain), reset my quit date. 

I‚Äôm determined to no longer smoke and no longer depend on NRT. I know it can help for many people but for me my relationship with it was unhealthy and still definitely an addiction. Those 10 minutes of smoking was not worth what it did to my immediate health and what it will do if I keep going down this path.

However, I'm still having major problems concentrating on my work. My brain feels like it is made of cotton, and it's hard to make myself focus or thinking about big problems. I feel kind of dumb. As a result today I basically didn't get anything done.

This might be the quitting anxiety speaking but I feel like if I am not productive every day, people will figure it out and there will be consequences. I'm new and on a week to week contract, and with this covid recession thing they are probably trying to get rid of people.

How did you stay employed while quiting?

Ways of approaching work that... work? Ways to get stuff done?

&#x200B;

Edit: in case anyone finds this searching back through old threads - my brain started working again towards the end of week 2, and by the end of week 3 I could think like normal again.

I'm now on day 40 and I'd say the last three weeks have really been about desperately trying to catch up on work and repair relationships (at work and home) that were damaged during the quit. 

But in the end, people get sick sometimes, and the world goes on. You can probably get away with being ineffective for a little while. Best to take sick or annual leave if you can though. ",1,1

Firat time posting here and seeing people succed makes me want to try it again.

Some perspective, I first tried smoking around 9 year old, cus of the neighborhood, and disliked it immedietly. My mother found out and gave me a slap. I didn't realize it then, but I was lucky that is missed me at such a young age. Then came middleschool, and aroung age 12, I started again off peer preassure and wanting to belong here. I started off like half a pack a day right away.

Im 24years old now,  after a tragedy I started to smoke 2 pack a day, for the last 3 years. 

You would thing I'm sick all day. But acctually, I a vegitarian, I doing good at my faculty, I train, I meditate regulary for 2years, I'm feeling okey. 

Nicotine is a thing my mind just cant understand. It's the worst part of my life, and makes up a bunch off the day just smoking around. 

More than anything, I just want to finally quit the weed, and live life fully, because when I stopped for 3weeks at one point, man it was amazing, just smelling the world and the bakery. Its all dull and gray when you smoke.

When I decided to quit, it was because I had weird mucus constantly being coughed out of my lungs, I could feel pockets of sputum trapped in strange places in my lungs, and once I decided to quit, I haven't looked back at the decision.

However, I find myself craving cigarettes often. This need is reducing with working out and focusing on productive interests and such but my lung health has returned to almost normal (I think). I keep getting thoughts that I can control the habit if I restart it moderately. It doesn't help that all my friends, who are actually great people, are smokers.

Since I am young I just figured I would eventually stop as I entered adulthood, but not really, I used to smoke one pack a week and now it is 3/4 for some two years already.

Thing is, I really don't feel like nicotine is the problem for me, I feel like I'm addicted to the body movements I do, and using it as an excuse to pause whatever I'm doing for a couple of minutes.

I've heard vaping would be an option, but honestly I'm skeptical in terms of health benefits. Looks like research into its effects is controversial, and I would still be spending money continuously to keep the habit.

I'm never going to take another drag of a cigarette as long as I live. I'm done. I will not allow these things to do me in. Rob my son of his father.

I'm pretty sure the Nicoderm means I'm not going through withdrawal, so why the hell is this so hard? I'm emotional, depressed, wanna cry, irritated over everything.

I want to begin by saying I gave up heroin in October, and gave up weed 24 days ago. I also have had an off and on romance with xanax that I also now have under control. Those were three BIG things for me to take care of. I have also tremendously cut down my intake of simple sugar - some time ago (maybe 4-5 months) I gave up all soda, juice, and the like. So anyway...

I smoked a pack a day for about four years, and then vaped for about 4 years. I'm tired of polluting my lungs. Even though I haven't suffered any sort of smokers cough despite the weed/cigarettes/vaping, the vaping has been causing me to have a ridiculously high heart rate, and I get out of breath too easily. To be specific, I tested my heart rate a few minutes after I woke up in the morning (I'm 6'1"", 325lb, 28 years old male): it was in the mid 60s; soon after I tested my heart rate again after I had started vaping for the day: it was in the mid 90s - that's a serious problem.

As such, I plan to at least quit vaping, and by that I mean to say I don't necessarily want to be in a rush to give up nicotine altogether. I have given up SO many of my addictions as it is but I want to stop harming my lungs right away - which is why a patch seems to be a good option.

**My question(s)/thoughts:**

I currently vape \~20ml a day of 3mg ejuice, equaling a total of 60mg. Now, I believe it's highly unlikely I'm actually absorbing 60mg. The average cigarette contains (in the tobacco itself) \~8mg of nicotine, but studies have shown only about 2mg is absorbed (roughly 25%). Furthermore, cigarette smokers tend to inhale the smoke much more 'completely', as in, very little 'gas' escapes (it's inhaled more completely.) I've come to reason that when I vape I'm probably absorbing (tops) about 15% of the nicotine that's actually vaporized. This would mean that I'm absorbing 9mg a day. With this in consideration it seems to make sense that I should start with a 14mg patch. (Now I'll be taking the patch off when I sleep - for eight hours - meaning that I'd only absorb 2/3rds worth of the nicotine patch daily, which would be 9.33mg).

Does this make sense to you guys, these numbers I've come up with? Does anyone have experience with this? I plan on staying on the 14mg patch for a month, then switching to the 7mg patch. Cold turkey is out of the question because I could end up having a full blown relapse on everything and be shooting dope and smoking weed again and obviously that would be a disaster.

Does anyone else have experience switching from vaping to a nicotine patch with success?

Anyways, it fucks me up holy shit. I stopped the binge 4 days ago and it was the worst binge I have had ever - I smoked 3 whole packs in 4 days, coming from smoking one cigarette in the past month.

There is a memorable analogy that he mentioned in the book. Craving is compared to a sore wound.

I am two weeks clean off of nicotine. This has been great and all except I have really really bad cravings. Sometimes my cravings will be back to back or last hours at a time. 

In general my cravings are manageable and I can stave them off. My biggest issue comes from my old habits. I used to work on homework with nicotine. Now I find it so incredibly hard to focus that my homework is not even getting done. I‚Äôm at my wits end. 

Previously I used NRT my quit week. (3 weeks ago). Now that I‚Äôve gotten through withdrawals (insomnia was living hell). Would I have any issues if I started using NRT pouches while doing homework? I understand ZYN sells 3mg pouches which seems like a great amount considering Juul pods and cigarette packs contain 50+mg of nicotine.

What are the dangers of using NRT again? Will I get addicted to nicotine again? Will I have to go through withdrawals again? If I am extremely careful and only use the ZYN pouches for a really bad craving will they help get me through to the summer when school stress won‚Äôt effect my quitting? 

I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve come so far and I don‚Äôt want to ruin my progress. However, most of you have dealt with and understand how difficult it is to break a specific smoking habit. (I.e. if I always took a puff for doing a homework problem ‚Äòcorrectly‚Äô how do I change that habit?) I don‚Äôt know how to focus my mind on homework without the nicotine anymore.

I started stealing them from my mom. 
From stores if had no money. 
Take hour long bike rides in the wildest storms Germany has to offer to get some. I do loved it. It was fun stealing hanging out sonwhere smoking secretly. 
What a fucking time waste. 
I smoked ciggis from when I was probably 13 or 14 till 16 and then switched to rollling them to ciggis back and forth. My ex smoked tobacco my mum did in the kitchen. Dad probably hidden from sight never saw him do it at least. 
Here I am laying in my bed rolling one dirty tar bomb up waiting to get that ‚Äúhalf stroke‚Äù high that you get

I‚Äôm dying to quit. 
I really do. 

But I love marijuana 
And I love blunts and bong rips but the stuff is not for smoking on the job like ciggis I‚Äôm all for keeping fun for the weekend. 
So I tried quitting smoking 6 or 7 times this year alone. Never made it over 6 days with the help of a little green flower. 
I‚Äôm scared that I can‚Äôt quit when my mum smells like smoke I wanna der an example tho. 
I‚Äôm REALLY scared for my next girl is a smoker too and I can‚Äôt resist just smoking with her. 
I want the change for my lungs my healt and my voice but I just can‚Äôt do it my grandpa and my dad made it but never really passed the spirit on to me I wanna quit before I reach the age they quit in but also don‚Äôt want to leave Mary Jane out of the game. 
Makes sense? 
I don‚Äôt know.  
Tried vaping 1 1/2 years. Started smoking again. 
Tried menthol candy as having replacement. Just asked for cigarettes. Started smoking again. 
Patches. Gums. Candy. 
Doesn‚Äôt work on me like that I think because I started so early it‚Äôs the life I know that I can‚Äôt change. 
Like the constant presence of smoke and cigars. 

So this is it. I want to start another attempt when I get my welfare check üòé corona rocks! Not. Fuck that. 
My plan? By a pack of cigarettes and tobacco with all the stuff to it.
Lighters filters papers. 
And then let it sit. 

If I can make myself not smoke that stuff while I own it, I can beat it. And then pass that onto someone I feel deserves it. Even if they smoke it I hope the message gets through. 

I‚Äôm asking, how am I gonna do it with the weed?

It's been a month already since he passed away at age 41. About seven months ago he called me on an idle Tuesday sounding anxious and sad and asking for a lift to the hospital. He was coughing blood and told me that he'd been feeling sick for a while now, but had been too afraid to go to the hospital. He kept saying he's sorry for causing this to the rest of our family and I was just trying to be there for him and kept saying let's take it one step at a time, we don't know anything yet. He was diagnosed with pneumonia and told that he'd be contacted soon as the images of his lungs showed some ""shadows"" that needed to be looked at. Within two days he was back at the hospital and the results came within a day: it was stage 4 cancer and after a biopsy, within a week it was confirmed as a small cell lung cancer. Uncurable, so all that they were going to be able to do was to slow it down.  
They tried two different sytostatins and some radiation, but nothing stopped this cancer, as it was too aggressive.  
I won't go into detail about those months, but it was a painful fight for him, and throughout it all he blamed himself and kept asking for forgiveness from us.  


I have three siblings, out of which two smoke. Smoking took my grandfather at age 70, my father at age 50 and one of my brothers.  
I'm having difficulties coping with this loss for several reasons, the least of which being that my brother was a great guy. Always willing to help, always willing to listen and he always saw the best in everyone. And thanks to corona there'll be ten people at his funeral.  


What I have issue with is that why weren't we able to help him quit smoking before it went this far. Could we as his family have helped him in any way? And it hits really hard as I have one big brother left, who is also a smoker and he's been trying to quit for several times as well. They both started as teenagers, and they were both there burying our father and saw his last years. It seems pretty obvious that with our genes smoking is pretty much a death sentence. I don't want to pressure him or blame him for continuing smoking, but I don't want to live through another six months like we just had and keep wondering whether I could've done something more. So  I know I won't be able to keep my mouth shut.

Just today I looked at the statistics and it seems like tobacco is a 900 billion dollar business that is killing 7 million people yearly directly, and another 1 million through second hand smoking. That number probably doesn't include people like our stepmother, who 3 months after our father's death took her own life.

I'm just tired of this addictive substance that keeps profiting a handful of rich people, and wondering how can anyone work for a business like that. At least for our family it's a slow and expensive suicide which the people you care about are forced to watch from the side, feeling helpless.

Sorry for the rambling long post.  
For all of you trying to quit, I wish you all the best and the strength to power through it. If you find it difficult and keep falling back, don't be ashamed of it and blame yourself. Get back to it as soon as you can, and don't be afraid to ask for help. I'm not sure what help others can give you, but if they're thinking like me, they'll absolutely thank you for giving them the possibility of even trying to help you. While my brother was still alive, his friend failed at quitting and he said ""it ain't easy, don't be too hard on yourself."" And seeing those statistics I'm sure he was right. I've been telling the rest of our family that there's a reason why it's such a big business and keeps on growing: no one man can fight it alone, so let's not hold it against him that he lost that fight as well.

TL;DR:  
Just lost a big brother at age 41 to aggressive lung cancer, after losing our father and a grandfather for the same reason: smoking. I still have one big brother who's a smoker, so what, if anything, can I do to help him get and stay motivated at quitting, and make his quitting as easy as possible? Or is there anything that one can do to help a person you love to beat this thing?",24,1

Here I am, recovering & I want to give it my best shot to permanently kick smoking out of my life. I want my lungs to heal, I want to not have a god awful wheeze (I‚Äôm asthmatic too so it doesn‚Äôt help) I want to feel energised not lethargic and sloppy. I have some gum that is 4mg of nicotine every piece, which I am going to try, being in lockdown my options of getting anything else is pretty nil. My dad is a heavy smoker, my mum smokes 1 a day in the evening. I can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt convince them to change their habits, as that is their choice, but it super hard when I know they‚Äôre doing that. I need new coping mechanisms I guess, I remind myself how lucky I am to still be here right now which is a huge one in itself.

I‚Äôve gotten into so many fights with my sister and friends about this stupid device because either they want me to quit and i defend myself cause of my addiction, or they want to smoke my juul but i‚Äôm stingey in sharing and wasting pods. 

I‚Äôve tried to quit before multiple times. I end up throwing my juul away, but then a few hours later i cave and end up buying a new one cause they‚Äôre fairly cheap now.

It consumes my mind and life when i don‚Äôt have it, and I end up not doing the things i need to do and just lay in bed.. I‚Äôve watched videos on how to quit, and the first thing I learned is that i have to change my mindset and WANT to quit...but that‚Äôs the thing..I don‚Äôt want to, but i know i need to. 

I need help. And my doctor says to try the patches or the lozenges or gum, but i think i‚Äôm more addicted to smoking something than the actual nicotine? Idk, i think it‚Äôs both cause i‚Äôve also tried getting pods with 0% nicotine, but it doesn‚Äôt do it for me.

He's been smoking for a reallyyy long time and for a few years now he would smoke in the bathroom every few hours or so. My bedroom is adjacent to his, with the bathroom in the middle separating our bathrooms. Often when I enter the bathroom to pee I hold my breath while I do my business. Two doors is enough to block the smell from coming into my room but I think I'm still exposed to the secondhand smoke, which can probably drift through the door slits or something. Sometimes when I hear him leaving the bathroom I wait about 30 minutes to an hour before entering to bathe or take a poop.   


This habit has been annoying me for a really long while. It's kind of an open secret. He knows that I know he smokes, but I've never brought it up to him before. He has only just retired and used to be very busy, so we don't have a relationship where we talk deeply about personal problems. I'm 18, I've never had major health problems, never smoked, and I've promised myself I never will. I care a lot about my health but I can't stand the fact that I'm exposed to secondhand smoke on a daily basis, especially now during isolation. My grandmother and our family doctor has told him about it a few times but he doesn't listen.   


I want to get him to stop. But I have no idea how to approach him.

I'm 18, turning 19 in a week. I really started smoking when I was 17 and told myself I wasn't a real smoker until I bought myself a pack, which now is about once or twice a week for me. I heard once its a lot harder to quit after the first year, which Ive passed now by like 6 months and I want to quit. 

I really would like to be able to have a casual relationship with smoking, never think about it and just have one every once in a while with a beer or something you know? I think my biggest issue is the oral fixation, the physical sensation of having something in my lungs, and just the act of smoking is so devilishly satisfying.

 I dont know what to do, because I want to quit but I dont feel ready, but at the same time why am I doing something that makes me feel crappy in retrospect. I know I'll be disappointed in myself later so why am I doing it? Why try quitting when I know it wont last... Im really just trying to not beat myself up too much and remind myself everyone quits in their own way but I feel like I'll never get it together to stop.

I skipped my normal morning dose just to confirm it is happening when I take the medicine. I was feeling alright until recently, when I took my afternoon dose and now I'm in that tired/lethargic state again. 

I'm guessing it is some kind of reaction from the nicotine withdrawal as I used to chain vape when I was on it. And these side-effects were not there until 4-5 days after quitting smoking.

‚Ä¢ Smell and taste recovered fairly quickly, and has been the strongest in the past week (end week 3 / week 4). 

‚Ä¢ Breathing does get easier! I had a mild cough, and still do sometimes, but my breathing has eased up and I no longer wake up feeling like I am inhaling mucous. My chest feels far less tight.

‚Ä¢ Unfortunately, the cravings are still strong, but this is a time of increased stress. The cravings are the most difficult part about this whole experience. I‚Äôm still trying to beat the part of my brain that craves more - that thinks that smoking will solve the stress. 

‚Ä¢ Mentally speaking, my mood swings are still a bit difficult to deal with. I have a feeling my emotions are still trying to go into equilibrium. I have read that this process takes around 1 - 3 months, but I‚Äôm not certain how accurate that is.  I sometimes have intense emotions, other times I tend to feel flat and depressed.

On a rational level, I know of course that that‚Äôs not true and it‚Äôs the addiction talking. I also know the part about cigarettes just scratching an itch that wouldn‚Äôt be there without them. 

My mind is also rationalizing a lot and telling me things like ‚ÄúThis is your first serious attempt at quitting. People always say they needed multiple attempts. You can just give in this time.‚Äù

Yoga and meditation help, but not to the point where they make that voice go away. It‚Äôs not like I feel an urgent, violent need to smoke right now, it‚Äôs more that since I feel the determination slowly going down, I fear that in more triggering situations it will be much harder to resist.

My fiance still smokes.  She tried to quit when I did 3 days ago but is going through a stressful time so I gave her a reprieve and told her I'd be okay if she kept smoking until she was ready because let's be honest, a smoker can only quit when the smoker want to quit.

Before coming into the bedroom to write this, I noticed her pack of cigarettes on the kitchen counter, picked the pack up and looked it over, thinking to myself how something so small could have so a large impact on people's lives.  I opened the pack and their were a few in there, I took a deep breath through my nose and was honestly repulsed by the odor of unburnt tobacco and it reminded me of what I told myself when I was sitting in my car 3 days ago.  I held my cigarette up to my face at eye level, with a single drag left and I said ""I am not going to be your slave anymore"", took the last drag as the ""Marlboro"" print was consumed by the cherry and threw that cigarette butt as far as I could.  

As I was holding her pack of cigarettes in the kitchen, I looked at them one more time and said ""I told you I wasn't going to be your slave anymore""

637,2020-04-10 11:30:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/fyhykj/day_2/,Day 2,"I had my last cigarette 48 hours ago, Wednesday April 8th. And it's only partly because I want to quit. I've been wanting to for years but when you're surrounded by smokers it's impossible. 

But with the lockdown in effect in my country, I haven't been interacting much with anyone and I got my cigarettes delivered to me for the first couple of weeks. But over time the prices started to go up, eventually I was paying 3 times more for a pack and then starting this week the supply in all nearby stores dried up. So getting a cigarette is next to impossible right now. But if I was motivated enough and willing to pay an arm and a leg for it I could get enough cigarettes to last me till the end of the month. 

My first thought was regret. Regret for not purchasing a couple of pouches of rolling tobacco before the lockdown so I wouldn't be in this situation. But as I got to my last pack earlier this week I had a new thought: maybe this is the perfect opportunity to quit. Not that I have much of a choice right now but I'm resisting the temptation to reach out to the black market for my fix. So I can't get cigarettes easily, I'm home alone and not in the cloud of cigarette smoke that usually accompanies my friends and I have nothing better to do. So I'm going to quit.

Today has not been easy. One of my biggest triggers is tea and I found three tea bags today (tea has also become a scarce commodity in my city üò¢). After meals the craving is high. But I also realized if I ignore it, it goes away so that's what I've been doing. Netflix, books and Reddit are all good distractions. 

But I've been down this road before. Went 10 days in 2018 without a cigarette but then fell into it again. Before that it was 2 weeks in 2016 and a month in 2012. Hopefully this is the final one. This time I quit for good.

Wish me luck, folks!",15,2

That number holds significance because I decided to quit the weekend we found out my dad had a lung tumor. I've posted before months ago and a few people said it really helped so I thought I'd share again so maybe it may help other people or new members.

I recently lost my dad. He was 60 years old, and a very important person to a lot of people including his wife and 5 children ranging from 10 to 30 years old. He LOVED life! He always said he believed we were here to have fun. That's what I hated most about him being sick - he hated sadness and pity.  

I was there with him, my brother and my stepmom when we found out about the lung tumor. He had gone to the ER for a pain in his rib. We thought it was his heart as he had problems before. I'll never forget the fear we all felt when we found out - he was not one of those lucky people who smoked their whole life and lived to be 80. After fear comes regret and that's what really woke me up to quit myself.  

I did not want to end up where my dad did, thinking about all those times that I should have quit. I remember him driving my sister and I to grade school over 20 years ago, and he had a sucker in his mouth and was irritable- trying to quit. If only I could get into a time machine and tell him where his journey ended, I'm pretty sure he would have succeeded in quitting then.  

The truth is... we all know as smokers that cancer is probably going to meet us one day or another. We don't talk about it or think about it. We cling to the stories of that one person who knew someone whose grandmother smoked her whole life and died in her sleep of old age. But if that's not how it goes, can you handle your regret? 

There really is nothing like hearing that even with treatment, your dad will maybe get 12-18 months and I can not imagine hearing it about yourself. When they found it was in the brain, they started just saying around 12 months. Because my dad had younger children, he decided to try and stay here as long as possible. As it turned out with treatment and brain radiation, my dad died almost exactly 5 months after they found his lung tumor.   

Please, please quit. Not just for your loved ones, but for yourself. What lung cancer did to my dad physically was hard enough, but what was harder to watch was knowing he was scared and anxious though he did his best to hide it. I don't want that for anyone which is why I share this. I too thought I'd never quit, I relied on smoking and it was a part of me. I'm 7 months smoke free and not looking back, most days I don't even think about it. Once you truly decide you are done, you will succeed.

I quit the day after we found out about my dad. I got really drunk and smoked a lot that night. The first day was easy, suffering from a horrible hangover. After that, I used patches (a great crutch that really eliminated me trying to bullshit talk my way into buying a pack), a crap ton of sugar free wintergreen mints, and the Smoke Free app to help me.   

There were a lot of times that I wanted to smoke throughout my quit journey, especially with what my dad and family was going through. I overcame all the cravings except for a couple puffs on Christmas Eve, stressed and scared it was going to be my last one with my dad. Know that if you stumble, you can keep going. It does not have to be a restart and you did not necessarily lose anything as long as you keep quitting.  

I don't share this for any condolences, I just wanted to show the reality of what can happen if we don't quit so that it may help someone else succeed. I think my dad would want to help other people too. Best of luck to everyone, I truly hope every single one of you succeeds with all my heart.",104,0

I've been smoking nonstop since I was 13, and I am 31 right now. 4 years ago I completely stopped smoking tobacco in favor of the vaping pen. And for the last 4 years I've been doing that, a lot. 

I kept increasing the amount of nicotine in it, up until 18mg. I was vaping almost all day. I didn't get any health issues. Didn't need to cough excessively or anything. All fine and dandy. But what annoyed me the most is that it was controlling my entire life. Scratch that, what ACTUALLY annoyed me most was the fact that -in my mind- this was 'okay'. 

Get up in the morning, gotta vape. Put on my working clothes, vape. Brush teeth, vape. Get in car, vape all the way to work. Then I get to work, and I spent most of my day checking the clock and my watch to see when I could go vape again. And I honestly believed this was all normal. That is what this disgusting crap does to you. It gets into your brain, makes you believe and think the most ridiculous things to justify your addiction. 

Well, 12 days ago now, I said I had enough. It was the perfect time. Now with this corona virus going around, I'm off work for a few weeks. I can suffer in solitude, without the stress of work or any other obligation. Distractions enough; Doom Eternal, Resident Evil 3, Final Fantasy 7. Plenty to do. 

My anger towards this addiction, towards my own weakness, is what drives me to quit. I can comfortably say that I am so mad, that I haven't felt the need to vape/smoke yet. Because whenever that desire comes up again, I immediately get angry at myself and the feeling goes away. 

Unfortunately, it is not all that easy. Since the first night of quitting, up until now, I haven't slept for more than 2 consecutive hours. And it is wreaking havoc on my body. It had gotten so bad that 2 days ago I was brought to the hospital by ambulance because I had a massive panic attack. (I felt something was really going wrong, so I alerted my mother in advance to keep an eye on me .)

Never in all my 31 years have I had a panic attack. Nothing even remotely close. I felt like I was dying. Couldn't breath, my chest felt heavy, arms and legs were numb, dizzy to the point I couldn't even stand on my own two feet. But despite all of this, I refuse to give up. I still have not taken a single whiff of nicotine. 

The doctors ran various tests on my health and thankfully I am in pristine condition. Not someone who goes to the gym regularly, but (almost) daily long walks with my dog keeps me in shape. 

I am getting a bit worried. I am afraid that at this rate my body or mind might give out. Sure, I have read some articles about people and their withdrawal symptoms, but never this bad. I still have not slept properly for a single night, and this is what worries me the most. Insomnia is a pretty life-threatening ordeal and should not continue for an extended period of time. Yet it has troubled me for 12 days now and already landed me in the hospital. 

I have called my doctor twice in these last few days, but he refuses to see me. Only incredibly urgent cases are allowed because of the corona virus. Naturally he tells me to just hang on, don't give up, etc etc. Predictable advice that really doesn't do anything. Everyone says that. But what else are they supposed to say? 

I don't know what anyone here can say that will make me feel better, or perhaps safer. But just putting my story on here helps somewhat. Even if people just talk about it with me, it helps. Thank you for reading and good health to all of you.",5,4

While loading it into the truck it fell off and I managed to grab it before it rolled onto the ground. Thank God. But when we loaded it the second time I felt like I was gonna die. Holding this damn thing up while trying to load it into the truck took everything out of me. And several times it nearly rolled back down on me had I not somehow pushed through and get it on. Still no clue how I did it.

Once it was on though I couldn't breathe. I had strained myself so badly I felt my lungs weighing heavy in my chest. After several minutes f very laboured breathing I got it under control long enough to start coughing and dry heaving. Thankfully I hadn't eaten or I would have puked everywhere. All that day and yesterday my lungs felt like they were on fire and continued to feel heavy. I could breathe fine, but there was pain. Today the pain went away, but as per usual as soon as I tried walking any amount of time longer than say 2 minutes. I felt my lungs get heavy and I would be unable to catch my breath. This has been happening more and more over the last year. Prior to that I had no real breathing issues. I have noticed it getting worse and worse and tonight, just now in fact, it peaked in my opinion. I walked outside to the car to grab a couple cases of pop to bring in and had to stop and sit on the way to the car, the way back, and whwn I got half way up the stairs I felt the heaviness in my lungs.

Idk why this time was different from any of the other times, but I just told myself I was done. I have been saying it for the last few years as I noticed my breathing problems develop. But tonight I came into my room and opened my just purchased pack and ripped them up and threw them in the garbage. And I threw out my lighter with it. I still have a bag of old shitty emergency lighters in storage I need to toss, but my cat is sleeping on the box so it will have to wait.

I have done this song and dance before. And obviously it hasn't worked. So who knows if it will this time. But I just had to write this down to get it out there. And since my cat is sleeping the only other thing I have to talk to is the void that is the internet. So ya. That's it I guess. I'm on antidepressants that are supposed to cause weight loss and help with quitting smoking. So I'm hoping they actually help. Though the weight I have gained and how I kept smoking doesn't have me too confident on that. But ya. My only plan is to go walk up and down the stairs when I get cravings to smoke and let the gasping for air be a reminder of why I don't actually want a cigarette. 

I'm worried the most for a couple days from now. I often can't afford them anyway, so it's normal for me to go a couple days to a week without smoking with. Relative ease. But I'm in a shitty toxic living situation that's only been made worse by the quarantine. So ya. Here's hoping I guess.

I was a 20 a day smoker who quit a week ago, i've been using the Nicotinell 21mg patch except when sleeping, and just swapped to the nicabate 21mg patch today.

About three days ago I woke up to a spotty rash on my ankles, wrist and in the last day and a half it has started at my ears too. It has been persistent the whole time. The skin around my cheeks/under my eyes is also very dry and irritated even though I moisturize daily.

I've never had these issues and nothing else has changed (diet/weather). 

Wondering whether it might be an allergic reaction to the patch (hence why changed brands) but the locations used for the patches themselves are totally fine. Asked my chemist but they were clueless. 

Otherwise wondering whether this is a more general response to quitting smoking? anyone had similar? cheers.",1,0

I'm at the point where I want to quit for good. But I'm terrified of the withdrawal symptoms. Going through the pain and headaches and even nausea makes me want to give up the thought of quitting. And I have a 3 year old. He's my everything and I really want to be a better momma, without losing my mind. For those parents out there.. I assume you know that it's not really terrible twos, but the thunderous threes that really test parents. 

I've read a couple of articles on how to lessen the withdrawal symptoms and a lot of them suggest CBD oil. It is the only thing I haven't tried.. and I've tried everything from NRT, vaping, and even the wives tale of drinking Orange juice with cream of tartar...weird right?! Ha. 

The point is that I'd like some other suggestions on easing the withdrawal symptoms and if any of you have success stories with CBD oil and how to properly use it..

I got into vaping 3 years ago and I decided about a month ago that it's time to stop. Since then I've been cutting down my puffs drastically. I used to take around 250 to 500 puffs a day and now I'm at 25 at most. This week I wanted to try not to vape at all but it's so hard. For the past days I only vaped twice a day so it's not that many any more but I still want to get rid of the eager to get some nicotine in my lungs. I tried to drink water every time I want to vape but that didn't really work out. Now I leave my batteries uncharged because I thought this would help me not to reach for my vape but sadly I just plug my batteries in and wait a couple of minutes... Anyhow, I know I'm not doing so bad considering that I just vape twice a day now but I was just wondering if there were some things I could do to improve or if I'm doing quite alright.

I have been addicted to nicotine for a long time, and have often been on and off for the better part of 10 years since I turned 18. I started with cigs/cloves, quickly moved to vapes, and never went back. After changing to vaping I still always wanted to quit, but I feel like I'm hopelessly addicted.

I've quit a few times for extended periods up to almost a year, but I always go back. When I'm off, it sucks at first as expected but I always end up feeling great, frequenting /r/stopsmoking, using any coping mechanism I can like meditation and exercise, etc. But somehow I always cave that one time, and it always slides into daily use, no matter how much I think I'm in control. I can resist the urge a million times but it just takes one bad decision to relapse.

The last time I relapsed was about a year into my relationship. She found out a few months later and I felt terrible about hiding it and ended up quitting shortly after.  Because I'm a fucking idiot, I still somehow started doing it behind her back again this time, and she caught me this morning.

I have no idea why I relapsed, and even less why I lie about it. I know it's wrong. I'm destroying her trust for no reason. She's rightfully extremely upset. I have nobody but myself to blame. Ik people will probably rag on me for lying to her, but trust me, I'm well aware of why it's terrible. I'm an open book in every other aspect of my life, yet I feel this terrible shame about this that I couldn't get the courage to tell her.

I'm going to quit again, and I want to make it last, but it feels so hard when in even 9 months from now I can be fine one day, and feeling completely out of control the next day. Quitting is almost easy at this point, it's the random unknown day that can come at any point for the rest of my life that scares me.

While I know that I just ""got caught,"" I want this for myself. She wants me to quit but isn't forcing me, despite being very upset. I've never wanted to be addicted to this shit, and I never want to lie to her and myself like this.",13,0

If anything comes across just saying I'm Scottish so if something comes across that's not understandable just let me translate because it's a partially drunk post too. I've decided to stop vaping and go cold turkey from her on out. I have a great family and one of my main motivations is my dog. He's a Ridgeback who are African dogs who are incredibly active. I need to be active as he's an active dog and I want him to get the most out of his life. As well as partaking in other things my family do. I smoked since I was turning 16 and now I am turning 18. I'm applying for the police force (call me a pig if you want). I stopped for a while last year but got very drunk and fucked it up again.  I want to be able to do what I want to do with my dog.  This is a drunken cry for help to be truthful but forget that. I want to stop and I feel sick. I have been stealing my dad's vape pen to stop cravings. I'm an ex boxer and  I'm determined to stop now. And I think I can do it but I also need to get my fitness back. I can't live like this. I've fought my whole teenage life and I hate to sound like a victim but it's so hard sometimes. Tell me if I sound like a dick cuz I feel like one. But my rant basically is I want to stop this habit. I want to be able to take my dog up the local hills and run around and enjoy myself. I know now I have pals who will help but the stress is too much. This whole lockdown thing never done anything good for my mental health and I've cut down recently too. Just any tips or support to finally kick this habit and get myself back on the right road would be appreciated. I'll probably shorten this tomorrow and take 99% of the drunken bullshit but for people who have stopped I would love to know how you did it. I think I have the will and the social support but I need to dedicate myself to something to keep me busy. I've been running recently. Keeping myself distanced from people and exercising and just want to know if there's anything people here have done to kick it for the long term. The temptation is real sometimes and it gets tough cuz my parents are both key workers and their chances of getting the virus are higher. I worry for my family and recently have been abusing substances to try and block it out. Mum is a dedicated and experienced nurse and it may not sound like a big deal but my dad delivers mail every day and is at risk of this disease. I just want to stop now and get out of this virus healthier and happier than when I started. I've hurt myself out of stress and became depressed with self harm being another coping mechanism. I'll repeat this is a drunken rant and will sort it out. This is a cry for help and some advice to kick this habit. I want it done to appreciate life with my dog and family. My family love me and my dog however stupid is one right kind soul. He loves us all and I want to offer him and my whole family a better me to support our whole family unit and get through this hard time. If you read all this bullshit rant but I'm just having a shit time of it. I think I can get through it but would love some support and advice to get myself sorted and achieve what I've been working towards for the last 3 years. Thanks for reading guys any advice would be appreciated,2,3

I‚Äôm 24 and was smoking a half-pack a day for the last 6 years. Decided to quit since being isolated means I don‚Äôt work or drive atm, which were my main times to smoke.

I would smoke 2 on the way to work, a couple more at work, another after work with my colleagues and a few more going back home. Being stuck at home has made it much easier to quit. If I was still working there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôd be able to do it.

So, I hit the 2 week mark today and I‚Äôm very proud of myself. I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd get this far. But, the cravings as of late are bad. I assumed the cravings would be at their worst during the first few days, but they are worse atm. 

I‚Äôm trying my best and I‚Äôm sure I can do it. Only thing is, once lockdown is lifted and I go back to work, I KNOW I‚Äôll go back to smoking. I know I shouldn‚Äôt but I will.

Was anyone else having bad cravings even weeks in? I feel like they should have gone by now...",8,1

699,2020-04-08 16:53:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/fxenjg/thank_you/,Thank you!,"I would like to start by expressing my gratitude to this forum and all of its participants. From the ‚Äúthis is my first non-smoking day (for the tenth time)‚Äù to the five year champions who came back to tell their story of how it will get easier with time. You were ALL extremely important in my journey to recovery and a smoke-free life.

I started smoking in my mid-teens. Just an occasional smoke once or twice a month during school recess. It escalated once I hit my late teens and was actually able to purchase smokes on my own. The occasional cigarettes very sneakily grew to be a pack a day habit. 2 packs during summer while drinking was nothing (except on my throat the next morning). This went on for the next decade.

I dreamt of quitting. I would talk about it with my friends and colleagues during our smoke breaks. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll stop after the summer, it‚Äôs too difficult when you spend most of your time outside and the temptation is there anyway‚Äù. Excuses after excuses from all of us. I have only encountered one person in my life who didn‚Äôt want to quit. 

I had a serious go at it few years in, when one of my best friends (also a serious smoker) told me he had quit a few months ago when he went to study in a different city.  I was jealous and decided to try it myself, but I was destined to fail. I didn‚Äôt have my heart and mind in it. I went without a smoke for a month or so and was really proud of myself. Here‚Äôs the catch. As a reward, I decided I could have a single or a few smokes when drinking during the weekends. No big deal! You all know how this ends. Before long, I was back to my old habits. A pack a day, no exceptions. This left a bit of a mark on me. I thought I could just simply quit if I put some effort towards it. I knew I couldn‚Äôt go at it half-assed again.

Early 2017 I finally took the plunge and boy was I in for a ride! The idea of quitting had been lingering in my mind ever since the last attempt (6 or so years), I just kind of knew I wasn‚Äôt ready (another excuse, but also a valid one). It all started one day at a grocery store. In my mind I was complaining about the expensive prices of steaks and decided to buy something cheaper instead. At the cashier, as usual, I requested the 6,50 ‚Ç¨ pack of cigarettes. Once I packed the groceries, I literally lost my mind. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck am I doing! I‚Äôm being stingy on food and at the same time I‚Äôm burning money every single day!‚Äù This drove me crazy! Then I finally had the revelation, I need to quit and now I have the motivation and passion for it. Not even to save money, just because fuck cigarettes and this addiction!

That night I hate smoked most of the pack and threw the rest of them away when it was time for bed. I felt content, but at the same time I knew it was going to be hell. I decided to search for information online, just a tip or two. I had heard of the Allen Carr method but it didn‚Äôt really resonate. Then I found this group!!! I read for hours and hours. Stories of success and failure. All of them inspirational. One sentence of a wall of text, it didn‚Äôt matter because all of them mattered the world to me. I knew I wasn‚Äôt alone in this!

The next few days was a nightmare as one would expect and most of you probably know. What surprised me was the next few weeks and the physical toll it would take on my body. Loss of sleep, JESUS THE APETITE, bleeding gums, fever (I don‚Äôt know if it was related), you name it. One thing kept me on track: this forum!!! I kept updating the site and read every single post and comment, some of them multiple times. I was a lurker (sorry about that), but it was my method at the time. 

What surprised me was the form of mental cravings I was having. I didn‚Äôt want to smoke right then and there. I was skeptical about the moments I grew accustomed to having and experiencing with a cigarette and if those moment would be as valuable without a cigarette: a morning coffee or a smoke after a really fulfilling meal. They just didn‚Äôt seem the same. This really frightened me. Would I fall into the same trap again as before, would I try to have just one now and then? I knew this would only lead back to smoking eventually even if I could hold out for a little bit.

First, I celebrated every day I went without a cigarette, then every week, then every month (I‚Äôm not sure but I think I stopped counting days at around 100 and weeks when I hit the half year mark). The summer passed and I experienced all the same thing as before, but now without a cigarette and looking back, they were all just as meaningful (I‚Äôm also not going to lie, some of them felt a little empty at first). The physical cravings fade as do the mental ones, but one thing I know even after three full years smoke-free: I can‚Äôt be an occasional smoker. It‚Äôs just not going to happen. Even though the smell of cigarettes became revolting over time, I know if I give it a finger, it will take more than an arm. 

Now I‚Äôm just rambling‚Ä¶ Thank you one more time, and good luck on your journey! If I could do it, you can too!",18,0

Help.,"I was smoking for around 10 years (since i was 16). It was the usual story, it was initially cool to do it with friends and was a crutch for anxiety and concerntration. It was expensive (going up to ¬£10 a pack, per day in the later years), and I was a constant and impulsive smoker. It affected my family relationships (my grandmother died of COPD). I would lie about it, and lived at home so it was obvious to my family, causing major fallouts. It affected my work, as I would go out for cigarettes every 2 hours, and if someone told me 'no' my mood was massively impacted. It was OK when I worked in bars, and sociable as all my friend's smoked and drank regularly, though I was often the driving force behind all of our habbits 'Want to go out for a fag?' always. I had full relationships that were based on our love for cigarettes. When I started in my profession post graduation, I would miss important calls, my boss would look for me, I would smell like fresh smoke in people's cars- and I spent over ¬£300 on smoking a month on fags. I was also generous with cigarettes, but always had to have at least 10 on me at any given time. Over-all, smoking was a big part of my life, and it became overwhelmingly negative. I quit for around a year in 2013, which took a lot of willpower- i counted the money i saved daily and used the NHS (Scotland) 'Smoking cessation' service, where i went in weekly, filled out a form, spoke with someone and had a breath test to check my carbon monoxide levels.  I started exersizing, and found that it made me feel good and in control. I was living away at university and had a great routine. I then relapsed via alcohol (a regular Scottish pastime) 'i'll just have one when i'm drinking' - i began having a post-work glass of wine just to have a cigarette. So I knew I couldn't go on like that and smoking became a constant again.In 2015 I purchased the 'Allen Carr Easy Way to Stop Smoking' book. It's concept is good 'keep smoking until you have finished the book' which was a lovely excuse to continue smoking until I was ready.  It took me 6 months to read the first half, then (with some mental preparation over around a month) I powered through the rest in one night, and had my final cigarette. As time passed, I was celebrated by family and friends for my perseverance. I called it 'the best thing I have done' and it was a real achievent. I used a quit smoking app and it gave me awards and told me things that were happening to my body: clearer skin, reduced carbon monoxide, lower chance of cancers, etc. I then broke my phone and lost all the data. Even the date I quit has become a distant memory. It's been 4 years (approx February 2016) since I stopped smoking. I didn't even think about it anymore. I could have a drink and didn't miss cigarettes. The smell was revolting, and most people didn't even recognise me as a smoker. The book taught me that I was a slave to cigarettes and ‚ÄúThe whole business of smoking is like forcing yourself to wear tight shoes just to get the pleasure of taking them off.‚Äù  It made sense- though the writing style of occasional 'CAPS LOCK' made me cringe. I have lived as a non-smoker, and it was the life for me. I've started my carear, been able to enjoy alcohol in a balanced way, had a great exersize routine and taken control of my life and finances. I talked about the book to anyone who would listen, and gave it away to a friend or colleague at some point.

I met my current boyfriend around 2 years ago in 2018, and he likes to smoke weed- he has chronic pain and functions well on it. I had never really smoked it, but was interested to try it. It was helpful with my anxiety and i found it mind expanding. We initially smoked it together irregularly, but it started to become a constant around 4 months ago. I would come in from work and have a joint, which obviously brought positives and negatives. I could concentrate on the TV and really enjoy documentaries and deep discussions, but I wasn't getting things done. I was feeling paranoid about smoking and was unhappy with my new routine. Soon it became harder to get up for the gym in the morning and I discussed wanting to stop- though there was no real catalyst. I still wasn't smoking cigarettes, though I would occasionally smoke a vape on nights out.

I went to a hen weekend in early March and brought a couple of joints, thinking that this would go down well with the crowd of girls I only knew marginally. No-one was really interested, so I took myself away and smoked them myself over the two nights. This took me away from the group, and made me paranoid.

Fast forward to March 16th. I started a new job on that Monday. I came home and smoked a joint, as usual. The I watched a TV show about Covid-19 becoming a Pandemic, and I had a full-blown panic attack. This was completely exaserbated by cannabis. This was my own doing, and I knew that I couldn't smoke it again for my own mental health. Two days later, my sister (who lives with my partner) and I got the virus. She called me at work to tell me, and I was advised to go home for 14 days to self-isolate. That day I had a glass of wine, and a cigarette. I tried to resist fulltime smoking initially, trying to vape and also purchasing some CBD to smoke instead. Though I had broken my mantra from the book 'I will never smoke another cigarette'.

So here I am, 21 days later. I went back to work for a couple of days and only smoked a vape a little during lunch, but had cigarettes at home. I have been steadily smoking rollups (which I have newly learned to roll) and that sense of failure has come over me. I go through the cycle of 'enjoy the cigarette- hate that i smoked it- try not to smoke it all- don't think about it- want to quit- then give myself a break, as it's COVID-19 and you can't beat yourself up'. I have smoked around 5 cigarettes since 09:30am, and its only 13:00 here.

Apologies about this ramble, but I don't want to go back to the way I was before. I've also been experiencing sore heads and drinking a lot of water while chainsmoking through-out the day. I'm also experiencing intermitent muscle weakness in my right arm, which I can only guess is to do with lower oxygen levels in my blood.

I feel like I've come too far to fuck up now. I know the cycle of addiction is that relapse is normal and that you just have to quit again and eventually it will stick. I am an addict, always will be. With that mindset I know that quitting and not smoking again is the only way to continue, however I don't feel ready, and I don't know how. I thought that posting here might be a start.

Thanks for reading if you got all the way through- any advice on how to proceed would be great. I know that lots of people will have similar stories and I would love to hear them.

With the looming threat of covid19 induced respiratory failure- I am feeling like I HAVE to quit. 

So I re-read (okay skimmed) Easyway again (for the like the 30th time) and the quit lasted 24 hours 2 weeks ago.

Still- covid19 doesnt give a shit that I am addicted so I  feel like I really, really need to do this- my life depends on it. 

So after talking with my doctor yesterday, he agreed to giving me a script for Chantix. 
Initially, I was excited- thinking ""maybe if I couple Easyway with Chantix, I will be able to get it this time and stay a happy non-smoker for good!""

However, after setting my quit date a week out and taking the first pill this morning, I am already feeling anxious and sort of jumpy. 

I am afraid of nightmares, and more importantly, sleep disruption- sleep is so important for a healthy immune system. 

And equally important. I am scared of the psychotic side effects- I am already struggling with being dumped and all the emotions that come up including the ego death pain, horrid, ugly-crying and a sense of never again being happy, much less as happy as I was with her. 

Is now a bad time to try this drug? 

I dont know what else to do and really really want to quit but my willpower sucks!!!

Im male, 46, and have been smoking regularly since I was in my mid-twenties. 

TLDR- got dumped right before pandemic lockdown, scared of covid respiratory death, want to quit (its just fucking time!) but scared Im already too emotionally vulnerable to not get worse side effects with Chantix.",4,7

I just wanted to let my body  catch a break and this seemed like the best time to do so. I had no intention to quit completely, but judging by the fact that I've come this far, might as well give it a try.

Right now I am not battling the physical need to smoke, but the psychological one. I liked smoking, I really did, and I always associated having a cigarette with something good for me. When i was bored, I went for a cig, when I wanted to relax, I went for a cig, when I wanted 5 minuted alone just to think, I went for a cig, when I wanted an excuse to get out of crowded area, cig it is. I miss the placebo that smoking used to give me, and although I know it is not good for my health, I don't think I will ever be able to completely quit unless my health forces me to.

I liked smoking a lot and I am thinking to myself: why did I stop smoking? I really enjoyed it. Why do I throw away something I like if I am not forced to? I want my 5 minutes of placebo back.

I am aware that my mentality is not good and that awareness kept me going for 3 weeks, but I feel like I will give up at one point in time and then repeat this cycle again. How do I beat the psychological need to have a cigarette?

I'm on day 7 and have been feeling all over the place, maybe someone can relate or calm me down.

The first few days of the quit was horrible, I was pissed at everything and anything (my poor boyfriend quarantining w me), had a headache all the time and was dizzy / brainfog. Right now, I feel like my actual cravings are way less but my anxiety has gotten to a point where I can not deal with it any more, I feel like I am losing my mind ?!

I've been experiencing the tingling hand sensantion, but also a dull pain in my left arm. I sometimes feel pressure on my chest (I feel like I can 'feel' my lungs if that makes any sense) and feel like my heartbeat is out of control. 

I've been crying and at times difficulty breathing (i'm over-focused on my breathing i think). I called my docter since the arm pain was worrying me, he allowed me to come for a visit (right now they only do skype calls mostly). He took all of my vitals and the only thing that is wrong with me is a hightend heartbeat, he said my lungs are perfectly fine and i'm experiencing high anxiety. 

Tough i've delt with depression and social anxiety in the past, this is something completely new to me.

He prescribed me with two calming meds, and I have yet to feel the effects.

The docter was kind enough to reassure me that, right now, high anxiety is something a lot of people are dealing with. Can someone relate while quitting smoking? Do you have ways to cope? 

I honestly, na√Øevly thought I would feel better at this point but feel like absolute crap 24/7.

Tomorrow I would enter the 3rd and last phase, where I'd be putting on the 7mg nicotine patch for 2 weeks.

I am currently on forced leave and just enjoying my time at home with my partner. So no stress really, maybe just a bit of boredom.

I was wondering if I should just skip the last and final stage of the patch and try cold turkey? I will be back at work next week and my theory is that I'll get the worst symptoms that might occur out of the way while I'm at home. I'm worried and a little scared though because the last two days I haven't felt as confident as I did in the beginning of my quit.

Should I continue the NRT? Do any of you have experience and tips for me? How does it feel without the NRT? Is it going to be like when you first quit cold turkey?

A little bit of a different position I am in, but just as terrible! I have been mixing weed with tobacco out of a bong for about 3 years, 24 y.o. now. I'd say every 3 weeks I buy one of those $20 pouches of American Spirit and mix it with a Q oz that I finish once a week (a gram a day give or take). I'm not concerned about quitting weed, but just these stupid spliff rips. I literally keep telling myself I'm not even getting high anymore, but for some reason I keep going back. Tobacco is not meant to be smoked out of a bong, and I can definitely tell. I cough up the grossest stuff, constantly am wheezing and can not run for longer than 5-10 minutes anymore.  I know this also sounds stupid but, I HAVE NEVER SMOKED A CIGARETTE ALONE. The whole reason I started this was because I was a broke college kid and thought in the long run this would save me weed. I have been ""mole"" free for 48 hours and I feel like SHIT. I was up the entire night, was sweating SO badly and now I'm just irritated. At max, I was smoking 3-4 cigarettes a day, but I'm convinced the bong is what is making it so hard to quit. Has anyone had any experience with this? Is it possible that smoking it the harshest way possible with no filter is making it harder for me to quit? Or am I just experiencing 1/5th the intensity as most of you, and being a baby about it? (Please be honest)",2,0

I never thought I would say this but it's honestly like I never smoked to begin with. I never think about cigarettes, and if someone is smoking near me I feel disgust rather than craving.
Took me a while to feel that way though, the first few months were hell. Then I slowly stopped thinking about cigarettes but would still get the odd craving, especially if I was drinking alcohol or around smokers. Eventually that went away as well, and now I can confidently and honestly say: I will NEVER smoke a cigarette again!

If you're currently going through it, just hang in there! Each day without smoking is a victory. I promise it will get so much easier, and that's coming from someone who smoked every day for a decade. 
My best advice is to try and find non-smoking friends (if you can), read Allen Carr's ""Easy Way To Stop Smoking"", try and find a hobby to keep you occupied and most importantly: Believe in yourself!

I was a 30 a day smoker for around 15 years, almost 50% of my life. Attempting a couple of times to give it away, my best attempt was probably 2 or 3 months with champix before a night out drinking while working away, thinking I was cured led me right back to where I was within a couple of weeks, hiding it from my wife for a while, which never ends well.  
In 2015 when my daughter was born I made a half ass attempt with Alan Carr's book, getting only around a third of the way through but was nervous about fatherhood and used it as an excuse to continue, ultimately failing before I began, making all the excuses until I didn't have to make excuses anymore.  
The whole time my non smoking wife has been brilliantly supportive without making me feel horrible.
When we discovered we were expecting another child I agreed to give it one more try, I was already not able to do all the things I wanted with my 2 year old daughter, a physical job kept me relatively fit but I could barely run more than a few seconds without being out of breath.  
My final attempt was with champix and a no nicotine vape that I used for a couple of months on and off, I tried to find distractions, learned to cube, but I had the motivation, determined to be better for my kids.  
Around this time I changed jobs, getting off the tools and into a stressful desk job, this has caused me to reconsider a few times, even still. I persevered and my son was born, enforcing my motivation and I have never looked back.  
Last week we all went for a ride together, even though sitting at a desk I have put on a few kgs, I have never felt healthier and so much happier that I am not the constant burden of my family.",58,0

I have some questions regarding mental and physical health concerns.,"So I didn‚Äôt smoke at all today. I‚Äôve smoked for 20-25 years. WAY too long and with everything going on right now I figured I would just do this once and for all. I don‚Äôt have any cigarettes at home, I finished the last pack last night. So I did ‚Äúalright‚Äù today. I did just lay around and feel depressed most of the day. But I think that‚Äôs to be expected day one. I quit for 3 years before and this seemed par for the course. Now on to my questions... 

I‚Äôll start with that one. How the hell do I minimize my depression associated with quitting? I feel like someone robbed me of something.

Next question. I recently got diagnosed with ADHD. I instantly noticed today that my brain is all over the place. I‚Äôm having a very hard time concentrating. That together with my mild/severe OCD makes things extremely frustrating. It‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt pay attention to anything but if I don‚Äôt remember what took place I‚Äôm beside myself. Is this because nicotine is a stimulant? And I‚Äôm now lacking it? I now can‚Äôt go to therapy due to the virus. I certainly can‚Äôt get to see a new doctor to try meds. 

The last question is little weird. Apparently nicotine helped me keep regular. Now it feels like I‚Äôm backing up. Not constipated, but things are not optimal. Any idea of how to give me that smoke a cigarette and ‚Äúwow, I have to shit‚Äù feeling?

Successfully quit benzos which actually wasn't too bad, currently trying to quit amphetamine, and of course, currently trying to quit nicotine. The amphetamine withdrawal is brutal, but if I have nicotine by my side it's usually still tolerable. But every time I try to quit nicotine, my brain goes ballistic. I actually get panic and anxiety attacks along with waves of depression, stress and irritibility.

I don't know if it's because of the magnitude at which I smoked (whether that was a Juul pod a day, a pack of 20 cigarettes a day or an entire puff bar within about 4 hours) or what, but I absolutely break down every time I go awhile without smoking or vaping. I don't know what makes this withdrawal as cruel as it is, but they say that this stuff is harder to quit than heroin and I can see why.

I'm currently trying to wean off of it. I don't know if cold turkey is the better option though (from what I've heard it is for some reason), but I just hope this works. I'm keeping track of and tallying how many times I'm hitting my Juul a day, and each day hitting it no more than the day before.

I‚Äòm 22 years old and quit smoking 9 days ago. I used to smoke 15 cigs / day for the last 7 years. I quit cold turkey.
 
Things started to get out of hand when I started uni.
I‚Äòm a med-student and seeing all the patients in the emergency departement really scared me. Not so much to convince me to stop smoking though. So ironic.

I come from a strict household and smoking is strictly forbidden in my family so i basically always had to smoke without my parents knowing. When I went on holidays with them I wanted to go have a smoke in the middle of the day without them figuring it out. It stresst the shit out of me. Because I had my freedom at uni, I smoked so much that I really had to change my behavior. I don‚Äòt want to be dependent on fucking cigarettes ever again. 

So anyways, the first 3 days were the real pain. Withdrawal at its finest. I have to study for exams but all my mind was thinking was cigarettes. I couldn‚Äòt concentrate, it‚Äòs like I was in trance surrounded by cigarettes. My dreams where so vivid all the time, my mom
Told me I started screaming in the middle of the night lol. (Probably my body detoxing)

I‚Äòm feeling much better now! Really scared to relapse though to be honest. The evil voice still exists but I‚Äòm trying my best.
Nobody I know knows that I‚Äòve stopped
Smoking that‚Äòs why I‚Äòm soo grateful for this community here. I‚Äòve only recently discovered reddit and I‚Äòm fascinated by each and everyone of you! 
I‚Äòve also wondered how no one seems to be pissed off in this community, allthough one would think that‚Äòd be the case since most of us are trying to quit lol.

Anyways, thanks lads and lasses if you want to talk, my dm‚Äòs are open for you!

So, for the first time in my adult life I'm seriously considering quitting. I have been smoking for the last 7-8 years of my life (currently 28yo) and I am not really a hardcore smoker, aroung 10 cigs a day, unless I'm going out, which is when I can smoke a whole pack in a night. Because of that, I feel like it would be perfect to quit right now, since I'm not going out at all nor have contact with any other smoker (because quarantine, basically).

I've been doing some research and while I think I can manage most of the withdrawal symptoms (obviously this is me believing I can manage them, but actually have no idea) the fact that gaining weight is among the side effects is driving me crazy.

I only eat once a day, and managed to lose around 44 pounds in the last two years (by no healthy ways, tho) and while I don't actually know if I have anorexia, my low self steem and body issues are big enough as to be really mortified about the possibility, even when 5-10 pounds is not really that much, it is scaring the eff out of me. Also the fact that my metabolysm is gonna change and be slower after quitting and the posibility of recurring to food as a way to calm the cravings is putting a lot of stress on me, and haven't even quit yet.

Anyone here who went through a similar situation while quitting? I know I need to quit smoking, but the idea of be fat again causes more struggle to me that stop smoking itself and it's making the whole thing way harder than it should.

Also, if you are Mexican and know of organizations or hotlines to help with the whole quitting deal, I'd appreciate if you shared them with me. Internet is not being helpful and going to a clinic is not an option due to Covid quarantine.",3,3

Started going to the gym 4 times a week so that managed to reduce the smoking because I was busy getting ready for the gym, driving to the gym, etc. So the fact that I had to do all of that helped me get through the usual cigarette I'd have if I stayed at home.

Now because of the pandemic I don't need to drive around anymore. I ordered some basic home gym equipment to workout from home and keep my healthy routine, but I still smoke.

I went from almost a pack a day to 4-5 cigarettes a day, which is quite an improvement, but it's not something I'm proud of.

Worrying about my parents (who are at risk. My mother is a frontline nurse and my dad is a lung cancer survivor, has diabetes and takes medication for his cholesterol) so the cigarette I have ""reduces"" the stress (it's a fake psychological perception) and when I smoke I ""feel better"", but at the same time when I smoke I put myself down saying stuff like ""wtf are you doing smoking"".

I wanted to post here to see if anyone has any tips to get the cravings away. I tried drinking water, but that doesn't help. I tried focusing on something more specific like clean out my drawers, wash some clothes, etc but I still have that stupid craving.

Any other people in the same situation as me? Are there any mobile apps to help you stop smoking? Any tips would be appreciated I really want to smoke, but I keep giving myself excuses on why am I allowed to smoke another cig.

Initially it was just casually, when I was out drinking or with friends who were smoking. Then I moved to a new country and started smoking about a pack a day, which continued for a couple years. I managed to cut down, but never fully quit. For the last 3 years or so, it's been pretty casual again. On a bad day I smoke about 4 a day (only every couple of weeks), but there have been times where I only have a 2 a week. 

I'm definitely addicted psychologically. I treat cigarettes as rewards when I'm happy, but more often as a companion when I'm sad or stressed out. 

At nights there are periods I lay awake at night and can't sleep because I've convinced myself I can feel a mass in my lungs. I know it's anxiety but it's really tough to shake loose. Obviously I know smoking is unhealthy for me, but I regularly just get this ""fuck this"" attitude and really just want to smoke. 

I don't always feel like I want to quit, as once in a while a lil ciggie just feels amazing. 

I wasn't able to sleep most of the night as I was just having a big panic attack over my health.. I've never had any health issues, but this COVID thing sure isn't helping my anxiety.

I did quit for a few good stretches, maybe 5 years the first time and 3 years the second time. But what started as social ""only when I'm drinking"" smoking turned back into a habit. I've been smoking again for about 2 years, just shy of a pack a day. I've made a few half hearted attempts to quit again, without success. And I should know better, my Dad died from lung cancer caused by smoking. Even watching him go through what he did still wasn't enough to keep me from picking up the habit again.

I have so many excuses. My stress, my anxiety, I'm a stay at home mom so sometimes I just need that few minutes outside away from my kids. (I never let my kids see me smoke)

But now with coronavirus circulating, I'm scared I've damaged my lungs and if/when I get it, I'm going to die. My husband also has health conditions that make him more vulnerable to complications, and my most terrifying thought is leaving our two girls without their parents.

A few weeks ago I called my state's quit line. I got set up with their program and my phone counseling sessions. I got my nicotine gum in the mail, and for the last two weeks I've been using a timer system, gradually increasing the time, alternating between smoking and chewing a piece of gum. I've cut my smoking down to 6-8 cigarettes a day. The gum helps quite a bit, although I'm not a fan of the way it makes my throat burn.

And I just smoked the last one I had. The nice thing about self isolation is that I'm not going to be tempted to stop and buy at one of the 10 convenient stores I see on a normal day when I'm out running errands. I am really weak when it comes to resisting urges in the middle of a craving. I really think that being at home, chewing my gum, and not even having the option to buy is going to help me be successful this time around.

I'll do it for me, I'll do it for my girls, and for my husband. I want as many happy years with them as I can possibly get.",8,2

Worried I might miss smoking long after I quit. Happy about any experiences, motivation or other comments!","Hi everyone! I've been going through r/stopsmoking for a few days now and decided to register so I could share my side of things, ask for support and experiences and hopefully help someone else too when I've been at it for a bit longer. I apologize for the long post, but this feels like an incredibly supportive environment so I'd like to give a bit more background, if that is alright.

I'm 29 years old and I've been smoking for about 15 years now. At first a pack would last me a while but for probably the past 8-10 years I'd smoke between half a pack and a pack per day. The last time I tried to quit smoking, I was still in high school and it didn't go well - I started again about a week later when I first went to a bar again and had a few drinks (I live in Germany, hence the going to bars in high school part).

Since I started smoking at such an early age, most of my other habits and rituals that I started in my life are entangled with it. Morning coffee - light a cigarette. Wait for the bus - light a cigarette. Drinks - light many cigarettes. Bored - light a cigarette. Had a meal - light a cigarette. Sex - light a cigarette. You get it. It's also an avoidance mechanism for me. When I don't wanna do something, like if I'm procrastinating on a work assignment, I'll take lots of smoke breaks. My biggest trigger however (which might be the hardest to untangle because it's not something that happens very often) is when I take in a beautiful view, be it from the top of a mountain, a gorgeous beach or an amazing cityscape. The thought of doing that without a cigarette is weird.

Recently, more and more of my smoking started seeming like something I just do because I have to and less of something I enjoy. I used to really enjoy it (or at least tell myself that I really enjoy it) until a few years ago. There is still the occasional cigarette that kind of seems special, more often than not either in connection with coffee or with alcohol, but most of them feel like I just smoke them because I have to. Which is bad, because that just sends me into a spiral of shame and that makes me smoke even more.

Weirdly, I have no problem not smoking in situations where I know I can't. I can sit in an airplane for twelve hours and while I might think of smoking occasionally, it doesn't really bother me. I can also sit in a meeting at work for hours at a time and not smoke. But in situations where I can easily smoke, like when I'm at home (I only smoke on my balcony though), sitting on a caf√© patio with a coffee or going to a bar (in Berlin you can still smoke in many bars), I'll sometimes smoke half a pack in the course of just a few hours.

I'll often have a phase where I think of quitting, which just makes me stress and worry while I smoke for a few weeks and then I'll forget all about it again and keep smoking. But this time, many factors came together. The whole Covid-19 situation makes bad effects on my health seem closer than the abstract thought of lung cancer somewhere down the line. I've been doing Yoga on and off for a year and while I treat it more as a workout than mindfulness exercise, I have definitely been getting better at controlling urges and separating impulses and thoughts from what I actually want/think/believe. That makes dealing with cravings easier, I assume. Also, I've been starting to imagine the moment where I'm at an older age and get the bad news that I have some smoking-related health condition. How incredibly stupid must it seem in that position that you didn't just drop this garbage when you were younger. Additionally, we just had a health scare with my mom (luckily it wasn't anything too bad). It wasn't anything connected to her smoking, but this again made me think about how many people in my family smoked a lot and died early (late 60s, early 70s) of cancer. It was never lung cancer, but the smoking can't have helped.

I don't really feel the bad effects of smoking on my health yet, other than not having a great stamina. I don't wake up coughing in the mornings or anything like that. This is good of course, but it unfortunately makes the consequences seem further away. It might however also be that I'm really feeling the bad effects but since I've been smoking for so long I just have no clue what my baseline is.

I initially planned to give quitting a try, finish the cigarettes that I have lying around at home and then not smoke for a week to see how it goes. However, I still have two packs and yesterday thought that if I don't do it now I might find some reason again to not do it at all, so I started my experiment today with those cigarettes still lying around. I don't wanna tell myself that I will never smoke again, because this finality seems more stressful and harder to achieve than just taking it step by step. I like the experimental approach to things: do, observe, adapt. So I'm saying I do this for a week and watch what's happening with me in that time so that afterwards I can decide if I wanna keep going. Best case scenario is that I keep going for another week, then another week, and so on until I don't even have to think about it anymore. I also feel like I shouldn't throw away the cigarettes I still have lying around at home. I want to not smoke because I choose not to rather than because I deprive myself of the opportunity to do so, if that makes sense.

Today was the first day in a very long time where I haven't smoked a single cigarette (except for when I was sick). Generally, it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. I don't feel any physical withdrawal symptoms and I'm not really irritated or different from usual. I didn't have to work and I did a lot of walking, which helped. However, I constantly notice myself rationalizing why quitting wouldn't be a good idea or a voice telling me I'll never really enjoy my morning coffee, reading a book, taking in a view or having drinks again. This is where I usually would have given in and just lit a cigarette, but the little bit of mindfulness I have gained helps me realize that those are just passing thoughts and if I don't try to push them away, they'll lose their power over time. It's still not easy though. I'm guessing it will get harder before it gets easier. The physical part will be no problem at all I think, but I tend to rationalize and overanalyze a lot, also in other areas of my life, so the inner voice is the challenge here.

What worries me the most is not what the next days and (hopefully) weeks will be like, even if those will definitely be a challenge, but that the little voice telling me that I will miss smoking forever might actually be right. Some members of my family have started smoking again after decades of abstinence shortly before their death because they felt like at that point it wouldn't make a difference anyway and they could just enjoy the time they had left. Heard similar stories in other families or read them about famous people. Does this mean that some (or many) people miss smoking so much long after they kicked the habit that they're just waiting for the time when they can start again? I'm really scared of the thought that even in one, five or ten years time, I'll have my morning coffee still thinking that it would be better if I could have a smoke with it and that something is missing. Isn't it perverse how this damn addiction can control your life for so long?

I would be happy about any experiences you could share, anything you find motivational or just someone who is in the same situation writing a few lines about how they feel and how their process of quitting is going. Any suggestions on things you found helpful, no matter how small or weird, are also very welcome. Please feel free to share setbacks and hardships as well - I know that it won't all be fun and games once the first three days are over and I'll never think about smoking ever again. Better to be realistic about it.

Thank you!",10,1

I am 34 and started smoking in the 8th grade (I think I was 13?) because I thought it would make me cool ü§Æ and never even considered quitting until I got pregnant with my now 9 year old. 

If I‚Äôm being honest, I loved smoking and didn‚Äôt want to quit. Since becoming a mom tho I have quit a handful of times but it has never stuck and was never for very long other than my pregnancies which I actually used those as a countdown till I could smoke again ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

This time is different tho. I no longer want to smoke. I was finally ready to quit because my breathing was freaking terrible. I couldn‚Äôt say a full sentence without having to clear my throat and I was waking up gasping for air because I was literally not breathing. I sounded like an asthmatic with all the wheezing and genuinely just felt like crap all the time. Plus this time my SO and I are doing it together! We made a plan to quit after a wedding we attended back in February. 

This was of course before the stupid virus that shall not be named became a real threat so at the time we were just quitting because we wanted to feel better but then all this craziness happened and the want to quit quickly changed to we HAVE to quit. 

Having this pandemic happen at the same time has been surreal. The anxiety that I normally experience when quitting has been tripled and my stress levels have skyrocketed but it has also helped me in some ways. Being isolated away from any smokers and knowing that this virus attacks your lungs has made it a little easier and has made it to where I honestly (mentally) don‚Äôt even want one. 

My relationship is definitely being tested with all of this as well. He was a 2 pack a day smoker while I was at 1 pack a day. I quit cold turkey while he is using 4mg mints so while my nerves have been out of control he has mints to calm his which for some crazy reason drives me nuts. On top of that, we have been isolated with our 9 and 7 year old boys for 19 days now... Needless to say we have been on different pages for weeks now. 

Thankfully we are giving each other space to just deal with all of this in our own way. On day 2 of quitting we both agreed that whatever happens in the next few weeks doesn‚Äôt count and we both know we love each other and will get through this and man has that been true! 

Day 23 today and I am thinking we are finally getting somewhere and finding some sort of normal. I have found that the achievement dates are weirdly the hardest days. Yesterday was 3 weeks officially and instead of feeling good and proud my anxiety was out of control and all I wanted to do was curl up in a ball all day. It‚Äôs weird to me how this happens because I seriously have no interest in smoking but my body still goes through these anxiety ups and downs and I know it‚Äôs from withdrawing. I truly wonder if this will this ever end? 

To help get me through this I‚Äôve had a few things I‚Äôve done that includes finishing up a few home projects I had going, drawing zen doodles with my kids to keep my hands and mind busy, breathing deep when my body starts feeling like it might explode, and curling up in a ball while zoning out watching tv or scrolling here when all else fails. 

All in all I am feeling pretty great right now. My energy levels are up, my lungs feel good, my attitude is much nicer, the anxiety is settling (at least for today lol) and I‚Äôm am genuinely happier then I have been in a long time. 

This forum has been amazingly helpful! Its nice to be able to vent and I am so thankful to all of you for your words of encouragement and stories of solidarity. Day by day, minute by minute, we will get through this!",54,3

So, I quit 10 days and 16h ago after smoking for almost 11 years. I still do get cravings sometimes, but nothing that I can't manage... Tho, I am wondering when will I start feeling better ? I wanted to vomit for maybe 30min yesterday. (But, didn't) I feel tired and omg... the brain fog is just killing me... Might be due to the fact that I've been waking up at 4am for the past few nights... Tho, I do fall asleep again in 1.5h. I'm still pretty moody aswell.

I do exercise at home every 2nd day and I'm even starting to enjoy it. And I'm taking hot baths, which I believe help me feel a bit better.

Oh and I live with 2 smokers, who smoke in the house and they won't go outside to smoke, already tried asking them... But, it doesn't bother me THAT much anymore.

I've read that it can take up to 45 days for the physical withdrawal to subside completely.

Oh and I did quit weed almost a month ago and I was a pretty regular smoker for 5 years (with brakes ofc)

Any advice on how can I start feeling better ? And visiting my family doc isn't an option, well at least for the nearest future, because of the Pandemic.",3,1

I‚Äôm 20 year old f from the Uk and have been smoking 5-6 years, and smoking weed almost daily for 2 years, I recently have began seeing the staining on my teeth and for a few months I have really wanted to stop, but my willpower is little to none. I am so easily influenced so when the unfortunate Covid19 came to the UK and we went onto lockdown I realised this is probably the best time for me to really try
My mum and dad don‚Äôt let me smoke at home anyway so already, I knew it would be hard to smoke here
So far it‚Äôs been 10 days without weed, which for the last 12 months at least I haven‚Äôt gone a day without it, I got so dependant on it so to see myself actually living completely fine, better infact and feeling fresher in the mornings has been amazing and I‚Äôm so proud of myself, even though I know it‚Äôs mainly because I haven‚Äôt had the chance to it‚Äôs made me realise I can do this, and it‚Äôs put me in a better state of mind
Now it‚Äôs my 5th day without a cig, I thought I‚Äôd lose my mind, I thought I‚Äôd get snappy, I thought I‚Äôd give in but because I‚Äôve not left the house and kept myself occupied with Netflix and other things, I feel like I‚Äôve already began losing that craving. 
I‚Äôve had a full 30g pouch of tobacco in my bag for this entire quarantine, but because I‚Äôm unable to smoke here it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs not even there 
If your struggling (which I would 1000x more if I was able to smoke here or was around other smokers) make a change, get rid of the cigs, social distance away from family members/friends who you live with that may smoke, and block any sort of contact that will encourage you in the crucial first week or so, and going forward it should make things easier
Sorry this is a long post guys! I hope your all safe and well xx",15,3

I think you have to envision the place you were in. That place where you can't go a few hours without it, where you'd compromise yourself to get a smoke. You arent really yourself. The smoke makes your decisions, and it hurts. 

Down the track, you might crave it, you might feel like you need it, but you arent bound anymore. You can make the call. You arent a zombie to the addiction.

Craving is not the same as being stuck. Keep at it.",7,0

I received a DM from somebody who read an old post of mine when I was struggling desperately with brain fog and anxiety and it dawned on me that I barely even remember it at all. Had to look back at some posts to really get a glimpse into how my mind was operating at the time I quit. I quit after having a massive panic attack / nervous breakdown. It was a wild ride. I was afraid, confused, couldn't concentrate and I just KNEW it would never end for me... But it did.

&#x200B;

Well guys, I just want to do my little 'good deed' and remind you all that it WILL get better. I absolutely forgot that I even quit smoking.. It's so incredibly rare that I even think about the fact that some former me used to smoke and was afraid to quit. How nice that I could get away with decades of self abuse as quickly as I did.

I know 2 weeks feels like it will never pass before the ""over the hump"" we all wish for starts.. 4 weeks sounds like eternity when you're a few days out, and your 1 year badge of honor looks like it's out in some distant eternity that no craft could ever reach... But guess what.. BOOM. Almost 4 years  for me already.. Like a dream.... Unfortunately quitting smoking doesn't slow our short stay on planet earth down any.  Here I am nearly half a decade older and the sufferings of my quit are a distant memory.

I know it sucks right now. It's hell. Nobody knows what you're going through. I just want to tell you to keep it up. Bear this cross for just a little longer and you'll be free from the perpetual burden of being a smoker. Being a smoker is to suffer, suffering constant withdraw every 20 freaking minutes, so you light up and go through it over and over again every single day. Quitting is to be free of that. Quit so you can have a better life and so that those who care about you can have you around for this short stay in humanity for a little while longer. Quit so the impressionable children around you don't think it must be OK to smoke because you do it too. Quit because you quitting may inspire others to quit -- You could save somebody's life. At least 2 members of my immediate family found the guts to do it after they saw I survived, and they're long term former smokers now too. I'm very proud.

""As a former smoker"" (heh, I just said that), it does touch me when I hear of the successes of others. I know it's not always easy and that John Q. Public may not gives the slightest crap about how you feel, but YOU will know your achievement and be proud. Those of us who made it to the other side will be damned proud to have you on our side as well.

(The cool mint are my favorite.) It is getting scary seeing all the younger people die from COVID-19. I am pretty sure I have asthma and smoking does not help my case. I am self isolating myself and have 13 more days. Hoping that I did not catch this nasty virus in any of the three airports I went through. If anyone needs a reason to stop the virus was enough for me. I know its not easy but this community has helped me a ton and I give you my sincere thanks. We will all get through this together.
