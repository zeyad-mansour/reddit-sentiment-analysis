11,2020-10-30 15:02:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/jl2yce/what_has_worked_for_you/,What has worked for you?,"I was hoping someone could give me some tips and tricks of what has specifically worked for you when it comes to not smoking.  I realize there is a wealth of knowledge on here, and I'm going to continue to check the page, share in our collective misery, and attempt to do better when I get the urge.  

Some back story here, because I feel it's needed and I may not be your average pack a day smoker.  I'm 32 years old, and have been smoking on and off for 10 years.  Did not have my first cigarette until my senior year of college, and used it to get by during my last hectic semester.  Following this, did not smoke for quite a few months until I taught English in the Republic of Georgia.  For those who don't know, smoking (and copious alcohol consumption, 'chacha moonshine') seems to be a big part of Georgian men's lives in the villages (simply an observation; I love Georgia).  I wasn't a Georgian man unless I partook, and got hooked.  Fast forward to coming back to the states - I would go weeks or months not smoking, and then stress would have me crack and I'd get a pack.  It waxes and wanes these days.. I'll have months of success, and then months where I'll get a pack a week.
 
Generally, I'll smoke if I have drinks.  It's brutal - no inclination to smoke for a week or two at a time and then I'll have some crispy bois and the urge kicks in and won't let go.  Sometimes I'll refrain, other times I'll cave immediately.  The same scenario comes into play with stressors/work.   I have gone 6 months in the past without smoking, and then something at work will happen (both good and bad!) and I'll crack; all progress lost.  This absolutely kills my mental health.  It's ingrained in me, and it sucks.  How to break the cycle though?  

I'm committed to quitting now, which is the biggest thing I have going I believe.  I've bought the patches and an e-cig, and I'm ready to go.  I just don't want to fall into the same old trap this time, that I've found myself fall into in the past.  How do you guys go out of your way to make sure the relapse doesn't happen?  I've also got a good friend on dial to tell me to cut the shit out, when I get the urge.  

I'm at a loss here as to how else to set myself up for success - any advice would be much appreciated.  I think it may be a mental hurdle I need to get over.  

PS greatly appreciate whomever reads the above wall of text.  If nothing, it was therapeutic.",6,0

Did you know after smoking you exhale CO at higher levels because of increased blood concentration? That means even if you dont smoke in the home or around a baby, you're still breathing poison in their face for hours after smoking. Ive learned a lot since quitting. I always knew it was terrible for you, but having an understanding of what the risks are has helped motivate me to stay away from it.

When smoking cigarettes when I wake up I want nothing more.

Contrary to this when using a vaporizer when I wake up I don’t puff for hours.

I saw an interesting video a while back that shows the nicotine in the blood spike extremely high and then go super low (with cigarette smoking).

Vaping (regular vape cause nicotine salts also cause the same spike as cigarettes) allows the nicotine to enter the body slower and stay longer, thus avoiding the nicotine roller coaster of going up and crashing.

Has smoking weed caused damage to your gums? If so what are you doing to take care of your teeth? (Besides just brushing and flossing).

Are there any suggestions on preventing damage to your gums and teeth from smoking weed? Like is there any type of hack or products out there that can be used?

I wish that some type of mouth guard for smoking existed where it prevents the smoke from hitting your teeth and gum line. Or perhaps some sort of smoking filter that catches the buildup from the smoke.

26,2020-10-29 23:10:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/jkp52z/using_nac_to_crush_cravings_long_post/,Using NAC to crush cravings (Long Post),"NAC or N-acetyl-cysteine is one of the non-essential amino acids, part of the protein family. It is used for a variety of different conditions and instances like an Acetaminophen overdose or treating liver health. You can buy this supplement at the health store or pharmacy for relatively cheap. 


https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5241507/

Now obviously liver health isn’t going to help you quit smoking though having a healthy liver will. What’s interesting about NAC is it has the ability to not just help the liver but treat bipolar disorder and schizophrenia as well. In fact it is often prescribed for these conditions along with therapy and actual medication if needed. 


https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2018/2469486/

Now you probably learned this in high school biology but it’s got to be covered because it’s crucial. 

We have both GABA and Glutamate receptors in the brain. You’ve heard of GABA probably from learning how alcohol works, and you’ve probably heard Glutamate from “Mono-Sodium Glutamate”. Both these neurotransmitters work together to stabilize and excite the brain when needed. These two chemicals are so powerful they work and control the entire Central Nervous System, a single neurotransmitter having total control. GABA being inhibitory and slowing down the receptors whereas Glutamate speeds them up. 

When you smoke cigarettes Nicotine binds to both of these receptors after fitting like a puzzle piece into another stimulant- like neurotransmitter Acetylcholine but that’s not important for this post. Upon binding GABA is released making you feel calm, Glutamate is manipulated making you alert and because there is a vice versa relationship between GABA, Glutamate and dopamine- Dopamine increases in the brain as well making it rewarding. 

NAC reduces activity in the glutamatergic region, reducing glutamate output. This is important because the basic theory behind the cravings is Glutamate output. So as you can probably already guess, using NAC reducing Glutamate activity when smoking helps with the cravings. In fact most drug cravings occur from glutamate dysfunction, with the probability of low GABA. 

-https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5993450/

So my personal experience with NAC has been great. I preach it on another subreddit for mental health and people like it. My suggestion on how to take this supplement is take it halfway through your smoke or at the end. You will notice a calm kick in as the Glutamate is reduced, if taken too early the nicotine will for surely overpower these effects with its potent binding action. The longer you take it the better it works with the those stubborn cravings at certain moments, like after eating or when waking up. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6328917/

NAC is a non-essential amino acid that can treat acetaminophen overdoses and help with psychiatric disorders. It has reliability that it can help treat smoking and addiction disorders. Part of this is through reducing Glutamate output that excites the brain and causes cravings. I wish you all the best of luck on this journey.",3,0

About another week later we meet up and a friend walks by who smokes. She sits down with us and my friend asks my permission if she can smoke one.

I NEED YOUR HELP TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. I'm creating a vape that is designed to wean addicted users off so that when the finally do quit ""cold turkey"", their withdrawal symptoms aren't terrible, but manageable, which hopefully will decrease the rate of relapse, and increase success rates.

It would be a disposable vape, like many others on the market, but be restricted and decrease in “puffs” allowed per day until zero. For example, on Day 1 , you might be allowed 100 puffs. Once you hit 100 puffs for that day, it automatically shuts off and doesn't turn on until the next 24-hour block. The next day, only 90 is allowed, then 80 the next day, and so on.

Additionally, it will have an LED screen showing how many puffs allowed are remaining for that day and the time before it resets. This will allow the user to finally be able to track and manage their puffs throughout the day, gaining mental/psychological control over their addiction, while the restricted step-down method will help the body adjust and prepare for a quit.

SO, the reason I'm telling you guys is because the product is almost finished and I entered Redbull's Innovation challenge. If I win, I'll be able to get the resources and capabilities that I need to finish development, get the product out to you guys, and be able to help thousands, if not millions, of other suffering addicted vape quit. **Please vote for my idea/product by going to** [**https://basement.redbull.com/en-us**](https://basement.redbull.com/en-us) **, searching ""Rip Ranger"", and voting for my idea.**

I really think I can win this and help millions of lives, but I just have to get through the first round of voting which ends in **1.5 DAY**S!!! PLEASE SUPPORT, VOTE FOR RIP RANGER [here](https://basement.redbull.com/en-us), and THANK YOU!!!!

I mix the two and then smoke out of a bong which gives a nice head-rush and sense of euphoria, however, i've started to black out and have seizures. I had two within a week of each other back in August and then another one happened yesterday.   
Each time: I lose consciousness, fall down and hurt myself, and then ""come to"" somewhere else - like my bed, the couch, etc. with no recollection of what happened to me or how I managed to get myself back inside.   
This is not only scary and disorienting, but it makes me feel depressed afterwards...   
I also had about a million tests done at the hospital and neurologists office and by all accounts i'm perfectly ""healthy"". I had an MRI, EKG, EEG, Sleep Test, bloodwork, urine tests, etc. and they all came back normal. I KNOW this is from my smoking habits. I just don't know how to quit. How to deal with the withdrawals. How to stay sober if everyone around me is smoking. All of it.

I am 35, male, smoker since i was 16, I quit already with 30 for a whole year and then in one Sommer holiday I met some nice people who smoked some joints (that had a tabacco in it) and i joined them and after a month I came back home and I was back on smoking cigarettes.. I remember saying: ""this is not good, but I know I can quit again so I'll quit again in a week, latest a month..."" Of course that turned into 4 YEARS! So I am very proud of myself that I made this step again, in my opinion puting that decision in an action is the hardest step. So I am on day 24, happy, excited, healthy, sporty, and never want to be a smoker ever again..but the crazy thing is...there are genuine moments where I want to have a cigarette or two with friends while we drink wine or coffee or just celebrating something nice. I wish I could have that 1-2 cigarettes at JUST SOME occasions and then not needing them anymore in everyday life. It was just for so long in my life that I still connect something relaxing, something calming about it, like kind of a beautiful ritual. I know that it was the NICOTINE withdrawal that was calmed when i smoked, and as a non smoker you don't have the cravings..but still..even the native americans smoked cigars as a special ritual..so yeah I guess I miss that ritual. Of course I don't want to go back being addicted and yes I am telling to myself: you don't need this, you are free, you want to be healthy, being with friends is the beautiful thing, not the cigarette itself, why would a stinking cigarette make this moment better? But I can't help it..It feels like it would make the moment even more special.. I know its not good for me, I am really deeply convinced, and even read Alan Carr, watched so many different videos from professionals or people with personal experience, even did a laser therapy to quit and payed so much, wrote personal commitments and reasons why i want to quit... like I really never want to be an addict again, want to be disgusted by it, and when I look at ashtrays, elderly smokers whose faces turned gray, all the deaths, all the smell, all the slow ugly duying instead of healthy dynamic, colorful life...all this..and i still miss it at moments.. what is wrong with me..how do I make it stop!? Yesterday night I almost bought a pack of cigaretes, but due to corona the shops are closed at night.. I felt like i didn't have control over me..

I debated about posting here bc I didn't want anyone fresh in their newfound freedom to read this and start...doubting themselves. Then I decided that this community is for anyone struggling, and I have been. 

&#x200B;

Quick re-cap, in 2017 I quit smoking for almost a year. I read Allen Carr's Easy Way and really opened my mind to it - and it worked. Well mostly, I did use the patch for 11 days but then took it off in the middle of the day on day 11 and was fine after a few months. The whole idea of 1% physical, 99% mental is entirely true! Well, I will just speak for myself...it was true for me. I started back thinking ""just one"" at a party and that ""one"" became my old pack a day habit back in full swing.  I kept putting off quitting until now..

&#x200B;

I decided to pick November 1st for my last quit. In my mind, I said ""hopefully my last quit"" and that's the thing - gotta get my mind right. Maybe even fall in love with the process. (I saw someone post that on the Smoke-Free app - and it's been stuck.) I decided on the date last night, and it is set in my mind. November 1st, 2020 - the first day of my freedom!

&#x200B;

Today I have already gone through some of the rationalizations and have laughed and cried. I wrote a little something and instead of going on and on I'll just put that below.

&#x200B;

I am an addict. I am a prisoner and only I have the key. Crazy, right? To be the jailed and the jailer. I hate smoking. I despise myself for thinking I need to put the expensive cancer stick to my mouth and inhale all the chemicals to feel ""normal"". I am tired of stinking like an ashtray and coughing up phlegm. I am so sick of waking up and having a 20 min coughing fit before I can even get my day started. Cigarettes are not my friend, they are not my enemy, they are a product of a billion dollar industry that I have allowed to brainwash me into believing I need the daily $6 pack. I have spent over $36,000 in my life on fucking cigarettes. That's a new car, or a very nice vacation or two. Hell, that's almost a modest house in the country. I have nothing to show for it except for my poor health. I am done. I am done making excuses for why I choose to light up day in and day out. I am done making the tobacco industry richer at my expense. I am done pretending that I enjoy slowly killing myself. I am done missing out on precious family time to go out and fill my lungs with more poison. I AM DONE! 

&#x200B;

Yes, I gave myself - mostly my mind 1 week to consciously smoke each one I choose to light. It's sickening. I imagine a brighter, better, more healthy life after I stub out each one. Open your mind and then recondition it. It is entirely possible. 

To everyone who has read and made it to this point, thank you. If you are just thinking about quitting, I suggest you look into getting the latest edition of Allen Carr's Easy Way To Stop Smoking. To those of you who have quit and just come here to post inspiration - THANK YOU! To everyone else, no matter where you are in your journey, try to enjoy it - as your body heals. Try not to think that you are losing something when in fact you are gaining so much.

Here's some of what has worked for me.,"20 days is about the longest I've gone without smoking since I last quit for about 6 months when my grandfather passed away 10 years ago from lung cancer. Since then, it's been a week here, 10 days there, but never sustained until now. And I'm committed to stay smoke free.

What's worked for me? First and foremost, not buying a pack. I realize that I have control over that element, and lack of access has been an extreme deterrent. I really don't know people who smoke these days, and even with those I did smoke with I'm pretty distant from them in our state of isolation. Having made this transition now will help a lot once the world opens back up a little.more. 

With regard to the isolation, this subreddit has been helpful as a ""community"" with whom I can surround myself. Even in these times of pandemic-related isolation, there's this group of people sharing their stories that inspires and encourages me to keep going. Please keep on sharing your stories, as I know there are countless others like me who will need the power of your experience to keep moving forward. 

On a physical level, nicotine gum has been helpful. I'm continuing with the routine so as to maintain a relatively consistent level in my system without cutting it down too soon. It's been just under 3 weeks so far and I think I can keep it up until the recommended reduction point. The gum has also been helpful as a replacement during my routines when I used to have a smoke while grabbing coffee, as a mid-day break, or an end-of-day walk.

Not to endorse a specific product, but the Smoke Free app has been awesome. The daily reminders with the Diaries and Missions have helped a lot. I'm actually posting to this sub for the first time on account of one of the missions. But for me, it's also the reminder on a daily basis of the health benefits from quitting a somewhat benefitless habit, and how my body is healing the longer I go without a smoke. These health benefits are my biggest motivator as I want to stay alive as long as possible to spend time with my soon-to-be-born son. 

Lastly, the memories of having kicked another habit by quitting alcohol over three years ago has been a benefit as well. Whenever I get even the smallest urge to smoke, I remind myself of the early days of that transformation and how it took time both to detox and also to change behaviors. After three years, I don't even think about alcohol any more, and I know that'll be the case with smoking one day as well.

Here's to the next 20, the 20 after that, and the days that string into weeks that grow into months and lead into years. I believe that I can make it.",11,1

I’m reasoning, that since I’ve proven I can get the attempts to quit off the ground like I have thrice this year, I’m able to do the hard work which is to actually get to 4,12 or 35 days and not smoke...so I’m thinking I can just give in now, retool, re-strategize and try again in a couple of months when I’m at least personally and emotionally in a better place, I can  handle the stress pressure and all that glitter but being unhappy is something I find drains a lot more energy to accomplish quitting...so I’m reasoning smoking for another 1-2-3-4 months long term will not change anything in my life....right?

I didn't have a cigarette since the 31st of December, although I've smoked a small amount of tobacco from joints (we mix weed and tobacco in Europe when rolling, so like one 5th of a cigarette goes into a joint).

I've tried to quit before but what was strange about this time is that I didn't have any cravings up until this week. 8 months passed with me having no cravings whatsoever and now I'm beginning to rationalize smoking and wanting to relapse. 

For the last two or three days I've been wanting to have a smoke more than anything and I don't know why is that. I've gotten drunk this year many times, I've drank coffee even more times, but I didn't have an urge to light a cigarette. And the fact that I get the urges now with no reason at all is killing me.

Might it be that I'm overworking myself these days? Or just because I'm feeling more stressed out than usual and the cravings are my brain telling me I need a vent? I'm literally rationalizing smoking thinking that it doesn't affect my lungs that much (even though I feel healthier than ever) or thinking that I'm not saving as much money as I've thought I'd save.

For my final project I am required to do community education hours, and especially because of current events, I am allowed to complete some online.

Our project is on the link between smoking in the home and the children in that home developing asthma. For the next 4 hours I will be available to answer your questions on our project.

[Here is a copy of our presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HSDqPnoFYlbuIx0OxqTa-deqUt62uXuq/view?usp=sharing) but the core information is that

* In a twenty year long longitudinal study examining the association of second hand smoke exposure amongst adults that have respiratory symptoms/conditions that was  released in 2019, it was concluded that “second hand smoke exposure in adults was associated with an increased risk for asthma and chronic bronchitis” (Flexeder et al.)
* “In a case-control study, reported that 67% of the 265 cases who were exposed to parental smoking considered that it aggravated their symptoms, and tobacco smoke exposure was considered a “significant factor” in 10% of children (16/ 158) where one parent smoked, and in 20% (21/107) where both parents smoked.” (Shachan)
* Adults who have never smoked recently exposed to SHS in a vehicle had higher odds of having current asthma compared with unexposed adults. (Nguyen et al.)

Then, when I turned 18, cigs became way more accessible (wasn't the legal age, but... I figured it out) and basically I don't know how I got here but I think by age 21, I became a pack a day smoker.  I quit briefly at 19 for a month because I got really sick, didn't smoke for a while and was like ah whatever. Then one day, I don't even think I craved cigarettes... but I thought that if I buy a pack it won't be like before and I'll smoke less. Turns out it was the opposite and as time progressed I smoke more and more... and now most recently, I often found myself smoking an entire pack in under 24 hours. Last week I had a surgery that affected my throat. Basically I had a really really sore throat.. but not like scratchy sore, it just hurt. I still had half a pack left and smoked half of one on my 3rd and 4th day of recovery. Then I smoked 2 or 3 each day following until I ran out. I haven't bought a pack since the day before my surgery, however, my mom (who I live with) is also a daily smoker. Sometimes I use patches... and they work.. for maybe 8 hours... then when she comes home from work late at night I'll snag 3 or 4 and smoke one before bed and then the rest throughout the following... even going so far as to clipping them just a little bit early so I can finish it later. Now I'm a marlboro person and my mom smokes newports. I fucking hate newports- I hate menthols in general. And I'm grateful that she doesn't smoke marlboro/non-menthol... because if that were the case, I'd probably be taking way more than I do. I'm so worried that if I continue this pattern... I'm going to crave more and more and eventually just start getting my own again.. either that, or I'll never truly stop. 

TLDR;

I'm just looking from input from some people who have had success by smoking less and eventually stopped... and also people who have weened down but never fully stopped/got back into their habits. Im not buying my own cigs because I know I'll go through that pack probably faster than I ever have before.  But honestly, any type of advice/input from anyone will be super appreciated. I don't want to keep smoking, I want to stop forever. It's disgusting I hate it. The smell, the way it makes me feel... and so much more lol. What should I do!",1,0

I started the day so strong! I was crushing this...10 days smoke free and 26 days alcohol free (the most days ever that I was clean.) I was listening and learning about that little addiction bastard in my brain. I have had cravings but was dealing with them damn well! Then my day got off track....

It started with the news and the virus. Numbers are rising and I live with my elderly mother who has been warned by her Dr that she is to isolate as much as possible due to her many health issues that make her especially susceptible to have a poor outcome if she were to contract the virus. She made the decision to cancel the Thanksgiving family dinner along with Christmas dinner because many of our family work in jobs that they are in contact with many people and they don’t practice social distancing much. Now, to some this may be a good thing...avoiding family and not taking part in the holiday craziness. In all actuality, I felt this might be a good thing for me and my recovery. My family sets off all kinds of mental issues for me and assists in my downward spiral with dealing with my emotions and addictions. However, for my mom it was a devastating decision.

As my mom was crying about cancelling the holidays I made my first mistake...I poured her one of those fruity frozen prepared drinks (one I had in the freezer from this summer). I don’t know why I did it...my mom doesn’t drink but a few times a year. Maybe I felt I needed it. I hate to see her cry and thought she’d like it, which she did. I had poured myself about 1/2 cup of it and drank that and all I could think was I wanted more. I didn’t have more but I wanted more. So there’s the first wrong move.

Then about an hour later,  I had to run to the store to get an ingredient for a dish I was making. Mistake #2. In the last 10 days of not smoking, I’ve learned that before I go down town I have to “prepare” myself for a trip to the store. I go through a number of steps to prepare myself to not stop for cigarettes. I didn’t think and just jumped in the car and drove to town. I didn’t get past the cig store. I bought a pack.

I ended up smoking 5 cigarettes 😢 Destroyed the pack and am not smoking anymore. Normally I would be hating myself but this time I am forgiving myself. I slipped and that is what it is. I have not given up on myself and will accept that I struggle with my addictions and am only human.

What I got from those 5 cigarettes....
1. A terrible headache
2. Pain in my sinuses
3. Chest palpitations 
4. Ass breath
5. Regret
**I have chosen not to reset my clocks as I don’t think I can handle the thought of seeing Day 1 again! Instead I am going to keep my days and always know there is a minus 1.

Didn't taper off. I moved to a new city and had to go into quarantine for 14 days. Perfect time to quit, I thought. I smoked a cigarette in the airport of the city I was moving away from and then went straight into isolation with two weeks worth of food, three packs of nicotine lozenges, and no cigarettes. I ate like crazy and sucked down a pack of lozenges but then I just slept and binge-watched the days away. Before I knew it, I was out of quarantine, covid free and a non-smoker!

I thought things would get easier but in all honesty, it has sucked and still sort of sucks. Physically, I've been coughing like crazy disrupting my sleep. I've gained weight. Feel like shit overall. Pretty sluggish and unmotivated. Mentally, the brain fog has dissipated but it's still been a struggle to get that same drive and focus that I had in between smoke breaks. 

Then out of the blue, I had a tough day around day 30. I had this intense craving for a smoke. I just wanted one. Was tempted to do one of those buy a pack, smoke one, and throw the rest away but thankfully that never happened. Then near day 60, I had another rough one. But I didn't want a smoke this time. Just missed cigarettes in general. I know it was weird. Ended up watching a bunch of youtube videos of people doing cigarette reviews and that was enough to get me through that day.

Then now, on day 88 out of the blue again, I got this huge craving. It just snuck up on me out of nowhere. And it fucked me up. I grabbed my car keys and thought about it for a second but then stopped myself. I was going to call someone but no one was around. Writing this down has helped a little. Switched my focus. 

I'm still glad that I'm not smoking for a wide variety of reasons. But for me, if I'm being totally honest, I don't feel all gung ho and happy and feel better about getting close to the three-month mark. I feel like shit overall. But then it dawned on me. Maybe I'm not supposed to feel great after quitting. Maybe this is how I'm supposed to feel.

Without the loss of my friend I can guarantee I would still be away from it. I can only blame myself of course, however. And it too is myself who must take on the torch and continue staying quit.

Wish me luck. This is day I guess 2 now. Day 3 or 4 always gets easier so if I can just hold out until then it'll be a lot easier.

I quit smoking a while ago because I was scared of my teeth getting damaged,  they already look terrible (in my opinion.).I used to enjoy smoking. I didnt smoke much (I know, every cigarette is factually too much...), like one before work, one after and on my days of maybe 1 or 2 inbetween. These were the ones I was looking forward to and they made me really feel better. When I was sad or stressed, cigarettes helped me to cope, because I have no people or anything else to turn to. I had no health problems I know of SO FAR. So those facts always kept me smoking because: nothing happened so it ""will not happen to me"" I still feel like that, but I dont want to relapse. Will that ever stop?Any ideas to distract or methods that make you feel similar like smoking? (Stress relief etc.). Sweets and similar foods aren't a good alternative for me :D

I've always been pretty emotionally/mentally static and I sleep like a baby. No very high highs, nor very low lows ... just mid range across the board. However, once I get to about 6 weeks post cig that changes. Here I am not sleeping well, I'm constantly dooown down, exhausted and extraordinarily negative and/or mad. I've always had at my disposal the ability to be positive through most challenges and a tendency toward happiness but that inclination has left me and I find myself trudging through my days suspicious and bitter and combative and annoyed by every single person around me. It is overwhelming.

 The idea of smoking again holds no physical appeal to me whatsoever; I'm incredibly turned off at the thought but in the back of my mind is this idea that if I do, at least I'd be done with this and life could go back to normal for me. 

I need some hope that this gets better on its own. This part of the detox has consistently been my downfall - it is especially pronounced this time and I've definitely broken from less.

If you think you're not an addict, you are lying to yourself. Stop fooling yourself. If we all could quit so easily, why haven't we done it a hundred times over?

I've been REALLY struggling with cravings this time around.
It may be because, initially, this quit was forced on me by not having any money left. As I quit, I did decide that it would BE a quit, but maybe somehow my mind didn't really ""get it"".

I got money again now, and let me say, this did NOT help my cravings. However, I think it may have helped my resolve, in the end.

I have made a card where I state that I now have quit, and that this is a promise, and I taped it to a door frame, so I pass it several times a day. It's like a promise renewal every time I pass it, and I've taken to ""patting"" it as I pass.

I live alone in a 54 year old trailer that was smoked in for decades. It made quitting extra hard, but I managed. I’m convinced that the residual smells are a constant trigger for me, but I don’t know. I’ve tried googling if it’s possible to have long term withdrawals but I haven’t seen much for nicotine, only drugs. 

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) reports 7 primary symptoms associated with nicotine withdrawal: irritability/anger/frustration, anxiety, depressed mood, difficulty concentrating, increased appetite, insomnia, and restlessness. 

Everything below is me at all times through out the day. A short version is, how your head feels after 2 days without a cigarette has become my existence for the last 2 months. 

I am incredibly irritable and angry for no reason.  I randomly have urges to freak out, scream, throw things, or punch a pillow. Fortunately I don’t, but it’s there. 

I’m anxious for no reason from the second I wake up, till I fall asleep. On a scale from 1-10 if a panic attack is a 10, I’m a 6 or a 7 all day. 

I don’t think I’m any more depressed than usual. I’ve lived with depression my entire life. 

Over the past couple months I have that brain fog feeling any time I concentrate on something, a lot of times I’ll forget how to spell a word and I feel like a deer in the headlights. I get super confused, and then extremely frustrated and angry because I know that I know how to spell(or do w/e it was) but I just cant. 

I snack a lot, wake up multiple times through out the night, and always feel like I’m fidgeting.

This is my umpteenth time trying to quit and I'm really determined to do it. I'm back at my family home working for a few weeks and I've used it as an incentive to get cig free. Been smoking heavily since I was 16, now 24 and, given all that is happening in the world, have now decided to really quit. I'm armed with a tonne extremely low strength e-liquids (3mg) for my vape, which has honestly been a god send (I used vapes and cigs in concurrence - cigs when I could smoke, very strong e-liquid vapes for when I needed my fix but didn't want to go out for a cig).

I have however been experiencing some really weird anxiety like attacks, breathlessness, insomnia and tightness of chest which I've attributed to quitting - very weird though as I've tried so many times before any ever really had this. That being said, never gone this long without a cig so maybe that is why... surely this goes away soon right? Because it's pretty unpleasant, and not fun to be functioning on minimal sleep or shortness of breath. 

Anyway, just rambling. I hope I'm at the peak of withdrawal now (or at least from my basic Googling, should be) - so fingers crossed, only up from here!

For some time I thought quitting was easy if you *really* wanted it. Allen Carr seemed to do it easily enough. His book gave me the idea that it was mostly a question of will. I did not read the book fully, however.

But my therapist this morning told me that nicotine takes years to leave your system and that people who have quit for 20 years can still get urges to smoke. This is discouraging. Daunting, even. If it takes that long, given the fact that my mother's already 61, I find the outcome of quitting at her age to be pretty bleak.

I also want to ask all of you who have quit or really want to quit, what made you change your mind? Had you always wanted to quit but lacked the confidence in your ability to resist temptation? Or did some event or experience in your life suddenly make the idea of quitting much more attractive/imperative? Or did you come to realize (maybe with the help of the book) that quitting *really* was easier than you'd been thinking?

I transferred over to vaping about 3 years ago, but I have realised recently that although I wasn't smoking cigarettes, I was now addicted to the process of vaping, having anxiety if this thing wasn't in my hand on a night out and I couldn't smoke.

Recently I quit nicotine for like 3 weeks and just smoked my vape with no nicotine, and it was great tbh, although the thing was glued to my fucking hand. Then I went out and drank and crashed a cigarette off my mate, and now hello darkness my old friend, 3 packs and 3 tobacco packs later and I fucking hate myself for it. I transferred back onto the cigarettes because I was now afraid of being addicted to the process of vaping, and I had also subliminally labelled the vape as a non-starter because I was so used to using it without Nicotine (if that makes sense?)

I really want to quit, but the anxieties come out to play, I get stuck in my own head, and fuck man I just hate myself right now for smoking again. If I'm on discord and hear someone spark up, I start to think ""I really wanna go smoke now"". I can't even tell my missus because I'm embarrassed by it. The worst demon too is that I am currently on a fitness journey, and I've recently changed my eating pattern but I am still getting to grips with that, but then when I quit smoking I find myself eating eating eating and now subliminally again, in my head, I'm like well you can't quit now because you're trying to get fit.

But alas, recently I damaged my rib so I've been on a healing process, so I can't work out or do anything, so now I'm just sat here thinking, fuck it I'll just roll another cigarette......

Does anyone have any advice? Did/does anyone else find that they're addicted to the process more than the actual nicotine? What advice does anyone have for drinking smoking?

Firstly I wanna say that I'm pretty new to this sub (3 days) and even in this short time I've read all of your stories about quitting smoking and I hope you (we) can do it. You have my support too.

It may seem a bit selfish to you that I want your thought on this one, but please hear me out.

I started smoking 5 years ago, when I was 15.  I smoke about 20 cigarettes everyday and since I roll my cigarettes, it is not that expensive for me (but still, it costs).

Three days ago, I thought whether I could go a day without smoking (which I've never done in this 5 year-period), I do not think that I should explain my experience with you since you know it all: It was horrible and it was really challenging. But since it was not that I decided to quit, I could just say myself that I would smoke tomorrow. Anyway, next day I woke up, and I did not want to smoke. But since I craved all day ( the day before) I smoked one. That day ( 2 days ago) I smoked 2 cigarettes and yesterday 3 (which is to little, I wouldn't believe myself 4 days ago, if someone told me that I would just smoke 5 cigarettes in three days without a reason) but I did not really feel good during/after smoking, I didn't feel myself dirty either, it was complicated like talking with an ex, not bad but not that good either.  Now I think about quitting since I understand that it could really be done, but I'm not sure. The thing is I think I can stop smoking but I do not feel ready to be a non-smoker, do you understand what I mean? 

I think the hard part is to be ready to be a non-smoker, it seems to me that only then you can achieve this seemingly-impossible task.

And it really is not just about how the people define me as a smoker, *I myself* identify myself as a smoker. It is very possible that I subconsciously think I'm cooler because I smoke ( like I said I started smoking at 15, I was just a child!), but the real reason is that over the course of years of growing I attached myself to the idea of being a smoker: When I'm alone at home studying, when I read a beautiful poem or see an amazing view or listen a song I like, I don't feel just the urge to smoke, *I think that I should smoke* **in order to appreciate the beauty of the moment**. I truely do not know whether I can overcome this obstacle.

I know this post is a bit different than I've read in this couple of days, and I truely am sorry if what I wrote is not  appropriate for this sub, but I really want to hear your ideas on this topic. Do you think that it is possible to quit smoking even if you don't feel ready to be a non-smoker, or am I just overthinking this process, or hmm I don't know, many of you went through these thoughts, which conclusion have you arrived?

So, I've made it past two weeks which is a big milestone for me.

However I have found that I am having a few beers to take the edge off, like after work or on a Sunday afternoon, more frequently.

I am trying to be non-judgemental of myself during this time insofar as doing weird stuff like eating a whole cake.  I want to get to a sufficient period where I can call myself a non-smoker and believe it. Thats my top priority. It may take up to 60 days.  However I have my eye on this beer thing because, y'know..

I'm 40F and I smoked around 1 1/2 pack a day for 10 years. Yes, dumb 30 yr old me started at a time when I should've known better! I quit last saturday and it's not my first time quitting (first in 2014 for 3 months, 2nd in 2015 for 6 months and again in 2019 for 7 months) but FOR SURE this time is the last because I'm fed up with all the hassle, short breath, bad smells etc. 
All attempts I went cold turkey.

I came to a point where I hate smoking so much I can't feel ANY cravings. I'm sleeping ok, didn't feel an increase in appetite. This time I'm just too scared for my health to worry about anything else.

Right now, I have a very dry throat and this sensation that something ""solid"" is stuck in there. I don't see any sores but the sensation when I swallow is terrible.
Also, I feel a painful spot on my tongue. It hurts like a canker sore but there's nothing to be seen there either.

I think I can fairly easily give up smoking but at the same time I can't, I'm not attached to the chemical side of it, I often go without smoking during the weekdays, managed to totally stop even for months several times without much effort, but I eventually go back (one won't be harmful and that is how it starts), I think my addiction is the ""act"" of smoking itself, for example I'm working a couple of hours and feel like going outside and smoke, or after having lunch, or to kickoff the day, or if I'm in a bar and feel like going outside. There are situations for me that kind of demand a cigarette and I think this is why it makes it very difficult for me to quit for good because it is like a constant reminder of how good it would be to just have one.

I belong to a small but growing group of dedicated tobacco harm  advocates seeking to put right the imbalance against vaping,  in particular government misadventure against those who vape. We're aiming   to grab  500K signatures  in support of our right for healthier alternatives to  tobacco smoking. We need your help to do so.

FYI  the Coalition of Asia Pacific Tobacco Harm Reduction Advocates (**CAPHRA**)    is an unfunded, independent, grassroots coalition of consumer advocacy  groups throughout Asia Pacific dedicated to defending the   right  to  choose harm- and risk-reduced nicotine alternative products.

We    are demanding that governments follow the science and create risk proportionate, public health centered legislation that will allow smokers to have all available options for nicotine replacement to switch  off combustible tobacco.

We   need  to stop negligent governments from tacitly killing its own    citizens by  allowing the product that is proven to kill one of every   two  users to  be available freely, whilst banning or severely limiting    access to  products that are at least 95% less harmful than  combustible   tobacco.

Regardless  of whether  you are a smoker, a vaper, or a non-smoker, like many of us advocating for change, the  chances  are  that you  have someone in your life who is at risk from  continued  smoking if  safer alternatives are not accessible and  regulated.

If you can help, please google CAPHRA for more information, or go straight to our [petition found here.](https://caphraorg.net/petition/)

I quit them by buying a vape and using that to get me off cigarettes. I was intending on using the vape for only a month or so, and then give it up, but here we are, 11 months later and only now am I actually doing that. 

&#x200B;

For the first 9ish months I kept making excuses to justify continuing to vape to myself. Like the fact it is cheaper than cigarettes, it's apparently better for you, along with many other things I told myself to justify not quitting. Then about 2 months ago I decided that it was time to quit, so I started getting a lower level of nicotine each time I purchased vape juice. Then yesterday was the big day, the day that I finally ran out of my last drop of vape juice that contained nicotine and now I am trying to be completely done with nicotine for good! I purchased a bottle of 0 mg nic. juice for my vape so I can still use it to kinda feel like I am getting some nicotine even when I'm not.

&#x200B;

It's been a little over 24 hours since I last had any nicotine and so far it hasn't been horrible. Surprisingly, I am nowhere near as angry as I expected I would be. Normally when I would go 1+ hour without using my vape (or without a cigarette when I was a smoker) I would get very irritable and completely full of rage, but it's been over a day and I am not angry at all. I feel more depressed than angry. Not for any particular reason, I just feel really down, which I'm assuming is do to my body going through withdrawal. It's not too intense of a feeling so it's manageable.

&#x200B;

There is another symptom that I am experiencing that is becoming more and more profound and more annoying as time goes on. Brain fog. It's kinda like the feeling you get after you have 2 beers. That feeling when you are in no way drunk at all, you just feel a tiny bit ""not sober."" And also kinda feel a little numb. I looked this up and it's apparently really normal for people to experience it when they quit nicotine, but I was wondering, how long does this typically last? It is very uncomfortable and I would like for it to be gone as soon as possible.",5,0

And that day came and went and I had 16 more years of them. Managed to slow down, speed up, go intermittent and then I quit. Here's how:

First off my mom died of (unrelated to smoking) esophageal cancer. On her death bed she told me not to smoke anymore. I was down to about 2 or 3 cigs a day at that point. She said she didn't ever want me to be as sick as she was. I promised. So, I guess she's my higher power?

I stopped cold turkey that day. The hardest point was when I broke up with my wife I was living a few blocks from a store that would sell loose cigarettes. I had some kind of fight with my stepdad, learned my ex-wife had been cheating on my a little while before we broke up, I'd never see my step-daughter again who I love so much and I just stormed out of my house and was marching to that store and I stopped halfway down my block and clenched my fists and turned back home. That was when I knew I had really quit.

It's been 5 years, I hate the smell of cigarettes now and inhaling even a little bit of second hand smoke could until a year ago give me a withdrawal headache. AMA if you want, if not, just know you CAN do it. It's hard and that's one of the reasons it's worth it.",260,0

Tried so many times but I feel like this is the one. 💕 TY all for being so inspirational!!","**\[EDIT - My apologies to anyone who was bothered by the original post.

I'm so sorry. >\_< Thank you so much for your comments. I will just paste it all below what I'd originally said.\]**

I once quit for 4 years. So on the one hand, I know I can do this. But the fact that I gave up for so long after having stopped for what I thought was forever makes me feel skeptical of my ability to stay quit.

As my fellow alcoholics say, just for today. I need to remember to not think about whether I can stop forever.. but the reality is, I truly do want to! I'm so over this shit. My throat hurts. My head hurts. My breath is horrible. My clothes, my hair, my car. I've let this monster invade me and permeate my life for far too long.

Oh, and of course, the whole health thing. My food issues and sedentary way of existence have kept me from even worrying about cancer very much. But I know it's a serious threat, along with lung disease, heart disease, etc... It's always there, lurking in the back of my mind. Sometimes I look at it as an excruciatingly long suicide. But thankfully, I'm not feeling nearly as hopeless lately.

And the money?! Bloody hell!!

I read most of Alan Carr's Easy Way to Quit Smoking a while back and it really helped shatter some of the programming that we've been exposed to. I'm not sure what initially made me give up, but I'm going to give it an honest try this time. There have been so many times over the past couple of years when I've ""quit."" For like, a weekend? A couple weeks at best. I wasn't truly trying though, I fooled myself into thinking I could do it from sheer will power. This time I'm going to have a go at it with a little help.

Thank you all for being here and for creating such a supportive community!! You guys are amazing and I'm so proud of each and every one of you. Even if you haven't quit yet, the fact that you're considering it is freaking awesome. We got this!!! 🚭💪

>u/Prize_Flight_6795 Big changes primarily come from disgust. I feel your emotions 

Too true. In my experience, though, negative motivation only lasts for so long. After a while, I start to ""forget"" all the awful things about my old habits, whilst longing for the perceived positive things about what I seem to miss.

Of course, the only seemingly positive thing cigarettes can provide is a fleeting relief from the craving caused by the last one I smoked. I've got to remember that they won't actually help anxiety, boredom, etc.. it's all in my head!

>u/Celedte Congrats to you for quitting.Umm I don't know if the subreddit rules were updated but at least I would prefer not to see cigs or packages here (and a lot of people agreed when there was a post about this).

>u/One_shot91 Good job but how did u manage to quit for the 4 years ? Why did u go back after a few years of being smoke free ? Was it the stress 

I have asked myself the same question countless times. Honestly I wasn't even *that* stressed. Just depression and anxiety, mostly. I go through these phases where I just sort of give up on things. I had lost almost 100 lbs., but I've gained almost all of it back. I've tried to get better mentally and physically many times, only to say fuck it. I'm not sure why, but it definitely starts a downward spiral of self-loathing. Ugh, wallowing in self-pity and despair. I feel like I'm coming out of that again in multiple ways, but there's always that little monster on my shoulder full of doubt, almost knowing that it's only a matter of time before I give up on myself again.

I don't know if that has anything to do with it but god damn the lack of stimulation is frustrating and my body just works against me.

I do meditate and exercise and eat healthily but I can't stop fucking smoking. It just feels like there's a part of me that just avoids reasons and caves into bodily desires. Getting my conscious mind to overpower it is a task that is monumentally difficult. The hardest part about quitting is staying consistent and short term victories just burn out really fast.

There is a part of my mind that knows what it wants to substitute stimulation. I've gotten a colouring book and some weights to try hopefully be artistic and fit. I'm very distracted and absent-minded and I'm hoping if I at least *try* then I can overcome these problems.

The cycle is too hard to break. I'm going to try again and really try. I just can't be a slave to my addictions and bodily desires anymore.",3,0

- I went through 216 nicotine lozenges in my first week and a half.

- I now use Zyn nicotine replacement pouches (salts) about 4-5 times a day.

- I eat as many M&Ms, chocolate covered caramels, and as much trail mix as I want. No limits. 

- I try to drink at least 2 liters of water a day.

- As many diet cokes as I want.

- Strong coffee

- Zip Code Walking Challenge: I started a fitness challenge on July 27th that involves walking every paved surface of my zip code. My zip code is 8 square miles and so far I have walked over 900,000 steps! I have been averaging about 11,000 steps a day and I think it’s helping to ward off the weight gain. 

- Initial Goal: 21 days - I told myself that when I quit, I had to go 3 weeks. No excuses. No cigarettes for 21 days, period. I had to give it an honest effort. I said, “If you can make it 21 days straight, you can smoke all the cigarettes that you want to after that. You are free to make stupid adult choices all you want, but you HAVE to quit for 3 weeks first, just to prove it’s possible.” 

Well, 3 weeks came and went and it’s now been 38 days and I haven’t given in yet.

If you think that you will feel better, and I have all those symptoms because I haven’t smoked for a long time, you’re wrong. I haven’t smoked for 5 days only, and it was enough for all these symptoms to appear after a pack and a half (that’s how much I’ve smoked during these two days).
My point is: if you relapse, you won’t get what you are missing right now. You will feel intoxication, your head will become dizzy and you will feel nausea. Maybe the first one will seem nice, but not for a long time. If you haven’t smoked for at least a couple of days, you are already free. You have no way back, because the only chance for you to return to smoking is to continue smoking for several days, so that all those symptoms can become normal to you and you’d stop noticing them.

i guess i was a casual smoker but i don't think that lasts very long before you just become a smoker again.  i never stopped thinking of myself as a smoker.  i can and have bought a pack or two over the course of an entire year and not gone back to my old habits.  i never really thought i'd ever stop entirely.

this past thanksgiving (canada) i was alone for a few days and that's usually the perfect scenario for one of these yearly packs of cigarettes.  but then i started thinking of how crappy it actually feels to start up again and how i'd constantly be thinking about planning my next cigarette and wouldn't be able to fully enjoy the free time uninterrupted.  

the fact that i had every opportunity to smoke and just plain didn't want to is a new and very welcome feeling.  i finally feel like i'm done with cigarettes and identify as an actual non-smoker.",22,0

It was so woven into my life. Every aspect of my life. Every routine. Every plan. Every hour of the day. Or to be precise, every 43 minutes. That’s how long it would take for the little nicotine demons in my head to get loud enough that I’d stumble outside yet again to light up.

And then one day, 68 days ago to be precise, I woke up and I didn’t smoke. And I never have since, not even a puff.

I have lost things in my life: I’ve had close family and dear friends die suddenly. I had a long term marriage that I thought would last forever fall apart in the most painful way. I had possessions of immeasurable sentimental value left to me by my grandfather stolen in a burglary. And so on. I’m sure many of you have experienced these things too.

All these things I think about a lot. They left wounds that may not hurt as bad as they once did, but they still hurt. I still feel their absence badly, and I know I always will. 

But smoking...my constant companion for so many years. A thousand times a thousand little moments of pleasure, right? My little chance for some quiet reflection - hey, it’s almost meditating, right? What a great way to meet people, right? Every part of the act rehearsed over and over to infinity - the physicality of it. The exact spot the butt would rest on the left side of my mouth. The sharp inhale - greedy, almost desperate in its intensity - the way the smoke would expand in my mouth, where I’d hold it for a moment, then another sharp inhale and I’d suck it down into my lungs. 

But now? There’s no sadness. There’s no missing you. I think about you sometimes, it’s true. Quite a lot some days I guess. But not wistfully. It’s more a slightly jarring ‘oh, this moment is an example of when I would’ve smoked’, an odd reminder of something I once did that holds no interest or appeal for me anymore.

It’s like the song goes...now you’re just somebody that I used to know.",244,0

I'm new to Reddit. So sorry if this is too long. Been lurking for a few weeks but no posts. I am a 27M who's been smoking 1-2 packs a day for 10 years. I started in the Army. Got out of the Army in 2017 and I'm still a DoD contractor.

The first time I ever quit was summer of 2017 while I was living in North Carolina. In May 2017 I got sober from alcohol after my wife's suicide. I wanted to clean up everything before I died too. I read Stop Smoking Now by Allen Carr and it really worked for me. I got about 5 weeks then started again at a friend's ash spreading. OCT 2017, another month, a wedding, another relapse. I got out of the Army and got heavily involved with my local AA Community. They're heavy smokers. Tough to quit in that crowd. 

But then I thought I found my breakthrough. I deployed to Afghanistan as a contractor. I was excited to quit because the outside influences would be gone. People think it's hard to quit on deployment I think the opposite. I'm not a stress smoker, I'm a boredom/relaxation smoker. I ordered a vape and started vaping for the first time in MAR 2018. I made it 4 months and then one day for no reason at all, I started again. I quit 2 or 3 more times for weeks to a month until my return to America where I quit quitting haha.

The day after the Super Bowl In 2019 (Patriots Rams), i quit again using the vape. I am an avid daily recreational basketball player and in my younger days it wouldn't affect me at all. I was starting to really feel the exhaustion on the court coupled with the Albuquerque elevation. I made it 4 months again for the second time, then started again at a Jelly Roll concert in Lubbock TX that allowed indoor smoking. Then, on July 6th 2019, my father died. He was only 58 years old. He died of liver and kidney failure, but the 16 years on oxygen with emphysema didn't help. Back home to Maine for the funeral. I quit immediately using the vape. Made it like 8 weeks, started dating a smoker. She didn't last long as I'm not the least bit ready for serious relationships again. I took another deployment gig and left just before COVID in FEB 2020.

This was the most recent time I quit. Another 4 months on the money (with vape), a third relapse right at 4 months. I don't get it. I started to feel like shit every cigarette I smoked. I just start to miss it. It's not physical cravings. Here I am 3.5 years sober but I can't quit smoking. 

I find it easy to actually quit. I have no problem just deciding I'm quitting and stringing together weeks and months. It's staying quit. Some triggers I have identified:

Reading. I read during pretty much all of my down time. But reading is a smoking trigger for me as I used to sit outside and smoke. I chew gum or spit seeds as a remedy. 

Smoking Coworkers. They always ask me if I want to go smoke and usually I avoid them but on two of my relapses this is how it happened. Standing outside with a smoking coworker. 

Going Home. I hate Maine and I can't physically be there without smoking. Just not possible in that cesspool. 

NOT Playing Basketball. COVID has really put a damper on my ability to find an open gym with a crowd. So my biggest reminder to quit is gone. 

I am huge into nutrition and working out already smoking or not smoking. I'm always eating right and lifting. I'm 6'3 230lbs with the body type of a physical NFL Receiver. When I'm not smoking, I progress greatly. When I'm smoking I feel I can only maintain and not progress. 

Any suggestions for how I can improve? I have given up the vape entirely. I haven't had a cigarette since October 5th. But I am already fighting the battle. If no one replies I feel like typing all of this out helped me. So already feeling better. Thank you!",2,2
347,2020-10-16 20:29:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/jcljyx/back_pain_after_quitting/,Back pain after quitting,"First time here, found this sub while looking for advice. This might be a bit long...  
I started smoking about 7 years ago as a social thing, my partners smoke and because we've always lived in places that don't allow indoor smoking, they'd spend a lot of time outside and I'd get lonely, so I picked up smoking as an excuse to hang out with them more, and it eventually developed into a habit.    
A while back I started having what I think were panic attacks, stress related I assume (raising 3 kids as a SAHM will do that) but my chest and heart felt ... strange in an unusual way that really scared me and almost a month ago I ended up in the ER with what I was convinced were heart palpitations.  I don't have insurance or a primary care provider or anything, so if I want to see a doctor I basically wait until it feels like an emergency - I know that's bad but there aren't many other options available to me.  Anyhow, the ER docs of course told me that my lab tests and xray were all basically normal / good, and that smoking was probably causing my awful feelings in my chest area, and that the energy drinks, coffee and sugar that were a large part of my diet also probably contributed.  


I used to sort of took that kind of advice with a grain of salt, but I'm really taking it seriously this time.  That chest strangeness scared me a LOT. When I went into the ER I had most of a pack left... I ended up finishing that pack but it took me two weeks to do instead of the usual two days, and since then I haven't bought any more, and haven't bummed any either (I really hate the taste of the brands my partners smoke so that part seems easy - for now).  I don't remember exactly what day it was that I ran out of cigarettes but I think it's been a week and a half, and I've not only not smoked, but I've also cut my caffeine and sugar down to one coffee or energy drink a week, and no candy at all except for a stress binge a few days ago.    


Everything I read about the effects of quitting tells me that my withdrawal symptoms are normal (except that I don't have cravings - either that or I just don't recognize them as such) but one thing I can't find any good information about is back pain. It all says that back pain is supposed to get BETTER after you quit smoking, but mine seems to be getting worse, and more localized (left side, towards the middle of my ribcage). I also feel increased pressure like something heavy is in my chest, and all the symptoms are worse at night.  I've also been coughing up stuff that looks like someone dumped pepper in egg whites, but not very often - I don't cough much and when I do, it's rare something comes out, but when something does it's really gross and black.  


I've always had anxiety and these symptoms are ramping it up, hard.  I try to calm myself by telling myself it's normal, that it will go away, but the fear doesn't go away - mostly because I can't really go into a doctor to get checked out for something potentially serious.  Help me, friends.... have any of you experienced worsening back pain after quitting? Is this something that will go away after a while or am I going to have to learn to live with this?",1,0

I’m new here and to reddit. I’ve joined this group because I really want to quit smoking. I’m sorry if this turns out to be a novel, just bear with me. 

I know a lot of people can quit cold turkey and that’s amazing. I have never been one of those people. I quit for a few months a few years ago and did it with a vape. I had to throw down a couple hundred to get started, but it worked like a charm. I know the verdict is still out on vapes and no one knows exactly what the effects will be long term. But what I can say for myself is this: after not smoking cigarettes and just using the vape for a couple weeks, my lungs felt clearer. The smokers cough went away. And I didn’t feel so out of breath. So, I still believe that vaping has to be the lesser of two evils here. The only problem is back then, I wasn’t committed. I didn’t really want to quit, I just wanted everyone off my back about it, so I didn’t stick with it. 

Now I definitely WANT to quit. Just to give a tiny bit of background, my daughter and I escaped a very dangerous environment a couple months ago and are in a DV hotel preparing to transition to our own apartment so we can start over. I wanted to put that out there so that maybe one can understand why I’m having reservations about doing this again right now. Since we’ve been here, things are better, but I’ve noticed I’m smoking more than usual, whether it be from nerves or anxiety about what the future holds for us or whatever. I want to buy a vape mod again, but I can’t really justify spending that kind of money on something like that right now. Last night I did break down and buy a much cheaper alternative from a convenience store- something like a juul, but I haven’t been able to use it. Every time I take a puff, it makes me cough like crazy and I don’t think I can stick with that. The mod I had before never did that to me. But it’s so much more expensive. 

So I guess I’m just wondering, does anyone know- if I keep trying with the juul thing, will I eventually be able to smoke it without hacking up a lung every time? Or should I go with what I know worked last time but with a price tag that I feel guilty paying right now? Just looking for some kind of alternative. I don’t want to smoke cigarettes anymore. But I can’t just put them down right now.

Thank you for reading, and sorry it was so long!",8,0

I'm so sick of this, and myself.","I'm sorry, but this is part rant, part looking for tips. I apologize in advance for the length of this post. I'm just at my absolute wits end with nicotine, and myself. I'm actually legit over vaping, I just can't seem to stop myself from continuing. If you want to skip the ranty parts you can scroll down to the 4th paragraph, for some helpful tips I can take on, and practice.

So I posted on here for about a week with my progress just before the pandemic hit, and it all ended and I fell of the wagon, started to vape again. I'm beyond ashamed of myself, and I'm sick of lying to not only myself, but the one person that is supposed to have my back. My wife. I've lied right to her face ***again*** saying I haven't vaped in 6 months. I am a terrible person for doing this, but I for whatever reason still do it. (I have some thoughts on why I actually do it, but For right now it's not relevant to this post). At this point, I can't even go to her for support. She can't handle this kind of thing, especially right now. I'm trying to quietly handle things, and just keep my bearings when I attempt this time. 

So I decided that After I finish this pod I have, I'm gonna jump back on the wagon, and hopefully make this my final run, and make it all for good. I'll provide a little backstory so help you all understand where I'm coming from and why I think I need help getting past the first 2 weeks. I started smoking at the age 14, I was a wild child and I don't know how my mom ever dealt with me. I was doing drugs (I'm not counting weed btw, but I was smoking that too.) smoking cigs, drinking stupid amounts for that age, and just general mayhem. By 16 for whatever reason I had apparently decided that I wasn't gonna live past 30, so fuck it I'm gonna go as wild as possible. Well, by 18 I was basically forced into getting my GED, directly after that I got my parents house robbed after throwing a stupid party for Halloween. I was smoking a pack a day at this point. I made the best decision I have ever made. Joined the Army reserve. After the initial training I was smoking two packs a day, and it was so commonplace that I stopped noticing how much I was smoking at all. I met my now wife and she was awesome, I decided to switch over to vaping, just for her since she has mild asthma. From that point on that's all I did, and still do now. Nicotine has now been associated with every part of my life. I feel like EVERYTHING is a fucking trigger for me. Like I feel like I can't enjoy things the second I stop because it's literally the only thing I can think about. plus, withdrawals physically cause my pain. I grind/clench my teeth causing super bad jaw pains, the headaches are borderline migraine pain levels. I have some other much more minor symptoms, like stomach aches, but their mild enough to almost not notice.

If you've made it this far I really appreciate it, now I can get into the tips, and anything helpful. I'm gonna list a few options I know will help me succeed since I didn't stick to any of these any other time I failed successfully on quitting lol. 

1. No Alcohol. for a period of time until I personally show zero cravings of any kind, or I can look past them without thinking about it. For right now, I'm gonna just not drink until I feel I'm ready, and the least amount of time I'm gonna say is 6 months. This is the easy one lol.
2. A mouth guard. for after work and sleeping. I'm not sure how that will help me during the day, since I'm in a ""customer service"" kind of job (it is but isn't, I'm not gonna get into that though). So **I'll take tips on this!**
3. A fidget spinner it's something to keep my hands busy. I'm also gonna look into some other basic replacement hobbies as to keep my mind and hands busy, but I can't think of anything I can take to work for my breaks and lunches yet. **I'LL TAKE SUGGESTIONS ON THIS ONE!** 
4. Some kind of oral replacement. I used to use mints, but it's too close to menthol which is my preferred  flavor to vape on, I refuse to use any gum because ironically it hurts my gums lol, I'm thinking something like ticktaks. **I'll take any suggestions on this!** 
5. Deep Breathing exercises. I have No idea about this kind of thing, If you have links to anything on the topic I'll take them. I will google some later tonight, but I'm not as studied as some of you might be on this topic. I don't know if there is correct posture, or simple ones I can use while I'm at work, I'd love to hear some of your tips and things that helped you as well! 
6. Financial freedom! So I figured that I would reward myself with my own money lol, I've figured out how long I takes me to go through a standard 2 pod pack and I figured that each day I would take the 20 bucks out of my checking and put it into my savings account. Watch all that money I saved. This is also good since my wife and I are starting to get to the point where we're looking to start saving extra to put down for a house! 

If you have any general advice, or words of encouragement I would greatly appreciate them! I really need some support and I'll make sure I'm checking in with you all at least daily, because This kind of thing just isn't easy for me. My addictive personality is the bane of my existence, and if can get past this part of my life, then I can do anything! Again I apologize how long this whole thing was, but I really needed to get it out, and I don't have anyone else to talk to about this kind of thing. I know you can all relate in some way shape or form, so I appreciate this sub existing and TIA to all that help a brother when he's down! Have a great day/night where ever you might be when you read this!",1,1

And I LOVE TO SMOKE.
Or so I think. I used to despise of cigarettes. My mom smoked, my uncle smoked, my Aunt Margaret smoked. I hated it. Looking back at it, with a name like Margar-ette no wonder cigarettes we’re everywhere. So no smoking for me. Yet it was expressed how normal it was. Smoke, smoke, smoke.
   Then I smoked weed with a friend at 17. The older conservatives always say that weed is a gateway drug. Well for cigarettes it was. Weed was intense. Made my mind radical. And one day my foster sister said, “you know.. if you just take a puff of this cigarette it will mellow you out”
I caved. 
Been smoking ever since. That was seventeen.
I’m 30 now. In the beginning I didn’t care. It was cool. Necessary.  But then I was like ok.. 25 and I’m done.. nope. 
I LOVE TO SMOKE. 
I’ve thought a lot about that. 
“ I Love To Smoke “

Sometimes I wonder if it’s not so much that I love to smoke and don’t want to because I know the effects it’s causes. But that I don’t actually like to smoke, and the addiction is chemically making believe that I like smoking. After all how many times does someone fall in love with someone under the influence of alcohol, ecstasy, and molly. Only to disregard them in the morning. 
I don’t know what I’m doing 
But what I do know is what’s going on now. 
I can kiss my girlfriend whenever I want. My car doesn’t smell. My lungs feel better. My brain has gone from thinking about cigarettes every ten minutes to every hour or so. I have more money in my pocket. I don’t need a “break” every ten minutes from whatever I’m currently doing.

This writing technique will help you overcome cravings. Do it when you have a strong urge.

👉Step 1: Try to get the strongest desire for a cigarette, that you possibly can.

👉Step 2: Rate your desire for a cigarette, on a scale of 1 to 10.
1 for ""I don't want to smoke"" and 10 for “I must smoke now.” Use this technique only
if your desire for a cigarette is 6 and above.

👉Step 3: Grab a pen and a piece of paper. With your right hand, start describing your craving and everything related to it.
• What is your mind telling you about smoking? 
• What do you think will happen if you don't smoke? 
• How do you know that's accurate? What could you do to cope without a cigarette?

👉Step 4: Time to give voice to your cigarettes.
Let your habit use your left hand, and answer these questions:
• Why is it still with you? What does smoking want from you? 
• How will your life improve if you don't smoke? 
• What would that mean to you? 
Keep writing until you have at least 10 lines.

👉Step 5: Stop and check.

On a scale of 1 to 10, how intense is your desire for a cigarette now? If it hasn’t gone completely, keep writing until it’s gone.

Note: If you are left handed, use your left hand for step 3 and right hand for step 4.

Try it and send me your thoughts and experiences!! 
Peace!",7,0

My girlfriend said she would quit with me, which turned into she would quit before baby is born. I am so frustrated, her smoking smells so nasty right now. 

She says quiting smoking is harder for her cause she has been smoking since she was 12. Im like addiction is addiction once youre past the chemical cravings its behavioral which you can get over by having a having a strong motivation. Like our baby or even me.

I came up with a pretty strict budget so we can afford to buy all our baby stuff comfortably. I assigned her tobacco money which she agreed to. It was a reasonable amount, cause when I smoked I woulda been ok with it. The budget has been implace for 2 pay cycles now. She asked how much money she had for gas yesterday, I told her $30. She comes home she spent the gas money on smokes. 

Im like how selfish you gotta be, I have 0 fun money in our budget, Im the main bread winner and all my money goes towards household expenses. She is out here spending our gas money on smokes. In a week when she runs out she gonna be mad and Im gonna be the bad guy.

I created a intervention tool for smoking secession which motivates you and helps you to create a concrete action plan to change your smoking habits.

It consists of three parts:

1. Consequences of changing your smoking habits. 
2. Writing a smoke free future to strive towards and a future where you are still smoking to avoid.
3. Writing goals to achieve the smoke free future.

The parts are Google Forms docs where you get asked questions and have to answer in an autobiographic fashion. 

There is also a survey about your current smoking habit and E-mail/Reddit collection so I can E-mail/RedditDM you a the smoking habit survey a second time in 4 days to check if your habits changed.

To proof the tools efficacy I need participants who want to stop smoking and are willing to spend the 30 minutes to do the intervention. The intervention is anonymous. 

If you have questions you can contact me on Reddit.

This is not my first quit attempt but I’m absolutely determined to make it my last. Thank you everyone for all the inspiration and motivation I get from reading posts here. I know that no one is particularly interested in my life story, but I need somewhere to share it. I know that 1 week is nothing in the grand scheme of things, and I still have many years ahead of me, but to me it’s a huge achievement, I hope people here can relate. 

I’ve been a 20 a day smoker for 10 or so years. I have had several attempts at quitting, using a vape. The first time started successfully but ultimately resulted in a relapse. I have tried a few times since, using a vape, each time without great success. I know that vaping has worked for some, but for me it’s just too similar to smoking. 

This time I’m using NRT and it’s working well so far. I’m using a combo of a patch and gum, and I have used an inhaler a couple of times when I get bad cravings. Today I seem to be craving less, and today has been the first time in years that I’ve eaten a big meal and the thought of smoking immediately after hasn’t even crossed my mind. 

I started smoking in school, not because I thought it made me cool but because smoking was so normal to me. My parents smoke, my grandparents smoked, and their friends smoked too. I saw smoking as normal from a young age, I don’t blame anyone for my own shitty decisions in life, but the people I looked up to were all smokers so smoking to me was completely normal. My grandmother is dying of cancer. I’ve already lost my other grandmother and one grandfather to cancer as well. My parents are both heavy smokers and I fear that I will lose them in the same way. I know that I cannot change them, but I am determined to do everything in my power to ensure that my children and one day, my grandchildren, do not have to see me in the way that I have seen so many of those dear to me. I am determined to ensure that they don’t see smoking as normal, in the same way that I once saw it as normal. 

The last few times I’ve tried quitting I’ve done it for reasons like saving money, but this is the first time that I’m doing it for me, my health and my family.

Sorry for the long post, but I needed to share this. If I have a bad day in the future where I’m close to breaking, I can come back and read this post, I hope at least a few people here can relate to my past too. I get so envious when I see people who have been smoke free for one year, two years, three years etc. I’m only on day seven after all! But that envy gives me motivation! Thank you all so much!",57,0

I’ve been under stress and hard times, and it hasn’t triggered me. 

But yesterday I got home from work and sat down to relax. I’d had a great day. I wasn’t feeling sad or stressed. My roommate had left his tobacco on the table and gone out. This isn’t unusual - his tobacco has been around for months and never bothered me. 

Suddenly, I felt a strong urge and before I’d really thought about it, I was rolling a cig. I went out and smoked it. It tasted bad, but felt kind of familiar and comforting. 

This morning I don’t have the urge to smoke. I feel guilty and really confused. Why now? I don’t understand why I did that? Am I still an addict? Has this happened to any of you before?

[Impossible? I think not. ](https://preview.redd.it/dnk227q2mjs51.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=3313ec866104df8907bb5f24d7433c73ebb26e50)

&#x200B;

TLDR – This is the story of how nicotine controlled my life, and how I’m fighting back. The impossible is possible. I hope there are a few nuggets of information in here that may help anyone who needs it.

&#x200B;

EDIT (for proper context) - To clarify, 2 packs every 3 days was what I was smoked **as a freshman in high school, NOT when I quit smoking a few weeks ago.** At the time of my quitting, I was smoking 3 vape pods every 2 days, in addition to 1 weed pod every 2-3 days. This is not safe and I would strongly advise against mixing nicotine & THC on a daily basis. It's just not good for you.

&#x200B;

\----

&#x200B;

I smoked for 15 years – since I was a freshman in high school. I hung out with bad people, did drugs, then received cigarettes from my mom because it was the “significantly lesser of the evils”. I thought it was cool to be a “gangsta”. I thought it was cool to do hardcore drugs, as well as softer ones. I thought it was cool to throw away all that my parents did for me. Damn, how wrong I was.

2 packs every 3 days. Marlboro lights and reds. I smoked a lot, because nobody could stop me.

I’ve had asthma since I was young. During high school, I got good grades - 4.0 nearly every quarter. I played sports as well (wrestling, volleyball). But I kept smoking, kept hanging out with bad people, and kept making bad decisions. It continued through to college.

In college, I partied even harder. I went the social fraternity route, where they ONLY party. I got kicked out of college for bad grades, then went to a community college – where I smoked even more! Those were a good 3+ years of not doing shit – except for partying, smoking, and destroying my life.

Eventually, I made my way back to university - electrical engineering at a California State College. I still smoked a ton, and still partied. But upon getting back to university, I had to take a placement exam for math as an engineer, and I bombed that test so hard that they kicked my math down to remedial levels. To top that off, I failed my first engineering class back, and had severe math course requirements to make up in order to proceed even further. Long story short – if I thought I’d be done in 2 more years, I was wrong. I had a LONG and STRESSFUL way to go.

**That simply means that it was a tough road - with lots of smoking. LOTS. And LOTS. Damn, it was a lot. I’d smoke between classes. I’d go for smoke breaks in classes. I reeked of smoke, and it wasn’t only nicotine that was being smoked. I was poisoning my lungs all day long.**

When vapes came out, it got even worse. Now, I’d smoke anywhere and everywhere. Whether I’d be at home, at a friend’s house, or at school – I always had to get my fix. I was THAT GUY who smoked the most out of my friend group and everyone I knew. Vape just made this problem worse. In terms of nicotine though, first it was cigarettes, then both cigarettes and vape, then vape only.

**Yup - I went through ALL the vape phases. You know, you start off with them eGos. Then you move up to something else, like a provari. Then you start becoming an expert at modding and “building wicks”. Oh, how they get you. As I kept going and going, vaping evolved to cannabis also, so you bet I was on that train. I’d use my inhaler sometimes between weed hits. I could feel myself getting anxiety from weed and nicotine and all this smoking. I went down a freaking spiral, and didn’t stop.**

Heck, even if I was in a car with my FAMILY, going to a FAMILY dinner, I’d still vape in front of them. I was that messed up. ***I was that addicted. I was that guy.***

&#x200B;

……………………………………………………

&#x200B;

Fast forward to 2015-2016, I decided engineering school was not for me. I decided that business was my passion. However, my mom begged me not to drop out of engineering school. And for business, the best time to start is always yesterday. So I started my business halfway through engineering school, and did these both at the same time. Do you know how stressful that was? **Take whatever I was smoking before, and multiply it by 2.** I could cry and feel tears in my eyes, when I think back to how much pain I was in during this period and how difficult this was.

If it was a non-school day, or if I was going HAM on my business, I’d be smoking all day. My room would literally, be a hotbox of just vape. The air in my home was became bad – because of me. At this point, I also withdrew a lot socially, in order to focus on these priorities of business and school. **That led to even more stress, as I watched my friends slowly graduate one by one, party and have fun, and start really living life.** Guess what more stress means. I don't even have to say it. Downward spiral much?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Not me, but my room was similarly smoked, lol. I wish I had pictures, sorry. Source: filomedia @ pond5](https://preview.redd.it/x351nwvdnjs51.jpg?width=3840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bac4e26e53abfcc0d7c137c13c3512c9e85858ad)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

…………….…. but never mind that, I got priorities, right? ……………………………

&#x200B;

My first business was a modification I made on an existing invention. It sold out 5 manufacturing runs and I still lost money. *Oh wells, I’ll just smoke the pain away.*

I started 2 other e-commerce stores after that, both of which failed due to issues where we could not get to making sales. *More smoking.*

Then the next store I built, somewhere around 2017 or so, we hit it off. I did 7 figures in sales within a year (sales, not profit – but still damn good though). Then, due to some bad business decisions and some suppliers bait/switching me, I lost it all. I watched my bank account, go from nothing… all the way to 6 figures… then back down to NEGATIVE 5 figures. And, it was a slow burn down also. Not a fast one. Believe me, I tried EVERYTHING I could to fix the business, but nothing was working at that time. *Guess what –* *even MORE smoking. Now it was getting bad.*

Mind you, I’m still in school also. And electrical engineering school is math heavy, which made things even more difficult because I hated math. But I persevered, whilst using nicotine to fuel myself. A poor decision that led me to smoke even more than I could imagine – now it was becoming a burden to smoke. However, at this point, my life was ecommerce, smoking, and school. ONLY. I literally became a “grandpa” and “turtle” and withdrew from a majority of social things. *That means puff, puff, and puff.*

I ended up building 2 other stores that failed after that. They were good stores, but they never took off. More smoking. *I learned a LOT, but I smoked a lot as well.*

Then I had a breakthrough. I partnered up with a friend who built a store but was not profitable on most days, and barely profitable on some days. We went 50/50 – and in 3 days of work I cut his advertising in half. I was ecstatic, and *I was still smoking a lot.* After a few more days, he decided to “ghost me” because we didn’t sign paperwork, as I trusted him. He basically said “I think this is something I have to do alone”, then went MIA (after I made his story very profitable). *I lost it, and smoked even more from that stress.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

………………………… what a sucky story …………………….

&#x200B;

# Except I fought back.

&#x200B;

I worked every hour I could (smoked every hour I could also, haha). He scammed me, but I learned a ton and started making breakthroughs. **I kept grinding, kept smoking, kept grinding, kept smoking.**

That experience gave me the insights and strength I needed to rebuild the right way. It was very stressful, very smokey, yes – but at the same time – it was what was needed to take me to the next level.

My health is important, and how can I possibly make an impact on the world if I’m smoking every minute I’m on this planet? Stuff just started clicking, not only in terms of business, but also in terms of beginning to think about the long term implications of smoking. Yeah, I was even that guy at the gym who would vape immediately as soon as I got out of the gym, on the way home, and after the post workout shower. I hated nicotine, but at the same time I couldn’t stop nicotine.

&#x200B;

I’ll spare you guys the details, but fast forward a ton of work later, I’ve finally clawed my way out of rock bottom in business. My business has huge plans for 2021, and we’ve already done pretty good in 2020 and have made excellent progress. I am a learner, and every struggle makes me stronger. I’ve crawled out of my rock bottom hole, have rebuilt my business, and have really started focusing more on innovation and being the best option in the market for anything we sell. In a nutshell \~ doing business the right way, by way of innovation & domination.

**I’d like to think that I am an inventor who had to learn how to market and sell. BUT, NO MATTER WHAT I THOUGHT, I KNEW FOR A FACT that I was also a smoker who had lost control of his life to nicotine. In order to succeed you must pay a “price” – but my health was the wrong “price” to pay. This was a skeleton in my closet that I had to conquer.**

&#x200B;

In the midst of this, I managed to barely scrape by and graduate with my electrical engineering degree, which I’ve just received this past summer. I hated every second of it. **I smoked myself through everything I learned.** But at least I finished it. Momma got what she wanted, even though I have no use for this degree.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Sorry, I haven't taken any graduation pictures yet. ](https://preview.redd.it/ptvgek9oqjs51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10486cb0a61657ba1c0cdacdf31b4a3566cdd479)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

… Sweet. Now life is finally starting to rebuild. But I’ve still got to conquer my biggest demon …

&#x200B;

***You do that dance. You know, that old dance*** – I’ll put my vape down, tell myself NO MORE, then find myself picking that crap up a few minutes later. Sometimes unconsciously, without even noticing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

… I don’t know what happened, but a few weeks ago, I just went down this rabbit hole of redditing and googling and watching content about smoking and quitting. Seed was planted, or rather – the seed is being watered as I’ve wanted to quit for a while now. But I wasn’t strong enough. No trigger. No catalyst yet. Mind you, when I smoked, there were times when I had chest pains and kept smoking. This started happening a few years ago. Something to do with asthma? Blood pressure? Etc etc…? Not sure.

… Then a little over 2 weeks ago, I smoked a lot of nicotine, a bit too much. I topped it off with a few ganja hits ….

&#x200B;

But something felt off. I started having a full blown panic/anxiety attack, and just felt immense pain everywhere. It was in my chest, yes… but for some odd reason my back started feeling uncomfortable, laying down felt uncomfortable, and I just felt like crap. Not sure why this happened – maybe it was a stroke of luck from God, but it happened.

&#x200B;

# I decided I had enough. I decided that I was no longer going to let nicotine control me.

&#x200B;

In tears, I went to talk to my mom. I just told her I needed to talk to her, and I’m fortunate that she worked as a social worker for the county (people go to her for food stamps basically). **Because the first thing I said when I opened my mouth was – “I need help.”**

I don’t know why I said that. I’m never that “weak” – but this time, I just gave myself up. I finally admitted, that I had a fucking problem.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I’ve kicked weed a few times in the past and have smoked on/off for years at a time… but nicotine was always the constant. I NEVER missed a day of smoking for 15 years. One day I almost came close – when I got my wisdom teeth pulled out. The doctor told me NO SMOKING. Guess what I did after I went home and rested? Yup – I vaped – against the doctor’s orders. As I said, I was that guy.

&#x200B;

…

…

…

&#x200B;

# And quit I did. I threw it all away. Grabbed all my vape AND weed paraphernalia, and anything even remotely related to it. Fucking crumpled it all up and threw it in a bag, and threw it away.

# This must be done, symbolically. To show your mind – “hey, fuck you nicotine. I’m in charge. You’ve taken away enough from me”

&#x200B;

…

…

…

&#x200B;

**And I haven’t looked back since.**

I must have cried 25+ times throughout the first few days, just by myself. For no damn reason. Just start tearing up. But I knew that this was a demon I had to conquer.

And you know what, it isn’t painful to fight this demon. The pain comes from the EXPECTATION of pain that you’ll feel, when trying to fight nicotine. **But believe me, you can do it.**

&#x200B;

…

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# I am now 15 days clean.

**Me, the guy who all my family, friends, everyone – would NEVER EVEN FATHOM quitting – I’ve fucking quit.**

&#x200B;

*I’ve ALREADY quit for good. I say that, because there are no ands, ifs, or buts. There is absolutely 0 chance of me relapsing. Done is done. I’ve had enough of you, nicotine. 15 years you’ve taken from me. You've given me nothing and have taken so much. But now no more.*

&#x200B;

That’s 15 years of bad health.

15 years of hurting those around me.

15 years of not being fully ‘present’, because I’d always need my nicotine fix.

15 years of thinking that school/business/weed was giving me ANXIETY, but it was actually nicotine that was doing it.

**And most importantly, 15 years of being controlled by this monster they call - nicotine... now - over.**

&#x200B;

# The labor is finished. The task is complete. The next level of life is unlocked. Goodbye nicotine, and thank you for absolutely nothing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Thank you to anyone who read this far. That is my story.

&#x200B;

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Here are the tips and tricks I used to FIGHT BACK against my addiction. I hope this helps someone:

**1.** You must know, that you must FIGHT. I promise you, it’s worth it. You might think nicotine is making you “less stressed” and giving you “more energy” to deal with life – but it’s a false illusion. It’s a temporary fix, for more pain later. And it snowballs.

These past 2 weeks have been the most STRESSFREE I’ve been, actually.

&#x200B;

**2.** The first thing you must do is download an app. Some type of quit smoking app. The one I used charges $7 a month, but gives you access to counselors. Trust me, it’s worth it. Just spend that damn $7, even if you feel like you don’t need it. It will force you to talk to these people.

&#x200B;

**3.** Next, in order to fight the cravings, you must MOVE YOUR BODY. Just force yourself to move it.

Take a walk, do some yoga, do some meditation, go for a run.

I know these 4 things are things you DO NOT WANT TO HEAR, or are LAZY AS FUCK when it comes to it….

But believe me – from smoker to smoker:

When you’re running at full speed, you aren’t going to be thinking about a cigarette or vape. You’re going to be thinking about how badly your lungs hurt.

I ran through that pain. I used this pain to EXORCISE the demon out of me.

If I did have a craving while walking, then I had to punish my body with a small 10 second sprint.

Believe me, it’s fucking worth it. It felt so liberating – as I hated running. But for some reason, running this time, feels great. My lungs stopped hurting as bad. More air was going in them.

&#x200B;

**4.** Throughout your activities, put on some motivational podcasts. These helped me immensely. Just type something like “change your life motivation” into YouTube. Play it in the background, and go for a small jog. I guarantee by the end of your jog, you’ll be a better person than you were before you started that jog.

&#x200B;

**5.** GUM. BUY GUM. XYLITOL is my go to, because it will WHITEN YOUR TEETH. Plus, it will define your jawlines. Remind yourself of this. Remind yourself to take care of yourself. Yup – just by you taking care of yourself, this DOES snowball. So don’t forget.

&#x200B;

**6.** Replace the unhealthy habits with the healthy habits. WAIT – before you skim past this, hear me out.

Think about HOW MUCH TIME YOU WOULD SPEND VAPING/SMOKING. THINK OF HOW MUCH EXTRA TIME IS WASTED, BECAUSE YOUR BRAIN HAS TO KEEP SWITCHING TASKS AS YOU GET CRAVINGS.

Now fill that void, with stuff that makes you a better person. Fill that void with meditation and yoga, because chances are, the nonsmokers in your life don’t do that anyways. So let’s take this opportunity, to ascend in our lives and get to the next level.

I started showering 2-3 times a day, started taking better and better care of my health, grooming, cleaning, sorting out my life, etc…. and you know what – doing this has been immense help.

&#x200B;

**7.** Steps 1 to 6 were very helpful to me as now I rarely get cravings. HOWEVER, when I do, there are a few things I tell myself. Some mantras. Some phrases. Check this out.

\> First, identify if it is a PHYSICAL or MENTAL craving. If it’s physical, that means you need to get your body moving. Do something else. If it’s a mental, gum will do the trick.

\> If it’s a mental and gum isn’t helping, I assure you this trick will help. Instead of trying to resist your craving, instead… just WATCH YOUR CRAVING COME AND GO. Just watch and observe. Don’t fight, don’t react. Just watch it. Just feel it. It’s there, but it isn’t really. So just watch it come and go. Because it will go.

\> You must view the nicotine craving as a demon. The evil nicotine demon. You must realize, that when you feel like shit due to the cravings… that more nicotine isn’t the solution. Do you feel pain that you’re going to explode and die because no nicotine???? My friend, that’s EXACTLY WHAT THE NICOTINE DEMON does to you. It tricks you into thinking that the solution to this pain, is more poison in your body. Think about that for a second. You want to cure pain with poison????!?!? Kidding me.

\> Lastly, you must remember the main benefit of quitting. I thought it was my health, but I was wrong. It isn’t your health. It’s not money. It’s not family. It’s not this, not that. I’ll tell you what it is.

The main benefit is that you’re more present and in the moment. You’re here. You’re normal again. YOU. ARE. BACK. TO. NORMAL. AGAIN. Don’t you ever forget that. This has implications on every aspect of your life. So let’s make these implications GOOD implications. Trust me, you will thank yourself later.

**8.** Allen carr has a great book and there are links somewhere here. But to sum it up in a nutshell, or at least to give you what I GOT out of it – Allen carr smoked 100+ cigs a day, even when he was ALREADY dying. He had constant pain. He was so addicted, he had to smoke in order to turn on a light bulb. Goddam, now that – is addicted. Yet, he was able to quit.

He used a simple shift in mentality, which also helps me. What is it?

QUITTING SMOKING IS NOT YOU TRYING TO CLIMB THIS LARGE UPHILL MOUNTAIN OF PAIN.

EVEN IF YOU’VE ONLY QUIT AND BEEN CLEAN FOR 5 MINUTES… THE POINT IS THAT YOU ARE ALREADY AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN.

You’re already “quit”. Now, you have to make that downhill climb of “maintenance and not relapsing” into smoking.

Well, that’s what I got out of it – but I encourage you to read it.

&#x200B;

**9.** Lastly, if you’re ever in a tough time, please TALK ABOUT IT. You guys here on reddit, are absolutely amazing. Hearing the stories of others, being able to provide insights to others, and helping others through their struggles – is really a medicine and high of its own.

If it wasn’t for all these support networks and amazing subreddits and people in them, I’m not sure if I could have done this. Seriously.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\-----------------

&#x200B;

So please, if you’re in a similar position, and have a craving – before you send more poison into your body, why don’t you send someone here on reddit a message. Even me. Post something. Comment something. **Just reach out and talk to someone! Because you’re not the only one struggling. I thought it was impossible for me to quit, but I did it.** Just trust me, there’s something about talking to someone who has been in a similar situation, which is really reassuring. And at this point, we really have to support each other because smoking technology is only going to get more addictive and accessible as time goes on.

&#x200B;

Thank you guys for reading everything. It is a long story, yes – but I sincerely hope this helps someone. If you need help, just ask and I will do my best to help.

&#x200B;

**15 years I smoked every single fucking day. Now I’m 1 day clean for each year I smoked. Pretty soon, it’ll be 2 days clean for each year. Then 3. Point is – I’m done with nicotine, and there is no looking back. It feels fucking great to be free again. To be myself again. And to have my full potential back again.**

&#x200B;

# And P.S. - Fuck you, nicotine. Seriously. Fuck you.

&#x200B;

Sincerely,

Kenny",275,0

I just wanna do a quick recap of my first 15 days smoke free, quitting from more than 30 cigs a day cold turkey, without any nicotine supplements, because i think it may help someone.

&#x200B;

The first 3 days were hard, but not the hardest. The first day i was thinking about smoking all the time, and interestingly enough, i was not having the worst physical withdrawals at that point.

&#x200B;

The worst days were day 3-6, where i only managed to sleep about 3 hours at night because my body was literally feeling like it was falling apart. Each and every joint hurt like hell.

Here is a study that talks about that: [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2002/02/020222074202.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2002/02/020222074202.htm)

I took some melatonin that really helped me fall a sleep, but i was still waking up after like 3- 5 hours the first week or so, but then, at day 7. It all went away.

It has been easy ever since then.

I have no desire to smoke, and i feel damn great, and i'm making great progress in the gym, i can breathe properly again, and i feel 100 times better when i wake up in the morning.

&#x200B;

I just wanted to share this, because you really only need to last about one week cold turkey, in order to quit this habit for good. You can do it. I'm almost 16 days in now, and i can say with confidence, that my desire to smoke is gone for good. And i loved my cigarettes, trust me, i really did.

Godspeed!",25,0

Last year, I suddenly developed a desire to learn how smoking felt like. Like I had several dreams about it, and would find myself subconsciously mimicking smoking poses. None of my friends nor family smoke so I have no idea where this sudden craving came from. 

A couple of months or so later a friend offered me a cigarette. Obviously, I took it because why not.  I didn’t really like it (the high was mediocre at best and I think I embarrassed myself with all the coughing). This happened around January or February, and since then my desire to smoke has largely decreased. I kind of like the aesthetic of smoking etc but I do *not* like smoking tobacco. I’m 18 so I could go and buy a pack of cigarettes right now if I wanted to, but I have no desire to.

Then I watched some video on how a person tried one cigarette and ended up addicted, and it made me think. Is the whole ‘one cigarette and you’re addicted’ thing over hyped?

I had been wanting to do this for a long time but kept finding excuses not to do it; I’m too weak, I’ll get fatter, I’ll do it tomorrow, next week, next month, next year!! But with the stark figures for smokers & coronavirus staring me in the face, I felt I had nowhere to hide. So I dug deeper than I’ve had to in a long time & started my not smoking journey. And I will not lie, the first 4-6 weeks were HELL; massive cravings, nausea, insomnia, emotions all over the place, anxiety. You name it, I had it! But somehow I kept going. I used nicotine replacement patches. I know they’re not for everyone but they definitely helped me. But I still had to push through every day. I had/have great support from my family & friends but it really is a solitary battle; me & cigarettes. But it has got easier. The cravings are not constant like they were, but can still blindside me. I see someone smoking & I want to grab their cigarette & smoke it (I know, 🤢!!)! But cigarettes do not control me & my life. My clothes & hair don’t stink of smoke. I’m not constantly angry with myself for spending money every day on the damn things. I don’t have to panic cos I don’t have enough cigarettes in the house. I know this will be a lifelong battle. I am an addict so I know for me, without a shadow of a doubt, if I have even 1 cigarette I’ll be back where I started. So my mantra is NOPE= Not One Puff Ever. This is why I don’t say I’ve quit smoking as I can’t predict how things will go. I can only deal with today & the next & the next!! But I am very proud of what I have achieved so far.

He started a new job that requires him to travel and be gone for 3-7 days at a time. Money has been tight and things have been kind of turbulent as we adjust to the new schedule, we ended up running out of juice. 

Hubby brings home the bacon so he got the last of it before he left for work on Sunday. Thankfully one of his coworkers vapes too and he's been very generous - keeping my husband from losing his mind. I officially ran out on Monday and BOY has it been rough.

I'm epileptic and I've had at least 6 auras in the last 3 days from the stress associated with withdrawal and PMDD. Rolling nausea keeping me on the edge; anxious about having another aura and the possibility of it escalating...which makes cravings worse, which stresses me out, which makes me anxious...it's a shitty cycle. 

That should be enough to keep me from using nicotine again but there is a part of me saying that my Neurologist suggested to taper off and mmmaybe I should go back up to 3mg? But the rest of me knows that makes no damn sense. I guess one of the reasons I'm here is for y'all to tell me the same thing.

I'm already getting over the three day hump, might as well just keep rolling with it, right?

What if this happens again? Why am I entertaining the thought of torturing myself again in the future? Future me doesn't deserve that.

My withdrawal has been parallel with my menstrual cycle...I already kind of know how to deal with it and might be able to get through it next month, and the month after that, and the month after that...

I'm not quite ready to quit vaping all together yet so I can still use 0mg juice as some kind of pacifier.

Can anyone else help me find more reasons I may have missed? Anyone else gone through the same thing and can give me some advice? Thank you in advance :)",5,0

I'm only on day 6 of my quit, and I am using patches.

I have smoked heavily for 25 years.

On days 3 and 4 I had very strong withdrawals that I felt I would succumb to. Yesterday, I had absolutely zero craving at all, at any point. I was even around a person who smoked, who ended up smelling repugnant to me.

Today I have also had absolutely no cravings at all. I haven't even been particularly busy or distracted.

Is this just because the nic patches are doing there job?

Do the cravings tend to come in waves?

I am quite concerned that I may just be kicking the can down the road a bit. I am also still burning cannabis (though I intend to address this after the cigs are kicked) without tobacco, and replicating that act of smoking in the evening is probably helping with the habitual side of things a LOT.

Basically i'm just quite worried that I should be having far more difficulty now than I am, and if i'm not is it just because i'm delaying the real struggle?

I am not intending to quit smoking at all for now, but I found a way that helps me avoid the cravings when I put my smoking on pause.
2 year in a row I am doing my own Sober October - no alcohol, no nicotine, no sugar for a month. It’s inspired by Joe Rogan but I made up my own rules. Usually it’s impossible for me to start a day without a cig after the breakfast. So what I did on the October 1st - I skipped the breakfast and lunch. Food is the biggest trigger for cravings in my experience, because I always have a puff after snack. Usually I eat high carb food, and switching my diet to keto is also a life saver for the month. It feels like my body doesn’t treat low carb food as a trigger to smoke.
It’s been almost 8 days since I’ve “paused smoking” this year and I had about 1 strong craving and probably 2-3 mild ones, so I am pretty sure I can make it to the end of the month this year, as I did in 2019.

What works for me might not work for you as every human being is different. But what I would advise you, is to find those triggers that cause your cravings and eliminate them from your life :)

As the title says, I think I've reached a relapse at around 3 months mark.

I bought myself a pack on Sunday, for some reason. It's been a stressful period of my life, so I decided to just have a drag or two, and then throw it out. Well, it turns out I already bought my second pack today. So from Sunday until Thursday, I'm already at my second pack. Before I quit smoking, I used to smoke about 25-30 cigs a day. Now that I started again, I only smoke in the evening before going to sleep, and I usually have a few cigarettes one after another - chain smoking. 

The real red flag occurred today, because I lit a cigarette at around noon already, and that's a major problem because I can already see myself falling back where I was before, and smoking 30 cigs a day ...

For anyone out there that experienced something similar, is it easier or harder to quit again after a relapse ? I'm pretty sure it has not become a ""routine"" for me yet, so by that logic, it should be easier. But then again, I do feel cravings when I don't smoke.

The first time when I quit (about 3 months ago), my reasons and rationale on why to quit were pretty strong. I haven't had a single puff in almost 3 months. But this Sunday, everything sort of just went out of the window, and my reasons are getting weaker and weaker after every cig that I have.

Any tips on how to overcome this ? No way is it going to be as hard as the first time ? The first time quitting, I quit after 8 years of smoking.

Need advice on coping with anxiety from withdrawals.,"Hey y'all. Long story short is I've been smoking on and off for maybe 2 years now.

I have BPD and PTSD, and have used excessive smoking as a coping mechanism whenever I get panic attacks and/or flashbacks.

I'm done with this stuff. I'm tired of all the baggage that comes with smoking, and I'm tired of sacrificing my long term health to deal with short term lapses in mental health.

that being said, whenever I have my mental health episodes, my judgement lapses. They're nothing short of unbearable. I find myself seeking the familiar comforts even in spite of having lozenges at my disposal. And the worst part is, I feel like the nicotine withdrawls are making the episodes more frequent (albeit, low-lying. just incessantly frequent).

Does anybody else experience this? I could really use some advice. I'm determined to kick this habit of mine once and for all, but I've hit a wall.

Thanks, y'all.",6,0

You may remember me from my earlier post about the quarantine / add meds / cigarette hell triangle I've been trapped in.

I did have a question, though: does anyone have advice for easing your body back into cardio post-quitting? Should I go ahead and start now or should I give my lungs a little while to recover / give myself some time to adjust to not smoking before trying to incorporate a new habit?",3,1

Does nicotine gum cause heart palpitations? Like I get weird fluttering in my heart ever since I’ve stopped smoking. 

I’m sitting down playing video games to take the edge off and chewing nicotine gum and doing literally little activity and still feel this.

Also equally as weird, I work out 3 days a week at a gym and don’t notice it really than... only when I’m sitting and hyper-noticing it. I’m a bit of a hypochondriac... to say the least O.o...

Also right before I go to bed when I’m laying down I get it the most. My heart flutters right before I dose off into sleep and than wakes me up. It’s scary because I can actually FEEL it.

The best way to describe it is the more I think about it the more it happens... the less I think about it the easier it is to control BUT still happens. Sometimes their small.. every now and than I get a big palpation that leaves me nervous.

From what I’ve read nicotine can be the cause of this. I also drink a lot of caffeine. Like 10 diet coke’s a day.

The year there was a global pandemic, during which you voluntarily gave up immune function and respiratory capacity? Or will it be the year you chose health over despair?

You cannot control the world, the virus, the chaos of politics.  You can only control yourself.  So take yourself in hand, master your addictions, and become the best possible version of yourself.

Some motivation to quit/stay quit","Hey Reddit, this forum was a great help to me when I first quit so I wanted to post my story here. I know how helpful it can be to read others' stories in the early days of quitting, and how helpful it was to me to stay focused on the massive benefits that come from not smoking. (My parents say vaping is smoking, which is annoying, but it isn't).

Smoked almost 20 years, usually \~15 a day, more if I was out or drinking a lot. I'd tried quitting 10 years ago, lasted a couple days until I went to a bar, then game over for another ten years. Didn't especially want to quit, no health issues, enjoy a smoke, something something individuality and personal freedom. Read Allen Carr but never got to the end. But we all know it's bad for us, so I went on Groupon and got a box mod kit, used it with a strong nic salt at first (turns out this is not advisable). Replaced a few smokes a day with a vape, was planning to ramp it up over time but after 3 days I didn't care to smoke any more and quit for good. I think the big one was replacing the first cig of the day with vape, the ones after that were easier.

If you're reading this, hopefully you've looked up some of the medical timelines about the good things that happen to your body when you quit. Here's what I've found (this is just my journey, yours might be totally different of course):

* Skin got almost immediately clearer, smoother, more elastic. I look younger!
* Tooth sensitivity got better
* I have more energy, joints hurt less
* Psych health is better since I don't need to constantly go out on the street to smoke and feel like an outcast. For the first time in years I had a day where I didn't leave the house. Debatable whether that's ultimately good or not, but you know what, it was my choice to stay in.
* I can ""smoke"" indoors! It feels like years ago when I used to settle down with a few beers and chainsmoke the night away (great for focus). I can do that again.
* I don't smell. My SO still smokes -- no judgment from me about that, I bought her a vape too but I guess she isn't ready yet -- and I can smell it a mile off. Smoking stinks. I don't, neither do my clothes.
* My senses of smell and taste have improved.
* My hair stopped receding and actually got thicker.
* I'm warmer and no longer wear an extra layer compared to most people. I guess it means my circulation improved.
* I save about $200 per month (vape juice $35/mo vs the cost of cigarettes)
* I've been tapering the nicotine in my vape, so at some point it'll go to zero and I can stop e.g. dreading taking long flights anymore.
* No weight loss/gain.
* No irritability; in fact the feeling of freedom from smoking keeps me pretty happy.
* I was expecting to cough up years' worth of black goo. That hasn't happened. Haven't really felt any difference to lung capacity.

Maybe I'll enjoy another cigarette in the future, at some good time with friends who smoke at a bar with a smoking area. I won't promise myself that will never happen - anti-smoking hasn't become a religion for me, everyone's free to choose (I'd still support smokers' rights). But I know I'll never go back to it full-time, and I can confirm that there have been tangible benefits to quitting even after a really short time.

If you're thinking about it or in the first few days, stay strong and keep going! And however long quit you are, if you start wavering, just think ""why would I mess up all my progress by having a cigarette now?""",10,0

Honestly despite smoking for 10 years from a young age, I feel like I can run pretty well, I rarely get out of breath, however I am sure eventually it will catch up to me, and I do cough quite a lot in the mornings.

I would like to hear from others  to get some inspiration to quit. As of right now the thought of quitting puts me in a rather anxious state.

I keep them in too much (all day) but w.e I'm not smoking. I used to chew alot too but my gums started disappearing so I stopped that. I vaped for a minute built my own rigs and coils but that ended up not being for me. Anyway:

My sleven was out of zyn so I tried a brand called rogue. Different feel but worked just the same. After a day or two I noticed them being a little red when I spit them out. I went to check in the mirror and I had blood blisters on my gums. I poked them and found I was losing chunks of my gums again. Faster than when I chewed copenhagen all day. (I brush with sonicare and floss twice a day.) I threw the rest of the pouches away and picked up some ZYN. No more gum loss. I would NOT recommend rogue pouches to anyone. 

A note: I also messed around with a brand called dryft for a bit and they were fine. They come with 20 pouches via zyn's 15. I got the dryft online and the tins have a place to put pouches when you're done with them. The zyn is just the most convenient thing for me.",3,0

Anyway, do you guys know the benefits I am going to start noticing as the days go by? I know that I can google these, but I am also looking for some moral support! Thanks!!",3,2

I had quit smoking for 5 weeks and was really pleased with myself. I could feel that life was much better without them- my exercising improved, lung function much better, also just felt better about myself in general. I have a tendency to beat myself up and being able to say ‘hey, at least I didn’t smoke’ when I was being down on myself really helped me, genuinely.

Friday I had a bit of a wild feeling in me, on of those days when you think ‘I am going to have. few tonight.’ Anyway, I went to the pub, which I had done lots of times since quitting smoking,  and suddenly boom, after a couple of pints, major cigarette cravings. What’s weird is that had obviously happened with alcohol before but I remembered I didn’t want to smoke so ignored and soon the feeling passed. But that day, for some reason my whole motivation had disappear. It was like it didn’t matter anymore, ANYTHING for that cigarette. 

Has anyone experienced anything like this? Is it a sort of complacency that happens when you feel to chilled about your quit?

Also, how to I get myself back into the right mindset. Should I beat myself up over it so I don’t do it again, or see it as a learning curve or something like that...

Thanks guys,

Dom",1,0

Will it hurt?,"So I started off as a ‘social’ smoker in my teens and as I got older, i used to smoke occasionally during stressful times. Only usually lasted a few weeks here or there so no crazy damage.

a couple of years ago, I went to Asia to travel where cigs are really cheap and a lot of people around me smoked. And I was really stressed, anxious and depressed for a lot of reasons. Put two and two together - I must have been smoking 5-10 a day.

When I got back home to the UK, I thought I’d quit by winding down the volume and eventually stop. I was naive thinking I wasn’t addicted and it was just part of boredom and a habit I’d picked up. But I was wrong. It became a trigger for me to smoke whenever I felt shame, pain or anxiety. It used to be exercise or meditation or something - but it was quickly replaced by that sweet hit of nicotine.

Then things got worse for me for a variety of reasons which aren’t important here - but it didn’t help my smoking habit. I just thought to myself ‘fuck it’ I enjoy it, it gives me relief, it’ll only be for a short time - what’s the harm? I never got addicted before, I won’t now. Well that didn’t last.

So as my lungs started to fuck me, I saw a documentary about Juuls and vaping and I thought - yeah that sounds like a good idea. Lol. Nope.

The problem with vapes is that they don’t end. You can literally hit it all the time, anywhere, everywhere. In secret a quick hit? Not an issue. In a bathroom or outside the window if you have 30 seconds. It’s not like a cigarette which you have to make time for. And that was an issue as I kept hitting the damn thing all fucking day.

I become addicted to nicotine. A slave to it. It made me feel shit (anxious, difficult breathing, hard to exercise etc) and it didn’t stop me.

After trying to quit 3 times over the past 9 months or so - I’ve finally managed to not inhale any nicotine for 3 months. Not one drag. But over the past 4 weeks, everyday I’ve wanted a cigarette. Some days the desire is stronger than others but I’ve always told myself if you still want one tomorrow, knock yourself out. Alongside reminding myself how crap I felt when I did smoke etc.

It’s kept me going smoke free so far but everyday I’m consumed by the thought of it. I haven’t left the house in days because I’m afraid I’ll end up giving in and smoking - and then hating myself for it.

I don’t really know what to do. Part of me wants to think I won’t ever pick it up again (as I feel better without them), another part of me is telling me I can have one or two when I really need it and it’s not an issue or that dangerous. Although I’ve read from lots of posts here that it’s a lie.

Idk sorry I’m just ranting. At least writing this out let another craving pass so if nothing else, that’s a plus :)

Stay strong people. I never thought I’d be addicted to cigarettes when I was younger but here we are.",3,0

When I first started my quit, I was literally just getting through the day. I was swamped with anxious and depressing thoughts that I’d never experienced before. I have always been anxious but depression is not something I have ever experienced until now. At around 5-6 weeks I felt a lot lighter and a lot better all of a sudden. I felt like that was it, I’d beat the smoking monster and I was on my way to improved mental health. I wasn’t experiencing depressing thoughts, was enjoying my job and not feeling so anxious.

A little setback a few days ago seems to have made my mood completely change again. Something distressing happened to me - someone I know has been harassing me - and I became extremely anxious. I was clenching my jaw and back again as I did early on in my quit and struggling to sleep a wink. Since this happened, I have felt anxious one day and depressed the next alternately. I also haven’t been sleeping well which always affects me quite badly. I don’t think I am properly depressed exactly as these feelings come and go, and I’m out and about and sometimes feel absolutely fine, but sometimes I just feel absolute dread and despair. I’m terrified for my future, scared I won’t get to do what I want to do and will be unhappy forever. It’s so strange how one day I feel hopeful for the future, and the next feel complete dread about it. 

I’m just wondering if these mood swings are normal at this stage. It’s been 7 weeks now and I’m struggling to find hope that I will start to feel better.",3,0

My first quit attempt was made with my boyfriend, who's been way more determined than me and hasn't backtracked like I did. I don't smoke in front of him because I don't want him to worry, and also because I'm ashamed.

Today he left for a one-week trip. An hour after he left I went down the road and bought a pack of cigarettes. 5.40 € wasted. Smoked half the pack  through the night out of spite, because I could, because no one could stop me. 

Well, now I feel like shit. My throat is filled with phlegm, I am nauseated, my head hurts and I'm way too dizzy to do anything but lie in bed, even though I would have liked to spend the night painting.

I am tired of doing this to myself. My family has a history of smoke addiction, lung cancer, hypertension... The possibility of getting sick in the long term is very real for me. I cannot afford that. Not for this stupid, nonsensical habit.

I don't understand it as soon i bought a vape i immediately quit smoking. But why do people keep smoking cigs when there is definitly a MUCH better alternative, don't they know how harmfull cigs actually are? .. Is it because the news spread false rumours that vaping is dangerous even though only 10 people or so died from vaping and its been around since 2003?

The tobacco industry is doing a good job spreading false rumours to people that vaping is extremely bad and will kill you instantly at one point i've got tons of friends who just believe the media and just continue smoking cigs..

And if you keep smoking cigs yeah it actually becomes a habit but thats what tobacco industry wants right ?

I've done so much research on vaping because i was also believing them.But now im NOT and i watched this video below (which i recommend doing) and it made me even more hate smoking cigs and also the fake corrupt media!

I went to the garage and got it checked & that process was pretty boring. 

However, only tonight I realise that I didn’t think of smoking even once during that entire period of panic or boredom. I have had lesser troubles in past and I would just run to the nearest smoking joint even before addressing the issue.I smoked cigarettes to pass time. I would do that while smoking and I assumed that smoking helped me stay calm and think clearly. One more myth busted!

since i have this weekend to myself, i was considering getting a pack as a treat.  at this point i know i can smoke just one pack, or even half a pack and throw the rest out, but i don't like how pushy cigarettes are.  i just don't need the monkey on my back while i'm trying to enjoy myself.  if cigarettes were a person, i wouldn't invite them over for the weekend.

I'm a non-smoker, never have and never will, however all my family members smoke, a lot.

Because of this, my room (and the entire house) gets filled with smoke. If I close my door it seeps through the gaps, I open a window, it comes from their window into mine. 

So, I'm wondering if anyone here has a recommendation to something that will keep their smoke out of my room?",1,0

A smoker has 50% less chance to have any heart diseases if he/she immediately quits. They see a phenomenal sign of betterment of their heart, blood pressure and less risk.

With quitting smoking, it is also important to keep a healthy diet, moderate exercise and maintaining a healthy cholesterol level. 

The first thing you need to work on is the Mindset and study a path of smoke-free journey with your own discretion. 

It's not a rocket science. It's a commonsense.

Does anyone have any tips that worked when reducing the patch strength? I tried the mini nicotine mints and the chewing gum the first day but they made me feel sick.

I'm half considering smoking for the next week without a patch as a sort of reset and then stop going straight to the mid strength patches. But then this is just going to happen again come the next time.

After spending a week suffering from extreme acid reflux among other intestinal issues, I finally decided to stop smoking. I currently use a juul-like vape thing that successfully replaced cigarettes for me. At first it almost seemed too good to be true... and it was! 

I started developing minute issues with my general well-being such as difficulty of breathing, indigestion, acid reflux, random pains... etc...

So you might ask me what the problem is... I seem pretty determined to quit and I know myself pretty well. I’d say I’ve got some level of self control that can be improved.

My main problem is that while I’m writing this at 7 AM (haven’t gone to sleep yet), I’m a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERSON than the guy who’s gonna wake up in a few hours. It’s not a clinical case of schizophrenia or anything, but all this determination, anxiety, fear of repercussions... etc is completely gone by the time I wake up.

I absolutely hate morning me... morning me is an asshole who’s doing everything within his power to keep inspired late night me from reaching his potential. I’m hoping that I’m gonna wake up later, read a bunch of comments on similar experiences and that it’ll help me stay focused and stay on target. And more importantly, keep morning me from taking charge of my day.",1,0

I started at age 21 as a ‘full-time’ smoker. Now I am 24 and tried countless times to quit with vapes, nicotine gum, patches, etc... all relapsing again with smoking.

The main 3 relapse causes are: lack of sleep, hunger and stress.

I am gonna eat whatever I want for the next 30 days while I go the gym everyday. I am tired of being a slave and wasting my beauty and life on these sticks.

Gonna sleep a ton and gonna avoid all stress, and
kill my stress with saunas which I gonna take everyday.

It’s now a days weird to be a smoker, people disgust you, when they see you...

It kills your beauty, if you smoke for too many years your face gets fucked up. If you see 30 people over the age of 40 you can clearly see who are smokers.

However, those who quit for a few years, you can’t see the difference between who is has been a non-smoker their whole lives.

It’s never to late, the best next time is now.

That’s what I am going to do. I am so proud of you all making great progress in this sub-reddit.

Keep on going, I will be the next non-smoker who quits cold turkey.

Keep on going. I will keep updating this thread with daily comments on how I feel and what makes me crave a cigarette. At some point during the quit, the crocodile brain takes over. 

So, I will keep my personal journal in here. So I can see how stupid and irrational my brain can be.

In 3-months time my dopamine levels are back as a non-smoker. 

To keep my dopamine levels up, I will do a ton of exercises, eat whatever I want. Deplenished of dopamine can hit major triggers. Gotta keep these levels up.

Supplements I will be taking everyday that will help me with being relaxed, and keeps my brain rational are. 5-HTP, L’Theanine, Omega-3, GABA, vitamin-c, and a multivitamin.

I will keep my progress over here. If you have quit already, great job I am so proud of you!

This is intended towards those who are already on antidepressants but aren't getting significantly better.

Full disclosure, this isn't an average MDD trial as we are using a drug similar to ketamine and psilocybin (known classically as hallucinogens).

Good luck to everyone regardless!

Once by accident when this new drug called champix was given as a sample to a doctor friend. She gave it to me, and I decided to try it for fun; one week later I didn’t get anything out from smoking, so I sort of stopped since it got boring. 
One stressful project 6months later made me have one, just one cigarette in order to “focus”. Of course it led to more and before I knew it, I was back to 10+ a day. 

When we got pregnant, expecting my first daughter I made a vow to quit, at LATEST on her arrival. 
Was without for some time, succeeded pretty nicely and though.. No, I KNEW I was in control. So much in control that I also knew that I could smoke one or two at parties, like those of my friends that actually can, but no. Don’t know how and when,but all of a sudden I was smoking like I’d never quit.

Around that time(4y ago) I was always stressed at work. I didn’t see my self as depressed, just grownup problems that everyone goes through after uni becoming an “adult”. 
Albeit, I was always looking for reasons to be happy: if I just mange this, or solve that or achieve... it was a spiral of unhappiness that I failed to see. 

When nothing made me feel better I knew that having kids would make me see the meaning of life. You know, the ultimate transformation, a sacrifice, allowing life to have a purpose. I always wanted kids so when my daughter was born I was of course joyful and it was the best day of my life in many ways, but I was saddened to realise that it wasn’t a emotional life changing event. I’m quite pragmatic so honestly, I was disappointed. Not of having kids but disappointed in me not feeling that “thing” that other dads describe. 

I even started to believe that I had sociopathic tendencies, adding the fact that I slept very little due to the baby didn’t help. 

I was diagnosed with a semi-severe depression. even though second opinions have stated that it was most likely a burnout, it was shit. But the cigarettes was there to help, my only escape from the grey mist of meaningless.  

Fast forward. I got out, became happy again and have accepted that two years of my life went down the drain. Yes, I came out stronger but I would do anything to get those years back. 

During those years my stomach was quite upset. I blamed the stress at work, I blamed my new-dad  situation with irregular sleep, I blamed my “depression”. But when I later actually became happy, mindful and positive, I even got lucky enough to get a second daughter, I realised that even though everything was “zen”, my bowel behaviour wasn’t. I Went to the doctor and got diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, IBD. 

This was hard for me. I always been the healthy one, never getting colds and more or less immune to stomach flue. 
Now I was “constantly sick”. 
It was difficult to accept. even though it is: common, something one can live with, not necessarily dangerous; a medication for life would make things better - compared to having to go to the toilette 4-5 times a day. 
When getting angry, frustrated or fighting with my wife on the topic the cigarettes always calmed me down and made me see things in perspective. 

I’m a small business owner and Covid-19  affected me a lot. All work disappeared and I wasn’t even sure if we would be able to keep the house. Panicking that I would have another burn out the cigarettes was as usual, calming me down. Enjoying the gardening treating you with a cigarette brake and having a cup of coffee&cigarette in the morning was the highlight of the day. 

I was barely coping with all shit when a follow up blood work from the IBD showed irregularities in my kidney values. Turned out that I have kidney failure. My both kidneys are down to 20% of their function. I’m fucking 34 but have kidneys like a a 85 year old. And the bowel thing, and fucking corona. 

Both my doctors told me to quit smoking. Not like immediately, to avoid too much stress at once. I wanted to quit but I couldn’t bare my self to even try. My wife nagged that NOW, with all my deceases I HAD to quit. I knew, but despite the shame a kept on smoking. I even smoked more. 20 day easily and I even went up to “reds” from smoking lights, “if I get more nicotine per cigarette I will smoke less”.

The doctors can’t tell if the two auto immune diseases are connected or not. Nor can they say whether it’s been going on for long- or a short time. 

But even though you know your life expectancy has gone down, that you need to change diet, change a lot of everyday habits - you accept. You are a fighter, you don’t give up, you want to see your kids growing up and meet the grandkids; but fuck me sideways is it difficult to quit smoking. 

The white stick of lies that constantly reminds me that I need them to calm down, to prevail the stress. 

Five days ago I turned 35. I started taken a new subscription on champix (since it worked once before) 7 days earlier. Today on the 1st of October was suppose to be the first day that I would be smoke free.

I have now been five days without a single cigarette. I’m not proud yet, but give it another week and I’ll be proud as one can be. I’m even listening to Allen Carr’s “Stop Smokinge Now”. 

This wasn’t supposed to be a long post. I just wanted to share that I’m now one more small person with a big bag of shameful behaviour joint this sub. A new member that has quit smoking!",4,5

Before in previous attempts I have told myself you can have whatever you want as long as you don't smoke.

Where as this time, I feel really differently about it and I feel like it's an opportunity to incorporate things I wouldn't usually have done so that I can *feel* the difference not smoking makes to running for example.

So I'm thinking for the month of Oct I will do at least 30 mins of exercise every day and yoga as well as stopping smoking.

Also trying to cut down social media have only kept reddit and WhatsApp.

Let me know if you achieved similar or think this is too much and should focus solely on not smoking
