1. Exercise won't happen today, I actually couldn't sleep last night. I don't think I fell asleep until around 7am??? Just got up around 12-12:30ish because of someone at the door.  
2. I got a HORRIBLE HORRRRRRRRRIBLE sore throats. The kinds were it even hurts to just clear my throat.  Mix that with the annoyance of the ""tickle"".......when really it isn't a tickle we all know this.

Good news

1. Feeling like I was getting bit last night in bed, we've had the nightmare of bedbugs before but not at this place. We've been bug free for 6 or 7 years? The pest control did a heat treatment but they are EXPENSIVE (1500 dollars) for 1 treatment.  I was kinda panicy, stressed, if you've ever had these things and then get bit at night again you do! Well a pest control expert came out and said he does not see any signs of bedbugs but with our cats it might be fleas.   I'm actually grateful for this! It's not bedbugs! Give me anything else just not bedbugs!
2. I get paid tomorrow! Isn't that always a good thing? Actually the husband does but what his is mine too right? We might get some fireworks, small amount, and enjoy. I already got popcorn here.  The best part, to watch city fireworks we never have to leave our yard.  If we go out in the backyard we can see them pretty clear and beautiful so we get popcorn and our chairs.",2

I'm on day 8 of no nicotine, actually by 1pm today it'll be 8 days officially and I feel awful.
The good news is I don't want to have another cigarette. The bad news is I've been waking up feeling anxious right when I wake up and randomly throughout the day.

Also about 4 days after quitting I started to have heart palpitations and they haven't fully gone away yet. This happened to me last year when I traded cigarettes for vape for about 6 months and then stopped vaping.  It took a couple of weeks for the palpitations to finally stop(I was vaping at least 2 Juul pods a day, doctors told me nothing was wrong and it was most likely from nicotine withdrawals) no tightness of breathe and no pain. 

Anyway I'm here mostly because it's supposed to help my anxiety by talking about it, also I've never had anxiety before until the past year and a half. I'm sure I'm leaving out details to my story since I'm having difficulty focusing at the moment so I apologize if my post seems like it's all over the place.

I'm just trying to find some sort of answer for how long are these withdrawals going to last, to how long until this anxiety goes away?

Thank you all for reading this. I really appreciate any and all help.

Take care

Update: went to an Urgent Care for heart palpitations. They took blood, x-rays, EKG. They said even though I'm having irregularly irregular palpitations my heart is fine and it should go away on its own. It brought be some relief but of course one can't help but to panic a bit when they become lost in their own thoughts.  I have noticed though that as long as I'm not focused on it, whether it's by watching a move or playing video games, then I actually feel normal until I realize I feel normal and then I start to feel the palpitations more and more ......what a vicious cycle. Anyway I have an appointment with my primary doctor in 3 days to see what she says in regard to my heart and this new found anxiety I have. Boy oh boy what a ride this has been.",9

I've been 4 days free of tobacco, and I stopped it cold turkey. I'm finding it hard because I grew up with it, I started when I was 14-15, and now I'm nearly 19, and I'm finding it hard. 

I'm struggling with four things:

1) I didn't usually get mad before, but now for some reason, I'm finding hard to keep anger in me. Even emotions, like I would always smoke when I was pissed at something, and now I don't know what to do without it. 

2) Is normal to forget things way more then usual, like I literally don't remember any details from the past week, it's like I'm struggling to remember things. Yesterday I was really sick, I was extremely lost, but didn't give in. 

3) You know like when you had nothing to do, you would usually be like ""let me smoke"". Now I'm struggling to fill this ""moment"" in, my subconscious kicks in saying go smoke, but then I say no, but I don't know what to replace it with. I tried ignoring it, but I spotted the urge just gets stronger. 

4) Is it me or does time pass by differently. Time is flying by really fast, and I'm not noticing it.

Any advice would be appreciated tbh

I totally got this.  I just need to remember a year from now ""aw, just one won't be a problem!""  (Narrator:  Yes, yes it will be, lol)

When I quit I thought ""This is gonna suck for a spell"" and it did.  Does, even, but the brain fog, the thing I hate the most, is starting to lift a little.

As I've posted a million times here in the past 4 days the thing that gets me through is I know the cravings are BECAUSE of my friend Nicky O'Tine, and having a smoke is NOT the solution to them.  The only way these cravings go away is by never feeding them again.

Get that mindset and it is a lot easier to get through a bad craving.  And maybe giving it a name helps, beats me.  Just had a helluva craving and thought, verbatim, ""Oh fuck off, Nicky"" and boom, the desire to smoke was instantly gone and the craving passed really easily.

Also bear in mind your brain will do all SORTS of things to rationalize smoking again.  Don't trust it.  No, your stress levels are not too high.  No, you do not ""love to smoke"" no matter how much you think you do.  Your addiction is just playing your brain like a fiddle and it is your enemy - treat it like one.

I reckon I'll post again at 1 week.

I‚Äôm a heavy smoker who hasn‚Äôt had a smoke in 3 days now. I bought some low nicotine Snus and have used it maybe 3 times a day. Kinda walks me away from the cliff of caving into smoking again.

I‚Äôve tried everything is the past and know that I need nicotine replacement until I break my habit of physically smoking. Problem is the patch makes me sick, the gum burns too much and the inhaler makes me cough worse than smokes. So far the Snus is giving me hope that I can get through this. I‚Äôve got some personal rules like I can‚Äôt run to the Snus when I have an intense craving, I only use it once I‚Äôve controlled myself, don‚Äôt use it in the same situation I would smokes (waking up, after eating, sex, etc).

Does anyone have any success using this method? I plan to taper down slowly off the stuff but for the moment getting off cigarettes is the single most important thing to me, nicotine addiction will come next (and I‚Äôm using 90% that I was 3 days ago)",3

I stopped smoking without even planning to. (4 yrs smoker),"I started using bupropion for something completely unrelated to smoking (some personal issues, psychiatrist prescribed me these meds). I wasn't even planning to stop smoking, but I've been on these meds for about two weeks now and I went down from maybe 10 cigarettes a day to no cigarettes or a maximum of 1 cigarette a day. This all happened in 2 weeks and it came gradually. 

I work full time and I used to smoke a lot due to work related stress and now I can go an entire day without thinking about lighting up a cigarette. Even when I think about having a cigarette, the craving is so numbed down that I don't make the effort of rolling up a cigarette to smoke one. Hiding my tobacco gear in a box in my drawer helps a lot so I don't think about it. I also stopped caffeine some weeks ago and I think not drinking coffee anymore or drinking decaf helped a lot, because for me coffee was inseparable from smoking for all this time. I'd have a coffee and cigarette before breakfast every morning.

I ran out of tobacco 2 days ago and I don't have enough ""nicotine motivation"" to go buy more.

I still don't consider this a victory, I think we should never do that until we are several months in no tobacco. But I feel like I'm on the right track. I cannot wait to give my family the good news as soon as I am completely confident that my addiction is gone. They are also smokers and I hope it will especially motivate them to stop smoking.",8

Let‚Äôs do a small experiment. Imagine you have no idea as to what is smoking and have never heard of tobacco in your entire life. You have seen no movies where actors use cigarettes, haven‚Äôt stumbled upon any kinds of advertisements endorsing smoking, and have never met a single person ever putting something in his mouth, torching it, and throwing a puff of smoke into the atmosphere.¬†

Basically, your memory revolving around smoking is eviscerated. Now, if I come to you and show you a small cylindrical container that consists of some burnable content and ask you to put it between your teeth and light it up, what would you do?

Well, naturally you will ask, ‚ÄúWhy would I do that? What‚Äôs in it for me?‚Äù

Then I‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúHonestly, nothing much. You‚Äôd probably kill yourself in all honesty if you keep doing that.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWell, WTF?!!?!? Why would you give me such a thing and why would anyone ever buy anything like that on God‚Äôs Green Earth?‚Äù

‚ÄúBusiness, baby. Oh, and did I forget to mention that it also looks cool? And you know the fun part? Our customers are pretty chill with it. I mean dude, we literally say on our packaging that ‚ÄòSmoking Kills‚Äô and yet our business is booming.‚Äù

‚ÄúWow man, that‚Äôs insane. I wish I could also create a product like this with such an amazing pull. I mean, holy shit dude! Salesmen talk about all kinds of fake advantages their product can offer and people don‚Äôt give a shit, and here you are, literally telling people that they may die and people buy like crazy. What a time to be alive!‚Äù

The conversation is likely going to go someway like that. But seriously, it intrigues the shit out of me that how does a product‚Äîcontaining chemicals which are also found in insecticides, mothballs, rat poison, batteries, rocket fuels, nail polish remover, hair dye‚Äîgain such massive popularity(over a billion people) and gave rise to a multi-billion dollar industry?¬†

First of all, I quit smoking about 2 months ago. However, the way it worked out was sort of weird. I am 22 and I moved in with a relative near my summer job in a different state. While I do have to resist sneaking out and buying a vape or cigs or whatever, it is definitely different than having it offered to me or even just being around it. I have been exercising a ton and am in great shape, and overall not smoking has been an incredible improvement to my life. However, I still have cravings all the time, pretty much just thinking about the insane head rush I‚Äôd get. 

So that kinda leads into my questions: 

1) how can I prepare myself for transitioning back into the real world where I live by myself and am more easily able to smoke and use nicotine?

2) Do the cravings ever fully go away?",3

I was heavily smoking for about 8 years. I first tried quitting cigs in 2018 but relapsed after 3 Months. I gained  some weight and postponed another attempt to stop for over one year because I feared gaining more. Finally I didn't let the fear of weight gain stop me any longer. 

I have to remind myself that I can be incredibly proud of what I accomplished and you can be too. For every day you manage! Here are 3 tips I have for all you strong and brave quitters out there that helped me:

1. Try to surround yourself with people that don't smoke. This helped me a great deal in the initial time when I stopped especially because people who don't smoke still enjoy their coffee and a night out. So I managed to do that as well. 
2. Consider yourself a non-smoker for good. For me it was crucial to not start with the whole 'I'll stop for now, let's see what happens in 3 months` attitude and it helped me to be smoke free for that long. I knew, if I ever started with'just one' I'd fall right back
3. Anticipate the urges! I don't know if its actually scientifically backed but when i wondered why I got such strong urges about 1 month after and then again after 3 months quitting the first time, I read that the by-poduct nornicotin is being degraded in 3 month intervals for up to 1 year after stopping. No matter if this is true or not, anticipating strong urges to come for a longe time, made it easier to stay strong for me. 


I'm wishing all of  you a great day and stay strong. It's sooooo worth it üôè",23

I'm a 26f and had smoked since I was 15, and was one of those clearly addicted people who you could never imagine quitting. My mom smoked my whole life, and when I was young I even associated the smell with her and therefore protection and care. As a smoker myself, I loved the social aspect at parties, etc. I had always seemed to accept that I was an inevitable smoker, and it would be this way my entire life. 

And then in January 2021 I was supposed to have surgery. Smoking is one of the worst things you can do for surgery recovery, so I was told to stop some weeks beforehand as reccomended by the doctor. I just picked a day, threw all of my tobacco and lighters out, and stocked up on snacks. 

Ngl, it was *really* tough.

The cravings were strong in the first few days but I stayed strong. Admittedly, I snacked a lot, but what's a few extra pounds in comparison to dropping one of the most unhealthy things you can do in life? Ice lollies (popsicles) and potato chips were my go-to. I also played a lot of cute semi-addictive strategy games to give my mind something to do. It was great to have that distraction! 

I have to admit though, the thing that kept me going was the noticable impact on my health (mental and physical). My surgery ended up being postponed because of covid but I sticked with the quit nevertheless. After a couple of weeks my breathing was so much better- previously I was literally out of breath going up stairs. Also, my snoring was so much better and my skin was getting less red. 

My boyfriend always disliked me smoking and refused to kiss me after I had smoked. This always gave me an anxious complex around him, but now - we smooch and cuddle whenever and he's also very happy that I'm feeling healthier. I never need to worry about smelling bad when hugging friends.

When pubs and restaurants opened their outdoor seating here in May, it was a bit of a struggle because people were smoking around me and alcohol always gave me the worst cravings. But I soldiered on by remembering the huge benefits to my health. After a few visits to pubs and beer gardens, I no longer associate myself with drinking and needing a smoke. 

Yesterday I was on a bachelorette party the whole day and there were two heavy smokers in the group. Again, it was a tough situation because I was constantly exposed to the smoke (and I was drinking). But I was totally fine and now feel so proud. This was a huge moment for me!

So that's my story - hopefully it helps motivate at least one of you to make the big leap. It was honestly one of the best things I've done in my life and I know you will think the same. And if you're struggling while quitting, just remember all of those amazing benefits you'll have for your own health and wellbeing. You can do this!!",52

I said when I get to this point I‚Äôll make a post detailing some changes I‚Äôve felt in that time . It‚Äôs off the cuff so don‚Äôt pay any attention to it perhaps being all over the place,"1) I don‚Äôt stink of smoke 

2) my skin looks and feels better 

3) my hangovers are so much more manageable 

4) I‚Äôve saved 186¬£ + let‚Äôs say an average of ¬£3 per day not buying coffees from Starbucks 

5) I‚Äôm also not spending money on shore I don‚Äôt need as I‚Äôm not going to the shop as often to buy cigs 

6) I always was a decent runner but fuck me , I‚Äôve improved a lot 

7) I‚Äôm not bookending a meal with a trip to the door - I hated that but not as much as I enjoyed the smoke 
8) I‚Äôm not making excuses to sit outside at restaurants and bars 

9) I‚Äôm no longer the ‚Äúsmoker ‚Äú in my social circle 

10) my breath smells better without the smoke and so much coffee 

11) I can taste food and it feels like I‚Äôve developed a whole new sense 

12) I‚Äôm not as temperamental as I was 31 + days ago 

13) I generally feel better 

14) I‚Äôm no longer causing lung damage to those around me , especially the girl I claim to love but was fucking her up with my smoke . Why are we not calling this domestic abuse cause it fucking is ?! I can see that now . 

15) I can wear the same jumper (sweater)  or jeans a second day in a row because they don‚Äôt stink of smoke 

16) my hands smell like the soap I used hours ago 

17) last but not least .. I‚Äôm not slowly committing suicide anymore 

Hopefully someone somewhere finds one of the 17 reasons above a good reason to even think about quitting 

That‚Äôs it for now .",256

Needless to say, that was my only puff. Never in my life am I going to go through that again. While I was sad that I lost control, I was grateful too since it made me realise how quickly the body starts to recover once you stop giving it nicotine. 

Never smoking again, because my body just told me how painful that is.

I stopped smoking on the 4th of July 2016 and until the 8th of June 2019 I didn't smoke a single cigarette.  I was so confident that I had stopped smoking for good this time as I crossed 1000 days without a single smoke. But unfortunately, I had a re-union with some old friends after 5 years during the weekend of 8th June and I honestly don't know why I picked up a cigarette when offered(it still horrifies me to know how easy it was to pick up, light and smoke one). I assumed it would just be a weekend thing but here I am still smoking after 2 years. I have decided it's finally high-time to put this to bed again and not to flirt with this dangerous habit.

This post is to say that 'never let your guard down, even if you feel like like you have stopped for good'. I feel terrible for picking up that cigarette again.

I'm officially stopping smoking from now. I'm again making a list of things to why I need to stop smoking again and revisit the times when I was a horrible pack-a-day smoker. Wish me luck. Not One Puff Ever again.

Also, how do I reset my badge counter ?",11

A pack of cigs a day, a bag of 5g weed a week... 

At start, it was a blast, but with years passing by, I started (like everyone else here I think) to feel more and more dependant, and less and less enjoying cigarettes. Weed pushed me to **stop doing** a lot of things I liked, especially arts related (like reading, writing, drawing)...

The combo of those two addictions destroyed my self-esteem, confidence, body and mind. **It's a slow process, and you rarely see it before it's too late...** 

This year particully, I started to feel some troubles with my breathing, sleep and most scarier of all ; **heart**. Got some family backgrounds with heart diseases, and the fact that it's starting so soon for me is a sign that I should really stop smoking.  

**I just started the journey yesterday 23:00pm**, after watching posts here everyday for about a year now. **You guys are strong, touching, funny, caring and respectful. Thanks to all of you.** I just woke up after 5h of sleep, with a big craving, and start writing this post for keeping me busy. It work ! 30m writing, no cravings since, ya 'all very usefull for that ;)

After 1 attempt with **e-cig**, 1 with **hypnose** and 3 attempts **cold turkey** with the **Allen Carr method**, I think I finally stop being too ruthless with myself and try this time with 21mg patches, and with the help of an **addiction specialist**. 

**I have to explain this point** : I kinda saw over the last year in this sub a strong defense of Allen Carr's method, like it's the only one that matter. It's not the case and it should not been see like it. Don't get me wrong, it's his book who really open my mind, and break the circle for me. **I hate everything about cigs now**. But I was also thinking that it was the supreme technic, and I no longer gave credits to people stoping with substitutes... I was trully wrong. **Any method is good, It just have to be the one that work for you. Don't be too hard on yourself**. 

Moreover, **no books talk about quitting both weed and tobacco** (I'm from france, and we smokes joints with tobacco, it's a cultural habit I think, so one addiction call the other and it's hopeless to quit one at a time, trust me on that).

**My strongest motivations, for anyone asking (*****and for reminding myself)*** **:**

* **Health**
* **Breath**
* **Boyfriend** *(who is non-smoker and whom I have loved deeply for 3 years)*
* **Family** *(especially mom who tells me to stop smoking every day from the start)*
* **Better sleep** *(I'm an insomniac so cigarettes and weed don't help)*
* **Smell and tasting**
* **Self-love**
* **Physical** *(I'm a phasm actually, I used to be a rugby winger, stopped with weed)* 
* **And Money of course** *(10.50 euros per pack, so 12.53\~ dollars)*

Anyway ! Sorry for the long post, and for bad english (french baguette like I said ahah), I will stay strong and focus, **milestone after milestone**. I don't know if I'm going to post often, but I'm here, lurking for your stories and hope. 

Cheers guys !

**NOT EVEN ONE PUFF  ! NEVER AGAIN !**

*PS: if anyone in this sub feel it's too hard and want to talk about the dual dependance of cannabis and tobacco, feel free to talk to me, Im likely more efficient for helping others than myself ;)*",13

Posting today to let you know we are running a smart meeting in the RedditInRecovery discord! It happens every friday at 9pm central.

If you've ever thought that you need a meeting but you felt that 12 step meetings didnt cater to your specific addiction, smart is probably a good fit for you.

Here's a quick writeup of the program and how the meetings go: SMART (Self-Management And Recovery Training) Recovery

SMART is a generalized non-spiritual/non-religious addiction recovery program that is self-driven, as opposed to standard 12-step style programs, built from science-backed psycho-therapeutic techniques (e.g. CBT/DBT/REBT) that are applied in the context of addiction.

The focus is to help and empower participants by building sensible mental tools as part of their recovery to overcome the logical fallacies, difficulties in emotional regulation and other mental roadblocks that appear during the path to recovery, no matter what stage someone is at (day 1 or day 1000).

The SMART approach is built around ""the 4-point program"":

Building and maintaining the motivation to change.
Coping with urges to use.
Managing thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in an effective way without addictive behaviors.
Living a balanced, positive, and healthy life.

Meetings

SMART meetings are best understood by looking at the meeting format. Unlike other programs, cross-talk (discussion between participants) is encouraged.

The meeting opens with a check-in where everyone one-by-one is invited to speak about how they are today, where they currently are in their recovery, any stressors they'd like to work on and anything else that feels relevant in the present.

    The facilitator will ask people who are dealing with an issue to discuss it, generally inviting other participants to chime in if they have relevant experience or some thoughts, then work with the current person on teaching them (as well as the group as a whole) a tool that is applicable.

The meeting closes with a check out in a similar style to the check-in, where feedback is given to facilitator as well as simple how you feel and anything that may have come up that you want to ask about.

If you'd like to join us for the meeting tonight just click this link >> https://discord.gg/S3gEqnFw

The beautiful part about smart is we focus on the commonalities in all addictive behaviors, smoking, drug usage, drinking, gambling, whatever it is. This program can work for any maladaptive behavior.

Hope to see you there!",2

I‚Äôd like to share some things that have really helped me beat this monster.

-water, water, and more water

-working out, even if it‚Äôs 15 minutes (the adidas training app is fantastic, all at home work outs, no weights needed, it‚Äôs amazing)

-cartoons: idk what it was but watching cartoons really just boosted my mood and calmed me down (I really enjoyed Craig of the Creek and Gravity Falls just fantastic energy and a serotonin boost)

-CBD gummies (no thc) helped calmed the anxiety, zzzquill helped put me to sleep (it is really worth it, just don‚Äôt over do it)

-meditation: great way to find your balance and regain control of your cravings and anxiety 

- trust your support system 

Thanks for reading guys, and feel free to comment things that helped you! I see a lot of people just trying to start the quit, or struggling early and I hope you guys can find some of these helpful :)",16

I commented on a post where one person is wanting to quit smoking, i thought i post it here too to help more. Hear me out:","Hey, in my honest opinion, the best way to quit any bad habit is to go cold turkey. May be you won't succeed at first attempt, you can make a second, a third attempt at quitting cold turkey.   
Few steps i recommend:

* Educate yourself on how much smoking is bad for your body. Also, know the timeline how quitting smoking will affect your body. \[Few resources: [resource1](https://www.quitgenius.com/resources/quit-smoking-timeline) , [resource2](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317956)
* List all the effects you notice it caused on your health
* Write to yourself why you want to quit smoking. A strong reason is mandatory.
* Don't fall for the trap of smoking your last cigarette. There is nothing like that. The last cigarette was the one you already smoked.
* Download a counter app which will count smoke free days for you. I used an app called Smoke Free.
* Remove the ashtray, lighters and packs of cigarette from your home, the places you chill at, your bag, your work space. You won't need that on your journey to better health.
* As much as you can, try to not visit the places where you usually smoke with friends or yourself. Stay away from those coffeshops, smoking areas. 
* Be vigilant for the first 10 days. These are the most difficult ones. Remember, it's not that difficult in front of your will power. 
* Journal everytime you feel the urge and remind yourself the reason why you are quitting and how it's for your betterment.
* Few alternatives when you feel the urge: Sip on green tea, have some candies around to suck on, drink lots of water.
* Remember: Not a single puff again. That's the trap your mind is going to play on you: ""One puff is nothing"".
* Join r/stopsmoking for a community to help you more on your journey and read about others experiences.

I'm sitting here on my birthday, which I should be enjoying, but instead am fighting through some pretty horrible cravings as a result of a recent relapse.

I think the worst thing about relapsing is that you really have to be diligent to get back on the horse. I can't plan ahead for a ""quit date"" or anything like that- it's just trying to get back to normal.

I've lost my way regarding my quit of 4 years over the past couple months, mostly on weekends where I travel for work. And now I'm sitting here on my birthday with horrible cravings because I just couldn't control myself over the past couple weeks. Just a reminder that if you relapse, your cravings will be back almost instantly- and they can really kind of ruin some other plans, which may be a side effect you weren't expecting. I've only smoked a handful of times over the past month, but already I feel like I have to retrain myself how to do certain things.

And the other bad thing is the horrible resentment I feel against the world, because ""I'm not allowed to smoke and it's not fair."" I definitely need to work on these emotions moving forward.",6

In this time I've also stayed away from alcohol for 10 weeks, I'm entering my 7th week on anti anxiety meds which have helped massively and changed me for the better.

I'm enjoying life, I've said this before but it's not just about quitting smoking there are usually other things that need fixing too so it all works together.

Hey /stopsmoking fam.

We're Hazen and as former tobacco smokers who were constantly frustrated by our on-again, off-again nicotine habit, we set out to produce a nicotine- and tobacco-free CBD cigarette to help people kick the habit, once and for all, and combat any unexpected cravings after they quit.

Anyway, we're super passionate about helping people ditch the nico-demon and so we just wanted to drop in, introduce ourselves, and say that we look forward to joining in on the conversation and offering support and advice where we can!

By the way, have any of you had any luck using CBD smokes to help you kick the habit? Let us know or feel free to ask us anything.

In the meantime, keep going and remember‚Äîyou've got this.",1

Once upon a time I used to buy one pack a day because I used to smoke like an old timer train. 
Stressed due to office work? Time for a smoke. Bored from inactivity? Time for a smoke. Feeling productive? Well, let's have a smoke first. There was a time when I hated the taste of the cigarette, but I was unable to throw it away. And even if I do, there would be a new cancer stick lit within the next 10 minutes. I was never able to stop.

When the pandemic happened and my country went to total lockdown, I never thought of stocking up packs. Since shops were open, I can go outside with all precautions and still buy a pack. Well, imagine my disappointment when all the shop owners in my state said the same thing: Cigarette was not considered an essential product, hence we don't have any more packs to sell. The initial days were difficult. It was like an itch but I can't scratch it away. My mouth started salivating. I had no one by my house to ask for just one cigarette to quench my nicotine addiction. I didn't want to go through the nicotine patch phase. So after 1-2 weeks, I started exercising. Even if it was hot summer and sun was beating down its heat, I still put on a brave face and did all the crunches. I never backed out.

After a couple of months, my local place brought in a new batch of cigarettes packs. So after buying a pack, I lit a new one. The familiar smell was tingling and I was excited to put one in mouth after a long and dry spell. But I had to throw that away after a few puffs. Three, to be exact. YES, I threw the whole pack away. I didn't want anything to do with these nicotine rolls.

And it has been a whole year without touching them even once and I feel proud of myself. I never thought I would be able to do this, but I remembered a quote from one of my favourite books: ""The most important step isn't the first one. It's the next step. Always the next step""

I implore to my fellow sub redditors. Once you have embarked on this beautiful journey, it will be imperative to not look back. Remember, always the next step.",30

But I realized. I love smoking. I fucking love it. I love the action itself, the habit/ritual, the feeling of smoke going into my lungs and of course the buzz. Even when I first quit, a year and a half of not touching any nicotine, I still craved it almost every single day. 

But at the same time it disgusts me. I hate walking into a room knowing I smell like smoke, I hate feeling like shit until I smoke my first cig, I hate how it makes my lungs feel and how it's destroyed my cardio. I hate feeling like a slave to it, yet none of this can override the desire I have to commit to the action, the habit, etc.

Obviously, I know how bad it is for my health and very few of my friends/family smoke cigarettes (but a lot vape). However, at this point it feels ingrained into my life. I tried to write down all my ""triggers"" and just gave up because literally everything I could think of made me want to smoke. 

How do I start to change the way i feel about smoking and separate it from my life? 

Anyone with similar feelings/experiences that have any words of advice?

It started as just something I do occasionally, then daily, then before I know it I am going through 10 sticks a day. So I say to myself, I should decrease the amount I smoke, which turns out to be a very very bad decision, because instead of reducing my cravings and addiction, I am thinking about a cigarette all day, and awaiting the time for smoking with anticipation.

I also made a pact with a friend when I was 19 , that if he didn't smoke for 10 days I won't for 20. Suffice to say, it didn't turn out well, at the 10th day he smoked 1 cigarette in front of me even though he hadn't the whole 10 day. I went on strong for 9 days however I soon learned that he had cheated, which gave me an excuse to break the pact, in hindsight it would have been a very good time to stop I was really motivated at the time. Anyways I stopped worrying about quitting and kept putting it off, thinking to myself it would get easier when I am married, or if I have children I would stop for their sake etc.

Fortunately, I stumbled upon this sub, and the stories motivated me to try once more, but with better preparation, I learned about Allen Carr and his book, which I completed yesterday. I followed each and every instruction, and today is my second day without smoking, its been 18h 3m since I last smoked. I don't feel much craving, a tiny bit restless but otherwise I feel very happy. I do get the occasional thoughts about cigarettes in my mind, but I have a very strong and good feeling, that yesterday was the last time I will ever smoke.

Thanks for reading so far, I apologize for any mistakes in my prose. If you are in a similar situation as me, then good luck and wish me the same.",10

I made this post to share with you that after 60days of not smoking I have been able to think more clearly, the best thing that has happened is I have patience now, I don‚Äôt feel the need for instant rewards anymore, I can breathe better, my skin is better and theres almost no head aches. 
Ask yourself 2 questions:
why did I start smoking? 
why do I want to stop smoking? 
and one of the most important question is :
What are the benefits of quitting? 

Believe me the benefits alone are the biggest motivation and enough to get you out the gravitational pull of the first few days, after that you will just be floating in space, however there will always be urges but all you have to do is ask yourself the 2 questions once again and then chose what you wanna do.",28

1. Nicotine replacement therapy did not and will not work for me. If it works for you great, but for me it kept my addiction to nicotine alive and waiting for my next cigarette.
2. Read Allen Carr‚Äôs Easyway to quit smoking. I know the book is dumb and has weird analogies but I went in it with the belief that it would work for me no matter what and it did. I don‚Äôt care if it was a placebo effect, it still worked.
3. I have 6 years clean and sober and this was my last vice. I tried everything but I‚Äôve now realized that I just hadn‚Äôt hit a bottom with smoking. Now I see smokers hiding in alley ways smoking and I feel bad for them because I understand and I am so happy I am not living like that anymore.
4. I practiced a sort of mindfulness when I had a craving. Before when I would try and quit I would obsess over the want of smoking. The thought would pop into my heat and I would stew over it until I was driving myself crazy. This time I would think about smoking and tell myself ‚Äúnot right now‚Äù and do something else. It helped tremendously.

I am sure there are many other things I am missing and I am happy to further share my experience to anyone who needs it. Good luck all!",42

I'm going to copy and paste part of a comment I left on another thread that best describes how I feel..

""Nicotine addiction is the worst. I've  been sober from drinking for almost 8 months and life is has been so  much better. Now it's felt like time to quit the smoking, but it's been  so tough.

I keep saying I'll quit  tomorrow, that I'll finish what I have and try the next day, but I  without thinking will just go to the store and buy them, thinking I'll  need one for later, and then just smoke regardless.

Even  writing this I realize how much nicotine addiction has enslaved me. The  fact that I want something so bad, something that wrecks my sleep, my  mood, makes my body ache and feel breathless, just shows me how bad it  is.

Again, even as I write this and talk about how crappy it makes me feel, I want to light up.""

I should add I only mentioned some of the cons of smoking, because there is so many more, but I can't understand how I want to continue smoking, except that I'm addicted. 

I'm at the point where I keep telling myself everyday that I'll quit tomorrow, but like today I just went to the store to get some for no reason other than I thought I'd need it.

I have read about half way through Allan Carrs book and should pick it back up, and I saw a helpful app..

But anyways,

I was able to quit thanks my willpower as I actually wanted to at that point and was 100% convinced. Of course the withdrawal was bad in the beginning but it calmed down gradually and I got definitely over it at the 2 months mark I'd say.

Now, things are getting difficult. I thought I had it all cleares out but back in may everything opened and we started going out again trying to live a normal life. That's when things started to get complicated for me, the revival of my social life somehow made me crave cigarettes even though I didnt think about it for a few months. Everytime I see someone smoke, I just want to light one as well. It's getting to the point where every day I get this intense craving, and I have to convince myself that I just need to get through this, but it starts over the day after!

The runner running past me just gave me a dirty look, ugh now I have to go home and change so I don‚Äôt smell like smoke, what‚Äôs the point of this again? 

I think the farther we move away from cigs, the more we forget how pointless and unfulfilling they are. We remember them as all being like the first one of the day‚Äîbut they‚Äôre not. 

I haven‚Äôt reset my timer because I haven‚Äôt stopped being a non-smoker. I had a slip up and finally realized that I am much more confident and happy being a non-smoker. I swear smoking has contributed so much to my depression, my insecurity.

For those of you on your quit journey, stick with it. I PROMISE you that it‚Äôs not worth it to go back.

To all you out there starting the quit, YOU CAN DO IT.

2021-06-22 23:24:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/o64i29/romanticizing_nonsmoking/,Romanticizing non-smoking,"You know how sometimes you catch yourself idealising and romanticizing smoking? Having coffee with a cigarette, or after a meal, or smoking at the window reminiscing looking at the rain, or smoking and drinking outside the bar and socialising with all the other smokers, or smoking and driving? Or even regressing to thinking that smoking makes you cool, like the poor but handsome philosophy student chain-smoking while writing fuck-the-system essays on his typewriter, lol, that type of thing?

Well, I'm seven months in after having smoked for 20 years and a couple failed quitting attempts, and I catch myself having such thoughts occasionally, well knowing that the *real* struggle is just about to begin. True, the cravings are few and far between and easy to cope with, I've decoupled every previous behaviour that I would normally associate with smoking (like the things I mention above) from the act itself so I'm not triggered easily any more, but the romanticizing aspect is coming back with full force. Being not as vigilant any more as in the beginning, when I had just stopped - because, let's be honest, it *is* exhausting - I feel that the danger of slipping up in a moment of weakness is real and just around the corner.

So, I reversed the game. I will preface this by saying that this is probably predominantly a male perspective, but I'd be more than happy to hear similar coping mechanisms for other genders. It's also probably worth mentioning that I've read Allen Carr and found it very helpful.

In those moments of weakness I've started romanticizing non-smoking instead. Yes, we all know about how it's more healthy, how you breathe easier, how the risk of cancer and heart disease decreases each time you don't smoke a cigarette, blablabla, but honestly, how ""cool"" is that? Not very, and idealising the act is at least in parts about ""coolness"". So then think, who is cooler, the hipster who can't do even a single pull up or somebody who looks like Chris Heria and does muscle ups for breakfast? The smoking DJ who will shit his pants in a street fight or the MMA figher who won't give a fuck? David Goggins who can run 200 miles or you, the smoker, who needs to take a break and catch your breath after bringing in the groceries?

Basically, start idealising physical and mental fitness instead. Put a concrete face to it. Imagine yourself being tough, being in control, being able to overcome whatever life throws at you. It may be childish, but have an idol you want to be like when you ""grow up"". Like Khabib, McGregor, whatever, it's cool. Start exercising, lifting weights, training sports or martial arts. When you stand outside socialising with the smokers, look at their beer bellies and think, what's cool about that? Observe the fidgety co-worker who can't wait to run outside for a smoke, being completely powerless and not in control of his will, and think, what's cool about that? And so on.

Mind you, I'm not advocating for feeling smug or superior to other people; rather, for me at least, this is a way to start associating smoking with its real effects on the mind and body and to start romanticizing non-smoking instead. I hope it is also rather obvious that this is an over-generalisation and there are many fit smokers who will absolutely kick your ass or outrun you or whatever, but I also hope that the point I'm trying to make is clear enough - that non-smoking *is* cool, if you put it in the right context.

I hope this helps somebody, and I'd be glad to hear any other perspectives and ideas you fine people may have!",131

I ended up with symptoms anyway.

I've tried quitting so many times and it never sticks. I get so irritated and angry every time I try to stop. I always use nicotine to calm down when I am anxious, angry or overwhelmed. I can never stick to it and always end up punishing the people around me whenever I try to stop. Does anyone have any recommendations on how to deal with this? Did anyone have this type of relationship with nicotine? It doesn't matter if it's gum or vape or cigarettes or patches. I have no idea how to manage myself without this shit and I'm over it.

I am a day in here. I once made it three years and then picked up smoking again during the pandemic. Sigh.

Anyways, before walking into my office this morning I smelled my fingers to check how bad they wreaked of smoke out of habit (I am in close corners with my colleagues) and they smelled like NOTHING! Just fingers! Little reminders like this keep me going. This reminds me of the shame I felt when I was outside smoking and people walked by. Now, I can walk with my head held up high everywhere I go without feeling insecure and/or ashamed. 

I even grabbed a diet coke for lunch (I haven't had soda in a long time) as a reward. No, it's not ideal to replace an old bad habit with a new one, but during these first few weeks I plan on rewarding myself with something small every once in a while to replace the cravings. Soda isn't healthy but if a soda, chocolate, bag of cheetos, etc. helps me not to smoke, it's worth it. Remember to pay attention to these small victories and treat yourself!

Tried many times before and yes I do want to quit. When I kept hacking and I really mean hacking. Not to give TMI but when you're 35 yrs old and coughing up mucus that is tinged in yellow and you don't stop, it gives you a sense that something isn't normal. I am not coughing now except after exercise, it's not a worrisome problem.

I have been looking around many posts and I am seeing many many posts that says OH YOU HAVE TO WANT TO QUIT FOR IT TO STICK!!!!

Well I want to quit I really want to quit.  If I didn't I wouldn't still be trying but do not count that on EVERY situation because we know situations change.

I imagine those people who say that, which I am not angry about but it is annoying, are not mentally ill? Such as bipolar, schizophrenic, depression.  I am bipolar or as my doctor says bipolar I believe type 1 the non violent type that swings mostly towards depression with anxiety. 

I have tried chantix, I just tried chantix about 2 months ago. My doctor said since I have been stable for a while it shouldn't be a problem. After a week of taking it I noticed even on my medication I became very very irritable. It wasn't due to any particular situation, I would feel irritable all the time and become angry over anything! Once I quit the chantix on my own, it went away so you can not say it was just withdrawl when it only happend on the medication and once I got off it went away. I went back to cigarettes. I did tell my doctor what happened though and she appreciated that I am intuned to my moods and she agrees it was best to stop.

I don't have many depressive episodes anymore thanks to my medications but as anyone with bipolar can tell you the medications won't help every single time. Occasionally I'll have it.  This was years ago but I quit.  I hadn't been suicidal since I was a teenager and after 2 weeks of quitting I was in such a deep depression I thought about suicide. I said quitting is not worth suicide so I went back to smoking and my depression eased up.

You want to call these excuses go ahead, I respect that. I also respect there are some people here who have difference of opinion. I am giving this another try and I'm willing to ALMOST do anything. What I am NOT willing to do is think about suicide, get so angry I commit violence, or relapse on bipolar disorder.  Nobody with any sense of empathy would say hey ya killed yourself but at least your quit or hey you went to prison but at least ya quit would they?

Just wished people showed empathy instead of saying it's just excuses when they don't know the full extent.  So 24 hours are up and today I spent the full day on my feet. I got a lot done but my muscles were very sore. I've been working out harder since yesterday too.",2

\- The smoke-free app helped me be accountable to myself and motivate me

I can go in smokey bars no problem. Have been able to for 5+ years. I have friends who smoke and they have to plan around having a smoke. I remember that. Life is so much easier when you're not constantly looking for the next smoke break, worried about a long flight, having to make sure you have enough smokes for the night, smelling like shit, etc.

I wish you all the best. I'm here to hopefully help someone, because so many of us who have broken free never look back. I remember how hard it was, but I'm also here to report that it's worth doing.

That‚Äôs just not how it works(generally speaking) This knowledge has helped me overcome my cravings and I am hoping that it may help others as well.

I will post a link to a scientific journal about this subject for anyone who is interested at the bottom.

This psychological phenomenon or theory if you will, elaborates on the concept of thought suppression.  Often times when people are trying to suppress a thought, craving, compulsion, they will experience these more frequently and the intensity in which they experience them will increase as well.  When you tell yourself to not think about smoking, you are telling your subconscious to look for triggers and things that are related to smoking in an attempt to avoid the thoughts or urges from entering your conscious mind.  This has the opposite effect, in doing so you are going to be reminded of smoking more frequently and generally with a greater intensity.  You will experience cravings, you will want to give up.  Accept these thoughts, give them the attention and respect they deserve but do not allow them to take over.  This is essentially the practice of mindfulness.  You can not stop cravings from happening, accept them as cravings, and move on.  You are not a slave to these cravings, best of luck everyone.

I've tried to quit for so many times and I'd always fail after the first 3 days, but I'd keep lurking around here, smiling every time I'd see someone else reaching another milestone! <3

What helped me the most was being able to relate to others and realize that this has to be bad before it gets better and IT IS ! I'd search for some story or a symptom every time and day when I'd get a craving and I will continue to do so.

in other words, I am feeling great about this, but I think I am getting a little depressed and while I was talking with a friend, they recommended that I should record/journal my feelings in order to have clear facts about my progress and I took it to the next level and I've created a [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/smokecloudisover/) page lol (hoping that this will motivate me to stay quit and also force me to improve my english skills)

**tldr**: I created an instagram account where I will update on my journey. if you also have an acc where you share your health journey, share it in the comments, I'd happily follow you, I usually find them very motivating

Cheers. Good luck on your journey and stay strong! I hope we will all stay on the smoke-free road :)

2021-06-19 16:57:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/o3pofg/personal_and_definitive_10pt_list_to_help_you_quit/,Personal and definitive 10-pt list to help you quit,"1. Don't quit smoking for the benefits. Quit smoking because it is a decision you want to take. The benefits will follow. Love and respect for yourself are your motivations. And love is an aggregate of actions.

2. Reprogram your brain through mindful observation of yourself and your habit. Realise every time you smoke is not because you want to, but because nicotine tricks you into thinking you need to. The benefits you assign to smoking do not exist. Your brain is gaslighting you. You don't want to smoke. You never wanted to smoke. You will never want to smoke again.

3. Take note of the fear you feel when you're about to run out; the mental accounting to afford the next pack; the anxiety when you're somewhere you can't smoke, when you're worried about your smell; how hard it is to breathe in, how much you cough. Imagine all the freedom and pleasures that you cannot experience anymore due to your smoking. Realise how often you put off doing something important, challenging, scary, or demanding your concentration by lighting up. Dare to believe that you will be more courageous to face every day life when you quit. Because you will be. 

4. Sit with your feelings of shame, fear, anticipation, anxiety, curiosity, remorse, regret, unease, anger and frustration. Accept that they are all telling you that you need to quit. All are impermanent. All will turn to pride and confidence.

5. Set a date. Or don't. Use patches and gum. Or don't. Quit cold turkey. Or don't. But decide to quit. A decision is taken once, and reinforced with every passing thought. What matters is your conscious decision. No tactic is dirty when it comes to eradicating the nicotine enemy from your subconscious and your bloodstream. (so long as you respect your body and don't replace a destructive habit with another)

6. Allen Carr's EasyWay is one massively helpful tactic. The SmokeFree app (or any other) is too. So is isolating yourself away from triggers and stressor events for a while. And sleeping. Taking 1, 2, 3, 10 showers a day helps. Walks, drawings, videos, movies, changing scenery, mindfulness meditation, sitting on your hands, reading this sub, and articles about health benefits as well. Make believe cigarettes help with the movement habit. Cut a straw and slip a filter into it, chew on a round piece of wood and toothpicks, roots or branches, eat sunflower seeds, destroy a pen. Consult your doctor for short-term medication tactics to help you through the physical withdrawals; sleeping aids are helpful. So is knowledge, about cessation and health and what you're going through. It is power. 

7. It takes 72 hours for nicotine to leave your body. It takes 6 months for your brain's neurotransmitter receptors to stop expecting nicotine. You will feel like hell, and then you will feel miles better; and then you will feel like hell again, and then you will feel the best you have felt since you were a child. But you will be free from the moment you extinguish your last cancer stick.

8. Acknowledge your cravings. Don't wait for them to pass. Act and talk to yourself with care and love. Remind yourself how hard you want to quit smoking. Sit with every challenging emotion and reaffirm your decision. Use mantras. ""My brain and body are accustomed to the poison, and it is the poison that is asking for more of itself; not my body that is asking for it. It is hard to resist, but I will never smoke again."" Every ounce of difficulty from a craving is a testament to your body and your mind healing; not an ordeal to go through. 

9. Celebrate yourself with every passing moment. Congratulate yourself for daring to be tricked into feeling miserable by nicotine and for accepting temporary suffering in exchange for life-long freedom. You are brave. You are sticking it to the man, to self-pity, to fear, to tobacco companies and to your own false beliefs. You are showing yourself the compassion you deserve. 

10. You are worth it. You are enough. And you have it in you. Take your life into your own hands and be forgiving and loving of yourself and your hardships. The only way is through. The only moment is now. You deserve to love yourself actively, unconditionally. Good luck. ‚ù§",75

Once I was out of the ER from ketoacidosis though I actually started smoking more. I've gone from a pack a day to almost two while wearing a 21 MG patch. 

The patch literally does nothing for me. Gums, lozenges so on do not help at all. 

I'm due to see a new primary care doctor Monday and was considering asking about the nicotrol inhaler because I believe my insurance covers it whereas I don't think it covers other prescription based aids like Chantix.

They were all smoking shish pipes in one room. I would normally join them, but I stayed strong and didn't really feel an urge, as such. I did think it would be nice to join in. But quickly that thought slipped away. I mostly pity people who still smoke. I don;'t mean that in a bad way. I genuinely feel bad for them, because I know how deep the bonds of slavery dig into one's soul. The all-encompassing addiction that pretends to be a choice. The great pretender...

I know I'm on the right path. I feel freer, have more money, less shame. I want more of this. I will try not to become complacent, because at this point it very much feels like it's in my past. 

I noticed that my tolerance for smoke has gone done a lot and felt pretty bad afterwards (sore through, suffocating slightly). I really hope they quit.

Yesterday I gave away my copy of the Easyway to Quit Smoking - left it on a bench with a note. Hopefully you out there who picked it up are making your way through it.

I understand that this is a mechanism that can be made stronger (just like muscle fitness) through iteration. But I also know that our bodies adapt to what's exactly being experienced so I started wondering if there are any other exercises than straightforwardly trying to not smoke.

The reason I'm asking this is that I've observed my brain learning to lose/fail at things, somewhat of a learned \~\~helplessness\~\~ defeatedness. And I've started smoking cigarettes and weed almost at the same time 15 years ago and I know that weed weakens this mechanism that allows you to control your impulses. 

I'm sick of myself smoking stuff, slowly killing and torturing my body but don't even see a shred of power to let it go. 

I've been studying neuroscience and endocrinology for the last two years to get more control of myself. It worked on getting myself out of depression but I'm not so confident about this chemical and behavioral chain.

I want to look better

I want to smell good

I want to save money

I quit a month earlier.,"I have been smoking ever since the start of University, back in 2011. Picked up the filthy habit as a way of dealing with the stress. I have stopped mid 2014 but quickly fell back into it after working as a nurse. It didn't help that other nurses I worked with were heavy smokers. 

Started vaping with nicotine in 2016 as a means of cessation, but found myself vaping non stop. Vaping while indoors at home, on the drive to work and was taking smoking breaks a lot more frequently. During this time, I would also smoke cigarettes socially whenever my friends and I go bar hopping.

Mid May, my brother brother wanted me to promise him that as soon as his child is born, that I would stop smoking for good. The last thing I want is for my niece is to grow up with a smoker in the family and, possibly, pick up the habit from me. 

It's been one month since I had a cigarette, vape or anything nicotine/smoking related and went cold turkey. The first week was a real struggle. I felt sluggish, irritable, short of breathe and like I'm constantly on the edge of losing my temper. During this time, while I'm on the computer, I notice myself reaching the stop on my desk where my vape is, only to realize that I threw it out a week ago. Took a while to stop reaching for my vape that is no longer there. At this point, I was desperate for the smell burning tobacco where I would stand close to work colleagues during their smoke breaks. This didn't last long as this would've been as bad as smoking to begin with.

2-3 weeks into quitting, I feel my appetite coming back and have found myself being able to work out longer. The temptation is still there, but the extra exercise helps in keeping my mind off cravings.

A month in, I feel like I passed the really hard part. I do have the occasional cravings for a cigarette but it has gotten a lot easier just to say, ""no"". Some days, the cravings are more intense than others because of work, but I'm lucky to have supportive friends and family.",4

I have so many reasons to quit. I am healthy otherwise; workout, take my medication, eat well for the most part. This is the last thing to kick.

I've incrementally  stopped drinking, then stopped the ganja, quit caffeine, and stopped sugar and any processed foods all together. I stopped smoking cigarettes almost 3 months now, but continued to vape. This past week, I put down the vape and its been a week that I haven't had any nicotine. I can say that I feel so good but of course the cravings come and go.

My question to those who have quit nicotine successfully, how long does the increased appetite last? I've been eating extra amounts of fruit the past week and have needed to offset that by working out  longer and harder. Is the increased appetite something that I need to overcome naturally with time, or is this going to be a battle like everything else when it comes to habits?

I didn't have any issues with eating before stopping nicotine, I just find myself consuming way more now than before.

When do I smoke? Is it an escape from social situations? Are you just being self destructive? Find out why you smoke but look beyond the nicotine addiction and deeper into yourself.

Heres a list I‚Äôve been writing about some of the unusual things that i observed or experienced during my main quit phase:

1) Nobody noticed when i quit which was odd and a bit disappointing . People made a point to judge and shame me when i did but literally never noticed when i stopped.

2) The cough was the first thing to go and it was gone after a week. 

3) Withdrawal for me wasn‚Äôt cranky or fidgety. It was a bizarre experience where any time that i would usually light up (for example leaving the house to go to work) i would have these electric micro headaches. 

4) Things i hated to eat suddenly tasted amazing. Coriander and cracked pepper became the most amazing things on the planet and the first year of quitting became a food adventure. I became addicted to buffalo wings sauce.

5) I kept forgetting to brush my teeth because my mouth and fingers stopped smelling so bad. It got so bad i had to set alarms to remind me to brush before bed.

6) Smoking dreams. I still get them 5 years later. They don‚Äôt make me want to start up again but its so bizarrely familiar when it happens, its like i never stopped.

7) Not getting bronchitis every cold and flu season is fabulous. Being unwell is infinitely more bearable now and doesn‚Äôt knock me out for weeks like it used to.

8) People who i did inform of my quit mission were more often than not pessimistic and were certain i would fail. This made it hard to celebrate the milestones.

9) Some of my biggest quit supporters were smokers and vapers.

There wasn‚Äôt any quick fix for me. I took the experimental route of vaping as a transition. I vaped 6mg as a replacement to 25 cigarettes a day. I eventually dropped down to 3mg within two months then diluted the 3mg with non nicotine a further 3 months later.

At a guess i would say my urge to go outside and smoke or vape ended within a month of ceasing any nicotine via vape. Its at that point that i believe i was quit and no longer at risk of relapse.

Everyone has a different method and experience but i just wanted to share some of the interesting things I experienced which were not in any quit websites or pamphlets :) 

My only advice is if quitting didn‚Äôt work one way, try another way next time. I think it took 6 years of thinking about trying to quit and failing with patches and gum for this to work for me. Keep trying!",181

Since the last relapse in the last weekend, I find myself back to smoking and also beating myself emotionally for doing it. In the coming weekend Im leaving for vacation (1 week) and Im currently struggling with the decision to quit now before the vacation or to wait until I come back. 

My concern is that I will ruin my vacation with a constant thinking about smoking, especially since I will go in vacation with my girlfriend (non-smoker) but also a couple of smokers. On the other hand, I know that for each day I continue to smoke, it will get harder to quit when I come back (especially since I will have a bad mood after the long awaited vacation is now over) and not to mention that I already have a bad mood when I smoke due to disappointment. 

I feel myself TRAPPED between bad mood for smoking and bad mood of withdrawal, and the decission to quit now or after vacation. What is your opinion on this? Did you have similar experiences? Any advice is appreciated!!",3

Sorry if I'm all over the place, I kind of need to get this out. I hope that's fine for this sub. any advice would be appreciated. 

I have a bit of a weird history with smoking. 

With 16, my first boyfriend introduced me to cigarettes. Always being the ""good kid"" from a good home, I took a nosedive into a somewhat rebellious phase. I never like the taste of it, but i liked to rebel a bit and participated in his idea of fun - occasional smoking, weed, alcohol. Nothing too wild, just trying shit out. 

Well, after a while he left me. I did not take that well. My undiagnosed mental health issues were starting to act up at that point, and I found cigarettes as a nice distraction. But, again, I'm from a ""good home"" - no one smokes, and they wouldn't appreciate me smoking at ALL. I didn't even know where to find a lighter, matches had to do for the start. 

So, my ritual was to smoke exactly one cigarette a day behind a small patch of trees in school breaks (which wasn't necessary since with 16 i just got into a vocational college (germany, ""Berufskolleg"") where every student was treated as a young adult, but i was still anxoius about it). Anything more would make me feel very sick. At some point, i got introduced to the smoker-circle of my class and from there, i worked my way up to six a day, at max. So, not exactly the hardest chainsmoker. Mind you, i almost never smoked at home. I had my strict schedule of exclusively smoking in that city. The few times i did smoke at home, i was way too anxious of being caught. It's a miracle my parents didn't know, because if they did, hell would've broken loose above me. 

I kind of hoped that i wouldn't need the cigarettes anymore when I got out of that school (wasn't a fun time there and smoking was the only thing that gave me a bit of a break). Well, i was wrong... kinda. I went from a school smoker to a somewhat occasional smoker, since i had no real possibility to do it at home. When I got to know my now boyfriend, it got even rarer, since he absolutely does not like any sort of smoking. 

I started uni a few months later (i was 18 at that time), and thought hey, this is a fresh start, i wont smoke at all anymore. But soon, the stress and my mental health got the best of me again and in these phases i smoked occasionally again. Always at uni, since i lived with my boyfriend at that point.

I still live with him in a shared apartment, and with the whole covid thing going on, i have zero possibility to smoke. In the entire covid time i smoked maybe three times, at max. Last time was one year ago. So, technically, I'm smoke free. 

Except it doesn't feel like it. What kept me from smoking was ironically taking a pack everywhere I go. I'm in treatment for depression and a social phobia since i was 19 (im 22 now), which has helped me tremendously. I tried throwing all my cigarettes away for good, but it always ended the same way - with me getting cravings, walking past a kiosk daily, feeling pissed off that i cant be in controll of myself, being super anxious about having to talk to someone to get new ones, getting over myself and getting a pack again, feeling guilty and smoking one as to not waste them now that i finally got them. So, when I keep a pack at all times, i feel in control of my own actions, and have the possibility to choose last minute that i dont want to smoke. It shouldn't work, but it does for me. I hadn't touched them in so long that I bought a new pack a few months ago, out of concern that the old ones went bad or something. I still have all of these new ones. 

Aside from that, i have the worst cravings when im stressed. My mental health problems amplify that almost constantly. I tend to romanticise things in my head, and my past with smoking is no exception to that. Right now im having terrible cravings - but I couldn't even give in if i wanted to, since my boyfriend would be hurt by that. We've talked about this a lot and he wouldn't ever force me to do or not do something, but i don't want to hurt him. And it sucks. I feel like im not in control of my own actions, which is not helping at all. 

I feel like an imposter. I'm not a smoker - i dont even feel as if I ever really were, since i did it all so hidden, every time being super anxious of being caught. But I also don't feel like a non-smoker since I have constant cravings I can't give in to, even though I still take cigarettes with me every time i go out. I feel like neither and both at the same time. 

What sucks most is that I just... don't feel like im making these choices for myself. I really, really want to smoke. And i also really, really want to NOT want that, but i don't know how to get rid of this feeling. It just all feels like a big fucking mess I can't find a way out of, since im already doing what im supposed to, i just don't feel like it. Like I'm not even trying.

I don't know what to do. I don't even know where I'm going with this. I guess i am searching for a way to get rid of these constant cravings, despite being technically clean for a long time. Maybe I also want for someone to say ""its fine, go smoke, do things for yourself"". Of course no ones gonna say that, but its what i feel like. Or I want to find a way out of feeling like im not in control of my own actions - although thats probably a conversation i should have with my therapist. Again.

I just... wanted to share this with people who could have the ability to understand how I'm feeling. My boyfriend cannot understand it, he tries but he can't. My family still doesnt know i ever smoked. My friends can't say anything about that either. Smoking is looked down upon by nearly everyone I know. I don't know where to turn to find likeminded people, so i guess this is me trying to do that.",10

2021-06-15 12:48:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/o0itl5/quitting_quandary/,Quitting Quandary,"Hey all,

Just discovered this sub and wanted to see if anyone had any advice to relate to my situation.

I've been smoking for about 11 years, bar about 9 months in my mid 20s where I gave up to train for a marathon. I average about 15 a day though I've managed to reduce it to as low as 7 some days. 

I've been trying to quit for years, probably at least 50% of the time I've been smoking. I've tried going cold turkey, I've tried gradual reductions, I've tried vapes, I've tried gums, I've tried reading Allen Carr, ad infinitum. Nothing works. 

I've had minor success limiting the realms in which I smoke. Just at work, or just on my daily walks (x3) but it always seems to encroach on the rest of my life.

My main problem is that cigarettes have become releases at opposite ends of the spectrum. If I'm super stressed, I know I can't get through a day without cigarettes, but conversely, if I'm bored or chilled out, I enjoy having a cigarette with a cup of tea or something. 

As I mentioned, I gave up for 9 months in 2015 to train for a marathon (a charity event across 7 days that ended in a marathon actually) and I don't know how ibwas so disciplined then, both in training and quitting. I love running, I love the thought of racing against myself and improving my times and I know that smoking is a major barrier to hitting my peak. But when I did a run on Monday, I had a cigarette not half an hour afterwards. 

I'm just lost for ideas of how to approach quitting or motivating myself to do so anymore. One half of my brain wants nothing more than to be smoke free, knows I'll have health and money and rewards beyond what smoking can bring. But the other half still wins 9 out of 10 times. 

Any advice to tame that unruly half? Unusual methods I might not have tried? 

Thanks!",6

What are some personal experiences some of you have had with patches? I am worried that if I attempt the patches I won't know what to do with my hands and will want to reach for anything that satisfies the urge to smoke regardless of nicotine being involved. I just hope the patches will make a difference in controlling those cravings both chemically and physically.

I'm now six days into my new life as a non-smoker! I read the Allen Carr Easyway book, which finally gelled in my head after many readthroughs, and I have not missed smoking. I'm 43, and I had my first cigarette at 15.

My lungs feel better, my nose and throat feel better, and my heart feels better. My 9 year old was mentioning my smoking (outside, not inside, but she saw it). I'm so glad she won't see that anymore. 

I kept the '1 or 2 ciggies a day' rule for a long time, but the last day I smoked, I think it was three packs. I'm done paying $600/month to kill myself slowly. I smoked my way through a traumatic divorce  (separated a year ago) and restraining order event last June, but I realized, I'm just kept pushing my quit date into the future. Well, it's here, and in the past week, I've saved $123, and I don't sound like someone with emphysema. Crazy how quickly my croupy cough went away, but I'm never going back to that.

It gives your hands something to do, and once you are done, you get to smoke the cigarette you just rolled for yourself.

I am able to pull myself out of them much easier. My anxiety has also reduced dramatically. These results aren't solely because of the absence of nicotine as I have been doing a lot of other work on myself, but it's definitely a huge factor because I am no longer dependent on the drug to help regulate my emotions. Looking back, I can definitely see how nicotine numbed my emotional awareness and stunted my emotional growth.

Its been hard and I've had to take a good long look in the mirror and confront my demons. Nicotine helped suppress them and my anxieties and giving it up, I almost lost touch with reality a couple of times as they threatened to overwhelm me and I felt very depressed.  I realised I don't want to take a substance to make myself feel calm or to avoid having confront my problems anymore and live with myself, and as a result I've had several epitomes. I catch myself consciously doing things I've subconsciously been aware of... And I've had several 'hang on why the fuck am I thinking like that /doing that?? That's not helping! That's not productive or constructive and it ain't gonna help at all! ""

I feel stronger and I can hang out with smokers without wanting a cig. I feel calmer in myself and my mind isn't so up and down. By confronting my problems and worries I'm actually dealing with them and realising they don't eclipse everything. I'm not in emergency mode anymore and can actually enjoy time off.

Will continue to post here, as this forum is a lifeline. If you're thinking of stopping smoking, give it up and do your best. Use NRT if you want to but don't feel you're a lesser person because of that. If it's right for you, leave that crutch behind just like you left cigarettes.

Give it your all, break the hold on you, give up the crutch you don't need.

**How do I break a bad habit?** 

**What is a bad habit?**  

Let‚Äôs understand this with the simple human behavior that the things we love the most we try to stay with them and the things we hate the most we try to stay away from them. A habit is our love and temptation for something, which could be food, alcohol, smoking, gaming, and so on. Sometimes, it becomes a part of our lives that we are compelled by our brains to do it, even if we try to resist it.

So, when you are trying to resist, but you are compelled by your brain after doing that thing, if you feel angry or unhappy about it, you may simply call it a bad habit. You get into a vicious circle & keep trying to break that habit, the more you try to break it, the more compulsive it becomes to you.

You may continue to stay engaged in bad habits for a long time, and it continues to make you less confident. The repercussions are not just limits to making you less confident, but it also leaves a negative impact on your personality, and there are many more negative aspects to this. 

Bad habits make you susceptible to a variety of diseases. Sometimes your family life also gets disturbed by your bad habits. Your outlook on life becomes negative, and your efforts to achieve something are futile.

**How does a habit start?** 

Let‚Äôs understand this basic concept of how a habit is formed. The first time you drink, smoke, or play a game that makes you feel happy from the inside, or you may feel good about it. That creates a certain impact on your brain, and the urge comes to do it again. The next time the urge to do it will not be that compelling, but a continuous engagement in a bad habit puts you into a vicious circle.

I began smoking because ""a cigarette in my hand was like feeling like a man‚Äù and alcohol gave me a similar feeling. I used to smoke about two packets of cigarettes a day and about half a bottle of whiskey.

The intention behind drinking alcohol was to entertain or reward myself and to feel relaxed, but it quickly became a solid, bad habit for me.

I continued doing that for almost 15 years, but I always wanted to break the vicious circle. I searched the internet & found a few ideas like ""Stay Away from Temptations that Help Feed Your Addiction or Bad Habits.‚Äù. The problem is that if you try to stay away from it, it becomes more tempting and compelling to you.

**One day, I finally got a trick to quit my bad habits. The idea came to me in a simple way that if you start hating something, you will automatically get rid of it through the brain**, but it will still compel you to continue doing that. The habit was never formed in a day, and you also cannot get rid of it in a day. 

So I didn't quit smoking in a single day; it took continuous effort to break the vicious circle. Whenever I felt the urge to smoke, I would smoke, but instead of smoking the entire cigarette, I would take one or two puffs and then throw away the cigarette with hatred. Within a month‚Äôs time the habit came down to six cigarettes a day. In two months, the urge came down to one cigarette a day. Finally, two cigarettes a week and then one cigarette a week, and now there was no urge to smoke left.

Eventually, I was able to break the vicious circle. The urge for alcohol was also reduced during this period. I still drink about two to three pegs of 60 ml of alcohol twice a week, and it‚Äôs not compelling. I do it by choice now. Also, sometimes I don‚Äôt drink for 10 to 15 days. 

Break the vicious circle and start loving your life.",9

When I was smoking, just a week ago, I was more active and diligent in getting things done and was very motivated to try new hobbies and things like that.

Now I feel I'm glued to my phone more than usual, and kinda just drifting through my days off which I hate. I'm wasting time doing nothing just browsing YouTube. I think my brain is craving that quick fix dopamine flood.

Hm, I suppose now is the time for discipline.

2021-06-12 19:37:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/nyjq6r/at_9_months_past_the_best_decision_i_ever_made/,"at 9 months past the best decision I ever made, just wanted to share some encouragement to the subreddit :)","Hi all! If you're here, you should be proud of yourself. If you check this subreddit on a regular basis and you are getting inspiration from the posts & comments here, you're on the right track to accomplishing what most of us at one point or another probably thought we'd never be 'ready' to quit, or 'strong enough' to quit, etc. I'm gonna do the typical 'addicts anonymous' thing, here: hi my name is sparafucilex and I used to really fucking love nicotine. :P

I first started smoking when I got my first job as a teenager -- 3 out of 4 people working there were smokers and it seemed like a good idea at the time. Plus a few of my close relatives smoked. I wasn't ever around them when they were smoking; at that age, just knowing that they *did* smoke was enough, I think. 'Cigarette warnings' have been a pop culture/TV/comedy staple for so long that I just ended up seeing it as a harmless clich√© that was only true for *some* people, which is what Big Tobacco always hoped for us to think. I had a lot of emotional childhood baggage and was already an anxious sort and smoking was the perfect social prop for me. I felt like I 'belonged' somewhere -- 15 minute breaks at work were stress-free bonding experiences for me and my Marlboros. And then I belonged there for 25 years, give or take. I stopped working due to disability years ago but kept on buying smokes, at least a pack a day.

I started 'trying to quit' a long time ago. I remember getting so mad at myself for buying another pack of cigarettes that I would smoke maybe 5 cigarettes from a pack and then throw the rest of the pack out in the trash. Which was great, except at the end of the day, usually in the middle of the fucking night, when I'd be digging through the kitchen trash can trying to find a stick that hadn't gotten wet or crumpled. I didn't care because I thought I could not possibly cope with the 'nic fits'. I wish I could say that was a one-time thing. Sure. It was. If you're going by a single month.

I lost a good relationship years ago, partially due to smoking, just like what happened to Allen Carr in a chapter of his famous book. I was sneaking smokes behind my then-fiancee's back, chain-smoking on long solo drives, and constantly lying about it. If I didn't already hate myself for being chained to a daily pack of smokes, I *really* despised myself after that mess.

I have a lot of health problems and developed several bad sinus infections and I still smoked. My mother died of lung cancer unrelated to smoking and for 10+ years afterwards, I still smoked.

~9 months ago, I had my last cigarette. I never thought I'd be able to do it, but I did, and I feel like I've, quite honestly, gotten my life back. I can breathe, I don't have the same bad issues with blood circulation that I used to, I'm waaaay less anxious, and I'm not as stressed about being able to afford stuff because cigarettes aren't an expense for me anymore. And I have so much more energy and time to spend on my life, instead of blowing it on obsessing about my next smoke.

Just wanted to let you know, again... if you're here and reading these stories and comments... you are the right path. You made the decision to, at the very least, check out this support subreddit. Stick with it. Be serious about it and be commited to your health and you can get rid of this monkey on your back and give the middle finger to Big Tobacco it deserves.

It's not impossible. At first it feels like the worst thing, but think of all the times you had to work on a project that took weeks or months to accomplish. To paraphrase someone famous, nothing that's worth anything happens without a proportional effort. and it's *so* fuckin' worth the effort to not be a smoker.

have a great weekend :) ‚ô•",73

And I actually do not seem to suffer a lot of the physical withdrawal symptoms of smoking, at least to the point that I feel awful. It is more like a coping mechanism for my restlessness.

2021-06-11 17:10:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/nxqc35/my_tribute_and_how_it_helped/,My tribute and how it helped,"I was an avid smoker for 8 years since I was 15 years old, now 23 I am officially 5 months nicotine free and would love to share how I did it with this wonderful  community.

I have transitioned from 10 sticks a day to vaping, literally thinking about having a cigarette break every opportunity I get, to vaping everywhere and now I am free from the nicotine monster's grasp. 

Let me share two most important ways of how I did it. 

Firstly I tribute it to my late grandmother(non smoker 68) who has brought me up, she passed November 2020 due to a species of lung cancer situated around her ovaries(lungs were clean) and she frequently reminded me that e ciggs are equally detrimental or worse than ciggs.

This tribute is crucial, having a greater purpose to quitting is one of the reminders and support that I established for myself, I believe we are powerful when we dedicate something to somebody that we love. 

The second thing that helped me out was giving a closure to my old friend Marlboro by saying my farewells and appreciations to my last pack of cigarettes, it was as if I was breaking up with them! haha! 

I thanked them for being there throughout my ups and downs, they were there for me throughout the important parts of my life. Just acknowledging the fact that they were there helped me out. 
It may sound silly or absurd but give this a try to whoever in this community that are still trying. 

The first few weeks will be tough, I experienced shivers and numbing of my fingers with weight gain but we must remind ourselves, since we are already putting ourself through this phase of nicotine withdrawal, once is enough!

a few more tips that I wanna include is 
1) In order to break a habit, replace it with another. 
(started gymming and cycling was mine) 

2) Read Allen Carr's how to quit smoking book

3)Try using vicks inhaler and have a few boxes of sweets nearby. 

4)Remove anything in your sight that reminds you of smoking 

5) Do not think about how long you can be a non smoker, the moment we stopped smoking we are already a non smoker! go through it day by day. 

6) Have the courage to tell friends that you quit! 
stand by our resolve and stand tall. True friends will be proud and might even join us in our journey.

I miss my grandmother and I wish I can tell her that I have quit smoking, I hope she's in a better place.

Thank you for reading and let's keep fighting fighters!!!",3

2021-06-11 15:49:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/nxojit/somehow_i_got_so_drunk_that_i_quit_smoking_let_me/,Somehow I got so drunk that I quit smoking. Let me explain.,"Holy shit this wound up longer than I thought. TLDR at the end. 

Let me start by saying that I do not condone abusing one addictive substance to attempt to quit another. I'm not touting this as any kind of quitting method, I'm simply telling my story of how I somehow got lucky and managed to quit in an entirely unintended way. 

I don't consider myself much of a drinker but I can definitely drink given the right circumstances. Every now and then I might order a beer with my meal when out to eat or have a few drinks at the bar when an old friend come to town. This constitutes nearly all of my drinking. A few here and there and harldy ever multiple days in a row. I have never felt any sort of addiction to alcohol and I feel as though I know my limits and how to handle myself responsiby. 

Now that I'm in my 30s, a good old fashioned house party seems like a relic of the past. In my early to mid 20s I absolutely loved it. Loud music and rediculous drinking games late into the night, drinking way too much and eventually sleeping on the floor of a buddy's kitchen or something. The good ol days. 

It had been a while since I'd attended anything like that but over the weekend, my younger cousin  invited my wife and I to a party she was hosting at her new apartment. At first I felt like such an old man there as the average age was about 22, but slowly throughout the night, my younger self started to emerge. I was having such a blast playing every drinking game they could come up with and even teaching an old game or 2 to these 'kids'. 

I drank, and I drank, and I drank even more. Never did it occur to me just HOW MUCH I was drinking. I was simply enjoying myself all night. Never felt sick or anything. My lovely (and sober) wife drove us home, laughed at me as I continuously failed to unlock our front door, and guided my stumbling ass to bed. Life was good. 

The next morning, I. WANTED. TO. DIE. 

HOLY. SHIT. 

I have never been so hungover in my life. Nothing even put a dent in it. No amount of water, juice, vitamins, Tylenol, you name it, made me feel better. 

Ah-ha, I thought. I was so preoccupied at the party that I actually went the whole night without a smoke. That never happens. I typically smoke every couple hours or so, so clearly this was contributing to how bad I felt. Withdrawal was definitely setting in. I absolutely needed a smoke to feel better. Nothing seemed more certain. 

I grabbed my smokes, headed outside, lit up, took a few quick puffs and to my absolute shock... nearly threw up. It was so bad and made me feel even worse. I put it out right then and there. 

I continued to feel like death the entire day and later in the evening attempted a smoke for the second time. Same result. Repulsive. So I went to sleep. 

The next morning I felt better but still not 100%. I was running a little late to work and didn't grab my smokes on the way out the door. My day was pretty busy and somehow I just never felt the need for a smoke until I finally got home. I was just about to have a smoke when I completely stopped and realized, 'holy shit, I really haven't smoked in nearly 3 WHOLE DAYS. That had not happened in literally a few years. And I was feeling... ok. 

I stared at my smoke for another minute, thinking about everything that had taken place over the last few days. I definitely had a craving. It wasn't incredibly strong, but it was there. 

And I just said ""nah, I want it but I don't need it.""

And I put it down, made some dinner and called it a night. 

I'm now on day 6 and while the cravings still pop up, I feel like I got some of the worst ones out of the way in the first 2 days because I was literally too hungover to smoke without throwing up. 

A few years ago I quit for a few months but it didn't last. I don't know, this feels different. My most recent memories of smoking, or i guess  attempting to smoke, are really negative experiences and I think that's helping brush off the cravings. 

TLDR: Drank way too much at a party, had a hangover from hell that lasted a day and a half, attempting to smoke made it worse. By the time I felt better, I'd been smoke free for 3 days so decided 'fuckit' and quit for good, hopefully. 

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. 

Cheers.",23

But I've noticed in the last few weeks that my lung function seems to be worsening and I'm coughing a lot, particularly at night and early in the morning. I'm getting that smoker's cough again--the one that happens when you breathe in too deeply and it kinda tickles the back of your throat then turns into a big, uncontrollable cough, sometimes with a little phlegm. 

Anyway, it's concerning. I'm 99% sure I don't have Covid as I've been vaccinated and haven't been in contact with anyone who has Covid.

Has anyone else experienced this? Any insights?

This past Sunday, I checked myself into an urgent care as I wasn't feeling well. My BP was 80/60 and my pulse ox saturation was 81%.

June 6th, 2021 at 9:38am was the last time I smoked a cigarette.  It's now been 6 days since, and I'll never touch one ever again.  I am finally at home out of the hospital after stopping a 26 year pack a day habit.  I can barely breathe on my own.  I'm now hooked up to an oxygen machine for how long I don't know.   It is tremendously difficult to even accomplish the smallest of tasks.  I'm on steroids, breathing treatments, inhalers... just about anything to help me with my plight of fighting to live again.  I've never been so scared as I have been this past week.  

To those of you on the fence about quitting or your struggles with quitting are mightier:  Don't wait until you are no longer able to breathe.  Having your air supply taken from you can really screw you up bad, not to mention flat out kill you.

Sure, I'm cheating the system with a nicotine patch for the time being.  But I could care less if I'm viewed as still being hooked to nicotine.  The point is I'm no longer smoking.  The nicotine cessation will come in time gradually.  I've quit before, but have always come back to smoking.  This time I know without a doubt is different.  This time I'll never pick one up again, ever.  Today I choose to fight for my life, not prepare for my death.  Good luck to you all, kind strangers, on your journey to be smoke free.",187

It truly did. So I didn't smoke again. 
8 years later I went on a date with a girl who was smoker who insisted me to smoke to give her company and I was naive enough to think that I won't relapse with just one cigarette. I was so wrong.
With the pandamic caused lockdown, my relationship with a girl who smokes, started the phase of me chain smoking.
I have realised that smoking makes me lethargic. I have stopped cycling, running, sports activities and cooking.
My life was controlled by cigarettes. I used to open my refrigerator make some sugary drink, eat something so that I can smoke more. 
I was feeling depressed, unhealthy and disgusted with myself. 
I tried to quit multiple times, but seeing my girlfriend smoke, I couldn't resist. She also needs help quitting but she ia not ready to any efforts as yet and doesn't want to quit cold turkey. 

Last week I decided to end my relationship and yesterday I have stopped smoking. I already feel better. I feel like doing something all the time rather than sitting in front of screen n smoking.
I hope I can continue and stay away from cigarettes and focus on my mental and physical health.

I knew I was being a beta f*ckboy by so easily giving into the offer to smoke. I felt like a prostitute, selling myself for a cigarette and conversation instead of being stronger to just say no thanks and chat with him anyway...

I start buzzing hard immediately and was stuttering and barely getting my words out, feeling the stimulating effect of the cigarette. I felt like an idiot.

I get back inside and immediately I'm edgy, biting my nails (which had stopped since I quit), restless... 

I'm glad I didn't like it, it was mentol, but I'm angry with myself that I'll so easily give in to make connections with people as if I'm not good enough without smoking or whatever is going on. People pleasing bullsh*t.

I only smoked one, but now I'm back on the quit train with some new perspectives.

Don't sell yourself short for other people. Honestly, if you're trying to quit and you give in anyway they'll see you're weak despite getting instant gratification of the interaction. They lose respect for you and you lose it for yourself. Lose-lose situation.

I had a major potential for slipping up/temptation this past weekend, when my friend who smokes heavily visited. I sat with them when they smoked but I did not feel tempted. I was a little surprised I didn't feel tempted, as I was worried about that leading up to their visit. Especially because we have spent many a good time bonding over cigarettes late at night.

Since I've quit, I noticed that I don't wake up feeling congested...it's a little scary to think about it, but I realize in hindsight how much I would wake up from having dreams where I was being crushed under a weight on my chest, only to realize it was my airways being clogged by thick mucus. I sometimes woke up wheezing and coughing. Now I can sleep on my back or my side without any trouble. I've been going to the gym and doing cardio for 25-30 minutes at a time, and it feels great.

I promise not to become ""that guy"" about smokers, as I understand and have been in their shoes, but I had a revelation seeing my friend. I noticed my friend coughs and wheezes pretty badly when they laugh (that smoker's chest rattle and raspy noise), they have tooth problems and have developed sleep apnea. I also noticed the smell on my friend's clothes and hair more; it's worse than I ever thought it was when I smoked, so I guess it's a mix of my sense of smell coming back plus the fact that they smoke heavier than I did. I'm sure I smelled pretty bad to nonsmokers when I was smoking, no matter how much I thought I hid it. I love and care for my friend dearly, so I hope one day they will quit, too.

The next step for me, starting soon, will be to cut out some of the extraneous processed foods and alcohol in my diet. I went a little too hard on a daily beer or wine during the pandemic and I'm ready to try and focus on being overall more healthy.

Good luck to you all, and I hope I can keep up my quit!",4

I dont want to feel like shit anymore. Out of breath. High blood pressure. Stinky breath... missing moments with loved ones to go have a fucking cigg. And the fact that MILLIONS of butches are out there on planet earth cause of me...makes me feel so ashamed. 
Ive got my 21mg patch on! It makes me dizzy but I dont want a cigarette! 

I just had to tell someone other than my partner.

The ultimate test situation: I didnt even realize I was putting myself in the worst quitting smoking situation until I was in it.... lol. I signed up to take 8 children to the zoo with a friend of mine. 8 kids under 10 and 2 adults in the heat! What was I thinking?!?! So many triggers yesterday and I made it through! 

Triggers I beat: I had a double shot latte, a beer, my friend was smoking and we used to be smoke break partners, stress and busyness of packing for and loading up 8 small kids for a hot and frugal zoo day (lunches, drinks, etc) , coaching kids through arguments & behavioral redirection, driving in traffic, just plain exhaustion and the need for a break for a minute.

Im feeling like if I could get through THAT I will really be able to do this for real! I do need to find a way to still take breaks in the day that won't trigger a craving. Im burning myself out staying busy all day long.",3

For a refresher, [nicotine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#:~:text=Nicotine%20is%20a%20chiral%20alkaloid,cessation%20to%20relieve%20withdrawal%20symptoms.) is a toxic component found in cigarettes. It is what makes cigarettes addictive. It can also be present on some electronic cigarettes and vapes.

Now that people have access to more information, we are becoming more aware of how dangerous this chemical is. Some employers are even asking job applicants to pass a nicotine test for employment, especially in health care organizations. They want employees to be good role models for wellness and good well-being.

## How long does it stay in your body?

Most of the nicotine you ingest has a half-life of about two hours. When absorbed by the body, nicotine is broken down into different substances. These substances are cotinine, anabasine, nornicotine, and many more. Nicotine will disappear from your bloodstream in 3 days after you stop smoking. Cotinine takes a bit more time and will be detectable for up to 10 days. Both nicotine and cotinine are undetectable in urine in 3 to 4 days.

## Types of Tests for Nicotine Detection

There are many kinds of tests for detecting nicotine. And while nicotine is absorbed fast, these tests actually scan for other substances that nicotine is broken down into.

### Saliva Test

This is the most common test for nicotine. This is also the most sensitive way of detecting cotinine.

Many laboratories and insurance companies make use of this test as it is cost-effective. It can detect cotinine for up to 4 days. The process is easy with the use of a third-party swabbing kit.

### Blood Test

A blood test is one of the most accurate testing methods for detecting nicotine and cotinine. The downside? It's the most expensive testing method. However, a blood test makes it possible to identify the level of nicotine metabolite in your blood serum. On average, nicotine is present in the blood for only 48 hours, but cotinine can stay up to ten days.

### Urine Test

Urine contains higher levels of cotinine compared to blood or saliva. It only varies depending on how frequently you use nicotine. Nicotine can be detected in urine for three to four days.

### Hair Test

This method is reliable but can also be the most difficult process for detecting cotinine. There are times that results are unclear and required for another test. It can also be expensive at times. With this test, nicotine can be detected for up to90 days after you stop using tobacco.

## What Factors Affect How Long Nicotine Stays in Your Body

### Age

Age affects human metabolism. As people get older, metabolism slows down. This means that your body takes more time to metabolize your nicotine intake so it stays in your body longer.

### Diet and Lifestyle

Food intake affects the metabolism of your body. Whatever you eat is used in your body's metabolism. If you eat unhealthy and oily foods, your metabolism slows down. The same goes for persons who have an inactive lifestyle.

### Frequency of Nicotine Intake

This is the most significant determinant of how long nicotine stays in your system. The more you use nicotine products, the higher concentration of toxins you get.

### Medication

Some medications affect how your body metabolizes nicotine. Antibiotics can speed up nicotine metabolism. On the other hand, antifungals like ketoconazole can slow down your nicotine metabolism.

### Tips to Rid Your Body of Nicotine

Is it possible to flush out nicotine from your body? Not exactly. But you can help your body hasten the process. Here are some things you can do.

&#x200B;

* Avoid nicotine products at all costs (obviously).
* Drink a lot of water. Water can help you flush out byproducts from your kidneys and liver.
* Be more active. Exercises to increase your body‚Äôs metabolism.
* Eat a healthy diet that is rich in antioxidants. It can help your body repair itself.

Overall, it is not too late to get away from nicotine. You may struggle at the beginning but it will all be worth it in the end. There are alternative solutions that can help you overcome nicotine dependence. Nicotine-free vapes are now available. It's not too late to enjoy a nicotine-free life. You‚Äôll live longer too.

The first time I quit cigs, it was cold turkey, and I was good after about week or two. But stress overtook me after a couple of years, and I was back to smoking. I eventually switched to vaping, since nicotine patches and gum make me sick.

I had been vaping for over a year, and I again quit nicotine (both cigs and vape) cold turkey last month, April 10th. Since then, I‚Äôve had cravings, every day, for a month. Some more intense than others. I know every body is different, but I think since I was vaping more than smoking cigs (it‚Äôs incredibly easy to do, though I tried various ways to cut down and taper off), it‚Äôll be longer for the cravings to leave me.

And because of that, I limited how many packs I bought a week. Usually only 2 and would try to buy packs out in the suburbs for $8 a pack or go to the stores selling smokes from Missouri for $10 a pack. 

The problem was, that whenever I didn't have my own cigarettes, I'd be on the hunt and search for someone smoking outside and see if they could sell me a smoke for a dollar or look for a guy selling loose newports for 75 cents a stick. Sure, I wasn't smoking a pack a day but I felt like I made a habit out of bumming. Some people wouldn't mind and tell me to keep my dollar and just give me one or sell it to me. Some people would get pissed if I asked them. Made me feel like a scumbag for doing something nearly every smoker would do. Even when I'd buy smokes off strangers, it'd still add up and I kept doing it because I knew someone would sell me one. 

Now that I've quit, I save so much money and don't have that on my mind and it's truly liberating. On my breaks at work, I'll just listen to music, go outside, or use my work's massage chairs. It's just truly liberating to carry on through my day without ""needing"" a smoke to do it.",15

Maybe quitting isnt for me?,"After 3 years of smoking and 1 year switching to vapes, I tried quitting for the sake of focusing on my last school year coming up. Started taking SSRIs around the same time I quit. Unfortunately I ended up getting a panic attack due to new medication and vaped again to calm down. I feel so pathetic and weak.

I'm starting to think maybe I wont quit for a while. For me, the physical withdrawals werent the tough part, it was the mental game. Everybody says the first 5 days or so are the hard part, but the week 2 depression and tiredness is what got me. I don't think I can deal with brain fog for so long, hearing stories of it lasting a month or two scares me. I don't want to be unproductive and depressed for such a long time. 

The bright side is this is only my first real quit attempt, I bave a plan for my next one. I'll wait until SSRI side effects blow over and Im at the right dosage so it wont complicate things, then ill quit. Also after relapsing I tried out CBD and it worked well, so next time I'll definitely use that a ton.

Overall though, I'm not sure if kicking this habit is worth it for me and I need a pep talk. I'd rather have withdrawals when I can't vape rather than withdrawals constantly that I can't stop, and I'd rather not spend grueling months being unproductive and brain foggy. Quitting just makes me...feel worse? The upsides to quitting dont seem to outweigh the unexpected negatives. Maybe now is just now my time to quit?",6

i was on day 101 of my third quit attempt a few weeks ago. this was the longest i had ever quit and i was amazed i could make it that far. i had thrown away my juul and was out of pods, and promised i would not buy a new one. and that was true. then, on that 101st day, i found an old juul device WITH A POD IN in my closet. it was old, for sure. i smoked the whole thing, then i bought a pack of pods. i felt so guilty.

i almost instantly lost the ability to take in real DEEP breaths. the right side of my ribs/lungs hurt when i breathed in too deep. my heartbeat was faster, and i felt like a slave to nicotine again almost instantly. what i told myself would just be a treat with my coffee very quickly seeped back into all parts of my day.

when i ran out of pods on sunday afternoon, i wanted to revert to my old ways and go buy more. but i remembered that i could make the choice to stop. and it was really, really, really hard but i didn't. i threw away the device the next day since i knew i couldn't trust myself.

i have this delusion in my head that i can use nicotine sparingly, as a treat, or socially. my brain just doesn't work like that. yours probably doesn't either, if you're here. i thought that i could control the usage, and it would be casual, but i know now for SURE that i can't.

The guy I was with at the time hated smoking, so I developed a smoking habit just to turn him off me and gain some semblance of control in my life because at that point I had no one else and was incredibly suicidal. Part of me was determined that I didnt want to live past my 20s anyways so killing myself slowly through smoking was all I had. 

Im better now. With someone I love and whom I intend to marry and its now dawning on me that I dont want to die young and leave her alone and grieving.

Im trying to address the issue in therapy in hopes that closure will be the key, but its been a good decade now and even though Ive spoke to my therapist extensively about that period in my life I still can't quit the habit. 

Any advice? Im desperate. Thanks for reading.",4

My sinuses are blocked, I'm lethargic as fuck in the mornings, I can feel certain vibrations under my lungs, breathing heavily. Don't get me wrong. I can still play basketball, I can still work a lil and walk n shit like that. But even small amount of pull ups gets me trashed like hell. It didn't happen before, not so severely. I've started while I was 19.  Lethargy is insane. I don't even know what's happening to my body, whatever is happening cigarettes aren't helping. My teeth got all yellow  from inside (2 front ones from outside.. shit it grew), I'm really hooked on caffeine and cigarettes and just can't imagine even quitting them anymore.

I wish I had quit at beginning of this covid bullshit, the tobacco and weed prices raised a lot but tbh quality didn't really change even though they call it ''skunk''. Actually old weed used to get me in a more creative zone, but I don't know. I just know that there will probably be 2-3 weeks of agony.  After that I'll probably feel a lot better but still I'll slip somewhere when I start feeling normal because I'm a lonely bastard or whatever. It's insane how one night, bad situation, a glass of beer can reset a man even after 40 days (maybe even more people with sinus issues) 

I think I got really strong/good genetics and all but smoking killed a lot of my ancestors, it's ours Achilles foot.

At least this year I've got some audio/studio equipment, I've sold a few beats.. I'm also afraid my creativity is going to spiral for a while lol. (it will probably get better after my system clears out and while I get used to creating in a normal mood)

What got me through was knowing after 3 days, 72 hours, I was past peak withdrawal and every minute, hour, day, week, month the thought of smoking occurred less and less and then it was gone from my mind.

While disappointed, I‚Äôm pretty proud of myself for making it as far as I did and look forward to giving it another go as soon as I can. 

While my mindset behind smoking have changed a lot recently, I still enjoy it as if it were a hobby. I end up hating it  again as I am smoking the 2nd, 3rd, 4th cigarette of the day ect but always look forward and really enjoy the 1st. 

I caved in because I convinced myself that enjoying 1 cigarette would do me no harm. Obviously this is ridiculous as I‚Äôll always end up smoking more than 1 a day. 

Is there something in particular that you have told yourself that has stopped you from buying that packet?

The process was unpleasant, but not as awful as I'd feared.

Cue a life stressor and I was back to the 1ppd habit. Then COVID hit, I started working from home, had some health issues, stress through the roof. My 1ppd habit started creeping up and I'm now close to 2ppd, sometimes I even crack a 3rd if it's been a rough day.

I want to quit. I hate smoking. I don't want to use two 21mg patches, and 1 patch is inadequate (I tried).

This week, I'm in the office (I rotate in and out every 4th week). On these weeks, I use lozenges at work and only smoke in the morning before I leave and after I get home. My plan is to limit myself to 1ppd this week with lozenge use at work, then slap on the patch Saturday. Theoretically at that point, it should cover me, with the use of lozenges for cravings.

Then, I'll follow the normal plan for patches/lozenges like I did last time. Does this seem reasonable?

I'm not willing to cold turkey for a number of reasons, one of which being I absolutely cannot add feeling miserable and sick to already feeling miserable and sick (with other health issues), and I successfully used this combo in the past feeling a little uncomfortable, but it was mostly drama free so I feel confident I can do it again.",3

2021-06-07 16:01:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/num1mc/postsmoking_and_running/,Post-smoking and running,"Hey fam. Hope you're good.  


I started running a few years ago. When I say running, I am describing my beginners habit of 2-3 times a week, running maybe 2-3 miles per. At the time I was amazed with myself for being able to accomplish that kind of milage and the ability to develop the aerobic ability to run continuously *as a smoker*. That was the prize of it all of me: that this was something I could do and still smoke a pack a day. For whatever reason I really took some pride in that. I think I know why now- this was somehow reassuring me that it wasn't quite time to ""get around to quitting"", after all: what kind of person ran for fun? Clearly not people with debilitating habits like smoking too much for too long.

Fast forward a couple years and I've been smoke-free for about 6 months. 

The difference? Aside from the quality of sleep, the smell, my skin, the money, the shame?   
The biggest difference is that I am quite literally running 4 times that a week. When I quit I wanted to challenge myself with this running thing and signed up for a marathon. Nowadays I can run double digit miles without feeling it and can keep going if I want to; this was not a thing as a smoker. After a couple miles, you feel it and it's significantly harder to keep your breathing under control. Once you lose pace of your breathing, it's reeeeally difficult to get it back under control and it can kill your momentum immediately. Post-smoking, I am a very different person, and my new ability to run for long distance is one of the more fulfilling results.

While reading an essay in a run journal, I came across something that knocked me out cold- the writer describes their commitment to running every day and how it's benefitted him in the long term, not just with his fitness goals but with a healthy mindset overall. Many people would marvel at his steadfast approach and how disciplined he seemed to be (a common wonder of people who do not run who cannot possibly comprehend why someone would do that on purpose- I get it; I was one of those people!) His response was that there was no supreme super power, no stoic sworn oath to strict code, nothing extraordinary about this feat of physical exertion. **His magic gift was simply having his health and taking advantage of it.** 

As a former smoker himself, he made the point of identifying the advantage he had in front of him- removing cigarettes from his life- and taking advantage of this low-hanging fruit for better health, as something he had a choice to make, unlike almost any other debilitating health concern. Removing cigarettes and nicotine from your life is not born from some sort of magical ability- it's a tangible removal of something that does not make sense for your health. Yes, smoking cigarettes is a hard habit to break- no shit. But big picture: it is one of the only preventable health issue that we *do* have control over and can, should we desire, remove from our lives to be better in all ways. 

Not smoking cigarettes was the no-brainer and helped facilitate the writer with the *super powers*  everyone insisted he possessed. It starts with not smoking cigarettes and later unfolds into other habits we begin to develop over that time. Of course his habit of running so consistently is not just attributed to his smoking-cessation but you have to wonder how much easier things like this become when you break it down and work on the tangibles first. 

I hope I do not come off as trying to brag about this strange health habit I have further developed, as I am hardly remarkable in that there are many people better at this ridiculous activity than I am. But all things considered it makes me very happy and gives me hope in a lot of different ways, and it serves as a profound meditation on why I hope I will never fall for the trap of smoking cigarettes willingly ever again.

Hope my running people here in r/stopsmoking can share some of their impressions of before and after, too. Thank you for reading this far if you've made it. I'm proud of you for doing this difficult thing  of trying to remove cigarettes from your life, and am always here in DM if ya need someone to spill. <3",87

I have never been a heavy smoker, but I started at the age of 24 socially smoking, just a couple on a night. This built up to having a few in the evening with my house mate to ""take the edge off"" the evening sober. Probably the most standard start to smoking out there! 

Fast forward to 32 and I now now have a habbit where I smoke on my own in the evenings or at lunch time in an effort to feel less lonely. I managed to stop the desire to smoke when I'm drunk, that side doesn't really bother me becasue I don't want to be seen as a smoker and I don't like smoking around people. 

To give you an idea about my addition, this weekend I had quite a boozy Saturday but didn't smoke. Today though, at lunch I popped out and bought a pack smoked two then threw the pack out. Then after work I went and bought another pack, smoked two and chucked the pack out. This isn't a one-off, I regularly buy a pack to only smoke 2 or 3. But I do this most days. Almost like I'm kidding myself that I will finally quit. This is a very typical weekend. 

Does anyone have any advice? I think I need to find a way to be ok with spending time alone and this is definitley part of the addiciton.

To all of my younger smokers out there, take this message as a helpful piece of advice and stop smoking(i promise it's not worth it). I'm going to have my last smoke right now after almost 6 years of 1 pack a day, however this time I have to stick through with it. I've unfortunately contracted some very serious underlying health conditions because of smoking, which now affects me daily; emotionally, mentally, and physically. The only way to revert my issues is to STOP. here we go!!! to everyone else coming here, you can do it too!!!",18

So I've tried to quit smoking a few times the past year.
For some reason it seems impossible for me to get through day 5. The first 4 days are difficult too but it seems like on day 5 a demon will take control and directs me to the nearest tabocco shop to buy a pack.
I feel absolutely terrible right after, but it's happend 3 times now.
I know it's my own fault at the end of the day..

Anyone have some tips to survive day 5?

Thanks in advance!",9

it has really helped me to quit by thinking about the time aspect in terms of small, bite size achievements or milestones rather than worry about stuff too far into the future which may seem insurmountable and would do my head in.

think lil blip-verts of achievement successes

i.e. when first quitting ONLY worry initially about making it to 3x days  

note: 3, 7, 14 days are hardest then everything gets easier ... no not ""easy"",  ""easier"" lol

do not think (or try not to think) of how hard it ""might"" be or how fucked you ""might"" feel beyond these points, as everything in the quit journey actually gets easier with each of these timing milestones and each success will propel you onto the next one filled with pride, courage and enthusiasm of making that last achievement.

unnecessarily worrying is contra-intuitive to our quit success imho üëç


think -> I only have to make it to ...
3 days then 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, etc

am only just up to this bit myself but everything has gotten a noticeably easier to deal with at every one of these milestones - so the plan now is ‚¨áÔ∏è

45 days
60 days
75/80/90 days (whatever your pref)
100 days

or something like that, etc, etc,

but the ONLY thing I let myself worry about achieving or focus on is THE NEXT milestone...  not one up ahead in an esoteric far off future.

my target now is 45x days

thinking in terms of small time markers gives me a nicer, more achievable, more positive goal to strive for and reinforces every single milestone I pass as awesomely important successes rather than make me feel like, i.e. ""only"" making it to 100x days is ""really quitting"" or something

it's NOT ... every day I spend without cigs or nicotine is AS IMPORTANT as any other and I'm going to celebrate the entire journey!

much quit strength and determination to ALL  üôè‚òùüí™",3

I work out 6 days a week, if not 7, and I run every day, and have started filming content to make a motivational speaking brand. But I feel like a fraud as I've been smoking before and after the gym, running etc which is obviously very counter intuitive.

I've been trying to quit for a few weeks now by tapering, but I'm fooling myself cause I'll cut down for one day then smoke regular the next day and pretend I'm making progress but I just keep smoking and never quit

I know all the craving tricks, I know the worst will be over in less than a month, as I've done it before. I think I just need to put my inner ramblings into words so that's when I come to Reddit.

Keep in mind withdrawal is GOOD. The body is healing. Quitting will save me at least $100 a month. I'll have more ammunition to help other people with their own struggles by over coming mine. 

I'll run faster and farther. I'll lift heavier and get bigger. My body will process nutrients better. Better sleep.

I had been a cigarette smoker from 16-23. I quit cold turkey when I found out I was pregnant and I haven't smoked a cigarette since... But I replaced that with vaping a few years ago. Started the same way as usual - Socially. I wanted something to curb the social craving while having a few drinks and stupidly thought then that it was a better alternative until I read many articles on how it isn't actually a great alternative and could be even worse for you we just didn't (and still don't) have much scientific data on the long term issues - Just that it doesn't look good. I got pregnant my second child in 2018 and quit again cold turkey but a year after his birth we decided to move across country during the pandemic. I wasn't coping well and yet again slipped into vaping. It has been almost a year now of vaping and it needs to stop. I can feel the toll it is taking and I want to quit. I have tried many times before but I get triggered and start up again. I heard that replacing the behavior is one way to make it stick... Anyone had success with that method? What did you do to get your mind off the temptations?

Posting this to also hold myself accountable... Starting tomorrow. This current cart is almost out and figured there is never a good time to quit - Might as well be then.

Thank you for ""listening"" and wish me luck!

Several friends smoked, and it seemed like a cool and liberating thing to do, a new experience. I felt independent because I knew that it was something my parents wouldn't approve of, and I always felt so controlled by them growing up. It wasn't until a few years later that what started as this fun thing I used to do at parties became an addiction and something I felt I couldn't live without. As dumb as it sounds to me, cigarettes became part of my identity, and I didn't even seriously consider quitting until, one day, my younger brother whom I love very much saw me smoking. I'm not even sure if he noticed what I was doing (I was on the street and he was passing by in a car, I never smoked in front of my brothers because I didn't want to set a bad example). That day I decided I was going to quit. I have to say it wasn't even a struggle, I was so determined to not become a bad example to my younger siblings (I have a younger sister as well) that I just knew I wouldn't smoke again. Needless to say, I was wrong. I went through a bad experience and fell back into the habit. Ever since then (this was 4 years ago) every pack of cigarettes I bought was supposed to be the last one and it never was. Hundreds of them, probably. I don't know exactly why I keep coming back to it, but something about being so sure of my decision and not being able to follow through demoralized me. In every subsequent attemp to quit I just wasn't so sure anymore. A part of my mind was telling me that I would smoke again. I have OCD (edit: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder), also, which certainly didn't help as I would obsess about the  idea of relapse to the point I was sure I was going to relapse, and then I didn't have the strength to keep going. And yet, here I am trying again. I figured I'd write this here because if I can do it, then anyone else can have some hope. Much love to you all and good luck.",9

I texted my significant other from the hospital and said ""This is it, I'm done smoking..my life is more important, and I need to be around for our son."" I got to my car after leaving the ER and said to myself ""this is it"" and smoked my last cigarette. Well, what I thought would be. I was so worried about getting a potential PE or something worse. I could barely even smoke it. It just didn't feel right. Over the course of the next few days, I didn't even feel the urge. I was strong. My significant other smokes as well, and I had maybe 3 drags off of hers over those few days.. I wasn't even craving it, but the stress of a life changing event was harder than I expected. 





Friday night I went to the ER again because my PCP suggested I go to get a CT scan to make sure I didn't have any blood clots in my lungs. Everything came back clear. I had 2 beers once I got home to ""celebrate."" And I gave in to the urge and smoked. I felt terrible doing it. I was barely inhaling. But like most smokers, alcohol is definitely a trigger for me. I had another one last night. Today I'm back at work after taking the past week off. I knew it would be tough, because I smoke a lot at work. I'm around a few other guys who do as well. I knew this would be the toughest part, but on Sunday's I'm all alone. I thought I could do it. I knew I shouldn't have grabbed 2 from my significant other's pack before I left this morning, but I did. Just ""incase"" because I'm always making excuses. And of course I just gave in and had one, and now I feel like an asshole. It didn't even feel good, it tasted terrible. My chest hurts and I feel like shit from it. But the craving was strong, like I needed it. I did so good up until Friday night. There's so many factors and triggers for me. When I left the ER last week I was so hell bent on never smoking again. I even texted a friend or two and said it was easy to quit when it's a life or death situation. And yet here I am, barely a week out and already giving in. 





I know I'm strong and can do this. But this is harder than I expected. I wish I never had that full one on Friday. I see my doctor tomorrow and I really didn't want to get any sort of nicotine aid because I thought I was strong and could do it cold turkey..but this is far more overpowering than I thought.

I had such streaks before (of about 6 weeks).
But immediately caved in yesterday. (And smoked about 5-6).

But it's really difficult for me to hang out with my friends without smoking cigarettes. All of them are smokers.
And I was able to go 6 weeks without smoking because I did not meet them.

ideally, the solution would be to stop meeting them until I can get a hold of this habit, but then I don't have any friends who do not smoke. So either it's hanging out while smoking or just staying at home. And in the later way, life seems to be boring. Me and my friends usually go on long drives to amazing places, sit there and smoke cigarettes while enjoying the nature. And resisting cigarettes on those places becomes difficult with everyone else smoking. And altogether avoiding these drives is also difficult.

Smoking is one of the many causes to get stressed and maintain stress!","I just realised this is the stupid cycle I'm in.

We want to have that feeling of rest. We are kidding ourselves by first increasing the restlessness by smoking. Then it wears off and bam.. I feel rest.

Smoking increases adrenaline. Adrenaline works on our mucles and central nervous system. Which after continuous amounts of adrenaline will stress out/burn out/become sensitized. We will feel stress.

*So by smoking we maintain/increase our stress-level!*

The 'stop-smoking' therapist should have told me this.. and I would have quit immediately.

Hope this helps people quit... this realisation and understanding of how our bodies work. 

I know I'll feel restlessness... but that's the stress I'm already having right now, I was trying to hide it with smoking. Working on doing less things that make adrenaline.",5

Started off as a reason to hangout with older friends and I understood at the time they were trying to keep it a secret from their parents, so me being an impressionable middle schooler understood that to be apart of their group I had to take up the same secret with them. So it became sort of a ""I can't snitch on you because you can easily snitch on me"" (we lived in a close knit community of immigrants).

So this obviously went on for maybe a year or two, they moved on from our little town and I was left on my own hanging out with other kids younger and my age smoking together in secret until I had to go to uni abroad around 17y/o

Uni didn't help at all, with all the stress and anxiety and depression that came with it. My smoking habits became even more worse off especially when we all started drinking. And the fact that our uni's front gate was called the smoking corner did not help at all.

Moving on I dropped out and joined a different college and this happened around 19y/o in a country that advertises cigarettes and over 80% of the male population (yes including kids) are smoking did not help at all. 

Now it's been almost 3 years since i've moved to this country and I've realized that this entire time smoking was just a gateway to a unspoken social club where people who started smoking for simple reasons come together later on as addicted nicotine fiends and smoke together while oddly just becoming friends through the cigarette.

We are all aware that it's bad but we all smoke it together anyway. Heck sometimes we openly praise cigarettes if the craving is strong enough.

So here I am after almost 9yeare of smoking and 7000 dollars wasted am clean for 10days and honestly I never thought I'd make it past 2 digits. 

And I think if I can make it past 2 digit days I can make it past 2 digit weeks then 2 digit months and maybe I'll make it past 2 digit years.

Stay strong my friends üí™. We can all heal together !",15

However, regardless of how long I quit for, a drunk night out or some kind of emotional turmoil always brought me back. Since then, I haven't had as much success being smoke free for an extended period of time. I've managed to quit for maybe 1-3 months at a time, with longer periods of smoking. I've never been a very heavy smoker, and the amount of cigarettes has decreased significantly over the years, so the initial detox period isn't very hard for me anymore. What I really struggle with is staying smoke free. Over the lockdown, I didn't smoke for 5 months, and I felt the best I have in years. The reason it was easy for me to maintain was that I was totally socially cut off during that time. As soon as I went back to work & went back to seeing my friends, I went back to smoking. Social situations are a big trigger for me, and my biggest trigger by far is drinking. I'm not sure what to do anymore, because I know that I'm not strong enough to beat this on willpower alone. I've been trying to do that for 7 years and it's been fruitless. I don't know if quitting aids like the patch or nicotine gum would help me, because I think I'm more addicted to the behavior than to the nicotine, but I feel like I do need some kind of help. Have any of you struggled with quitting in a similar way? Have you found anything helpful?

My motivation for the past year has been an elective surgery that I've really been looking forward to. I was so sure that I would be able to quit smoking, because the surgery was so important to me. When push came to shove, and I didn't quit smoking in time and I had to have it postponed. I still haven't set a date for the surgery, because I'm still smoking and don't trust myself to quit on my own. Now, I really want to look for a different strategy so that I can be smoke free for my surgery and remain smoke free afterwards.",11

All of your posts and encouragement to others helped me get to this point. Also I apologize for formatting, on mobile. I've been a pack a day+ smoker for 12 years. 

The journey so far- about a month and a half ago there was a mass shooting at my fiancee's place of work. He ended up in a bathroom with a man who'd been shot in the chest trying to stop the bleeding. When he came home I thought ""Thank god, you're too young to die"". 

A month later he's driving home at 4 am, a man ran into the road and being unable to avoid him my fiancee hit him. He was our age and went to the hospital in the critical condition. I thought ""He's too young to die.""

A week after this I visit my doctor due to strange medical symptoms. My doctor tells me it's a 10% chance I have a brain hemorrhage or aneurysm. I thought ""I'm too young to die"". As I left the office, stressed from the news, I lit a cigarette. I stared at it in some new found sense of mortality, and thought ""29 is too young to die"". 

Today is day 5 free of cigarettes for me. I am fully confident in myself and committed to quitting. In this world any day could be the last, and I've finally found the resolve to get everyday I can out of this life. Good luck to everyone still looking for the resolve and godspeed to everyone on the journey.",19

It was hard as everyone knows and I always relapsed back, the most progress I made was when I read Alen Carr's book, and it was just two days without cigarettes.
I realized recently that I would not be able to stop if I were to do it cold turkey. So for the past two weeks I've been smoking one less, every day. Before that, I was a pack-a-day smoker, and now I'm down to seven. Tomorrow is gonna be six, and so on.
I'm very very happy with myself, I never thought I would be able to do this but here I am, smoking less and less everyday. I think this method can be applied with any time frame like one less every week, every two days, you name it.
I just wanted to add my perspective on this struggle because most of the time what I see in here is people going cold turkey, but that doesn't work for everyone, at least it didn't work for me. And that's okay! Sometimes we need to ease into it, and I imagine it will probably get harder the next week but I need to be patient with myself. 
Anyways, I hope this helps motivate someone, if you're decreasing your intake, you are still making progress! There's no need to be so hard on yourself.

I guess spending 3+ years having nicotine the moment you wake up is a tough thing to let go. 

I know everyone says to avoid coffee when quitting, but the thing is I never drank coffee until now, so I never associated it with smoking thus it isn't a trigger. Instead of my morning nicotine, I've been drinking a cup or two of coffee to wake myself up instead. 

I'm curious if anyone else ended up doing this and how did it work out for you? Personally I figure even if I end up getting addicted to caffeine, that would be a waaaay better addiction to have than nicotine.",2

From all of the people I've met who either are smoking or stopped smoking and haven't smoked. Here are the summaries of my experiences with some personal opinions

1)non smokers: people who never smoked would just say why do you need it? And that makes sense to me. 
   Somebody who started in around early 20s should totally be like okay I was fine without cigarettes earlier I spent 20+ years without smoking then why can't you quit. I mean you watch the same fucking show eat the same fucking shit drink the same fucking shit then why will your life be any different if you didn't smoke.
Still that makes sense so I come to ground and distract myself.

2) Quitters: smokers who previously smoked and have stopped now. Kinda nice to see people who have done it, motivates you to persevere.
  But whenever I talk to someone like that, I realised that all of them had something some solid unwavering reason they wanted to quit. They felt like shit, they got fucked up health issues saw someone die of cancer. 
Which makes me wonder because I don't have such a solid reason. My life hasn't changed much during periods of smoking and non smoking. And I go through relapses. I have had couple so far. Once it was 1 month, the other time it was 3 months and currently it's been about 2 months+ and going.

3) smokers: people who currently smoke and the relapse people. I don't care much about them.
  I always get them because I'm in and out of smoking given my own relapses. It's hard, you want to smoke it, maybe it's become a ritual or it's a escape or it's a get together at work break. And yes I have felt it hard.
When I started I smoked 2 times a day after lunch and after home at work. Then it increased about to 5-6 times. And this March I smoked about 30 cigarettes in 3-4 days. So I put a stop on it. Cold turkey idk how long will it go idk.

Whenever I get a craving I'm trying at my end to think like the non smokers, but the lack of a strong reason makes me feel like I'll relapse. I'm just holding on at the moment for how long I don't know.",3

This is my first post in this Reddit forum, and I have already posted about my troubles in another subReddit called ""Relationship Advice,"" so I will relate some of my story here. My husband and I have been together for six years and married for three. When I met him six years ago, he vaped because he had stopped smoking cigarettes. He relapsed into smoking when he took the job at Boeing to alleviate stress, as he works long hours. That's the short part of my story. 

When we were on vacation two days ago, I brought up the subject of his smoking. I told him all the health risks associated with smoking, and that I couldn't believe he would still continue to smoke after all the horrible anti-smoking television commercials out there. He said that he understood the health risks, it's just that he didn't want to quit because he wasn't ready. When he said that, I said that he was being selfish, and it was obvious he didn't love me anymore because if he did, he would make every effort in the world to quit. He sighed, then rubbed his face with his hands, and then said, ""Look, you know I love you to pieces. It's just that I don't want to quit right now."" After that, we changed the subject as I wasn't getting anywhere with him.",1

‚Äî-------------------

Waking up 'fully' in the morning. 

Being my best self and using the full range of my faculties. 

Facing the myriad anxieties I have, of failing or making a mistake without flinching and still giving it my best. 

Being confident enough to speak my mind. 

Trusting myself. 

Keeping my weight under control. 

Not having mental blocks to my thought processes when I get nervous about something. 

Stopping regarding myself as inferior. 

Facing the deep sense of dissatisfaction and self hatred  at my weight, looks, voice, abilities, life progress and a hundred other small things for exactly what it is... A compendium of lies I tell myself to not have to try as hard. Cause if I failed when I was trying my hardest, how could I go on? 

Facing the fact that I had cornered off a piece of my mind that I always allowed to carry on telling me I was on the cusp of failure, and that I wasn't good enough. 

Nicotine helped suppress it temporarily and gave me a rush of renewed energy.... but every time I knew I had to face the truth, I'd reach for another piece of gum or a cig. 

The truth was, that that 'part of my mind' was me , believing an alternate and false version of reality where I am always to blame, where my achievements are always surprises and unexpected (as opposed to the natural fruits of my labour), where I am on the edge of catastrophe and I just need the rush to keep going. It doesn't make sense because it never rested on the truth in front of my eyes, but rather on a filter built on worrying and asking the question 'What if?' again and again and again.

They was all a lie I told myself... 
Because I was scared.
And I found a drug that made it seem OK to believe it and not face it for what it was. 

I don't need nicotine for telling myself it's going to be OK. Whatever happens I can face it. 
I will face it. 

I don't need a crutch to walk and I never did.

Once went cold turkey and lasted about a month, and once tried slowly cutting off but never made it to zero.

My best was a few years ago when i smoked five cigarettes a day. Once at 11am, after lunch, after work, after dinner and before bed. I was like that for abiut a year but now I'm up to at least ten a day. If I'm out, I'll probably smoke more.

I have fears of letting go of this thing that's been in my life for almost half of it now. I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night because I'm coughing. I wake up my girlfriend doing so. I want to quit so badly but i also like the damn thing. I like it at those daily 'events' like lunch, the first coffee, after getting home. It's become a ritual. It's stupid but i feel like i won't be able to enjoy a plate of food the same way, or a coffee, or a beer with friends because the thing that's gonna be on my mind will be 'where's that cigarette?

Everytime i buy a pack, i regret it later and always think to myself that if i hadn't bought a pack last time, I'd already be on my way to quitting.

I hope you are doing well.   
I (22m) started smoking back in February of 2019 for the first time and since then (with a period as a non-smoker from August to March of 2020) I've been smoking around 10 to 15 cigarettes a day, but since last week I started smoking I guess more than 20 per day ( I don't count how many I smoke). Since I'm making my own rolled cigarettes I hope that that doesn't count as 20 normal ones.   
My life is a stressful one, as it is for most people, but I'm afraid to stop because I won't know what to do of myself. I'm an University student so having exams puts too much pressure on me.

Just wanted to share my experiences of quitting smoking as I feel many of us come here to check if certain symptoms or ailments they are having are due to quitting smoking (at least that is what I did!).

I also added what has helped me in this process. 

In the last 5 days since I quit, I have experienced the following:

- Full-body aches: literally everything from my skin to my joints hurts.
- Irritability: I am very snappy and short with people
- Brain fog: my thoughts seem to be moving at a very slow pace and I can't think clearly.
- Lack of focus: I also have ADD, so this has made my attention span even shorter and I cannot stay on any task for a very long time.
- Blocked sinus': it feels like my head is full of phlegm but actually when I blow my nose, nothing comes out
- Inability to sleep: I am waking up multiple times during the night and my bed time became a few hours later than usual
- Urge to eat: I am feeling pretty hungry all the time.
- Emotional instability: all I can describe it as is feeling emotionally raw and very sensitive 
- Cravings : honestly cravings have been quite minimal so far! 
- Skin: my skin is veeeery oily and is breaking out a lot more than usual. 

What has helped so far:

- Painkillers: first few days I was taking a combination of paracetamol and ibuprofen
- Caffeine: I am sure this would be not recommended by the doctor but I for sure needed an extra cup of coffee before I was fully awake in the morning
- Water, and lots of it: I feel like my body is craving it so I am drinking a lot of water and de-caffeinated tea.
- Light exercise: a walk helped a lot, but I also notice if I pushed myself enough to sweat I felt better afterwards.
- Distraction: hanging out with people or watching shows has helped
- Sleeping aids: yesterday I took some Valerian before going to bed. It knocked me out but I still woke up multiple times at night.
- Being super kind to myself: my body is going to nicotine withdrawal so I am trying to be super kind to myself to get me through 
- Healthy snacks: I want to eat all the time, and to avoid gaining lots of weight, I have healthy snacks available(hummus, celery, carrots, grapes etc.) 
- Sitting through the cravings: the feeling will pass rather quickly. I just waited a few extra minutes and I noticed the craving was way less... 
- Facemasks: I have started every day with a cleansing facemask. It has been a nice self care moment and my skin is thankful too. 


All in all it has surprised me that smoking and quitting smoking has such an effect on my body. Like obviously I knew smoking was bad for me, but that quitting smoking would hit me this hard... I honestly feel like I ran into a brick wall and now I am recovering from it üòÖ. 

If you are just starting your journey - good luck! 
And if you are further down the road, please share some tips!!!

Or is this a crutch that I will regret?,"1 week into quitting (10x year smoker, 5x year chain smoker - 3rd or 4th attempt, I cannot remember) and using the patch so far to avoid cravings so I can survive my stressful job.  I have a couple questions. 

1. With the NicoDerm patch, it seems like there is a ""schedule"" of sorts to wean off of nicotine by using less powerful patches over time. Has anyone had success with this? My fear is that I am simply passing the ball of nicotine withdrawal to my future self. I know at some point I will have to stop nicotine in all forms, but if I wean does that mean the craving/withdrawals will be easier at that time? I feel so much better already better without smoking, but right now I am definitely still addicted to nicotine. 
2. I have already started feeling the positive health affects from cessation of smoking cigarettes (hair,smell,teeth/mouth), but I am wondering what negatives I am still putting on my body by providing nicotine daily. 
3. I feel no need to smoke at all, and have already stopped the smoking routines and hangups I used to have. Is there any drawbacks to simply staying on the patch the rest of my life? I was smoking at least 10-12x cigs per day, and now I only pay $35 for a week supply of patches. The way I see it, worst case is I buy these patches and still save $ compared to the cost of my old smoking habit. 

 I feel like a coward for not maintaining cold turkey cessation, but I do realize that I am still on the right path and have already reaped the benefits of non-smoking in the meantime. I met a girl on Sunday (she told me I smelled good and asked for my number) who later told me that she would not have agreed to go on a date if she knew I was a chain smoker. I finally have some forward momentum, so any insight you guys have would be much appreciated. As far as subreddits go, this is probably one of the nicer groups I have ever seen, so I figured I would finally make a ""my turn to quit"" post and at least try to strengthen my game plan.",13

First impressions: It comes on normally, but the coughing phase is way different. Sorry if this is graphic, but mucus came up really easily and quickly. In the past, the cough would start slow and linger for weeks, sometimes months. It would only be productive (in the sense that I would expel mucus) if I coughed till I was red in the face or took endless Mucinex. 

It‚Äôs only been a couple days, but there is a marked difference. Also. Not forcing yourself to smoke with a sore or sore-ish throat, or a fully congested head is nice.

On the patch. Started level 2 which was 14 mg over 24 hrs. I wore each patch anywhere from 6 to 14 hrs a day so I was not getting the full nicotine exposure. 

Now I'm on level 3 which is 7mg over 24 hrs and I'm wearing it about 12 hrs a day. The cravings are definitely stronger but none of the horribleness from cold turkey like headaches, anxiety, or lightheadedness. My lungs haven't coughed anything up yet either so I'm hoping that may not happen to me. Kind of noticing my mood is a tad bit more unstable but meh.

Biggest challenge? Oral health. Oh my god my teeth and gums hurt. I haven't been to a dentist since I was a teen and I know I have to have periodontal disease as my teeth are exposed super low and my gums are receding. The sudden blood flow to nerves makes it so painful after eating anything. My mouth bleeds horrible after flossing but I'm sticking to it. Hopefully I'm not beyond hope but will be seeing a dentist at the end of the year.

Other than that? I'm running more and can breathe. Blood pressure and bpm has gone down. More energy and better moods but unsue if that's due to less nicotine or more sleep and exercise. I know it's both but can only guess the ratio. 

Typing all of this out because I really want one right now but the store is 10 minutes away and I'm already in bed dozing off.

Smoking damages a lot of blood vessels in the skin which causes premature ageing, Smoking then damages the entire cardiovascular system which targets your entire organs which makes it harder for your body to function.

Why people smoke even though they know the negative impacts is because it's highly addictive this is because of the nicotine contained in cigarettes the nicotine encourage the body to need more once it's consumed

How to stop the addiction of smoking is to exercise, eat healthier, fight urges and triggers and contact a doctor if you can't stop

Every day when I wake up now, it amazes me that I no longer smoke!  I made it a habit to jump in the shower as soon as I'm up.  It is nice to be able to smell the subtle fragrances of the soap or shampoo.  After that I look forward to my morning cup of coffee!

When I do think about smoking, I immediately recall how horrible my lungs and my body felt when I used to smoke, the ashrays, the cigarette butts, the filth, the restlessness, the yellow stains on my fingers, the filthy coffee table on my porch, the anxiety, my stinky clothes, the phlegm and the coughing . I have always hated all of it.   Good riddance, I never want to be  a pat of that again.",46

I go hiking/camping a lot and almost every time I find myself smoking almost twice as much when I'm sitting beside a campfire - and that was exactly the case last weekend. I then asked myself if it is really worth it, and after a bit of hesitation I threw the rest of the pack into the fire.

So far the mornings have been alright but once lunch time comes around at work my mind starts going all over the place, same when I get off work. I've also had some bad stomach cramps too. Today I noticed my lungs have started to feel a bit weird, like something is there and I almost need to cough but don't, I guess they're starting to clear out a bit.

In my head I go through a lot of internal dialogue, arguing with myself about smoking. Trying to validate it, questioning it, making straight up dumb excuses (like ""just buy a pack of blues instead of reds, it's alright"" lol), calling myself out for that dumb shit too. I had a 3 week and 7 week breaks last year. Didn't smoke much during the summer either. I didn't have nearly as bad withdrawals then even though I was smoking more before my last break, now I seem to be fidgeting a lot just after lunch and when I'm about to get off work.",7

I kept telling myself that a few hits would be fine and that I would continue on nicotine-free after that. In a moment of weakness, I decided to take a few hits. I ended up probably taking five or six hits that night. It burned like hell and tasted much more disgusting than it had in the past, so I stopped. Well, what I thought would just be a slip up was worse than I expected. The withdrawal started again. I‚Äôm now a week in and while it‚Äôs not as difficult as the first time, the physical and mental symptoms are like 60 percent as bad as the original quit. My anxiety and irritability are extremely high, brain fog and headache are still going strong, and I‚Äôve been feeling pretty depressed. Those few hits were not worth it.

I'm the youngest of 6 kids. 2 of my brothers, 1 sister and both parents smoked. Some might say that me picking up smoking as a teen was predictable. I was 17 and it quickly grew into a pack a day, and even 2 packs if I was drinking.  

I'll be 34 in 5 days and I can honestly say I always thought I'd be a lifetime smoker. But I've been in this self imposed slavery of feeding that addiction and destroying my health.  But today I no longer have to carry that stigma and shame that comes from telling non smokers ""yeah.... I smoke cigarettes."" 

A few things about quitting:

First off, I know this is a cliche to say, but if I can do it, anyone can do it. I was a hardcore smoker, and a chain-smoker on my worst days. I had convinced myself that I loved smoking, but deep down knew that was bullshit, while surrounded by people who also smoked, and gladly supported me smoking, probably to feel solidarity in their own addiction.  I was absolutely, hopelessly hooked, and spent 16 years just giving in to the idea that I'd be a smoker for the rest of my life. 

Secondly, do research, prepare yourself mentally, make the commitment, and if you fail, don't cave in. Failing once, twice, 3 times doesn't mean you have to give up. The guilt of slipping will never match the guilt you likely feel from constantly subjecting yourself to an addiction that deteriorates your health, stains your teeth, weakens your pride, makes you feel like shit in the morning, and alienates you as ""the smoker"" in crowds. 

Finally - and some people aren't going to like this one, because they might feel it diminishes the accomplishment - it was not nearly as difficult to quit  as the world had made it seem. The tobacco industry benefits immeasurably if you think it's ""impossible"" to quit, or to even think about living without that little hit of nicotine every 30-60 minutes a day.  It's a crutch for stress, anxiety, motivation, focus, relaxation - the list goes on. And the further we give in to that crutch in moments of mild to severe stress, the weaker our ability to deal with those situations gets. You don't ""need"" it. It's an addiction, and ridding your body of the drug takes around 5 days. Every day after that is so much easier. 

You know you don't want to be a smoker, so give yourself that freedom, because it feels great. Get out of the trap. 

This is the ridiculous paradox of the addiction of smoking:

Smokers spend their lives wishing they could smoke while not being able to, or smoking while wishing they didn't have to. 

Quit. You can do it.",46

______________________

it doesn't matter if you fail momentarily ...

... it's all a learning experience and with every attempt at quitting you will get stronger, become better at doing it, understand yourself, your body and mind more each time until finally you WILL succeed. 

you CAN do it!

no it's not ""easy""
no it won't be pleasant 
yes it's fucking crazy difficult
yes you may turn into a horrid, temperamental asshole temporarily until your quit stabilises.
yes everything may annoy and drive you crazy
yes you WILL probably feel like shit for a while


and yes ... in a nutshell you are addicted to poison and your body and mind will play the most manipulative shitfull tricks on you to to get you to refill those nico levels

BUT ...

after 3 days it gets easier
after 7 days it gets easier
after 14 days it gets much easier
after 30 days it gets much much easier

etc, etc, can you see the pattern?  ü§ó

don't be afraid
you are much stronger than you realise
you got this  üëåüí™üëä
keep going!!!

do whatever YOU need to do to be calm and sane and keep your quit

i.e. move into a motel for a week rather than fight w your partner if YOU feel it's all too much

take a couple of weeks off work to avoid smoking culture and stress if YOU feel it's necessary to your quit success 

take long hot baths every day, fuck the water usage, if it helps w cravings and lets you de-stress ... it's about YOU now.

...whatever it takes, whatever YOU need


because it doesn't matter that you fail momentarily IF ... you keep trying to quit and never give in!!   üëÜüíôüôèüíö‚òù

it only matters if you give up trying   

never give in
never surrender 
you ARE worth it
you ARE amazing
you ARE loved
you ARE needed
you WILL succeed 
you WILL be free 

do NOT berate yourself 
do NOT beat yourself up because you relapsed

just acknowledge that you fucked up momentarily 
set a new quit date
and TRY again üëçüòçüíüü§©‚òù

bottom line ...you're an absolute legend for trying!!!!",12

I‚Äôm afraid to go out into the world and socialize because I don‚Äôt smoke or drink anymore. My anxiety is telling me that if I do I‚Äôll immediately relapse and be miserable. I‚Äôm watching my mom smoke right now and I just have this undeniable envy. 
Even though I‚Äôve been doing really well, every once in a while I‚Äôll have dreams of smoking, but last night was the most vivid. I sucked in on a vape without inhaling, ‚ÄúFrench inhaled‚Äù some into my nose and immediately stopped/woke up really worried that I did that irl. The taste was spot on/so familiar. I hate that my head is taunting me like this. I just want to be free/like I never smoked.",11

I‚Äôm also not sure if I should quit cold turkey or quit cigarettes immediately & vape for a couple of days then quit?

I think and when working I end up smoking. So naturally I went to smoke then realised this. 

But last night I was generally upset or angry not sure for what, just a very sad day in the head. So I had half a smoke, do not even recall the stink as it means I was lost in the head.

Hence I‚Äôve developed a kind of situational addiction to cigarettes - I love smoking them when I am drinking. 

I have never had a cigarette when sober and would say I‚Äôve never even had a craving when sober, but as soon as I start drinking I begin craving one. 

I am considering getting a vape (Blu, Juul type thing) to replace the cigarettes, but I fear this will result in me 1) smoking a crazy amount of vape on nights out when drinking 2) more concerning, getting addicted to the Vape and ending up using it 24/7 throughout the week like some of my friends do and then using it for life. 

Are these valid concerns? Has anyone had experience switching to a vape in this scenario and how did it end up? I‚Äôd probably try and just quit fully but coming up to the party summer period I feel like I‚Äôd be destined to fail and this may be a good bridge.",3
