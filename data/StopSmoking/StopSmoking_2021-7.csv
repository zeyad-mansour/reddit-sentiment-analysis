Smoking now makes me feel like I felt the first time I ever smoked a cigarette, which is sick and gross and clammy and shit.

My question is, have you known anyone who DIDN'T feel that way after their first smoke? I'm unable to recall how I powered through that disgusting feeling to get to the level where I didn't vomit every time I smokes.",3,0

I picked up vaping while I was in rehab, and haven't quit since. It was my biggest mistake in recovery. The last time I quit, I was below the legal smoking age in my state. Now that I'm 22, I waste exorbitant amounts on vaping and smoking accessories. 


I went to the doctor for a checkup, and I have lung damage. It's not a lot, and he said that he was glad to see me before it got too serious. He said that at my age, it could even clear up in a few months, if I quit now. Who wouldn't take that deal? I'm not sure which caused more of it- the vaping or weed- but I've alternated between smoking each heavily for almost 3 years. It's alarming to be faced with my mortality and the consequences of the disease of addiction. I don't even remember what healthy lungs feel like. All I know is that I need a new way to live, that doesn't involve any smoke in my lungs. 


The mental hoops for addiction are baffling. I've given and received newcomer advice several times before. But I could use some support and new coping skills. What is it that made you quit, and what would you say to someone who has yet to quit? Thank you for any and all feedback, and for humoring my post.",7,0

So 2 months ago I smoked the last cigarette in my pack before going to bed and when I woke up the next morning my first thought was ‚ÄúI need to get to the store to buy a new pack‚Äù and that struck a chord with me when I realized just how dependent and controlling my life was around them. I instantly decided I was done. Quitting someday is something I think every smoker talks about but a lot never follow through with it. In that moment I decided I was done.

This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve ‚Äúquit‚Äù but it‚Äôs by far my most successful and I know it‚Äôs going to continue.  I‚Äôve had some cravings here and there, even had a dream one night I smoked but I‚Äôm so happy with how things have turned out for me.

One of my biggest fears with quitting was going through withdrawals. I have a short temper as is and I feared how on edge I would be when quitting but i actually received a lot of comments from coworkers and friends that my mood had improved the further along I went without smoking. 

For those of you struggling with it everyday or if you‚Äôre wondering if you should quit. It‚Äôs been one of the best decisions I‚Äôve made in my life in quite awhile. Keep pushing if youre struggling and if anyone needs to talk you are welcome to DM me.

I'm 17 and first quit when I was hospitalised for pneumonia and sepsis. Nearly dying was definitely a shock and given all my pre-existing health problems, including asthma, I decided that my body deserved better.

That was in February. I've tried and failed three times. I think the most difficult thing is that I live with three other smokers and they all smoke inside, in the car etc. I try my best to not smoke but I'm constantly surrounded by smokers, ashtrays and they offer me cigarettes.

This time I have been smoking for about 2 weeks but trying to stick to a max of 5/6 a day (huge improvement) but I think next week I will quit (again). I've tried many different methods but I think going cold turkey would probably be best for me.

I'm posting this hoping for a bit of motivation, but mostly to hold myself accountable. Now I've told you all that I'm quitting, I can't turn back now.

-take some deep breaths breathing in and out as much as you can
-take in a slow deep breath and hold it as long as you feel comfortable with and than let it out slowly
-you should get a head rush that almost mimics a drag and you should feel a little relief

I‚Äôve been on a mission to quit smoking and a friend of mine suggested the QuitSure app (it‚Äôs free by the way!). It‚Äôs supposed to work by rewiring your subconscious brain to dislike smoking. It‚Äôs a bit hokey, but I really believe it will work for me. I won‚Äôt give away any more info because the app is supposed to be done in daily modules over the course of 6-12 days in order to work. Anyway, one of the video exercises reawakened a very deep memory of the anti-smoking programs they had at my school in the early 90s. Does anyone else remember [Smokey Sue smokes for two](https://www.healthedco.com/79210-Smokey-Sue-Smokes-for-Two-Model?quantity=1&custcol_item_source=www.healthedco.com) ? I remember being 5 years old sitting in my kindergarten classroom when the principal brought that doll in and actually lit a real cigarette in the mouth of the dolls head. In the classroom. Full of children. The 90s were wild.. that brought another deep memory of how everyone used to smell like stale smoke.. especially kids clothing. 

Anyway, I often lurk on this sub and I really appreciate the content, thank you everyone for encouraging me to start my quit journey. Tomorrow I will smoke my last cigarette and hopefully be free <3",3,0

I posted this on another forum and folks seemed to like it so thought I would share. 

Well here we are folks. 452 days smoke free and 7693 cigarettes not smoked. But that's bullshit - once you've quit, it doesn't matter if it's day 1 or day 1 million - quitting is quitting.

I have 5 points I want to make - these aren't 'steps' to follow or 'golden rules' - I'm sure you'll find that somewhere else - this is just me talking to you and hoping it might help you. So here we go.

Ok wait - you might know you're not ready to read this yet, so maybe save this post and come back to it. It's not going anywhere.

Point 1 - I fucking loved smoking

I'm 37 now. First cigarette at 13. All these folks that say they hated their first cigarette; nah I fucking loved it. I didn't *properly* start smoking until I was about 19 but was certainly smoking whenever I could up till then. And such it was until 452 days ago. I want you to know that I loved smoking and didn't really want to stop. And I don't think it matters if you smoke 5 a day, 20 a day or 60 a day or 'only when I drink.' Addiction and habit are addiction and habit.

Sure I tried quitting. When the indoor smoking ban came in the UK in 2007 I didn't smoke for 8 months. That was cold turkey and the easiest thing I ever did at the time. Getting *back* onto smoking 20 a day was also frightfully easy too. More on that later.

But eventually, I started to hate the smoking. 

Actually, that's a lie - I still liked the smoking - I hated being a smoker. Not planning ahead and walking to the shop in the pissing rain to get more. Or standing out in the pissing rain to have a smoke. Or getting myself super-stressed when I expected to be able to smoke but a meeting over-ran and I couldn't. Or I had that chest pain. Or the thought of going somewhere amazing on holiday was tempered and dampened by 'that sure is a long flight that I can't smoke on'. My wife began to get increasingly frustrated that I would need to smoke two cigarettes one after the other before we did anything that meant I couldn't smoke within a couple of hours from then.

I liked smoking, I just didn't like being a smoker.

So here's the thing - hate being a *smoker* even if you like the actual smoking. They're similar but different.

Point 2 - Either plan your quit or seize an opportunity

Me, I seized an opportunity that presented itself and I was very lucky. I had plenty of opportunities in the past that I ignored. My opportunity? I was furloughed from work for a month and on the evening before my first day of furlough, I smoked the last cigarette in my pack just before bed. I didn't plan it, it just happened. I wasn't stressed about it because I knew I could go at my leisure the next day. I thought, 'you know what, I kinda wanna quit, I can always buy more tomorrow if I really can't face it, but I'll see how I get on with not smoking.'

Being furloughed was a change in routine. I couldn't blame the smoking on work stress now. But I knew I'd smoke just as much, if not more with no work to keep me busy. And I was earning less and cigarettes in the UK are expensive. But the change of routine was a blessing with fewer 'triggers' and especially no trigger for that first one of the day during my commute.

So - either create an opportunity or seize one. 

Actually, maybe it's 'don't set yourself up to fail.' You like to smoke in the garden through the summer? Don't try and quit in May. You like to smoke when you're out with friends having a good time? Don't try and quit when you have a wedding to go to in a couple months time. You have a holiday coming up and you don't want the stress? It's cool, just think ahead and find your window. You can create your window or it can present itself to you - you woke up with the hangover from hell and you're out of smokes? Smoking ain't gonna make you feel better - you got a cold and smoking tastes really weird? Boom - there's your window.

Point 3 - Failing isn't just ok, I recommend it.

Oooooh it's contentious! Of course, I don't mean you should just start smoking again if you have already quit. No, what I mean is that I learned way more about quitting from my *failures* than I did these last 451 days of not smoking. Remember I said at the start that Day 1 or Day 1 million are the same?

The lessons I learned for those that want to get ahead....

There is no such thing as just one cigarette. One leads to more than one. Always.

There is no such thing as *wanting* to smoke - don't kid yourself, you will soon *need* to smoke, just like the rest of us. Smoking is something you either do, or you don't do. There is no in between. You don't opt in and out like that with addictive substances.

Be aware your lesson might be that 'you are just not ready yet' - I learned that lesson back in 2007. It's ok, a lesson is a lesson. Don't be down about it. Once you realise you're not ready, *you will know when you are.* Boom, lesson learned. Once you have one cigarette and realise, 'actually, yeah that was cool, I will have one a week, that's ok, but man today was a BAD day, so I'm going to have one now and then I'll have my proper one later....' BOOM lesson learned. TAKE THESE LESSONS WITH YOU.

Point 4 - Reward the bejesus out of yourself.

Everyone says you will save money when you quit smoking. It's bollocks. You don't. Anything you spent on smoking gets absorbed into everyday bullshit and then one day, you're feeling down, you have nothing to show for the fact you quit and 'fuck it, I'm buying some.'

Get yourself an app that tracks your quit. How many days, how many smokes, how much money. Now, withdraw from the ATM, *all* the money you are not spending on cigarettes. Seriously, I stopped doing this when I had a half inch thick wad of notes in my hand. I had ¬£700 / c. $850 in notes. It was ridiculous. I was making so many trips to the cashpoint I ended up banking them and going twice a week to withdraw ridiculous sums. It was an eye opener.

Now - here's 2 key points. If you feel weak one day you have to realise that one cigarette will cost you way more than whatever you have in your hand right now. Way. Fucking. More. It doesn't matter how much you have, double it and add a zero I don't care, that money is GONE son, with interest..... 

The second point is FARRRKING SPEND THAT SHIT.

Seriously, I bought a holiday to Rhodes for my wife and I with the money I saved. Then I bought an Xbox. A few months later I bought a top-end gaming PC. You need to SPEND that money on YOURSELF. You have given up smoking, make sure you have something to show for it. You know that joke about 'oh if you didn't smoke all those years, you'd be able to buy a Ferrari - and the guy goes 'oh yeah, where's your Ferrari.....?' BUY YOUR FERRARI. Get a massage. Get a magazine subscription. Fuck it get get a high class escort for a night. Make sure you reward your achievement.

Point 5 - We smoke to feel like a non-smoker.

Of all the books, all the hints, tips, tricks, strategies, motivations, suggestions and 'tools' this is the most important statement you can read. I should have started with this but only if you made it this far will it probably actually resonate with you so fuck it, it's just for you. I'll say it again - *we smoke to feel like a non-smoker.* How crazy is that? I used to feel fucking amazing after a smoke. Relaxed, happy and chilled. Sated. I realise now that smoking made me more stressed. It made me stress about when I would get to feel relaxed again. I don't 'get given' the opportunity to relax by smoking now - I just don't have the anxiety that the smoking gave me.

Smoking is like fixing a hole in the hull of your boat with another piece of the hull of your boat. Smoking is the solution to it's own problem. If you get rid of the problem you don't need the solution.

So -

Pick your moment.

Remember the lessons you learned from your failures

Spend every penny of the money you save on stuff you want, or stuff you want to do. Just fucking splurge it anyway you want, it's guaranteed to be a better use for it than smoking.

Final point, and I nearly put this in the lessons bit but wanted it to stand out. When you decide to quit, **stop waiting to feel like a non-smoker.** Don't think that one day you will just wake up and think, 'phew, I don't feel like I need to smoke anymore.' It doesn't work like that. You think you can just suddenly forget about something you did MULTIPLE times a day, maybe an hour for YEARS?!

On the contrary I think about smoking quite a lot. I ***think*** *about it* but I don't ***crave*** *it*. For a few weeks after I stopped, every time I got to that point of my commute where I would normally smoke I thought, 'hey, I'd normally smoke right now.' And I did that multiple times a day.

But it reduces. And slowly you start to forget your triggers. Until you don't even *have* triggers anymore. Until eventually you get to the point where you think, 'I'm thinking about smoking now but realise I haven't thought about smoking in ages.'

I *never* thought I would quit.

I know I will *never* smoke again.

I wish I could take how that feels and inject that feeling into anyone who wants it. Where I am is so far from where I was. Honestly I am no different to you. I'm not stronger than you, or luckier or less addicted than you or got less going on in my life. I'm not asking you to quit right now. I'm not even asking you to quit. I just want you to know that ***I know*** ***you*** ***can*** because ***I did.***",328,0

I was a chain smoker for 22 years and quit not for myself but to prove a point to my husband. I am a stay at home mom and dont bring in any income. Cigarettes are expensive, my husband also smokes but I smoked more. Every single day he would lecture me about how much he is spending a week and that if it was just him he'd quit buying them....basically blaming me for the both of us. 
   So I quit, I did it out of spite to prove a point. This is literally the hardest thing I've ever done. I am not the typical ""quitter"" I loved cigarettes. The taste, the smell everything but the price. I wasn't pressured in to smoking young I did it on my own. I was 11 and lite my first one alone in my bathroom. The instant lightheaded feeling I got I loved it (bad sign) i got permission to smoke at 13 so there was no hiding and i always had someone to buy them. 
    Now that I quit I don't know what to do with myself in a sense. My body keeps asking me, so what are you gonna give me? Like I'm missing something. My 13 year old is happy I quit but doubts I'll make it. My husband isnt as supportive as I hoped. He isn't smoking around me like I asked. But day 3 I was crying through a craving and he told me to give up and smoke. I didn't but wanted to so bad. 
      I've been thinking about getting an e cig to try and help me but I dont want to just trade an addiction. I've been using nicotine mints/gum for intense cravings. I've also slighty cheated by smoking some cbd just to feel smoke, but that makes me sleepy. The withdrawal alone makes me so tired any advice on something to give me energy would be nice.

But. If we *do* relapse, and our count goes back to 0‚Ä¶we should be kind to ourselves. So many people (myself included), have had that moment of weakness and finally given in, and then we think ‚Äúwell, I failed. 90 days down to 0.  I guess I‚Äôll try again some other time.‚Äù

Fuck that. Try again the next day. After you‚Äôve had your last one for the night, douse the pack in water and throw it away. Make the next day Day 1, and be proud of it. So often our shame leads us to keep smoking. 

Fuck that shame. Don‚Äôt be afraid of 0.

What has helped me is instead of counting days without smoking, I calculate the percentage of days I haven‚Äôt smoked since a certain time. It helps.

I only actually used Champix for a total of 2 weeks, I continued smoking up until day 7 and had zero withdrawal symptoms when I decided to come off the Champix early 7 days after. It was honestly confusing how easy it was, I can't remember side effects but it definitely gave me a stomach ache on an empty stomach initially. No depression, no crazy dreams of decapitated bodies etc.

One year later and I had stupidly picked up smoking again over winter and now I'm back on the Champix since 5 days ago. I did try cold turkey around a month ago but the withdrawal symptoms and living alone made it really hard and I only lasted around 10 days. I've probably tried to quit 50+ times in the 10 years I've been smoking, the longest cold turkey attempt was probably 30 days.

I see reports of other people saying they are still smoking 3 weeks in using Champix - For me, I'm only 5 days in and I barely can be bothered to smoke 1 whole cigarette a day, it just tastes disgusting, the same as last time. That normal feeling you get when you inhale just isn't there, it just tastes like burning leaves, there is no ""hit"" to it. It makes smoking pointless and naturally I just forget to even smoke.

It's possible I am a really good responder to Champix, if that's even a thing. My conscious mind always wants to quit and dislikes smoking, but I feel the subconscious is the part that gives me the cravings. My theory of why I found it so easy before and hopefully I will again, is that when I smoke on Champix, it tells my subconscious that smoking is not satisfying, and the cravings don't happen later down the line.

One weird symptom I've been having this time though is dreams and old memories that I didn't know I had. For example I keep dreaming about this girlfriend that I had over 10 years ago now and that era. Every dream I have is so vivid and she is always with me, and all the other people in the dreams are school friends from around that time. It's seriously odd, the dreams feel like they go on for days. It's happened consistently now for 3 days.. Outside of sleeping it also seems I keep thinking about really old memories as well out of nowhere. Luckily that's the only noticeable side effect for me, but yeah it's kind of creepy.",4,0

2. Have been a binge smoker since the age of maybe 15 or so. I'm 33 now. Never really smoked during the week, with the exception of a couple of years after the birth of my first child where I smoked 2 or 3 cigarettes every night. HOWEVER, whenever I go out, even just for dinner with friends or anything, I smoke very much, like half a pack or a whole pack over the course of just a few hours.

I feel not many people understand that I still absolutely CRAVE cigarettes after going without them for a couple of days or weeks. Like, after having not smoked for a couple of weeks, I know I will subconsciously seek situations where I know I will get to smoke again. I will go out etc. even though I may not even particularly feel like, just because my mind associates that with cigarettes and the urge to smoke is just so pressing.
4. On average, i'd say I smoke one or two cigarettes per day like this. Probably somewhere in between. Probably closer to two, because there are occasions where I smoke constantly, like on holiday in the evenings or when I have a rare day off from my kids and spend it with friends or similar.
5. I don't feel that just because I don't smoke everyday and don't smoke like two packs a day, this is any less serious. Yes, more is probably always worse, but I can already feel some effects. Like, my breath would probably be a bit deeper without smoking at all. Plus the lung cancer risk and so on. Also, I don't feel like I am maturing out of this. It's a downward trajectory, rather. While it started with like one cigarette every month as a teen, over the years the amounts and frequency have become higher and higher to the point where I am now. Like, I now use even the slightest (non-)occasion as an excuse to buy a pack and chain smoke it away with ANIMALISTIC GREED. It started with parties, but it's become holidays, meeting my cousin and his girlfriend, staff outings, a friend from work visiting me, going to sauna with friends, stopping by at a friends place, christmas parties, ... . The most ridiculous occasions (excuses), basically.
6. This is all an endless source of self-hatred for me. When I wake up the next day to everyday life, I absolutely LOATHE myself for having done this to myself again. I pledge every time to never repeat it again, ""this was the last time"", ""now, this time it was really actually seriously the last time"" and so on, ad infinitum, and I have always ended up doing it again. I can feel my nails curling up if I think about the feeling of waking up the next day after a night out, my lungs completely tarred out from having binge smoked. I hate myself, thinking about my children losing their dad to lung cancer etc. for the next few days, while the taste and soreness of smoke in my throat reminds me with every breath how much of a failure I am for having done this to myself again. God, just thinking about this I absolutely hate myself again for what I have done to my friendly body over the course of so many years. That feeling of waking up, the sun up bright and mercilessly exposing everything (me!) while I breathe shallowly after having smoked as much as I physically could the night before in many cases. Plain horrible, thinking about it I just want to dissolve and vanish from the face of the earth.
7. My main reasons for smoking are that I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT. I know that I am addicted, it is horrible for my health etc., but that feeling of lighting up a cigarette when I have not smoked for some time, then violently inhaling the smoke, the smoke filling even the most remote corners of my lungs... oh god it's absolutely orgasmic. Always loved it. I have a glass of wine or beer most nights after work but could probably easily quit that without thinking about it again. Don't enjoy it remotely as much as cigarettes. Yes, just love the feeling, the smoke, sometimes the deep conversations when sharing a cigarette. Just everything. Other than that, a factor may be that I am the (much) higher-libido partner in my marriage. That's alright I guess, I have accepted it, one partner has to be after all. But I personally am lacking excitement and only cigarettes could ever fill in for that. I could hypothetically do sports after my lungs have regenerated a bit, but I think it would be artificial. I am not sure I could deceive myself like this in the long run. I don't want a runner's high or anything, I want a SMOKE! - Fatalism plays a role too, I guess. Like, I have broken all my promises regarding smoking so often already that it feels normal by now. Probably the guilt while smoking is part of the excitement. Living in the moment, not thinking about later, ""this is it"" and so on. Stupid, I know. But I have always been a  hedonistic and sexual person, that's just what I am. I like pleasure, sensations, excitement. (I have a boring office job as a tax lawyer by the way, in case that sounds too interesting)
8. My main reason for quitting binge smoking would be my kids, and less also my health. I personally find my life a bit boring with marriage, a mortgage, job and all, and if it was only me I would probably just give in and continue forever. Life is not that great, anyway, it's just life, constant tasks, and I never understood why some people aim to live for 5000000 years. But I feel a deep responsibility for my three kids. They don't deserve growing up without a dad because daddy decided to rather smoke himself to death not caring about anything. Even more, I don't want to become a burden to them by becoming sick.

EDIT: Want to add that nobody in my family knows I am a smoker except my wife, not even my parents or my kids. The stigma is so big nowadays, that's probably why I always hid from them the fact that I smoke and turned to strictly binge smoking. ",7,0

I have a long history of attempts to stop smoking. Besides a lot of smaller ones i got two times til about day 60 and one time over day 90. So i know, that i can resist the urge, if i really want to. And making repeatedly the mistake of getting hooked up again immediately, if i dare to even make only one ""exception"" is a valuable lesson. My next attempt to drop this disgusting habit is already scheduled and i made an appointment with my doctor to discuss possible medication to help me quit. 

So i hope to mild down the extreme cognitive dropouts i experience every time i do without and prevent ravenous hunger attacks. With every of the three longer runs i gained a lot of weight. Treating myself with food is something that is really hard to resist for me. And the bare knowledge of the consequences does not stop my stupid ass. And yes, for this time a strict fitness program is already planed.

I was wondering, if anybody made good experience with accompanying medication and if so, wich one. The only thing i don't want to use are nicotine products like nicotine patches, gums or sprays. I already researched some medical helper like Bupropion, Varenicline or Cytisine.

I'm trying to quit for the 4th time this year.

I am really curious, how you are dealing with the problem of the combination of drinking and smoking.

A short backstory:

I'm 31 years old and I have been smoking for 15 years. The last 10 years I smoked a pack a day.   
As I turned 30, I decided, that the time is right to quit smoking.   
During the same time, I decided not to drink any alcohol, just to see how my body will react to these changes :) Everything went quit smooth, until one day I decided to have a beer with a friend of mine (a smoker). And literally 20 minutes later I smoked my first ciragette after 3 months of abstinence.

Now this year I decided, that it has to stopp completely.

It allways goes surprisingly well, until I see my friend on a weekend (all heavy smokers), and as soon as I get my first or second alcoholic beverage - can't resist the temptation and I start smoking again.  
I have to add, that it is me who grabs the pack of the friend and take one without even asking - it's not them who are offering cigarettes all the time :)

What were your strategies to stay strong in this scenario?

How did/do you approach theses kind of siautations?

I'd love to hear your stories, tipps and infos to this topic.

Kind regards

I have been asking the gods for months to give me the strength to either taper or quit my usage of cigarettes and they have given me tonsillitis as a method of forcing me to stop for at least two weeks while I heal. 
Hilariously enough, I finally went to the doctor yesterday after 5 days of struggling to breathe on the first day of my period, and started a round of antibiotics. Today I can breathe a little better with the help of the medicine, but I have a STRONG urge to fuck it all up by smoking. But also it's time to take this opportunity to follow through on my word and abstain. 

The last one I had before it hurt too badly to breathe at all was on Friday after work. I started initially because a lot of people in my family smoke and I thought it would be the most socially acceptable method of self harm I could participate in. I want to stop hating and harming my body, if being mean to it worked, it would have worked by now. I want to set a good example for my youngest brothers and I want to break these generational curses. It's going to be hard to break the patterns I've created in my brain but I still have some neuroplasticity left (im 22) and I can do it. 

However, between how sick I have been, my period starting, other regular stressors, and now the psychological withdrawals I've been a REAL BITCH to my boyfriend cause I've been hella reactive and short due to already being at several of my limits. I have decided to make use of nicotine patches while I begin to cut them out of my life to avoid the worst of the symptoms of quitting cold turkey- I can not afford to be more on edge than I am to begin with. $44 dollars though, and now I have $89 to get me till next next Friday. At least $40 of that won't be spent on cigarettes again. I hate the habit, I hate being a slave to nicotine, I'm tired of being cruel to my body. I want to be able to be strong and capable again. 

Today it took everything I had to go to the grocery store and make dinner, I'm making breakfast for my boyfriend for tomorrow and doing laundry and writing this before I go take a long and HOT shower to mitigate the pain, open my airways and wash the cravings off of me. 

When I'm done being sick I'll start taking the dog on longer walks in the evening, despite my boyfriend's objections, I think he'll understand that it's something I need to do while I start this process of quitting for good. 

So besides showers and long walks, what other habits have you all replaced smoking cigarettes with? Any tips for navigating the emotional hell I'm about to endure and how to make sure I don't take it out on the people around me?",2,0

im using patches which is how i managed to get over those 2 days (currently on my 3rd day) but i realised very quickly that a big part of smoking is the action of it and keeping my hands and mouth busy and not just the nicotine, ive tried using gum and toothpicks but its not really helping all that much. and another problem for me now is studying.

im homeschooling so essentially im teaching myself and its getting really stressful and the patches only help with stopping getting cravings but they dont satisfy in terms of a buzz or a throatkick. another thing is the breaks id take in between studying where id be listening to music and smoking was (as corny as it sounds) the most peace id have throughout the day because my fam is hectic and all up in my ass the whole time. ill still keep using the patches until im done with the 3 months but i need a way to replace the extra things that come with smoking apart from nicotine (some alone time, a buzz, smth to do between study breaks)

For some people, I feel like they smoked to be cool or fit in or what have you. When I was a kid, I would steal cigs because I was so curious about it and just thought about it all the time. I guess that's addiction for you- getting addicted before even doing the thing. 

And that's where I find myself even as an adult. I suppose in the mental health arena you'd call it ""intrusive thoughts."" But I just think about smoking constantly. Even in the years that I quit, I just never stop thinking about it. I see someone smoking in a car and turn to look for some reason. I hear a lighter and I can't help but turn around and see what's going on. It just reminds me of being a kid before I ever even lit up a cigarette. 

Am I the only one whose quitting journey includes some of these ideas? Growing up around smokers, I've always been super obsessive about smoking. I know some people can say ""I quit four years ago and now I don't even think about it. Hate the smell and everything about it"" but that hasn't been my journey at all.

It's like smoking has booked a room in my head rent free and won't ever leave, even after I haven't smoked for four years (barring a recent minor relapse, which has now been over a month ago).",12,0

I want to say sorry in advance for many posts I wrote here and here's another one :/

I started smoking in February of 2019 when I was 20 and I stopped in August but relapsed in February of 2020 and since then I've been a constant smoker and since 2 months ago, I've been smoking a pack or more a day.

When I was a teen I hated smoke and cigarettes, like a lot. I felt depressed at one point of time ( I was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and I wasn't taking meds regularly) and I saw people smoking all around me in the streets so I thought why not try, maybe it would help me and that's how I got addicted. Now, whenever I feel anxious I smoke and whenever I eat or do anything I smoke. I still don't like it but I just don't think about how I don't like it anymore, I just do it, even though I hate the look of myself with a cigarette in my mouth. It reminds me of all the people from my childhood and puberty who smoked and whom I didn't like because of it.

I feel dumb, I feel as if I became less smart and more stupid. Now when I see that for example Kurt Cobain smoked I'm thinking that's cool, he smoked and I should smoke too. Before I'd never thought like that. What happened with me?

Sorry for this, I just wanted to vent.

Here in the bronx and I'd assume other places at least to some extent, its as easy as just going down the block and spending 50 cents, & that's how it began. Since then I've been using alot of thc oil, blunts, cigarettes, vapes, you name it, which carried its own set of negative conditions. The habitual investment across time ended up being crippling, as a lack of investment towards my own health, & constant cigarettes lead to me being a type 2 diabetic, yes it is genetic at least to some extent but I still feel to this day it could have been prevented. You guys may not believe this shit but the tradition in my family is 21 division voodoo, & when my mother had a divination it said I would get lung cancer if I don't stop, I've bought around 4 packs since then, and 2 days ago I bought some American spirit green. Everyday I cough and spit constantly, & I'm a afterschool teacher In union Square. I've been boxing for 2 years and doing jii jitsu for 4. I'm in a position currently where I don't need to stress smoke, or realistically smoke at all but I'm at the state where the damage gets more and more visible everyday. & with every cigarette I smoke the worse it gets. I had quit nicotine a handful of time but the most memorable one  was a couple of months ago, I dont reflect on that feeling as much but it was very liberating. For 9nce in my life I didn't feel as bound as I am currently. And after the 3 day he'll its like you never want to go back, to get lung cancer In my 20s is tragic, but im in a position where I have outlets to prioritize,the boxing keeps me managing my health alongside the diabetes. I have outlets and reasons and people who want to see me grow, and I'm at the place in my life where it's now or never, the kids I work with are worried about my health, and I feel like im losing my sight more and more everyday, cigarettes are fucking stupid, I wish anyone who wishes to stop to know that they can and that it's possible. But you have to really want it more than you can ever comprehend. & once you start hating it keep hating it. No turning back. I'll start once this pack finishes. My strategy is spacing and pacing, being my pattern of smoking is this, wake up walk out cig, get off train cig, lunch break cig, & ending cig. The ones that can pass from a general perspective is all around. But the morning and ending are usually the main mood shifters, & realistically I'm in a position where I can change my life. No turning back as i said earlier. And always work on what you feel is impossible be answered eventually it will be possible. Good luck to everyone here.

I quit together with my husband in November 2019. We were very good for around 8 months, and when summer started and life loosened up somewhat, we both started smoking again.

Of course we justified it by saying 'we haven't been smoking so long, one won't hurt, quitting wasn't that bad'... I'm sure I don't have to explain.

Since then we've quit and started again which must be like 8 times now. We can quit for two months, smoke for a week, quit again, start again,...

It's kind of fucking with my head because I've obviously demonstrated that I can quit (by which I mean, I always dreaded quitting so much and thought it would be impossible to do) but it's the staying off the cigarettes which is proving to be difficult.

The kicker is every time I smoke again after a while I feel so incredibly sick and disgusted, and yet... Not to mention how much better I feel and how much more time I have when I'm not smoking.

I feel like I've wrapped my head around the fact that cigarettes are disgusting and bad for you, I really **feel** this, instead of it being an abstract concept. Yet I fall for my delusions time and time again.

Every time I started again I was sure I would quit again, so at least I didn't throw in the towel completely, but I'm getting a little tired of this game I'm playing with myself.

I realised that my fifth anniversary of no-smoking is coming up, which made me reflect on that awful period and what kind of advice would have helped me back then.

My story is like that of many others. Tried smoking as a teen, got hooked, and smoked about a pack a day for 8 years. I tried to quit for 4 out of 8 years ‚Äì yes, half the time. I have more unsuccessful quitting attempts then some people have had hot dinners. I am ashamed to admit it, but it is the truth. Luckily, I did succeed eventually, so let me tell you what eventually did work for me. I did it by focusing my attention on what I call *the stretch*.

Let me explain that. When you quit smoking as a heavy smoker, your withdrawals will start after an hour or so. After a few weeks, that period slowly but steadily *stretches* out to longer periods. It is a great way to measure your progress in quitting smoking. Once you realise you are stretching out the withdrawals, you will notice that you are one step closer to quitting, empowering you to continue.

|Days of not-smoking|When think about smoking?|
|:-|:-|
|0 - 30|Every waking hour|
|31 - 100|Every other hour|
|101 - 180|Every three hours|
|181 - 250|Every five hours|
|251 - 365|Every 24 hours|
|366 - 500|Every few days|
|500+|Weeks without|

&#x200B;

There is more good news, because every tier you drop, the withdrawals get weaker. I am now in the '500+-tier', and I still get what you could call a nicotine-craving once every couple of months (!) or so, but when it does appear, it is more like a vague reminisce than a real craving like in the first tiers, like wanting to be back on that beach you were during a holiday. It is nowhere near as vicious as the early urges.

I do not believe in nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). The problem of your smoking habit is your addiction to nicotine. And you can not get rid of an addiction by feeding your body that substance you are addicted to. You have gotten yourself into this mess of getting into smoking, and you must face the consequences of the withdrawal ‚Äì smoking withdrawal is incredibly uncomfortable, but it will not kill you. Take it on the chin. Just focus on the next tier, it gets easier along the way.

That isn't to say that you can't do anything to ease the withdrawals: get into situations where you don‚Äôt smoke, especially in the first 100 days. I noticed that I didn't smoke when I walked; so I walked 25.000+ steps a day in those first few weeks. Also, I didn't smoke in the shower, so I had three showers a day to wash off the withdrawal. Everything is allowed in the first few weeks. Except smoking of course.

Hope this is of help to anyone.",115,0

I was here a while ago, quitting smoking while going through a tough emotional time.
For the most part, I have quit.

I hate smoking otherwise, I don't like it during the day, I don't like it with anything including coffee... The problem is that I was a massive smoker, I got over it all.

The last hurdle is drinking. I seem to be okay when I'm off the booze, but the moment I'm on a night out... I want to smoke!

I'm so upset by this behaviour. I was off the booze, on and off for a long time because of sciatica. The alcohol instigated the bad back and leg pain, so I gave up for more than 6 months. 

Now it's summer, I've been going out (UK), and it seems to be getting worse when I'm out.
I drink with my friends, and somewhere down the line I'm inhibited enough to steal cigarettes and start smoking.

I don't know what to do, I get really upset about it. It's a cycle of fun and guilt, and I don't know how to stop smoking when I'm drinking?
Does this mean I have to be a non drinker for the rest of my life? I drink 2-3 times a month, it's not even excessive.. but I end up smoking when I do.

I'm so ashamed. 

Any tips or tricks to stop this? I don't want to feel like I can never drink again...üòî

It doesn't seem to bother me otherwise... How do I stop smoking when I drink?
I have successfully stopped smoking everyday otherwise. I was a smoker for 15 years before I quit, and now.. I'm stuck with this drink/smoke cycle... everything else is fine otherwise...


Would love any insight on what worked for you. So far, I stay away from cigarettes when I don't drink - the moment I have a sip of alcohol... It's over! 

I stopped drinking for the most part because I had sciatica... But now it's better... My irrational brain doesn't seem to care when I drink.

I don‚Äôt even want to do the math on that one. 

So many times I tried and failed. I‚Äôd get 2 or 3 days, and start up again because ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt the right time, too much stress or too much going on‚Äù or ‚ÄúI will just have one‚Äù... all the things that cigarettes whisper in your ear when you‚Äôre trying to quit. 

Like so many others, my life since March of 2020 has been... complicated. Kept waiting for things to settle down so I could try to quit smoking again. We all know how that goes. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

This summer has been so crazy stressful. Like so bad my poor husband (who quit smoking 20 years ago) started smoking again. 

I finally figured out 12 days ago that there is never a ‚Äúgood‚Äù time to quit, things were always going to be a chaotic mess, and I‚Äôd always manage to put off the quit or continue to justify why I kept smoking. 

So, I loaded up on nicotine gum, smoked my last cigarette, shrugged my shoulders, and decided if I could quit in the middle of the mess of my life I could probably do anything. 

I‚Äôm 10 days in, closing in on 11, and I‚Äôm kind of doing ok. The brain fog has been really tough, I‚Äôm tired of being grumpy, can‚Äôt sleep to save my life, but it‚Äôs ok. Those things will pass, as the cravings will pass. 

Some positives I‚Äôve noticed in the last 10 days:
* my face looks so much better
* I‚Äôm not coughing all the time, and my allergies are much less intense
* I don‚Äôt have to plan my workday around smoking
* my anxiety is almost non-existent (this is huge!)
* I can be around people that are smoking and not smoke. Because this is MY CHOICE. 
* I don‚Äôt smell bad
* I‚Äôm excited to check my quit clock, and love watching those numbers (time, health, money saved!). 

The nicotine gum has been a lifesaver - I could not have done this cold turkey.  I decided I was going to chew as much of that as I needed to throughout the day, because it was still a better option than smoking. I also decided that if I wanted to eat, I was gonna eat. And if I gained weight, so bet it. It is still also better than smoking.

That's the mentality I'm trying to keep at least.

 I've been using stage 2 patches and 4mg lozenges as needed for cravings and it has been going well so far. I think my real test will be at a concert I'm attending tomorrow.

My SO, who smoked significantly more than myself, is also attempting to quit with me. He has alot of stress on his plate and we are both being very supportive of each other. I'm also worried that if he slips up that it will make it harder for me not to slip.

Currently in my mid 30s, and was a decade long smoker until I quit for 6 1/2 years.  I was aided by WhyQuit.com and the idea of approaching thinking about nicotine as a true chemical dependency, rather than a ""habit.""  It actually blew my mind and helped me quit.  And I was a happy non-smoker too.  I could drink, hang out with smokers, and enjoy all the normal life events that I would have had to have chain-smoked at in the past.

Unfortunately a couple of years ago I began to falter, and the desire and curiosity to try nicotine-free vapes got the best of me.  Long story short, I eventually smoked that first cigarette and here I am a couple of years later right back at square one, a pack-a-day smoker.

I'm looking forward to quitting, though I don't have an official date yet.  Depends on when I finish the book.  I also look forward to being able to share in the journey here from time to time.  

TL;DR  Long time smoker, quit for years, fell into the slippery slope of vaping, and right back to being a smoker.

It was stressful night and a coworker offered me a cig to help destress on break.  It quickly turned into 1 cig a night during break.  Then 3, one for each break.  Then five, 1 for each break and on my way to and from work.  In a couple of months I was up to half a pack.  In a year a full pack.

  By 2008 i knew I needed to stop smoking.  I tried, God I tried.  Nothing worked.  Cold turkey, patches, gum, vape, reducing, switching to light cigs.  I gave up.  Felt a failure.  Then in 2014 i wanted to try again because smoking for 10 years?  All that money wasted?  Damn it.  I couldn't do it.  I tried in the end, I did. 

My health declined.  Slowly.  One puff at a time.  Got diabetes.  Oh well, puff puff.  High blood pressure.  Give me a pill for that so I can puff puff.  Cough up blood, meh it really isn't because of smoking puff puff.  

June 25th, 2021, i got a call from my doctor.  They needed to see me asap.  I have too thick of blood, most likely cause is smoking.  Could be genetic though, and then again it could be something else.  Doc set me up with a blood specialist.  To run tests.  At a cancer facility.  Cancer.  I cried. Curled up to a ball and cried.  I did this to myself.  I might as well have put a gun in my mouth and pulled the trigger everytime i lit up.  

July 1st 2021 I smoked my last cigarette.  What got me through is three thoughts.

Life before Death.  Smoking is killing me.  If I don't stop my life is over, and im not going to let smoking control my life anymore.

Strength before Weakness:  Being a God damn man means that I need to be strong when I have no more strength left.  Courage is doing what needs to be done, when you'd rather be doing anything else.  A hero will face that which he is afraid of, and stand strong in the face of weakness.  Even if I am only being a hero to myself.  

Journey before Destination:  The most important step a man can take is the next one.  One step at a time.  One day at a time.  Some days it's one hour at a time.  And some hours its been one minute at a time.  But I keep going.  My journey is to stop smoking.  As long as I keep going, im still on that journey.  If I quit, then I'll have reached my destination of failure.  But so long as I keep going, i have not failed.

Smoking wants to kill me, it stalks me like a wounded animal.  It lies to me, tells me that just one puff and I'll feel normal.  I can quit tomorrow.  Or over the weekend when not at work.  One last one for old times sake.  And I realize, that anything trying to kill me, will also lie to me.  

My appointment at the cancer clinic is Aug 2nd.  I am now 19 days smoke free.  I am.scared.  it may be too late for me.  I may die.  But if i do have cancer, then I choose to live my remaining days on my terms, not on cigarettes terms.  And even if it's too late for me, it's not too late for you.

I made my bed, im going to have to lay in it.  I beg you, leave before you have to lay in yours",148,0

( I am so sorry about the quality in advance, but i tried! i am still relatively young)","In some American states and cities, cigarettes are banned. At a glance, this seems quite logical keeping in mind the fact that cigarettes cause/are related to more than 500,000 deaths per year. Furthermore,  around 48,000 deaths occur each year from secondhand smoke exposure as well as increasing chances of numerous diseases and cancers. Cigarettes have near no benefits other than fueling one‚Äôs addiction, but on the flipside, there are always reasons to keep cigarettes legal. 

First, we can all mostly agree cigarettes are bad for your health. Cigarettes have about 7,000 chemicals in their smoke, namely 250 which are harmful. Of the 7000 chemicals , a few notable ones are arsenic ; a chemical commonly found in rat poisons, and butane, which is found in lighter fluids and is mostly considered unhealthy. If cigarettes were to be banned, the risk of second hand smoke exposure would also likely go down. Second hand smoke exposure ‚Äúaccording to experts, can lead to increased risk to emphysema, cardiovascular disorders and respiratory problems. (Ayres 3)‚Äù. Another factor which many consider in banning cigarettes is that they would decrease pollution. Cigarette butts are the most commonly littered object in the world, and cigarettes also play a role in polluting the air around people especially in indoor/enclosed spaces.  Along with the issue of littering cigarette butts,  cigarettes are non-biodegradable and can clog waterways and other important filtration functions. The banning of cigarettes would limit chances of fire in enclosed spaces as well, considering that they must be lighted to be used. All in all, cigarettes are very unhealthy for humans which are not designed to inhale chemical gas bombs, however we still have reasons to keep cigarettes- very few supporting overall health. 

The job requirements for being a vendor of goods naturally does not need very much specialized requirements, mostly just identification. In New Jersey as of 2021-2022, the requirements needed to sell cigarettes is a manufacturer‚Äôs representative license and/or a cigarette license.  This inevitably leads to the question of the cigarette banning‚Äôs impact on the economy, considering that each in 2019, cigarettes generated at *least* 385 billion dollars in **revenue** from sales alone. However, this is countered if you think about the estimated 500 billion dollars worth of damage cigarettes caused in the same year in the form of healthcare and cigarette related diseases. Further emphasizing the economic factor of cigarette banning, at least a handful of those who used to smoke might be inclined to purchase cigarettes off of the black market or illegal/third person entities, which usually does not benefit the government in taxes. The addictive nature of smoking would have to incline long time smokers to purchase from more shady retailers, especially if you view the repercussions of the banning / legalization of marijuana and other ‚Äúrecreational‚Äù drugs. 

With all of this in mind, I believe that cigarettes have no real health benefits other than an opinionated  ‚Äúpeace of mind‚Äù, and I propose a slight solution to the cigarette issue. What if cigarettes were not banned, however what if a 15% tax were applied to companies buying cigarettes in bulk? That would inevitably drive up the cost of cigarettes, and it would not run into the issue of everyone purchasing off the black market. Furthermore, this would support the government in the form of direct tax and incline the cigarette vendor to buy less. All of this ultimately adds up to less sale/usage of cigarettes (at least by a bit) and many of the finer details are not worked out, however this is the best I can propose as of now.",4,0

I started smoking in my early twenties because a woman who was way out of my league asked me at a party if I wanted to have a cigarette with her. So I pretended I was a smoker then, and then continued to pretend when we started dating, and kept pretending until I really was one.

About a year later, she seemingly lost interest in smoking and quit overnight. She would still smoke when she drank, but as time went on she did that less and less, and by our late 20s she hardly did it at all ‚Äî and regretted doing it whenever she did, having become acutely aware of the poisoning effect that non-smokers experience when they have a cigarette.

I, meanwhile, smoked every chance I got. I smoked alone on a park bench before work, believing that the pleasant early morning solitude I was experiencing was generated or enhanced by the cigarette. I smoked outside the office with older colleagues and bosses, or after work outside the bar, relishing in the conversations I was having. And I smoked out the window of my car when I was stuck in traffic, in alleyways between appointments, on my balcony at night in the dead of winter‚Ä¶ as I said, I smoked every chance I got.

When I wasn‚Äôt smoking, I was often thinking about smoking ‚Äî especially when I was unable to smoke. I still remember the end of a flight between Europe and Canada that was delayed on the tarmac for an extra 45 minutes after landing. I was so aggravated I was beside myself. All I could think about was how much I needed a fucking cigarette.

In my mid-to-late 20s I started using a vaporizer. By then I was ashamed of smelling like a smoker, both because I knew non-smokers who smelled it on me would think less of me and because my girlfriend, no longer a smoker, had complained about it.

Lots of people report transitioning immediately and painlessly from smoking to vaping. I remember it being hard, to be honest. I felt deprived of the ‚Äúthroat hit‚Äù that comes with smoking cigarettes, which by then I understood to be part of what was ‚Äúsatisfying‚Äù about smoking.

But I did make the switch... for the most part. When I would drink with a smoker, I seemed to always end up accepting their offer for a ‚Äúreal cigarette.‚Äù More embarrassing still, as the night went on I‚Äôd find myself asking for cigarettes, even though I‚Äôd made up my mind after the last time that I wouldn‚Äôt do it again. I felt outside myself in those moments, watching me be someone other than who I wanted to be.

Then, about four and a half years ago, I quit both. I'd made other attempts to quit before, but I never lasted more than a day and a half. But by then I was so ashamed of my addiction that I gritted my teeth through withdrawal and got to the other side. I lasted six months, and in that time I really did feel like I‚Äôd beaten it.

But then I had a significant setback at work at the same time that my father was diagnosed with lung cancer ‚Äî and some self-destructive voice told me that one cigarette wouldn‚Äôt hurt, and that it would give me some temporary relief to my troubles. Before I knew it, I was a smoker again.

That was four years ago. This time around I transitioned to vaping more quickly, recognizing that I could still be physically active while vaping, whereas smoking, for me at least, was incompatible with exercise. Just as important, however, was that vaping allowed me to better hide my renewed addiction from other people, which I‚Äôd become even more deeply ashamed of in light of my father‚Äôs cancer: ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is wrong with me?‚Äù was a relatively common thought, not that it did any good.

My dad died in late November of last year. He started smoking when he was 13 and kept on smoking until my older sister was born, about 30 years before the cancer showed up. I don‚Äôt know whether his lung cancer was caused by his long-ago smoking. I don‚Äôt even know if it was the lung cancer that killed him ‚Äî he was in remission as of last summer. But by fall, when his health began to rapidly deteriorate, covid hospitalizations were spiking and hospitals were forbidding any visitors. So we made the decision to forego finding out what was killing him so that he could die surrounded by his family at home.

I had intended to quit nicotine at the start of our lockdown (about 16 months ago for me). Granted, I ended up having a more difficult year than I imagined at the time. But still, it seemed like a perfect opportunity, and yet I didn‚Äôt manage to do it. I tried to quit a handful of times, sometimes lasting as long as 36 hours but often for no more than a couple. And then I was off to the store to replace the Juul I threw out ‚Äî or to buy a pack of cigarettes and a lighter to tide me over until I could find a place that had a Juul device in stock.

I‚Äôve come to truly accept that I have an addiction. Some people find the label of ‚Äúaddict‚Äù to be a relief. For me, it‚Äôs humiliating: ‚ÄúHow could I have allowed myself to do this to myself? How stupid and pathetic am I?‚Äù But now I've also come to realize that nicotine addiction, properly understood, is simply first-person proof that our brains are fantastic at rationalizing completely irrational thoughts, to the point that we will happily hold completely irreconcilable thoughts in our head at the same time, such as ""my nicotine addiction is ruining my quality of life"" and ""my quality of life would be ruined without nicotine.""¬†

But one of those statements is obviously a lie. And the lie is obvious to everybody except people who are addicted to nicotine. It was even obvious to me before I became addicted. The obvious truth is that people who aren‚Äôt addicted to nicotine are not missing out‚Äîif they were, everybody would be addicted to nicotine. But people who aren‚Äôt addicted to nicotine think smoking and vaping are some combination of bizarre, repulsive and sad. More importantly, unless someone is smoking or vaping in front of them, they don‚Äôt think about smoking or vaping at all.

That‚Äôs what I want for myself. So I‚Äôm off to break up with nicotine for the final time. Wish me luck.",62,2

I remember every reason why I started, most of them stereotypical: because the boy I had a crush on smoked, because everyone I thought was cool smoked, because it made me feel like an adult. But the biggest reason was to help my mental health. The day I started smoking, I had bombed a French test, one I should not have bombed. The reason I had bombed the French test was because I hadn‚Äôt slept one wink the night before, my mind churning with anxiety and depression. So I walked out of school, a cold January day, got on the metro and wandered around the national art gallery. The ground was covered in snow, and I was wearing heels. I genuinely wondered if I would make it another year of my life. On the way back home, I bought a pack of menthol cigarettes and smoked every single one of them. I threw up. Later that evening, or maybe later that week, I can‚Äôt remember, I was hanging out with said crush and told him this story (while smoking another cigarette). ‚ÄúMenthols?‚Äù he asked me. ‚ÄúWhat are you: a single mother?‚Äù 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Nobody ever talks about how smoking is the cheapest mental health care this country provides. That exorbitantly taxing cigarettes is not a deterrent, but yet another disproportionate cost on the poor & the mentally ill. Smoking got me through college, abuse, grad school, working minimum wage jobs. There were times when I legitimately thought to myself, ‚Äújust make it until your next cigarette break.‚Äù 

‚Äî‚Äî

Here I am, one year smoke free today. Not one single puff of a cigarette. I‚Äôm proud of myself. But most importantly, I continue to have compassion for past Paige, and all smokers today. Only you can decide if and when you want to quit. I don‚Äôt judge you for continuing to smoke, in fact I will literally always be fighting the urge to join you! I know the pain & anxiety & heartbreak that lead me to smoke. A year later, it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôve discovered some better coping mechanism. Despite all the cheery doctors telling me it would get better, my sleep has gotten much worse. But at least now, instead of telling myself to make it to the next smoke break, I tell myself to make it through one more sleep, and one more day.",39,0

I smoked cigarettes for over 10 years then vaped for 3. Last year, I managed to quit cold turkey for a month then stupidly relapsed (wasn‚Äôt even because I had a strong craving). Went back to cigarettes for awhile and then vaping again. It doesn‚Äôt feel very different to me because I‚Äôm still addicted to nicotine. 

It‚Äôs embarrassing. It was obvious when I quit because nobody could imagine me without a cigarette/vape in my hand. Only my close friends and partner know that I relapsed, everyone else believes I‚Äôve quit. To keep up with that, whenever I‚Äôm around colleagues or other friends, I hide in toilet cubicles to vape. At this point, everyone just thinks I have a weak bladder. 

I know I have to quit. Logically, I know that nothing bad will come out of quitting. I‚Äôve just been making excuses and putting it off. Sometimes I tell myself it‚Äôs because I can‚Äôt quit in case I snap at someone at work (but there‚Äôs always going to be work, right?), for a few months it was because there was a huge project and ‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt‚Äù. I know there will never be a ‚Äúright‚Äù time, but sooner will always be better. 

I don‚Äôt have too much of a reason to quit. Vaping didn‚Äôt make me lose my sense of smell and doesn‚Äôt make me/my home smell bad. It doesn‚Äôt cost enough to make a significant difference to my bank account. The only recognisable benefit when I quit before was that I felt so liberated. I didn‚Äôt have to panic if I couldn‚Äôt smoke, I didn‚Äôt have to stop any activity midway to go outside whenever the cravings hit, I felt like my body was clean and I slept so much better! 

Anyway, I‚Äôm down to my last pod and a half. At the rate I‚Äôm smoking, it‚Äôll last me another two to three days. This is usually when I get another order. I always buy in bulk, so I know that if I place another order it‚Äôll just be another few months of ‚ÄúI‚Äôll quit when this is done‚Äù and then losing any bit of willpower and placing another order when the time comes. I know I can control my own actions, but I‚Äôm sure you guys know it is a battle at the start. Please help me to help myself quit!",6,0

but now its time to say goodbye to my burning ""friends"".  


I am a designer/artist and I used these smoking-breaks to get a clear head and rethink. I ll definitly have to make these breaks in future but not smoking.   
maybe somebody got some advice or something he did it in so usual situations.   
I think i ll just take my sketchbook with me and draw something.  
also the one in the morning in combination with a strong coffee will be difficult.  
and the beer.. omg.. the beer.   
and a lot of more situations where I always smoked.

I have lost money. I have burned the few relationships I had during this covid by being very socially distant and alone. Depression I could handle if I wasn‚Äôt a failure. 

I had a goal set 
2017 January Pick myself up - Failed
2018 Around July to quit smoking - Horribly Failed
Last year Dec 2019 - Enough is enough and that I would do the things that are overdue since 2017 
Covid March 2020 - Perfect setting for smoking. Smoking thrice the amount since then. 
June 2020 - dysfunctional environment and the events that took place that month that I couldn‚Äôt even think of quitting something so meagre as a cigarette 
July-August-September 2021- Next few months are going to be hell. My life‚Äôs situation is going on a downhill and there‚Äôs no way to stop. It can‚Äôt change. It can change if I miraculously follow on things that have been overdue for years. Life‚Äôs a fucking mess. I cannot change anything now probably. It‚Äôd be a miracle if I am alive next year this time because I‚Äôve been thinking of ending it all and the thing is I‚Äôm not even responsible for the things that I have to deal with for the next few months. It‚Äôs like getting kicked when you‚Äôre down. Then getting kicked even harder after that. And harder. It‚Äôs like what seemed depression to me a few years ago can have a comparison to peaches for the things that I am dealing with now.

Mistakes

I have made mistakes left and right in my life like I was designed to walk on mines every step of the way. If I tell you my story, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to help yourself but feel pity. And you would wish you didn‚Äôt hear what you just heard to be true. But it is. 

And

Cigarettes/Weed/Alcohol help me deal with nothing but it has surely been present and affected me all these years for the failure that I am today. 

Fun fact

It‚Äôs truly astonishing how bad your life can get from where you‚Äôre sitting right now. 

In the back of my mind I always have a thought, what if I was clean for a year, from everything. And even though my mind wants to know the other side I am unable to. I crave for a clean life. I‚Äôm crave being able to breathe. A long good breadth. Having a clear mind without all the haze.

I essentially started vaping the moment I was legally allowed to do so.

Ever since I started vaping, I was experiencing awful chest pain and shortness of breath. I'm asthmatic, and I saw my doctor several times about it, even took a trip to ER for fear of heart problems. Luckily my heart is fine and my lungs are as okay as an asthmatic's lungs can be. So life threatening stuff was off the table.

Still, I've suffered from severe anxiety since I was a child, and it didn't help said anxiety that my chest felt like a strongman was practicing his drum solo on it. I know now my chest pain has basically just been a mix of my asthma and anxiety fighting for dominance on who can make my day worse.

Even with all that, I still vaped, and I vaped a lot. No matter what I was doing, I usually had my vape in my hand. Hell, if I was a sleepwalker, I probably would've ended up being a sleepvaper. Nothing could stop me from turning my vape into a wannabe fog machine.

I've tried quitting in the past. The longest I lasted was a whole three days. I always told myself I needed to stop, which is true, but I never wanted to stop. I'm happy to say that's changed.

I've been working up to this day for about a month (at least I think it's been a month cause last I knew it was still 2020 for fuck's sake). I told myself it was my last bottle of ejuice, and I asked my ma to keep her bottles of out sight and out of mind. Filled up my last tank a couple of hours ago and I've just run out.

I want to quit, and I'm going to. I'm done living everyday feeling like I'm slowly suffocating. I needed to write all of this down and just put it out there for my sake. Wish me luck, or at the very least wish the people around me luck, cause I'm not going back, not even if it kills me (which of course it won't, quite the opposite really, but goddamn it's gonna feel like it).

Thanks, and see y'all on the nicotine free side soon.",3,0

I recently have been diagnosed with bladder cancer.  Last week I had a procedure to remove three tumors from my bladder.  Have smoked my whole life, with the exception of an approximate 4 year span that I quit straight up cold turkey about 15 years ago.  The trauma of my Father's death, as well as being around a ton of smokers while I was grieving basically caused my relapse.  Also, being a bit cocky knowing I ""just walked away"" from them before made me feel it was ok...

Well, years later, here I sit, still smoking, recovering from cancer surgery, and realizing it might not be so easy to quit this time around.  

I don't want any prescriptions, my doctor advises against it because it might interfere with my meds.  He had suggestions, BUT he was never a smoker, though I value his advice, I feel I might get better advice from actual smokers that have pulled it off.

I was thinking about something like nicotine lollipops, but I discovered to my astonishment, that they are not legal.  Seems odd to me, really are they not just lozenges on a stick? LOL!  Was maybe leaning toward the patch combined with lozenges or something like that.

My question is what methods have you found to be the least stressful?   I have a lot of anxiety nowadays, and am afraid NOT quitting might hurt my cancer recovery.   FYI I do not drink or do any drugs.  Enough people in my life have killed themselves with booze that I decided years ago that they drank enough for me, so I don't need any...

I was hoping that I would have some amazing surge of energy, feel youthful and energetic again, etc. But instead, it seems like every day around 2 or 3 pm I just CRASH, and I crash HARD. Could take a nap in my seat, sometimes feeling like I might nod off while driving. 

When I quit I was hoping for the opposite of this.

I've barely been drinking, stayed on my Wellbutrin, some edibles every once in a while, but nothing out of the ordinary compared to before I quit... I guess I have been a little erratic with my sleep patterns though. Maybe a bit dehydrated? But no extreme changes in lifestyle.

I hope to be nicotine free in about a week.  I smoked for about 25+ years and I agree the first few days were a bit rough and I got used to not smoking.  I can so easily stop wearing the patch but I just want to wean off ever so slowly that  barely notice.  I wanted the quit to be super comfortable and it absolutely was like floating on a cloud.  


I also started walking about 6 miles a day and doing some sit-ups.  I also fixed my diet so I only eat fruits and veggies during the day and all this helped me lose about 10 lbs of weight as well.    


My advise to anyone trying to quit is not to dwell on how hard it is and how everything sucks.  It doesn't have to be that way.  Just get out of the house, enjoy, get physically active.

Im still feeling so down about it and like I failed. I don't have a craving for a cigarette today but I'm just like nervous now and also I'm feeling like all my progress is gone. I'm thinking of all the health benefits and I feel like I erased them all. It totally sucks. Anyone have any tips for dealing with this? Or know if a few puffs erases all the health benefits of quitting for 5 months?",3,0

I basically used nicotine once an hour, about 16-20 doses per day.

What I did was cut my intake by 50% for one month. I did this by using the stop watch on my phone, and allowing one ""dose"" every hour, except that on every other hour I had to use a nicotine-free, herbal replacement instead of the real thing. Now you might think that a 50% drop is huge, but it turns out that I had 0 cravings at all. Even though you know the herbal replacement is bullshit, I think it provides a placebo to your mind.

I'm now on my second month, and I've cut again by 50%. So I have one real dose every 4 hours, following by 3 herbal doses on the other others. So each day I'm only using 4 real doses per day! I have no cravings at all, and I don't find it hard to cut back whatsoever. I will continue to cut by 50% each month until I'm down to 0. In fact I think I could probably just quit now but to be honest I'm trying to stretch it out as long as possible. 

My hypothesis here is that when you cut back instead of quit cold turkey, your body really doesn't have a chance to go through any kind of physical withdrawal. And if you use an herbal replacement to simulate the habit, you can trick your mind into not having any mental cravings. 

This is just my experience. It may be harder for you, or perhaps quitting cold turkey is better for you.",8,0

I graduate college in 3 weeks (Finally!) which is where I started smoking 12 years ago so I thought it would be a good milestone to quit for. I quit for about 3 weeks back in May 2021 and honestly was probably the best I have felt physically, mentally and emotionally since I was 18 before I started smoking. I had energy to play with my two young kids (1 & 5) every day, I was productive at work and around the house, and I just felt I had so much life and time back. Most of all I was not ashamed any more of being a smoker and was comfortable around my family again. 


Why am I quitting? Most importantly I want to be here for my kids as long as I can and knowingly killing my self with even puff is no long a decision I can support in myself. We also are trying to buy our first house by the end of the year so every dollar saved us going directly to that and other better things to spend money on like a gym membership to get in shape. 

I am using two stop smoking apps to help keep me updated on my health 

So with that in mind and off my chest here I go to this scary new world üåé!!! Any words of encouragement or advice are welcome.

I've considered that if I ever get the craving for a quick smoke at home, I just do a bit of working out. Maybe 10 pull ups, a few squats, do some curls etc.

The work smoke seems to be the hardest to figure out, because I'd probably smoke 8-9 cigarettes in a 10 hour shift. I simply have a slow enough job to allow it.

349,2021-07-17 15:10:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/omalq7/second_time_quitting/,Second Time Quitting," 

I created my account just for [r/stopsmoking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking) so I can share my story with others and treat this as a diary. Please ignore my bad English.

I started smoking at college and smoked for 5-6 years. I wasn't planning to quit the first time, it happened randomly.

I never told my mom I smoked and when she came to visit me (I work in another city) she stayed around 10 days and I did not smoke during that time. After that I just decided not to smoke and it lasted more than 4 years. I only smoked occasionally 1 or 2 cigarettes when going out with friends but I did not restart. My wife had quit after me and it was all going well.

After those 4 years I was out with my wife and friends. And we started smoking with them. Only if we did not bring a pack home. Once we finished it we bought another and another and before I knew it was part of our lives again.

This is my second time quitting. And again my mom is visiting :). I haven't smoked for 4 weeks. This time I was planning to quit so I was ready before she arrived. I didn't use wape, gum or nicotine patch. I just reduced before quitting and stopped suddenly.

Honestly speaking I enjoyed smoking very much. Reason I want to quit is that I started to feel its effects on my health. I started to feel pain in my throat, I can't run as much as I could etc. But after quitting I started to feel the benefits very quickly.

**Things I find helpful (at least for me)**

1. Choose a date in advance. It can be a work day so you are distracted or week end if you believe work adds too much stress during first days.
2. Try to smoke less in the meantime.
3. Make preparation before that date. Get rid of cigarettes, lighters, and ashtrays etc. So you can't take a quick puff. Relapses only happen in a short weakness. If you have to go out to buy cigarette you'll have plenty of time to stop yourself.
4. Clean the house (especially curtains if you smoke at home) and your clothes. That will help when your sense of smells comes back. You'll appreciate the clean smell. And smell of cigarettes will disturb you more quickly.
5. Try to exercise. It does not matter how hard you exercise just enough to sweat so nicotine leaves your body early. (This one may not be scientifically correct but I felt better)
6. Find some distractions. For me it was gaming and jogging. You won't remember smoking all the time. Just make sure you are busy when cravings hit.
7. Be ready for cravings, they will happen. I guess it is different for everyone but it can get very intense. You gave your body an addictive substance for a long time. It will take time to forget. Also it becomes a very strong habit in time. You'll be fighting both. Being ready for it helped me.
8. I believe it gets easier in time. Cravings get less frequent and less intense. One day you'll realise you don't even remember that you are trying to quit let alone you were once a smoker. Just remember that even one cigarette can take you back to square one. Don't risk it.

**What changed for me so far:**

1. My sense of smell did not change but everything tastes better now.
2. I started to eat more. I guess I'll have to go on a diet once I feel ready. I am planning to start my diet on August.
3. I was feeling a minor pain in my throat from time to time. It is gone now.
4. I feel better when I wake up.
5. My lungs feel stronger.
6. I'll go for a run tomorrow and see if there is any improvement.

It's been 8 days this time and I bought a game for myself as a gift with the money I saved not smoking.

Good luck to everyone trying to quit I'll try to update this post.",8,0
350,2021-07-17 14:51:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/oma8u9/alcohol_bars_and_socializing/,"Alcohol, bars, and socializing","It‚Äôs been 5 months since my last cigarette. Last night was my first night going downtown with friends since the pandemic began. (We are all vaccinated and my county has a very high vaccination rate)

I used to smoke cigarettes like crazy on a night out. Alcohol and cigarettes went hand in hand for me for so many years. I couldn‚Äôt even imagine drinking without smoking. Quitting seemed so impossible because I would have to give up two vices to do it. 

Going downtown to bars and clubs also meant lots of smoking. Even if I was trying to quit back then, a few drinks and easy accessibility to cigarettes lead me to waking up the next day with a new pack of cigarettes. The cycle just continued for so long. The pandemic definitely broke that cycle to a certain degree. I definitely wasn‚Äôt going downtown drinking and smoking, but I continued doing so from home to a much lesser degree. 

By the time I was finally able to call it quits, I was down to about 2 cigarettes a day. My fianc√© knew I was struggling to quit and just decided to take my pack of cigarettes and throw it away at his work. I‚Äôve thrown away packs at home and then dug them out of the trash can a day or two later. (That sounds so nasty now that I look back on it) He took them away on a snow day and the corner store was closed. I was craving so bad and ravaged the house looking for my cigarettes before he texted me and said they were gone. He then said our bed has began smelling like cigarettes, and I smelled like the dirty contractors he deals with everyday and I needed to quit. 

My interpretation of that was a shock to my system. Like, oh my god I smell bad and it is becoming unattractive. Everything with my addiction was always internal. I always thought that no one knew I was a smoker. Being told that I literally stink made me feel like there was no hiding it anymore. So I quit that day. Cold turkey. No nicotine gum or anything. It might sound wrong to say this, but it was surprisingly easy after that revelation I had. I put a decent amount of effort into my physical appearance and the thought of looking nice and smelling bad was just completely unacceptable in my mind. Like I was fraudulent. 

Last night was great fun. I‚Äôm definitely on the couch hung over as hell today. I am not coughing or stinking. I walked past plenty of people who were smoking and even spent a decent amount of time at a bar I would always chain smoke at. Only now in my hung over state do I realize that I didn‚Äôt even think about smoking last night. No drunk cravings. No desire to escape the social bar for some ‚Äúfresh air‚Äù

For the first time in my life, I feel like I have actually quit smoking, and cannot even fathom a situation where I would even want to smoke again. I just felt the need to share my story today. Also, my fianc√© is a wonderful person, and hopefully you all don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs terrible for basically telling me I stink lol. That comment from him essentially saved me.",17,2

Several times I thought to myself ‚Äúif I‚Äôm going to be miserable, I should just go back‚Äù

A couple things really helped me:

Chewing mints during those times I‚Äôd get cravings- something maybe about the sugar or just the act of popping something in my mouth helped me TREMENDOUSLY.

CBD-  I had a stash of some CBD flower (no THC), that I‚Äôd hit a couple times a month.  It gave me something to inhale, and it also calmed me down.  I used this sparingly.

Daily gratitude list-  l would physically write down each day I completed without nicotine (day 243) and thank myself for it, and why I was grateful.

Reading studies about nicotine‚Äôs effect on brain chemistry and its effect on dopamine production-  It takes about 4 months for your brain to really start to bounce back.  

There are illustrations online of the timeline for brain recovery after quitting that helped put it into perspective for me.

I was hanging out with my cousin and 5 other friends, ALL of them who are chain smokers. We were drinking , but the worst part is i feel like I consciously decided that i will smoke, i wasn't even drunk (had maybe two drinks before). I had that hopeless feeling that this urge will never go away and why even bother resisting it, so that's how I justified in my mind last night i think. In the last months I've had several times where i was close to smoking , but didn't end up doing it. I'm really disappointed that I caved yesterday and i feel like all the progress has gone down the drain. I thought that by now when I face these ""risky situations"" where others around me are smoking, that my mindset would have shifted or that at least i wouldn't have such strong cravings still...

And yes I've read Allen Carr's book and still, I do miss the cigarette and I have to admit that the first cig or two yesterday was deeply satisfying , the last few not so much though. Regardless, I really don't want to start smoking again.....anyone got any tips,  encouragement, advice?",14,0

Work has been super stressful lately. Marriage is on the rocks. Longevity of living arrangements is under close scrutiny. Always an excuse, always an excuse. Tomorrow, Over the weekend, Next Tuesday, After The Holiday. Someday I'm gonna quit, but someday somehow never comes. Everything in life is uncertain for me right now, and it's hard. The only certainty is the nagging feeling that I've gotta quit.

I had a conversation with a new but close friend. Gave her the same old excuses about my habit. She told me ""You should quit today. You can always say tomorrow, but there's no time like the present."" Of all the things people have said to try to persuade me, this hit closest. Think of your health, they said. Think of your family, they said. 4 rounds left.

 Maybe I'm a selfish asshole, but my family never considered MY feelings, that I might like smoking, tempting fate, or the fact that it's a surprisingly cost effective method to self medicate my ADHD, as I've had extreme difficulty finding the right provider to actually assign me something that WORKS. But in all of this, Time is the one thing I can't get back. I'm healthier than I have any right to be, considering all. For now. I'm thinking of the hard choices I'm going to have to make in the coming months, decisions on division of finance(no property thank god.) Personal living arrangements, increased cost trying to make it on my own. After the separation, I've still got plans to make the latter half of 2021 count for something, make it meaningful. 

3 rounds left. Not to mention Healthcare costs! I'm a mess. $7/day √ó 30days = $210.00/month I can be spending or even saving, that I won't miss because I've already been throwing it away. I have a prospective roommate, a mutual friend of V.(We'll call my initial friend V.)as it were. My half of rent would $380.00/mo. Factoring my current useless expenses, that's $170.00/mo. Fuck, that's cheap! How could I pass that up?! 

2 rounds left. We're getting close to the finish!  I'm taking a moment to format the post now for ease of reading, if you've indulged me thus far. Stick around if you'd be so kind.  As I near the end of my rant, I realize that V. Is right. Why NOT today? There is literally no better day to quit than today. Right now.

1 more round. This is it. The finale. Thank you for staying tuned. Made a snap story making it official to all my friends and coworkers. Day Zero starts now. Because there is NO time like the present.",18,0

They were in a bus, they didn't have any cigarettes left, so they scanned the room for someone who smokes to ask for one, 

they saw a girl, who looked good and was smoking.. they approached here, asked for a cigarette, but it was the last one she had, and she offered to share it, they agreed... once the girl opened her mouth it revealed the missing teeth and the yellow ones left, they described the spit landing in the corner of hir mouth, although they were disgusted,

They smoked the whole cigarette with her, they thought about the number of illnesses she might had, how many of them can be transmitted via saliva, but they smoked the whole cigarette.

I thought that was rock bottom, and i thought i was very far away from it.
Till a week ago.

 Before i tell you about the rock bottom situation, let me introduce you to my addictive personality and control issues..

I have binge eating disorder *an on and off one* and i found out recently that binging is not just for food, oh no binging doesn't discriminate..
And people with binge behavior having issues with control over anything, like caffeine and nicotine, so when i knew that i was like oh sweet, im not ruining my body by choice, i have a mental illness, let me smoke 2 packs in two hours.

And so i did, the next day i shared with my family what happened, we talked, and i promised to try to quit.. and so i did, in the house.

I work from home and have no friends so i don't go out a lot, i would make up excuses to go out once a day to smoke.. 

And that's being us to the rock bottom story we all have been waiting for..
I was in a taxi, and couldn't find any one who sells cigarettes open because it was early, so i scanned the taxi to see if the driver smokes, and here it is, the ash tray, used and filled with the sweet sweet grey burnt breathes, i asked him for a cigarette, and he gave me one, also gave me his lighter.
The lighter didn't work, so he offered to light it for me, i said yes.

He put the cigarette on his lips, hold on it tightly, tried the lighter and lit it for me.

I took it back, put it on my lips and took my first one in 4 days, the cigarette was wet, salty from his sweat, i smoked it while thinking about the illnesses he might have, i panicked at the idea of him having covid and how i might spread it to my whole family.. 

But i finished the whole cigarette, while he shared with me how he prefers weed, and if i wanted some weed we can go and get some now.. i was scared, paranoid and disgusted.. but i finished the whole cigarette.",1,1

1. I wake up and can actually smell the coffee.  Not only is all the morning congestion gone and so is my horrific, stale cigarette morning breath but, I finally realise how much cigarettes have stolen from me. 
2. Confidence. I always felt ‚Äúdirty‚Äù sucking on my cancer sticks. I admired how non smokers always looked like they are just glowing. Without blowing my own horn too much, just going to come right out and say... I‚ÄôM GLOWING!
3. My hair smells amazing ALL THE TIME
4. My motivation is up and procrastination is down. In short, I get shit done. 
5. Anxiety. What anxiety? Oh you mean the anxiety that cigarettes gave me? Gone. 
6. I used to use a cigarette as an escape form my kids. I‚Äôm not sure what I was escaping from
because hanging out with my kids is AWESOME. 
7. I seriously love running. My smoke free lungs currently carry me through a 10km run easily. Watch this space... half marathon here we come. 
8. Free time and lots of it. 
9. Pride, but the good kind. Making yourself proud is the best motivator. I haven‚Äôt felt proud of myself for something in a really long time. I‚Äôm proud of my self discipline which I came to believe never existed, I‚Äôm proud of every moment and temptation that I fought and said no to and I‚Äôm proud that every day I don‚Äôt smoke is another day that I didn‚Äôt break a promise to myself. 
10. Last but not least, freedom... and it‚Äôs nice, really REALLY nice. 

Although I‚Äôm not at a point yet where I can comfortably and confidently say I am officially a non smoker (I‚Äôm not sure when that feeling will kick in), but what I can say is that you have to give yourself just enough time to feel the things that makes this difficult journey totally worth it and then cling to them like you are holding on for dear life because technically you are.

Choose to smell the coffee, choose confidence, choose to feel good, choose your family, choose productivity, choose your health, choose to make yourself proud and choose freedom every damn day. We‚Äôve got this. :)",198,0

384,2021-07-16 09:36:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/olh089/sudden_massive_cravings/,Sudden Massive Cravings,"Hello,

I hope you are doing well and having a nice day. I quit vaping/smoking last year in May, so it has been a little over a year and 1 month that I quit vaping/smoking. Despite the fact that it has been a year, suddenly I have these strong urges to go back to vaping/smoking. I feel like I am days away from relapsing because I think about it all the time. Has anyone experienced anything like this? The urges I have make me feel like I quit yesterday.

As a little bit of background, I am diagnosed with OCD and I take SSRIs. My OCD got extremely bad when I first quit smoking and it was not nearly as bad when I did smoke. In fact, it was hardly noticeable, so I always associate smoking with a possible reduction in OCD symptoms. I am pretty convinced that my brain just functions better on nicotine due to the release of neurotransmitters that I may be lacking. Additionally, OCD can be pretty unbearable and I always tell myself that I'd rather smoke for the rest of my life (if it did reduce my symptoms) than have intrusive thoughts all day. Lastly, any time my intrusive thoughts get bad, I get really bad cravings to smoke, which further has me believing that nicotine would help me. 

I am doing pretty well these days in terms of OCD management (substantially better than last year), I exercise 4-5 times a week, and I meditate. I would say overall that I am doing well and feeling pretty good. My OCD has not really been acting up too much, but the cravings are still strong. My situation may be unique due to the OCD, but I thought it would be helpful to provide some background.",5,0

I didn't even need to be super drunk or anything, just after a couple of drinks and the cravings got so bad that I smoked. At the beginning i just smoked when I was drinking. And then it didn't take long for me to start full on smoking daily again.

I was a casual runner for the last 4 years maybe- casual being maybe 2-3 times a week, maybe 10 miles a week. Definitely not nothin', but certainly not really progressing beyond that, nor was I trying to. I was content to run like that week in and week out. I was smokin' a pack a day and I guess somehow took *pride?* in my running despite my other terrible habit. But it was a big reason why a total of 3 10+ minute miles was enough to tap out- I didn't have the cardiovascular potential to go longer or faster.

This second time around, I've really gone all in with running and am running 30-40 mile weeks, up to 150 miles a month. Long distances, getting faster all the time, and loving every second of it. I am happy to have something to commit to so fully and enjoy so much, something that is keeping me in a better state than before. This was inspired partly from my decision to quit drinkin' almost a year ago, after a long period of alcohol abuse. Running has been a really great side effect of each. I used running to help me get through a lot of those difficult days  in the initial weeks of sobriety and not-smoking, all of that anxious energy had to be spent somehow and it translates really well into something like running for 2 hours at a time.

I'm saying this not to pat myself on the back or to be Introspective Internet Guy, but because it didn't occur to me that this new level of running isn't just the product of having better lung capacity. Yes, that is a HUGE difference and my level wouldn't be possible if I was still doing it, booze or no booze, cigarettes would forever stand in the way of that. The point is that I have something that is not easy and is very challenging to give myself in place of something that was extremely easy and not at all challenging: smoking 20+ times a day for the temporary satisfaction of quelling an addiction temporarily. 

The difference between my first go-around and second is that this time I have something that I can really get excited about and challenge myself with, that I could not with cigarettes in my every day life. It's easy to enjoy the myriad of *super powers* unlocked when you knock off this terrible habit, the most enjoyable parts however I think translate directly into things that require a step 2. Step 2 for me was taking training more seriously, getting involved with the weirdo cult that is the running community (üòâ) and putting one foot in front of the other a lot. 

I'm sorry if this comes off as self-congratulatory- I'm struggling to find a way to explain this revelation in some way that doesn't come off as a really disingenuous humble-brag. Running is cool and I'm happy I fell into it. But the more important part is that now I have even more significant motivations to stay the fuck away from cigarettes and to not fall for the trick for a third time. 

Have any of you had the same experience? Something you realized you were really good at or really enjoyed doing after you quit? Or more specifically- any new-born runners after kicking the habit?",6,0

Be warned: Long and non-English native speaker


Most people and even a lot of people here on this sub think that stop smoking is pretty straightforward. You stay strong, crave for a month, and then it is over.


My story is a little bit different and maybe seems a little bit dark at the beginning. That is why a wanna start with science about stop smoking to put it in context. 


Suddenly stop smoking by sheer willpower and reading books (Allen Carr) has a success rate of 5%. 
The most successful way is behavioral therapy combined with nicotine substitutes has a success rate of still being non-smoker after one year of 30%. 
That seems pretty bad. And it is. Nicotine addiction is a very strong addiction. After one year of staying smoke-free, your brain should have mostly rewired positive and negative situations and feelings without smoking. (Source in German: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3o9lZ2zEy0)


I don't wanna discourage you! Quite the opposite! I think being brutally honest and showing the downsides of stop smoking, should make you better prepared to combat that addiction. I have a some unpopular opinions about smoking. You may disagree with them and that is fine. Maybe it helps someone else. Here is my story:


When did I stop?
3 years ago.


How much did I smoke?
20 cigs on a normal day, 30-40 on the weekends. 


How many years did I smoke?
10


Why did I stop?
I loved smoking. The social aspect, the smell, the good feeling, the coolness. What bothered me was the addiction. Putting life on hold. Staying in a nice hotel? Have to go outside to smoke. Relaxing in bed after sex? Nope, have to stand up. Flying? Horror. Exams or work that needs my attention for more than one hour? Madness.
In some strange way, it was good that I was a heavy smoker. As a ""social smoker"" that can stay clean for multiple days without any problems, I would never have stopped smoking. 


Have you tried before?
Yes. After reading Allen Carr I was highly motivated and stopped smoking for 3-4 days. Went on holiday with my Ex and she still smoked. I started again and was immediately back to one pack a day. 


What was different on the second try?
My Ex and I had booked a long trip and I did not wanna be a slave to cigarettes. This time she would support me and stop with me.


Did you use any aids?
No. My Ex was very supportive and I downloaded to app smoke-free to motivate me. No nicotine patches.


How did it go?
Not good. Day 1-4 I had bad cravings. Could not sleep, sweat like a pig, was very moody, got in a big fight with my Ex. Thankfully she was very supportive. I instantly realized, that I was more hungry than before. Instead of smoking I would eat carrots and go for a walk. Days 4-8 were better and the cravings were gone. Then I fell into a depression for 2-3 months and gained 10kg / 20 pounds. 


Wait what? Depression, weight gain, that sounds awful!
Yeah, I know. It does not have to be that bad for everyone. Here is where my personal opinions come into play. Again, it is ok to disagree with them and YMMV.


Opinion 1: After 3 days nicotine is out of your body, but that does not mean anything.
You maybe have already seen this claim on this subreddit. While it may be true, that nicotine is out of your body, that does not tell the whole story. Maybe the itchy feeling goes away. The bigger problem is the missing dopamine. Your body gives you dopamine every time you light a cig. Eating, orgasm, gambling, gaming, sport can also give us dopamine. But nothing is as easy as smoking. For your dopamine levels to go back to normal it takes months.


Opinion 2: Smoking for some is self-medication. Smoking helps a lot to regulate or to suppress emotional feelings. Be prepared to not have that emotion filter anymore when you stop smoking. Nervous at a party with new people? Having stress at work? Feeling empty and depressed? Relationship fights? Cigarettes seem to help in these situations. You have to learn to combat these without the aid. Besides the help from cigs is only short-lived. Long term it makes stuff worse. I used to work at a mental institution and was fascinated by how almost everyone smoked. A year later I read how mentally ill people recover better when they stop smoking (was that in Allen Carr's book?).


Opinion 3: one and two are the reason why therapy helps a lot. I did not go to therapy but I guess it would have helped me a lot.


Opinion 4: As a smoker, you waste energy and content yourself with little. Because you get these dopamine highs, you are not willing to put effort into meaningful stuff. You are less driven to achieve stuff. I did no sport, had a lazy job, and did not confront my problems or problems in my relationship.


Opinion 5: Smoking can take a toll on friendships and relationships
You may realize that the only thing you had in common with a friend was smoking. You may start suddenly not be content with your relationship. Maybe your partner is not ready or willing to change and will leave you. 


Opinion 6: You have to accept, that some parts of life are just not that great. A drive by a bakery that people line up every day outside to get lunch. Some of them smoke. And I get it. Waiting in line to get food just sucks. Waiting for a train sucks. Smoking a cig makes waiting in line better. 


Opinion 7: We don't say thank you or compliment ourselves for small things.
Does not matter at work or at home, we take a lot for granted. That makes it sometimes frustrating. I remember being very angry after doing dishes or laundry at home. I put all the hard work into this and no one seems to care (nobody could care, because I was alone). Normally I would give myself a pat on my back by taking a break and smoke. Now I just stood there feeling empty. 


Opinion 8: Smoking other stuff can be okay
I know that I would never become a cigar smoker. That is why I did not hesitate to smoke a cigar here and there. Did not like it and quit after 6-8 cigars. I would still recommend ""not a single puff"" when it comes to cigs.


Opinion 9: Go outside with other smokers. Taking a break is a good habit. That is why I joined my smoker colleagues. It is easier to stand outside and see them smoke than stay at the desk and envy them.


Opinion 10: Do not get drunk for the first 6 months. 


Opinion 11: There is a right time to stop smoking. Because it is so hard to stop, I was very lucky that I had 4 weeks' vacation after I stopped and my Ex was very supportive. I know this advice is dangerous, because then you postpone quitting for years. I don't know when the right moment is for you but in the middle of a crisis is probably not the best moment.

I have purchased my last pack of cigarettes this morning, sending me off into my overdraft and no doubt adding to my stress over this coming weekend.

This has been a familiar story for a couple of months, and before that I have been mentally kicking myself with each packet sending ¬£10.00 up in smoke. I'm probably very close to a pack a day. 

I lived with my parents until late last year and until then I had comfortably enough money that smoking wasn't an issue. Now with a mortgage, council tax, bills and more to pay this just isn't true any more.

It's terrible luck to not have ""one for the road"" (personal philosophy), so this morning I have purchased a packet I'm determined to make my very last. I've got a dinner tonight, and tomorrow's Friday... what better time to kiss a fond goodbye to an 8 year habit?

I'm kicking this. I hate to see my money drain away. I'm in my mid-twenties, and I hate to see my teeth just beginning to suffer and degrade. I've seen from my dad the problems that leads to. I hate being a slave to a substance that harms me, that upsets my mother and (surely!) irritates my partner.

There's no doubt that willpower is going to be challenging. I live alone, there's nobody around to distract me when the cravings kick in.

I tried to quit once before and it lasted 2 days before I became an asshole, grumpy and people and family were throwing cigarettes at me.

Fast forward 6 years. I am divorced and life is less stressful. I told myself a few years ago I would quit at 40. Well it's been w years and I kept pushing it off. Covid, divorce, family member passing away, Chang at work, if there was an excuse I used it everytime.

I met someone on a dating app and she changed my life around. She didn't date smokers but took a chance with me. We hit it off and have been a thing for a bit now. When I'm with her all desire for smoking goes away. I decided it was time, and I did it. I got her cheering me on. And family and friends. Life is good.

I will admit last week was hard. There was a period I felt like I was having a panic attack over a stressful situation. It was classic self sabotage. The addiction demon puts a thought in my head and uses it twists it and makes you believe that it's actually happening. A problem so preposterous that you start to doubt yourself. It does this to make you give in. Make it so you can't take it anymore. And say fuck it I'm lighting up or doing that drug or drink. . I had to get out a guitar and play to calm myself. It was bad real bad. It tried again over the weekend but it's power has been diminished, although it doesn't fool me for a second. The moment I let off my guard it will be back. Injecting thoughts so bad that I need to light up. I won't let it though.

I got the patch, some things to chew on and hold. Something my woman gave me to ward off the insolent beast. I'm going to do this. I'm on it, I got this. It's time. Week 1 is over and it's going to stay this way.

Have been smoking for about 5 months. It started weekends only then once a day and during the last month or so it was about 6-10 cigs a day and a pack a day on weekend days. Right now I'm 36 hours without Nicotine. I started taking Cravv after 24 hours. I bought Nicotine gum as a last resort but I don't want to use it because I heard stories of people getting hooked on it + some people say it drags the addiction and it makes things worse. I chatted with the Quitline in Canada and they highly advised me to try the gum as they also said the worst has passed now that I'm 36 hours nicotine free. My fear is that since I was able to handle a day and half without the substance, why should I re-introduce it into my body again? I have a feeling it's just gonna make things worse.

I live with my parents at the moment, so I didn't really cook often, also I wasn't interested in cooking either, but now I cut veggies before meals and it made me fall in love with cooking again (I loved cooking as a child, fell out of the hobby when I became a teenager). Baked a bread today and it tasted amazing.  


HOWEVER, coffee tastes absurd to me now. And I was a coffee ADDICT prior quitting. Perhaps it's because I always associated caffeine and cigarettes to be stress relievers. Which they were, for me at least (maybe as a placebo). Anyways, coffee has started to taste like shit, I tried forcing myself a couple times and experimented with it, at one point I thought I had contracted COVID 19 because of how uncanny the feeling was, but after buying my favorite vanilla latte from the fancy cafe today, I have come to the conclusion, I hate coffee. Which in hind sight is rather a good thing, since my caffeine intake has drastically dropped, and my sleep quality is \*chef's kiss\* so good. But I do miss drinking an entire kettle of coffee a day, and the relaxing after effect of sipping it, and reading a good book with a hot cup of jo on my bed side table.",4,1

I use a vape with nicotine to help with my cigarette cravings until I can ween off the vape, especially around my best friend. My friend and I hang out in his garage almost everyday, we would smoke weed and cigarettes there, so it's a place that really triggers me to smoke. I stopped smoking weed when im alone because now that I dont smoke cigarettes, the weed makes me anxious more easily. I only smoked weed when I was at his place because I was with a friend and I would smoke the vape after smoking weed as an effort to calm me down by mimicking a cigarette. On July 6th I had to get surgery in my mouth (gum graft). It is advised not to smoke/vape for a week or 2 after the surgery. The main offender being the sucking action that can dislodge the clot that heals the site.(even drinking through a straw isn't allowed). So I haven't smoked my vape at all since the 6th (almost a week). I feel like I'm truly smoke free now, I felt proud to stop smoking cigarettes especially now that it's been 5 months but i always felt like I was cheating by managing cravings with the vape. I feel nervous to go hang out at my friends house again due to the fact that I know I'm going to almost feel like I need to vape from the sheer amount of cigarettes he smokes and that I'll be tempted to smoke weed that will in turn make me feel like I need to vape after. Has anyone been in a similar position? I feel like I should just stop vaping completely now that I haven't for a week already but I feel like I might vape once I have the green light too.

If I am to be honest with you, I think the only reason I was able to quit nicotine and stay nicotine free for 1.5 years is because I stopped being sociable.

When I do go out, its not that bad really. I don't even ask my friends for a couple of puffs of vape (to be clear I used to both vape and smoke cigs a lot). 

When I miss nicotine I ussually just think about how much money Ive wasted and how expensive cigs and vape juices are at the momment. I also might watch a video on smoking effects on the body and that helps me.

Yesterday in 110 degree heat my A/C broke down.  It is impossible to get a HVAC tech over because they are very busy during such extreme weather.  The first thing that cones to my mind as an ex-smoker whenever there is a problem is to go smoke a cigarette and figure out what to do.  Luckily, I was able to go start troubleshooting the issue. I bought a new thermostat but that didn't help.  Disappointed, I tried to go to to bed. It was hot.  Instead of trying to solve my problems by smoking (or drinking) like I used to, I started thinking.  I temporarily addressed the issue yesterday by setting up a window unit so we could have cooling in one room.  Found out the earliest a technician would show was in 4 days :( I have small children at home so this was indeed a minor emergency.   


I then woke this morning - worried about the day ahead with thoughts of smoking.  It was already 85 degrees outside.  I chewed some Nicotine gum instead and got to work. I painstakingly watched a bunch of YouTube videos and did a series of tests to figure out a part that was possibly defective.     By now the temperature was in triple digits.  I then decided to drive over 40 miles to purchase the part and plugged it in and Voila, it worked!   Moral of the story is I am way more efficient at getting things done and definitely able to think more clearly as a non-smoker and I also did save about $300 the technician would have charged me!

Back in March this year when I was a pack a day smoker, my car broke down on a highway, I smoked a complete pack of 20 cigarettes in a span of 3 hours while I was  waiting for the tow truck guy.  That day alone I smoked 38 cigarettes. Back then  minor emergencies always meant chain smoking. Next day I felt like hell.

&#x200B;

 To those who are thinking of quitting smoking, I can say that some of life's problems don't go away!  Same problems, but we do much better at resolving it as non-smokers! Smoking never solves the problem you are facing, it just makes it worse.  If you do fix a problem as a smoker, you fixed it in spite of it rather than because of it. Smoking absolutely has no benefits!

I smoked regular cigs for very long time (20+ years). The past few years I switched over to vaping full time. I always hated the smell of cigarettes and I took to vaping like fish to water. The convenience of being able to vape anywhere and no smell has made me vape all day long. With cigs, it was always a thing to go out side and have a cig and wait a few hours for next one. With vaping I can take a few puffs all day long and all brand new associations on when to vape where with cigs, I felt like i could manage it a bit more and limit the number of cigs I had a day. 

Now Im vaping before bed and first thing in am. I think I am waking up early because my body needs nicotine. I read about the happening with someone, maybe a celebrity, and I said if I ever get to that point, I really need to stop. 

I've read Allan Carr before and was able to successfully quit for a few months with no withdrawals. I have screenshots of all the important points and his summary. I'm just wondering if anyone has been in a similar position or any tips on how to quit vaping.  I think I need to apply the same approach as before and get in the mindset that the vape is not helping me and it is just the illusion and slight withdrawal from nicotine that I get the pleasure from. 

I recently went through a break up and working from home so I am alone and just vaping all day to deal with my stress/sadness/loneliness. I am running and starting doing yoga but I keep buying bottles of nicotine when I want to quit. I have very little nicotine left and looking for a little encouragement to not buy more or any advice. 

Thanks in advance and so great to see so many of y'all smoke free and supportive of others! Def gives me confidence",10,0

I would have never been able to get this far (in day 7 right now) without you guys. 

As the withdrawal induced fog in my head is now slowly clearing up at the end of my first week I want to share a few things that might help others. 

I am 42, been a-pack-a-day smoker of  25 years, with many quit attempts in between lasting from a few months to two years at max (due to pregnancy and nursing; so it is a huge exception for me). 

My biggest problem is staying quit for more than three months. This is why this time I strategized for the long term but because of my many failed attempts I was so not ready to quit. 

Here is what I did to get started:

1)For the past four months, I read people's posts on here. I gathered what I consider will prove to be good advice from other quitters under a Google Keep page and will come back to these when I get to the ""oh maybe just one puff won't hurt"" phase, which starts for me at around the third month.  Kind of like Frederick the Mouse gathering words for the [gray days of winter](https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-book-news/article/83970-frederick-a-mouse-with-a-message.html).

I picked a day when I felt I was strong enough to do this. So without your guys' posts, I would have never quit. 

2) I had quit a billion times before, so I know that my challenge is staying quit.  I quit cold turkey and strategized for longer term.  However, if you are new to this, don't shy away from NRT, gums, lozenges, chantix and what not. I did cold-turkey because in my experience they all have been the same. 

I think every method has advantages, so they are all very legit (speaking from experience). Whatever you do, try to prepare for the later phases of ""just one puff won't hurt"" lie. The hard part actually starts when the hardest part is over. At least for me, this has been my curse. 

3) I am completing my first week (yes my first day quit was a Monday!) and I know many here by now are experts on nicotine receptors and addiction science but I have to say this: With every craving, the interval until the next craving is definitely prolonged; this is the science but also my experience so essentially every craving is a good thing. 

When pushing through (or easing into) these cravings, maybe remember this and enjoy that a bit if that doesn't sound convoluted or masochistic? 

I suggest treating all cravings even physical ones as mostly mental and deal with them as such (enjoy their presence because suffering is great (jk), distract yourself, or dive in to them through mindfulness, whatever works for you).

So anyway, this time my strategy is to prepare for the darker days ahead, I'll let you know how it goes. I have plans to post at 6 months and then once every year if I get there (year 1, year 2, ..year 30..etc).",14,0

Then I was listening to the CBQ method YouTube channel and the founder said you can want to quit but it‚Äôs not the same as committing to it. 

That was it- the missing piece the part that helped me stop drinking. I have wanted to quit for years but never really committed to it. Made the decision. She said ‚Äúthe desire will fade and it‚Äôs not enough on it‚Äôs own‚Äù. 

So I picked a date and am now working on identifying craving ‚Äúplans‚Äù for each type of trigger. I‚Äôm already feeling myself let go of the attachment emotionally. Listening to videos, Allen Carr, journaling like crazy, etc.

I was so hesitant because of all of the reported side effects but, when it came down to it, the side effects of smoking worried me more. With me, I do get irritable, and occasionally have bursts of anger, which is out of character for me. I used to get nausea too until I started always making sure I ate well before the tablet and had a big glass of water with it. The dreams, however, I found amazing. I love dreaming and Champix just added this whole extra level of intensity that made them feel a little dangerous and surreal, but to me.. that was really great cos it really engaged me. And I was also able to dip out then back into the same dream after waking, which I normally have trouble with. I know everyone is different and their chemical makeup means drugs work differently... but for me, Champix dreams are awesome.

 Vero Mango Chili lollipops. The chili gives a little burn upon breathing in, and after the chili, the mango tastes pretty good. Not terribly expensive, $4.99 for a pack of 45. Flea markets, international superstores have the best prices. But i did run into them at Target the other day

  The stick that comes from the mango chili lollipop. Yes, the stick. They are made like thick stirring staws, with two holes near an end where the swirls for the candy is made. They are made of plastic, so no chewing, but if toothpicks aren't hitting that inhaling spot, these will do the trick. You can hold it like a cigarette, suck on it and it will give you some air into your lungs, and you can block off those two holes to give you a difference in air inhalation. I found myself trying to ash this stick out the window the first day. Idk, i love these things and use them with some of the items below. 

 Listerine strips. Hard to find in stores, but my international grocery store has them. I place them as far back on the roof of my mouth as i can and when you take a deep breath, the cooling sensation hits your lungs. The strips are stronger than mints and work great with sucking on toothpicks or those plastic lollipop sticks i mentioned earlier. Supposedly can be harsh on your mouth if you use too many, so use mints sometimes instead. And mints are prefectly fine too! I have two different types. My breath is always a winter wonderland. No more ashtray mouth, for sure.

 Pocky. i use the chocolate ones with coffee since coffee and clove cigarettes were part of my morning ritual. Chocolate and coffee go together well, pocky is stick shaped and you can suck on the chocolate part.

 Sriracha peas.  Spicy, crunchy.  I like them more than Sunflower seeds, especially while driving.  Nothing to keep your hands busy with tho. Nvm, i think i just like these as a snack. 

 Sunflower seeds. Classic.  Lower calories, keeps your hands busy. I need the burn of mint or chili, so i only use when i am bored of the other items. 

 Wooden toothpicks with a non-pointy end. Use with mints, or alone for sucking on.  You can chew on them a little, which you should not do with the plastic sticks i mentioned above.  

 The sweet items like fruit gum, blow-pops, jolly ranchers did not work for me.  I think i'm gravitating towards the inhalation and burn sensation.  I have bought cinnamon sticks that i have not tried yet and think i would also try cough drops and warheads, but i am very content with the items above. 

 TLDR: Vero Chili Covered Mango lollipops for the spicy burn and lollipop stick. Pocky for the sweet. Listerine strips and toothpicks for the menthol-esque burn. Good luck, newbies. We got this!",7,0

Easier said than done. One of my colleagues, who hasn't smoked for 9 years, picked up the wonderful habit of chewing tobacco a year ago. So, yeah...not that simple.

I myself never really wanted to stop smoking, now I realized. I used to buy nicotine chewing-gums, mainly for the days when I'd have quite a few work-meetings and smoking breaks weren't going to be feasible. I'd often try reducing the number of cigarettes, yet still end up smoking 1 pack a day again after a while.

I have sinusitis and smoking always made it worse. If I caught cold, coughing would always follow that and at least once a year I'd have to be prescribed anti-biotics by the doc for infections, that weeks long coughing eventually caused. I used to envy my friends who were perfectly happy smoking 2/3 cigarettes per day. But I never had such control, discipline or luck.

One day, my wife suddenly asked why don't I try vaping. It was perfect evening and we were at a bookshop(plus caf√©) and I was potentially ruining her day by blowing smokes towards her. Maybe she was tired sitting at smoker's sections at restaurants and cafes with me. She encouraged me to try it and also suggested that I can always stop vaping if it wasn't enjoyable or effective enough. 30 minutes later, we were at the vape shop nearest to that caf√© and I was talking to the very nice & helpful sales guy. 

He was very clear on a few things, vaping would be just a tool for smoking-cessation. I could never hope for giving up smoking permanently if I kept smoking parallelly. And finally, most important part, it can take a person multiple years to be fully weaned off cigarettes.

It has been over 3.5 years. I have sneaked a cigarette or two at least a dozen times in the 1st or 2nd years. I'd get insane craving, smelling burning cigarettes next to me once in a while. However at the 3 year mark, I finally lost whatever craving I had for those things. Couple of weeks ago, I wanted to be sure, so stopped vaping or chewing-gums for 2 days and bought a pack of 20. Lit up one and it felts like I was inhaling fumes and coating my mouth and throat with bitter ash.

This wasn't written to advocate for vaping or nicotine-gums. I want to encourage people who has already stopped and failed multiple times or someone who still feels intense craving even after multiple years. I think there's a time factor attached to smoking-cessation. Also, addiction to smoking isn't always about nicotine addiction. 

Maybe we shouldn't lose sight of it. The struggle is real but the goal is certainly achievable.",9,1

However, and sorry for those if it seems like I've been spamming the same things over and over I promise that's not my intent, I'm suffering from the craziest thing.

Basically my head feels like there's something in the sinuses but not, I feel kinda foggy especially when I am moving back and forth like when I'm putting the dishes away or if I toss and turn in bed. Is this damage from nicotine?

I've been a smoker for 20 years. Early 2020, pre covid I decided to try vaping to replace cigarettes, and boy was I vaping my ass off. One day while on the freeway I got crazy light headed and thought I was going to faint. Thankfully nothing happened and I wrote it off as just some weird event. But then it happened again while I was in a grocery store, and again on the road etc etc.

I continued to vape for about 6 months afterwards while continuing to feel that odd feeling in my head. During this time I visited every doctor you could think of because I didn't know what the hell was causing me to become dizzy when I drive or when I walk into a large building like a grocery store. Every test I received came back normal aside from me needing vision therapy because my eyes weren't teaming together. 6 months of vision therapy and now my eyeballs work great and I was hoping this was the cure to my dizzy spells but it wasn't

Eventually I went back to cigarettes up until 3 weeks ago.  I already am starting to feel better but good god this weird foggy feeling just won't go away. My doctor believes it's all the different receptors in my body and my brain basically freaking out (my words not hers) whilst being damaged and trying to repair itself. 

Anyway I'm pretty damn sure that once this fogginess is gone then the dizziness will go away or at least be less exasperated.  Just trying to see if anyone else has found the same type of connection here. 

And if you're someone who has read a similar post of mine in this regard the thanks again for reading. I'm just posting again because I'm becoming incredibly worried about what's going to happen to me (yes I'm aware quitting cold turkey after so long of smoking does cause anxiety and even panic attacks) 

I guess that sums up the bullet points of my concerns. If anyone knows anything about this kinda stuff or has experienced this please let me know I'm not crazy and it'll get better. I've been dealing with this for a year and a half and I'm losing my mind, my money and even my job. I just need help please.

I think it was a change in mindset, and I hate that phrase 'change your mindset' because it's such a buzzword-esque thing to say, but what I mean is I started researching how nicotine works on a BIOLOGICAL level, how it causes dopamine to be released, how your brain adjusts and dials down it's sensitivity to nicotine AND dopamine overtime due to the flood of these chemicals whenever you light up, which means with less dopamine sensitivity you don't enjoy day to day life itself, people, friends, adventure, experiences etc as much anymore, you only enjoy your brief little cigarette moments. But, this can be reversed.... by quitting, you will actually enjoy life MORE if you quit smoking because you ENJOY life, so if you're life is a basket, cigarettes take up half the space and provide mild (awful really) enjoyment.... but don't provide anything else. But if you take smoking out of your basket and make room for other things, you can try going to the gym where NOT ONLY do you get dopamine and enjoy yourself (just like cigarettes), but you get physical health, confidence, maybe meet some people, self-esteem.... Travelling you get dopamine/happiness, amazing memories, changes your world view.

Basically cigarettes are just trash and a waste, they provide minimal (and often negative in the long run) enjoyment when you could be doing things which add so much more value to your life... AND WHEN YOU QUIT SMOKING, DOING THOSE THINGS WILL BE EASIER AND MORE ENJOYABLE BECAUSE YOUR BRAIN WILL RE-NORMALISE YOUR DOPAMINE TO REGULAR NON-SMOKER LEVELS.

These have just been some really important realisations for me as someone who is really struggling with my MH, and feeling pretty far from what I want my life to be and ALSO wants to quit smoking.

So yeah, that's my lil message, just patting myself on the back basically, I feel like this is the time where I finally did it, because I know for a FACT that the grass is greener on the otherside, there are countless studies.

That's me, thanks for reading",73,0

For example, when you're a smoker and you may not wanna quit at the time, a cigarette seems very appealing. But I'm at a point where seeing cigarettes, let alone seeing someone smoke along with the smell of it actively grosses me out. I see that as an accomplishment.

\-When you quit, you need to realize that there is NO benefit to smoking. None whatsoever. It's not good for your health or your wallet.

\-You have to want to quit. You shouldn't quit just because it's expected of you but you need to be in the mindset of ""I am a non smoker"" or ""I don't smoke"" as opposed to ""I gave up smoking"" or ""I miss smoking"" as those mindsets will more likely make you go back to it. You have to see it as ""breaking free"" from something that no longer controls your life.

\-Emphasize how expensive they are and that they're a waste of money. You'll get to a point where you're like man, I can't believe how much money I wasted on those things.

\-Any time you may have ""needed"" a cigarette, you're truly just looking to relieve nicotine withdrawl. Someone who's never smoked is gonna crave or need a cigarette.

I've quit smoking 3 times over the last 20 years, once was for a year.  I've read Allen Carrs book about 5 times, I've tried vaping, I've tried the patch, Wellbutrin, chantix, etc.  

Smoking for me is like looking at my phone when I'm in a socially awkward situation.  If I'm hanging out with people, I smoke as I feel it gives me some sort of thing that not only I'm doing with my hands, but I'm occupied as well.  I always tell people that don't smoke, its like walking outside at a bar and just standing there...people look at you like, hmmmm what's this guy doing?  Just standing out here by himself having a drink. But if I'm smoking I'm doing something.  

The other thing, and I sort of cringe saying this, but I'm a creative dude.  I make music for some what of a profession..it's very serious for me and a huge part of my identity.  I love nothing more than coming home from work and pulling my keyboard out to work on stuff. It's hand and hand, if I'm not smoking while I'm working I feel completely in authentic... Like I'm not in the experience.  Some part of me has attached the act of writing, composing, being creative with smoking.  When I've quit in the past, even after 6 months I feel so separated as an artist.  

I want to be free of this trashy part of my existence.  I'm so embarrassed by it. I hide it from a lot of people in my life, as I think most people think I'm a pretty healthy guy.  Not to mention, my girlfriend is concerned about me smoking as she's a trauma nurse and deals with people that have ruined their bodies with cigarettes every day. 

I've signed up for hypnosis next week.  I'm desperate.  I feel completely powerless from smoking, where I know if I quit, I will feel like I'm in this sort of existence of myself that I can't relate to. I have friends that are so repulsed by cigarettes I avoid hanging out with them to not be judged/let them down. I have another group of friends that smoke and we all just sort of enable each other.  Ironically, we all talk about how much we want to quit smoking when we're hanging out.  

My great big question is, I'd love to learn how to disassociate myself from thinking smoking is embedded in any of my existence as a creative person. How do I do what allen carr so eloquently talks about not feeling deprived?  Has anyone ever been in a similar situation where their identity feels so intensely tied to smoking?  Has anyone ever convinced themselves that you can move past this nasty thing and came out on the other side?  My aunt has been quit for about 30 years and she's the first to tell me that she still thinks about having a cigarette.  That's so hard for me to hear as I'm afraid I don't have the willpower to walk away.  Any help, words of wisdom would be appreciated.",2,0

It's driving me mad. And there's literally nothing that can take my mind off it. I remind, convince, coax, scream in my head about the stupidity of it all.. To no avail.

I put the cigarettes in the window sill.

But declaring you are quit is one thing, staying quit is another.  Or is it ?  The way I think about it now, if you don't have a lit cigarette in your hand at this exact moment, you are already quit, that's what I understand now when I look back on it.  You have already had your last cigarette.  The only question is, ... now what ?  For me that now what became a frantic scramble for information about how to stay quit from that moment forward, and establishing coping mechanisms.

I don't remember now because it has been a long time ago, but I know it involved a lot of sleeping and misery for about 48 hours, lots of skittles candy which seemed to take the edge off, and trying to get my mind into a good place to stay quit.  That, of course, was the hard part.

What I do vividly remember settling into was that instead of trying to manage how I felt, with the understanding that eventually I would be okay if I could just make it from ""now"" until ""then"", ... I decided to ignore any approach that tried to keep me away from triggers, tried to help me to manage the suffering, etc, and to just simplify it all down to its most simple core.  And that core was that I could never put a lit cigarette in my mouth and smoke it again, ever.

So that's how I worked it ... I didn't avoid friends who smoked, I didn't take the pack of cigarettes out of the window sill, I didn't try to manage how I felt with nicotine replacement, and most of all and this is important - I didn't try to manage triggers in any way, or try to manage my own thinking so that I could trick myself into not smoking again.  I just didn't believe it would work for me, because I intuitively felt (and I was right, I think) that the addiction would win if I tried to play mind games, that it was smarter than me, and that I had to keep it super simple.

I just accepted that it was going to suck and that there was nothing I could do about it but to try to put as much time between me and my last cigarette as possible, and that I only needed one rule - never put a lit cigarette in my mouth and take a drag on it.  That was all.  Because I couldn't control how I felt, or who smoked around me, and I certainly couldn't control my craving and desire to smoke .. or the addiction in my mind constantly wanting to start a negotiation, ... all I could do is control my fingers and my hand so that I did not pick up a cigarette, put flame to it, and take a drag of smoke.  I know it sounds dumb, it felt dumb at the time, .. but that's how I proceeded, ... don't put a lit cigarette into your mouth and take a drag on it, that was the only rule, and in retrospect it was the only rule I ever needed.

And it did suck for a while.  First for a week or two, I remember being totally miserable the first 48 or 72 hours, physically, and then for the first few weeks it was a struggle mentally.  But I was already feeling a little bit better.  Then after that I started having hours at a time where I didn't think that much about cigarettes, and after about 2 months I would have the occasional day where I didn't think about it for most of the day.  But the magic for me was around the 4 to 6 month mark, where it got to the point that I basically didn't want to smoke anymore.  Sure, you'd walk into a grocery store and someone is smoking near the entrance and it smelled like heaven when I walked past, ... but it didn't make me crave a cigarette anymore.  It literally was like I was always a non-smoker, and at that point I felt like I had won.

And I basically had won.

The remnants of the addiction are whatever damage I may have done to my lungs, which is unknowable, but I can say I don't get respiratory illnesses anymore and the constant chest colds are a distant memory.  My voice is probably a bit more raspy than it otherwise would have been.  I do still very occasionally have dreams that I started smoking again and wake up with a sense of relief that it was only a dream.  And then there is a confidence boost that has never gone away of having beat it.

In conclusion, concepts that worked for me

* Just let it go.  Once you let it go and really accept the fact that you will never smoke again that disarms the trickers in your mind, that's the one thing they can't negotiate with, .. and it is all a lot easier once you accept that.
* Related, ... it's just a matter of time.  Yes, it sucks to quit, but it doesn't suck forever, .. you can get through it, you can (I promise) get to a point where you don't want to smoke anymore, you can do that, and it is simply about passing time, putting as much distance between you and your last cigarette as possible.
* Just don't put a lit cigarette in your mouth.  Let it suck, let the triggers happen, let your mind play tricks on you, let the voice of addiction in your mind play its games and make its offers, let the tears flow, let the doubts enter, ... just let go, let it happen, .. and just don't put a lit cigarette into your mouth.  These thoughts are not you, and they will subside the more time you put between you and your last cigarette.

Cold turkey worked for me, I can't say it works for others because I only have experience doing it one way, one time, and only with myself.  I believe there are other approaches that can work because I have met other people who quit in a different way, I am only talking about my experience and what worked for me.

Quitting smoking, it turns out, is easier than losing weight in my experience, .. because you can just put the cigarettes down and never smoke again.  The same cannot be said of food.

You've already quit, the last cigarette you had, that was the last one unless you choose to light another one.  That voice inside your head, it says ""let's just have one last cigarette and then we can quit tomorrow"", ... it is always negotiating for one more.  But ironically it is the very act of just accepting that the one you already had was your last one that can be a path to freedom, because it is an admission to ourselves that one more is the problem, not part of the solution.

I never touched the pack of cigarettes I put in the window sill.  Someone must have eventually threw them away.

TL;DR Stop smoking.

I've always had pot everywhere around me, and I still do since my family is composed of potheads.

The mixing has progressed to what we called ""domes"", where you mix everything up and rip it in one hit. The explanation will make sense in a sec. 

I've done this for about 4 years now, and I've smoked pot alone for a couple years longer. I smoke cigarettes at work, but no matter what I do. I always take a dome. 

Whether it's before work or before errands, anything that takes brainpower is superceded by a dome. 

Mixing pot and tobacco, in my experiences thus far, make it really difficult to quit just one or the other. I can smoke cigs all day, but it's always missing something. 

It seems minor, but I'm really struggling to break the cycle. And I feel even worse that I'm struggling like this and I'm only 4 years into the issue. 

Has anyone done and/or overcome something similar?

 I always search up stuff on how to stop smoking, but can never find anything on spliffs, let alone ""domes"".

I've had major GERD and esophagitis issues and felt a HUGELY remarkable difference in those symptoms already. I can't remember the last time I've felt this good and know that I still have a lot of room to feel even better.

If I'm in a situation where I know I can't go to the bathroom, I'm able to hold it. But if I KNOW that I'll be near a bathroom, I just have to go. Does this make sense coming from my crazy brain?

Similarly, if I know I can't smoke, I just don't feel as much like I have to. If I'm away with the wife's family or with my own, or if I'm with customers/clients, then my brain just doesn't go there as much. But, my problem and recent relapse as revolved around smoking before and after a job. 

My main line of work revolves around performing at various social events like fundraisers, galas, weddings, etc. And when I relapsed, I mainly started smoking again after a job as a way to decompress. It started with a cigar after a job. Which turned into cigars on the weekends. Which turned into Black and Milds during the week. Which turned into Black and Milds driving to and from jobs. Which of course, turned into cigarettes before and after jobs (and then of course, me wanting to do it during the week as well). Basically, I'd just smoke a lot before jobs, which got me super relaxed and also alert to do what I needed to do that day. In my brain, I'd tell myself I was getting nicotined up, or loading myself up to be ready for an event. And then of course, I would smoke back at the hotel since no one was peering over my shoulder. But as we all know, the next day, or next couple days, would be absolute hell as I have to recalibrate myself again.

So, I've been in a period the past couple weeks where I'm not as busy with work. It's been difficult not smoking, but I know it will be MOST difficult during these 2-3 hour drives to jobs, which are coming up soon for me. Has anyone else has to deal with this? I know the answer is to just ""not smoke"", but I'm mostly working towards training myself to not feel like I have to do that when working. Anyone have experience with learning not to smoke in these types of situations?

I went years without having to do this, but was always super anxious prior to events, which is partially what caused me to relapse. Obviously the answer is to really figure out how to get over this kind of performance anxiety, but my addict brain always just says ""It's so much easier to just smoke and be ready for the day.""",2,0

Last year unfortunately I picked up smoking again and this time I wanna quit for good. I've just put my last cigarette down and set my quit date. I've been wanting to quit for the last couple of months but there's this pattern that keeps me going back to smoking: being not busy with something and feeling even a tiny bit of boredom triggers it.

I'm a freelancer, so I'm spending most of my time at home in front of the computer and it's not really that easy to distract yourself or saying no to cigarettes when you know you can just go to the balcony (that's where I was smoking) and have one.

I'm aware of that smoking doesn't help with anything and I feel like I need a change in my life to drop it for good. So I thought maybe we could have this support group and if we're having a craving we would text each other and help each other mentally. I also thought we could play video games, just voice chat, watch some stuff on YouTube together, play chess or backgammon or that kinda stuff. I'm open to any ideas. If you just quitted like me, feel free to send me a message. We can have group chats and stuff if you guys would like that too. Let me know what you think. We got this.

I feel better meditating myself to sleep, than I did when I was vaping, because when I‚Äôd meditate as a smoker, all I could think about is when the fuck I can open my eyes to take a drag.

Anyways last night there was a party. I‚Äôve known about this party for weeks so I knew I had to go regardless of me stopping. 

Once I got there everybody was drinking and doing lines. I partaked in both however refused to hit any form of nicotine. I told no one I quit. Every time I had a urge I would reach for the juul I left in my pocket and just felt it, feeling more secure in knowing I have one on me despite having no intention on hitting it.

Waking up after, I honestly did not feel like shit. I normally would have but nope. I felt fine. 

I did not think I had the strength to put myself in a setting like that without smoking however I did !!! I enjoyed my drink more and I didn‚Äôt have that nasty cough the vape would give me.

I feel like I‚Äôm integrating myself as a non smoker back into society by not hiding from those that do. I just got to keep busy.

I do have less energy, I do have a headache, but hey I‚Äôm going on day 5 of no nicotine ! It only gets better from here. If I could survive last night , I could survive any!",7,0

Day 2 of no nicotine and the whole period was one long craving. When I woke up the next day it felt like the cloud had parted in my mind.

We talked about him some day quitting but he never actually did anything about it. In late 2019, he said he'll start trying in 2020 but that's when the pandemic hit hard where we are, and he got so paranoid and stressed about it that he kept smoking. I've always said that I'll help him in any way and I mean it, but I also don't want to force him if he's not ready. Since he's been so stressed, I just let him keep smoking as I know that's the way he relieves stress. He's really good about it too like always washes his face and uses mouthwash/brushes his teeth whenever he comes back into the apartment after having a smoke. I'm hoping once we get our second dose of vaccine he'll relax a bit. I won't lie, I'm getting a little tired of hearing ""I'm just not ready"" because...well, you'll always be not ready! There's never going to be a good time. We work in the same place and the company we work for even has an incentive for employees to quit smoking, and yet that's still not enough for him to do it. What can I do to give him a little kick to do it without being forceful?  


Edit: This sparked a bit of a debate so I should mention that I'm simply wondering if there are people out there in a similar situation as me, or they were in one, and what their experiences are. Did you used to smoke and successfully quit? Did your partner help you? How did they help you? I should've included that in the original post so I'm sorry if it caused some confusion.",3,2

I started smoking as a 12 year old, not long after a chain smoking parent moved out - since then, it took me 21 years to fully kick the habit. 

As a future ex smoker, take a second and think about how that feeling is more than likely anxiety.

After 3 years of being a non-smoker, I still get these moments where I experience what feels like a craving for a cigarette but I‚Äôve since come to realise that the physical feeling that I have come to associate with a craving - is really just different levels of anxiety/stress. 

Going forward, I suggest you acknowledge what you are feeling and start off with some breathing exercises. Over time, it‚Äôs entirely possible to distance these 2 things (craving/anxiety) - For me, the moment I was able to retrain my brain to not think of a cigarette as the solution but rather that I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed, all future ‚Äúcravings‚Äù became a teachable moment about myself, for myself.

Other things made me happy.

It's bipolar that does it and don't say nicotine . makes bipolar worse or give me some bullshit study. A study isn't me!!! It is so weird how while I have cigs or my vape I am a perfectly happy person.

Without any of it I am an angry depressed asshole who allll of a sudden moods change and I would rather die than do 1 more day. Don't say well you'll die with cigs...I'm gonna die early anyway keeping this up!!! Usually people with bipolar disorder die anywhere between 9-22 years earlier.

I feel like I would rather want a lobotomy right now than go through 1 more day! My skin is crawling..

Maybe it's a mixed episode..well dangerous things can happen during that and if vaping helps me not go off the deep end. I'm gonna do it.

Before I quit with my meds I had a day a month or so but not miserable and depressed and angry everyday. Sorry. Not risking stability and NOT changing meds or have you ever been on some of those meds?

They can't just give a bipolar Lexapro or Xanax or ability.. it's a combo for a lot of us...and some of them well most of them for bipolar feels like a constant stupor for me. I mean memory problems all of a sudden. Short term memory loss problems

It's just that I have been extremely irritable and have been in more fights with my girlfriend during these two weeks than in the 10 months we've been together.
The smallest things, that were perceived as jokes or normal communication before, are taken as insults and trash talk. So I trash talk back. I've never acted like this towards her before.

Also, I've been using alcohol as a method of coping with non-smoking, and getting drunk makes me even more irritable, not cheerful and funny as it was before.
I feel like all problems I have with myself and my personality are showing more and more and I am taking it out on my girlfriend. She's putting up with it, and really happy for me quitting, but I cant bear being out of control of my behavior towards her. I just hope that things will go back to normal ASAP. Yesterday night I really embarrased her in public. I will not drink until I feel that I am OK with myself regarding the smoking crisis.

I've seen some posts here from people that have quit that seem to make smoking as something they still long for. I kind of do that too sometimes for brief moments, but as I've gone through the year and finally seem to have ""gotten it"" through many failed attempts through the years, I also remember how hard it was to start the last time. It got easier of course but the start was always very hard.

I took my last cig the night before cold turkey. (I'm a pack a day kinda guy) I'm doing this not to just save myself, but my future kids, and my future grandkids. If I would like to create generational wealth to save them from financial struggle, I need to live as long as I could. To do that, need to stop taking the most toxic thing first. 

So, here's my experience...

Week 1

Started feeling my eyes was twitching but still bearable. But a bit concern could it be the side effect of the vaccine. And then my stomach started aching and bloating. Went to the doctor, he said I had gasthritis and gave me some medication. Thinking it could be the last bottle of coke I took the same night I stop smoking. (Stopped taking sugary drinks as well)

Week 2

Feeling breathlessness. Sometimes felt like heart was racing. At one point I thought my heart stopped, however, I didn't die. So went to the doctor again, checked my O2 level was normal. Did ECG, my heart beat was normal. He suspect I had a panic attack due to anxiety. Was shocked as I've never had any anxiety issue before. Was in denial for a while, but since the doc said it, I can't argue much. But the panic attack lessen since the results of the test made me feel content it's just my mind playing tricks with me. Cause everything else is normal.

Week 3

Still twitching and feeling a bit of bloatedness. Lightheadedness started appearing. After reading a lot of medical symptoms online the past 2 weeks to figure out what's going on with me, I came across smoking withdrawal article which mention one of the symptom is twitching. (Which I did not see in any other suspected issues that mention twitching during my research on what am I actually experiencing the last 2 weeks). That's when I realise, shit, this is not the vaccine issue. This is a nicotine withdrawal issue. Lol.

Week 4

The bloatedness got worse. So had to go to the doctor again to refill my medication. This time I mentioned to them I quit smoking the night before the vaccination and explained again everything that I experience. She said everything is normal and it's part of the withdrawal experience. (Told her I didnt mention before, cause it didnt come across my mind it was the ciggarette. Never had a single urge to buy a pack when I dicided not to smoke anymore).

But since now I know it's the nicotine withdrawal, it makes it easier to not think of another ciggarette anymore. Cause I don't want to go through this crappy experience again. On day 36 now, lightheadedness got worse, body tremors from time to time, especially at night, itchiness here and there, muscle aches and started coughing dry cough. (All this the for the past 3 days).

I psycho myself during every experience of the withdrawal telling my innerself that this is part of the healing process. So, far it's been helping. 

But if this experience was the highway to hell, I'm sure as hell stuck in traffic. 

Didn't know 5 years of smoking could make such an intense experience. I thought this kind of feeling would only happen if I smoke beyond 10 years and smoke like 2-3 packs a day. I know better now, that's not how it works. 

All in all, good life experience. üëåüèº Still going strong. It's easier when you have a really good reason to quit. Especially when you are young. (Cause we tend to be carefree and living life as it is.)",24,3

I had quit smoking for 13 days and was using the patch, and then following some stressful events, a craving came over me that was like some kind of crazy death grip.  I put up no fight... just went straight to buy a pack.  It felt like being blindsided.  

I smoked for 2 days, and I just put out my last smoke.

I've been a heavy smoker for 22 years (started at 15), and never ever thought I would be willing to or able to quit until getting some crappy health consequences from it, verified about a month ago now.  

Part of me still can't imagine life as a non-smoker, but I just did it for 13 days so there's no reason I can't do it again.

I haven't interacted a lot, but reading you the first days/weeks when I stopped, surely helped me a lot to achieve this important milestone ! 

I was smoking a pack (20 cigs) a day, and I was so afraid to stop. I had thoughts like ""what am I going to do? it is so much stress relieving"" or ""I am going to feel so much like shit, the cravings will make me fail anyway"". But, reading you made me realized how much those thoughts were bullshit and that I was able to stop. So I did ! I even did it cold turkey, since I really wanted to cut the addiction and not delay it. Yes, I did felt like shit for a couple of days, even a week. I even had to continue my habit to go outside, changing smoking by drinking some water. But the feeling after when you are free from this smoke and nicotine prison, it is just so good !

I took some time tonight to reflect on that past year. Yes, I still do have some cravings sometimes, and I smoke one from time to time in my dreams, and god they are good ! But, I never want to back to smoking again. Seeing how good I am, how well I am breathing, how better I am smelling, stopping was the best decision I have ever made. 

It's a mountain to climb, but when you are on top, goddamn then view is beautiful!

So me and my boyfriend stopped again and now that I am on day 4 it really gets easier. The second day was tough but I feel like now that I am just living my normal life it should be fine. 
I am just really scared about going out for drinks because I love having a beer and a cigarette together and the psychological addiction just hits me and it becomes sooo tough to stay strong. Also I am going on a vacation soon, on a boat trip with other smokers. I can already imagine myself enjoying the sunset while smoking a cigarette.
It's so twisted, I don't want to smoke anymore, but I kind of feel like giving up on cigarettes in these situations is also something I don't really want to do, I just know that its necessary to be successful.
