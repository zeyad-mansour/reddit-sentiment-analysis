I meant to quit New Years but got snowed in and ran  out of cigarettes dec 26. My therapist had already pointed out to me I use cigarettes to cope with being triggered. I was surprised, I thought everyone did and hadn't given it thought. Today I had a new aide who brought several bags and I a) felt trapped in my small small apt b) she made a very loud noise accidentally and I startled so hard I hurt my chest and c) She opened my apt door when I was searching for my key to let her in downstairs. I knew it was her, but I have both PTSD AND Cerebral Palsy which causes uncontrollable startle reflex. So yeah, I'm triggered and grumpy and frustrated. I found some lozenges but I just ... it's not like I have a choice. I have a gum graft in late january. nicotine lozenges is acceptable but discouraged. I am slowly learning grounding and centering techniques but what I MISS is taking ten minutes outside to consume something through breathing, that impacted my body and mind instantly. I miss the ten minutes being a transition from either stressful event or a signal that the trigger can be over. That I'm safe. What sort of grounding technique provides the same reward as smoking? I hate deep breathing, its not helpful. Probably because I have sinus issues.  I just need something that will provide dopamine or oxytocin or something. That's not pot bc I can only do that before bed. UGH. Today was the first day I lost my cool about it all. Because it's not fair that someone who was traumatized so recently be asked to quit so soon.

Smoking cigarettes wasn't very frequent starting out, I only really smoked a cigarette a day when I could get away with it. Eventually after a year or so, I started smoking more and I noticed a massive difference in my wellbeing, mental and physical. I felt like I ruined my entire life by starting at all. Still feel like I have to this day. My breathing was terrible, and it didnt help I had pretty significant asthma to begin with. These days, I rely on my asthma inhaler almost every day. When I wake up, I'm literally wheezing and struggling to get a breath of air until I take my inhaler. It didnt used to be this bad. I smoke up to three packs a day because I'm so highly addicted and when I go cold turkey, whether its out of lack of money, or on purpose, I get highly agitated and stressed. I want to quit in the long run for sure, but I can't do it cold turkey. I have a vape with 25mg/ml salts, but it doesn't satisfy my cigarette cravings at all. It does help me go a little longer without a cigarette, but the second I get cigarettes, the vape doesn't help me much. Right now, what I'd like to do is at least slow down on smoking until I can get to a point where I can quit and am ready to. What would be nice is to get down to one pack a day or less, but I'm having a lot of trouble. Any advice or recommendations would be great, I'm very desperate right now. Thank you in advance.",4

100 days! How good.

Some thoughts for the person at 0 days contemplating the road ahead:

\- As most folks will tell you, the first week is tough. If you can get through 7 days, in my experience, you can probably get even further. The trick I found is to keep yourself distracted with tasks that keep your hands and mind busy. 

\- You don't have to jump directly off of the top step. My successful quits have always gone from cigarette, to vape, and then quit entirely. This is because you can choose the nicotine strength of your vape's e-liquid, and so you can switch from cigarettes which are very high nicotine to a vape with a modest 6mg nicotine juice, drop it to a lower 3mg after a month, drop it to a very low 1.5mg after another month, and then quit altogether. Psychologically for me this is helpful because I know I am jumping off a lower step and there's less whiplash involved.

\- When you quit, it's okay to replace the vice with something like candy or snacks - but ONLY temporarily. I remember on day one of my quit just sitting around playing Xbox and just tearing through a package of those Hi-Chew candies because they tasted fruity like vape juice and filled that expectation of flavor. Whenever a nicotine craving would hit I'd just devour a few of the chews and push through. That said, if you do this for a long time you'll get diabetes which is also not fun so just remember this is a temporary bridge out from a bad place and should be treated as such.

\- I don't know if this is a tip or what, but my caffeine intake went way up. Guessing this is because it's also a stimulant that makes your brain light up. If you can feel your brain craving a hit of nicotine, try giving it a Bang or something. 

\- Tell the people in your life you're \*trying\* to quit. I think that while there is benefit to the ""I'm a non-smoker immediately"" mindset you also have to remember that we are literally addicts. Overcoming an addiction is hard, and while self help books will encourage you to approach it with bravado, you need to give yourself the compassion you deserve as you work to be smoke free. It is a life-long process that you will probably attempt and fail a few times. 

\- Tell your partner, friends, whoever what kind of symptoms you're feeling. Let them know that you feel like shit, or you feel sad for no reason and just want to lay in bed and be dead to the world until it all passes. It will help them understand how to support you and also let them know what to expect from you which will help mitigate your chances of coming off as an asshole because you've got some very predictable grouchiness.

\- Remember the reasons you've quit. As time wanes on nostalgia for smoking builds and I can feel the temptation. Not cravings, but just the rose-tinted-glasses desire to smoke again. But when I feel this way I remind myself what smoking actually was: A very rigid routine of needing to smoke once an hour, every day, or get very anxious. Very frequent trips to the gas station to buy cigarettes that interrupted daily life and were incredibly inconvenient. Physical discomfort when smoking, and anxiety about heart attacks and cancer. 

\- Maybe strong for some people, but visualize the moment it's too late. For me it was really compelling to essentially imagine sitting in a doctors office and hearing them say ""It's cancer, I'm sorry."" and all of the conversations with friends, and loved ones that would have to follow. Remembering that it's all a very real possibility, and that many people every year have that incredibly scary drive home to tell their families, can be a helpful kick in the pants to start to quit.

Anywho, hope these were helpful to someone. 100 days feels good to see on the app, just need to keep it going now.",26
2021-12-30 12:18:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/rs6vbg/how_to_quit_nrt/,How to quit NRT?,"On my third day after NRT and I feel real bad. Should I start NRT again or is this just how it is supposed to be?

I did 12 weeks of NRT - patches + gum, and the last 4 weeks I stopped gum completely and on the last 2 weeks (stage 3) I only put patches on when I felt bad, even managed to go patchless for a day here and there. 

No cravings or urges to vape (haven't smoked ciggies in years, vape was my everything - but a smoker for 15 years), nor do I have any urges to chew gum or use patches. But I can't get anything done competently and my wife and daughter are getting annoyed at my uselessness. Mornings are not so bad but at 2 PM like clock work my chest feels heavy and tight and everything starts to hurt. At times, all I can do is just stand there mumbling to myself ""Okay"" over and over again as the misery washes over me. This lasts until I pass out from exhaustion - usually 8 PM. 

I read today that today is going to be my worst day! I gotta get stuff done - and not make bigger messes in the process! I need my old brain and will power back. But I feel like I did all of the nicotine reduction that can be done, and any NRT that I use will just put me back at square one, and the only way out of this is to reduce the damage I can do as much as I can until I get to the other side (potentially a month out???).

EDIT: nope nope nope chewing some damn gum. I’ll try 1 piece of 2 mg gum a day for a couple weeks. This is hard.",7

Im 28/M. I want to stop smoking. 

Ive been trying for many years now. Ive been trying a lot. Im just not sure when will I finally succeed. I thought I did when I was able to quit for almost a year when i was working in the ship. The cravings were gone. I was able to prove it to my self when after a few months, every time my workmates would smoke around me, I wouldnt have that struggle to ask for one or buy a pack for my self. I just lost interest.

But it changed when i got back home. The whole environment when I used to smoke was there again. And the stress that I used to experience. Followed by meeting with my old friends who still smoke. Before I know it, ive been smoking every night again and would finish almost a pack whenever we go out for a drink.

And now im back to square one. I can feel it. My body is not as strong as before anymore. I stopped going to the gym or go for a run or for a swim. The Flat stomach was now gone, replaced with a big beer belly. My muscle tones receded and faded. I used to be an athlete. I loved the outdoors. 

Im not sure if its because of smoking that lead me to this situation again, or the situation that led me to smoking again. A cycled of a mess that circled each other, that i dont know how it begun anymore.

Tonight i will not smoke. And tomorrow i will try again. 

Will it be okay to keep posting here every day? will my post be disregarded? I think i need this. I need to write my thoughts somewhere. I could write it in a diary, but i feel like it would be more helpful to post it where people could see. So i would somehow feel accountable.

You can do it, but you just have to.","I have been vaping since I was 17. I hate thinking about how many years that is now that I am 25. And unfortunately I was very addicted pretty much those entire 8 years and chain smoked everything from big box mods, to juuls, disposables, all of them. Of course the highest concentration I could get at any given time. I was inhaling smoke at least twice a minute every day for years.

It got to a point where I was asking myself what nicotine was actually doing for me aside from just allowing me to continue my addiction. It really was that simple--nicotine does not give me a head rush anymore, does not help me sleep, does not give me literally any benefit. It hasn't for years. And, hitting my stupid vape is only prolonging an addiction that is providing me absolutely nothing. So I just threw it all away (mind you not for the first time). I made the mental decision that I was no longer going to wait until I was out of products to decide to stop. I took all the stuff I had, even though I paid for it and it would've lasted me a few more weeks, and dumped it somewhere I couldn't walk to. 

Yes, cold turkey after that long has sucked. I read a quote somewhere that after 3 days your body no longer needs it, so i've been constantly reminding myself of that. The psychological part is the most powerful. I still wake up and instinctively reach under my pillow for a vape. I still reach between my legs while I'm driving looking for it unconsciously. Then when I realize I don't have it I get MAJOR withdrawals, until I remind myself I am no longer a smoker. It's been working so far.

Everyone can tell themselves they are going to ween off, taper back, give it until the new year and then quit. No. Do it now. Today. Throw everything you have away and force your hand. Tell yourself you ARE NOT going to the store for another pack or another cartridge or another puff bar. And every single time you're about to get in your car, remember how nicotine is doing LITERALLY NOTHING for you. And PM me if you want to vent or chat. I'm not on the other side just yet.",21

Before I've smoked for 10 years (I started wirh 16 years, which was legal back then). I want to share this to help others with their new year resolution. 


My biggest help was Allan Carrs book, no plaster or anything else. I don't recommend everything he said, but he helped me to understand why I was smoking. Since then there where some moments when I nearly relapsed, but the thought ""if I smoke right know it will help for three minutes, but after that I will have one problem more"" helped. And in the last years I've nearly never think of a cigarette at all. I don't see myself as a smoker anymore,  and I'm really proud.


I started running five years ago and I love the way my lunges don't hurt ;) aaaand since I stopped smoking I had got way less hangovers, the most and worst hangovers I've ever got where apparently because of too many cigarettes and not too many beer.

So yeah, that's all, I did it and I know you can do it too!

p.S. I gained 10 kg weight but lost them after I started running,  and I believe I would be bigger by know if I haven't stopped smoking!",48

It’s one of my biggest achievements I’ve made to my body and I want you to keep on going if you’re having a hard time. Id like to share my struggles in hopes that it helps.

My first 3 weeks quitting were absolutely brutal and miserable to me and I had cravings nearly every 5 minutes for several weeks. I had to have a toothpick in my lips 24/7 for craving relief. Even got labeled “the toothpick guy”. I’d go to bed and wake up in the morning with cravings and would have 40-50 strong cravings throughout the day. I would have cravings so bad, they would send me into anxious pacing though my house. I begin to worry that I was too far addicted and would never be able to kick it. But I knew taking even a single puff would restart the clock and withdraw and that alone kept me going.

 I’ve had so many opportunities to take a puff but I stayed strong and remembered my goal. It didn’t help I was also working on losing weight and working out of town. But I am 98.5% over it at this point. I get a quick 5 second craving every few days. But that’s about it. I can handle that. 

After about 6 weeks, things got super easy and found myself going a 1-2 days without even thinking about it! Major milestone.

I had a buddy stop smoking with 0 hassle whatsoever during the same time as me. Frustrated the hell out of me that he didn’t struggle one bit while I’m practically dying lol but I couldn’t have been more happy for him. I wouldn’t wish my cravings on anyone

Seeing my other friends still slaves to their disposable vapes makes me so sad but I understand how tight the grips of nicotine addiction are and I can’t convince them. 

It very well may be the hardest thing you put your mind and body through, but my god is it the best thing you can do for yourself. 

DM me if you need any encouragement or tips or just need to talk through a craving.

I feel i may have some helpful tips for those of you who are still going out for a smoke. 

I personally have had a hellll of a time quitting for a full year up to this point.
It started with just saying i need to quit. For this or that, and id get a few hours in before i caved. It never worked.
But this time really was different. And it was because of that year of struggle.

I started to shift my mindset. I payed more attention to how it tightened my lungs, the sore throat that would start to get worse. And that wasnt enough to stop me, at first.
Then i would tell myself stress isnt an excuse to smoke like a chimney because it didnt remove any stress. In fact, i noticed it spike my anxiety. 
But still, that wasnt enough. Neither was how i smelled im comparison to all the pretty perfumes around me.

What did it along with all of that for me, was on my work break one day, with the sun shining, i was out smoking. 
And i was watching the smoke roll up- not the typical grey i assumed it was, because i was paying attention to the negatives of my addiction.
It was brown and yellow smoke rolling off, and it disgusted me. First time of my 10 years id noticed it roll off that way.

And each time after that i saw it, the taste got worse, and my breathing was getting more difficult as well. So i finally said im done. I associated it negatively all around.
Didnt believe in myself still. But this was the time that stuck.

Trigger warning: brief mentions of self-harm

I don't know if I'll ever feel satisfied without nicotine, I've tried so many times, tried many different methods, but I can't seem to quit. I started using nicotine spray as a replacement so I could quit, but I can't seem to kick even that. Sure, I only smoke every few weeks, but I can't take this last step of quitting nicotine all together.

I feel pathetic, it's not like I've smoked a pack a day for 50 years, but it still seems so impossible. I've always had something to hold onto, be it smoking, alcohol or pills, but primerily self harm. Now that I don't cut, pop pills or drink, this is all I have left. It might seem silly, but these few milligrams of nicotine is all I have left to lean on.

I've stopped smoking before, but even after the physical withdrawal has long passed, the day feels almost impossible to get trough without that moment of relaxation I can only get from these destructible goddamn coping mechanisms. Real healthy, I know right? Before you ask, I've been in therapy for years, and It took all I had to kick those other copes, why can't I quit this?

If anyone here has kicked it, and feel content with that, please let me know there's hope. This might all seem silly, but I need someone to tell me it's not as impossible as it feels right now.",1

The good news is it's much easier to resist those cravings when they happen now than it was in the first few months of quitting. 

I guess my message is that even when you *need* a cigarette. Don't give in. The cravings may go away for you forever, or they may happen fr time to time. The important thing is to never allow those cravings to dominate you.

Personal experience and background:

I’m an ex smoker and used to smoke heavily for 3 years. Now I’m addicted to Nicotine Lozenges (2mg) for 4 years now! And if you put a pack of cigarettes and a pack of these lozenges in front of me for sure I prefer the lozenges. I like the minty and fresh taste of them and for some weird reason I like how it burns my mouth and throat and gives me the nicotine buzz 2-3 minutes after using them. I cannot go one day without them. Wherever I go I make sure I have a sheet of them in my pocket. I mean everywhere! I even have some emergency sheet in thrme pockets of all my jackets just in case if I forget to bring them in my bag to work. Until recently I had nothing against using Nicotine gums, patches and lozenges as I believed nicotine on its own does not harm the body and guess what? I was totally wrong! It does harm the body ( not as much as cigarettes and tobacco does obviously) . I would like to share some scientific evidence of harmful effects of it:

1-Nicotine can cause lung cancer
2- gastrointestinal cancer
3- pancreatic cancer
4- increase risk of coronary heart disease
5-respiratory disorders
6- increase risk of gastro oesophageal disorders
7-immunosuppression
8- age related macular degeneration
9- increase risk of chronic kidney disease
10- erectile dysfunction 
11- infertility

For all those people who are thinking about giving up smoking I will definitely recommend NRT and it does help a lot . However be careful to not get addicted to them after quitting smoking. 
I am seriously thinking about quitting these lozenges after reading on the harmful effects of nicotine and replace them with normal sugar free gums or lozenges.",6

Well I went away and nope, nothing. Everyone seems to smoke in Egypt and whilst occasionally the smell was pleasant, I really didn’t fancy one in the slightest, even when I was totally hammered. 

More than that, in the airport on the way back where people were smoking I just felt overwhelmingly sick and confined by the smell (though that could be the covid I tested positive for 2 days later…)

I post this not to boast, but to clear up what I think was the biggest myth that held me back until just this last few days - ‘you never truly quit’

Went for a extended family vacation at a farmhouse. Met others in the community and built a great conversation. Ended up smoking a 10 pack over the weekend because i knew my cravings were addressed and i could just quit, which i did.

I have not smoked since sunday morning, and have zero cravings for it. All through sunday, till today at tuesday afternoon, I am having the worst headache i have ever experienced in my life, a headache that has completely cramped my entire back up to the point of not being able to move my head in any direction.

I have consulted with a doctor(General physician and psychiatrist) and both confirmed its my brain reacting to a nicotine withdrawal, cramping up my muscles in the same way a smoker feels tightness in the chest and hands after a few days of quitting, and will take a few more days to recover. They did ask if i had any cravings, which i answered truthfully that i did not.

I am currently lying down like a corpse writing this, with two heat pads on my neck and back, a super strong dose of nerve relaxant (Zapiz 0.5mg x 4) to ease the pain, a muscle relaxant to loosen up the muscles (Hifenac P x 1), and a anti-inflammatory/fever drug to prevent the fever from rapid contraction and loosening of the muscles (Paracetamol 1000). I am on the verge of tears because I am having to pound my chest from time to time to be able to breathe. The psychiatrist also asked me in confidentiality to smoke half a joint to expedite the muscle relaxant and also sedate me from the pain (he knows i smoke cannabis recreationally sometimes, encourages me to use it when i have a massive anxiety attack , but nothing on paper because Cannabis is illegal in India)

My mother is severely worried, and while very proud that i have managed to gain this much control over this demon after 2 packs a day from the age of 15 till 23, she is crying seeing me in this much pain.

I never knew this is the kind of reaction my body would have after not smoking for 3+ years and then smoking like a chimney over the weekend and quitting again. Safe to say, never smoking the devil's dick again, not even in social scenarios. Use me as a lesson and a warning, so you never have to suffer the pain, debilitating paralyzing pain, that i am currently biting my teeth through.",9

2021-12-27 22:45:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/rq5tsy/pleasure_masked_as_pain/,Pleasure masked as pain,"All of your withdrawals are pleasure masked as pain. What you are feeling is a natural reaction, a longing, grief, dependence. These are all natural feelings. We are subjected to them no matter what. In work, in school, in relationships, in life.

We are always doing things that benefit us, but are painful in the short-term. Exercise, for example. Not everybody wants to work on legs today, but we make it to the gym because we have goals. We have a goal, a timeline. What makes that different from quitting nicotine?

Breakups... Most people go through them quite a few times in life. We learn from each and every one. It takes time to shed the negativity and the pain... But we are always left with a new perspective... a new partner... a new lesson.. whether you are in control of the breakup or not, it takes time to adjust.

So why is quitting nicotine any different? Are you not going through these withdrawals to benefit your life? To look younger, feel younger, have more energy, less cancer risk... the list goes on and on.

I challenge you, every time you feel the brain fog, the nicotine thirst, or any withdrawal... to remind yourself that is is simply pleasure masked as pain. Think of it like a package. With each withdrawl, UPS sends the negativity to your house. It is wrapped in wrapping paper. And it's up to you to unpack it...

You're going through the same sacrifices, basically, that you have been going through for your entire life... The definition of survival is to quite literally invest in the short term to benefit yourself in the long term. Soon, the waves will feel less intense. And then, your brain will readjust.

With each wave of withdrawals, your brain is re-programming itself. Celebrate this! It's like going through a day at the gym, or living another day without a toxic partner, or studying an extra hour. You are doing the same exact thing! No pain, no gain.

And stop talking yourself into relapsing.

For those who say the whole ""Nicotine is a neuroprotective and an antidepressant!"" Nicotine is not going to be the deciding factor over whether you get Alzheimer's in the future, or not. Decaf coffee has plenty of neuroprotective properties. And I guarantee you that you will feel less depressed when you quit smoking. Your dopamine receptors will thank you.

In closing, these are just the things that I'm working on. And I thought they made some sense.",43

Skins improved massively, can walk way farther without getting out of breath, dont have to constantly think when am i next gunna be able to smoke, dont stink all the time, more attractive to females, more confidence as im not inhaling poison every second of my life, not a slave anymore etc etc.

To everyone struggling to quit, it can absolutely be done if you want your health and life enough, smoking is just a habit that once you get out of you gradually forget about . I chronically smoked liked every 10 minutes all day for years but all it brought me ultimately was more depression, desperation, and shit health. to each their own ofcourse, but on a sub like this I hope we all end up just packing it in because it doesnt do jack shit for us and in the short/long run massively damages our health whether we realise it or not, and without health we don't have too much to offer in life tbh.

When I cave and go back on nicotine, I find myself wasting an equal if not a greater amount of time procrastinating.

I think procrastinating without nicotine is OK and we should learn to forgive ourselves for it. Its not even a nictoine/non-nicotine issue at that point, it's a human issue. I believe that if we try to tell ourselves that nicotine will fix our productiveness, it may for a day (whats a day to a lifetime?), but generally fuck us over in life and we end up wasting just as much time.

I know as far as cravings go, I am past the worst of it I think. Day 3 was hella hard to get through. 

But Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, why can't I sleep? I don't necessarily have a problem *going* to sleep but I have a terrible time staying asleep and sometimes an even worse time going back to sleep. Last night I woke up 6 times throughout the night but luckily I wasn't awake more than 10 or 15 minutes each time, but I also have nights like tonight where I wake up at 3am and can't go back to sleep. I'm going to be clocking into work today with 4 hours of sleep. 😴

When does this get better? My husband has also had terrible sleep lately but his seems to have gotten better the last couple of nights. I don't know why quitting has made sleep so difficult because before I quit, I would get tired by jonesing a bit for nicotine. It would put me right to sleep.

I don't really drink or do drugs, but I smoke like a chimney and love it so much. I've been trying to quit for 3 years and had the past 2 relationships ask me to quit smoking and I couldn't do it for them. It wasn't a make or break deal but it still felt hopeless. I went on holiday to asia with my mum before the pandemic and I promised her I would quit smoking.....I ended up smoking the whole time I was on holiday....sneaking off at first and then blatantly doing it in front of her. I've never felt so ashamed and I still do feel embarrassed now, looking back. I was truly addicted and it was the bane of my existence. It prevented me from being happy....truly....

&#x200B;

I tried nicotine patches + gum, vaping, alan carrs easy way book, hypnotherapy, herbal cigarettes and mindfulness to quit and nothing worked. I make coffee for a job and I used to make coffee for a doctor who smoked. He ended up quitting and suggested I try calling the QUITuk number and asking for tablets which are usually the last resort to quit smoking. The tablets I took were called champix and I was suggested to go on a course for 3 months to destroy the habit completely, but due to BREXIT they only had enough pills to last me a 5 weeks.....What's crazy is I quit 3.5 weeks in and didnt even use the rest of the available tablets. 

&#x200B;

Supposedly these tablets alter the mind neural-chemistry so your brain doesnt accept/recognise nicotine in the brain. It sounds really strange but after about 2 weeks I tried to smoke and I wasn't getting a a positive feeling from smoking, there was no hit or feeling of elation....all there was, was a rancid disgusting taste of the tobacco. This carried on and although I planned to finish the pack of cigarettes to quit, I didn't need the medication nor the cigarettes to feel like I had ""quit""....I just stopped smoking. It was incredible to me as after 3 years of negotiation and bargaining with myself, all the mental torture and draining of willpower....I just....stopped smoking! The only side effects I had from the tablets were CRAZY dreams. Truly insane dreams but the good news was that I never remembered the dream when I woke up, and I don't remember any of them looking back..I just remember they were crazy.

Anyway, I quit in June and here I am nearly in the new year! I can still smoke socially when I drink but I really don't enjoy the sensation or smell anymore.   I've tried smoking at birthday parties and nights out but after 2 or 3 cigarettes my mouth dries out and I get a really bad headache.  What's insane to me is that I smoked for 13 years and now it feels like the spell has been broken on me. Just in time for my 30's too. 

Anyway, thanks for listening and if you ever feel truly hopeless, I do recommend the champix pills, they've saved my life!",11

I've posted here a few times before during my many, many (many) unsuccessful attempts to quit, but I'm proud to be able to share with all who are struggling with this cursed habit that since February 8th of this year, I've not had a single puff. It's not exactly a round-number milestone, but in a few days I'll be celebrating my first New Years without tobacco since I was 18 (32 now). 

In the past year, I've changed jobs, moved house, had all the ups and downs of a normal life, but without tobacco. I now breathe better, smell better and can run and do sports for longer periods of time. Though I'm wary of the occasional craving, and the sometimes-creeping notion that one cigarette, or a cigar or something, wouldn't be the end of the world, I feel confident that I've kicked this habit once and for all.

I'm one of those guys who did not think I could do it. Who thought my life would be impossible without this crutch, and who made up rationalizations to justify his many failures. I've always wanted to be able to post this here: **if I can do it, so can you.**

I’m 24 and needless to say, I was pretty pissed. Smoking was an activity I LOVED. All my friends smoke and pretty much my whole life revolved around it so I couldn’t even imagine quitting after smoking every day for 6 years. But grudgingly I started to reduce before stopping completely.

It’s been a few months now and WOW. My head feels clear, my sense of smell has greatly improved, my mood is more stable, and I overall just feel so good. Just the sense of accomplishment alone is doing wonders for my mental health. Not to mention that I’ve learned a lot about my own addictive behaviors and coping mechanisms; instead of smoking in a moment of stress, I’ve been trying to find healthier ways to cope. I was feeling pretty low a few hours ago and I just decided to turn off all the lights, blast my favorite song and dance like nobody’s watching. I know it’s silly but it felt so freeing, especially when my normal go-to would’ve been a cigarette or a joint.

In any case, I hope this inspires some of you. I’m finding that even the cravings, which were the worst the first week, have greatly subsided. Last night I had a few drinks and normally that would’ve meant chain-smoking, but even with people smoking around me I just did not want it. It even smells different to me now.

My sister sometimes stays a couple of days at her boyfriend or we don't see each other much for a few days because of our work schedule. All good, all fine, of course cravings but nothing unbearable, until my sister comes home.

I take one, then go downhill, next day no issue but I wait for her to come home so I can get one, two, three, next day I'm back at it again and get a pack.

I asked her a few times if she wants to quit as well. No. I don't insist because I know how annoying it can be. We  make our choices.

To make it short I've smoked since I was 16 so 15 years and 5 weeks ago I started coughing up a little blood (think pin head sized spot 1-3 times a day). I saw a doctor, saw a doctor again and chest xray was performed which came back clear, saw a doc for a follow up and he said he isn't that worried it might continue for weeks or months. Mentioned ""a few months"" before he feels doing additional tests is necessary.

I was given an expectorant prescription which I requested and for 13 days no blood, but as soon as I quit the medication it returned.

Yesterday I saw blood 4-5 times in my phglem and I was pissed, thought fuck it it's the last cigarette I'll ever have. Now it's been 27ish hours and I'm doing fine. Sure I crave it but nothing too extreme which leads me to a question:

Why is it that in the past when you don't have many cigarettes left or you're in a place where you can't smoke your cravings are enormous, but right now I would rate the difficulty on a 10 scale to be about 5. If it continues like this I'll be alright but it made me wonder about the mental aspect in deciding to quit. If you reach the point where you simply do not give yourself the choice to smoke anymore rather than it being ""in 2 hours I can smoke again"" I find this to be huge.

I remember being like an hour and a half in and jittery, grinding my teeth etc waiting for 30mins to go by but right now after more than a day im feeling less craving.

Perhaps an additional motivation is that I'm tired of seeing blood in my phlgem as it scares me...",7

The positive physical benefits are less noticeable. The benefits of not smoking are just ""normal"" now. Which is good, but the marked improvement in my health in the early weeks was certainly a motivator.

Same with the psychological benefits. The health anxiety has diminished. Temper has improved. But now that's just ""normal"". Again: Good!

The addiction feels relatively under control and I feel like I can begin letting my guard down even if its just for a bit.

3 weeks and 4 days into this quit and I know exactly where I am. I have been here before. Within the next 2 weeks I will begin rationalizing the idea that I can smoke casually or I can have ""just that one"". I deserve it after working so hard, right!? 

And I know exactly where that road leads if I take it. If I take a single step down that road within 1 month I will be back at 25 cigarettes a day.

And what's most ridiculous? That first cigarette. The one thing I have been denying myself. The thing that has ween harassing me for nearly a month. I finally light up that precious cigarette for the first time in weeks and......its ""meh"" at best lol. 

It tastes ""meh"". It makes my lungs feel dirty. Leaves a slight feeling of asphyxiation and drains my energy. It was nothing that I remembered or was looking forward to. It wasn't this orgasmic, fireworks-in-the-sky, astonishing, blanket of warmth and relief. It was ""meh"".

I wont be smoking today. I will be redoubling my efforts on focusing on why I quit in the first place.

I know what's down the ""just one"" road. I'm curious to find what's down the ""staying quit"" road. Never been down that one.",36

Granted I have days where I kinda want one, and watching old media with smokers sometimes makes me wanna pick one up, but I got this. The idea of going back is a fantasy, and I know if I did I'll probably throw up.

It was hard in the early days, but it gets easier with each passing day, cause you look back on how long its been and say to yourself ""just survive till tomorrow and see how you feel"" and tomorrow it never feels like you want it, amd you look back on how long its been and say ""nah"".

The biggest change has to be dietary. I actually feel hungry again, and while it can be frustrating as I am now feeling always hungry, its better than feeling faint because you forgot to eat and replaced calories with nicotine.

I gave up in June had one or two blips when I went out for drinks but overall was doing so well. Been smoking for 20 years and got to the point I am sick of it but this time of year is crap for me and there was some lovely reminders this year to kick me back down again. 
       So 13th Dec is the anniversary of my brother's death which is hard enough but I have the added bonus of a very toxic mother who I had to cut out my life as she was crippling my mental health. I would like to point out she was awful before my brothers passing but this just poured fuel on the fire . I had to block her from using his FB account after he died because she would write to his friends pretending to be him and this year she attempted to gain access again as well as sending hurtful things to my dad again . This was my first stresser and I had 3 fags.  She then proceeded to call my home phone almost daily ( I have blocked her on my WhatsApp) lending upto my birthday on the 23rd leaving just nonsense messages and she sent me a package but I haven't opened as last year she sent me toilet roll with the message' reminding you to have a shit birthday'. She sent me a card this year with a letter filled with horrible things and making fun of hurtful things she has done and again reminding my brother is dead just incase I was trying to enjoy my birthday. I cracked again 4 fags this time . I couldn't stop thinking about it yesterday and told my dad who just basically ignored I was upset and said at least his with someone nice now. I had a cry and two fags.  Then today Christmas I spent it alone with just the dog again as I can't really cope with people this time of year with everything and my dad lives abroad. Well he didn't even call me not even for 5 mins.  He messaged me saying he was going to his friends for dinner then that he was pissed and going to bed. It's broke my heart to be honest and I have cracked and just finished a second fag whilst having a bit of a cry. How do you guys cope with stresses like these when trying to quit? I am so mad at myself for slipping like this and just so upset. Sorry to dump like this but if anyone can give me so tips I would be really grateful",22

I'm quitting using Lucy mints to help, but instead of the 9-20 mints per day in the early period I'm doing 6-7 (suckers are expensive and cost more than cigarettes if I do 9 mints/day). I was smoking a pack a day.

Anyway, as I noted in my initial thread I suffer from severe chronic pain, and last night I had a high-stress situation PLUS horrid pain all over my entire body. I'd get a craving every 10-15 minutes, but they were pretty easy to bypass honestly.

Part of me wonders if it's due to the fact that I'm (self-diagnosed, but confirmed by psych friend) autistic, and really good at pattern recognition and maintaining routines. The first 24 hours were hard because I cling to routine like a safety blanket, but once I got past that first day and established my new routine it wasn't all that bad.

This morning I still hurt pretty bad (barely slept last night due to the pain), but overall I'm doing pretty good. Woke up and didn't even think ""Man, I could use a smoke right now"" (usually what happens every time I wake up, especially when my pain is bad). Did the rest of my morning routine - bathroom, clothes, MS solitaire daily challenges, coffee, sit down in office to check news, and then popped my mint.

I will say this.. I have definitely felt an improvement even over this short time period. I've noticed I can breathe a LOT deeper, faster, and my sense of taste/smell is much stronger (my coffee tastes so, sooo good right now).

This time is even easier to quit than the previous times. I'm surrounded by temptation - my GF still smokes for one final month before she quits, and she lives with me - have watched multiple movies/shows where people light up (that always made me want to have a cig), and have had pretty minimal cravings compared to the first 24/36 hours.

I'm wondering if the cravings will ramp back up later on or not. I'm going to keep my mint routine going, and will probably start slacking on those after 6 weeks as you're supposed to, but generally speaking I feel pretty good.

Just kicking myself for not doing it before I signed up for my 2022 health insurance plan so I could say I've been smoke-free for a full year.",9

Sometimes smoking feels good, sometimes it doesn't, but it always helps with my loneliness. Recently, I can't stop thinking about quitting.

The problem is that I live in a country where I don't speak the language, and it gets really lonely. I have no friends, and I can't even talk to random people. I also work from home, and my social interactions are limited to shopping (Hello, I'll pay with card, and goodbye). Smoking is my way of coping with the loneliness. I work from morning till night (with no smoking breaks), then at nights I go for a (sometimes long) walk, and smoke a few cigarettes.

*^(Well, I do have a few friends. Despite having fun when we hang out, they just don't seem to be interested, and I'm really tired of asking people who always say no. I also tried doing some sports, but no one likes to speak English, unless they have to.)*

Now that I'm thinking about quitting (haven't smoked for 2 days), I don't know what to do when I feel lonely or sad! If I don't smoke, I don't even feel motivated to leave the house. I'd like to hear some suggestions.

I am using a vape as much as I need to feel normal, and I was happy to notice that I've gone from a pod to half a pod a day since quitting smoking. according to my counter, I would have smoked 308 cigarettes these past 2+ weeks had I been smoking!

I read Alan Carr on day 10 and found his book illuminating but also inaccessible in some ways. I love the metaphor he uses for nicotine addiction and found it helpful to think about. however, I also questioned whether the book was taking into account people who are neurodivergent or have histories of mental illness, as my experience of nicotine withdrawal simply doesn't line up with what he described. last week, I experimented with reducing substantially nicotine for several days, and the affects were debilitating, and I could not find my symptoms documented anywhere as a typical experience. it was alienating, confusing, and embarrassing to experience. I am not sure I will ever be successful at quitting nicotine unless in a hospital/rehab setting, which is simply not feasible for me right now. my brain's reaction is just too extreme, no matter if I'm hell-bent on never smoking again. 

and I'm also starting to wonder...do I NEED to quit nicotine? or rather, why should I feel ashamed or like my quit ""doesn't count"" because I'm still using nicotine and probably won't be stopping anytime soon? I'm not SMOKING, something I NEVER dreamed would be possible for me! and I feel amazing about my decision to quit, more resolute than ever that I'll never smoke again, and I'm sure if I'd tried cold turkey I'd have been back to smoking by day 2 or 3. despite health concerns about vapes, some of which seem valid and some of which are clearly scare tactics that conceal highly relevant info, I just don't see how the four ingredients in my Juul pod can rival the 6000+ chemicals in the cigarettes I used to smoke. harm reduction counts, and if you're not smoking cigarettes, you have quit! 

I don't want to encourage anyone to keep using nicotine if you've made the decision to quit, but I want to offer the perspective that NRTs and any harm reduction are STILL better than smoking and nothing to feel ashamed of. to shame people taking a harm reduction approach is to tell them they might as well just smoke, which is dangerous and wholly unnecessary, especially in a sub that's meant to be supportive. if Alan Carr worked for you, fuck yeah, you're amazing! but I want to make the point that, even if you're not ready to ""starve the nicotine monster,"" even if you NEVER are, there are absolutely  ways you can reduce the harm you're causing your body. so long as it's kosher, I want to share this NYT article, [""Can Nicotine Be Good For You?""](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/opinion/sunday/can-nicotine-be-good-for-you.html) which does touch on mental health & neurological dimensions to addiction, unlike Carr. and again, I'm not telling ANYONE to remain addicted if you're ready to kick it--I'm telling others like me, who might not be ready or able to kick it, that you can still take meaningful steps towards better health.

I will not smoke with y'all today! keep it up everyone!",6

Been smoking since I was about 13 years old I reckon? I'm 24 now. It started off with an Arabic tobacco called dokha. I managed to quit when I was around 20 but one thing led to another and I was on cigarettes a few months later. Started out as bumming one or two here or there but as of the last year buying 30g of tobacco pretty consistently. 

The only reason I've stopped so far this recent attempt is because I don't like to smoke around my family and I'm with them during the holidays. I'll be going home in about 6 days and back to my old environments where I'm sure that temptation will be rife. I'm sick of being dependent on nicotine to give me relief, I'm sick of having yellow fingers, I'm sick of smelling, I'm sick of my skin getting worse and I know if I don't stop soon the real scary damage will start to become a lot more obvious.  

I feel like quitting now is vital for injecting some control in my life. I want to be able to make decisions for the long term. Mostly, I want to continue to be active as I get older. Exercising has always helped me rationalise smoking but I know my lungs won't last forever. Saving money and living an active lifestyle seem like important things at the moment. Shoving burning crap down my throat on an hourly basis doesn't. 

Anyway, sorry for rambling. This community was really beneficial when I was 20 and I hope I can get involved again help support others around me going through similar struggles. I'll try keep this post in mind when cravings strike and hold myself accountable. Hope everyone here is doing well. Here's to not stinking like shit!",19

Everyone that bitches about ""smoking rights"" is bitching about a really, really stupid thing. Yeah, the rights to murder yourself, the rights to follow under the governments control of people that are addicted, the rights to constantly smoke your life away.. no, there's no excuse or defense to supporting cigarettes. Quit being naive. And half the support comes from a bunch of opinionated idiots that don't even smoke, don't have family that smoke and has never, ever been affected by smoking. They need to keep their irrelevant two cents to themselves because they're supporting shit that's just hurting people when they aren't the ones getting hurt themselves. 

Smoking is fucking stupid. It's one of the stupidest, most foul things you could do and allow yourself to get addicted to. I was stupid for starting and honestly every person that started and continues to smoke has stupid tendencies, myself included. 

Don't fucking talk to me about your blind, oblivious support to cigarettes when you don't have to watch your mother continuously get worse from smoking and essentially murdering herself from it. Don't fucking talk to me when you don't see your mother's constant coughing struggles and the deep cough she takes. Don't fucking talk to me about cigarettes if you've never became addicted to them so you couldn't understand what it does to you and how it affects you.

All these oblivious, ignorant idiots need to keep their stupid support to themselves because they're advocating the murder of millions of people. Who the fuck sits on their ass and supports something like that? Either addicts or people that have never been affected by it.

The most sheltered and privileged people seem to have the most opinions about shit they've never encountered. People really need to shut the fuck up. 

If you advocate the murder, mistreatment, the affect is has on people's health, the families it breaks apart, the control the tobacco companies (which means the government too) have on society, the fact smoking in itself is a murder wish.. all in the name of some stupid, delusioned ""freedom"", you honestly need to shut the fuck up because you're not some open-minded messiah that you think you are. If you knew anything at all, you would understand you're doing the governments job. You bitch about the government controlling people through banning cigarettes, but you're too slow to see the fact you're doing exactly what they want you to do; keep advocating and supporting cigarettes so they could control more Americans, their addictions, their pockets and their money. If you really, really believed in freedom, you would understand the obvious fact the government and tobacco companies WANT people to smoke so they can make as much money as possible, it return of people's free will of smoking and their health. Like how naive do you have to be to not see that? You THINK you're being some ""activist"" for supporting it but you AREN'T. You're just gullibly falling into their plan. 

With that said EVEN a lot of owners and workers of tobacco companies throughout time have stated they don't smoke, smoking is stupid, and people are stupid for smoking. Why would you or anyone support a business that says shit like that? They don't even use their own products they have murdering people and you're really sitting here advocating that? It's a damn game for them. We're so busy protesting the wrong shit, we are incapable of protesting other needed shit that matters. People are bitching and protesting over fuckin jokes from a comedian but everyone shuts the fuck up and sits on their ass when it comes to things affecting our national health. How stupid is that? How naive is that? 

The community and nation as a whole are too stupid to make the right decisions that will affect millions of people for the better, all to preserve some imaginary freedom. That's just stupidity. Period. As an actual smoker, I would love for them to ban cigarettes and get rid of them in stores. As an actual smoker, I SEE shit for what it is, non-smokers and non-relatable outsiders do not. Keep your two cents to yourselves because it's bullshit. Quit talking about things you have no clue about and quit talking about things that have no affect on you, your life or your family. Like just shut the fuck up playing activist on shit that shouldn't even be debatable. You aren't arguing/defending positive and beneficial shit, your ignorant claims are hurting people and causing more negative destructive behaviors than anything. But again these people are too slow and too conceited to see that point. 

Ima just leave my thoughts on this to a ""fuck cigarettes. Fuck people that naively support cigarettes. Fuck the people that have an opinion on cigarettes when they've never been affected by it and fuck the fake activists defending shit that shouldn't be supported. Fuck what it does to your health, fuck what it does to your mind, fuck what it does to your wallet, fuck what it does to your lives, and God forbid, fuck what it does to the families that lose parents and kids, fuck cigarettes and everything about them""

Have a good day yall, open your eyes and see shit for what it really is because all of these people sharing bullshit support about it have never lived it",13

Hard part is, my GF is quitting next month (and she lives with me); this is partially intentional so we're not going through the worst of it at the same time, but that was her quit date too. I wanted to quit while I was off work for the holidays to reduce my overall stress levels (I'm a web developer).

I'm using NRT (Lucy lozenges, they aren't bad at all, work better for me than other NRTs I've used), plus my anti-anxiety meds and my muscle relaxers as-needed. So far I actually haven't felt the need for the mints as often as I thought. I've only had 4 today the entire today. Kinda hoping I can make that continue and trend down sooner than the recommended, just because they are pricy and I want to actually putting the cig money into other things :)

I was a pack-a-day smoker, sometimes more on really stressful days.

Hard part is, I have severe chronic pain from multiple sources, and smoking was a sort of ""relief"" for that (didn't really do anything for the pain, just helped me relax). We had another weather shift in my region, which amplified my pain (barometric pressure shifts = additional arthritic pain).

Still, so far, so good.

Hard to train myself out of the routines, though.. I used to smoke within 5 minutes of waking up in the morning, and would always have one right after a meal. Those 2 are my most important ""routine"" cigarettes.",12
2021-12-23 15:31:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/rn4lrl/why_does_everything_seem_better_with_a_cigarette/,Why does EVERYTHING seem better with a cigarette?,"I've been back and forth about quitting for years... been smoking since I was 12 (25 years!). I have quit for a year here and there along the way. About 3 or so years ago (I've lost track of time since covid) I switched to vaping to help me quit. I went to JUUL and started on the 5% and then stepped down to 3%. It took me a little over a week to go from smoking to completely on the JUUL (occasional cigarettes while drinking). Last March my father died of Parkinson's and I went back to cigarettes for a few months. Aside from the occasional cigarette when I am out drinking I have been solely on the vape for about 6 months now. I got a Caliburn and I started stepping down the nicotine... from the JUUL 3% I went to a 30MG, then a 24, then a 12, and I am now on a 6MG juice about ready to drop to a 3MG juice. My frequency of puffing has not increased. I go through a 2ML pod in about 3 days.

I gave the whole background so I could ask this question... 

Even after all of that, almost every activity I can think of seems better with a cigarette. The vape, in all actuality, is helping me a TON, but when I think about a cig it just doesn't compare. Will that ever go away? 

Always in the back of my mind it the idea that if I could just have 1 cigarette X activity would be perfect. I got a new bench for my deck and all I can think is how perfect it would be to sit on the bench and have a smoke! The vape doesn't fill that gap. Does this ever go away? When will I not think everything is better with a smoke?",17

It's actually the reason I started up again.  I felt like I couldn't formulate sentences properly and was having trouble retaining information. I read on here that some people experience this for MONTHS and I'm so worried this will happen to me.

Does anyone have any suggestions to combat the brain fog? I though maybe more coffee,  but I also feel like more coffee might make me want to smoke even more.

At 19 I was smoking a pack in 2-3 days, and on a night out Jesus Christ only knows. I knew I wanted to quit, but more conceptually than anything else. 

Then I got sick. I had the worst bronchitis I ever experienced. I lived alone at this point (21), and couldn’t get up to roll myself a cigarette. So I didn’t smoke for two days, not by choice. By day three I was feening. I’m sitting at my table, rolling a cigarette, coughing, looking at the fucking tobacco and think - I haven’t gone two days without a damn cigarette in years. If I don’t stop now I never will. 

So I decided to quit. And it’s been a few months since then. The desire to have a cigarette was so strong it made me angry some days. When I was stressed. When I was waiting for the bus. In the morning with my coffee. God. Those things were my fucking moments of peace. Just me and my cigarette. 

But here I am, maybe 5 months out. And I realized this is the first week, where I don’t actively crave cigarettes. I will never pick that shit up ever again. My lungs deserve better. 

Anyways, I believe in y’all. Much love and health",42

I feel like I get more sick ever since I started. I also feel like I dont eat as much. I was talking to a doctor and I think i'm going to take wellbutrin (tablets) or chantix (tablets) to help me.

Has anyone tried quitting using drugs? How bad is this going to be? What should I expect?

Thank you!",4

What is more intimate to you than this urge to light up? How could you be serious about destroying yourself, if you are not even capable of destroying your desire to take a puff? In that case you are just a posturing weakling. When you quit smoking, you spend much more time thinking about wanting to smoke, than you do thinking about wanting to quit when you still smoke. Therefore, not smoking is the activity of the superior individual, for it requires more self-overcoming. When will the desire to smoke end? Never!

Being near people when they smoke, to be exact. Because I knew, by peer pressure or boredness, I would be too weak to resist the temptation to smoke. 

All I had to do was say no the first time, really. Then, I attentioned my smoking friends that I was quitting (so they wouldn't give me cigs if I was too weak) when we were out drinking, and I ended up not asking for one, anyways.

The thing is, I felt like I built up some resistance after saying no the first time. I don't even think about smoking one. If you want to quit, just be strong and say no for the first times, until you establish a code. Nothing is built just from one rock.

The 19th is when I finished my last cigarette and decided to be done with it. I wish it'd been easy. I think I got lucky in the fact I quit after only a year in of smoking regularly. Can't imagine how some of you do it 10-20 years later. I admire it beyond words. 

Within the first two weeks I had horrible insomnia and felt short tempered. I also noticed an increase in my depression and anxiety. That's has remained a month afterwards and is similar to how I felt prior to smoking. So I'm going to adjust my medication. 

I also don't know what this is but in the past few days I've begin coughing a lot and have a sore throat. Right now it feels like there's something in my throat and I keep trying to cough it out. This could be allergies, a cold, lungs getting rid of tobacco tar, all of the above, something else entirely. Roommates all have a sore throat so who knows. Don't recommend though. 

All I know is I'm proud I stopped. The urges are still there. But I've done 30 days. I've dealt with nights staring up at the ceiling just wanting to sleep unable too. I've dealt with hard conversations without resorting to a cigarette after. I've only told two people outside of this thread. And I'm relieved by that. The only pressure inside is being able to come here and say: I'm still here. I'm still fighting. I haven't smoked.

(Had been smoking *at least* 2 packs a day for the past 6 years.) 

The first two weeks of quitting cold turkey I thought that I would be thinking of cigarettes for the rest of my life, and now -4 weeks smoke-free- I don’t even crave them. Most of us make the huge mistake of believing every thought that crosses our minds, like the one I had: I believed that life would not be worth living without smoking, that nothing would be as enjoyable. It seems ridiculous now, really. But I believed it, and I’m guessing a lot of people in the early days of their quitting journey would be thinking along similar lines.

Posting this for anyone who needs to see it: You are not your thoughts, your emotions or your beliefs. We all are capable of going beyond all that. We can stick to our goals and act in accordance with our values, and then our thoughts and feelings will follow. 

If you can make it through the first couple of weeks, it will get better. It is worth it.",127

Never thought I could quit for good,"It's been ten years since I stopped smoking.  At my worst, I smoked a pack a day!  Towards the end of my smoking days, I smoked maybe 3-5 a day.  It helps when you are working instead of at Uni to reduce smoking!  At least for me.  I never thought I could quit for good....and then I got pregnant.  The day my period did not show up and thought I might be pregnant I stopped.  It was instant and it was a huge blessing...of course the baby, but also the fact that there was no question or no temptation.  I just stopped.  I never thought about it and did not crave it at all.  Suddenly I was growing a little human and that was that...no more smoking.  9 months was long enough for me.  After, my first was born, I never turned back.  I was over my addiction.  I was lucky.  There is no magic way to quit...a lot of my friends who stopped when pregnant started up again after they had their kids.

If you can make it a few months...eventually you really will not crave it anymore ever again.  At least for me.  I don't even think about it and then when I have guests who step outside to smoke I am like oh yea...they smoke...like it would never cross my mind to go and smoke.

Aside from varying neurochemistry is there any other reasons that this is like this?

I came to the conclusion a few weeks back that brains chatter, and I think and have thoughts like anybody else and I'm scared of the future too. I also look back into the past and indulge in figuring out what went wrong.

Anyway. After being told that nicotine receptors can alter the way we think (the brain doesn't receive the nicotine it gets from smoking and creates new thoughts)... I had many, many powerful thoughts and feelings, that basically made me go outside and smoke. I would head to a bench and buy a coffee from the garage... Or sit out the front and smoke with a kettle made brew... Overall I wasn't happy with any of it. But I was smoking.

I also was fantasising about what future I could have, 1. When I stop smoking, and 2. When I finally quieten voices. I'd be able to sleep at night and also figure out ""why I couldn't be bothered"" or ""why do I really hate game design?""... But doing game design is what I loved doing.

I was told last week that 45 cigarettes is classified as heavy smoking. And boy o boy were my thoughts screaming for it. I have an empty, lost and knackered out (almost a nicotine hangover) feeling in my body due to drowning myself in good times, and manipulative thoughts that sound like a baby crying and needing something.

For me, it wasn’t trying to give up forever, for years on end, it was working through that initial fucking awful withdrawal period, and then trying to get past those little triggers in my life. A cup of coffee, the end of a mentally taxing day, in the kitchen before bed. Those moments were the struggle.

As promised quitting was completely effortless but I was still in college and a week later I got pretty drunk and smoked again. 

I've been trying to quit for the last month after my vape broke (I had fully switched to vape for about a year). I bought cigarettes until my quit day but I couldn't do it. Usually tried to have my last cigarette at night before going to sleep so I'd have already a few hours under the belt after waking up. The mornings would be too hard and I would be dizzy, tired and brain foggy so I'd smoke again because I felt like I couldn't function otherwise.

I really tried about 2 days ago and reread the relevant parts of the book. I didn't smoke for 32 hours which was better than 99% of my quit attempts. I did cheat last night with a nicotine gum because I drank a single beer and felt like I couldn't do it and it was that or a pack. I bought a pack this morning but I wanna quit again today.

I feel demoralized because I remember the first time I read the book how easy I had found it to quit, so now when I'm having trouble I feel like surely I'm not quitting the right way or I'm not ready because Allen Carr said it would be easy and it was easy the first time I read the book.

I was using and drinking and it just ended up being part of the nights. Flash forward to 2019, I got into a car accident due to high speed and inebriation. Chose to do rehab and it didn't stick. 2020, I got hospitalized for psychosis due to losing good connections and taking bad speed. 2021, got convicted for my DUI. I decided to go sober for real after the psychosis.

Except cigarettes. They're slowly taking over. I quit 3 times this year, each time got a bit further but never more than a few days. I figure, each time, that I'll stop soon, 10-15 smokes a day help me get through the day along with the mental illness, pills and their associated effects, and sobriety.

I'm sucking these down and I'm convinced I'm actually doing a lot of damage to my circulatory and respiratory systems. My extremes have bled out into cigarettes.

I used to do ballet. I used to be a runner. I ran a half-marathon (yes, I felt good writing that).

I need to quit. 6 years now. And this year it's become the new scare of my life, after everything that's happened since 2017 when I started hallucinating and got the first of many diagnoses.

I'd appreciate any resources, encouragement, anything... advice, similar stories. I strongly dislike AA, NA and I've used a stop-smoking app. I have Allen Carr's book but so far, he's saying things I used to just think to myself as a kid about my own mother when she smoked, and it makes me feel worse, like this is fate or something.

So yesterday I gave it a go quitting caffeine, all day I wanted a can of coke so bad and then I found myself at the shop buying a massive block of chocolate, I thought fuck it I’m quitting smoking and coke why not.

Last two years I got into a very compulsive kind of smoking.. one after another in evenings (sometimes 5 in a row) leading to an average of 30 a day. I link this mainly to some overthinking about life, what I want to be doing now really after studying and all that..

It is obvious that it impairs my ability to handle these kinds of 'problems' in a clear and healthy fashion. Heck smoking this much probably even causes these kinds off thoughts in the first place. Besides smoking I'm super healthy.. exercising since ever, eating clean al that goodies.. Sometimes I even say it is a way of compensating.

However, whenever I said in the past to myself some vague things like ""I should stop smoking now"" I tried for a couple hours and fell back. Resulting in very low confidence about my abilities to quit. 

Resently I gave my pack to my non-smoking roommate whit whom I made deals like ""for the next x hours I only want X amount of cigs"" resulting in a lowering of my overall nicotine intake ( like 10 a day with less neurotic sessions!!) and some sight of improvements in breathing and feeling quite alright. 

Still depending on it though, so thinking about making a clear decision of quitting. It frightens me to make that decision though, since I don't like to further put my confidence in the rut (by not following through on things I say I should do) . 

Now I'm thinking about making the decision clearer by sending my roommate the amount of money I would have spent on cigs for 90 days which he could only give back If I don't smoke during those days.. Hoping to set the tone, clear out the habit and most of the bad stuff in order to go through after those days. 

I'm conflicted however since someone (current smoker) said to me that you have to be fully behind the decision, making that decision for yourself. I feel like doing this will only motivate me externally and not enough intrinsically. 

What are your thoughts on this? 
Have some of you tried it by making the pain so much harder to smoke?

All advise and kind words are appreciated!

may my willpower strengthen with time? i'll see, 10 days no nicotine is something i haven't done, not yet i think since i started it 9-10 years ago. a single stick is enough of a major setback for me, but i will will manage it. let's hope for 20 days or more this time. indefinitely would be best. this just no longer needs to be a part of my life. not a firm believer in ""just toss it"" because if i can have it within my grasp, and have no desire for it at all i will have absolutely conquered this. now i have to spend the rest of my day repulsed at myself for what i did, and doing anything other than burning naturally occurring pesticides.",7

Write by Master Hypnotist Christos Sfikouris.,"Hypnosis is a natural phenomenon. During the day everybody experience hypnosis. Daydreaming is hypnosis. Playing sports and be in the moment is hypnosis. Playing a game on your smartphone or on a Playstation is a front of hypnosis. 

During hypnosis we access our deeper state of being and we are connected with our true nature. 

When we use this natural phenomenon of hypnosis we can make lifestyle changes so we improve our everyday life and experiences.

However, something strange happens during those first few days that has always puzzled me: I begin to feel the negative health effects on my body strongly. It's almost like I feel worse smoking only a few a day, as opposed to my usual 10 (ish). Can anyone help explain why? This physical sensation of breathing trouble and heart arrhythmia leads to mental stress about the smoking in general. It's almost like my body feels worse the first few days. Shouldn't it be the other way around. Side note: Alot of people tell me about how the body is cleaning out all of the tar and build up as you're quitting-- I've NEVER experienced this.

Here’s how I quit cold turkey. 

1. Eliminating all the physical triggers - lighters, ashtrays from my apartment. 

2. Taking a break from work for the first week. Trust me, this helps. 

3. Finding a new hobby that takes up as much time as a cigarette. I took up chess :) 



Handling cravings 

I’m glad I took a break from work because it helped me analyse my cravings better. 

I’ve come to understand that my mind is at a constant war with itself. Every day it made up new excuses for me to smoke that 1st cigarette. Here are a few obstacles I faced 

1. Anxiety and mood swings for the first 2 weeks. Nicotine can make your mind twist reality in so many ways. My emotions were much more impactful and I even cried at times. 

2. I would suddenly feel that I have smoked a cigarette. Like my mouth and nose had an after smoke feeling. 

3. I dreamt that I relapsed. These were so powerful that they seemed like the real thing. Later I found out that once you quit, your lungs are constantly cleaning out the tar. So, at night your sensory receptors carry the smell and taste of cigarettes, often inducing dreams!

4. Unknown triggers. Like watching a TV show, my terrace, the sound of a lighter, the first sip of alcohol.


Observing myself was the most important part of this process. I read up a lot on stoicism and how we can’t escape reality. I’m noticing slight changes in my breathing pattern, my body, my thoughts.",23

Then a couple weeks later my room mates were smoking in the kitchen and I tried one but without inhaling (justifying it). Then not long after I was inhaling them. I bummed about 15 from my friends pouch in the course of a week. Then I bought a pack today and smoked throughout the day. 

Tonight I realised I am addicted again. However, I realised I still have time to abandon ship before I get even more addicted. Immediately the first thought I had was to just have one last cigarette tomorow morning. Something I have been saying to myself all along. Every cigarette I have had has been ‘my last ever smoke’.

Therefore, instead of giving in to my addicted brain, I ran my pack under water. I am finished. Finito.

The stars aligned a bit early due to a few factors. I lost my wallet, so no payment method or ID.  My girlfriend was about to be out of town for a week, so she would miss the worst of my irritability, and i have a few long weekends off work coming up in December.

I figured if there were ever a time to stop its right now. Or, 1 week 5 days and 6hours ago to be exact.  Rather than waiting until jan 1st and making a new years resolution that I'd never keep.

First few days were ROUGH. Like go to bed early rough because I was about to punch my tv in frustration while playing a video game.

The days have been getting easier little by little... but i feel like my physical withdrawals are still there... despite people saying they should be mostly gone by now.

I have a headache. My muscles are tense. I can't focus. I'm sitting at work typing this up right now because I can't get myself to do my work. I know all of this would end if I walked to the corner store and bought a pack of smokes and a lighter. It would end instantly.

Any words of encouragement from those whove made it longer? I really wanna keep this up. I keep hoping that I'll stop feeling like this soon, but nothing.

The funny thing is, everyone says to avoid alcohol but its honestly helping me a ton because a buzz takes the edge off the nicotine withdrawals. But that of course is NOT a healthy crutch lol.

Anyway. Give me advice, or offer encouragement, or wish me luck, or commiserate with me, or anything. I think talking about it will help me fend off the cravings.

I (28m) started smoking at 17, was a regular by 18. I switched to vaping at 24 and havent had a cigarette since. I also developed bipolar disorder in my late teens. 
In the decade or so I've been addicted to nicotine, there have been several quit attempts, all cold Turkey, and all failures. They all went about the same: I had little to no problems stopping, experienced little in the way of withdrawal symptoms and always made it to 3-4 weeks without.   Right around this point with each attempt its seemed that the mental illness symptoms flare up and I end up taking my first puff again. I'm 5 days no nicotine and I dont want to repeat the past this time around. 

This time I've done things a little differently. Suspecting that theres a correlation between my mental illness and my nicotine use I started mixing my own vape liquid a year ago and have weened myself down slowly from 3mg to 0.25mg hoping that it would make a difference when I finally stopped. On Wednesday morning when rewicking I just decided to load it up with 0 nicotine liquid and make another attempt. I've been without it since then with no withdrawal symptoms, and I'm not using the vape obsessively,  maybe a few times during the day if the urge gets really strong. I have also spent the past few days reading through Carr's book and it has me wondering: am I doing more harm than good by continuing to vape with no nicotine?

However I am attempting to quit. I have been trying the lowest nicotine patches and the lowest vape stuff combine.

It seems the worse craving is in the morning and it doesn’t seem to shake the day. If I wake up, give in and smoke 1, I feel like if I do smoke a second it’s not because I’m craving it but because the act of going outside (I’m injured disability) is a habit due to boredom. Some days (after that 1 cigarette) I can just go outside (or just stay inside) and use the vape.

I started quitting for my 2nd time in April of 2020 and then had some slip ups while drinking here and there until I had my last one on December 12th at a party last year. What's really interesting is November 13th is was the day I was self aware and decided that smoking socially was going against my path to quitting so I decided not to smoke anymore and then at that party on December 12th, I told my friend not to give me one as I'm trying to quit. I eventually got cravings and had someone bum me one only for it to taste so disgusting that it turned me off of it. And honestly, I find that to be an accomplishment. To me, it's not so much about the date that I quit but the fact that I quit and have no desire to smoke anymore. Even though I didn't use Alan Carr's book to quit, reading some parts of it helps put things in perspective and help me stay quit. A big one being to not envy smokers, but to pity them as it's an awful addiction, just like many.

That being said, my biggest mistake was starting again at 22-23 after I had already quit for a few years. There's no such thing as having ""just one"" if you were a regular/habitual smoker. My 2nd time smoking lasted much longer than the first. 

I'm gonna treat myself to dinner and do a workout. Cheers",89

With the exception of a few drunk cigarettes at the end of September, I have been nicotine-free 94 days. Cravings are rare now, but still come at me.","If you count the cigarettes I had whilst hammered (also dont do this, I woke up feeling like shit both because I broke my streak and because my mouth tasted like shit), it has been 73 days since I had any nicotine at all. 

I get hardcore cravings maybe once every 2 weeks now, it only lasts about 2 minutes and I can usually get my mind on something else - outside of that I don't even want to smoke/vape. I still have a full bottle of vape juice and a fully functioning vape in my top drawer at my desk, but I don't even want to reach for it. 

I gained a fair bit of weight but I am glad of it. If I was trying to eat lower calories at the same time as fighting the nicotine addiction, the nicotine would have won. As bad as it sounds, when I got a craving, I had a snack instead. This resulted in about 15lbs gained over the past 3 months.

However, since the cravings are becoming fewer and farther between, I have started a diet/exercise routine and am working on losing it. I am 2 weeks into it right now, which is usually around the point I give up, but I am sticking to it. So far I have lost 6lbs - the goal is to lose 25lbs more, all without relapsing into my nicotine addiction.

Can I ask your opinion on having one ""emergency"" cigarette handy (max 1 per day) for times of emergencies?

It seems to me that some cravings are MUCH MUCH stronger than others, and perhaps an emergency cigarette could be used as a sort of ""pressure valve"" in times of severe needs.

In other words, this might help by avoiding a ""pressure cooker"" moment (i.e. avoiding a situation where, in desperation, you throw your hands into the air and say ""This is too hard. I give up!"").

Does anyone have an opinion on whether this is a good strategy?

OH really? Smoking any better? Nope....smoking is worse!

Oh my asthma got worse on vaping?

Well no shit sherlock anything that gets into your lungs can make asthma work! Common sense there even bbq smoke, fire smoke, any type.

I am soooooo sorrrrryyyyyyyy to disappoint those if I can do it anybody can quit smoking cold turkey, patches, gum, people.....

Guess what? You ain't me! I even had a psychiatrist tell me not to quit smoking because my bipolar got so bad and this was even when I was doped up on seroquel. If you have NEVER had seroquel think of it as the modern day Haldol or Thorazin! Imagine living like that. Thank god they switched me to something that works but I can function!

Nicotine is WIDELY KNOWN and the facts are out there it is an antidepressant.  Ya never seen a bipolar quit just quit (even with patches because they give so little nicotine).....

If they do not have a lot of mania but more depression it indeed gets bad. I mean to the point you will NOT take care of yourself.....and don't give me that it'll go away....it doesn't.  For a woman who hadn't had suicidal thoughts since a teenager and then all of a sudden started getting them again, don't tell me the withdrawal and mental changes didn't cause it. I'll call you a liar. 

Anything that deals with psychology can indeed trigger bad bad things to happen.

To those who say well your killing yourself anyway.....well yeah.....but ya gotta go back to that which is worse thing? Do I wanna take a gun to my head or vape? Well I certainly don't wanna do the first, so I'll vape. Of course I will say anyone who does have these thoughts call 911 or go to the ER!

When I quit I had deepest black hole depression then when I started again boom depression gone, got back to work, became productive again. Well I decided to give it another go, this time with vaping....no depression, no bad thoughts, no nothing.

Maybe people hate the fact that it is soooo easy to vape anywhere? Guess what it's not!

No we can not vape in stores

No we can not vape in restaurants

No we can not vape at 99% of jobs inside

Yes we can vape in our own homes

It is treated JUST like smoking and YES WE WILL get fines or thrown out for doing this anywhere as described. I really don't think that people say that have ever vaped before.

If this is what it takes where I and millions of others quit, who the hell are you to tell me otherwise! People in general are so damn judgemental when they used to do the samething aka smoke. What makes you so much better? If I keep doing this, I keep doing this, I'm sure I'm gonna live longer by vaping than smoking. If I don't, hey I don't it was good while it lasted.

We all have to die, we all can get strokes, we all can get heart attacks, people get cancer smoking or not even lung cancer, we all even can get copd smoking or not......copd isn't just exclusive to smoking....people got copd before it was known as copd for living around smoking coal burning stoves and fireplaces. 

It's typically caused by long-term exposure to irritating gases or particulate matter and that definition right there says it's not just smoking. If you work around chemicals for years you can get it. Miners often got black lung disease. I mean it's not just smoking or vaping!

If you wanna be judgemental be my guest but you are NO BETTER than the rest of us. You are human, you were born, you will die, maybe not the way ya wanted it, maybe the way you wanted it. Personally, in my religion, we believe ONLY GOD can tell us when we will die and he already knows how we'll die so I just leave it up to him. If I wake up the next morning well obviously not my time.",0

2021-12-10 10:23:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/rdazf5/10_years_today/,10 Years Today,"Today I celebrate 10 years smoke free. I (62M) was a pretty consistent pack-a-day smoker for 34 years prior to quitting. I tried many times and failed. Usually just quitting for a couple days before breaking down and starting right back. Here are many thoughts that might help anyone just now quitting or thinking about it:

Nicotine patches/gum: I did patches a few times. One time I thought I had it licked. I was smoke free for a couple months. Then, on a business trip (where nobody I knew would see me), I bought ""just one pack"". Of course, that quickly led right back into my old habits. Coming home and admitting I failed (again) was one of the harder parts.

Chantix (not sure it is available any more): I tried Chantix a couple times. The fact that the drug's instructions indicated that you could just cut down instead of simply quitting didn't help any. Also, I never really felt the magic effect I thought the drug would have on killing my cravings. 

Cold Turkey: This is how I finally quit. However, when I was a smoker, whenever anyone would say ""it's easy, just quit, that's how I did it"", my immediate thought was ""Yeah, but you're not in my position. I've got all this stress and whatever in my life, blah, blah, blah."" 

I will admit that when I did finally quit cold turkey, things in my life were really great. My job situation had changed much for the better over the last couple years and my wife and I were nearly debt free after struggling for many years. So, yes, a general lack of stress or problems in your life definitely helps. But, if that's what you are waiting before prior to quitting, you may never find that point in your life. 

Quitting for good is definitely a state of mind. You have to commit and stick with it. Yes, for a few days your body will be pleading with you for just one more hit. For weeks, and possibly months, you'll still find these strange cravings just pop up out of nowhere. Some of it is situational (like when drinking or being around others that are smoking). You might just have to separate yourself from those situations for a while. 

Accept all encouragement, especially from those like me that have been there and gotten through it. If you have people that are being negative or saying ""you'll never quit"", use that as a challenge to show them that you can. And, if you have a spouse, partner, children, etc., make sure that they understand that you truly want to quit this habit, but constant harping on the matter has the opposite effect as an occasional encouraging word.

As a final note, I encourage everyone reading this to quit if you haven't, continue along your path if you have committed to doing it and know that you'll be able to do simple things like walk out to the mailbox without feeling like you've just run a marathon.",83

I will start by saying I still believe that vaping is probably better than smoking. We’re all aware of the thousands of chemicals that cigarettes have & the disgusting smell it leaves on almost anything we come into contact with, however...

Vaping should really only be used as a last resort. 

Ive been vaping for several years. I hate it. My cardiovascular ability has suffered, im still (if not more) of a slave to nicotine & I feel just as helpless as cigarette smokers when attempting to quit. 

I don’t know exactly why, but vaping feels even harder to quit. They don’t taste as bad, the supposed health negatives aren’t as documented & the amount I can vape is significantly higher than what I would do with cigarettes. This all leads to a person who’s even more addicted to nicotine & with some of the added motivation to quit that cigarettes bring sliced in half.

I know it’s incredibly tough & I aren’t gonna be the one to say you need to go cold turkey. I believe it’s the best way to do it, but I also understand that many people are different and require different forms of help. 

At least with patches & gum you start to remove the psychological affect of holding something, putting it to your mouth, inhaling nicotine & expelling smoke. 

This wasn’t written in an attempt to belittle your achievements from switching to vaping but a plea to all those who are considering it & all those who may have made the switch to think twice, because it really does suck.",146

I quit at the end of summer and I am so happy with my new smoke-free life. I had quit before with the use of the Allen Carr book and I loved it. Didn't smoke for 7 years. Then I was so stupid to think I could have just one. Ended up smoking for 6 years again. Partly because I wanted something like Allen Carr (so no substitutes, no cravings, no unhappiness) but I didn't think reading the book again would do the same trick.   
Someone on here mentioned the QuitSure app. Basically a 6-day programme for $10,- which you do on your own where ever you want. I did that and I loved it. If you want to try, just know beforehand that you mustn't stop smoking before you start. So if you are considering to stop smoking in January, just start the programme after Christmas and keep smoking until the programme tells you to smoke the last one.

I didn't know cigarette boxes looked so cute. If I smoked, that's what I'd smoke. But cigarettes have killed and still are killing people I care about. So... I won't smoke, not even something that cute.

18 years old: I'm a binge-drinker now. That was really fast. I don't think clearly, being drunk, also being 18. I ask my soft-spoken friend for a cigarette while we're doing shots of rum and playing Guitar Hero. Angry friend says absolutely not. Soft-spoken friend says, ""Are you sure?"" Angry friend slaps soft-spoken friend across the face and says ""I don't know what I'd do if that girl picks up fucking smoking. Don't you fucking dare."" But I get my cigarette.

19 years old: I come home from work reeking of cigarettes, one smell more overpowering than the Bath and Body Works products I work around all day. My mom follows me. She asks if I've been smoking. I lie. I have never lied to her face until now. Cancer finally killed her sister. She knows, her eyes get big, and she's just... hurt. I wish she'd screamed at me instead.

23 years old: I'm tired. Real tired. I don't look well. I drink so much. I'm driving to work at 5AM and I am so goddamn hungover with a cigarette hanging between my fingers but the sunrise is so beautiful. I look at the cigarette in my hand. I look at the sunrise. What am I doing to myself? I flick the butt away. I'm done for good. Read ""Easyway to Stop Smoking"" for good measure.

Slip #1: Two years later. My grandmother dies. My uncle is broken as we leave the funeral. My aunt asks me to drive with him to the gravesite, because she's worried. I get into his truck. We drive, and we talk about her. He stops. He pulls into a convenience store parking lot. With a tired sigh, he says, ""I haven't smoked in years. I think I need a cigarette now."" I look at him. ""I could use one, too.""

Slip #2: Acting in a short film. My character should be smoking a cigarette. The producer hands me a pack of herbal cigarettes. I hate to admit I'm excited to see what they're like. I smoke them in the scene, and it's like three years were nothing. But there's no nicotine hit. I don't feel anything. Whatever.

Slip #3: Acting in a short film. Again. My character should be smoking a cigarette. The prop cigarettes don't look good and we have no herbal cigarettes, and between my self-destructive need to please and morbid curiosity about my ability to regulate my vice after five years, I say I'll smoke a real one. In-between takes, I'm curled up on my back, nauseous, and not sure how I'm going to do the next take. Yeah. Fuck these things.

30 years old, summer: This pandemic sucks ass. But I'm playing DnD finally in-person again, with my soft-spoken friend. He never stopped smoking. He leaves on breaks to smoke, which I didn't have to see when we played remotely. But now I am triggered over and over with each time he and our other friend get up to leave. They are the only close friends of mine who still smoke. I ask them to come up with a ridiculous code to replace ""Going out for a butt"", like, ""We're gonna go buy some fresh octopus"" so that my brain can be tricked (because it's weird like that). I get made fun of, by another friend, who doesn't know what it's like for nicotine to latch its giant jaws around your little neck. Weeks later, I follow soft-spoken out when my character dies, and smoke until I'm swaying.

30 years old, late summer: I'm in full swing again. I feel free and cocky and edgy. Except when I come in the stage door reeking of smoke and have to maneuver through fifteen child actors. Then I just feel like a piece of shit.

30 years old, early fall: Stay in a cabin with the love of my life. I feel so fulfilled, spiritually nourished, and relaxed, I happily throw my cigarettes away. I start Easyway again.

30 years old, early fall, a day later: I get a call from a family member. Things are bad, and she's crying for 45 minutes. By the time we hang up, I've pulled over, bought a pack, and smoked two butts. I didn't get to finish Easyway.

30 years old, late fall: Cigarettes became my best friend again, my obsession, my pain, my savior. Like no fucking time had passed. I'm scared and relaxed and happy and disgusted. And I can't sustain it. The hand-washing, compulsive teeth-brushing, two-showers-a-day, the rituals that cost me time, money, and sanity. I wonder about where to smoke my last cigarette. But there was nothing symbolic about where I had my last drink, or my 'last cigarette' seven years ago. I don't need a special fucking place for this last one. Some people would even say just toss it, just DO IT. But I'm sentimental and preoccupied with significant shit like this. So I pull off into a dark parking lot with my last butt. It's an American Spirit, and I tell myself when I've burned away both wings of the eagle near the filter, that's it. I reflect on becoming healthy again. On being unashamed. On feeling real happiness again, the kind I didn't have to light on fire and inhale. I toss the cigarette when the second wing burned up. ""You're not gonna get me, asshole.""

30 years old, late fall, ten minutes later: Google tells me it's a lengthy process to properly dispose of lighters, but I really need to do something about my three BIC lighters right the fuck now, so I grab the mallet.

30 years old, late fall, ten minutes later: I go on r/stopsmoking. I get Easyway from my closet. I'm ready.",20

Used to be able to quit for 1 month successfully until one day I said: one cigarette with friends wouldn't hurt, then I recieved the cigarette from my friend and didn't think about the consequences. Well, half a year pass by and it felt like I was kicking in my own balls for letting myself loose in that moment. But now I have full confidence that I can quit for good, I'm literally gonna punch anyone who bash or criticize me for quitting, I'm not gonna hesitate to say NO to people who offer me cigarette despite any reason. 

In the recent months I started looking into the dopamine system in our brain. And I realized how the heck I was so depressed and anxious after I started smoking. So now I'm like super aware of my thoughts pattern. And it's crazy, I literally associated every thing to smoking cigarette; before eating, cigarette, after eating, cigarette, bored, cigarette, get home from work, cigarette, before sleep, cigarette, seeing friends, cigarette, sunny outside, cigarette, rainy outside, cigarette, it's 3AM, cigarette. Everytime I think of something, it leads to smoking, one way or another. My dopamine is so hard coded with smoking immoderately, it feels like a habit now, like brushing teeth before bed. 

But 4 days ago, I stumbled upon something, an idea. I started to disassociate the link between daily activities and smoking. By creating a new link, every time I think about something which leads to thoughts about cigarette, I immediately do 5 to 10 push-up, after that my craving is gone. What I did was redirecting my dopamine to another action that is not smoking. Time matters. Force yourself to do something else when you start thinking about smoking, instantly, no hesitation, no doubt, do it like you're fighting for your life, vigorously, aggressively. Stand up and still feel like you need cigarette, do another 5 push-up. The goal is to make it a habit, like drinking water when thirsty or sleep when tired. So now I automatically reach for the floor when I have the slightest thought about cigarette.

Going off into dream land. That in itself, their reasons they smoke, makes it easier for me to smoke again, because others see smoking as pleasurable. 

I see that I light up to feel way better than I currently am. Usually bored or upset. I usually can't take the feeling day to day and smoke. Then some more, then some more - until I'm sick of what I'm doing.

I see smoking as a blindfold. It'll happen over and over until I break the cycle. But one very strong belief needs to be in place to stop completely. No more doubts. No more happy memories.

I've always felt better binning my tobacco. But soon enough some complication, and I resort to ""feel good then feel sick"". Happens over and over.

I started smoking at 18 up to 33. Had a break for two years (exceptional circumstances stopped me and it wasn't difficult to quit)... And resumed for the last 3 years. All down to stress. And thinking cigarettes help.

Smoke Free were happy to help me over the months. Answering difficult questions I had.

I think mantras truly do something. Speech is more powerful than bloody thinking stuff!",6

&nbsp;

So here I am almost a year later and I’m already a month into my Champix course and today is the day I’ve decided to stop. They recommend choosing a day 10-14 days into the treatment but they also recommend 0.5mg for 3 days, 2 x 0.5mg for 3 days and then 2 x 1mg for the rest of the duration. I find both of these to be harsher than the treatment needs so just some advice for anybody looking to go the same route.

&nbsp;

Both times I decided to stop around a month after starting the course. It manages to remove all satisfaction from smoking and you go through withdrawals while still smoking as much as you want so by the time you stop there’s nothing left but the habit. When I set a quit date it made me anxious, when I just stopped one day it was fine both times. For the titration of the dosage, the main reason for it is to stop the nausea. Last time I did the normal titration and I still felt incredibly nauseous. This time I titrated for much longer and I have felt very little to no nausea once I increased to the full dosage.

I wish you the best on your journey, nobody deserves to be a smoker.",2

People helped but I gave in and smoked a cigarette. I hate myself for it and I'm so embarassed. I set a goal and I blatantly failed. What now? I'm worried I might do it again.,"Frankly I posted it and then within minutes went to a 7/11 and bought a packet. I took one cigarette and gave the packet to some homeless outside. $13 for a single cigarette cheat. Now I'm really worried I might do it again in the near future. I'm sad and disappointed. I don't have anyone with me to keep me off. I've been having headaches for days now, I think it's because I don't smoke anymore. 

I didn't expect people to help out so quickly, when I got back I reloaded the page and saw the 10 replies. I was holding the cigarette in my hand while reading their replies. I hadn't light it yet. I was genuinely reading their replies and staring at the cigarette in my hand. I didn't have the will to throw it away, I felt I was SOOOO close to smoking, I just couldn't. I smoked half of it and in all honesty, I enjoyed it. Now I'm sad for fucking up. I'm sad because even though I don't know those people that replied (you can actually see my post in the history), I feel like I lied to them, I disappointed some strangers that I'll never meet. 

I lasted 10 days cold turkey, I don't know what it happened today but I was thinking it a lot more than the other days, all throughout the day. I'm worried I might do it again - as one redditor said in their reply if I buy once and give it to the homeless, I'll do it again. They are right, I could easily do it again. It's scaring me. I'm going through this alone, I don't have family or close friends where I live to tell me, NO dude you don't need a cigarette. 

I had a set back and I'm worried it might be one of many to come. I tried calling the US support quitline, I was on hold for over 5mins, I hang up. What's the point? I feel like such a failure for smoking again. 

&#x200B;

What happens now? I can't be telling myself that I'm 10 days smoke free, I'm barely 10 minutes smoke free. Shall I buy a nicotine chewing gum? Don't they give us nicotine anyway, how are they supposed to help if they give us nicotne? My head has bene killing me, for days now, and I've been having nightmares, every single night. They aren't scary per se, but they feel scary. Like last night I saw I lost my dog, like I couldn't find my dog and I was searching for him, Have you seen him? Where is he? Where's my dog? There was no blood or no I don't know weird creature chasing me, I was just in a real distress in my nightmare. 

&#x200B;

I've been so good at avoiding heavy drugs and anything that can cause addiction, I don't see what's everyone on about gambling for example and casinos. Alcohol is ok, but I don't really drink too often either. Other stuff I tried them, did some for a while but I was like ""wow hold on you can get addicted to it and then shit's gonna be serious"" but smoking? Smoking sneaked into my life and it's so god damn hard to quit. Please tell me what happens now? I start from zero I guess right?

&#x200B;

My worst fear of relapsing is when I'm really stressed or sad with work, I have a lot of managerial responsibilities and when shit goes down which happens every other week, I'm worried I might give in. Also if I go out and have one more drink than usual, and people outside are smoking and I'm like I'd like to join this social moment, and then ""Can I bum a cigarette off you please?""

I can get through the day but severe insomnia / borderline panic attacks during the night sends me to the convenience store to buy a disposable vape each time.

2021-12-07 20:17:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/rbeszd/recently_90_days/,Recently 90 Days,"I'm 32 and began smoking when I was 14. I quit daily smoking around 25 and continued to have the occasional one or two while out drinking with friends. Even that little bit disgusted me because of how I felt the next morning. These 90 days are by far the longest I've been tobacco-free in almost 20 years. I don't really know how to formulate a long, eloquent paragraph to review my 90 days, so here's some bullet points:

- Find a therapist ASAP. I would attribute this as the x-factor and #1 reason for me quitting. Chances are, your cravings for cigarettes are stemming from some deep down trauma or self-work to be done. (It was for me, in spades). Fortunately, I'm in California and Medi-Cal covers mine. Even if you don't have insurance Google ""sliding-scale therapists in (insert your town)"".

- The Alan Carr book absolutely worked for me. A lot of self-help genre books that came out more than like, 20 years ago, always seem very outdated and irrelevant to me. But Carr knows how to break down addiction in such a timeless, simple, and effective way. It began making a tangible noticeable difference the first day of reading. 

- It's ALL about people, places, and things. Seriously. Avoid bars and old-smoker friends/activities in the early days. You'll build up confidence to return later. If you stick with it long enough, people smoking will seem gross to you rather than trigger a craving. 

- Give yourself extra treats here and there in the beginning. I never had a sweet tooth while smoking cigs, and I craved chocolate like mad in the beginning. Don't deprive yourself of too many different things at once. 

- I still smoke weed occasionally but considering giving that up as well. Since my lungs have healed up it makes me cough like crazy and paranoid. I also track how many drinks I'm having per week and have a ton of energy since I cut back. I keep it to 2-3 drinks max if I'm out and it's a much more enjoyable way of partying. 

- I take a small amount of mushrooms about once every two months and that also seems to facilitate pretty big leaps forward in my personal development. Things don't really bother me as much in the weeks afterwards and my ego is flattened out. Sometimes trips can be uncomfortable, but I feel like it is me purging biases, ideas, and old outdated beliefs that no longer serve me. I believe psilocybin and hallucinogens, have an extremely important role to play in addiction. Unsurprisingly, one of the founders of AA attributed his spiritual awakening to LSD.

First time poster in this sub. 

I have been smoking on and off for the last 10 years. Before I hit 21 I had never smoked in my life and the thought of it had never crossed my mind. The very smell made me want to gag. Then I moved to Germany for two years and was blasting 10 cigs a day (more when drinking) for 2 years. This only stopped once I moved back to Australia and got Champix prescribed for me: the Australian health care system subsidises this shit. The first 2 weeks were rough, especially once all the gunk started coming out. The year or so afterwards was amazing: I could run, swim and hike with no issues and I felt amazing. Then I started hanging with a shit crowd and it started all over again. 

Fast forward a couple years, smoke-free for 2 years and I move to Denmark. New place new people. Everyone smokes in Denmark. Every little child to their decrepit grandmother. Me, being an idiot, start Smoking again. The fact my new best friend there is a chain smoker doesn't help either. 

2 years later and I am still smoking. I want to quit. My libido is down, I am always coughing, my sleep cycle is shit, not to mention the smell when I go to bed and the taste in my mouth when I wake up. Plus, there's a girl I recently met that doesn't smoke and is super healthy. For some reason she accepts I smoke but I would rather quit and join her for runs, swims etc. Like I used to be able to do. 

The problem I have is my housemate, who also smokes, and the cravings. I find qhen I have committed to something and it becomes hard, I would rather take the easy way out than commit and push through. 

Can somebody please help me? What found worked for you? Which tactics and strategies did you find supportive? I read that someone tracked their progress without cigarettes: is that a legitimate way to start? 

Thanks for your love and support!",3

* For the first time in three years, a food delivery driver dropped my order off at the wrong door. At a 500-unit complex. I have no clue where it is. After wandering around the hallways looking for my food, and not finding it, I returned to my apartment and cried for a few minutes. I was that irritated over it. I had to reorder and wait another 1.5 hours for my food.
* Company X needs me to get a certain type of document from company Y. I book a time with company Y, spend money and time traveling there. They say they can't provide that document and I need to call companies A, B, and C instead and see if they have appointments later. Fucking hell. When I got home I screamed into a pillow.
* A day later I visit company A across town. It's 5 minutes to my appointment, and my pager goes off. This hasn't happened once in the last 6 months, so the odds of this happening are tiiiinyyy. I need to pull up my laptop and join incident management in the lobby of the company. I end up having to cancel the appointment. Now I need to go there again tomorrow.

I'm a non-smoker, but heavily exposed to second hand smoke at home. And I always get weird cravings when I go back to my dorm away from home","I don't know if that's placebo, but I guess you as a community encouraging to stop smoking are my best guess to ask this weird question

My dad smokes a lot. Nearly 3 packs a day, literally one right after the other. I hang out a lot with him as he's a kind of my best friend too you could say. So naturally I'm heavily exposed to second hand smoke when I'm at home (if we drive together in the car, if we eat something at a restaurant, if we just chill out outside, he's always smoking - he's one of the smokers who would light up a cigarette and smoke it although they know they just have time to smoke half of it) 

I'm not often at home, as I mainly live at my dorm. But whenever I return back to my dorm, I start dreaming about cigarettes how I smoke some or hold some, I just think about them all the time, its like having the Marlboro Man in my head 24/7. 

I don't feel irritated or mad, but I just genuinely miss the smell of cigarettes, and I'm always happy if I get to smell it if someone smokes them outside. 

I just have this weird and stupid connection in my head that I connect cigarettes with my dad, and thus friendship, fun and relaxation. And especially if I'm in class stressed out, I think about that, like ""By smoking, I could transfer the fun and chill i have with dad here to my dorm and university"". That's what I'm thinking about (combined with some cig ads and cig review youtubers) 

Is this just bs and I'm talking myself into something? Or is this actually a result of me being exposed to cigarette smoke for such a great amount?",3

2748 days.

I remember those one digit numbers, and how agonizing it was. 1 became 2, then 3, then back to 1, then 2. First time I reached double digits I was so happy. Then back to 1 at day 40 or something like that. I dreamed of a day where I could see triple digits, and not obsess over smoking every second of every day. 

Then all of a sudden, on my 219827th try, I stopped. Really stopped smoking. 

Double digits became triple digits. I stopped coming to this sub. Cravings went away for good. The thought and smell of cigarettes started to disgust me. Triple digits became Quadruple.

I (21f) have been a heavy smoker for almost half of my life now (started at 13 - I know, it's bad). I'm a pretty anxious person and like I've seen my parents do, I depend on cigarettes to cope with everyday stressors and depression. 

And I smoke a lot. So much that I often feel dizzy and disgusting but I still keep going because it feels like I won't get through the day if I don't. It's become more of a way to keep me busy and alert than an actual craving for nicotine as I smoke so much I don't think my body even knows what a real craving is. 

I can't really tell how much I smoke in a day as I roll my cigarettes but I assume it's more than a packet a day, and even more when I drink on the weekends. (30g of tobacco lasts about 2 and a half days)

I've often thought that I need to quit but I never truly considered it as I feel like it's impossible because I have conditioned myself so early to depend on it.

But I'm starting to fear for my health. I have noticed my skin becoming worse and at only 21, I feel like I'll look like shit when I'm 30.  Someone close to me (a heavy smoker) just died from cancer and seeing the person I love the most suffer so much made me smoke more to cope but also made me very anxious and hyper-aware of what I'm doing to my body.

I just feel so lost because I have no idea where to start, I feel like I need to smoke the way I need to breathe. I try to ask myself if I really need this cigarette right now before I roll it, but I'm never able to not smoke (even smoking while I write this.)

I don't know how I should go about stopping. Should I try to reduce the number of cigarettes slowly until I'm down to a more reasonable amount and then try to quit completely? Or is it better to just quit immediately with nicotine patches and gum?  Maybe also something to fidget with because I need to keep my hands busy at all times?

I will be at a mental health clinic for a few weeks in hopefully about a month, so maybe I should try to do it when I'm there and hopefully not as stressed? But almost all of my friends smoke and I'm scared I'll pick it up again anyway. 

Sorry that this is so depressing, I think I just need some motivational stories from people who quit already. I just feel doomed to die young and suffer :(",8

I still have urges to smoke often, but it's not as overwhelming as in the beginning. I can handle this. I'm trying to take my asthma medication regularly now, I always had trouble with that while smoking because I felt using my inhaler and then smoking (smoked about a pack per day) is even more harmful than just smoking and not taking it. Stopping smoking also motivated me to quit drinking coffee, which was significantly harder than I anticipated, even if I wasn't a huge coffee drinker to begin with. But I did it! I'm going to slowly work on more health issues, even if it's really hard.

It doesn't have to be easy, all that matters is that it's doable. Hold onto that.",5

I have ADD, and nicotine has tremendously helped me with focus and attention when paired with an ADD stimulant.

Though I'm having an issue now. I have been able to totally quit Zyn by using a combination of the Step 3 patch and 2mg Nicotine lozenges. Though I often find myself fatigued now, which I think is because of too much nicotine. I use a Nicotine lozenge every 1-2 hours and I just started using it a few days ago. When I don't use the nicotine lozenges, I do have those cravings, so that's why I was thinking of bumping myself up to Step 2 and use the nicotine lozenges very sparingly.

I was at Step 1 and found myself feeling very weak, then I went down to Step 2 and I felt the same thing happening, though it was at Step 3 I started using the nicotine lozenges and finally stopped using Zyn. I was using Zyn at Step 1 and Step 2, which may be the reason for me feeling weak. Though now I feel weak at Step 3 with the 2 nicotine lozenges. So I was thinking of bumping myself up to Step 2 with use the nicotine lozenges way less until I can stop using it in totality. I would then aim to stay on the Step 2 patch long term.

Though I want to ask, can anyone give advice on how to avoid having too much nicotine which causes my tiredness? I feel when I was on Zyn alone, I felt very active, though ever since introducing the patches plus other nicotine intake, it feels like I've been having too much nicotine. Is the goal to be on Step 2 long term awhile weaning off of lozenges a way to prevent me from having too much nicotine? I feel that being on Step 2 alone without additional nicotine would allow me to get the benefits of nicotine without having too much and also make me not have the cravings for the lozenges as much as I do on Step 3.",1

Why then? It's the 1-year anniversary of the passing of my beloved cockatiel. Just for context; I find it very hard to connect with people and animals have already been a relief from my anxieties. I have a flock of cockatiels who all are my life.  
This one cockatiel was my little soulmate. Born in an aviary but tame the moment he came into our lives and the connection we had was instant!. Due to a terrible accident he passed away on the 4th of January this year. To quit smoking was never on my mind due to the stress it caused me. (Note, I don't smoke where my flock lives)  


Now, to honor that bond, as well as my own desire to quit has increased, I decided to honor our bond to quit on the anniversary of his departure. Over the years I've tried to quit many times so I know my side-effects and they're not pretty. Hence why I am terrified and decided to join this sub, just to know I'm not the only one struggling and to find and give support when needed.

It’s frustrating. Even with a lapse I have never lost my dedication or commitment… now I can feel it draining and I need to plug the leak before I lose all my progress and hard work!!!! 

I’m using the SmokeFree app which is great! But, the “advisor’s advice” JEZZUS!!! It’s as weak  and embarrassing as milky tea honestly.  

Also, if you love their advice and have found stop smoking advisors very helpful that’s great!!!!!! It’s just a theory and a rant so Don’t invest anytime here! 😆 Move past the post, it isn’t for you and that’s ok! 

So, for those of us still here, my theory as to why they cannot offer helpful, practical advice is because there isn’t any. It is a miracle that we stopped. A true miracle! If you stopped cold turkey, with NRT, using the books, the audio apps, running, crying yourself to sleep every night…. By realising you’re going to die or by mediation. It’s a bloody MIRACLE! Perhaps….. none of that helped you not light up. Perhaps it led you to the water but, YOU drank! Perhaps it’s something inside you have to access without instruction and it can’t be explained yet? Perhaps this is why advisors can only say “keep going.” “I’m glad you’re still trying” and “have you tried having a bath?” 🙄🤦 #Innovation 

My theory is that no-one has any idea how they fuck they managed to do it!! They look back and think it WAS almost  impossible and as it was a minute by minute process of constantly saying no… something that seems too simple, to minute to explain to someone trying to stop, that they add all this extra fluff in to seem helpful or convincing and to give you more time to access that secret part of you???

….What do you think? 😂😂😳 I don’t know…. I guess what I’m trying to say is, this is really hard and I’m struggling. 😔",18

I’ve quit smoking on 22 september; with the help of a support group. Then stopped going due to social anxiety and lack of time. 
I managed to stay cigarette free for 2 months. 
Then one day I felt the urge to smoke and I just zoned out; last thing I know is I was smoking my fourth cigarette in a row. 
Since three weeks now, I’m in complete denial because obviously I’m a smoker again.
I’m so ashamed, embarrassed and disappointed in myself and my self destructive behavior. 

Any advice? Thanks for reading me",7

Of course it did not bother me for first few years, it was ""fun"", everybody smoked, it felt like being cool and adult. 

But since 10 years I try at least once per 1-2 years to quit. 

I've red Allen's Carr Easyway at least 5 times. It works - for 1 day. 

It is not that I do not understand the things written in the book, I've fully accepted that nicotine is a drug, the only thing that I crave is nicotine, it does not make me happy, it does not make me concentrated etc. I get all that stuff and I agree with it. I've noticed my thoughts many many times when smoking and analyzed them every time. All behaviors are actually because of nicotine ""itch"". nothing else. 

Still I cannot get myself together to quit forever. 

Last time I've quit was 3 years ago, I've quit for 8 months, over night, with no cravings and problems at all. Like the problem would never exist in the first place. Like I would never smoke in my life. 

Something went wrong after so long, I've relapsed. 

Since then I just CANNOT find so much of a strength to go through it all again. I have feeling that the last time was my ""best"" approach and I'm just tired of trying again, disappointing myself again and again and again. 

Today's morning I was very upset about cigarettes after yesterday's evening. I actually vape since 8 years. 

I am annoyed by the vape device, about the liquids, about the coils, I've had enough of it. It's annoying, it takes time, it makes my hands busy all the time. 

I do not want it. 

So, what did I do? Of course, I've red Easyway. 

Since 12PM until 5PM I've sat and red through it. 

""This time, it's the last time, nothing's stopping me."" I've said. I was ready and there was no going back, seemed as easy as possible, I already have all the knowledge I need in the world to quit forever. 

Here I am, 3 hours later, vaping. I just cannot take it anymore. Am I going to vape/smoke forever?",27

2. I didn't have to deal with strong cravings. There were cravings but they automatically disappeared after a while. When you get a craving, just observe that thought and it will soon disappear.
3. Don't run away from triggers. My triggers were coffee, tea, friends who smoked. I still continue to drink tea, coffee and hang out with friends who smoke because I want to live a free life.

i've been smoking around 2-5 a day for the past couple of months, where i switched to rolling after a failed quit attempt. the best thing for me to do i think is get rid of nicotine entirely. i just threw my half pouch in the trash, buried. the past couple of days i've been pretty much not inhaling, smoking them more like cigars. i made 3 sticks today but only inhaled maybe 5 times? losing my desire to do so, as i meditate more and more on respiratory function.

i no doubt will retain the desire to smoke *something* and for that i'm looking for any smokable herbal blends that could mix well with something like cbd bud. if i can find something to smoke on occasion that isnt psychoactive, addictive, with an incredibly caustic tar i would be pleased. i'm more concerned with quitting the nicotine and the pesticide leaves rather than the burning of plants at this juncture. 

ready for my impending pissy weekend, hoping the ones i love can bear with me through this. time to sleep sweatily. 

regardless of how/if you consider the architects, observers and conductors of this planet and universe in which we reside, one really must be aware that the best gifts are often in the form of a lesson. that too includes their gifts.

Had some weird symptoms last couple of weeks and can’t figure it out if I’m a medical miracle or a walking disaster.

It’s been 70 days since I stopped smoking and for the most part I feel great. However I noticed a very strange phenomena I lost sensation or I should say sensitivity. I am actually at the doctors now but here is the things

1) CT scan of the head all ok
2) 4 EGK layers all ok
3) ct scan of entire body all ok
4) multiple blood work all ok. No diabetes , no other health symptoms 
5) checked ct with die no issues.
6) checked for Covid no issues

3 doctors told me it’s health anxiety but here is the thing I’m not anxious, I’m not worried I’m going to die , I’m not worried or concerned I’m having a stroke or something I’m only 31 and like I said every other test I have done over past 29 days comes back clear. So I don’t get it am I really messed imagining shit or is there something wrong with me . The best I can describe it it’s not that I lost my sensitivity like I can still feel cold or warm or this or that but I just feel like I’m not sensitive enough.

For example I’m typing I know I’m typing but I don’t feel like I am. I’m breathing and my oxygen level are perfect as I’m at doctor yet I feel like I’m not breathing anything as in nothing in my nose . I go for a walk I’m fine I’m walking I feel my feet etc yet yeah It doesn’t feel like I’m walking. Like I could probably walk 400km and be ok.

What the fuck is going on with me . Anyone else felt that ?

TL;DR : After 25 years of basically never trying to give it up, I just said ""let's see what will happen if..."" one day and it was hard, but much easier than I thought. But not 100% certain I will never do it again.

I started pretty old, had my first cigarette at 20 and didn't become a smoker until around 23. Over two decades later, I was still rolling about 30 a day. Had done vaping for about 4 months at some point, but wasn't really thinking about quitting. I knew of course that I should, but other than the coughing and the inability to exercise hard (which I never liked anyway), I didn't really have anything that bothered me enough to make me really want to quit. But, I'm also overweight and lead a very sedentary life, so of course the heart issues were coming. 

Got high BP this year, of course the doctors told me to exercise more and quit smoking (as if I didn't know). I told myself that exercising would be the easier of the two and I did start for a bit, but I just felt too tired overall. I thought that perhaps if I tried to quit, I would get so fidgety, I would HAVE to get out and exercise more. So I said, let's see what will happen if I just stop cold turkey. Did it as an experiment. The first week was tough of course, but with chewing gum, a lot if water and overeating I got through them. I did exercise more initially,  but that didn't last. 

What I hadn't realized is how many needs smoking took care of, aka hid from me. I soon realized how tired I really am after decades of working too much and I ended up becoming even less active than before. I have a long leave coming and hoping it will be enough to get into a more balanced schedule, start losing the extra weight I picked up etc.

Other than that change though, I can say that it has been much easier than I thought and I rarely think about it. But I sure as hell miss it from time to time, even wondering what joy will be left since I gave up drinking last year as well and eating less is next. Yes, family, friends, music, sex, blabla I know, but let's be honest, if it wasn't for the health benefits, why stop? At this point, I'm more proud of the fact that I have made it than aware of benefits in my every day life. Well, except for the coughing, which has stopped for good. Others may have other major positive changes they noticed, but not me, not yet at least.

Anyway, I really believe I will keep this up (it would be idiotic to smoke now), but I may start again when I'm 70 maybe and had enough of life!  ;)",9

Quick history

Been smoking 25 years,

First couple of years occasionally

Then, almost 15 years a pack or more a day

Then I switched to rolling and I made 20 a day

And the last couple of years I went down to 10

All this time smoking increased on nights out, holidays, tough days etc.

I stopped cold turkey

Now the issue is I don't feel different... I read other posts and I don't know what is wrong 

I haven't noticed better smell or taste

I don't have more energy or anything

Don't think I sleep better

Never coughed before nor now, don't feel any ''detox'' happening

The only things different are my two fingers that are not yellow anymore, and when I go out at night and drink I think I feel better in the morning

Thankfully, I knew exactly what would have happened if I'd have accepted this ""reward"". And if you don't know what would have happened, I can tell you for sure I'd have smoked not 1 but several cigarettes by now.

Let's be honest : 48 hours is not a big achievement. And I'm aware I've only won a battle. Not the war. But even if this is only another try after so many others failed attempts, I'm proud of me.

I hope you're all doing good today and you can be proud of you too ! You never tried to quit smoking yet ? You just relapsed after a failed attempts and you don't feel like doing it again ?  Just give it a try. You have nothing to lose anyway. And you know it.

I was very happy to finally be free from cigarettes.

Today is completely different! I've been thinking of cigarettes since I woke up and I'm on the verge of tears. All I want is to go to the store and buy a pack and not feel stressed about not smoking.

I'm even thinking that maybe it wasn't the right time and I should just try again next month. 

Any advice???",48

I've quit for periods of days, months, even a full year once. Using all these successes and relapses, I've noticed a trend about how I use this subreddit: **When I'm experiencing strong cravings, I use this subreddit to search for justifications to relapse.**

For example: Last night I was getting extremely emotional and angry. I went searching for others' experience with anger in this subreddit, and was unconsciously trying to convince myself that because I found other posters talking about anger for *months* after quitting, I should probably start smoking again because it isn't worth it. Other times, I've searched for peoples experiences with brain fog, or the benefits of nicotine on concentration and mood stabilization, and use all of this to slowly nudge myself towards smoking again. **I fixate on the worst parts of quitting, rather than the myriad benefits.**

It took a lot of conscientiousness to realize this bad habit in how I use this subreddit (to be clear, this is NOT the fault of this subreddit. It's all on me.)

I just wanted to post this here in case others may notice the same trait in themselves: Do you find yourself searching for your withdrawal symptoms to see how long they'll last? Do you only read the negative/rant posts about how hard it is to quit, and not the ones about success? Do you subconsciously look online for justifications to resume smoking? Food for thought.

Good luck out there people. I choose to never smoke again and hope you all do the same.",20

After 18 years of smoking  to end up at around a pack a day, with the fist cigarette lit within minutes of waking up, after being quite certain that I did not want to quit, and only one attempt 14 years ago that just made me feel sad like I was about to loose a limb...something clicked and without much forethought I decided to stop. It's been a week now and I still can't really believe it. Not that I though it would be impossible, just that it was a really distant concept.  


During the first few days, browsing this sub and other ressources during cravings was really useful so I though I'd share my experience to encourage those that are in the midst of this  first week. 

Everyone's experience is different but in my case I find it hard to put a level of difficulty on the experience. It was both difficult and easy at the same time. Overall, it felt fare more like a mindgame with myself, finding ways to distract myself, and accepting that I would be pretty much useless for a few days.   


I think the 3 mental points that were crucial to the ""easy"" part of it were :   
\- a meditative mind : watch your thoughts from a 3rd person POV and don't let that rationalizing mind make its arguments and case. / accept that there will be negative physical and mental states without trying to get rid of them absolutely : just let them be and pass. 

\-Taking the whole experience like a challenge, a game with myself, rather than a sacrifice.  Also I was really careful to not let long term thoughts invade my mind and to just take it one day at a time. Also what I found during the first day, is that those nicotine cravings are like a very annoying yapping chihuahua, and there was no way such a creature should defeat me, my honor was now engaged !

\-I was just curious of WHO would be on the other side of quitting : what changes would happen to me in the process of switching from a psyche structure partly around this habit, and a psyche free from it ? I found that far more motivating than health or monetary issues. 

The difficult parts :   
\- the first 3 or 4 days I was incapable of remaining properly focused on anything. 

\- All my joints have been hurting for a few days. I am not sure if this is a direct effect of nicotine withdrawal, or of me overdoing yoga when I was trying to distract myself.

\- To see my body, every few minutes, automatically turn around to grab my pack that was not there. If a pack had been laying around, I would have probably lit one without even realizing it. Also it's kind of crazy to see oneself be so deeply conditioned.  

\- the cravings, obviously, but when I look at them, they are just annoying, and not physically horrible : it's our mind that is making a whole deal out of nothing.  

The little things that helped :   
\- My main goal was to get free from the nicotine addiction. So I allowed myself to smoke an herbal blend with my pipe. the First day I was heavily compensating with it. and since, I have only been smoking it at night, and over the days, it switched from a compensatory thing to a pleasure activity in itself. It also helped when I went out and took some drinks with new acquaintances, which is the ultimate combo to make me want to smoke. 

\- When zoning out and not being able to do anything productive, I would listen to that guy's ressources [https://whyquit.com/](https://whyquit.com/), that way I could feed the obsession but in a productive way, he has a lot of important tips and perspective to keep in mind for a successful process.

\- Just assuming that I had indeed quitted : I was not trying to quit, I was enduring the result of my already accomplished goal of quitting. In other words, I saw all the difficulties and annoyances as inevitable and fated. 

\- Keeping in mind that no matter how tempting a cig appears during that first few days, it will in no way be as satisfying as the pride I feel of exerting my free will an other day.

Where I am at :  
\- yesterday I dreamt that I had taken to puffs from a cig without thinking about it. Then realizing it, freaked out and felt really annoyed with myself. I'm glad my subconscious is on board....lol  
\-  I still miss it a few times a day, but it is just passing thoughts, mostly in the late afternoon and evening, and it's not annoying anymore. It is nothing in comparison with the first 2/3 days when I was totally obsessing over it, and I can already envision the coming days I will be able to spend without being reminded of it. 

\- I don't know if it is physiological or psychological (maybe getting rid of smoking has unlocked the ""wellness"" option in my brain) but I have found myself to be more grounded, more willing to make healthy choices, doing more physical activity, and overall less in my head and in a more fluid and open experiential space.   


Well I think that's about it. I'm really glad to be doing this, so good luck and resolve to you all !",35

It seems like my stress and irritability has gotten worse. I forgot I had a swisher in my car, and instead of giving in and buying a pack of cigs, I gave in and just smoked the swisher. The taste reminds me I don’t want to smoke, but I can’t find anything to replace the ritual. I am relatively active, I love running, taking walks, and playing music. But i work at home, and my social life is minimal, and during the day, well and mornings, and nights, I just struggle to replace that time with something healthy and productive. I fall back to drinking each night, which is even worse. I know I want to quit, but I also feel like I am only quitting for my girlfriend, because deep down i feel like if she wasn’t here, I wouldn’t have the desire to quit. She lives a few hours away, so whenever she heads home after hanging out, I panic and the cravings hit super hard. I am just looking for ideas or solutions to distract myself in these moments.

Just to clarify, I have no plans of going back to smoking ever again. In fact, December 12th, it'll be a year since my last slip up and I'm definitely gonna keep it that way. Cigarettes smell so gross to me now that you couldn't pay me to smoke one.  And to me that's an accomplishment in itself as opposed to craving one whenever I'd see or smell someone smoking like I did in the past. 

Anyways, I've had a weird relationship with vaping. It was never a daily thing for me like smoking was, which is great obviously. That said, the cravings would hit randomly. Usually when I was drunk, but even then not every time I am drunk. I'd usually buy the disposable ones like Mr. Fog, Posh Plus, and recently this Mahari one that had Rick from Rick and Morty on it and would glow and flash with each puff. Seemed kinda sketchy tbh but that was the only one available at the nearest gas station as they pulled a lot of fruity ones. 

Anyways, I'd seem to enjoy vaping when I'm drunk but the next morning I'd puff on it and it would either do nothing for me or it'd give me anxiety and then I'd throw them away a lot before finishing, which would be a giant waste of money. Monday night I got pretty drunk at a concert and then was craving a vape before I went to bed. Used it a little bit then next day when I was using it, I felt very jittery and started to get into my own head. I ended up feeling so anxious that I threw it away and then overtime I felt a lot better. The next day I used some CBD and weed and felt a lot better. I took a break from weed during the pandemic because of anxiety issues but it turns out nicotine and sometimes heavy drinking was the real culprit. 

I also noticed that I would be a little bit of a mooch like I was when I smoked with vaping. I would only ask friends for a few puffs while drinking so that way I wasn't puffing on a vape all day because of how convenient it is. They would share it with me but then they'd be like dude go buy your own even though I told them I would only do it while drinking. But the thing is, these friends who vape do it all day and go through pods and liquids quickly because they're addicted and vape daily. This was a sign as to why I'm better off not vaping at all. 

I mean vaping is fine if you're using it as a tool to quit but if you're just vaping as much as you're smoking if not more then is it really that much of an improvement?",5

So I stopped smoking on Saturday (5 days ago). I had been planning to quit but hadn't made a firm plan but I just woke up and didn't want one so I went with it. I've been smoking for 21 years. I have had a couple of moments of wanting one but nothing too bad. 

Prior to quitting I had in the last few years gotten into running, this was one of my motivations for quitting. I was running a 5k in about 26-27 mins comfortably and had started running longer distances as well. I wanted to improve my time and distances so I thought that stopping smoking was the way forward. 

Past few days I've felt exhausted, so tired I can hardly move. Put it down to withdrawal. Today I felt a bit better so went for a run. It was literally the worst run I've ever had since starting running, my chest felt so tight, I kept coughing and I was really slow. When I got home my chest felt so tight and slightly painful to breathe for about 2 hours later and I had to go and lie down in bed due to how rough I felt. 

I'm meant to be running again on Saturday but after that I really don't want to. 

Is this to do with stopping smoking? I thought it was meant to make you feel better and exercise easier?",1

Addicted to cigarettes, porno, masturbating and mildy to alcohol. Decided to change. Guess what happned? Relapses, over and over again... in ALL the addictions.

One day I read easy way to stop smoking by Allen. Worked like a magic. I stopped smoking. Stopped masturbating, porno and alcholo is under control. 

This reddit community has been very helpful to me. My appreciation goes to all you kings and queens here.  

With that being said, I believe that as we journey our way out to freedom from nicotine, we get stronger and stronger. We develop resistance to urges and acquire new skills to cope with temptations. I don't think the urges get weaker, I think we get stronger. 

I want to make analogy. I mentioned I was relapsing in all my attempts to different addictions. However, once I reached 2 months without smoking, then I tried to stop POME ( porn,  orgasm  masturbating and edging). This time it was easier. I have had experience in dealing with urges of nicotine and I could use that to POME as well. So we get stronger and it is not the addiction gets weaker.

If you have relapsed, that means you have a chance to aquire a new skill. That can be achieved by reflecting why you relapses and learning from it. 

Lastly, don't make quting your life. Live life as it should by quiting.

Good Luck. Peace.",2

I stopped smoking cigarettes, cold turkey, 2 years ago. Last month I relapsed and I've been smoking 10 cigs approximately per day. Any advice? I feel like I don't want to quit in a way, im postponing it, even though I realise that this is the deadly cycle of addiction...just one more puff, just one more cigarette and I'll be done.... :(",7

I used to smoke a pack a day and sometimes a little more, actually most of the time more than a pack, that was 4 months ago. 

Now I only smoke in the morning and at night. So between like 10am and 12 Ill smoke normally but then I wont smoke till 10:30pm and then go to sleep at midnight. When I started my quitting project I found it fun to push the hours further and further towards the end of the day, it gave me a sense of accomplishment and felt a confidence boost and thus a boost in my self image which is great for someone who's depressed like me.

The plan was to eliminate the night time smoking and the morning smoking one at a time but haven't been able to do that, i find it too hard even though I'm able to go 10 and a half hours of the day without smoking. All I'd have to do is go without them for another hour and a half and then i get to smoke in the morning till it's time to stop those ones too but I'm just not able to do that.

Any advice would be appreciated. Also I'm on Wellbutrin XL(Not the smoking cessation version) which curbs the cravings a bit but still cant seem to quit. Anyways, that's my situation, does anyone have any advice? Thanks guys",2

I've been cigarette free for 5 years (best of luck to all of you still trying), but i've been on and off nicotine substitute, and still feel like i need my 5 gums a day.
I started to worry about the consequences of a long term consumption of nicotine substitutes, as they are mostly made for a short term use, and ofc the benefits of quitting smoking outweighs any side effects.
I tried to find information or research about it, but i couldn't find any reliable source about long term consequences of nicotine substitutes, so here I am, hoping ex-smokers can help!
If any of you used those for a long time, or have any info, it would be amazing to have your feedback",5

Because iqos doesn’t smell so bad and u can smoke it anywhere, I started smoking 2 packs per day-before that I smoked 1/1.5 with normal cigarettes. 
I’ve always wanted to quit and I always wanted it to be while I’m young.. it just feels like I’m breaking up with somebody(I know it sounds stupid).
So my question is-does anybody have an experience with quitting iqos and any tips :)
Because it’s kinda hard, because you don’t see any difference in regard to the smell, taste, etc.

So I'm 24 but I started smoking at 15, one of my problems is that I can't imagine a day without smoking since all the years of me living on my own where always mixed up with smoking. last week my girlfriend broke up with me and one of the problems was that I smoked to much, which was fair to say, I smoked between 25 and 30 cigarettes a day. I haven't had an easy start in life like I assume not many people have had an easy beginning. but moving forward I want to move into a better direction. so I have a few questions some of you might be able to help me with.  


1. did you replace smoking with one habit? or maybe multiple habits? and how can I make sure that I don't get addicted to another stupid thing?
2. What is the number one thing you say to yourself when you're craving?
3. Most important question, I have the tendency when times are hard to just say ""F.. This"" and get a pack of cigarettes, it is not the basic craving more like the thought that without smoking life won't be fulfilling, anyone has any methods of dealing with these thoughts?
4. and fourth are there people that struggled with PTSD while they wanted to quit smoking, sometimes the waves of anxiety & stress just blow me away, any suggestions how to deal with these emotions?
