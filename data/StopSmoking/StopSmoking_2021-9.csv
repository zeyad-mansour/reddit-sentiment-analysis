Well,  I nailed the interview and am pretty much guaranteed the position and I'm feeling great!

I started smoking at I think 19 or 20. I'm 35 now. Several times I've tried to quit. I think the longest I ever went was a few month in my 20s and once for about 4 months five years ago. I've tried cold turkey methods with guidance, I've also tried patches or vaping instead of smoking. Vaping of course works, its just expensive and a lot of the motivation is the cost. Patches are much cheaper in my country. Though its still hard to just use the patch and nothing else. Anyway what really forces me back into it more than anything else is anger. 

I know irritability is a common side effect of withdrawal. The thing is even as a smoker I can be an irritable person. I have actually talked to a therapist about it but I can't afford to see one right now. Little stuff does frustrate me and while I have been verbally temperamental at times I have never in my life been violent. I just get worked up about little stuff and can give you a nice long rant. 

But when I don't have nicotine in my system, frankly, I frighten myself. My thoughts are not just ""irritability"", they are violent thoughts. Something in politics or entertainment will annoy me and I start having violent fantasies about the person in question. I'll start to fantasize about scenarios that haven't even happened and get images in my mind that are really disturbing and violent. I feel not just irritable but frankly consumed by a homicidal rage. And I know the only thing that will make them go away is nicotine. This can't be normal. I've tried so many times to quit and always I go right back to it because even though I hate myself as a smoker I hate myself when I'm not smoking so much more. I want everyone to know I can say with 100% certainty that I am not violent in actions and never would be. I've never hurt anyone, I'm not a dangerous psychotic, I promise you so please I'm being very vulnerable by admitting that this goes on inside me. I don't like that I think these things and what I'm trying to figure out is if anyone elses thoughts are so extreme when they are in withdrawl and if they ever stopped if so. When ""irritability"" is listed as a symptom, that doesn't feel like it describes the intensity of these feelings of raw hatred. I'm scared to be around people. I know I wouldn't hurt anyone but I might express the feeling and scare them away. So I smoke. And I hate it. And yet I feel like I pretty much have to just give up and live with being a smoker for the rest of my life. It might be less depressing than the constant failure to quit and these thoughts that plague my brain every time I try to quit.",6

So I’m picking myself up, dusting myself off, and continuing to go after 8 fewer cigarettes. Obviously not smoking would have been better, but I’m giving myself compassion. I’m only human.

The following triggers were there for me:

1) Somebody left their cigarettes in the break room

2) I was having a REALLY, REALLY crappy Monday. Like, considering turning in my notice crappy.

3) I had to deal with a poopy, disgusting, clogged toilet at work (janitorial position) which

4) Was not fixed after a solid plunge

I smoked, and the nicotine took the edge off a little, but of course once the cigarette was done I STILL had to deal with a clogged poopy toilet.

Again, I’m only human and a lot of people  would have wanted something to take the edge off in that case. The best thing I can do is be prepared to deal with such a trigger before it happens again. So tonight I’m meditating before bed. I will meditate every night until the streak is broken.

I'm tired of spending 400 a month on smokes. I'm tired of feeling the way I do. And I'm tired of affecting those around me. But mentally I don't feel strong enough or ready enough especially when smoking 2 or more packs a day. 

Don't know if I'm looking for advice or just ranting. I know people quit and go through relapses. I don't have a very addictive personality but this is just one of those things I can't shake.

Day 4 was easier.

Today is hard again. My husband is attempting to quit with me. He caved and bought a pack yesterday but he only smoked two out of it. He wouldn't let me throw them out so I taped the pack closed and wrote over the tape overlap for accountability. If either of us want one, we have to break the seal.

I put the pack away, so it's not in view, but I keep thinking about the fact that it's there. I really should just destroy it. 

My brain keeps latching onto the idea of Just One. It's such a lie. Such a terrible lie. There is no Just One. There never has been. One begets another begets another.

I've been doing my best to keep busy. Every time I get a craving I go do a chore for ten minutes. It's been 50/50 whether it works to stem the craving. At least the house is cleaner. I haven't left a single dish in the sink since my quit started lol.

Wish I'd done it earlier.,"So this isn't a 'I've quit and I'm feeling brilliant' post. This is a 'I couldn't quit but I've cut right down' post. Mainly because I'm over an extremely stressful time in my life (lost job and ex partner in the same month). Here's what I've noticed for those who are still on 20 a day. 

\- If you're male, smoking DEFINITELY affects your sex life. Time it takes to get hard. Endurance. Size. Girth. Yeah. Since I cut right down my new g/f says she feels like I am 'bigger'. I can also last longer. 

\- Naturally, only on five a day I'm only buying a pack once every four days. Money saved. 

\- My appetite has increased. I actually feel properly hungry now and eating doesn't feel like a chore that I have to do because it's the right time of day. 

\- I'm not coughing constantly in the morning. 

\- A few hours after waking up I feel like I am full of energy and have a mega amount of stamina. In the gym I can train for at least 30 mins longer and the pump I get is unreal. 

The plan is to quit completely (eventually). Not sure when. Take it from me though, if you're still smoking 20 a day you kinda get used to feeling a certain way and it feels like that's how life feels. It's not. I use the Quickmist here in the UK and only smoke after a meal. Kinda when I enjoy it the most, like most people. 

If you can't quit, or you keep trying to quit but can't, get some fast acting NRT and only smoke when you really feel like having one. I attribute most of the benefits I felt to having increased oxygen levels in my blood. Can only be a good thing !!",4

I was never a heavy smoker. Used to smoke 7-10 sigarettes a day, but after quitting my sense of smell heightened tremendously. So much that it sometimes overstimulates me to the point I want to avoid people, food or places that I feel smell 'funky' now. It can be really distracting and annoying. I tought it would normalise after a while, but it hasn't yet.

Has anyone experienced something similair? Do you have any tips? How long did it take before your smell 'normalised' again?",3

I have been a smoker since 2010 and burn 4 to 5 cigarettes on average everyday. Sometimes over a pack of 10 in a day. A couple weeks back it just occurred to me to quit smoking. It's been over 15 days now that I haven't tasted nicotine.

I was able to suppress the urge by keeping myself busy with work, reading, netflix. 

I have also gone without smoking for a whole month during the Ramadan fasts. The hunger was a good distraction. But now, I don't think I can stay calmly without smoking. I get anxious, have difficulty breathing and cannot concentrate in my work.

I have compulsions sometimes to bite my nails, clench my wrists tight, repeatedly crack my knuckles and neck. These compulsions are getting amplified every minute.

How did you manage to quit smoking?
Did you exhibit any symptoms in your journey?
Did you slip? 
Is it ok to slip and smoke one cigarette a day as reward?",1

I'm only 34. My first drag was closer to 8 y/o, but I grew up in smokey houses and smokey cars, so really I've been addicted to nicotine pretty much my whole life.

I've quit many times before or as I decided to phrase it, I ""practiced quitting"" many times. Only 3 times did I last over six months. First time was when I was pregnant(kiddo is now 13), second time I quit 2 months shy of 5 years(!) I thought I was free and done forever! Then some stuff got super messy and I started again. All it takes is ONE... *sigh* then a couple of months after I restarted I quit for 3 months and then 6 months, and several other times as well. I fought it, but I failed. Now I've been regularly smoking for oh, I'm not exactly sure, but probably close to two years again. 
I don't like smoking. I don't enjoy the taste, the drags, the exhale, the smell, any of it.
When I quit for almost 5 years, I went from cigarettes to having vape in the morning, moved my cigarettes later in the day, until I was only vaping, then worked my nicotine down to 0 MG, then vaped later in the day until it was days between, then months, I kept my vape charged and within reach for six months after I quit. 
That just sounds like a lot to go through right now, I just want to be done. So I'm going to try the quitsure.
I'm just ready to be done, yet I keep picking up cigarettes... I had swapped to vape again a few months ago, but I  haven't even been using my vape lately at all, just keep smoking...
I smoke about half a pack a day consistently, more when I drink which is about a couple times a week 2 weeks a month. 

Anyways, glad to be here.",3

Four nights ago, after massively chain-smoking for days, I went to bed around 10pm and awoke about 2:30am feeling llike I was  about to die. I was ompletely wracked with pain. I do  have an ongoing digestive disorder and am no stranger to pain, but this was ***PAIN***.

Also had a bit of the old vomit, which tasted feral. Aftr a few hours, I realised that taste was from the cigaretttes. I had not had a cigarette since just before bed the previous night, so I decided to just continue not having one. (Can't buy any anyway because I'm still not well enoughh to leave the house.)

)I have had no craings whatsoever. My mind will occasionally think of the habit, but I just tell myself it's been four days now, might as well keep going. I've been wanting to quit for years so it would be ridiculous to smoke again now while it's so easy to not smoke.

I’ve had lapses and relapses, ‘pulling my hair out, hate everyone, drive into a wall’ type of cravings and weeks of forgetting I ever smoked and I wouldn’t change any of it.

- My health has never been worse. That is, I’m fatter than ever and have somehow got some pretty serious stomach and bowel issues which started at almost exactly the same time as giving up. (Probably from the binge eating and the over exercising combo.)   
- I would still love a ciggie sometimes. 
- I know I can still lapse at any moment. I know I can still lapse at any moment. I know. 

However…..

I am delighted that it has been 6 months since I had a cigarette in my car! 6 months of a smoke free home, 6 months of never buying a packet, 6 months of walking around my home without always carrying a packet and a lighter…. 6 months of freedom! 6 months of cuddles with my nieces and nephews and family and friends without any fear and/or guilt and shame of stinking! 6 months of delicious food and drink… money and pride!!! 6 months of enjoying the warm inside and coffee breaks uninterrupted, 6 months of really listening and connecting to people without the mind taking me off to that nicotine craving every few minutes. 6 months of not being distracted by my addiction every single moment…… 6 months closer to taking that last EVER puff.

When we have fear, anxiety or something like that usually these feelings place in the middle of the chest, this is the place where fears usually feels, center place. Every person, doesn't matter smoker or not, feels these feelings often in this place in the body.

But where we feel desire to smoke (cravings) ?

In my experience, It is the same place, in the chest, because lack of nicotine make us anxious.

And when we quit smoking, even in months, sometimes when we feel us sad or anxious we MAY think that It's cravings BUT in the real it's is just anxiety or another emotion in the chest.

So don't let your brain mix cravings with feelings when you feel sad or somewhat else.

It needs sometime to rewire our brains and find out that these feelings in the chest are not signs of the cravings. 

Also I want to notice that very big help gives mindfulness practice especially when we have cravings. It learn us to let it go. One of the important skills especially when we try to free ourselves in our inner space is observe and let it go. not pressure. but just letting go.

This way we can save our energy and don't feel us overloaded.

You'll let it go in one day totally, this feeling that you're smoker, or you are ex-smoker, or you hate smoking or romanticize it. In one day you'll just let smoking in your head disappear. When you won't overthinking about It. You'll know just fact that you were smoker and now you are free.

But don't hurry and don't make too pressure in you. If you feel yourself right now sad about your decision to stop, you should know, you'll be better. 100%. 

If you feel overwhelmed about your decision, just do step by step. You'll see you'll be better.

For example, only one month ago I felt myself very different and harder than I feel now. 

I don't want to describe all these changes and benefits. You can check out my post where I describe benefits after 1 month. And imagine that It become more and more visible and sensible.

Good luck, you should know you can do it if you really want, I know sometimes you feel like you can't, but just go forward and you'll see.",34

2021-09-26 19:02:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pw4fob/third_time_is_a_charm/,Third time is a charm.,"I'll try to be straight foward about it because that's how sick I am of cigarettes, even just talking about my struggles is driving me nuts.

I have smoked since I'm 22 years old and it was over the stupidiest reason ever: wanting to fit in with a new group of friends (the friends didn't last but damn the addiction did). It has been almost 8 years since then, and I've been talking about quiting for at least 4 of it, so I can see why I won't take myself that seriously anymore. I never intended to smoke for long, I just fell in an addiction that was custom made for someone as anxious and compulsive as I am.

This year I finally got my shit together and got to spend one month without it (I'd smoke very rarely one or two, but still counted as quitting). I didn't use any help, just plain will power, which was very hard but made me proud of myself. Unfortunately I relapsed when one of my best friends had a very awful psychotic breakdown and I had to babysit him for months, the stress simply got me and therefore for this one I forgive myself. Around june I decided it was time to do it again, this time with the help of bupoprione, and it was actually pretty easy. I don't think it was only because of the medication, but also because I had the right mindset at the time, THAT one reddit is always saying you need to have in order to actually quit. After a month totally free I even dropped the medication because I was honestly feeling in complete control, happy as never, no coughs, barelly any breathing issues, no stinky clothes and room, not even suffering while hanging with other smokers (I do smoke week though, which helped with these social cravings specifically). Then last month I traveled with my boyfriend, who likes to smoke socially but has no problem not doing it in front of me. I'm not sure how it happened but we decided to buy just a few cigarretes to take for camping, since it was a bit of a tradition back when I used to smoke, and I remember how terrible and completely scared I felt while puffing it again, and of course just a few units became a few packs and soon I was back on it. I know that it isn't my SO responsability to take care of me or my decisions, but I felt very let down for how easy it was for him to just let me relapse while knowing how hard it was for me (but I also understand him since I'd be on loops saying 'it's ok, with the medication is easy, I will be one of these people who quit whenever they want and that's it'. Yeah right.).

Anyways, the medication didn't help this time simply because I lost that right mindset needed. Up to that I did a full medical check up and it seems like although smoking clearly makes me cough and gets me throath pain, I am healthier as never. No ashma, no allergies, not a single respiratory issue to be worried about, and I also don't have kids or anyone to 'take into consideration'. I know this sounds insane, but the fear of immediate health issues was a great motivator, and now more than never I need to do it just out of my will, just for knowing it will be bad on the future, just for not liking to be a smoker and this will have to do it, I guess, but damn that's hard.

I've decided to do it again. Tomorrow is the day. I don't have buproprione anymore and I'd take a long time to get it, so I've bought a few nicotine tablets, lots of cinnamon candy and a couple of shitty red-label cigarretes as well. My plan is to wake up, clean my room (and the disgusting ashes around) and dedicate all my free time on listening Allen Carr's audiobook (that's what the cigarrettes are for, also if it gets really difficult to resist relapsing at least I'll do it with something that reminds me how bad it can be.). I've tried all of these before and none has worked because I didn't have this mtfking mindset, but I can't give up so that's how my strategy will go this time. I'm desperate and honestly sick of dealing with this for so long, I'm utterly mad and willing to use this on my favor. Also, I hope this time I've learned the lesson: it. is. never. just. one.

Thank you guys for reading, I'm currently the only person in my social circle actually wanting to quit and it can get very lonely. Do you guys have any other tips to help me? Does anyone want to be my quitting buddy? God, I really hope I get it right this time.

Best of luck to us all.",6

* Not sleeping and the intense dreams when I finally do. Can't wait till I have my first ""Oh no I smoked"" dream. Waking up from those always makes me more determined to stay a nonsmoker

* Everyone around me expecting me to behave awful because I'm in the process of quitting. Please let me tell you I'm quitting smoking without cringing or implying you're sorry for my husband. Yes my emotions are heightened, no that doesn't mean I'm suddenly a raging asshole. 

* Having to acknowledge how much I was using cigarettes to avoid things and letting a lot of stuff pile up. Now there's no ""I'll deal with it after a cigarette. Not this cigarette but next cigarette. Well actually the cigarette after dinner.""

Beyond the excellent health benefits [(check out the improvement on my gums!)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/73vub5/before_after_quitting_smoking_four_years_of_gum/), quitting helped me really feel like I was in charge of my life.

I could be stronger than addiction, social pressure, marketing pressure - all of it.

I quit one year (and 2 days, I've been busy) ago after 11-12 years of smoking. I even totally forgot about it except I set an alarm when I decided to quit. 

Honestly, the last year, I haven't even thought about cigarettes. (Also was a pipe smoker, and cigars, and vaping). Neither lusted for them, nor hated them. Just completely out of sight out of mind. Indifferent. Forgot I was even a smoker, except for the odd times that I smelled it and thought ""Oh, a smoker. Didn't I used to be like that? Smells kind of unpleasant."" 

I have no right to tell you how to live your life and all, but for me - I don't miss it at all, and... you know,...it's not great. It's just... normal. No triumph - just normal blandness. Tobacco's not some magic pixie dust, nor is it some insurmountable demon. It's just something you don't think about. I have no doubt that I won't ever smoke again. I know current quitters have tough problems, and it's not that easy, but just accept this: **You're a non-smoker. You're normal.** Non-smokers don't even think about cigarettes. Cigarettes? What? Wtf is that? **Smokers are people who think about smoking. Non-smokers don't even notice it.** 

Good luck! And trust me - it's not better now. Life's still whatever. But a puff does nothing for me.",21

I quit smoking in Dec 2018. Cold turkey, full stop. I had a week-long relapse in Jul 2019 (stemming from the desire to just have ""one"" cigarette with a beer on the patio) and stopped it from going any further. I felt so *strong* and almost kind of smug. I kicked its ass and walked away. 

My husband quit in Sep 2019, on our wedding day. We went on honeymoon and actually got to enjoy ourselves instead of stopping every hour to refill with nicotine. 

In Dec 2019 my dad was diagnosed with cancer. I almost relapsed. In Apr 2020 my brother died suddenly. I started smoking at the viewing. 

Three months later my husband started smoking again too. 

Since then I've had four attempted quits. Each lasted between 2 days and 2 weeks and then the stress became unbearable.

Two nights ago I went out for my last cig of the night and it tasted like I was smoking straight ammonia. Like just insanely gross and acrid. I have no idea why - I'd smoked the whole rest of the pack without issue. Something about that last one just really tasted disgusting. And I put it out immediately.

Yesterday I couldn't bring myself to want to smoke, the memory of that taste still fresh in my mind. Around 8pm I got a little antsy for one, but I realized I was almost at 24 hours and it seemed dumb to give up that progress for something I don't even actually need.

Today is hard. My husband got up and got his coffee and went outside to smoke and my addiction monster keeps telling me I could just have one. Isn't it nice to sit in the sunshine? Isn't the weather particularly nice out? Isn't this the kind of day you wait all year for, balanced between summer warmth and fall chill? 

Yes. But none of it is made better by a cigarette. And I know that. I know it to my very core that it's a beautiful lie. The cigarette will always be the least enjoyable part of (what it tells me) it enhances. In reality it enhances nothing. It's a useless, smelly, expensive anchor. And I hate that I want it right now.

36 hours have elapsed. I know I'm halfway through the worst of it and I'm trying to hold onto that. I'm just so frustrated with all of it. I'm mad at myself more than anything for being back here again. And I know the way to make it up to myself is to succeed. And I know I've found success before. But right now it's hard not to be down on myself when I keep wanting the thing that's trying to kill me.",8

Today my partner told me to go back to England and leave him, because we want different things. And in that moment the only comfort I could think of was to smoke, so I went to buy tobacco and smoked a cigarette. I fucked up what I worked very hard for under the circumstances.

I'd love to know what has worked for you all, what has not helped, anything and everything.

His biggest fears right now are stress and boredom. He loves smoke breaks as a reason to walk away from a conversation and think about it, and he also likes the change of scenery (we're in the same industry and can work 16 hour days for weeks at a time). I've seen suggestions like a ""craving bag"" of candies, gum, etc. I personally know many folks who swear by breathing through a straw, but he thinks it's stupid and I'm not sure he can be convinced otherwise, ha.

Also, aside from tips and tricks, what's the language that can help? I really don't want to pressure him, but of course I naturally want to help remind him to stay on track. I'm worried my ""keep at it"" attitude could stress/annoy him into wanting a cigarette more. What's the least aggravating way to provide support?

Anyway, what I have so far is to make kinda three lists: Reasons to stop smoking and its benefits, reasons why he wants to smoke, and things to do instead of that last list. I'm hoping having something to look at on paper can be a good reminder and such.

I was late twenties. That was a wake up punch. I wasn't in the hospital related to respiratory issues, just pre operation testing.

2)  An old man I know quit too, after I guess 50 years of smoking. Him quitting didn't mean much to me, but the way he did it. He said: **You can't think of stopping smoking as ""NEVER smoking again"", you can only think of it as ""you are not smoking NOW"". That is the key attitude in stopping smoking.**

That was brilliant. It is infinitely less burden, less draining, less of a mental weight to think of it as just not smoking this moment. Just this moment, not today, this hour or anything. Just NOW. The never smoking again path/attitude is such a pain, its like carrying a chain with you at all times, it is unsustainable. Imagine forbidding yourself from doing anything ever again, its a horrible feeling.  Its also depressing as shit.

Imagine when you are badly tempted, one of those moments where everything seems meaningless if you just don't light just one sweet cigarette and puff away all of the turmoil. In those moments, if you go by Never mindset, you say to yourself, No no no no, and fight your urges. Excruciatingly. Such a waste of energy. Such anguish. Beating yourself up by yourself. Impossible. And when you exhaust yourself you of course succumb. 

Now imagine the opposite. You get in that hole of despair and you tell yourself, okay in five minutes I'll have one. What happens is that your body calms because all of the craving parts of you have a resolution. They will get what they want in just a few minutes.  No fight with yourself, no mental push/pull. And urges last less than five minutes, which is convenient :), and also lose power over time and ultimately go away. When I stopped I carried a pack of smokes with me for couple of months, just so whenever I had a desire to smoke, I could say to myself; okay, in five minutes I will light up one. No fear, cigarettes are in my pocket and only minutes away from my mouth and my lungs. And in five minutes, I didn't want one anymore, actually I wouldn't even think of it anymore. Please try it. It sounds way too simple but it effing works. 

3) Last is a little mental rewrite. **Cigarettes are not calming, sedating or in any way helping you relax.** They are relaxing your physical addiction to cigarettes. You didn't need them before you started doing them. You smoke, get addicted, crave them, craving makes you uneasy, you smoke them, you relax the craving, some time passes, you crave again... They are not friends. 

&#x200B;

That is all folks, this worked for me. I tried never again attitude many times  and trust me, this one worked.",44

I (23M) have been a smoker for 5 years until an hour ago. I smoked between 1.5-2.5 packets a day.
I have trying to quit for quite some time now and have been failing miserably. Smoking something that I hate for so long and the constant failures have given me depression and tanked my self confidence. It’s not that I enjoy smoking, in fact, with every passing day I hate it more. 
This depression has impacted other areas of my life: my career is going down hill because I can’t focus and have zero motivation, I have been out of touch with my  friends. I am trying to spend less and less time with girlfriend, I have stopped working out and I don’t know if it really is because of failing to quit smoking but that’s the only plausible culprit in my mind. 

I am making one last attempt at quitting smoking, if I fail I will make peace with this addiction and accept what it entails. But I have promised myself I won’t go down without a fight. I have always failed not because of crazy compulsion but because I convince myself that one more won’t hurt. Now I am thinking if cigarette is really as bad as I make it out to be, then I shouldn’t even try one more.

I've always struggled with my self image and with agoraphobia, and smoking was my coping mechanism and my way to elevate myself to the standard of people around me. In my culture (Italian) it is a very social thing and the feeling that it's cool/transgressive is still moderately strong among young people.

Now I've moved to a country where smoking is way more frowned upon, but I still can't get rid of this feeling that I will look like a loser if I don't start rolling up a cigarette every time I leave a building, or have one in my hand as I walk to my workplace.

Hello 

I desperately need your opinions on something I have been struggling with. 

I am a non-smoker and my girlfriend is a smoker. She has been smoking 10 cigarettes a day for about 15 years. 

After months of dating we have decided to move forward with our relationship and introduce each other to family, as her family is visiting town in November. I told her I was not okay with her being a smoker when we spoke about this and she immediately agreed she wanted to quit. 

For her first attempt, we did a “sober July” on which she quit cigarettes cold turkey, and we both quit drinking for the entire month. It was tough for her, especially the first week or so. I did notice she seemed a bit less energetic and a bit more lethargic. I tried my best to fill in our free time with healthy activities like hiking and going for walks and remained supportive and upbeat. 

She fell off the wagon in September during a particularly tough month at work and has been smoking ever since. She called her doctor and got prescribed Chantix, but there is currently a Chantix recall, meaning that is not an option right now. 

She talks about wanting to quit before November when her family comes but I am struggling to see how. Without the Chantix I am nervous about her falling off the boat, as the first few weeks of nicotine withdrawal are insanely tough. Additionally, it seems like her triggers are coffee, drinking, and stress. She is not a heavy drinker so we both have decided to avoid bars as much as possible. With that being said, coffee goes hand in hand with cigarettes and she once spoke about getting her caffeine intake in another fashion. However, she is talking about buying a new coffee maker which is a bit confusing to me. I’m nervous as I don’t see her quitting while she continues to drink coffee. 

I have suggested exercise as a replacement, but she does not seem too eager to take that on right now. 

I don’t feel comfortable moving forward with the relationship if she continues to smoke. We have talked about this issue and she knows the cigarettes need to go, but I am struggling to see how when Chantix is not available, there is a new coffee maker in the house, and exercise is not a priority. I’m not trying to tell her what to do, but I do not feel comfortable getting serious with someone who smokes regularly. Should I have another conversation about this? Should I trust her to quit and just be supportive? What would help us both be on the same page here?

I am unfamiliar with nicotine addiction so any opinions or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all!

&#x200B;

TLDR: My girlfriend agreed to quit smoking, quit, then resumed smoking. She wants to quit but is struggling. I am not comfortable moving forward with the relationship if she continues to smoke. What can I do to help her.",1

No more hugging my kid and wondering if he'll remember me smelling like an ash tray (or the imagery of me smoking). No more jeopardizing my future for myself and as a parent! No more heavy trash feelings in my chest. No more settling to solve my agitation with a cigarette. No more mental time clocks that now I should smoke because I haven't in a few hours even if I don't even want one, but smoking anyways. No more romanticizing that being a smoker is the way to be social, (like it's some testament to being a jaded philosophical artist of some sort). No more stained teeth. No more feeling shameful when I smoke and having to walk extra far away from nonsmokers to have a cigarette. No more wasting money.

In the last month i started  to ask myself if i am an addict. First try to quit was bad. I was felling tinglig in my toes and becouse i was very anxious i stared fearing that i had ALS and after that i started smoking again. Now i am 2 weeks in and i swear i will never pick up smoking again. The withdrawal is horrible . First week my anxiety was ten time worst then the first time i tried quiting. I had heart problems related to anxiety and i was telling myself i was going to die. Now after 2 weeks my anxiety calmed down a bit and my heart rate is back to normal. Sometimes i have headaches and anxiety bursts ( most of them centered around my health) but i know they will pass . This sub helped me a lot geting through the first week.

Im smoke free for 1 week now, and its surprisingly easy. I was a smoker for 14 years. I used patches for the first 3 days, and then nothing. I dont even think of cigarettes at all tbh, but i have one or two cravings per day, but not that intense. The main reason i stopped smoking now (i planned stopping for a while, i reall hated it) that ive been to spain for two weeks now, amd smoking is forbidden everywhere, so if i wanted to smoke i had to stand up, walk away and smoke at the street instead of the bar, or restaurant, and i found that very disturbing and socially stigmatized. I couldnt even smoke at the airport on my way back, although i had to get there 3 hours before take off, so that was a test itself.
Since then i run every day, today i ran 5K and my lungs are amazing now, its more clear already, so if you plan to give up smokeing do it!!",14

2021-09-21 09:18:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/psikjz/3_weeks_today/,3 weeks today!,"I always thought quitting smoking would be impossible for me - I smoked for 20 years (the majority of my life), when I quit I was smoking about 12 a day. 

What helped me quit:

Well first of all, some person on this sub wrote a comment about a quiz to see if you are ready to quit on this app QuitSure. I downloaded the app to take this quiz and well, guess I was ready because 10 days later I smoked my last cigarette. So thanks random commenter, you and this creepy app literally saved my life. 

Seriously I can not recommend QuitSure enough and no, I'm not here for promo. It's free. It works. I've had few to no cravings since I quit, though a few fleeting urges especially the first few days. 
 
Other things that helped: flexible working hours so I could get up and run around the block/do yoga/meditate as needed. My jump rope was crucial the first week. I stopped coffee for 2 weeks and switched to tea and yoga in the morning. The entire Sia discography got me through some rough moments - I swear every Sia song is about quitting smoking. And CBD - the first 4 days I smoked 1 or 2 CBD cigarettes and I still smoke it with some weed as I used to roll joints with tobacco. Yes, the weed has helped too. 

Also I have been alone this entire time - we are moving and my spouse is already in the new house while I stay to pack and finish work. The isolation has been helpful as no triggers (spouse still smokes) and when I was going through the bowels of hell known as Day 3 no one was here to make me even crankier. 

The changes I've noticed:

First week - insane brain fog, I was completely useless but other than that felt super empowered and confident with myself. Worked out basically all day - yoga, pilates, running, jump rope. Got some quit zits. Had no appetite so just ate fruit and nuts and olives and juice and digestion was OK.  

Week 2 - super constipated which wasn't so much of an issue week 1. Got some depression but I'm bipolar so was expecting much worse (mood has been pretty hypomanic otherwise, but honestly I think the hypo helped me quit).  Then came the hemorrhoids and eczema. My gums and lips got super sore and started cracking and swelling. Body got warmer which is weird but I'm less cold now. Skin started glowing. Exercise and breathing much easier. Hacking up brown stuff too but was actually pretty satisfying.

Week 3 - still constipated, laxatives for breakfast every day. Started coffee again but still no alcohol. Mood stable and can run 10 minutes now! Eczema going away but some blood when I blow my nose. Lips and gums way better. Concentration slowly returning...and feeling proud AF. 


The best for me was QuitSure, exercise, and CBD as needed. I'll probably bring the CBD with me to parties as drinking is when I usually cave. It also really helped with relaxation and sleep. 

I hope I'm able to help someone on this sub quit as one of you did for me. Good job everyone that has done it :) And if you haven't yet, download QuitSure and check out that module to see if you're ready...",5

Please excuse any formatting issues, while I am not new to lurking here, I am to posting.

So, ten years of smoking. Started off in college while drinking - always bumming smokes and never buying any (super annoying to all the smokers out there, yes).  After college...bigger jobs, bigger relationships, bigger problems...more smoking.

I have had the opportunity to work all over the world with my career and also the honour of paying the wildly different waccy tabbacy prices along the way. Didn't matter if it was $5 in California (10 years ago?) or $30 in Adelaide (not so long ago....), I always paid. Im now in Canada and dutifully shell out $18 - at least 3/4 times a week- before to the nice lady at the Chevron down the street. 

Now let talk about the lighters. THE LIGHTERS. Im sure Ive spent $1000 on shitty bic lighters of all colours in my in lifetime. Half of which my washing machine ate and the other half of which can no longer be accounted for. Gone forever. RIP.

SO, 7 days, 12 hours and 35 minutes without a shitty cig at this point.

Now, to be fair, I have taken to a vape like a baby does a soother....but its a step for me. Good luck out there guys and gals.",14

2021-09-20 18:48:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/ps5qz2/turned_out_quitting_is_insanely_easy/,Turned out quitting is insanely easy,"I've been taking nicotine in various forms for the past 8 years. First 5 years - cigarettes, 5th-7th year - vape with occasional cigs, past year - glo. Averaging at around 15 cigs per day. I'm male, 28 and have an addictive personality.

It's been over 3 days and it goes paradoxically fine. No urges, no cravings, no nothing. Granted, I was eating a lot this weekend, was figuratively raping my fridge all the day long like there is no tomorrow.
Also, I feel that my temper is now as short as my pp, every single thing around triggers some primal rage in me and I believe I have some problems concentrating while doing some work.

But with all of that I feel a lot of energy, confidence, motivation and sometimes pure euphoria and bliss that outweighs the negatives.
And the most important thing is that deep inside I honestly don't feel the need for the cig. I mean I do realize that nicotine will lift some of those withdrawal symptoms but somehow I don't even feel the need to rationalize that smoking a cig will be only temporal solution. I genuinely don't feel the need for the nicotine.

What's interesting, I've already tried quitting. In contrast to the story above, I went cold turkey for half a year about 3 years ago. First two weeks were pure hell, every night getting myself to sleep was a challenge, I was not just sweating, I was melting in my bed, with my hands shaking, and for every damn second my mind was occupied with the one and only thought - ""I cannot do this any longer, I have to find some cigs.""

For some reason, second attempt is going much smoother. Maybe, that's because I mostly switched from cigs to vape/glo, but I felt no discomfort upon switching, had no withdrawals. So at that time I assumed vape/glo won't help me with quitting as the nicotine intake remained the same.

I also had several trips on acid in which I had a thought that's it's time to stop smoking. Well, not just a thought, a complete serious internal conversation, how pretentious wouldn't that sound. There are some cases you can find in the internet where LSD made a huge impact in battling addiction, mostly alcohol. Maybe it worked for me either.

Anyway, I'm feeling uplifted so I wanted to share this one with you. Thanks for reading.

Edit: Day 4. Fatigue, cough, low temperature photophobia. I got really stressed a couple of times yesterday, maybe that weakened my immune system. Still no cravings though.",9

I've tried vaping, and some days I can get by with just vaping, but others I'll go out and buy cigarettes. I really hate vaping too, and don't want to do that either. 

The thing is, I'm so mad at myself. I quit this habit several years ago and it was extremely difficult. I want to stop but I just end up going out and buying another pack. No one knows I've started and I want to stop before anyone finds out. 

The general shitty feeling I have about starting smoking again almost makes me want to smoke more - I'm stressed about starting smoking so I smoke to attempt to relieve that stress. 

It never works. I wish I could stop. I'm so angry at myself. I have mental health issues and that makes it even more difficult. 

Beating myself up over this is not helping. If I knew I could quit whenever I wanted I'd feel better. The problem is I don't know if I will be able to.

We all are aware of the setbacks of smoking, but that does not make it easier for anyone to quit it. People often try to quit smoking but are unable to manage! If you are one of those people, then don’t lose hope. Look back on your past behavior and think what steps you are going to take this time.  


**Tips To Quit Smoking**   
Are you ready to give up on your habit? Follow these tips to help yourself quit smoking for good:  


**Find Your Motivation**  
In order to succeed, you need powerful reasons to quit. Take a paper and write down the reasons you can think of to quit. Choosing the right reasons can decrease your urge to light up the cigarette.  
**Make a Plan**  
Smoking is an addiction that you can not quit without making a plan. You feel withdrawal symptoms that will make you crave a drag. Ask your doctor to prescribe you medicines or suggest a counseling session to help you with the journey.  


**Avoid Your Trigger**  
Think of the things or situations that trigger your smoking habit and try your best to avoid them. It might be a party or hanging out with certain friends; try to find your escape route. If such situations trigger your habit, then try leaving the place for 1 minute.  


**Practice Relaxation Techniques**  
Quitting smoking is not easy; you have to go through the stress that makes it hard to stop. For this, you can practice various relaxation techniques. When the craving hits, you take a deep breath and take a journey in your mind.  


[**Free stop smoking clinic Streatham**](https://www.pearlchemistgroup.co.uk/services/stop-smoking/) can help you take off your stress by practicing mindfulness that can help you cope with your craving and depression.   
**Key Takeaway**  
Keep in mind that a delay in quitting will put your health further at risk. If you want to quit, then start now. Looking for stop smoking services in Mitcham seems like a good idea if you’re going to quit for good. These services can help you with your journey to quit smoking.  


When you are going through withdrawal symptoms, you need someone to support you and tell you that it is just a stage that’ll pass. A little support can make a huge difference in this sensitive journey.",1

2021-09-19 23:08:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/prmfiy/maybe_a_helpful_trick_eat_more_vegetables/,Maybe a Helpful Trick: Eat More Vegetables,"So, hear me out: when I started my quit one week ago, I'd already been trying to quit for a week+. Around the same time I also went back to eating whole food plant based. Without getting on a soap-box, I eat plants with as little processing as possible, high starch, high fiber, low fat and low salt, no refined oils or sugars. I think this has **REALLY** helped me a quit, and here's why:

° This way of eating gets you hydrated -- eating meat and meat by-products will dehydrate you, not to mention all the salt. Water helps flush out residual nicotine and supports **ALL** those  bodily systems smoking has punished all these years -- plus, staying hydrated just makes you feel better overall

° The standard American diet is full of oils, sodium and sugar that (yes, will dehydrate you,  but also!) push your dopamine receptors like they were buttons on a game controller, which will ignite your cigarette cravings. Eating this way doesn't give you that same sensation and, for me, seemed to help abate the intensity of the post-meal craving.   
(Side-note: devious nicotine addiction 'knows' that our bodies' digestive absorption rates sky rocket post-meal, allowing more of the cigarette to be absorbed quicker -- supposedly, one after meal cigarette is worse than smoking 10 cigarettes).

° Finally, it'll help the healing process while giving you confidence.  Eating this way gives your body a ton of nutrient dense foods rather than calorie dense foods, so your body gets what it needs (helping it heal). And honestly, it'd be really hard to gain weight while eating this way. In fact my first week I lost five pounds just eating potatoes, rice, veggies, fruit, and beans. That really gave me a nice confidence boost during the times I was feeling weak or just down on myself. 

Even if you don't change your whole diet, I would bet just eating more veggies and fruits and less meat and fats would really help you deal with the first few weeks of stopping. 

I hope this helps! Good luck and stick to the stop!",28

My body smells disgusting though. It’s like I can smell the detox coming out of my skin.

All day today I’ve only sucked on 2 nicotine lozenges and I’m making sure to use them as sparingly as possible.

Internally I’m a bit of a mess. I keep thinking about painful life experiences, some recent and some from years ago. But overall it’s good to have some sort of feelings again because I was always just numbing myself out by puffing away instead of dealing with anything.

I’m lucky that I’m in a situation where I can afford to just focus on quitting and not focus on anything else.

I’m going for insanely long walks because I just feel restless. Exploring the area. Mostly keeping to myself.

I’m also a lot more down with the “never take another puff” mentality now. Which is great. That way I’ll be less likely to fall for those sneaky thoughts.

Last three weeks have been up and down.

Also social interactions have become a huge burden, as my buddies birthday was this weekend but just did not have the energy or desire to go and talk to people. Definitely have felt a separation from my best friends and girlfriend but know it’s my nicotine withdrawn poisoned mind. Without this subreddit my journey would be impossible. This page showed me how many people have gone through this same thing and the advice has been invaluable. Thanks so much everyone here’s so hoping I won’t have to reset my timer!",18

2021-09-19 11:27:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pra12j/havent_smoked_in_eight_months_now/,Haven't smoked in eight months now,"I don't miss it, and don't even remember I used to smoke unless it comes up somehow. 

My best advice is to keep trying and don't give up no matter how many times you ""fail"" at quitting. I switched from buying packs to rolling my own sometime late last year, and I threw away my rolling supplies upwards of 5 times before I quit for good; and I don't regret it. I might have wasted a lot of money re-buying the rolling supplies when I caved, but it worked as extra incentive to kick the habit because after the 3rd time it's impossible to ignore how absurd this addiction yo-yo is. 

Be kind to yourself, even when you mess up. Note all the little signs of progress, including the way you're thinking about smoking and quitting. A lot of the time, the way you're mentally framing smoking and quitting is more important. 

The biggest thing for me was just accepting I was going to be more miserable for a while. And that's hard to accept when life is a struggle already. But just going in knowing that quitting is going to lead to moodiness, headaches, stress, brain fog, and tiredness helped me to handle all those things. 

Initially, I was so *scared* of the effects of quitting that I didn't want to try it. But once I just embraced the idea, like ""yeah I am just going to be less-than-peak for a couple weeks,"" things got a lot better. It meant my expectations for myself in any given situation needed to be different while I was quitting. I couldn't expect myself to be at 100% during the withdrawl period, so I didn't. I went to work and gave it everything I had...considering my brain felt like it was buried under 10 layers of cotton. I napped a *lot* because sleeping was just better than being awake. I went for a lot of walks because aerobic exercise helped with the stress and the headaches. When I ate fast food as a coping mechanism I didn't beat myself up over it, just took time to notice how upset it made my stomach and acknowledged it really only added to my list of general ills.

Overall I just tried to be really kind to my body. That was hard for me, as obviously smoking is quite *unkind* to the body and I had to confront and acknowledge just how much I'd been physically harming myself with smoking, as well as realize that for various reasons I personally struggle with being kind to myself. So that was something I needed to learn, and a mental muscle I needed to exercise. Just a normal level of decency to ones own flesh--what does that look like? What do I want that to look like? How does that *feel*, in my body? 

I treated quitting as a physiological and psychological process with actionable steps and obtainable goals. I studied the physical effects of nicotine withdrawal and mentally prepared for the effects and their timelines. I used an app that tracked what my blood and lungs and heart were experiencing without cigarettes (quittracker, but there's tons of others). Knowing the science-facts about what was happening to me physiologically helped reassure me that no matter what I was experiencing in my head, this was normal as a reaction to quitting and I needed to keep it in perspective that it wasn't a permanent change to my experience of existing. 


I didn't titrate down or use assistance drugs or slowly taper my use; I just quit cold turkey over and over again until it stuck, and in the meantime I tried to work on habits of kindness towards myself--both in my thinking and in my behavior. As I exercised my self-kindness/compassion muscles, I was more readily able to face the symptoms of withdrawl and grind through the 2 weeks of symptoms and 4 weeks of habit building necessary to enforce a lasting change. 

So to anyone else working to quit, good luck and be kind to yourself. It's hard and you deserve compassion no matter what part of the journey you're at. Remember that growth and progress are not linear but cyclical, and you've gained something new from each cycle you've gone through.",17

2021-09-19 10:10:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pr8n16/i_quit_smoking_8_years_ago_successfully_and_this/,I quit smoking 8 years ago (successfully) and this is what happened.,"I started smoking at the age of 14.  At first to catch a buzz with friends.  Within a year, I was at nearly a pack a day.  Eventually I got to a little over a pack a day and continued that way through my wife giving birth to 3 kids, and for the next 21 years of my life.  Eventually reached the point where I smoked more years of my life than not. In 2012 I tried quitting using Chantix.  Luckily it was covered under my insurance.  It seemed to do a decent enough job but gave me the weirdest dreams and some awful nightmares.  I never fully quit while taking Chantix and stopped taking it, which lead me to smoking full force again. At this point, it was more troublesome.  I didn't smoke in the car with my kids, so a car ride was something like this; Smoke just before getting the the car.  If the trip was under an hour, I would smoke as soon as we got to where we were going.  If it was longer, i would take a smoke break about every hour.  This left me smelling of smoke sometimes and making my wife car-sick from the smell and the motion of driving. It got to the point where I was concerned about cancer and what my future would be like and wondering if my kids would pick up the habit.  I tried to quit a couple more times without telling anyone, so that if I failed, only I would know.My buddy quit and went to vaping.  He tried to get me to vape, and that lasted maybe a couple months, but I still smoked actual cigarettes.  It didn't help me. One day, in June of 2013, I had just left Bo'Jangles for lunch.  As any smoker knows, you have to have a smoke right after eating.  As soon as I got in my truck, I fired up the after lunch cigarette.  I immediately got a headache and as I was sitting there, I could see the nicotine stains across my windshield from the glare of the sun.  I asked myself, ""Why am I still doing this?"" I took my cigarette, my pack, my lighter and tossed them all in the trash can.  I drove home, tossed my remaining carton in the trash, told my wife I was done smoking.  I went on FaceBook and announced that I was quitting.  That way I would be held accountable. The next 2-3 months were rough.  I kept trying to convince myself to just get one last pack.  Smoke one last cigarette. I started slicing carrots and celery and putting them in baggies to munch on when the impulse to smoke came on.  People often don't think about the 'hand-to-mouth' motion being habitual and a hard thing to drop.  So people often lead to excessive snacking as a coping mechanism. I made smoking my enemy this time.  Looked at is as an entity that was trying to kill me.  I hated it.  After about a year, the smell would turn my stomach.  I could smell the person in front of me at a stop light if they were smoking.  Going into stores where an employee had just gotten back from a smoke break.  That smell.  It was nauseating. For nearly 2 years I kept having dreams that I smoked or bought a pack and fired one up.  I would wake up angry thinking it really happened, then sigh in relief that it was just a dream. It has now been 8.5 years.  I have officially been a non-smoker longer than a smoker again.  I have been alive for 43 years and smoked only 21 of them.  It was oddly depressing to know that for about 7 years, I was a smoker longer than I was not.  Now, that has been reversed. My buddy who quit smoking by vaping, is still vaping.  After all these years.  Vaping as much as he did 8 years ago.  I am proud to say I haven't cracked.  Not even once.  Not even a puff, since I quit on June 12th, 2013.It's possible.  I'm not a man of great feats.  I have no super powers.  I am as average as they come.  If I can do it, I think you can do it.  It's hard.  It takes determination.  It is well worth it in the long run. I'm saving over $5 a day, which I've put toward a hobby.  I'm not passing down a terrible, life-altering habit to my kids.  My wife likes kissing me again (she never smoked).  I don't smell like an ashtray anymore.  My fingertips aren't yellow with nicotine stains anymore. If you're reading this, you're in the right place, trying to do the right thing.  You got this.  I believe in you!",365

As I went past my daily limit that I had set for myself, I understood that this is a killer substance to hold onto. Keeping the story until here. As I'm writing this after smoking the last bud in my packet, I've decided to take a break from this at least until Christmas. Where I live, it is not at all easy for a chap like me to sober up for even three months. It's easily available around and every medium glorifies the use of ciggerates here.

Really seeking some advice here. I've been a heavy tobacco smoker for roughly six years (I'm 25 now), and only in the past 7 weeks have I been exclusively on the vape (strength 18mg, chain-vaping all day). After deciding to give that one up a few days ago, the symptoms have been nothing short of debilitating...

Aside from the obvious discomfort, the main point of contention is these crazy mood swings I've never experienced before, and insomnia. I honestly hadn't cried in close to 10 years, until yesterday. Full on tears, blubbering, runny nose.  

I cannot for the life of me sleep. I am utterly restless and feel as though I'm always on the verge of tears. I'm crazy emotional right now and want to know when, or if, the mist should begin to clear. 

Really hoping that this isn't going to be my default state of mind from now on, because if it is and smoking was just suppressing these emotions, I would rather go back on them to be honest.

I need a reason to trudge on and I'm struggling to find one.

I quit all my other vices FIRST this time because usually me needing a substitute for smoking would cause all kinds of bad behaviour or replacements.

So this time I’m quitting and just coping through the withdrawal.

Now I can’t sleep though. I have a ton of energy, acid reflux, I’m feeling pain everywhere in my body…

The cigarette withdrawal has never been this bad before, maybe because I’d usually drink while quitting IDK.

I also feel emotional but also alive. I feel all sweaty and shaky on the outside and my skin is oily…but I also feel clean and energized which seems paradoxical because I also feel exhausted.

Rollercoaster!

I just hope this levels out sooner rather than later.

This time I’m also taking tons of vitamins and supplements as well as an acid reducer because I always get GERD when I’m quitting and I’m taking probiotics too because quitting normally gives me the runs for some reason.

I am sucking on nicotine lozenges as well but in moderation and I have to keep spitting them out anyway because they start to make me feel sick after about 5 minutes of sucking on them.

One thing that helped me was to name the various feelings, discomforts, and urges because what can be named can be understood. 

It helped to classify the different experiences into three camps: withdraws, cravings, suggestions. So, when I'd feel physical pressure in my head after a meal and my subconscious mind would push ""cigarette"" through my brain, I could dissect each different, smaller part and deal with them individually rather than as some monolithic monster.

For the last few days, the withdraws are mild,  cravings are getting more and more sparse, and the suggestions are inconsistent and weak.

However! Yesterday and today I've noticed a different kind of prompt, and I wonder if ya'll have had it too. This is clearly under the suggestion classification, but it's not overt. I find myself feeling like something is missing, something is not present and I feel incomplete. 

So, I have coffee but I'm not satisfied with it because it lacks something that leaves me feeling not-whole. The same with eating, driving, etc.

I notice it most when I'm not in the moment: when I'm just mindlessly consuming my coffee one giant slurp at a time. I'm going to try to be more mindful, to find the 'new things""  about my drinks, meals,  etc that smoking deprived me of noticing in order to combat this subtle suggestion that is disrupting my peace.

If you have felt this too or have an idea of how to face it, please let me know !

Hey guys. I have been smoking since I was 13, I am 18 now. In December 2019 I quit smoking and moved to snus, nicotine pouch. I hated myself for continuing the worst path; however, my craving was too strong. I always told myself when I move to Canada, I will quit as there is no snus here. I came to Canada and wasted what I had left of snus. I was ready. The first day without snus I got huge cravings and I was feeling sick. I tried to distract myself by smoking weed but it only made it worse. I became emotional and hysterical. I could not stop crying and having suicidal thoughts. Not having any friends in Canada did not help so I turned to the one thing I finally got rid of, cigarettes. I bought a pack and told myself it would be my last. It has been 6 days since I said that, I have smoked 5 and a half packs ever since. I need help, I fucking need it. What do I do? I am scared. I do not want to ruin my life and I do not want to smoke any more. I thought I was strong enough, it turns out I am a weak coward. 

I am not only addicted to the nicotine but to the fact that it was always my escape. 

  
It pulled me out from rough times and rough moments.

Me again. Former pack-a-day smoker. Managed to quit for somewhere around 50 days in 2019, blew it on some stupid nonsense, but I'm ready this time. I'm ready for real. I've been excited for every leg down in nicotine. 

I'm pacing myself to give myself the best chance I can, but I refuse to fail. 

But now at 1.5mg vape juice, I'm at the bottom of the ladder. From here it's one small step for man, a giant leap for not dying of preventable disease. 

It's weird how it all works out, but a few weeks ago I saw a meme on here from a guy who said he got lung cancer and it clicked again for me that I've been playing with fire. 

I'm ready to be done with this, I'm ready to stop romaniticizing smoking and making it a part of my personality. I'm going to hit 0mg, throw the vape away, hit the exercise bike and turn this shit around.

Anyway, thought y'all would like to know. But excited to join the legion of non-smokers, and non-vapers very soon.",23

i was sitting there with a friend of mine, convinced i wouldnt get myself a beer, thinking to myself what the fuck am i doing here:

Im young, in university, friends are around and places are opening up again.

and im here, the most boring person at the location, judging people for having fun.

one beer led to another and irresitable cravings took over me and i got myself a cigarette from someone. 

and another one.

and we lit up a hookah.

it was so much fun being back with friends. this evening was so much needed.

all good i thought. not a big deal. i treated myself once. i have deserved this.

a friend of mine invited me for the next day to go drinking.
hell yeah i thought. i was craving social connection so badly.

humans need social connection. i dont think its healthy to life in total abstinence. always 'husteling'

would have been real fucking valuable for me to hustle on because of so much wasted time in my teens due to some problemes and a huge problem with substance absue.

i was on such a successful way.

but this is still not the point were it got problematic again.

the next day comes around. met with my friend and a few others. drank some beery some harder stuff and my smoking totally escalated that night.

asked one stranger after the other for a cigarette. anybody i could find to ask. didnt even look them in the eyes anymore only on there hands if their holding one.

still this isnt the point where it got problematic.

what really got problematic is that i crossed the barrier of lighting my hookah up at my place every possible second while at home ever since.

its even at that point again where i think to myself that i dont want it, i get headaches, my lungs hurt and i dont get shit done but my stupid addicted brain only needs like 5 minutes to change its mind and i prepare another head.

so...

i feel bad. not too bad bit i know what im doing is not good at all.

i think the biggest problem is that i dont hate i enough to see the bad side of it yet.

nicotine addiction got its grip back on me in less than 2 days.

i know what it feels like. the mental aspect of not wanting it but still doing it and the physical sensation of nicotine withdrawl.

its back

tomorrow im back awake, and my mind is gonna trick me into consuming again.

i know none of your comments will stop me from doing so. only i can stop myself.

the reason i consume is because i cant stand be be left alone with my thoughts when i know theres something more pleasurable whitch distracts me from my pain.

but i will embrace the pain. i love pain.

pain makes a man

i pushes me forward to new hights.

to reach impossible achievements and no fucking stupid useless substance is gonna stop me from doing so.

i want more from live than numbing pain with substances and being chained to my addiction.

i got a new therapist with whom i hopefully be able to work with successfully.

as much as i wish luck to myself i do wish it for you.

this is gonna be hard again but i will overfome this annoying sensation of withdrawl.

mostly need to work on how to connect with other young people without consuming. but its everywhere and im so fucking lonely and unhappy about how hard it is to spend time with other young people and not consume any kind of substance. feel like im missing out of so much fun only to realise the night out was totally annoying and not fun and i have to spend a whole day hungover and a full week tired and waste time and so on. i want to build value now i harvest my compound interest achievements in the future. hopefully i will be able to do so.",14

The first month was rough and I was irritable and anxious all the time, made it feel like I wouldn't get past it. But as time went on it did get easier for some time, even past the 6 month streak I was pretty amazed with myself and surprised that I had made it that long. 

Around a month ago I started struggling with anxiety on a more regular basis. I lost my job in July and I started taking some online classes a couple weeks ago but during that period between not working and not occupying my time with anything I started to feel the urge to go back to smoking really bad. I've struggled with bouts of anxiety before and usually when I did, the cigarettes were always there for me. Being a smoker for 10+ years they felt like they became a part of my identity. It always felt like a crutch that could ground me and bring me back to reality when I was having excessive worry or intrusive thoughts. 

Dealing with my anxiety this time around has been more sobering and difficult because I now always have the thought in my mind that I should just go buy a pack and start smoking, to see if that helps. There's other things I find myself doing that I didn't feel necessary when I started quitting like chewing more gum or putting a toothpick in my mouth. Sometimes I'll just go out on the porch and pretend like I'm smoking but just get some air instead. I'll even act like I'm holding a cigarette sometimes. 

It's weird to think about how ingrained that behavior of smoking became even though it's been almost a year since I had one, it's just lately I've been doing a lot of reminiscing on the times I was a smoker. I know it's a big illusion that the addiction created but it really feels like a part of me is gone with the cigarettes out of my life. Anyway, just wanted to rant about this for a bit and see if anyone had any similar thoughts or experiences to share. Good luck everyone and wishing you all the best.",11

I've seen too many lung cancer patients coughing up blood and moaning in pain as they die a slow and painful death. I've seen to much judgement in the eyes of my fellow employees as they walk by me sucking down cigarettes, too many people have looked at me like I'm some sort of scum for doing it. I'm done letting this chemical have any sort of hold over me. I'm tired of feeling like a crazy person when I don't get a cigarette in every four hours. 

I've been smoke free, cold turkey for about 6.5 days now. I already feel like I can breathe better. I can taste food and coffee again. I can smell my own farts again. So far the biggest symptom has been that I feel less in control of my emotions. Maybe this is how I felt before I started smoking, and I was using nicotine to treat that in a way. I don't remember. Regardless, I am glad that my meds have enabled me to do this with minimal physical withdrawal symptoms after the first two days, besides my inability to sleep.

I'm also proud of myself, especially after today. I had to drive for 3+ hours today, and every part of me wanted to buy a pack of cigarettes before I left my home town. I found myself trying to rationalize it. ""Well, maybe I can make a rule where I only smoke when I have a long car trip, "" ""I'll throw the pack away when I get home""  but luckily I stopped myself. Instead, I bought a pack of gum. I don't know why I'm posting this, mostly to share my success.

If I continue to chew I eventually feel an itchy burning sensation in my mouth that reminds me of getting vape juice directly in my mouth. I assume this is too much nicotine causing irritation. The directions also say to not swallow the saliva while chewing the gum, so should I be spitting every 30 seconds? Do I need to go out and buy a spittoon? Is it possible my mouth produces too much saliva and as such the gum and lozenge will not work for me?

I tell myself every night before going to sleep that I'll quit the next day or at least reduce the number of cigarettes smoked but when I wake up the urge is strong. I'm tired of it and on the other hand I'm somehow used to being addicted and not doing anything all day but thinking about smoking and smoking. I could spend all day just listening to music while having a cigarette. 

Sometimes my teeth hurt and when I wake up in the morning or during the night to go to bathroom ( I'm 22 and I have the urge to pee almost every night or morning , might be because of cigarettes but I'm not sure ) sometimes I cough. Sometimes my ribs hurt.

Something's not quite right with me. I need help.

Thought I'd just share with you what I did - I kept the pack of tobacco on the coffee table right in front of me, and every time I had a craving I said to myself ""I can have it anytime, but in this very moment I am choosing not to have one, because if I have one now then this will lead to another (it always does) and I will be a smoker for the rest of my life"" and imagined myself 20 years down the line, old and nicotine stained and sick Vs 20 years down the line happy and healthy. 

I think keeping the stuff within sight so I could consciously think about it and say no to it over and over again was very empowering and allowed me to build up that ability to say no. I smoked for about 16 years overall and in all previous attempts I would say ""ok, I'm never smoking again"", throw the stuff in the bin, and just try to distract myself. It always ended up in my fishing it back out of the bin.",6

It is still hard. At 24, I was a smoker for longer than i wasn’t. And i loved it. For so long. But I’ve seen the reflection when I’m looking for them, the crazy eyes, the frantic movements, the irritability, the horrid feeling when you realise it is late, you’re out of them and everything is closed. The lengths one goes to. The wet hair smelling like death because you *had* to have one. The shitty excuses to leave, that everyone can see through. The burned clothes. The health damage. The subhumanity. It’s literally just cigarettes. It takes about 20 days to be out of the worst. I’m out of the worst. It is literally just a habitual cancer stick, and I want to quit using them forever. It is a damn no brainer.

2021-09-16 20:44:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pppuir/nicotine_replacement_vs_cold_turkey/,Nicotine replacement vs cold turkey,"I've tried to quit cold turkey in the past so many times. Buying a pack, smoking two or three, then throwing the pack and the lighter away. Going off the advice of Allen Carr, I was determined to just rip out that nicotine drip. But I kept coming back.

This might work for some people. But what I realised after trying and failing literally maybe 20 times was that I was sick of the *sensation* of smoking but not the nicotine. The need for a nicotine was the only thing bringing me back.

So I finally dropped a load of money (up-front) on a full course of nicotine patches plus gum. I thought of it as an investment that would save me so much money in the long run if it works.

I'm now five days in and haven't *once* wanted to smoke. Yesterday I even took the patch off for about 12 hours and still didn't want to smoke. Once the familiar 'pinched' feeling came (again, for a *nicotine* hit, not for smoke in my lungs), I slapped on another patch. The thought of smoking made me feel physically sick.

Here's my point: it's easy to think you're strong enough to quit cold turkey. I kept kidding myself that I could tackle both the psychological and physical addiction at once. But actually I needed to get used to a smoke-free life.

I'm already feeling the benefits. I can breathe better. I smell good. I can smell *things* (it was actually kind of an emotional, Proustian moment to walk into a supermarket on day 3 and actually *smell* the fruit and veg aisle). There are no longer dark rings under my eyes. I have more time. I'm happier. 

Without the nicotine cravings I can see the cigarettes for what they actually are - a filthy transmission method for a highly addictive substance.

Even if I'm still popping nicotine gum in the months, even years ahead, it's a much better option than actively poisoning myself. The reason that NRT is twice as effective is because it allows you to tackle the addiction by degrees. For all the good that the cold turkey method is supposed to do, I feel like the all-or-nothing approach isn't for everyone. Like any big problem, it can help to take it in smaller bites. At least, it seems to be working for me.",60

My first puff was when I was five but I didn't start smoking full time until I was in my teens.  I'd never been smoke free in any way until I quit in January 2018 and I did it cold turkey with no support network of any kind and I was around smokers, and it was the easiest attempt I'd ever made.  


Now I'm that annoying person who says *If I can do it, anyone can.*  


If you've tried quitting you probably already know a lot of these thing but they don't click or you don't care. We know it's bad. It can kill us (don't care). It's a drain on finances (so what). Here's one you already know but don't fully appreciate the extent of it yet.

You stink. I mean you really F'n stink. That ashtray you have outside that you wash very rarely. That's is how you smell to others all the time. Even now I occasionally get a slight whiff coming from my carpets despite never having smoked inside and having deep cleaned them repeatedly. I feel physically sick when I do. Brushing your teeth constantly and spraying perfume and deodorant work no more than they do in a toilet. Now you just smell stupid. Once you are smoke free, you will immediately think back to all those non-smoker friends/family/partners/exes and wonder how they tolerated it. You stink so much more than you realise.   


&#x200B;

You'll watch Youtube videos and read posts like these in forums and get that spurt of motivation which then dwindles.  You want to quit but it seems too hard or you really can't be bothered. If you're like I was, you're probably smoking as you read this.  When I say put it out, ditch your smokes and become a non smoker right now, you might want to but probably won't but it's really as simple as that.  You're a non smoker until you smoke again. There's no such thing as ""quitting"" or  ""cutting down"".  
You have everything you need to quit right now. There is no easier time or date or setting. Stopping right now is the biggest advantage you can give yourself as it is about doing new things and breaking your old habits. Quitting later is your old habit and this is the first thing you need to change. Stop deluding yourself and clinging onto things you think will make it easier as they only make it harder.

Don't set a time to start quitting, don't cut down, don't try weaning yourself off with gum and patches. It's the slow bandaid but it does work for some, however, a little statistic based on *my* own experience and people *I* personally know is that 100% of those people who relapsed after quitting were on gum/patches/nic vape and 100% of those who have successfully quit never touched them and also changed their surroundings to help break their habits. 

Quitting isn't about stopping an addiction, it's mostly about breaking a habit which has slowly changed you without you realising it.  You need to reclaim and retrain your brain. Nicotine is completely out your system in around five days or so and no matter what you think your body is telling you, you no longer have a physical addiction. You don't *need* it, you just think you do. The more you feel like you want to smoke and the stronger the urge, the closer you actually are of being completely free of it. It's the nictone death thrall. When you're getting closer to being free of it, it's the nicotine itself **not** the lack of nicotine that makes you feel crap without it in order for it to survive in your body. Once you understand this, it's easy to push through the urges as it's a sign that you are succeeding not a sign that you're dependant on it.  

You probably already know this too. Maybe you have quit and are a few days or weeks in, so here is something else I've said before to people -  changing the things you see every day help just as much, sometimes more, as changing what you do every day.  It's not just about taking a new route to work, or trying a different supermarket or taking up new habits like exercise or drinking water.   


Something as simple as changing your phone wallpaper is a good start. Don't go back to one you liked before, get something new, something different. Perhaps try something you don't particularly like as you need to get yourself out of your old mould. 

Rearrange your furniture! Change your curtains! Use a new dining set, rearrange the pictures you may have on display around the home, reverse your bedroom layout and change your quilt covers. Rearrange or replace your fridge magnets, listen to music you would never listen to, buy a brand of food you usually don't buy, stop at that shop you pass by every day, buy a new mop, switch which drawer your clothes are in or better yet, do a big cleanout... No matter how small it is, no matter how trivial even if it's something you don't realise you notice, somewhere deep down in the recesses of your mind, you have noticed it and this little change goes towards rewiring your mind.   


Look at how much it costs you to smoke per week, then look at something that costs the same. If you were thinking of taking up a new hobby, now is the time to start as you can afford it. Put your money towards your new passion.   Just like your stench, you probably don't realise how much money you are burning. When I quit, for the first few weeks/months I would use my ""smoking money"" to reward myself with something new each week. Sometimes saving up a few weeks and getting something big. I would start buying new things to slowly replace what I already had so I was seeing new things every day which changed my mentality and attitude. Got a new kettle, okay, I'll try a new brand of coffee, new coffee? Okay, new mug. One little thing opens up the path for another little thing. It snowballs. 

One day I was driving to the local shop for full cream milk for one of the seven coffees a day I was making with my new kettle, the next thing I was walking there and buying light milk purely because it has a different label to the one I was used to seeing (these little things really do help) to make one of the two coffees a day I now drank. I went from two teaspoons of sugar to half a teaspoon and I wasn't even trying to cut down or be healthy as it just happened once I started to change little things I saw every day around my home. It *all* snowballs.

However, there's also the health thing we all know about. I knew but I didn't care.  I developed lung problems six months after I quit. Who knows, I might yet develop cancer down the track but at least I don't have these problems while still trying to quit while burning money. It was actually the money that drove me to quit and it was having new things and fresh scenery that kept me off it. I only really struggled the first five days but it was nothing like it had been the 3464315 attempts beforehand. This time it was different as I just stopped and saw nicotine as the little bastard it is. I also hated being a slave to my smoking schedule and also the stigma of having society now ranking me below junkies as they are ""victims"" and smokers are apparently just ""selfish c\*nts"".  It's not true and I still empathise with smokers, but I was no longer going to give my money to tobacco companies and even more to the government so I could stand in an alleyway on my smoke break while paedos, rapists and non-smokers looked down on me for hiding myself away and minding my own business.

I had intended to cut down and set a start time. 31st jan 2018, but on the 27th as I was halfway through the cigarette I would have before brushing my teeth before bed and something in my head said  ""stop clinging to shit you think makes it easier as shortcuts now are long paths later"". 

Wanting to sleep but having to smoke first for what reason? Brushing my teeth many times a day because of smokes. Spraying deodorant to ""hide"" the unhideable. Having to go outside in the cold to smoke.  Automatically deducting smoke money from my paycheck before food and bills. Why was everything to my smoking schedule? Why did every single photo of myself have me with a cigarette? I put it out and as disgusting as it sounds, I actually still have that half bitch wrapped up. I immediately threw all my smokes out and in the following days I gave all my lighters and ashtrays away.

That next morning I craved a smoke. I pulled out the wrapped half smoke and took a whiff and felt sick. Then I pulled out all the crap from my cupboards and drawers and decided to just do what I had always put off. Out with the old.  I changed my ringtone. I changed my desktop wallpaper. I thew out all the old crap in the freezer, I rearranged furniture. All the things I mentioned and it was this stuff that made it easier. Seeing different things every day whilst still in my familiar environment was the kick I needed.  I would donate things I still used and needed in order to force myself to have to get new ones or at least replace them with different ones. I'd deliberately put myself in situations where I would have to walk or take the stairs instead of drive and take lifts and I started drinking water despite NEVER drinking water. Really, before my only intake was through coffee.  


Changing your environment and the little things you see, do and use every day is what will break your habit which is what quitting is all about. It's all mental after the first week. Ditch your smokes right now. If you already have, go make a huge mess in your bedroom forcing you to do a deep clean. If it's clean, then go attack that junk drawer or shed. Anything no matter how small. Rearrange things in your home, move your lamps around, put your spoons where your forks are and your forks where your knives are. Rearrange any artwork or posters or even replace them and rearrange what's on your shelves, change the radio station in your car, eat somwhere different for lunch, go online and look for a penpal or message a complete stranger, grab a random book you know nothing about and start reading even if you don't read. You can do the same things but do them differently, you can live the same life but in a fresh environment.

 Just imagine you are in a web and you need to move as randomly as possible to get out of it. It doesn't need to be all at once, but you need to change more than just stopping your smoking as in hindsight you will see how much your smoking has changed your life and habits bit by bit without you realising it so you need to do more than just stopping smoking and trying to tackle the sum of those changes in one go. Start reversing that and get off of cigarettes schedule and create your own. 

Obviously exercise is one thing that comes up and I know it's not an option for everyone, so just walk. No excuse unless you're in a wheelchair in which case, just roll. Already jog or roll? Reverse your run path. 

You'll make things much easier for yourself in the long run by making them harder in the beginning but don't forget to reward yourself (just don't do it with food, especially sugar as it goes hand in hand with nicotine.)  You'll soon forget you are trying to quit as you will be adjusting to these new habits and changes while the other little things like the new morning alarm ringtone and that horrible incense you started using even though you hate incense start going to work on you without you realising it.

Changing things about yourself also changes how other people are towards you or what you talk about which in turn changes how you are. Try new shampoo. Get a new keyring. Go to the pet store and buy the ugliest goldifish they have that nobody else will want and give it a home. Change change change and new habits.

I started keeping the bottle caps from bottles of water for some unkown reason. next thing I knew I had hundreds of them. Ended up giving them to kindergartens for arts and crafts and still do it. Feel free to develop temporary quirks or lean into existing ones.

One last thing. I used to think I smoked more when stressed and it helped to relieve it and that seems to be the general consensus among smokers. However, I've found it to be the opposite and I now see that studies have found the exact same thing. Smoking does not reduce stress in the way we think it does. Taking that break you take to have the smoke and breathing along with the temporary dopamine hit does, but that's part of why we smoked in the first place. It's all mind games but it's not until you are free of it all that you can see to what extent it all controls you. I think back to chainsmoking when stressed and only ever feeling better temporarily which is a big difference from now as now I stress like normal people but am free to actually tackle issues and not smell while doing it.

  
I know it's a long rant and I've probably repeated a lot as i just started typing without looking back, but I'll leave it as is. I only hope that even just one person will flick that switch in their head and realise that you really do have everything you need to quit right this very minute. So stop with the excuses and stop waiting for the ""right time"" as that is all your enslaved mind talking. I was the same and as I said, I am now that annoying person who says *If I can do it, anyone can* and that really is an understatement. I was such a smoke addict that there are still friends and family who don't truly believe I've quit like it's some ongoing prank. Ditch the bitches and go out and buy yourself the ugliest toothbrush you can find. It's something you see every day and will have a greater impact than buying one you like.   


Good luck, unless you are still putting it off in which case, stop undermining yourself. You probably don't like it when other people mistreat you or make you do things you don't want to do, yet here you are doing it to yourself. You probably know that too and don't care in which case just remember that you really REALLY f'n stink and your deodorant cover-up just makes you smell stupid.",40

I used to smoke consistently for about 13-14 years. The past 2 years were probably the worst I was moving from a pack a day towards a pack and a few in the past year. A long depression created a downwards smoking spiral 6 years ago, where I was having sleepless nights and I would grab my headphones and smoke 5-10 cigs in a sitting outside until I was tired enough to go to bed, and with lockdowns and wfh for a year and a half now it only got worse.

The past months I finally had enough, I was feeling it was  bad for me, every morning I knew I couldn't continue like it. I gave my cats food, grab a drink and straight back out to smoke a cigarette, sometimes I made it 3-4 hours but Everytime I caved. This week I faced I couldn't do it cold turkey, I needed help. So I bought 2 weeks worth of patches and some nrt mints for sudden cravings. I felt shame I had to admit I couldn't do it without. My mom used to smoke, she used the patches and I had the occasional streak of not smoking and she said something along the terms of you better not need patches to quit, you are 25... It haunted me for years I could do it myself how could I be so addicted, and each time I failed within a few days the past months even hours. 

But right now marks end of day 2 without touching a cigarette, it feels great. It hasn't been without challenge but I truly feel I don't need them anymore. I put the first one on and it took 5 hours for me to walk to my balcony as an involuntary movement to smoke when I realized, I don't really want one, its just a habit. The first day I made it through with one additional mint in the evening when the craving for worse I felt the craving, used the mint and it went away. Now day 2 and I made it through without a mint, not because i set myself up to not use them, just the craving wasn't there. I have had the occasional craving, at traditional smoking moments for me, before I start making dinner, after I finished dinner, when I stretch my legs after sitting down for an hour, but all in all they are slowly getting less noticeable through the day. The patches have a 10 week plan, 6 weeks 21mg patches, 2 weeks 14mg and 2 weeks 7mg. I feel I could go faster but I am not going to, I have tempted faith enough, and I am not tempting it again to save a few £'s. If this helps me quit it forever I'll happily pay for 10weeks worth of patches 90£ for 10 weeks, thats about 1 week of my old smoking habit, it's worth it, I am worth it! If only my foot would stop the nervous tapping, I am sure that will go away soon...",4

I got up to about a pack a day at my peak but mostly hung around consistent homeostasis of 10-13 cigs a day. When I turned 24, it began to feel extremely gross so I gave up regular chronic smoking and switched to having the occasional one while out drinking, yadda yadda. 

During the pandemic when all bars in my city were closed, I began drinking more at home out of boredom and smoking (in my living room and blowing the smoke out the window - gross as shit I know). I decided I was going to give up even occasional smoking for the highest quality of life possible, better lung power for the gym, no more stinking clothes or furniture, not spending $10 fucking dollars for smoking 3 cigs out of the pack and angrily throwing the entire pack away the next morning, etc etc. 

Anyway... feelin' damn good for the most part. Extremely cranky at certain points and accidentally snapped on a friend over text the other day and apologized. But other than that, I'm giving myself slack to give in to cravings for sweets, coffee, sleeping in, being distracted, etc. I have a great therapist I see weekly. Welbutrin and Adderall both decrease my cravings for tobacco pretty significantly. So yeah, even if you're just an occasional social smoker outside the bar, you should definitely still consider quitting!",79

Like most, I tried to quit smoking, but it didn't help me. In fact, out of the six years that I smoke, I've been trying to quit for two. 

My problem is that if I don't smoke for a long time, I start eating everything. I'm sure that I'm not the only one with such a problem.

 Recently, my friend gave me a good idea- to buy a Juul. My friend has been smoking Juul for quite a long time, and every time I forget my cigarettes (and this happens quite often), I take the device and make a couple of puffs. By the way, ironically, I gave him a Juul to stop smoking cigarettes. So, it happened that now he belongs to a group of people who like to smoke delicious liquid and exhale pleasantly smelling smoke. 

&#x200B;

I think smoking Juul is much more convenient than cigarettes since I can take a liquid containing Cannabis or other delicious additives. I read that the liquids for vape/Juul have cannabidiol, and cannabidiol is a drug contained in plants from the genus of hemp. It increases the heart rate, excites the body, and relaxes the nervous system. It's precisely the effect I want to experience after smoking. 

I'm already thinking about not giving up smoking completely, just changing what I smoke. This way, I will both smoke and smell nice. I found a pretty neat kit at [https://premiumvape.co.nz/brand/juul/](https://premiumvape.co.nz/brand/juul/). However, I don't know where to get the cannabis-infused products for a kit like this.

I'm interested in people's opinions about smoking Juul and vaping in general and would really appreciate tips on how I can get vaping products with Cannabis to chill and relax. Thank again for taking your time to read and for any advice you could offer. ",10

I don't know if this could help people in your journey but I hope it does give a bit of encouragement.

During the last 2 years of college was a different time for me. Had good and bad friends, experienced one of the most memorable times and worst times of my life. Got the habit of drinking and of course smoking. I struggled to fix myself right after that but I did.

Vaping actually help me with it. I went from 2 packs a day to getting the highest nic juice and started going down from there. There came a point where it didn't gave me dopamine any longer or to be more exact, it became tedious cleaning my vape, buying that once tasty vape juice till I got the vaper's tongue and seeing my hard earned money going out in a puff of ""water vapor"".

However, I realized one thing after that. I never experience relapse. Somehow vaping ease it out for me like how you would slowly quit smoking from 1 pack to a few sticks a day.

I still get that urge now and then to smoke of course. On the first year of quitting, seeing people smoke made me go a crazy with my cravings but I held on. Now, I'm happy to say that I'm free of it. It's like I was back to those days when I was young when I see people smoking and hate the damn odor and stay the hell away from it while wondering why do people smoke.

I persevered on my own and made the decision to quit myself. No one pushed me, my family never new I smoke until I told them a month after I stopped.

I just wanted to get back to the old days when I was the one being in control of myself and not anything and anyone else. Now it's been 3 years but I'll stop counting. Forget about it all and to stop saying ""I stopped smoking"" to ""I don't smoke"".

&#x200B;

TL;DR Never puff a cig/e-cig for 3 years and vaping helped.",7

Up until the end of July I was smoking heavily before starting my quit with the level 2 patch.  I did sneak one cigarette after a week, so I reset my quit date, but have not smoked since then.  Once I ran out of the patches, I switched to the 4mg mini lozenge, which I preferred, since it allowed me to experience the withdrawals and satisfy some of the ritualistic parts of smoking.  I only used about 4-6 lozenges per day as opposed to smoking an entire pack.

I allowed myself to run out of all nicotine products a little over 3 weeks ago and have been nicotine free since then.  Those final 72 hours were not that bad.  Some anxiety and restlessness, but I was in a situation that allowed me to literally avoid people the entire time, so my external triggers were very limited.  While I did have a little too much time to overthink, there was no way for me to obtain any cigarettes or nicotine products, so I had to just deal with it.

Now I do have access to smoking, but also a solid support network and commitment to staying smoke and nicotine free.  I have been able to drink alcohol and be around other smokers without relapsing.  I have had cravings, and will continue to for a time, but I feel confident in my ability to stay smoke free.

I have been reading Alan Carr’s book, though surprisingly I haven’t finished it yet.  I plan to, but haven’t needed to lean on it as much as I expected.  I’m just happy to be this far along.  It is possible, even if you relapsed after many years, like I did.

TL;DR  6 weeks smoke free, 3 weeks nicotine free.",10

When we first started dating, I didn't think much of it. I've dated smokers before. I guess there was just a small part of me that was worried about his health but meh, our relationship wasn't that serious yet so I didn't mind it. 

(I'm now a first year med student and I hear all the horror stories about smoking and the shit it does to people's lungs so I AM AFRAID.) 

We are very serious about each other now. We want to raise our own kids, we want to grow old together. I can't help but think about the fact that there's a HIIIGH chance I'll lose him early cause of how much he has smoked in the past and how much he will smoke as he continues. It doesn't help that he's 5 years older than me so it just adds up (cause older means ??? idk) 

I've wanted to bring this up for a while but I'm unsure as to how to bring it up with him. He still seems healthy so I can't use a medical condition as an excuse. 

Do smokers find it disrespectful when their SOs ask them to stop smoking? I'm just afraid he'd want to break up with me cause I haven't said anything about it for 2 years and suddenly I'm bringing it up??

It was extremely important that I did not psychologically ""start over"" or ""start from scratch"" because of the relapse because:

1. It's inaccurate.  I had been quit for two months and was used to being a non-smoker.  If I started smoking again, I would be starting over as a smoker.  Staying quit would be me continuing being a non smoker.  Additionally, I hadn't built up the physical addiction, nor patters of a smoker even if I smoked a half pack.  I did not re-pavlov-dog myself.
2. If my attitude had been that I had ""thrown it all away"", I would be more down in the dumps, and more likely to say ""might has well have another since I'm starting over anyway"".  The important thing is you don't have another, and not undo all your work you've done by becoming a smoker again.

While I think it's important you don't allow yourself to smoke, it's also important to be easy and on yourself and realistic about the situation if you do.",5

I (23M) have once again decided to break these shackles of addiction. I first started smoking when I was 18 and have been smoking close to 2 packs a day for the past years. I have been trying to quit for around 6 months now, failing everyday.  My longest quit lasted 3 days. After close to 50 failed attempts I decided to give myself a 2 week smoking pass and then put out my final one 40 minutes ago. 

I want to quit because I spend way too much time on smoking (close to 4 days a month according to my app). This affects my ability to work, even when I am working and not smoking all I can think about is my next smoke. I tend to take a break every 30-45 minutes for a smoke, so as you can imagine I can barely get anything done. As the frequency of my smoking increased I started feeling very tired, came down from working out 4-5 days a week to probably 1-2 times a month. 

All these constant failures in quitting smoking have taken a huge toll at my self esteem. From being a very confident guy I have now become someone who's scared of taking up even the simplest of challenges. I have decided I can't live like this. This needs to change, my life needs to change. I want to focused, confident and fit again. That's why I am giving myself one more chance and I hope this is the last attempt of my life.",13

2021-09-14 06:59:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/po0ial/try_again_with_nrt/,Try again with NRT,"I (42f) am taking another attempt to quit smoking. I have the problem that I am also smoking in my apartment. Remaining concentrated during home office is one big difficulty that I need to overcome. Additionally I want to finish writing my phd thesis. Some might argue that it is not the best time to quit, however, I don't enjoy smoking at all anymore. I feel with every cigarette that I am just doing this because of the craving.

I can go for hours without cig if I do something physically somewhat active. However in front of the monitor and the meetings I have the urge to smoke basically almost all the time. 

Additionally I developed unhealthy eating habits in the last year because I often smoke instead of eat and probably also subconsciously use the cigs for blood sugar control and my cigarettes have increased from ~15 up to sometimes ~23 in the last months. 

Moreover I have thyroid issues and the recovery of the thyroid function in the first three months is at least at parts responsible for what we experience as withdrawal. Cigs interfere with thyroid function in many different ways.

I also get blisters on the lips, brain fog, heavy PMS, very emotionally unstable, panic attacks, when quitting for some weeks

All this makes it a bit difficult for me to quit, while I still need to perform well enough every day. 

I tackled a lot of my health issues with supplements and diet, and I would like to go the next step to break free from this addiction. I really do not want to continue smoking because in the long run the negative effects definitely outweigh the shortterm avoidance of a difficult withdrawal and I can't stand the smell of the smoke everywhere anymore. It is disgusting. 

I came across this talk by Dr. Andrew Pipe
https://youtu.be/8nUDS9g46Uc

and he explains very well how NRT need to be individually adjusted on order to be beneficial for individual people, by first dosing high enough and then second decrease the dose in little steps. So I will give this a try. I will not quit immediately, but use the NRT to first reduce the amount of cigarettes daily, once I have found a more or less stable dose with the patches, I will replace single cigarettes with gum, whenever possible. 

I had some old patches still at home, way over their shelf life, but I thought worst case they are inefficient and I tried them since they weekend. Since they are 5mg only I observed when I would return to the frequency of approximately one every 50 minutes and noted that this is the case after approximately 4-5 hours, then I use a new 5 mg patch.

Let's say that until now I can say that the urges have drastically decreased and I feel a kind of peace and inner relaxation that I did not have for a very long time.

I am writing this OP as kind of a documentation of my own path for all of those that are interested in the approach and are in a similar difficult situation.

I am nit going to argue the quit once and for all approach. I tried for years, had weeks without cigarettes and it always affected my daily performance in a way that was actually intolerable.

Maybe I am too weak or the complexity of the other issues makes it too difficult for me. The once and for all approach did not work for me and this is exactly the argument Piper makes in his talk. If something didn't work several times, then maybe it is times to try something different.

It seems to be the right direction for me though, I cut my cigarettes in almost half at the same day I started using the patches without any difficultie. So I will wait until I receive the newly ordered 25mg patches, cut them in four pieces with ~ 6,5 mg and see if this will reduce the urge to smoke even more. The point I see with using them in the past is that they also become weaker in the course of the day, so I am trying to get a more or less constant level, that is approximately shortly below the peak level directly after smoking a cigarette. Once I have quit smoking for several days I will reduce the dose every few days by approximately 1-2mg. This should keep the withdrawal symptoms at a tolerable level.

Maybe that way it will take longer to get off the nicotine, however the fast way does not work for me and this path of tapering down has also helped me in the reduction of the thyroid hormones, where due to feedback loops, etc. The body also needs months to adjust to a new status quo. 

Best wishes to all of you. I hope I will be successfull and I hope that this will help others as well.",3

This is a little vent from which I need reassurance, tough love and common sense. Perhaps at the end some concrete tips. First though, the part you skip if you're a fan of tl;dr:


I stopped smoking on the 12 of April 2021. It was a fantastic choice. I didn't want to be a 25-year-old smoker and to an extent, I have been successful.


For nearly five months I just didn't smoke. The first 3 or 4 weeks were a bit of a ball-ache, but I could push through. I had reduced my daily smoking heavily in the build-up and was averaging 2-3 cigarettes daily before the quit; as a result the withdrawal symptoms were (I imagine) quite mild. I ate a bit more, gained some weight and then carried on.


Imagine the pride I felt! 8 years of smoking cigarettes and not wanting to and finally I had fingers firmly hooked into my bootstraps, pulling me to where I wanted to be. It was good and I had stopped thinking about it, apart from brief cravings of a few seconds. These served more as a reminder that I used to smoke than a reason to begin again.


So imagine my dismay today, realising that I am back on track to making one of the most stupid decisions of my lifetime -- AGAIN!


I MEAN WHAT SORT OF FUCKING IMBECILE MANAGES TO KICK THESE BASTARDING DEATH STICKS AND-


But anger towards myself won't help much, I believe. I am a flawed human and flawed humans don't respond well to emotional criticism.


I was with a girl. I like this girl. This girl smoked.
This girl introduced me to friends of hers. They smoked. We sat outside in the grass at a music festival. They smoked. We wore black. We appreciated how good we have it, by lamenting how bad others did. We drank alcohol.


At some stage in the night, this girl lit a cigarette and a thousand details came together in my mind.
She looked sexy, it smelled good, we were giving the world a middle finger, because we weren't allowed to care about something as trivial as our bodies, when there was so much else happening.


I'll stop now, because I am aware that I am to an extent romanticising a nicotine high and addiction.
This is why I took the cigarette, though. I took two more that night.


I was aware that I did not want to smoke and I was aware that I had no physical urge to do so. I very simply just felt like it, hence my description above.


Last Wednesday and Thursday I smoked 4 more cigarettes, I think. I was at a training course for work and we drank in the evenings. 


I've seen too many of my friends in recent years go from people who only smoked at parties and bummed fags to regular smokers. None of them wanted to. They all thought they had it under control. For many it was a long, slow descent into dependency. I reckon my history with tobacco would arrange a speedier recession into addiction.


Here I am then, back with you beautiful people. Fuck this for a lark. It's not worth the pretty girls and collective nihilism. It's definitely not worth the yellow teeth and smelly clothes, standing in the cold with a blocked nose.


I cannot yet reset my quit date. I remain proud of the 12th of April. That was the day I began having more days without cigarettes in my life than with. But I crave accountability, too.


Does anyone have an all suggestion for me in which I can work in a relapse, take the relapse seriously, but not reset all the progress I made.


I have not damaged my lungs to the same extent I did over 8 years of smoking with these 7 cigarettes and I would like a smoking app or tool that reflects that.


Thanks for listening and I hope to see you below.

Yours,

When I set him down my first thought is to sneak out back for a smoke... what the hell?! I quit last September 6th, got surprise-pregnant in November... now why are these cravings popping up now?

I've been listening to Alan Carr's *Easy Way to Stop Smoking*, finished it and threw my pack and lighters away. I didn't do it because that's what's expected or asked, but because I knew at that point, **after almost 20 years of smoking**, I was no longer a smoker. 

I set my no smoke app timer, which for me doesn't so much represent how much time my willpower has held out as much as it represents how long I've been a non-smoker from that point on -- to commemoratethe transition. That was 11 hours ago. 

I of course still feel cravings (same strength as the ones that didn't wake me up from my 8 hours of ugly-sleep every night), I still feel light withdraws, and my subconscious still sends weak-sauce suggestions, but I don't have that brainwashed dialog wreckin' my day. I'm not feeling anxious or deprived.  I'm genuinely happy, I feel good and I have no desire to smoke ever again. 

So this afternoon, I got what I would have considered the **BIG** test during my previous quits: I went shopping and my car fob slid out my shorts' pocket and under the seat. I bent over and saw one camel blue short next to a green mini-bic lighter. The occasion only missed the slight scent of sulfur and a low demonic cackle to turn it into a cliche movie temptation. 

My first thought was -- damn, I'm really **not** a smoker anymore. I don't know how many of you have had the degrading experience of tearing aparr your car during a quit or just a day when you were gonna be out of smokes for awhile, hoping to find a pack with one cig left or a half-smoked cigarette in the ashtray, but I've had that humiliating experience. Many times. When I saw that camel blue and lighter, I realized I hadn't combed through my car this time. Hadn't even considered it. I then threw the cig and flick away without a problem. It wasn't even a temptation.

I have to emphasize: this has never been my experience before and I've tried to quit a *brazillion times*. I also want to recognize the percentage of smokes who read the book and don't find it easy the first time (keep up the tries, I believe in you). I also want to say, I know I'm just one cigarette away from falling back into the trap, being a smoker again and needing to stop.  Again. Relapse is the norm and should be a part of rehabilitation. 

But right now, I feel... like celebrating! I'm really happy! 

I'm wishing everyone who is stopping, myself included, this happiness from now on! I'm rooting for ya'll!",32

It’s only been a month since I’ve been back and already I’m smoking 15/20 a day again on average. 

Resetting my smoke free days on the app will be absolutely demoralising, but I have no one to blame other than myself. The motto “not another puff, no matter what” is SO true. Learn from my mistake, after a certain point you will get so complacent that you think you could smoke 5/10 in a day for a weekend and not get addicted. But before long you’ll start rationalising smoking to yourself again, and because it’s been so long since you last smoked, you’ll have forgotten most of the negatives of it. 

Starting from now I will be quitting again. I’m hoping this time around it will not be as difficult, especially as most of the negative habits haven’t formed yet. But man does it feel shit to be back on day zero again.",71

2021-09-12 16:18:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pn09ko/my_quit_smoking_story/,my quit smoking story,"So 6 months back I stopped smoking. I had quit and started smoking again in past. since over a year I was trying to quit. one day I just said F it, whatever cravings I get bring it on. I don't want to screw up my health anymore.

so from March 1st week I stopped smoking, I would usually spend around 250 to 300 CAD per month. smoking a 25 sticks pack in 2 days. and 1 pack costs 15$ for pall mall blue.

to motivate myself I purchased a glass jar, I would put 100$ in it per week as a symbol of how much I didn't spend on smoking.

the first week was the most difficult. I didn't get so much of physical cravings like stomach pain or headache. my symptoms were more like restlessness, couldn't sleep, uneasiness, I would get angry quite easily. but that was only for 1 week. and I was smoking for around 7 to 8 years.

after the 1st week, things started to get good. my brain fog started to clear up. I never knew I had such a thing. I felt lightheaded, I could think clearly without getting angry. I just felt a big weight has been lifted away from me. so I started taking evening walks. before I never felt like walking or going out since my work is from home now.

and from that initial 1 week of torture, after that everything is good. at times I would crave it while I'm watching movie and I see someone smoke, or while I was stressed. but I did not give up.

I was more curious to see how my body / mind felt when I'm off nicotine. because since 20 years old I am smoking everyday for 8 years now. cigarette had become such an everyday thing that I couldn't imagine life outside of it.

now 6 months later, I see the glass jar in front of me in which I used to put my cigarette money when I didn't smoke. now it has totalled to around 1500$! I could not imagine I was spending so much on nicotine. now I am planning to buy myself a gaming pc this Christmas.

if you're a person who's struggling with quitting smoking. imagine if you could buy a gaming pc or any other thing for free! just by saving your smoke money!",48

2021-09-12 12:17:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pmvom4/three_week_update/,Three Week Update,"Hello everyone,  


This is my three week update.  Here are my [introductory](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/p9mbpk/advice_and_encouragement_needed/), [one week](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pdwrih/one_week_update/), and [two week](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pif0tx/two_week_update/) posts if you are interested in my journey, if not, this post should serve well as a stand-alone too. 

Unlike last week, I had zero things that could remotely resemble cravings. I'm free, it's over. For those of you thinking about quitting, or early on in, I think it needs to be emphasized how excellent it is to not be a smoker. I speak with a lot of people and share various experiences about a lot of topics, so although I haven't personally experienced every one of these things, I feel confident with the ones I have and the way the others have been described to me to say that all of these are in the ballpark of what it is like to be done with cigarettes. If you have done any of these things, feel free to add.  


Getting glasses, or even getting lasik. Either way, you can literally see the world in a way you never have before. No more being a slave to bad eyesight or pair of glasses/contacts. Every aspect of your daily life is instantly improved by the eye-sight you should have always had. Imagine living your life thinking your vision was fine only to discover that it is so much better. You'd be ecstatic.

Building an emergency fund. Or becoming debt free. Personally, I have never found an unexpected problem that $8000-$10000 doesn't fix. Of course, I don't have a family so my number could probably be lower than that, but I like the security. Point being, this is another thing that completely changes your life for the better. Car breaks? Unexpected bill? Covid Layoff, etc. It's amazing what this one feels like. There's no more money stress. I got this one out of the way early, but there was a time in my college days where I was so stressed about money than I would literally have dreams at night about still not having $2 to buy a coffee. Once I decided enough was enough, and put everything into saving cash for these problems, the problems stopped happening. 

Getting fit. Even just mildly. This is a good one too. I've never been fat personally, but I have been so out of shape that it was almost as bad. Getting off the couch, getting out of bed, just anything that involved any sort of voluntary movement seemed like such an inconvenience. After just a few sessions at the gym, and it doesn't matter what kind of workout you do, as long as it's *something* it will work*.* You'll get your life back and instead of making a face expressing that you want the asker to ensure that it is something important when asking you to get off your ass to do something simple, you'll leap at it because not only is it easy, but it is also fun to help someone. They wouldn't ask if they didn't need your help.

Getting out of jail (like I said, I talk to a lot of people with very unique experiences). Or escaping Poland in the Soviet ages. 

All of these things result in the same feeling, the freedom. The getting your life back. The Air smells good, the lighting is more vibrant, you want to jump for joy and you actually can! You're not trapped, and you realize that you never had to be. I'm sure there are countless others, and it's probably easier to just ask what the best moment or lifestyle adjustment you've ever made was, and tell you that smoking can't be topped, only matched. It's wonderful.

&#x200B;

It's only been three weeks since I've had a smoke, or any form of nicotine, but it actually feels like a distant memory now. Not that I was a smoker, but the act of lighting one up and inhaling the smoke. Right now, that act seems so out of the question that it's hard to imagine actually doing. I guess that that is to be expected when I have not smoked the 509(!!!) cigarettes that I would have smoked over that amount of time. And yes, that is truly insane. 509 smokes. Never again.

One thing that I think Allen Carr understated, although still emphasized in his book was the relation to will power. He pointed out that it takes willpower to start smoking in the first place, and it was very easy to nod along to that. Not a single aspect of smoking is actually enjoyable until you're addicted to the nicotine, and yet we worked hard to get to that point. Why? I'm not sure, but anecdotally, I thought about every smoker I knew... It was just most of them, it was ALL of them who could be accurately described as *strong-willed* I can only speak for myself there, but I have a hunch that most people would draw a similar conclusion when thinking of the smokers they know. Maybe there's one or two out there somewhere who aren't headstrong, maybe.  


My Ferrari fund is now at over $330 after the three weeks. Mathematically, there's still no reason I won't be able to buy a supercar at some point in my life with this fund built with money saved from smoking. I'm going to love this, but already I find it hard to imagine that I will enjoy it more than being free from smoking. 

It's also amazing how little I go into gas stations. I think I may have actually been inside one once since my last smoke. Usually just pay at the pump, don't deal with those damn lottery ticket people, lines, etc. The smoke free app doesn't calculate the time saved from that into their models, but calling that 5-10 minutes per day doesn't seem unreasonable.  


Finally, today is the start of football. This is going to be interesting because NFL games have LOTS of time for smoking. I used to constantly smoke while watching football. Especially up here in Canada. See, we get Canadian commercials, and they're repetitive and terrible. We're get the good doctor, a virgin moblie, expedia, a truck commercial, and an NFL shop one during every single commercial break. Quite often, these commercials will play more that once in each break. The jingles in your head are so irritating after an hour that you have to mute the TV. This is also why I don't miss watching anything on The Paramount Network where their ads are all just clips of their own shows. Sometimes even while you're watching that exact show. 

That was an interesting post for my three week update, I came in without having a lot to say and rambled, hopefully it was at least entertaining. The truth is, it's hard to keep writing specifically about not smoking as it's become such a non-issue after three weeks. Once you kill your addiction (I called mine ""The Dirty Bastard"") by starving it to death via not letting it have what it wants, there isn't anything that would make you want to be a smoker. There just isn't. I'll never be a smoker again, and nothing about that seems uncomfortable... or even anything short of the best feeling there is. 

Thanks again for sticking along for the journey. If you have anything to add, please do so. I'll keep these posts up if I can, but some will turn into rambles like this. Any time I spend rambling is still better than any time spent smoking.",15

Endless gratitude for the advice, support, and stories on this journey of self-improvement. This is my personal experience in case it can help someone along the way get through even one craving,  from a 10 year smoker and 5 year vaper

**Wanting to Quit:**   
-felt so shameful/embarrassed about this habit. I was always ended up lying to friends, families, and coworkers to sneak out to get a fix.   
-awful migraines on the daily   
-it’s expensive!! Living in NYC on a modest salary, I cut corners on almost everything but justify spending $20 every two days on nicotine. This is $300 a month. $3600 a year. I would bust my ass off at work for a $3.6k raise   
-felt my mood was dependent on a drug

**Quitting:**   
-I have many attempts of quitting smoking before, but don’t like to see them as “failed” attempts.That 25 day streak is still 25 days I didn’t smoke. Progress isn’t always linear. Some people can quit first time cold turkey and that’s incredible! But I am not one of those people. I try to look at it as if it’s a workout. I wouldn’t expect to get my goal mile time the first try, but that doesn’t mean that I am doomed and should give up. Please keep trying    
-the reason I always end up smoking again is because I can’t stand being irritable. I’m trying to identify my triggers and find replacement behaviors. Recognizing my weak moments makes me actively try harder in those times   
-I end my quits by taking “ just one puff” which ALWAYS leads to the habit again. I either bum off a friend  or tell myself it’s ok to “treat myself” just this one time. You are lying to yourself. If you never make that micro-decision for one more puff, you won’t fall back into the trap.    

**Resources:**   
-Allen Carr’s Easy Way. This is not a magic book I read and immediately found it easy to quit, nor do I use all his techniques, but am at least armed with the knowledge. Just get the book. You can sometimes find it at the library even. It is probably 5 hours of your life that you would’ve been on Reddit anyway. Main takeaway is that nicotine does nothing for you except bring a tiny bit of relief that nicotine caused in the first place (paradoxically the feeling a non-smoker has all the time)   
-patches and nicotine lozenges. I’ve done the patch before and didn’t have intense cravings (and mostly even forgot about smoking after a week or so). This is the first time I’m doing two types - 14mg patch for a week, now at 7mg, and maybe two 2mg lozenges throughout the day. I haven’t had any really bad cravings! Even stepping down was fine, I was kind of moody for the day but nothing dramatic. Can update when I am completely free from NRT (sorry Allen Carr).   
-workout. Do a YouTube workout, take a run, do some squats. Whatever works for you to exert your body somehow and get that sweet endorphin release   
-SmokeFree app. Satisfying timers to keep track of your quit time, little daily missions, and things to scroll through while you have a craving helps a ton!   
-journal. Write down your reasons, struggles, and benefits. This is really cathartic for me. 
   
All these things ($15 book, $50 NRT, $1/week SmokeFree app STILL cheaper than smoking)   

**I believe in you:**   
-don’t give up!   
-you will be so proud of yourself!   
-I am proud of you!   
-si se puede!",20

Everything seemed ugly. I wanted to smoke so much, just one puff. I understood that I can't stand being in this room with those people anymore. I got out.   
On a way home I wanted to smoke so much, but I was repeating to myself something like: it's easy to start smoking and it will be not easy to quit again.   
I called my friend and felt better somehow. Weekends are tough for me",12

Day 1 (24h mark) as a nonsmoker, quitsure, and probably some overshare. :)","Older dude checking in. I started smoking when I was about 16 because I thought it was cool. Fast forward 30+ years and I have smoked well over 100,000 cigarettes. Well, that was stupid.

I successfully quit once when I had my first kid, I started again when I lost my second. Fast forward a few years and my kid isn't far from leaving home for university, I'm tired, my body aches even though I get lots of exercise, I worry about cardio vascular issues when I wake up with tingling hands, I'm single and smoking hinders my options and I'm not going to lie or try and hide the fact I stink, smoking is expensive and times are tough these days.

I'm getting and feeling old.

But I'm not giving in. I've spent the last few months losing weight, getting stronger, learning about all sorts of new stuff, getting better at my job, becoming more empathic and passionate. Nicotine is my last anchor and has been the majority cause for the remainder of my problems. It's made me sick and has been keeping my sick for decades.

By chance I stumbled upon the quitsure app (no affiliation and it's free) and for the first time I've been able to understand nicotine and be honest with myself about my smoking. Diving into the psychological side of nicotine addiction has made the step of quitting so much simpler. I've tried and failed with NRT, vaping, cold turkey, and reduction, all of which in hindsight seem like silly things to do now that I understand how nicotine works in my body and brain. I am now well equipped to spend the rest of my life as a non-smoker, in fact the though of a smoke disgusts me. I am free.

Here's to a better life for all of us.

**tldr;** understanding nicotine, the way it interacts with our body and brain, and the psychology of addiction has had a huge impact on my perception of smoking and the thought of having a smoke disgusts me.",82

I have been trying to quit smoking for the last 6 months but I relapse at the third day on almost every attempt due to stomach problems as along with extreme physical discomfort.

What side effect I had been going through:

Bloating.
Vomiting.
Extreme stomach pain.
Dizziness.
Heart palpations.

I imagine this is happening because my body has became extremely dependent to nicotine. I don't know what to do.

I don't want to nicotine patches gums or any other physically coping solutions.

I really am reluctant to see a doctor about this. I just feel like I should be able to quit without having this much of a physical side effect apart from having cravings which I can deal with.

I would appreciate some advice from OG ex/non smokers in this subreddit.

Note: I eat a lot of fiber to regulate my stomach problems but they don't seem to help a lot.

Thanks for taking time to read my post and considering providing an answer.

Great community.

Cheers.",6

If after 1 year and a mindset in the right place is all it takes for you to stay smoke free for life. Then just imagine you have 1 year to finish the course or degree and after that you are free.

But once those split second cravings, I remind myself that I don't smoke and that the smell is so gross. Nor will it make me feel better. I also quit for a reason. 

Despite that the social aspect might have been what I enjoyed most about when I smoked, by the end of the day, it's an addiction. And you ALWAYS here lifelong smokers talking about how they wish they could quit and tell me congrats or good for you. This might sound a redundant but I've never met someone that still smokes who goes, ""you quit smoking, that's lame"" nor do they interrogate me about why I quit. Addictions of any kind suck and you gotta realize you successfully did something many smokers and addicts failed to do. If I had a dollar for every time my friends said they wanna quit or need to quit, I'd be super rich. And I'm not judging them. That just goes to show how addictive smoking is and how hard it is to break. Going back to that and having ""just one"" would restart the process.",24

This discomfort has been called withdraws, but I don't like that because it's focus is on ""not-smoking"" and relief from cigarettes.

Instead, I offer this: When we drink, we can reasonably expect to wake up to a hangover. A hangover isn't withdraws from drinking, rather it's the consequence of drinking. We might even swear off drinking ever again because of the pressure and pounding in our heads, the body aches, etc. While a ""hair of the dog that bit you"" might level you out a little, you know that the only way to avoid hangovers is to not drink again. 

I think the same about discomfort after quitting: this is a cigarette hangover. Every craving between cigarettes is a hangover. A puff might level me out. But the only way to never have this hangover again is to not smoke. 

I hope this might help someone when they're arguing with their own reasoning during a quit",7

2021-09-11 02:59:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pm2l71/joy_without_smoking/,Joy without smoking,"Hey everyone. I'm at day 5 quitting smoking. I broke the rest of my pack 5 days ago, but then smoked partial cigarettes without the filter and probably had less than 2 full ones for 2 days. Today is the second full day without smoking aside from a bit of a butt I smoked yesterday. 

It's hard. After the 3rd night, because it was so hard, I felt a bit of relief for a moment in the morning, and it was like I remembered that it is possible to feel joy without smoking, but then it went away and its back to being difficult.

With smoking its like you feel as though you can only feel joy from smoking and everything else is better when smoking, but the sobering reality is that everything else is just passing the time and the only feeling of joy is from smoking when addicted. 

I know I have experienced joy in the past without smoking, but when going through cravings its like you forget or just can't even imagine feeling it anymore without. However because of that morning on the third day when gandalf appeared with the sunrise at the east...(jk, nerdy joke), I know I can feel joy without smoking and that the reality is every little thing will start to bring joy, but its still hard to imagine when going through serious cravings.

I guess writing this just helps, because I know even something like smelling fresh air in a forest would be 10000x more enjoyable when not addicted or even something dumb like macaroni on the stove, and other things like sex(even without a partner), which just feels like releasing an urge when addicted to smoking, and playing games and getting a good item which when smoking is just like ""well now I'll reward myself with a cigarette"", because the reality is any sense of joy(arguably a false sense) and reward relies on smoking when addicted.

Anyways, I was writing the post for help at first because I needed help because I lost that 3rd morning feeling and was struggling to imagine joy without smoking, leading me to consider smoking again, but logically I know on some level it will get better and the only thing I can do is keep going with no real concept of when I'll actually feel joy again.

Also coffee is arguably not helpful, its more of a high than a down like smoking and when really high you just want something to bring you down even more, but the habit of drinking it seems to help a bit. I've been trying to have tea more than coffee because just the habit of a hot bitter drink is nice(I feel like without sugar its actually more enjoyable because the sugar just feels like a poor smoking substitute).

Also having essential oils in a diffuser seems to help a bit, along with the smell it also makes the air more humid causing you to sweat out more nicotine. I've also been running every day/other day. I feel like the more I do to get through smoking the harder it is, but I also know its partially because everything I've been doing is making me get rid of the nicotine faster causing stronger cravings.

Now I'm just ranting though. If you're struggling just know you can experience joy without smoking even though its almost impossible to imagine when going through strong cravings. If you've had a brief moment of joy without then just hold on to that feeling. The reality is I haven't truly experienced joy in over 10 years from smoking/drugs and I know it could be years until I really experience it again, but it has to be better than this.

I'm honestly not usually this depressed, which makes you think ""well I laugh and what not when smoking"", but the reality is aside from those brief moments with family/friends, you're not fully experiencing joy because those hours and hours between those moments you could be enjoying yourself rather than passing the time and numbing your body just to feel rewarded from dumb things you do when you can just feel rewarded by the actually thing in itself instead of relying on a cigarette. 

Thanks for listening.",13

* My throat doesn't hurt anymore. One of the best benefits. My throat was always irritated and dry and in pain. I was addicted to cigarettes but my throat was miserable.
* I cough 80-90% less. Didn't cough a lot before, but it's still better.
* Just generally breathe so much better. And the smells become stronger. 
* I am generally out of shape so I do run out of breath easily, but this improved so much after I stopped smoking. Now I feel like I'm actually a little out of breath and not dying. 
* Might be unrelated and TMI but I have better bowel movements.
* Just feel better, not being tied to smoking. I am really happy I quit smoking. 

Tips:

* You need a strong motive and you need discipline. I thought I had a strong motive so I was baffled that I wasn't quitting already. Then kind of had a fit over the fact that I keep smoking and just quit. I was very frustrated that I couldn't quit. It helped.
* You don't have to set a date if it's not your thing. You can if you feel like it helps and I encourage you to, but you can also just say ""fuck it"" at 2 am on a Tuesday and it's going to work. 
* Keep your hands and mouth busy whenever you feel like you want a cigarette. I wouldn't recommend chips or such. Maybe gum or mints or candy that you can suck on. And allow yourself to eat what you want to a certain degree. Remember: it's very hard to diet and quit smoking so most specialists advise against it. You can return to the diet once the cravings stop and smoking is less of a problem. 
* Not gonna lie to you, the first three days are tough. You can't focus, you want to smoke, etc. The good thing is that you are stronger than your desire to smoke. It's one day. You can power through one day. And if you can power through that day, you can power through all the rest of them. 
* Only if you feel prepared: As soon as you're out of the crazy cravings period, you can try to expose yourself to triggers (drink coffee, drink alcohol, hang around with friends who smoke). In this way, over time, they will not present as triggers, or, at least, they won't be such big triggers. It's also fine if you avoid these triggers. Whatever keeps you smoke-free. 
* If you fail, try again. Keep this as a goal. Most ex-smokers failed at least once. Quitting is hard, but it is doable. It doesn't matter if you manage to do it the first time or the seventh time or whatever. As long as you manage to quit, it's worth it. 
* Do not tell people you quit unless you have to. Some people can be assholes when you're trying to quit and the things they say will not always be helpful. You just mind your journey and ignore those who talk big but don't appreciate or respect hard work. 
* If you need professional help, seek it. Smoking is as much of an addiction as any other addiction. It's okay to need help.",54

I'm 39 and I smoked for probably 20 years or so. I've tried to quit innumerable times. I've had a few successes but I always end up back smoking again. This attempt I'm at 18 days and I'm just feeling sick of it. It's mentally draining to keep fighting. On top of that everything I like doing somehow involves smoking. I'm exercising and running and physically I feel awesome but mentally I'm feeling depressed and I'm just avoiding basically everything that's not reading a book, exercising, or sitting in my house avoiding all the stuff I normally smoked through. For instance, right now friends are texting me asking if I want to hang out and have a drink, which I can't do because if I drink I will want to smoke. Nicotine has wound its shriveled little fingers into everything I do. If I smoke I'm just going to start this whole process over again. Thanks for listening, this was very cathartic!",51

I have been smoking for about 5.5 years of my life. I’ve quit twice and relapsed just before 3 months both times. I’ve used cold turkey, Chantix, and nic gum and have not had much success. I wanted to ask if anyone has had luck with nicotine patches? I really want to quit but am having a hard time stopping. In the last few months I’ve become an uncontrollable chain smoker and I hate it. I’ll admit I’m becoming desperate. Even though I spend nearly 25% of my annual income on tobacco, that fact alone doesn’t combat with the urges and cravings. I feel so weak, like a failure. The patches feel like my only option at this point, and I was also hoping for some advice on how helpful or not helpful they may be. Any advice on the matter of initial quitting would be appreciated as well.

Sometimes when I smoked, I would feel that with the nicotine ""high"" would also come a sapping or draining of my energy. I was aware of it, but figured that the ""benefit"" I perceived from smoking outweighed that energy drain.

I was wrong. Not only was it a physical energy drain, it was a mental one too. My mind feels faster and I feel more free overall to do what I want because I don't have that nicotine stealing my energy.

I anticipated feeling better, but I wasn't anticipating this much of a difference. It's significant.

STOKED.

Backstory:  
Started smoking at 18. I'm 41 now. Active lifestyle—surfer for 30 years, rock climbing, spearfishing. Quit smoking because it was holding me back from higher physical performance. Tired of feeling weak when surf is good or scared that I'm going to drown when waves get big. Just finished 2 years sober. Feeling good and feeling even better now that the ciggies are on their way out the window.",12

It's 3:30 a.m., and this rude insane addiction just woke me up, screaming through my dreams into my subconscious, that it *needed* to be attended to. It wouldn't be ignored. The more I tried to suggest it away and go back to sleep, the larger it grew until it was a nightmarishly huge beast: a looming three-headed monster of insistent deep cravings, wide-spread withdraw symptoms and unrelenting mental suggestions. Anxiety gripped my body and took control of my voice,  ""This is terrible! I can't do this!"" I wailed to my partner. 

I don't have much a plan. I have some reasons to quit. I have people in my life who want me to quit. But right now, all of my will to quit is being snuffed out by the betrayer part of my mind, which is well-practiced in compiling with the beast's insidious suggestions, telling me why I could (why I SHOULD) have  just have one more cigarette (it'll take the edge off); buy just one emergency pack of cigarettes to get through the worst of the withdraw; I never really wanted to quit, I just needed to cut back; NoThInG iS wOrKiNg! 

I grabbed a cuttie, some ice water and this phone. I read my reasons to quit, my hourly success goals (despair: not even a full day yet -- how many times have I been here). I read some of you on this sub-reddit. 

I remembered: One cigarette doesn't make this feeling go away. One cigarette, my last cigarette, is the reason I feel this way. This is how it feels to be a smoker between their last puff and the next, and the only way not to feel like this is to not smoke one cigarette more. You can't feel satisfied as a smoker -- you can not crave as a non-smoker.

Withdraw is unpleasant -- I don't want to restart, prolong this

I do not want to be anxious, smelly, unhealthy, unable to take any job I want or go any where I please because I have to consider this beastly addiction first (before myself, my family, our well-being). I *WANT* to quit! 

This is working. Relief comes the longer I don't feed the last cigarette with another cigarette. By just not taking a drag, I'm slaying a dragon.

Almost 14 hours behind me. I'm going back to bed, I hope. I wish ya'll health and success.",14

After sleepover at my friends' flat I woke up competely alone. My friends went to work and forgot to leave me the keys. So I couldn't leave the apartment. I had very few cigarettes, only six or seven. And worst of all, I didn't have a lighter.   
Every smoker knows that at morning urge to smoke is just huge. You can kill for this first morning cig. So my situation sucked by a lot. I was in a panic. I didn't know what to do if I couldn't smoke my morning cigarette. Morning cigarette. Morning cigarette. Morning cigarette. Only smokers will understand how important it is. Morning cigarette. Fuck.  
I was saved by very old(and also very lame) electric stove. It was looking just like black metal circle. And, lucky for me, this metal circle was heating up. But it was heating up so damn slowly. It took at least fifteen minutes before I could smoke from this stove.   
In conclusion, I must say that it was a nightmare day. I had only 6 or 7 cigs so I had to smoke very rarely. It was a nightmare day because, well, life of addicted person is generally not very bright thing.

My personal experience.,"I joined this reddit group because I recently quit smoking cigarettes.  I would like to first point out that I am not encouraging nicotine use at all in this post.  I am only sharing my story as it's what has worked for me to quit smoking cigarettes.  To each his/her own and whatever works for one person maybe isn't the best option for another person.

So I quit smoking cigarettes on Sunday August 29th, 2021.  My last cigarette was on Saturday night, the night before.  I went 10 days without a cigarette and then decided to smoke just one cigarette.  The cigarette tasted so nasty and made my throat hurt.  

So I'm now back to no smoking cigarettes again.  I switched to oral smokeless tobacco (dip) and this is what has worked best for ME. 

I also have been using nicotine lozenges from time to time, but they just aren't as satisfying as the dip for ME. 

I am not encouraging anyone to use nicotine in any form, I am simply sharing that switching to using dip works well for me because I have less and less cravings for cigarettes as each day goes by.

In my opinion smokeless tobacco is a safer alternative than cigarettes.  I have read many reliable studies and research to back my opinion up.

Good luck to everyone trying to quit and I hope everyone can find a way that works for them.",2

Hoping to vent a bit here and see how other people deal with everyday stress after quitting.

I moved with my partner from the UK to Spain in April, and we moved to a new city last month. It's been ridiculously hot all of August and we both have been unwell with different things, so had a shit month. We haven't had a very good opportunity to get to know our city as it's been too hot to go outside, everyone leaves here in August. So we've both had an underlying level of stress, questioning a lot of things, and not enjoying our time here all that much. Recently I started having heart palpitations, which I attributed to vaping alongside smoking (I know..), but I'm still having palpitations 6 days after stopping.. so I'm assuming by now it's mostly stress/anxiety. I've had my heart checked and it seems ok.

Because of everything going on, my stress levels are very high, I feel very anxious and can't sleep well, and I am considering resuming smoking cigarettes because I don't know if I can deal with this added layer of stress from the withdrawal right now. My partner is also very stressed and it's all getting a bit too much for me... At the same time, this is the longest I've gone without smoking in over 10 years, and my first attempt at quitting, so I'm sad to let it go to waste and have to go through the same again.

How can I deal with day to day stresses of life after quitting?

Is there actually such thing as a bad time to stop smoking, because it really feels like it?

If I were to smoke 1 cigarette, is it going to set me back to day 1 in terms of withdrawals and emotions?",2

Due to a very traumatic personal experience I have relapsed and smoked a pack in about a week, coming to a climax when I smoked 5 cigarettes today after being smoke free for 2 months. Enough is enough, my lungs have just made the most horrendous wheeze (I should add that I’m asthmatic) and my health anxiety is on an all time high, this IS my lesson and my last straw.
I have smoked on and off for about 3-4 years (I’m 21), with 1 1/2 of them being “sober” (is that even a word that applies to smoking cigarettes?). So I know I can do this, I have done it once. I could use any sort of encouragement and kind words, like I said my health anxiety is crazy high and I’m basically convinced that I’ll drop dead from lung cancer any second (this is only a slight exaggeration, haha…), so any reassurance is happily welcomed.

Another thing I’ve noticed that instead of having more energy, the last few days I’ve been completely exhausted, which is disappearing because I was looking forward to working out but want to listen to my body and not push myself too much because I know I have a lot of healing to do.

so i started vaping december of 2017 (i was 15) to fit in with my new friend group. they didn't force me in any way, i just really wanted to be accepted by them.

i didn't even like it at first. it made me uncontrollably sweaty and anxious. however, at some point, it escalated to the point where it became an addiction -- and i knew it.

i used juul (of course HAHAH) and these days, it's about 1 pod a day. it's even gotten to the point where if i'm extra stressed, i can go through 2 pods a day.

for reference, 1 pod is equivalent to a pack of cigarettes in the level of nicotine and it takes, on average, 200 puffs to finish a pod.

i want to be healthy. i want my lungs to feel better.

i am lucky enough to be only 19 and not be legally allowed to buy vape stuff, it does help with not buying it when i have a strong urge.

i have gum and it helps so much, but for some reason i get into this cycle of thinking 'i just wanna get withdrawal over with' so i stop chewing the gum and then i get so desperate i start vaping again. it's a vicious cycle.

my dad buys me the vape stuff. horrible, i know, but he has been a food addict for his entire life, and he's almost 50. he can't seem to do it and my mom says that he most likely doesn't think others can get through addiction, since he hasn't been able to.

i know i'm strong enough. i have summoned up so much willpower in many situations in my life so i know i can get through it. i just don't prepare enough.

also, just to be clear, the only person in my life who believes i can do it is my mom. she has been a huge help, but my point of bringing this up is to say that i have no other support for this -- as i said above, my dad is no help and my only friend right now smokes daily. she also doesn't seem to believe i can do it, but she's seen me fail many-a times so it's fair i guess.

i just need help adding more coping mechanisms in my life to help me quit and advice for taking preventative measures for when i do get strong cravings.

Today is the day I'm gonna give up this nefarious habit. I had already tired to stop in the past, but I wasn't really serious about it. This time is different, for many reasons, I joined a local support group run by NHS professionals and attended their first gathering yesterday. Actually, the reason I'm writing this is because they adviced us to keep a diary and share it with other people who are going through the same. I guess it might be useful to find some support outside the group as well, so here we go.


I started smoking when I was 22, mainly because I was depressed and lonely. But the very real reason, I think, was just to piss off my obnoxious, manipulative father who had always used guilt and shame to control me.
I knew I wasn't acting smart, but somehow I felt like I had and **I wanted** to do it. That first ever pack I bought was like a reminder that nothing but me is in charge of my own actions and can decide how to live my own life.  Yeah, it's pretty dumb but somehow it made sense to me. 

But it's not something I want to do for the rest of my life. Except... I really like smoking! I like how it makes me feel, the bitter taste of tobacco and the smell it leaves on my fingers when I smoke. It's just not worth it, I know, but still I'm not really incline to conscious decisions when I want something.

Today I trashed the last pack I had, my lighter and ashtray as well. I don't want to risk to fall again for them just because of my impulsive temper.



What did you do to ease the process and motivate you? I see that many people here use apps to track for how long they didn't smoke but I don't think they'll work for me...

(NRT),"Just finishing up day two without cigarettes and it's going really well this time as I'm using patches (no cravings yet, just brain constantly ""suggesting"" cigarettes, as they are completely ingrained in my life...)

I have been wondering, as the course of patches is meant to last for 12 weeks, and you're getting a constant stream of nicotine the whole time, what should I be expecting after that point?

It would seem most recommendations are that you get down to the lowest patch, and stick with that for two weeks. What then? Just full on stop? For any of you who have tried NRT, what approach did you take after the X week mark?",2
2021-09-07 20:21:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pjzkca/my_quitting_journey_so_far_since_march_2020_long/,"My quitting journey so far, since March 2020 (long)","This is not a strict plan at all. I used to have really bad panick attacks, which withdrawals would trigger, and part of me quitting included getting into a better situation (in my case, housed and weeding out toxic people, working on my boundaries, etc) and learning grounding excersizes, self care, cutting down on caffeine, getting support emotionally from friends and other places, and things to manage my anxiety. I believe the fact that I have a lot of trauma and anxiety is what made my old quit attempts so much harder and I've basically learned that it's really important to be kind to myself.

Before March 2020 I'd attempted to quit many times cold turkey.

In March of 2020, when I became housed, someone I live with has breathing problems, so I took care to walk away from the house to smoke, and I tried vape but it was too complex, and then I found vuse ecigs. That worked and it wasn't super cloudy so it wouldn't bother anyone since I was on the opposite end of the house in a room added on later that didn't have vents leading into the house.

So March 2020, I quit cigs and switched to vuse ecig pods. It was a pretty easy switch, if I'm being honest, and now cigarettes make me sick. The physical benefits were pretty noticable, my breathing cleared up, my stomach issues cleared up. I liked not having a cigarette smell or having to go out of my way to go outside. I liked being able to puff every few minutes instead of smoke a whole cig every 2 hours. Vaping the ecig in bed is nice. It also shattered the ritualistic aspect, which was huge for me.

I have attempted to quit cold turkey several times since then and it doesn't work.

So I have introduced nicorette/nic gum partly because it's possible to get it delivered since it's not marketed as a tobacco/nicotine product but as a quitting aid, although if the kids\~ start abusing it it'll probably be unavailable too. (Please don't, people like me really need this stuff. :c)

Fast forward, I'm now using nic gum intermittently with ecig pods. The gums works at keeping the hard withdrawals at bay, but it doesn't help when I really, really need to concentrate hard and softening that edge isn't enough. It doesn't deliver as fast as my body wants. The major thing now holding me back is that the type of work I do is mentally exhausting and I spend waaaay too many hours a day on it.

So now I'm trying to pick up some less mentally taxing work on the side. Basically I think if I just worked maybe 6 hours on the hard stuff and did easier stuff on the side, I could get away with only gum. Right now I'm doing more like 10ish (I take breaks so idk exactly, and some days I know it's more than that) hours of mentally draining work pretty much 6 days a week.

I am at a point where I'm just tired of nicotine and I don't like the headache I get from the pods, and I'm just sick of spending so much money and being dependent on this.

Overall, it's been a combination of changing my life, basically doing a lot of self therapy, and paving a path where it's possible for me to quit rather than trying to force myself to quit and deal with life as-is.

I think it's interesting that in trying to quit nic I've had to really take all this other stuff into account and that as I work on my life and myself emotionally, I'm also working on quitting long term.

It's also nice to be able to call myself a former smoker and to say that I quit cigarettes, after so many failed attempts. I also feel a lot better having made some progress. I'm not totally free, but I've also shown myself that I'm not totally at the mercy of cigs or nic either. It's basically like, hey I lost some battles, won some battles, and ultimately I know I'm going to win the war if I just keep trying and making little bits of progress.",7

I quit 8 years ago August 25. Not only am I benefiting from health benefits and not spending money on cigarettes I improved one of my favorite  hobbies.  When I quit I put an app on my phone that tracked health benefits and money not being spent on cigarettes.  After a few months when it got up to $250 I celebrated by buying myself my first tablet to use for  the internet and try Kindle. I have been into reading since I was 12. The Kindle has been the best purchase I have ever made!  It opened a  whole world of books that are not in book stores or  at the used bookstores I used to  frequent.  Some of the books cost a little more than the bookstore books but I figured out that I was still spending less than I had by buying a pack a day.  Over the years I have reread many of my books too.  I read daily now because there is a endless number of books available. 

Been awhile  since I have been on here.  I just shared this on on my book groups  and it made me want to share here. Maybe reading isn't your thing but I do believe quitting  is a  accomplishment that deserves an award. That is what I chose and an amount I felt comfortable with. 

I also used to take Ativan 3 or 4 times a week for anxiety.   After quitting I used less and less then eventually only use for emergency a few times a year.   Should really have put this first!

So happy for all of you here that have quit and for all of you lurking trying to get the motivation to quit good luck!  The Allen Carr book  Easy  Way to Stop Smoking  helped me quit cold turkey.",5

Like I'd always smoke around friends, coworkers, etc. But when I was around family members or dates that would find it to be a dealbreaker, I was a ""non-smoker"". 

Any time I was near family, I either waited to smoke and sometimes I would stress about being eager to leave them so I could have a cigarette. Sure I was legally old enough to smoke but my Dad would have threw a giant fit considering my grandma (his mom) and uncle (his brother) both died from lung cancer and emphysema at 55 and 58. My grandma died right in front of him before I was born so I never got to meet her. And my uncle died as my Dad was heading down to visit him. When my uncle died in 2012, I was not a smoker and that should have been my sign to never start again, except I did and smoked for about 7-8 years until I finally quit. 

There were times I'd sneak out to have a cigarette only to get paranoid about smelling like it and being caught when my family was in town. That's the insanity of addiction. There were other times I would go on a date with someone who had in their profile ""non-smoker"", ""no smokers/cigs"", or ""don't go out with me if you smoke cigarettes"". I just wouldn't smoke around them or make sure I didn't smell like cigarettes before the date. That was an added stress in itself. Even times when I'd go to the dentist, the dentist could tell I smoked due to stains on my teeth. So it goes to show that smoking does all sorts of damage than just lungs. 

Anyways, once I quit, it took a huge weight off my shoulders in many different ways, but a big one being that I don't gotta worry about hiding it anymore as I don't do it. I've just come to the conclusion that if you have to hide a habit from someone then it probably isn't good for you.",48

I’m trying to stop smoking and i was thinking that I don’t know much people who are successful in life AND smoker.

For exemple in my family: 

My mother and one uncle are both smokers, they are both depressed and unsuccessful in life ( my mother doesn’t work and my uncle works has a really bad situation).

They are both a little bit fat and never exercise

My other uncle and aunt, who both don’t smoke, are quite successful in life.

Uncle is business owner and started investing in real estate

My aunt has a master degree and a job she likes, good situation, living in Paris and visiting many countries during the year. 

They both love to run and participate to some marathons

I thought smoking was just a consequence but I’m thinking more and more that it’s the cause.

I came from smoking 4-5 cigarettes a day beforehand, so pretty light use, and my mind is now telling me 'that number of cigarettes isn't that bad, why not go back to smoking them, you felt better then!'.

Mornings feel worse. Yesterday was the same, my first full day working (I work from home) as well, and I'm very used to taking cigarette breaks throughout the day, I think that's what I'm struggling with most, not doing that same routine I've done for years.

The flight duration was only 3 hours. Very short flight, right? But not for my father who was a heavy smoker. I guess he was feeling really bad without his fix because he went to a toilet and tried to smoke there. Do you think it's okey? Have you ever tried to smoke in plane? My father returned to his seating place accompanied by a steward. He tried to make excuses. He said it was all just a misunderstanding. But of course no one would believe it. Now this whole situation seems funny to me, but I think then I felt ashamed. Pimply teens rarely have overconfidence, you know.  
A year later I became a smoker myself. While I was a student it didn’t bring me that much inconvenience, but when I started working something changed. At one of the jobs, I had to sit in my place for 6 hours without a single break. It's not very pleasant even for a non-smoker but for a smoker it's just torture. I'm sure you know how bad it feels when you want to smoke desperately but you can't.  Approximately once an hour, you could go to the toilet for 1-2 minutes. Sometimes I was desperate enough to take one or two puffs in that time. Do you think it helped? Yes, but not for long. The funny thing is: I was not the only smoker in this office. Lots of girls and guys suffered as much as I did. What a twisted sick world, hah? Why people so stupid? Why am I so stupid?

Today I vow to completely let go of you. 

When I was stressed, you calmed my emotions … so i thought … when I was tired, you woke me up … so I thought … when I was sad, you eased the pain … so I thought. 

What you really did was cause emotional and spiritual harm to my life. You distracted my thoughts, my reality, my goals, and my motivation. You took me out of the moment every single time I hit you. You brought disomfort when it was warm outside. You gave me a negative self image due to the thousands of times I’ve told myself, “I need to quit”. When I was watching a movie, you took me out of the moment, barely allowing me to finish. When I was working, you hurt my ability to be the best of the best. When I wanted to love someone, you drowned my emotions, not allowing me to display my love fully. You hurt me worse than any ex girlfriend ever has. You have distracted me to the point of no return. 

Now, I let go of you, and you are gone like the wind, out of my life. I only held onto you for 3 months, but it was a severely toxic relationship. They say to be aware of your relationships, and nicotine, you are the worst of the worst. You are blocked from my life. You are not allowed to call, text, or ring me anymore. I will not be answering. 

It will take me about 3 days to get over the tiredness without you, just like any other relationship. But after that, I know I will see growth like I have been craving, and like I was before I knew you. You, nicotine, were part of my journey, but now, you no longer serve me.",90

Basically all of my coworkers smoked and I got offers all the time. I didn't do it until I just thought fuck it, I'll try it once. That was a mistake as I ended up enjoying the headrush and starting bumming off them. Then I bought packs myself and you know the drill.

Earlier this year, I quit after smoking on and off the previous year as the pandemic made me think about my lungs and how it was a waste of money when I was getting my Covid cash from the government. I felt happy and I started feeling way more better after I quit.

A couple days ago, I was offered a cigarette by my friend and I thought I may as well just take one as I haven't been addicted to them in ages. As soon as I felt that puff come in, I felt sick to my stomach. To the point where I felt like I was going to vomit. I gave it back to friend and told him to finish it. 

Looking back at it now, I am happy that I am not addicted anymore and the fact that smoking makes me sick now instead of happy. My question is did this ever happen you?

TLDR: Relapsed after about 7 months and I felt sick after my first puff",6

I think a lot of people are afraid of quiting because they think that they will change for the worse. That as persons they will be only pathetic shadows of their former selfs. What do you think? Is it true or not?   
Maybe the most significant change for me is that I became more spontaneous. It became easier for me to go to new places. When I was a smoker I used to think all the time about when I can smoke the next cigarette. Now I can enjoy things that surround me. Take a closer look at them. Etc.

I do not get why that is such a scoffed at method of quitting.  Not all methods work for everyone, but it might work for someone, and writting that option off for everyone is never a good thing, imo. Because for some, it might be the perfect solution, and they might not be able to suceed otherwise. I do not get why so many science/drug journalists do it. Granted its much more complicated than just diminishing the amount of cigarettes you smoke (there is an entire method to it that I can get in to if you're interested) but it has been known to work for many.

2021-09-05 18:32:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pimvap/45_days_free/,45 days free,"Just wanted to share what worked for me. I used Allen Carr, but went about it a different way. 

I had previously read Allen Carr's easy way to quit smoking, and while the logic made sense to me, I found that I would quickly be back smoking again in situations where I still felt that romantic connection to cigarettes (with certain friends, after work, having some beers), which would then quickly lead me back to smoking all the time. Then i tried something else....

I started Vaping, obviously thinking that it is the lesser of two evils. However, as many would know I found vaping actually increased my nicotine intake due to the ease of which you can do it at work, inside etc etc. After vaping for several months flat out, I was starting to get mouth ulcers and not feel great generally. I realised something needed to change... So I again turned to Allen Carr. However, this time I got the audiobook of Allen Carrs easy way to quit Vaping.

Since starting vaping, I had broken the social addiction to smoking, for example at bars, with friends, on lunch breaks at work, I would vape instead of smoke, and, without realising it had been several weeks since my last cigarette. This was important as it allowed me to see my addiction for what it was, a pure nicotine addiction. Previous attempts to quit, I had convinced myself that it wasn't smoking I was addicted too, it was the social aspect of ""goin' out for a dart"" where your troubles would melt away and the conversation would get more deep and enlightening. However without even realising it I had been easily able to break this habit by simply using a different form of nicotine, which quickly broke that illusion for me.

This little change made the Allen Carr method work perfectly, because it was suddenly so clear to me that it was actually just nicotine i was addicted too (which has no real physical withdrawal symptoms after a few days) rather than smoking cigarettes. 

Combined with the fact that I believe vaping to be incredibly lame (and if you're a grown adult who thinks the rest of the adults watching you do it don't think you look like a try-hard teenager you are very mistaken).

It made the concept of quitting actually exciting, because that ""theres's nothing you're giving up"" line finally made sense. 

Anyway I am now 45ish days completely nicotine free, have had more energy, saved so much money, regained the circulation in my hands and feet and generally have so much more self esteem.

It may be counter productive to say start another type of nicotine to quit smoking, but if you are like me and its the social aspect holding you back, it may work for you!",23

I will be quitting smoking tonight. Its already 11:30 here and I intend on smoking my last before the clock strikes 12. I have been trying very hard to quit for quite some time now. Many times a week I will break down and commit to quitting smoking, only to give up the next day. The worst part is, I don't smoke because I feel compulsion, I just say what's so special about today, why not quit tomorrow or tonight again and this has been happening to me a for 6 months now. I am writing this post hoping that it helps me keep myself accountable.

I know smoking is bad for me. I used to workout quit regularly but ever since I increased my consumption from half a pack to 2 packs a day, I am barely able to do anything. I spend so much time in smoking that I can't focus on my work at all. I used to be a start performer, now I am sub average at best. In a firm as competitive as mine, this means a one way ticket to being promoted to customer. On top of fucking up my health and career I am also fucking up my mental health as well. These constant near every day defeat have nearly tanked my confidence. 

I pray to God that today is the day I smoke my last cigarette, but  I am not sure if I can hold down for a week.

2021-09-05 11:22:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pif0tx/two_week_update/,Two Week Update,"Good morning all,   


I am now two weeks into my life as a non-smoker, and it's fantastic. I made my introductory post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/p9mbpk/advice_and_encouragement_needed/) and my [one week update here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pdwrih/one_week_update/).  


Last Sunday when I wrote my one week update, the week had flown by and been extremely easy. I was stoked at how well I'd quit smoking and didn't have a worry in the world that I'd ever go back. This week was slightly different.   


Certainly it is still true that I won't be smoking again, but this week there were a few times in the evening where it just seemed like it was something I was supposed to be doing. I went and sat outside in my chair out of habit. I was aware that I wouldn't be smoking but I am still not used to the idea that I don't have to stand up out of my chair every 45-60 minutes. There was one instance where I was contemplating getting my car keys and driving to the gas station, but I reminded myself that I didn't want to be a smoker again, and within two minutes, that settled. No big deal, but I showed signs of a crack there.  


On Friday, I went to a buddy's place for a bbq and a lot of beer. He was smoking constantly as he does, and me? Well, not only did I not have a cigarette, ask for one, or ask for a drag, I didn't even want one. It was completely out of the question! I was not only capable of sitting there drinking without having one, but I now know that I can be in its presence and not be shaken. It was wonderful. I can completely trust myself to never smoke again it seems.   


The worst was when my buddy forgot to get more smokes when he got the steaks. He had to go make a separate trip for more smokes after getting the food. It reminded my of that feeling -- that panic about not having enough. I didn't envy that in the slightest. I am so glad to be done that. And I still have no doubts that my last cigarette ever was 2 weeks ago at 9pm.  


As mentioned in my update, I have saved my smoking money and put it into an index fund. I am now actively calling that my Ferrari fund. It's at just over $220 now (in two weeks), and should be enough to get me a Ferrari in 10-15 years (It might be a used one, or I'll wait longer). That's gonna be a cool present to myself for quitting.   


Looking at the smoke free app, all the health improvements are listed, and noticeable. My teeth are whiter, breathing has improved a lot, and energy is way up. In last week's post, I mentioned that my energy was through the roof to the point that I had to add runs and walks to my general workouts. That is still true, but either I'm more used to it, or it's stabilized -- there's no way to be sure of which, but I'm happy with it. It's a huge life improvement.   


The most shocking number on that app to me isn't my 3 days of life regained just by not smoking for 14 days. Nor is it that I'd have smoked 333 cigarettes in that amount of time, it's the *time spent not smoking* number. **How the hell would I have spent 28 hours smoking?!** The calculation makes sense at five minutes per smoke, but holy smokes is that a waste of time/life. Over an entire day out of my two weeks was used on smoking. And that isn't adjusted for sleeping time or anything, that's just 28 hours gone. So in the *life regained* section, it really should include that. Smoking isn't life, it's an annoying curse that subtly takes over every aspect of your day. And takes full days from you very quickly.  


So all this being said, I am two weeks smoke free and I am yet to find a single downside. Cigarettes do nothing but kill. I went from smoking 25-30 per day to zero with ease and I really hope more and more people make this decision. I want everyone to experience life as a non-smoker. If I can do it, even for two weeks, so can you.

I'll be doing another update next Sunday when I am smoke free for three weeks. I think I'm going to keep these posts coming for at least three months. Thanks for participating in my journey.",22

Something that I've noticed and been struggling with is boredom. I used to go out on my patio with a cup of coffee and sit and listen to a podcast like every morning. I would go out throughout the day and have a smoke in between doing chores around the house or whatever. Now, I don't have that. There's nothing to ""break up the day,"" so to speak. It's hard to explain. Has anyone else felt like that?

We even went out for drinks yesterday and even though I really really wanted to smoke (and him as well) we both didn't. I feel kind of proud and as if I got back a little bit more control about the situation. However, I am still annoyed because the cravings can be overwhelming and in those moments my thoughts get extremely irrational and I really expect to fail again and then this would all be for nothing again.",2

I started smoking even though I have severe asthma about a year and a half ago, because almost everyone does it here. Even though I knew how it was, I didn't want to be left out. Almost twelve years of not smoking went down the drain.

After smoking half a pack daily for around a month and a half, I had to use my asthma can around 3 times a day, and once a night. I knew I will give up smoking for good when october starts, because I have to go back to college, and I want to lose weight/spend less money/fuck bitches. But something bad happened two nights ago, which made me realise time doesn't forgive or understand you.

I was in the bed, chillin at 4 am, having a wank. Suddenly, I had to cough. I knew I had to get up, find my can to get air. But I coughed so hard and I felt like I had so little air, I started to feel dizzy and I started to panic. I was alone, no one at home, and I felt like even thinking was making me consume air. I calmed myself down, went to open a window to get some fresh air, and thought about what happened. I felt trapped in an open cage. I got angry with myself, like how stupid are you, man? You have health problems and tons of other stuff, you want to experience a lot of things, and this is how you want to go down? You want to get killed my SMOKING? Crush those cigarettes, and don't even think about smoking another one. That's what I did.

Yesterday, almost late at night, I thought about smoking a cig. Firstly, I said no. ABSOLUTELY NO. By time, I was like yeah man, one to see how it is. Why I didn't go to the shop was distance, as the shop near me closed.

I am so pathetic, I don't know how I can go through this addiction. Relapsing thoughts are hard when I want a cig... I guess that's how natural selection picks it's people, like me.",3

Finally, I got a mental breakdown or something. Everything annoyed me that day. Evrything seemed ugly and pointless. I was totally unable to focus. I smoked one cigarette after another but it didn't help. Maybe before that I didn’t want to quit because I was afraid that my condition will become worse. That I will lose some pleasant moments and inspiration. But that day I realized I had nothing to lose. Except my nicotin chains, lol.

I just learned about the existence of this subreddit and decided to join as it seems like it would be a lot of support!  


I'm proud to say that I haven't smoked in 2 weeks today! (from 1 pack everyday).  
Well, that's not entirely true...I had half a cigarette when I was buzzed with alcohol but to my surprise, I hated it and couldn't finish. It made me really nauseous and the taste made me actually want to throw up, so I take that I a good sign for my redemption.  


I feel like I'm at the peak of withdrawal side effects, with extreme anxiety that led me to the ER yesterday. It was a panic attack (chest pains, extreme dizzinness, could barely stand up and couldn't controll my breathing), all tests came back normal and the doctors explained to me that it can be a side effect for people who stopped smoking recently...and that it can last up to 2 months.  


So it's not fun, but it's reassuring.  


  
On the plus side, I have been feeling better. I'm not doing much exercise, but I can already see how (apart from the anxiety episodes) I am able to control my breathing better, I am no longer grasping for air after a simple walk around the bock. And, not the end goal, but I'm saving money...every plus is good to take \^\^.

This sub already motivated me to stop smoking few months ago but sadly I got back into ( a night out with friends after long time not seeing them and I didn’t even try to resist ).

I also used to smoke cannabis every night for 3 months, but I stopped for a week now.

I’d like to stop cigarette too, I know it’s going to make me feel better but I’m wondering if it’s a good choice to do it now.


I’m currently in the tough situation:

My girlfriend started school in a city 4 hours away from my hometown, and I decided to go with her.

We currently don’t have accommodation so we’re living in Airbnb week after week. 

This situation is extremely stressful because I have to handle everything about accomodation ( my girlfriend is a foreigner and doesn’t talk my language which is French ), I have to handle work, and I have to handle her: she is really sensitive and cause me lots of stress.

I really felt bad the past 10 days ( since we moved to her school city for finding a room ). I almost thought about going back to my hometown and leave her. But I’m kind of responsible for her.



I know that I would feel way better if I stopped smoking, more energy and less anxiety but I’m worried that I would freak out during the time I’m trying to stop.

What kind of things do you do to motivate yourself to stay away from the cigs? I think having some kind of goal aside from the obvious health benefits of not smoking would help, but I'm not sure what that goal should be.

I have made a list of allies who will help me when the moment of the final battle comes. Things that will help me to cope with boredom. Here they are:  
1. Writing everyday about my experience of quiting smoking. I keeps the brain in good shape and grants support of the community, which is very helpful.  
2. Running. I don't like sports, but this is war, nicht wa? Nobody cares about my preferences. I must run at least 5 minutes per day(yeah, it's not much) to keep myself in a good mood.  
3. I'm a fan of animals. So to entertain myself I can also read and translate articles about lizards, octopuses squids and other cool creature.  
4. And finally cubes. I have a dream to have a pet. To have a rat, if you want me to be more specific. Everyone know that rats are fans of mazes. So I can make few mazes. It's not hard after all. I can use paper and glue to make some small cubes, than connect them with more glue or duct tape or whatever.

2021-09-03 19:11:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/phg2ar/im_quitting_part_3/,I'm quitting. (Part 3),"Hello, forgive the robe, I know it’s not proper attire for our meetings but I’ve just stepped out of the sensory deprivation tank and was offered one. I never refuse a robe, you see, not only is it at the height of bad manners, but it is also a great disservice to the self. But let’s stay on track. Remember that business I told you about wrestling my nicotine-addicted brain in the senseless darkness of a tank? Well, I’ll tell you all about it if you’re interested. Have a seat, please.

Well, it was a flop! Mainly. I’ll explain. All was quite enjoyable at first. You enter and check in with a young lady speaking to you in polite hushed tones…

She asked if I’ve ever done this before. I responded with a firm no. We made our way through the cavernous place—evocative of Antelope Canyon—in search of my designated room. It’ll serve to know that I was cranky, for I was missing my nicotine and because I stupidly made my appointment for 8 AM. We found the room at last. A shower was to the right and before me, a large, white, sci-fi-like pod lit with blue LED strips. The lady continued speaking but I didn’t pay attention (remember my crankiness). She finally left and I got right to business. I stripped took a shower, sat in the pod, closed the lid above me, and lied down as if ready for my cryogenesis.

Surprised by how effortlessly I was floating, I relaxed. Vaguely, I recalled the lady mentioning something like a ton of salt being responsible for the density of the water. And of course, I would go onto splash a bit of it in my eye. I climbed out of the thing—naked and blinded and vulnerable—in search of the towel. I spent a good fifteen minutes stuck with the searing pain. As I cried and regained my vision I noticed they had provided me with earplugs. The lady too had mentioned them, but again, I hadn’t listened, it was all coming back to be with a massive delay. So, I plugged my ears, which had already become like a pair of slide whistles, and gave it another shot. This time I was fully ready to face my addiction in the great void of conciseness.

Of course, I would just go on to fall asleep. Nothing truly life-changing happened in the pod. I didn’t face any flaming-haired, white-torsoed, orange-butted demon, as I expected. But—Yes, there is a but—it was after being awoken by the gentle Siri-like voice coming through the underwater speaker and the subsequent reignition of the LED lights that something happened. I got into my robe. And just a few minutes before you came in, I had an epiphany. I know, a man like me doesn’t seem like the type to get epiphanies. But I did! Perhaps it was due to the robe, and its empowering freedom.

I realized that my whole difficulty with quitting nicotine had to do with Grief. I truly was grieving.

And I was grieving at 1RPM. Yes, I mean Revolutions Per Minute. Let’s walk.

Alright, I know you know where this is going, but bear with me. I agree it’s a bit of a tired cliché to bring up the stages of Grief. But I must summon them in order to explain the aforementioned epiphany. They go like this: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Right?

I went straight to google, here in my robe, and found a reassuring quantity of articles equating grief and the quitting of smoking. I mean, it’s not hard to believe they might be very closely related. After all, the brain doesn’t have an extensive cocktail menu. Insofar as we can tell, on the feel-good menu we have only but two cocktails, dopamine and oxytocin. Nevertheless, I was relieved to some extent to find that perhaps it wasn’t all a fault of my character. That I could put some of the burden on this theory of grief.

What I failed to find, however, was someone reassuring me that it was normal to find myself in a revolving state of grief. Does Elisabeth Kübler-Ross mention this in her book? Have you read it? Can you educate me?

Back to the 1RPM business. Remember they go like this: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Well, I go through all five stages by the minute in no particular order. Right this second, as we speak, I’m bargaining What if I just smoke one cigarette a day? How bad could that be? Maybe, just on Sundays? Now, I’ve jumped over to anger. I’m furious that I even had that thought, to begin with. I should know better than that! Now I’m depressed because I shouldn’t be this weak!

You see? Does this happen to you?

Let’s sit down.

Let’s breathe in this clean air. *Fmmm… Ahhh!* I think the sensory deprivation tank really did me some good.

I scorned myself for romanticizing and speaking of smoking’s beauty the other day, but it is now clear that I was getting at something. If those of us who are quitting truly are, in some sense, grieving, I suppose we ought to treat it much like the departure of a loved one. We often hear the platitude “Go through the process” yet since we are already indulging in clichés let us admit it into practice. Let’s go through the process. Let’s look back on our smoking days with love. Let us remember fondly those times we enjoyed a cigarette with a friend or, more enticingly, with ourselves. When the weather was just right and we swam into that blue smoke that would beautify a sunrise or texturize a night sky. Let us accept our love for the cigarette. Yet let us accept that it is over. It must end. Ahead, new things await us. Such is the game.

*Fmmm… Ahhh!*

I realize this might be the last time we meet. There might be nothing to say about the matter, it could just be a cycle of the same stuff.

As I mentioned the other day, I have a visit to the beach and the gym on schedule. I will be going there now. Maybe we’ll run into one another sometime. But for now, I think that what we’ve left to do is just trudge. Trudge forward one step, one revolution per minute. I cannot thank you enough for coming to visit these three days. I wish you the very best, my friend. May call you that? Yes? Oh, that relieves me a great deal. My friend. Remember the 3D model version of myself? Who knows, perhaps next time we run into each other I’ll have become him. Goodbyes are always though—us addicts are really bad at them, eh? Anyways, I’ll be keeping in mind this thing about grief so that it doesn’t catch me by surprise when it hits again in a minute.

*Fmmm… Ahhh!*

It’s hitting me now, in fact. Okay, I won’t make you stay any longer. This is it. A good, proper, formal….

It's my 4th day after 17 yrs of chainsmoking.. Minimum 2 packs a day to a point where I was carrying cartons in my luggage if I was travelling... 

Tried to quit multiple times but failed. Patch, pineapple, e ciggs, hookah nothing works on me. Now it's the toughest time in my life where I lost my mum to covid 3 months back, dad has medical complications which need attention asap, my business is in ruins, I have a huge debt on my head, I have an axial tear in my left knee which is pending and a 7-year-old toothache had finally revisited twice last month. 

I was forced into avoiding smoking for 5 days after a complicated dental surgery with a fear that it will complicate my toothache for a lifetime. I was eagerly waiting for the 5th-day but now I am hoping I can kick this habit once and for all.

Yesterday was mum's bday, baked a cake for the 1st time but had to throw it due to a foolish mistake. Later I found out that dad had made a very critical mistake in his life savings (investment). The anger, stress, and anxiousness really kicked up the urge to smoke. I am trying not to cave in but now I find myself awake in the middle of the night going through Reddit and asking everyone to place a bet on me. 

50:1 if I start smoking
5:1 if I don't

P.S. I don't think I can do it... But again it's a do or die for me...",15

2021-09-03 17:01:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/phds7t/four_months_and_going_strong/,Four months and going strong,"In the US here.  I found a post on the Book of Faces where they were looking for people to participate in a Phase 3 B study for cytisine.  Cytisine triggers the receptors in the brain that nicotine does. I signed up and completed 12 weeks of the double blind study.   IT WORKED. My quit date was one week after starting the medicine.  The first thing I noticed while I was smoking and taking cytisine was that I didn't want to finish my ciggie.

What is it? It is from a tree root. It is over the counter in most of Europe and Canada. In Canada it is called CRAVV.  The first week was hard, but I made it through with little cravings. Here is how I did it.

1. Treated myself as if I was sick. After I finished work, I ate and went to bed. Slept a lot.
2. Drank A LOT of water. Water, water, water. Want a ciggie? Drink some water.
3. Chewed a lot of gum.
4. Acknowledged that I was addicted to smoking. It wasn't a nasty habit. It was a dyed in the wool addiction and needed to be treated as such. Quit. No going back. Talk to your support system when you are weak, but acknowledge it is an addiction.

The side effects were mild. Heartburn that was easily treated with Tums or Prilosec.  Insomnia which I treated with over the counter Unisom.  Aside from that, nothing. No crazy dreams. No stomach upset.  No change in mood.

Here is the kicker. I smoked every day for FORTY YEARS! I did not think the trial would work, but I was desperate to try anything.  I had tried (and failed) in the past. I tried with Chantix but the side effects were too hard. This time it just feels different. I can honestly say I have gone a day without craving a cigarette.

So, hopefully cytisine will be approved by the FDA for OTC use in the US. The Canadian price points for a one month supply puts it cheaper than a pack of cigarettes per day. I may not have explained that well. I mean to say it's cheaper than a month supply of cigarettes. My test group was 12 weeks of taking cytisine 3mg/3x day.

If you are in Canada or can have a Canadian friend send you CRAVV, DO IT!!

Good luck and may the Force be with you to all the people out there on this journey. I know it is hard, but you can do it!

PS: If you are in the process of quitting by cutting down, Do Not Relight a Cigarette. The nicotine is much higher in a short than a regular, unused cigarette.",33

Hey, how y'all doing? I'm 11 months smoke free, one more month to join the ""long-term"" quitters club I think?

I've had weird physical and psychological symtomps all these months, I still have some of them, I still crave ciggartes too, you know what's also happening?

I can't stop thinking about how godly a ciggarette felt after a plentiful meal, in a cold and rainy day, after sex, the very first ciggarette you smoke after you wake up and after you arrive in some place and settle down.

Alas, I felt ""the best"" during all these occasions, but here's the catch folks, when I wasn't smoking and I wasn't feeling ""the best"" , I simply felt ""the worst"" 

I fucking hated when I wasn't smoking, I hated when I HAD to wait until I can light one up, I wasn't really alive unless I had a burning stick inbetween my fingers.

Now, I simply feel ""good"" , when I'm not feeling ""good"" , I only feel ""bad"" 

it's more balanced, more dull, more grounded, no crazy bursts of dopamine and happiness, no crazy moments of wanting to kill everyone else in my sight, I still have many questions I seek answers for, for example am I doomed to not feel ""the best"" again in my life? was life meant to be lived this way? I don't know, and I will in some day. 

Thank you for listening, I hope you all are ، good.

TL:DR : 11 months smoke free, life is kinda balanced, no extreme ups no extreme downs",5

I'd like to give you this romanticized story of why I quit (maybe for another post) but for right now there are two topics I'd like to discuss. 

1. I am a runner, hiker, walker. I have been sonfor the last 5 years or so. Even at the height of my smoking. Before that, I worked in the restaurant business so I've never been shy about standing on my feet. 

In the past year and some change, my leg will be hard to walk on, stiff, and sometimes painful when I smoked. I quit in April and in July took a trip to celebrate. I couldn't believe how much longer I was able to walk and run over my vacation. I relapsed 3 weeks ago when I transitioned back into work and now I have made it through a week of quitting. My leg has no pain what so ever and I don't do the bouncy leg thing anymore. 

2. I have had only two ear infections in my life. One after I quit in April and this week after quitting again. This one was much more painful and I think the ear pain alone will keep from relapsing ever again. In fact, I can say with almost complete certainty that I'm done relapsing and I have QUIT. Everything else be damned. 

3. I gifted myself a Garmin watch for exercise last Christmas so I constantly measure heart rate, sleep, calories, etc. The number one thing I noticed after I relapsed this LAST time, was sleep. I would sleep 6 or 7 hours but it would show that I only received like 3 hours worth of good sleep. Smoking cigarettes before bed had totally messed up my rest. This past week of quitting, I have slept sometimes 11 hours of the day. 

I realize that sleep differences are probably pretty common but I've never spoken to anyone who has experienced the leg or the ear thing. Anyone got any experiences with that?",3

The problem I find is that once the box is locked for the preset time, you can't open it. So if you buy another pack of cigarettes you can't put the new pack in until it opens again, so if you are prone to chain-smoke then you can do that until the box opens again which could be hours away or all day.

Anyway just wondering what other people's experience with time delay safes are, whether they really work. I know even one a day isn't really quitting. And I'd be better off with nicotine replacement, but I have done one a day for like a week at a time so it has worked. Just wondering if it can work long term because I do break down and end up buying more packs before the safe opens sometimes.",1

I have stopped smoking several times before. I am on day 6 again. Cold Turkey as I always do.

I was thinking about all the previous times I started smoking again and it is always the same pattern.

I quit smoking. Somehow I find it fairly easy. I know the cravings only last a couple of minutes so I white-knuckled them. On the first few days I have a craving every hour or so by the 2nd week is once a day or every other day. So I know I just need to keep going until I realize I am not thinking about smoking anymore.

So I get cocky. It's normally on a night out when I am drinking with friends after being smoke free for a while. I think to myself... Oh, I've not smoked for X amount of weeks/months, let me have one drag here, it will be fine, I am not addicted anymore.

Famous last words.

I do not know what happens to me. Maybe I will just have one cigarette on that night out but it's like if I woke a little craving monster inside me. So it's pretty much guaranteed that I will begin to reason how if I just bought a package it wouldn't be so bad as I can always stop again and all that crap. And one of the lies that I tell myself is ""nobody will know"". Because I feel deeply ashamed of my stop/start relationship with tobacco. And I will buy some cigarettes and I will smoke again.

So I know that I cannot smoke. I just need to make the decision not to smoke ever again. Day 6 eventually will become Month 6 and hopefully Year 6.

A poisonous mist crawled inside my head. Everything seemed blank and meaningless. I hoped it would get better, but it didn't get better. Day after day life was bleak and everything seemed disgusting. On the third day I was completely run out of willpower and started to smoke again. My second attempt to quit was very much the same. But on the third time something changed.  
Yeah, it still wasn't easy, but I was noticing that it was going so much better then my previous 2 attempts. I was able to enjoy reading and conversations with friends. I didn't want to pity myself, instead I took walks and was doing some joyful things. What was the reason it was so much easier for me? Well, I don't know for sure, but I have some ideas.  
Previously I thought that quiting smoking it's all about health and money. And to be honest I didn't care much about health but I had problems with money. So I felt like quiting smoking it's not really my decision but rather something I must do because of external circumstances. My attitude was like: I like smoking, but if I don't quit I will be punished. So the process of quiting was a lot like punishment to me.  
But then something happened. I was kind of depressed. And kind of bored. Pndemic, you know. I was sitting at home most of the time. And I was chainsmoking one cigarette after other. One after other. One after other. I mean really, every 15 minutes or so. Well, maybe every 20 minutes, but still. I realisied I'm really sick of this shit. And then I read some books about smoking. And I realisied something. Previously(what a naive fool) I really thought cigarettes are harmfull for health but they make your mood better and increase concentration. I thought health and money is a price I pay to feel better. And I was quite ok with that price. But how surprised I was the moment I found out cigarettes make your mood worse and dicrease your concentration. So... what's a point? Maybe that's why third time it was much easier for me to not smoke. My attitude changed. I was no longer thinking: smoking is great, but if I continue smoking I will be punished.

You know, English is not my native language so it's not easy for me to write in it. When I was a smoker it was so hard for me to concentrate while writing in English. I needed to take breaks and smoke every 5-10 minutes, because I believed without this shit I can't write a word. And now look, I wrote it all in one go. Life is really better without smoking.",19

Not even pleasurable.,"Lot's of stress, but this whole month has been like that. Today was quite the doozie. Something happened just now to trigger my irritability and I figured fuck this. Someone in my house has a pack and I took one. Not even my brand. Smoked half of it and it wasn't even enjoyable, didn't even calm me or give me what I thought it would. Put it out half way. Still though, from a pack a day to zero for a month isn't bad. I don't feel like I threw all that away or anything. I won't be buying any. In a way I'm glad I did so I don't have to pine after them. Now I know for certain; cigarettes suck. 

This almost reminds me of how I quit for 10 years before this. I was so frustrated that I smoked a pack as quickly as I could and got incredibly sick. Intense nausea and a panic attack. I just laid there thinking I was going to die. For 10 years after that I didn't have the slightest craving at all. Even around my friends who would smoke. Even if I was out drinking. Every time I want a cigarette I'm going to look back at today and remind myself that they're shit. 

My motivation was absolutely self destructive. Like a more socially acceptable form of cutting or something emo like that. Never. Fucking. Again.

Stay strong, people. Fuck.",22

i know i should stop smoking for myself and i really want to, but it’s hard (duh). he’s a major factor in me quitting so i guess that’s a good thing. i am doing it for myself, whatever.

i bought the nicoderm patches and i was doing great, and then i just caved after some personal stress.

throw some words of wisdom please. or a joke. 

are there AA-type groups for stopping smoking? not only am i powerless against alcohol but also even worse around cigarettes. i don’t drink every day but i can’t remember the last time i went without smoking unless i was deathly ill.

I started smoking 3 years ago, at 28, like a fool. First an odd one while drinking, then rolling, then regular packs after a while. Last few months, I was at 2 packs a day, on my way to chain smoking. I ""tried"" to stop smoking a few times, but I guess I really didn't want to stop. 

Last monday, 23. 8., I decided to read Alan Carrs book and quit on the spot. Threw 3/4 of pack to thrash and never looked back. The thing is - I don't have any cravings or withdrawal symptoms at all. I'm just fine with it. All my usual triggers for smoking are still here (stress, boredom, coffee, hanging out), but I  just have no desire to smoke.

I've been reading this subreddit and I'm kind of worried how some people have horrible withdrawal and cravings, and I just managed to stop. I don't think about cigarretes, and if I think about smoking, it's just a fleeting thought which goes away in a second.

I know I kinda sound pompous, but I really don't intend to light one ever again.  Anyone have any similar stories?",1

2021-09-02 16:27:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pgq0qp/im_quitting_part_2/,I'm quitting. (Part 2),"According to google it takes your body three days to be rid of nicotine…I promised I’d be in better shape this time around. Eh? What do you think? You smell that? Fresh, mountain air! My skin’s looking better, no? Step in, let me show you around. What’s that? Oh, that fence-and-tarp covering that dusty area over there? Never mind that. Let me give you a fresh tour of the place.

To start at the top, my nappy hair has undergone some slight improvement already, although, that might be due to my increased ingestion of liquids. A new habit: Oral fixation by way of a variety of zero-cal sparkling waters.

My skin—did I already mention that? I didn’t?—Okay, well if you haven’t noticed it’s looking a little better after just three days, can you believe it? It’s a new landscape on my face, new roofing now without my pores having to act like chimneys to the chemical factory I had running in my mouth and throat.

Which takes me to my teeth and gums. They feel significantly less septic, which has improved my self-esteem a great deal. The kernel-like teeth are still sporting their bronzing, but now that that journey is less futile I might be more motivated to get on the whitening caravan (*Ick, I’ll become one of them, you know the type I’m talking about*). Going lower, the noticeable improvements extend to a wellness in the throat, something that’s easy to take for granted. I remember how much I felt the need to cough and spit just a few days ago.

Recall the length of the nicotine flush I mentioned? While I looked at that I found some other facts of the home-improvement type (not necessarily smoking-related): Skin cells are replaced every thirty-nine days; Red blood cells are replaced every one-hundred and twenty days; And the entire skeleton is replaced every ten years. Crazy, no? A sign that we can really, truly cleanse ourselves from the abuse of chemicals down to the very core of our beings, literally. Together, one day we can be the proud owners of an all-new, non-smoking, clean energy, eco-friendly, TSA approved body!

(Oh, the lungs, you wonder, apparently it takes them up to nine months to repair. That’s quick if you ask me. But don’t quote me on any of this, I just googled things with a delirious need for validation. Google images at that too—a graphic—I couldn’t even bother reading a proper article)

I could keep going with my graphic-borrowed stats—it’s very interesting, actually—but as soothing and sobering as my visible improvements and scientific facts can be, they can only do so much in the irrational mind of a smoker. Stats are nice but have they ever really affected us? Have we ever really cared? We’ve known them all along! I can prove to you how irrational I am by admitting that I genuinely think smoking is a beautiful thing. I have to accept it. Rehabilitation is all about being honest, no? Or maybe it is that life is beautiful and cigarettes just give that fact an additional emphasis. Smoking can be an enhancement of a sunset, a walk in the night, a morning coffee. Isn’t it? It is. Please don’t shame me. *Alright, shame me, I deserve it.* 

It is often brought up that these feelings come from being brainwashed by Hollywood and what lingers from the days when cigarettes were advertised favorably. But I would argue that the sensuality of the cigarette came *before* the advert. Let’s not mistake things here. The beauty is intrinsic, for not even science—humanity’s most beautiful practice before singing and smoking and storytelling—has been able to turn us off to it. Cigarettes are beautiful…but…much in the same way, maybe, that a mushroom cloud can be beautiful; or a snotty, smoggy, phlegmy, apocalyptic LA sunset can be beautiful; or solar flares; or a tragic life.

Forgive me for talking about the beauty of smoking again. Am I repeating myself? It doesn’t escape me that I might sound like some nihilistic teenager but I promise you the sentiment is more mature than that! Will you take me on that promise? I’ve not a good track record have I? Well I’m changing that now, aren’t I? I’m *sorry* I’m not in as good a shape as I expected!

Forgive me for yelling at you, you’re the last person to deserve it. As you can see I’m still dealing with a bit of irritability as part of the withdrawal process. This comes along with spells of attention deficit and a displacement feeling that I can only compare to that of when you hop off of the treadmill after a good-masochistic session with it. You feel the world rolling and moving without you, enjoying itself without you. That’s how I feel. Left behind, unable to appreciate the world around me without the slim companion limping on my lip.

The truth is, with all my attempted optimism, (which I know it might not be much), in the brain, the nicotine telephone still rings every few minutes. If I hadn’t anything to do I could ignore it more easily. But I’m trying to get on with my day! Shut up, okay?!

It looks beautiful outside. It calls for me.

It was nice, enjoying the sunset without a cigarette. Which says everything about the beauty of nature but nothing about the sweet company of a cigarette. But I have to carry on.

When am I going to believe that quitting was a good idea? I keep wondering.

*The morals Gernoymous! The morals of it all!*

It’s getting late, thank you for stopping by. I know I said I’d be in better shape, believe me, I was, but things shift by the minute over here. In an instant, a traffic jam. A cursing protester. Sirens. Telephones. Emails. Mail. Money. Bills!

Three days and counting for me. No, actually, 4320 minutes and counting is more like it. Let’s catch up later, I have things to sort out. Thanks for stopping by. Drive home safe. Your presence was almost as enjoyable a cig. Thanks for putting up with me.

You keep looking at that fence-and-tarp? Huh? Alright, whatever let’s walk over there. I’ll show you.

Behind it, I’m building something. A new me. I’m just embarrassed about it. Anyways, yes, a new me. Here, see this picture zip-tied to the fence? It’s a 3D rendered model of what I’ll look like in the future. Look at the set of choppers on me. Look at me, I have healthy 3D modeled children and have promising prospects to get to know my grandchildren too! I’ve also, in this picture of the future me, acquired a new physique since part of my growth has included going to the gym and eating more subtly and therefore healthier. That’s what I think eating healthy is about, subtlety. When will I get my super-human tastebuds back? Do you know? Search it up and let me know. Anyways, back to the 3D rendered version of me, I have radiant, young skin too. I know the 3D artists were too nice to me, but who knows! Don’t laugh at me.

It’ll take some time to get there but I will be completed someday. A man of great habits I’ll become! You don’t believe me? I’m starting this coming week. Look over here, we have a list of our next construction phases for the coming days:

*One: Finally try the Sensory Deprivation Tank and wrestle your nicotine-addicted brain.*

*Three: Go to the beach and get in touch with your non-smoking-child-self*

*Three: Go to the gym and produce some ethically-sourced dopamine you lazy bum!*

I’ve already appointments in schedule and all. I’ll tell you all about it next time. Why, yes. Thank you. Thank you. That’s alright. Thanks for coming. Sorry for taking too much of your time. You’ve been lovely. Until next time.",25

But I decided to go for a run with my dog once. After less than two km I was out of breath, I thew in the towel and told my dog I was sorry, but I was never doing that again. 

A few months later I was a week into my nth attempt at quitting smoking after being a smoker for 7 years. I happened to see the app on my phone (Rundoggo) that I'd used to log my run. Curiosity got the best of me, and I laced up and went for a run. My distance was *a tiny bit* better. 

Running was the most direct way I found to measure my progress. Nothing else compares. You can feel when your lungs are done, when your body is out of oxygen and you have to stop. And you slowly feel yourself regaining that lung capacity and you can see the progress in a measured way - in km and minutes and seconds. 

Obviously not everyone can go running, but if you can and haven't considered it before, I really encourage you to! A doggo always helps. 

Keep up the good fight my friends.",62

Today it's finally been 2 years i have quite smoking.... First attempted after 17years of a heavy/daily (even when hospitalize) consumption...

I'm happy and enjoying the additional time i got. Getting used to go around with less objects. my skins looks amazing... this grey face just left for a peachy glow...  


But i still need to keep myself aware that, this strong addiction, is waiting for me at any moment... I’m still ( even if it's less and less) leaving "" dangerous"" setting to be sure I wouldn't smoke.    


I know it's still a big weakness, that i can fall back at any moment. I do know that even a puff on a cigarette would lead me to a pack in less then a week.....

2 years ago I went cold turkey.. Cried everyday for 2 weeks and couldn't believe how many action where starting and/or ending with a smoke. How I could repeat the same action more then 25 time a day... which other actions would I repeat 25 per day for 17 years....

 I wanted to have a special day with my close one's to ""celebrate"" and enjoy this special date for me... While proposing a different activity, the main comment received has been: How come you are still on this, you are a none-smoker now....   


It's so so wrong, I will never be a none smoker. I m a smoker not smoking. I still fully enjoy the smell of warm smoke, cigarette, cigar, weed what ever.... I find my mind fantasies on smoking 1, to enjoy the coffee, to congratulate or to come over a frustration. I find my mind creating great excuses to have one....   


All this to say, I am happy I over come all my addictions and manage to have a more or less    healthy life, but mainly I'm grateful I have the capacity to identify when weakness is around the corner. I will keep reminding me that I'm too weak/addicted to ever taste it again...

Idk. Just too depressed to quit right now I guess. And it’s so easy to smoke here. $4 a pack. Smoking areas everywhere. 

I guess what triggered it was a couple days ago my dad telling me he’s disappointed in me for trying to commit suicide a couple months ago and having to take time off work because in his eyes, I was the kid who was gonna make everything good in my life cause I went to college to work in Japan and that was my dream since I was a kid.

To be honest, I'm tired of smoking. I'm tired to be nervous about buying cigarettes all the time(what happens if closest shop is closed?). I'm tired to be not able to do literally anything without damn cylinders of death(literally, I need to smoke even before I can wipe my ass, lol). But most of all I'm tired of drinking things.

I find smoking most enjoyfull when I can drink something while smoking. Coffee, tea, milk, beer, etc. So if I'm not in hurry I always drink something while smoking. And I smoke a lot. Something like 25-30 cigarettes per day. It means during  day I drink something about 25-30 cups of coffee/tea/beer/water, right? No. Actually I drink a lot more. Because everyone knows that coffee dehydrates. Thus, for every cup of coffee, I drink one or two glasses of water. So I drink, I guess, about 50 drinks per day. It's not a problem until I need to go out. Because when I need to go out I have a lot of water inside of me and I'm afraid that I will piss my pants(yeah, I know how miserable that sounds) if there are no toilets in place where I am going. And I actually like to go out. I like to take walks, go to cinema, concerts, etc. I'm not extraverted, but sometimes I just need to get some new impressions, you know. And I can't do that. So.

This year has been horrible to me : I have been on the edge of being fired the whole year (I have been fired now), I bought an appartment with my gf and we realised that there was a lot of work to do (much more than expected), I had health issues (that are not over yet), my gf had trouble with her familly, we have been bummed out together quite a lot this year and we have faced challenges that are not over yet.

Still, I didn't smoke. I got enough problems, no need to add cigarette over it.You can make it.",79

I tried to quit smoking multiple times but something in life would stress me out and I'd relapse after a week or two. This is probably my 30th attempt at its been a week so far it's going okay but I'm having this Burning sensation in my esophagus that I want a smoke and I'm making up excuses so that I can relapse..so of anyone who just quit I'd love to hear how you did it and the things you did to distract yourself from the urge..,2

I'm making the steps towards quitting (again). I'm having some trouble because smoking is pretty intertwined with my art and writing, so it's a challenge to undo those behaviours but I'm working on it.

I quit for 4 years up until about 6 months ago and prior to that smoked almost a full pack a day. I think I only quit because I moved country and everything was new, but I made sure to internalize the positives of being smoke-free.

I think what I miss most about not smoking is breathing properly. I walk a lot and it's often through a very steep wood. Despite doing this daily for months and (now)being relatively fit, it's still much more taxing than it should be. That sucks. 

I'm also pretty paranoid about my mortality generally. I have things I want to accomplish and it sucks to think that I'm actively contributing to that ending prematurely. I have a fortunate/unfortunate reference point in my grandparents, in that respect. They're both lifelong smokers that are pushing 90 and haven't had any cancer scares or anything like that, so it's hard to silence the part of my brain that tells me that I'll be fine too. I know it's just a lottery and the risk is not worth it, but you know how it is.

Anyway, I bought some patches. I got the low dose even though I smoke about 8 a day atm. I've been supplementing that with the occasional cheeky smoke with the end-goal of cutting them out entirely as I work on changing my behaviours. So far so good. I found that the medium dose made me feel really nauseous and unable to work, but the low dose seems to be doing the trick so far.

I've found that mindset is important. I'm pretty pessimistic as a person. My smoking is very much tied to the notion that ""life is short and pointless so why try"" kinda thing. I know that this is only really relevant for the first month of quitting. From experience, after the first month and beyond it gets SOOOOO much easier.

Anyway, thanks for listening. Good luck buddies.",3

So I've recently decided to cut down and try to quit smoking. I've been smoking 4 cigarettes a day for the last month or so, and I am going to attempt to quit using Allen Carr's audiobook. I've been listening and honestly find it a bit dated, but some of the arguments are good. My main reason is for health. I've been using a vape recently, but still smoking as well, and I think that's been causing even more problems. I've been having palpitations, and just feeling very nervous, and I'm pretty tired of not feeling 100%.

The last couple of days I've smoked 1 or 2 cigarettes, but I have a history of anxiety, and I've always used smoking to help with that.  But the thought of quitting, and going without cigarettes makes me so anxious, it's hard to focus on work, and I feel very jittery.

One thing I'm also worried about at the moment is that there won't be anything as satisfying as a cigarette when I am smoke free. I want to get over that fear of emptiness which quitting puts in my head. 

What is something you enjoy as much, or more than a cigarette after quitting?
