I am a dental hygienist, and I am doing some research into the use of nicotine gum as a form of nicotine replacement therapy to quit smoking. I just wanted to get some first-hand information from people who actually used nicotine gum as a means to quit smoking. 

I have many patients who I see who smoke, and I want to be able to give them the best information possible that comes from real people... not just information written on the internet by companies trying to sell a product. 

I want to know;

1. Did nicotine gum help you quit?
2. How long did you use nicotine gum for? Example: how many months or years did you use it for? 
3. Did you use any other products/methods to quit? Example: vaping, hypnosis

Thank you SO much for your answers in advance. I really appreciate it. I never want to scold or make people feel bad for using tobacco or nicotine products, all I want to do is give people information that may help them if they ask me questions. :) 

Thanks again,

ESCAPING an addiction. 

- Are non smokers being deprived of something by not smoking? 

- You only smoke for the relief of withdrawal pangs which you created by continuing to smoke. There is no actual relief or boost. It fools you into thinking the opposite. 

- May be tempting to have just one more cigarette but it will start you off again and cost you £40.000 over the course of your life. 

- Every cigarette you light, you are closer to the bomb exploding. How do you know if it’s the next one?

- You won’t feel insecure about smoking. Think of when you walk with a cig and people are behind you

- You’ll have more energy!

- You’ll have more concentration 

- You will be able to respect yourself 

- You won’t be paranoid that you smell of stale smoke 

- Your breath will smell better and your teeth will become whiter 

- Your skin will improve 

- We assume we enjoy them only because we cannot believe we’d be so stupid to smoke if we didn’t enjoy them. 

- The enjoyment isn’t from the cigarette itself, it’s from ending the agitation caused by the craving 

- Cigarettes are enjoyable only after a period of abstinence 

- Smoking is a drug addiction 

- Cigarettes create the symptoms they relieve 

- On bad days remember smoking is not going to cure it. You’ll just feel shit for having started the chain again. 

- Cigarettes create the void. They don’t fill it. 

- Pangs are a craving for poison. It is the beast dying. 

- You will still think about it but that’s not a bad thing. Just rejoice that you’re a non smoker and that you’re not giving anything up. 

- You’ve absolutely made the correct decision

2021-10-30 18:10:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/qjbtgu/failing_after_doing_pretty_well_first_67_months/,"failing after doing pretty well :( first 6-7 months of the year tobacco clear, then weed has been the conduit to relapsing, and now it's daily again and finding it reeeally hard to stop again :(","I started reading Alan Carr towards the end of last year, without any real intention to quit. By the time I got to the end, on the 2nd Jan, that was it, I was done, I threw away my tobacco and gave up, totally motivated. The year before I had quit a daily weed habit. 44 yo now, smoking tobacco daily since I was 16 ish, weed socially which also increased to a daily habit by the time I was in my early twenties (ironically, it was an ex girlfriend 'making' me give up tobacco, we lasted a day (less?), then naively thought smoking a spliff (with tobacco) was ok. stupid. three days later I got back on the tobacco with a newly found daily weed habit.)

fast forward 20 odd years and I hadn't gone an hour without smoking either, ok with some control over the weed, but pretty much. Something inspired me to give up weed in 2019, which was crazy difficult, but I managed, and at least had tobacco as a crutch to get me through. Quite a thing after being a little bit high (but mad productive tbf) for 20+ years. 

Anyway, after going a straight 6 months without weed, after 'mastering' the addiction of it, it would then be smoked very rarely, mostly socially, or with a drink at home, and was quite a creative, enjoyable thing, and that to me was fine, I kinda wanted to be able to enjoy it recreationally without being addicted to it. 

Then giving up tobacco (in rollie form) this year, arguably made a lot easier with lockdown, as socialising was minimal / non existent. Sometimes if I had a drink by myself, I would smoke a bit of pure weed, but never tobacco, and I was fine with that, I would return to totally non-smoking me the day after, so felt like I had it under control. Then at a friend's birthday a few months in, a friend shared a spliff with me, weed and tobacco, and wouldn't you know, it was the freaking sweetest thing ever, but nonetheless, I still maintained it as a social thing, kind of a one off, and didn't again for ages after. As lockdowns were lifted, and socialising more, so to would the smokes, sometimes with tobacco, but would only ever happen every few weeks, sometimes even less often and I was quite happy I could have a bit of fun, smoke some weed and tobacco, and return to non-smoking me for weeks after. This was the dream. 

However, eventually just smoking when I was out, turned to 'oh I'm a bit hungover, I'll have a smoke this morning', so once a week became the weekend, became 4 days and so on, and stupidly my rule was no rollies, only if there was a bit of weed involved, (because then i wasn't motivated by the tobacco).  One weekend I was working at a festival, a creative and quite a solitary experience, and out of nowhere I started smoking actual cigarettes ( i haven't smoked / liked actual cigarettes in freaking decades, just tobacco smoking, but had some old cigs with me to mix with the weed as I reasoned at least I wasn't carrying tobacco with me and would be less tempted to smoke tobacco by itself), but even after then I returned to most of the week not smoking.

I've totally lost it over the last couple of months, all kinds of excuses to smoke, and stupidest of all, 'well I'll just smoke a rollie, as I don't want to get high' <facepalm>. I saw it was a totally out of control,  daily thing again, gave up for three weeks, but then caved again, and have been smoking every day again for the last couple of weeks.

I've been away from home, (family holiday etc, 'ah a hotel room to myself, might as well smoke every day here!') but am about to return home tomorrow and hoping as that's where I successfully gave up, with all the new routines and habits I've developed to help me stay off it, I can again, though conversely, that can also be my place of zero restraint, which it has also been. 

Insomnia has been a big factor too, as nicotine and weed has gotten back into my system, it's been worse than ever, sleeping absolutely zero hours whenever I've had an early start, sometimes now for no reason at all (erm, hello! nicotin/weed withdrawal!??) and it was this happening at the beginning of the holiday that made me think eff it, smoke, better to 'enjoy' it and be able to sleep then be miserable on an expensive holiday I can't afford because of crazy insomnia. I am looking into hypno therapy and melatonin dosages for the insomnia. 

What worries me is that I don't seem to  have that motivation and drive I've previously had and been able to return to. Even when I did smoke, I knew I was going to return to non smoking me. but now.. 

I was SO proud of myself for giving up tobacco this year, as were my family. I really hope I can return to it, but equally now I can see I am hoping to return to not smoking 90% of the time, and just socially, but I've proof now of where this invariably leads.

Now on day 2, of no nicotine...","I had cut down drastically since July this year.   First, I stopped buying cigarettes and started rolling smaller my own tiny cigarettes with a small filter.  That helped with the barrier of having to roll your own vs just grabbing one from the pack at any given moment.  Then I started rolling hemp spliffs (tobacco with hemp) which helped a lot with nausea and anxiety from nicotine withdrawal.  The most difficult thing was the depression and low energy/brain fog I was feeling which I took ginseng and St. John's wort for.  

Next, what happened was I got a dry herb vaporizer which I smoked mostly the hemp and barely any tobacco at all.  A dry herb vaporizer heats the tobacco at \~300C as opposed to combusting the tobacco at  900C degrees + , you get the nicotine but none the carbon monoxide and noxious smoke.   I was going to stop smoking altogether and just continue to vape.  But one day I accidently left the vape at someone's house and so I was craving nicotine.   I still had some rolling paper and loose tobacco and I so  I decided to roll my tobacco again, and then I also had this juul (an e-cigarette).. I was smoking normally as I would for about a few days, until couple of nights ago I definitely overdid it and smoked way too much nicotine than normally I would have vaped in one day and it also gave me really bad insomnia.  Ironically too much nicotine plus the lack of sleep made me feel like my heart was racing.  I had to take some blood pressure medication to feel alright.  Now when I look at the tobacco, it just makes me feel like it might take my heart out.  I really hope I do not pick up another cigarette again... 

It hasn't been a straight path of quitting/cutting down but I am on Day 2 of no nicotine now.  I feel like I'm getting a head cold and I'm very sleepy.   I am drinking a lot of chicken soup with ginger, ginseng (powder), turmeric and garlic... and lots of decaf chai/roobois tea--- its helping a little bit with the congestion.  I hope to continue to heal.

Overall, I’ve been greatly reduced for the past year. I used to smoke about 4 cigarettes a day on a work day, probably more like 6-8 on weekends. This total divided between actual cigarettes from a pack, and daily spliffs (weed and loose tobacco mixed together). 

When the pandemic started, I cut out the cigarettes, but kept the spliffs. I tried switching to joints but it just didn’t hit the same (obviously…cause I was addicted to nicotine lol). When I started being able to see friends again, the cigarettes came back into my life, socially only. But I still smoked about 1/2-1 spliff each day on my own. It was how I winded down from work. 

A few weeks ago, my boss got Covid. I work in his home and was exposed. (Myself and everyone in the household who is of age to do so is vaccinated). Weirdly, I also got an extremely intense respiratory illness, but I took two PCR Covid tests a few days apart within the recommended time frame, and both came back negative. It was the first time I had been sick in a long time. I coughed so hard that I threw up a few times, and burst the blood vessels in my eyes. 

Ever since then, my anxiety has been through the roof. Every time I cough, I think I’m gonna throw up. It has happened a couple times, though mostly I can cope it away (it’s coming from a mental place). I basically convinced myself I have lung cancer. And every night, my brain had a battle with itself. The addict part saying “You need to smoke. You have to. It’s what we do. You can’t skip it.” While the anxious part was saying “Please PLEASE don’t smoke tonight. You’re gonna make us throw up. You’re giving yourself cancer. Please I’m begging you to stop.” And it’s crazy how strong addiction is. It can overpower even the part of the brain that is literally trying to preserve your own current safety. I kept smoking these last few weeks, and would cough and feel sick, and the cycle was just fucking ridiculous. 

But five days ago, something finally clicked. All of a sudden, the part of my brain that doesn’t want to feel nauseous every day from coughing finally defeated the addict voice. I got home and looked at my spliff rolling stuff, and just thought to myself “God dammit, enough is ENOUGH!!! You don’t even enjoy this anymore, stop fucking doing it!!!” And admittedly, it’s not like I did some amazing healthy thing that night. I just laid on my bed and watched YouTube and tiktoks mostly. But as I did that I was like “wow, this doesn’t even feel that different than when you smoke.” Because my tolerance is so high from a decade of daily spliffs, you know? 

And I got through an entire workweek smoking nothing. No spliff, no cigarette, not even a joint or something. And each day, my anxiety lessened. I no longer felt like breathing was causing me to need to throw up. 

I finally fucking did it. 

I have a lot more I could say about my relationship with food and how smoking weed plays into that, but suffice it to say: while I struggled pretty bad with that early in the week, I’ve improved greatly and have been eating closer to a normal amount in the evenings. The daily calorie count is still far too low, but it’s okay, I’ve got plenty of extra weight on me to get me through, lol. And I’m taking vitamins. All this is so much better than the zone-out binges I was having after smoking every night. 

I have energy, I can breathe, I worked out three times this week and didn’t feel sick after. I just turned 30 and while I’m a bit disappointed in myself for letting this plague my 20s, I think I’m still early enough in my life that like…this is pretty good. It all feels very hopeful right now.",61,"{'pandemic': 1, 'covid': 2}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9945429563522339}"

I used to say that I liked the social aspect of smoking and how it'd go hand in hand with drinking. Sure, those parts may have been enjoyable at the expense of the other times. 

Some of the things I don't miss about nicotine addiction is when I'd run out of smokes and then fighting the urge to buy a pack despite costing $14-17, only to cave in and do it. Or the other times I'd be at work and if I didn't have any of my own cigarettes, I'd go out of my way to offer someone a dollar for a cigarette, which I felt pathetic doing. 

Then there'd be times where I'd get irritable if I had to hide my smoking habit from parents, dates, and other people that would approve of it and look forward to them leaving so I can have a cigarette. I wouldn't vocalize it but internally I'd be craving really hard. 

When you don't smoke, you just don't think about these things and it's truly liberating. For example, when I get off work, I just look forward to going home and winding down and watching tv as opposed to ""needing"" a cigarette before I go home. I didn't use Allan Carr's book to quit but having read some parts after I quit only reaffirms my decision to quit. 

My biggest takeaway is to not envy smokers or miss it. When someone smokes, they are looking to bring themselves to a state that non-smokers are always at, and it couldn't be any more true. Not to mention that using nicotine, of any kind, only increases cravings not reduce them. It's foolish to think otherwise.",14,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.984736979007721}"

Just posting because well.. I quit four days ago and I was supposed to start work two hours ago and have been struggling through the nicotine-related blocks. I'm just writing to get this off my chest and share with the community because there's nobody else in my life that understands. 

It's not right to call them cravings, I think. Its also not quite right to call it withdrawal. I've been smoking for ten years since I was 16. Before and after every class from Junior year of high school through college and work since. Mostly cigarettes in high school, then working with a hookah at my desk 8+ hours a day through college, to mostly 5% - 6% salt nic vapes for the past two, three years, which - had the advantage of being able to hit virtually non-stop during the day.

 Before I started using nicotine, I was using cannabis for another 2/3 years  before that and have since used it continuously as well. 

Between the two... I feel like my brain literally doesn't know how to function in ""everyday reality"" without them. Every few moments is spent trying to release this deep-seated panic like my brain has to be re-trained to deal with baseline reality when nicotine has been my entire coping mechanism. Not even for anything specific, but in contrast to any degree of self-regulation. 

I don't think I'm about to fail. I know this release and re-training is a path to a kind of liberation. But god damn. This is more than just putting something down. This is more than ""just"" an addictive habit. This is fucking full-scale cognitive restructuring in either direction, right down to our most basic physiological habits of breath and sympathetic nervous system activation. I feel like I need a whole-ass month-long retreat just to learn how to breath and function like a normal human being again. 

In the meantime.. I guess I'll do a shitty job on work and hope I get better with my breathwork in the near future. Best of luck and best of wishes to everybody struggling, processing, or even just thinking of quitting out there in the community.

I’m convinced that i manage it this time. I’m expecting an increase in withdrawl the next 3 days and than slowly decrease. 
Currently slight headache with brain fog. A bit depressed. But I will stick in!

Update 1: (22h)
I‘m feeling ok, lot of carvings and my head is buzzy. Everything a bit heavy but no problem.
(Definitely not nice, but flue or so would be much more worse). Lets see how I feel tomorrow.

Update 2: (30h)
Its 02:50 in morning but I have troubles continue sleeping. But buzzy/heavy head is gone. I also don’t know if I’m warm or cold.
I will try continue sleeping. Give update later.

Update 3: (41h) 
After a sleepless night I’m a bit tired but in general I feel good. I have no problems to normal interact with people or to perform tasks. Head feels ok and I feel like I’m more calm. Cravings still here but definitely not as much as yesterday!

Update 4: (50h) 
I feel good today! I was in morning a bit stressed out, my emotions wens slight up and down. But nearly no buzzy feeling. I‘m really ok. Everybody who would like to quit, it’s a bit „not so nice“ but mainly your brain want to trick you into going to get nicotine. But I think it is only easy when you really know you will quit.

Update 5: (72h -&amp;gt; end of day 3)
I had an easy day. I‘m actually feeling good. I just keep reminding me it will get better. 
It’s just a feeling of not completely enjoying. 
I hope I sleep better tonight. 
If there is anything significant changing I will post, but so far it’s definitely manageable. I mean only several days not doing something what you like to. It’s nothing more

Update 6: (day 5! -&amp;gt; 104hours!!)
I feel good! I just got very less sleep. 
Only 5 hours. Nevertheless my focus comes back. 
I have situations where I usually consumed nicotine which trigger an urge to smoke! 
But I‘m still nicotine free and will not use it.
Next week by the same day I’m nearly 2 weeks in and should see giant progress in getting my life back. I will stay strong cause that nicotine is just fucked up!

Update 7 (day 12)
! I‘m still smoke free! I’m on day 11 and 12 hours. I only have cravings in situations where i used to smoke. After food, between work, or at the start of some other tasks. But as soon as the craving comes I think it’s over and it’s quick gone. That’s not the problem. I feel like I have no withdrawals anymore. I‘m just so absolute unmotivated.. maybe only the first hours of day I have a bit focus for my goals. I hope that gets better. I see that I have a new void which needs to get filled with something else.. 
I will do an update when I figured out what to do!
For new I only know I never go back!

Update 8 + research (day 14!)
I’m on day 14. I’m still bit unmotivated due to lack of dopamine (I guess due to dopamine production into vesicles prior to exocitosis into synaptic cleft).

https://archives.drugabuse.gov/news-events/nida-notes/2009/10/abstinent-smokers-nicotinic-receptors-take-more-than-month-to-normalize
-
I found this, they did ct scans of brain &amp;amp; found that by the 12th week dopamine system is back to that of non smoker. It will start to normalise between week 6-12
I have read that a lot of people relapse on day 16 up to till day 24 so i will keep strong.
I will update in 2-4 weeks and will cover week 6-12 if there are significant changes in behaviour or feeling!

Update 9:
It’s end of day 27! Yeah. I should be proud. 
My motivation is much better. I started fitness training 3 days ago and doing good nutrition 1-2 weeks. I really haven’t got any cravings at all. Also not at tasks where I used to smoke! I think I overcome them quicker, when a craving hits by immediate reminding my self „I made a clear decision that I stopped, I have nothing to crave!“ and by doing that I overcame them more quicker I guess as when I would think ooh it would be so nice to Smoke. I actively tried to detach emotionally.
If you want to be successful you need to make a clear desicion if you want to stop or not! When you do that and you are done with it you just have to overcome the withdrawal and the lack of dopamine a while.
If you are in high yield job and you depend on your performance you may stop on a thursday and struggle friday a bit and relax on Saturday and Sunday. After one week same day you should be fine! Stop now, it’s not that bad, just a bit difficult.
If someone reads i will do update in few weeks when i expect my dopaminergic receptors to normalise. So I will tell you if something significant changed! See you (:

DAY 42: what should I say. I have NO cravings at all!
I feel that in morning hours I‘m really focused and motivated to do things. But after 14:00 it’s kinda tricky to keep up with things. 
I‘m starting now week 7. I had really good days. I‘m definitely gaining momentum but it’s kinda sad awakening what I have done to myself due to that fucking nicotine. It was completely useless and everyone should stop immediately!
I will see how my mood is changing in coming weeks. I think the adjustment to the new dopamine levels combined with a slight increase in dopamine threshold will lead to overall better performance and maximal day duration of workflow. I will see. Make update in few weeks. But I must say it’s not that bad at all. Compared to the times during nicotine induced workflow, the produced workflow without nicotine after 42 is markedly better!

The last couple days I’ve just been in this constant state of intense panic. I have a few other symptoms of withdrawal as well, like I’m almost constantly thirsty and have had a few minor headaches.

I’ve struggled with anxiety problems similar to this before but I’ve been taking venlafaxine for it which has helped tremendously. I’m mostly wondering is if this is because of nicotine withdrawal or a problem with my medication.

So 4 months back, I wanted to quit again and decided to log my whole journey so I used to log trigger and time when I smoke and over the the weeks data I see clear pattern and my mind was more aware of pattern and triggers, so after a week I decided I will try to distract myself with different techniques(dancing, drinking water, talking to friend, breathing exercise etc..), initially first week 80% of time my cravings were much powerful then my mind ... but I was keep doing and exercising the same practice and target one trigger at time( eg: I will not smoke after any meeting ) and overtime I realise that my mind is more and more aware of my habit that helps me to make my judgement to smoke or not on certain trigger... after couple week of practicing the same I was manage to smoke 20-30 cigarettes a day to 1-2 cigarette a day and now I smoke occasionally. And I thought what helps me can help others as well to control smoking, so I started building app for that cause, in first app version I am supporting below features

1. set daily smoking goal 
2. log every smoke with triggers 
3. analyse your trend - trigger wise, day wise and will provide you comparison based on past data  
   
  So anybody want's to give initial feedback to this android app? please comment if you want to test it out this app :)

Unfortunately every night when my window is open it sits right above where the guards smoke so I am constantly exposed to the smoke. Second: when I was running this morning there was a such a long line of traffic and I am constantly breathing in the exhaust fumes. All of this makes me feel really gross, and don’t get me wrong I have been polluting my lungs for a few years so I have no anger or spite with these things but it’s so hard to stop, knowing that I’m still inhaling all of this garbage constantly. Any advice? My main motivator is reducing health risks and being more healthy but this has been difficult to view from this point of view when I’m constantly exposed to this stuff. It’s just really discouraging how running and trying to do the opposite of smoking and being healthy I am still inhaling all of this toxic garbage and how I’m also literally inhaling second hand smoke while I sleep.

Today marks 3 weeks since I stopped smoking. I'm on 25mg patch and sometimes I miss smoking. I miss listening to music and smoking a cigarette, as a matter of fact a few days ago I was anxious and panicking and had a fear of depression and OCD returning ( I'm diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and have had depressive episodes before ) and all I was thinking about in that moment is to smoke but I didn't. I'm glad I didn't but sometimes I feel like I want to, I somehow miss it even though life is better now, no more anxiety over how many cigarettes I have left or other things, I have more time to do things I love and to talk to loved ones. 

I was a smoker for 2 years and by the end of it, I used to smoke around 20 cigarettes per day. Sometimes even 1 pack and a half or 2. I've may even got acid reflux or maybe GERD because of smoking since the last two months I've been having problems with acid returning to my throat.

I know that smoking is an addiction and that there's absolutely nothing about it that's worth going back but how can I remove that feeling of comfort that it gave me ( or maybe it truly didn't give me anything at all ) ?

I’ve been a cigarette smoker for about a year and a half, a habitual weed smoker for around five years, and a fairly regular drinker for at least the last three years.

One of the guys I tour with quit cigs with me two weeks ago, and we’re going strong on the no-cigs front, but here’s where I could really use some advice: 

I’m struggling to find a healthy way to cope with the extra anxiety that comes from nicotine withdrawals - I keep leaning on other vices more to push past the urge to buy a pack of cigarettes. I’m smoking more weed, drinking more, and overeating every night. 

I play a lot of brewery/bar gigs so alcohol is always free and easily accessible and I’ve already noticed myself drinking more at shows to take the edge off that I’d usually rely on nicotine to take care of. Yesterday, I opted not to drink during the show and I felt so restless when I got home - couldn’t sleep, walked for an hour, tried to get some work done - I ended up caving and getting stoned to calm down. I want to find balance and distance myself from all the shitty vices I’m leaning on. Do you have any suggestions for quitting nicotine without shifting the weight of your personal discomfort to other addictive things? Thank you!

I have horrible anxiety already and the additional anxiety around my health and the way I smell, am perceived etc. is too much to take. 
Tobacco is absurdly expensive in Australia and I'm wasting my money on something that is going to kill me   and is worsening my physical capabilities. 
I'm young and I don't want to keep putting it off because ""I've got time"". I don't want to be digging my own grave any more. 

I am done. I'm ready to get rid of this shit no matter what. I previously read Alan Carr's book and it was like an actual switch being flipped. I quit for a year until a particularly bad break up. I had that first puff and the work was all undone. I didn't even crave the nicotine, I just wanted something to fill the empty space. 

Does anyone have suggestions/tips for how to replace the one thing I think a cigarette gives me - a way to passively kill time? It doesn't require focus, my thoughts can still bounce around without taking away from the task at hand and there's a clear beginning and end, kind of a goal to  complete. It's satisfying when I'm by myself and anxious, not really able to collect my thoughts and it gives me something to lean on socially when I'm nervous (either to kind of stimulate myself or to act as a social buffer? I don't know how to explain it). 
Things like stress balls or fidgetty things don't work because they're aimless and also usually socially inappropriate. 

It would also be great to hear from anyone that's had success re reading the Easy Way to Quit. 

TLDR; what are some alternatives to filling empty space? Especially ways that will still work in a social situation where I can't just whip out my phone and start watching YouTube. Also, is it worth re reading the Easy Way to Quit?",12,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9990453124046326}"

He feels pretty okay on the non smoking aspect of things.

In the summer of 2019 I smoked around 4 packs a day, and today on average I vape four juul pods per day ( I dont use juul but thats the best way to quantify vape use imo ). 

Bottom line is that with recent federal legislation even vaping is astronomically expensive now. While I think its ridiculous we vilify vaping so much, I'm pretty much left with no choice but to quit. Partly because I dont want to allocate more per month to nicotine than I already spend, and partly because it pisses me off that congress can just control my life and what I consume.

My biggest hurdle is probably obvious to you by now, but I genuinely dont care about the negatives of smoking. I still love everything about it, even if I know that objectively I will benefit from not using it. 

Honestly what I'd like to hear is the positives yall have felt from quitting? Hopefully thatll re-frame my mind because past attempts to quit have all failed in under 24 hours for me. I think I fail to remember what it was like to not be tethered.

I dreamt I woke up on a beach, took in a big breath of fresh air, and looked out at the water, which was shimmery pink and blue, it was sunrise. I got up and walked along the shoreline, I walked along a pier, and said how I really felt like going swimming. I started back along to the beach, and said how I love not smoking and how I love the mornings now. I felt joyful, saw a child playing, thought how beautiful everything was. (Weirdly my ex was there the whole time and I was talking to them, I've only had bad dreams about them before but they didn't disrupt the peace of it at all, they just followed me around, felt calm for them to be there). 

Then I woke up irl, and immediately got out of bed and went for a jog, without having to force myself at all, I really wanted to and had a bunch of energy. I did the same today.
It was a simple little dream but I guess having that sentiment come through in a dream is a nice feeling. I've quit quite a few times before but always ended up having 'just one'.

No that has seemed to pass by I have this sadness about me recently. It’s not nice and is a pretty strong feeling. 

I have a couple variables in my life that maybe could be responsible for this as well but I think it’s from cutting my intake of cigs in half. I’m also having some anxiety.

I've previously stated that I was going to post weekly for three months in my Past posts.

[Three Weeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pmvom4/three_week_update/)

&#x200B;

And then I stopped. The reasons I stopped were that I got insanely busy at work and didn't have a lot of time off, but mostly it's that I just don't even think about smoking anymore. To sit here and write these posts is something that would have to be scheduled these days or I just won't get around two doing it. It's wonderful.

&#x200B;

My Ferrari Fund is now over $1000, I will certainly be getting one at some point in the future thanks to cigarette money saved. Still a ridiculous concept to me that not smoking can pay for a supercar over 15 or so years. But on the other hand, last year had someone told me that, it probably wouldn't have mattered. When I was a smoker, the idea of being a non-smoker actually seemed way more unattainable than a supercar. I'd always be able to afford one of those some day, although I'd neevr buy one without a fund set up for it like this. But not smoking? That seemed like a fantasy.

&#x200B;

Now though, I am a non-smoker. I don't think about it at all, I'm not tempted to have a smoke during all the natural cues I used to have (After food, first thing in the morning with coffee, commercial breaks, in the car, during intermissions.... I used to smoke constantly, all of these cues are really just excuses). 

&#x200B;

I'm not going to promise to keep writing these because I probably won't, but I can't express my gratitude to this sub enough for recommending Allen Carr. I learned so much about my addiction and the lies/delusions it was telling me. Smoking consumed me and didn't let go for all of those years. It feels so good having my life and mind back from that awful, awful disease. 

&#x200B;

If I can quit, and get to this point of not needing, or even wanting a cigarette, anyone can. And I'm serious, I wouldn't take a puff of a cigarette if paid $10000 right now. I don't want to be a smoker ever again.  It's just a matter of finding the right tools that work for you. I wish I'd have found Allen Carr sooner because that was instant to me. It really was easy to quit with those tools. I'd recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it. Get the audiobook, grab your smokes, and listen to it all in one shot. Just set aside 5 hours of your day and you'll easily stop smoking. At least that's how it worked for me.

Quick background: got addicted when I was in 6th grade and smoked a pack a day for 10 years.

Anyhoo, I've decided that it was time to quit this year as I wanted to be able to see my future daughter grow and go to college and whatnot. So I started with a Juul which went well and I was able to kick it off completely after 3 days or so but after a while, I've realized that my nicotine addiction got more intense and I was consuming more nic than I was w normal cigs, so I switched to freebase juice (lower nic levels) with a pod mod device.

After that point, I've decided to gradually decrease my nicotine intake until it's 0mg, and I was able to decrease it to 3mg in 2 weeks but then I realized the flavor had played a big role in why I vaped too much juice in a day, so I've ordered a special juice that had no flavor in it. It was a bit weird but I got used to it and reduced my daily vaping amount by half.  After that, I was convinced that I was pretty close to quitting completely very soon.

In the meanwhile, my Doctor had put me on a new medication called ""Wellbutrin XL"" for my ADHD treatment. I've started taking it and after 3 days or so, it was a Thursday afternoon, I just had my lunch and I've noticed that it's been more than 6 hours since the last time I took a hit from my vape and was pretty amazed by the fact that I didn't even think about it during that time.

So I quickly reached for my vape to take a hit and just thought to myself, ""why don't you wait and see how much longer you can go vape-less?"" and I liked the idea so I put it back.  And BINGO, that was the last time, months had passed and I've never touched it again. Threw all my vape and smoking stuff away and never looked back.

All that process that I've just told you about took me about a month and a half, from starting to Juul until having my last vape drag. But that doesn't mean that you can do it in 1.5 months as well, I was pretty aggressive and fast about it so it didn't take me long but it's different for everyone.  


Do I think I'd still be able to do it without the help of ADHD medication? yes, but it'd have probably taken me longer to do so, if you want fast results I'd suggest that you try and get a medication that has Buprion HCL in it.

The first week is horrible. The addiction makes sure of that. It tries to trick you into ""just one more smoke"", and everything is just aggravating and not fun. BUT that one week at the beginning is worth everything else that follows.

By my second week I remember getting in my boyfriend's car after he picked me up and turning to him; ""Wow you smell really nice today!"" I said, ""Are you wearing cologne?""

And he replied, ""I am. I wear it every day. I always wondered if you liked it.""

Just found this subreddit. I was addicted to cigarettes for a couple years, I smoked a pack a day for maybe a year, cut down a lot by rolling my own and vaping, and eventually fully quit sometime last year. I've bought a couple packs since then, usually smoked part of it, remembered how shitty it feels, and gave the rest away. 

I work at a restaurant and many of my coworkers smoke or vape and would offer me some. At first I didn't  see an issue with it but now I'm stuck with this problem/habit where for many months, I smoke almost like I'm addicted to it Friday- Sunday when I work (I do doubles all weekend and then get 4 days off lol) where on a ""good day"" I'll only have one cigarette but sometimes up to like 4 or 5 especially if I drink which we can do for free there when we close. And then go through withdrawals every Monday Tuesday and Wednesday, but my bf smokes cigarettes and recently I've been bumming some from him on those days and been close to being fully physically addicted again a couple times and made myself stop for a week or so before inevitably bumming more. 

I have no mental issue with going days/a week without nicotine if I'm not around it, I've done it very often. But I recognize the amount I'm still smoking negatively affects me almost every day and I've tried every strategy I know of to stop. I set up reward systems for going without for a week/2 weeks/a month, I journaled about how it makes me feel, I got hemp cigarettes, I told people not to offer to me. And even then I can't stop myself from asking at least my bf (we work together) at least once a day when I work. 

Any tips you can think of to give me? Any media you think would be helpful for me to consume? I wanna stop being a dick to my family every Monday 😕",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9973039627075195}"

2021-10-22 11:05:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/qdiv14/quitting_smoking_from_a_student_in_the_library_to/,"Quitting smoking - From a student in the library, to a student in the hospital","Nearing the 96 hour mark and this is the closest to quitting I have gotten in a while! I keep trying and keep failing, and every time I failed I said the same words ""just 1 smoke."" There was never just one. One quickly turns to two, two to three, and before I know it I'm at a pack a day.

&#x200B;

I still remember the first cigarette I smoked. It was 2018 and I was my first week into med school. We were celebrating with some drinks and my roommate pulled out a pack of cigarettes. I had never smoked cigarettes in my life, never wanted to do it neither. Whenever someone offered I would say ""no thank you"" and usually leave because I couldn't stand the smell of cigarettes. However, while a tad bit too tipsy I took a cigarette and lit it up. And oh man that rush that gets you the first time...it was incredible. Weeks went by and I smoked a cigarette here and there, nothing too serious, but then came the end of our first semester...exams were nearing, stress was high and I needed a damn smoke...and then another one....and then, of course, another one. Quickly in a matter of weeks I started smoking a pack a day till the end of that semester.

Then came my first break, had about a week off before next semester started and in that week I managed to quit. Barely touched another cigarette for the next 7 months, even my smoker friends would say ""No"" even when I'd repeatedly bother them for one. Then came fourth semester! The start of 2nd year with the largest hurdle over (1st year, particularly 3rd semester). I was at an all time high, stress was at an all time low, things were looking up! And then I thought, ""well damn, a cigarette would be good right now.""

And that's where the next 2.5 years of my life went downhill with smokes. Now I wasn't smoking because I was stressed, I was smoking because I was happy! In a fantastically idiotic fashion it meant I was smoking all the time for every possible reason! Again, within a few weeks I was at a pack a day! At least this time I had thought of an alternative. I was going to get a vape! I got some Juul with pods and started tossing those back 2 - 3 pods a day. It was great because I didn't have to leave my room to hit a Juul like I had to with a cigarette so I could just do it every minute of every day! Wake up in the morning and still in bed? Juul. Taking a shit? Juul. About to jump into the shower? Juul! Juul, juul, juul all the time.

And this kept up for the remainder of my 2nd year with really no attempts to quit. At times I went back to cigarettes. The feeling of lighting one up and taking the first puff. The delicious taste of ash in my mouth. I'm honestly not quite sure what it is, but there was just something about smokes that vapes just could not replicate.

My 3rd year though was where my eyes opened and I made several attempts, and of course, failed every time. 3rd year is when the game changes a bit. It's no longer locked in the library or in your room studying. No, now you're on the floor, working, interacting with patients and their families. I ran into a few attending physicians that smoked, you could smell them a mile away when they came back from their ""break"".  I wanted a break. I took my breaks. Cigarette in the morning after waking up, before I showered to be sure I didn't smell before I got to the hospital. Cigarette after morning rounds, didn't want my residents and attendings to get a whiff. Cigarette after lunch. Cigarette on my way home. Cigarette here, cigarette there, cigarettes everywhere!

Saw my patient dying of COPD exacerbation? ""Damn I could use a smoke after that..."" Patient with COPD and COVID has their heart stop in the ICU and I had to do chest compressions? ""Fuck I need a smoke."" How does that make sense? I don't know, you tell me...I've learned the negative effects of cigarettes. Hell! I have seen them. Lung cancer? Seen it. Head and neck squamous cell cancer? Seen it and assisted in an operation for it. Bladder cancer? Seen it, hell I even stuck the scope up the PP for it. COPD? Seen it. Aortic aneurysm? Seen it, seen it dissect, seen it rupture and even helped in fixing it. I know this stuff like the back of my hand, but every damn time I think about them ""I could use a fucking smoke.""

It's like there are these little cigarette monkeys in my head that start running around whenever they get a chance. I had always thought quitting was ""easy"". ""I just have to stop,"" I would say. I can start using smokeless tobacco like snuff pouches to wean myself down. I even tried that, went from using 1 8mg pouch every so often, to popping 2x6mg pouch every now and then (somehow managed to up the dose see? 8 just wasn't cutting it! And before I knew it I would be popping pouches while smoking cigarettes or hitting a vape.

But don't worry. ""It's easy.""

""It's easy."" Is the worst thing I have ever told myself about anything. Ever since 3rd year ended a few weeks ago I have had a lot of time to sit and think. It seems almost universally true in my life that when I say ""it's easy"" I get lazy. ""Losing and keeping weight off is easy!"" Proceeds to put on 30 lbs. ""Putting on muscle is easy!"" Proceeds to slack at the gym and atrophy like nobody's business. ""Damn this class is really easy"" Proceeds to get lazy and by some heavenly blessing still manage to do well.

""Easy"" is the worst word I had ever learned. Nothing is easy. This time I have convinced myself that this is one of the hardest things I will ever do. I need to quit and to do that I need to stay vigilant. No lapses, no relapses. If not for myself then for my patients.

I am at 96 hours. I no longer feel like murdering everyone around me. I think this is going well but I don't think it's going easy. This is unbelievably hard.",21,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.997261643409729}"

But the fact is, nicotine was creating anxiety and tension, and smoking another simply makes you feel the way non-smokers feel all the time.

There is absolutely no credible scientific evidence that nicotine helps with tension or anxiety. It is simply not true when someone explains that they continue to smoke because it helps them relax. It absolutely does not.

Ask any smoker who has quit and started again. With those first few cigarettes, you feel absolutely nothing, no relaxed feeling, no sigh of relief.

I was a pack a day smoker for about 8 or 10 of those years. The last year I am around 15-20 a day. Tried a few different strategies such as quitting at night. Quitting in the morning. Quitting during the day. Quitting on the patch or lozenge. Quitting while I am off work. Quitting while I am working. I am on champix now. I tried it years ago and it felt like it worked. Like I didnt feel like smoking but did anyways because I wasnt ready to quit. Ive been on it for 2 weeks today and it doesnt feel as helpful as before. Like it kind of makes me forget about smoking but theres still mad cravings every so often. I went 30hrs until this afternoon and cracked and bought a pack for no other reason because I am a little bitch and was being an idiot. I originally felt like if I could just get 1 day under my belt I would be able to beat this. Now I just dont know what to do or feel. Like youre supposed to pick a quit date within 2 weeks of champix and im there now and am worried it will not work if I keep smoking. Im a sober alcoholic (4 years tomorow 🤜🤛) and when I realized that I ""got"" sobriety was when I stopped counting the days I was sober because the time in doesnt matter only the today does. Im trying to have that make sense with smoking but it seems like its all about how many days it is equals your success. I dont know if that makes any sense. Alcohol for me was an acute disease. Absolutely binge drinking wrecklessness that could of killed me or anyone else in my path at any time. Smoking is this chronic addiction that takes a little bit at a time but isnt as near term devastating as alcohol is. So it almost doesnt seem ""that bad"" or that I must quit sooner than later even though I want to. Enough is enough. Just want some feeddback from others or maybe this post is helpful to someone else. I know its a tangent and not very organized post but its what came to me as I was writing.

I’ve tried to quit a few times before, but I’ve always gone right back to it. I think I’ve figured out why I was never successful. I didn’t want to quit. It was a comfort to me. I knew it was hurting me, but I wasn’t ready to let it go.

I'll go to the beach, or for a walk, and am so sad that I can't smoke that I'm not enjoying my day to day as much. I used to enjoy smoking and vaping particularly when I'm alone. 

You hear people who give up smoking or vaping say that they always miss it, but I really feel like I've lost an old friend and I'm hoping this feeling diminishes over time.

I'm hoping others can share their stories of how they felt while quitting, if sadness was a side effect for anyone else, and if I can expect this to pass. How long until I don't want to throw a tantrum and cry because I miss nicotine?

The other trigger is when I'm happy. When I do a task or get some good news in my ways i tend to celebrate it with a smoke. I am aware now more than ever that I have some serious work to do regarding behaving my urges.

These times came up in conversation the other day and we both commented that we really enjoyed those times. It made me nostalgic to smoke again so I asked my wife if she’d like to smoke again and she flat out said no. Later we were at a store, at a register where you could buy tobacco and I asked her if we should pick up a cigar, and she again was against the idea.

 I have been vaping 6 mil daily until yesterday. I feel like the last few days vaping was making me sick. Terrible cough, sore throat, and just very terrible taste in my mouth. Today I didn't vape at all but was craving it so bad. I didn't vape through my work shift outside of a single puff on my lunch break. 
 After work I went to the pharmacy and picked up the patch. I was hesitant due to the patch being 21 mil but the pharmacist told me because of how regular I vape going the strongest would be my best option. These are 24 hour patches. I put one on and within an hour I had an intense buzz that was dizzying and cotton mouth like I had never had. I'm about 6 hours in and I can't sleep and I'm salivating to the point I'm having to spit and drink lots of water to wash it down. 
 I don't know if this is withdrawal or a reaction to the patch. Any input would be helpful and could really use some support. I've never been this determined to end my addiction. Edit: I don't have covid. I've smoked long enough to know what throat irritation from smoking feels like. I haven't lost my tastes just that vaping tastes terrible. Edit: I did end up falling asleep and left the patch on but I feel fine this morning. Normally I wake up and reach for my vape but I didn't this morning and only have a mild tolerable craving.

Maybe some triggers I didn’t yet address properly? People I like and look up to still smoke… One is my dad, and I‘ve been visiting him more often this month. The entire flat stinks… Other is a close friend. She never told me she smoked but I kinda knew. Few days ago I “caught” a dirty ashtray in her room… I thought she was quitting, but, oh well…

I try to convince myself these urges are of the same kind as when I had never smoked, that made me start smoking in the first place. That I’m no worse off for having smoked before and been through the fight. But I’m still scared.

Im so glad that I could join because i can see lot of common problems we ex smokers face and lot of inspiration and encouragement from people who could kill this addiction for good. 

I have smoked for 10 years and most recent  rate of smoking was like two packs for three days. 

Since last year i was on a successful journey of quitting smoking stayed close to 5 months out of smoking 2020 june to December. And picked it up again and on and off couple of times. And stopped on my 32nd birthday 19th of 2021 and going on being a happy non smoker ever since.  Just 29 days. But every quit attempt counts and yeah there will be pangs and cravings but we should become bigger than the addiction. Trying to be conscious about my thoughts which immensely helps me on control acting automatically on usual queues which leads me to go and buy a pack.

somedays it gets rough and really tough, fighting with my own thoughts. But if some how I managed to overcome the temptation to smoke the next day it feels like a victory and make me feels like the next time its gonna be a lot  easier to neglect cravings and continue living happily .

thats all i got to say so for now. Wish everyone have  the courage and mentality to lose the desire to smoke which makes this whole process a lot easier. After all we are already non smokers aint we ?cz at this exact moment no body has that filthy stick in our mouths. 
So lets be happy in the moment right now and nothing else matters!

Today I had my last cigarette when my vape finally died and I couldn’t find my bottle of juice, I figured it was time. I bought a vape to quit cigarettes and made a slow climb down from 5% to 1.2% but today it wasn’t working so I smoked one last cigarette and I realized I hate these things. Why do I do this to myself? I get sick whenever I smoke any high levels of nicotine but I always crawl back like an abusive relationship. A lot of negative thoughts swarm my mind when I think about how weak I am in the face of addiction. Granted, there have been a lot of unfortunate circumstances I find myself in, but quitting these addictions would be a good step in the right direction right? Then why is it so hard to do the one thing I know will be good for me? Allen Carr’s book arrives in two days, I have been debating nicotine patches for a while but while growing up, I’ve watched my parents go down every route to try to quit and it never works. I don’t want to be like them in that aspect, especially since it still hurts to watch them smoke cigarettes and that’s something i would never want my child to experience, it a helpless feeling and it never changed as I grew older, I fact I think it’s only become worse as I understand more and more. I feel like this has become a rant I’ll wrap it up, this is definitely an impulsive choice to quit, but I’m worried that’s all it’ll ever be.

I took a pull off of what could easily have been my 30th cigarette of the day, and somehow I saw how disgusting smoking really is. The smell, my fingers, my breathing, that cough, that grimy feeling. I threw my smoke to the ground where it belonged and said ""fuck this, fuck this shit, fuck off"" and turned my back on it. I made that decision and I stuck to that decision. Not a puff since. 

The difference between this and every other time I tried to quit was a deep seeded feeling of determinatiin, that I was going to be  bigger than the addiction. I was going to be in control of myself and my actions. I didnt tell anyone either, not even my wife. She noticed at some point, but I think I went 3 months before telling anyone else. No added pressure that way.

For any numbers oriented folks, 30 cigarettes a day over 10 years is 109,500 cigarettes not smoked. Thats a fucking lot of cigarettes. Maybe 10+ pulls on each, that a million pulls...

I used to get up at night to pee and I would light a smoke, so if I can do it and keep doing it, it is in all of us, you just have to really want it, enough to put yourself in charge, not the smoke.

1) I’m clean and sober
2) Cigarettes, coffee, and chocolate were my vices.

I didn’t plan on quitting 72 hours ago.  No way.  But because of my insanely wild party past, I’ve had - to put it mildly - a lot of oral health issues.  Over the last few years I did everything you could do to beautify a mouth (and still smoke) except the one thing I needed to truly make my mouth whole again.  Bone grafts.  

The other day a front crown broke and I went to see my dentist.   I figured it would be an easy fix and I’d have my smile back.  Nope. They did some  x-rays and I needed those grafts now if I was ever to have a non-denture smile again.  So I had a choice.  Quit smoking on the spot or put it off and run the risk of losing all my teeth.

In a split second, I chose to quit smoking.  I ran outside to my car and inhaled my final two cigarettes.  My partner was with me so we threw anything related to smoking in a bag, brought it in to the office, and trashed it.   

I got the bone grafts and here I am almost on hour 72 and, yes, it’s really really hard.  I can’t do much in the way of movement or exercise because of the grafts.  I also can’t eat anything beyond smoothies/blended foods and my face is swollen beyond belief.   The past 12 hours or so have been brutal.  The cravings have reached a fever pitch and I’m floored by how powerful drugs like nicotine are.  I mean, my brain is throwing every excuse in the book to smoke at me.  Suns out?  You should smoke.  Have some work to do?  You should smoke.  Light breeze blowing through the house?  You should smoke. 

Outside of round the world flights I’ve taken, I haven’t gone this long without a cigarette since I started as a kid.  I’ve chosen to go cold turkey on this because my home is littered with patches and pills and lozenges and vapes all bought with good intentions and all barely ever used.  

As a recovering alcoholic and addict for many years, I intrinsically know that what I’m experiencing won’t last forever but damn if my mind isn’t telling me over and over that I’ll never feel normal again.  

Finally, addiction sucks.

I originally wanted to reduce the smoking, be it day by day, or week by week and have loosely been doing that, but it didn't work in the long term. I have also been using a product known as snus, a nicotine pouch placed between the gums and inner lip, that wasn't to reduce my habit of smoking though, I just wanted more of a kick out of nicotine, as I didn't really catch a buzz off cigarettes alone anymore. 

I now only use snus and don't smoke. This is day 1 for me. I still get to feel some nicotine and perpetuate the ritualistic habit the drug entails for me. This is my solution. 

It does however keep me hooked on nicotine. I don't crave snus as much as cigarettes though, so it'll be an easier transition to stopping my use of nicotine altogether. People used to tell me how tough it was to quit. I believe them now. It's tough, but possible. All you need is something to make the transition easier. Be it the occasional smoke or a substitute.

I was not a heavy smoker. I started with cigarettes (maybe a pack a week) for 2 years, and then I started vaping for the next 3 years. Oh lord did that got me addicted to nicotine. I was smoking 30mg at the beginning which is enormous. At the end, I was at 3mg. Then one day I told myself: after this bottle, i’m over. I did smoke 2-3 cigarettes in the first week of trying to stop, but after that, it was OVER.

First month was very hard. Me and my bf both stopped at the same time. We were literally screaming at each other permanently for absolutely no reason lol. But then, I started to feel less tired and weird when I woke up in the morning. I felt overall less stressed troughout the day (I still do sometimes due to an anxiety disorder) but it has been easier dealing with it.

Now, I hardly even think of smoking anymore. Sometimes i’ll see coworkers or friends do it and for a split second I miss it, but the thought of it passes as quick as it arrived. I never get urges to smoke. It’s always just a brief thought of it, and to be able to say no to it without feeling angry is so rewarding and feels so powerful.

What helped me get through it I would say is just the thought of having a better health, more money in my pockets, and tbh, a big ego lol. Also, i’m still super young (22f) so stopping now was the best thing to do for my future self.

In retrospection, this year has had its ups and downs, but hey, I havent smoked!!!! today i am also celebrating 7 days without alcohol!! If you really want to stop, I believe in you. You are stronger than this nicotine bitch. I hope you all a very good day :).

I’m curious to know this because I quit a little over 4 months ago cold turkey after smoking for 12 years (since 16), it was my first quit ever but the difference between me and some of you is that I didn’t want to quit.

I did it because of a health scare that turned out to be nothing and decided that I might as well just continue quit but i’m 4 months in and having a hard time still, perhaps because I didn’t have a goodbye or the urge to quit didn’t come from me but external circumstances… 

Anyway, this is my question to all people who’ve relapsed, did you feel like yourself again after you relapsed? Did it kill your depression/anxiety? I’ve noticed that people who relapse often stop coming to this sub, it must mean that they went on with their lives as smokers forgetting about the mental state of withdrawal misery.

After 4 months I still think I’m forcing myself to stay quit and I’m still unhappy because I don’t get to smoke like I used to (I’m still suffering from some withdrawal anxiety but nothing crippling, anxiety that was non existant back when I used to smoke).",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9958343505859375}"

I'd quit for 3 months at a time or more, then pick it up again and I've repeated this probably 10 times over the last 10 years.

I've never reached out to a forum or platform of any kind so I'm hoping airing it out a little bit will give me a greater sense of responsibility to stay off it.

The way i approached my exit strategy was simple, i switched to vaping and tried to figure out why i would smoke in the first place. Since i read that this is how you would approach any other addiction.

When i figured out why i smoked i could easilly quit but now even though i sucsessfully quitted for a year now without any feel of quit im right in this weird situtation and i wonder if people did experience the same.

I’m on day 6 (tomorrow is one week) and I’m proud of myself (probs the most ever). I’ve been mostly caffeine free for the years (sweet tea only), I am off and on with weed, I drink a maximum of one soda a day, and now no cigarettes. Super surreal that this day has come.

Here’s the story.. I started in middle school off and on and that continued increasing until hs. Senior year, I quit. Come time to go to bars and clubs, I was back to socially smoking. That eventually spilled over into every day life. Over the years, I’d set dates to quit. Like the back of the shampoo bottle, rinse and repeat. Tons of failures over the years (light failures because was my mind really there/ready to quit?). Then I set a hard date where I had to quit, that passed by which was last year. Then September hit and my brain realized I had just swept it under the rug like nothing and so at that point I made a promise to myself to quit by October 1st, but this time had to be different because I was just not going to buy another pack. Pack after pack the cravings pushed me to give in, but my rule was when you finish a pack you have to wait as long as you can before giving in. The longest I made it was 16 hrs without buying a pack. Last Friday hit, my last cig in the pack was around mid day and I started getting that feeling so I pushed it to the end of the day cig before bed.

The biggest part of it, in my opinion, is being ready. Nobody else can do that for you. For me, I asked myself if I want to smoke a year from now and it’d always be an answer of no, but I never pushed myself to do something about it. The second biggest thing is to talk to someone (in my case it is a friend) who has quit so there’s the relatable portion of knowing what its like.

Things are going well! In the last week I've only thought about smoking a handful of times, and none of them were particularly long or strong cravings. We had a friend over last Saturday who still smokes and it felt odd not to be joining him, but I wasn't feeling particularly tempted to. I sat out with him once just for the company, but the smell really put me off.

My anxiety and agitation are down. I'm having an easier time focusing. Things in general are looking up.

Hubby smoked half a cig a couple days ago at work after 11 days without. He said it made him feel like trash afterwards, headachy and nauseated. We talked about how the addiction lied to him. It told him ""your break will feel better with me"" and made him feel sick instead, which increased his stress the rest of the day instead of relieving it. I'm proud of him for keeping going. A stumble doesn't have to be a fall.

I hadn’t planned it, I woke up at 3 in the morning (not unusual for a smoker), breathing was terrible, and just thought I had to do this sometime…. maybe I could do it today. Went back to sleep but remembered when I woke up and gave it a go. I often had those thoughts at 3 in the morning… I usually ignored them by the time I got up. I honestly can’t tell you why it was different this time.. sometimes you just build up the will power.

I’m 45.  I’ve  smoked for 30 years… mostly 20 a day but probably 25 the past couple of years. It hasn’t done me any favours with my skin, hair, breathing, fitness, savings.  This is probably my 4th serious quit… I’ve managed 3, 9 and 12 months before.   I hope this is the one.

Im waffling on… the reason I’m posting is to give some reassurance to those a few weeks behind my journey. I found it really difficult for most of the first 5 and a half weeks… some good days to keep me sane but otherwise it just felt relentless. Never ending . Week 3 was particularly hard until I realized it was week 3 and just needed to get through it. Week 5 was a nightmare because I thought week 3 was supposed to be the worst!

But now, all of a sudden, it’s so so much easier.  I can focus on the positives of not smoking rather than constantly mourn the loss. Theres still a couple of times a day when I’d love a smoke, and I think about them often… that probably sounds scary but it’s not that bad at all… it’s not in that all consuming way of the first 5 weeks. It’s such a relief.  It does get better. It does get easier. I’m so pleased with myself when I remember that I forgot to think about smoking.

My husband is a very dedicated smoker so there’s always tobacco in the house… but that’s ok.  The trick is to remember that in x amount of months, when I think I can just have one, I can’t.  I hope this time sticks.

Another weird also happened. Maybe month ago i cant stand when someone smoke next to me. I never had problem with it, even before i started smoking. Also we had teambulding and one of my collagaues build pack of cigs. He normally dont smoke, and he just do it when he is drunk as hell. And me even i was drunk as hell i hadnt zero taste for it. 

Also if anyone wonders i smoked for ten years, last three years it was a pack/daily + im general stressful person been fighting with anxiety for a long time so if i could manage you could do it too.

Edit: also one funny thing to add. My good friend visited my at my place from another country. He is strong smoker and forget here pack of cigs and full pack of tabacco for rolling. I have it here stored for him and could care less and thats also great feeling",31,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.8351974487304688}"

I've had almost none physical withdrawal symptoms and a few stronger-than-average cravings that I ofc acknowledged but didn't have to really struggle or anything. All the nicotine should've left my body by now, so it seems the physical addiction should be easing up. 

My question, I guess, is this: can it really be this easy? Or is the worst part still somehow coming..? 😂 How to prepare myself for the future? I would've expected the 1st week to be the worst both mentally and physically, and then gradually easing up. My quit has been so easy from the start that it feels surreal to be going back to smoking.

And yet, the majority of posts that I'm reading here or on FB groups are by people who have quit numerous times. This is also backed up by the statistics. In these posts people have stayed quit for 6 months, a year, or 3 years... before picking up smoking again. And then quitting again.

No longer ‘panic’ if I’ve run out of cigs nor stress if I’m running low (cos I don’t smoke). That really is incredible freedom and eventually becomes a norm without considering the previous burden. 

I no longer need to leave situations to get a fix and so I don’t interrupt our family activities which feels  wonderful. I still catch myself thinking I would have left and missed this or that. 

I don’t stink of smoke. With kids and a partner who doesn’t smoke this is a huge deal for us. 

Don’t really have any strong cravings or maybe even cravings, just perhaps fond memories at times which are followed by ‘it’s never gonna happen’ and ‘remember the shit that comes with that’

It wasn’t easy but after the initial weeks it settles down and becomes normalised so I hope this gives people hope who are nearer this stage than 3-5 years. [although the 3-5 year people give me hope :) ]

I was recently talking to someone about quitting smoking and decided to pop back on here to check my number to see how long it has actually been since I quit.  It's been over 4 years!

To anyone quitting now, I am proof that it is possible for anyone!

I quit at age 34 after trying to quit unsuccessfully for about a decade.  Remember that every time you try to quit, whether you succeed or not that attempt, you are closer to quitting.  I do believe that. 

I first quit at age 32 by reading Allen Carr's book ""Easy Way to Quit Smoking"".  

I had heard that if you read this book, you would quit immediately and not suffer through withdrawal.  It sounded like utter bullshit to me!  But, you were allowed smoke while reading it, so I figured I'd try it to prove what bullshit it was. 

I read the book.  It wasn't magic or anything.  It just goes bit by bit and convinces you that you don't need to smoke, and that you are just a drug addict stuck in the ""nicotine trap"".  I smoked the whole time I read it.  I finished it and went to bed.  I woke up the next day and didn't want to smoke. 

I quit for about 8 months.  Then I went to a party where everyone was smoking.  It had been so long and smoking looked so fun, I figured one cigarette wouldn't kill me.  Well, down the slippery slope I went.  Next time with friends, I bummed more cigarettes.  Soon, I was buying packs just for when I was going to be drinking.  Pretty soon after that, I was smoking again. 

Carr's book said that once you quit, all it will take is 1 cigarette to get you going again, and he was absolutely right!  I smoked for another year or so, absolutely furious with myself.  Finally, I decided that enough was enough and I was going to try to quit again.  I remembered everything I had read in the book, and was able to quit cold turkey and never smoke again!

I haven't had a cigarette in over 4 years, and I haven't missed it at all!  I am so thankful and happy that I do not have to smoke anymore.  I will be at parties and events now and try to mindfully think about how much I would have missed before because I was constantly running outside to smoke.  I take deep breaths and enjoy my clear lungs.  I look at the price of cigarettes at convenience stores and smile that I'm not shelling out thousands of dollars on it anymore.  

Not sure if this wall of text will be helpful to anyone, but I hope so.  If anyone is thinking of quitting, I'd recommend the book.  If anyone has already started, keep it up!  You really can do it!",23,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.8995187878608704}"

I wanted to go cold Turkey but I knew it was going to be rough so I bought the step 3 nicoderm patch with the lowest dose of 7mg and figured this will help with the symptoms. It was definitely a lower dose than what my body was used to because I am still experiencing some withdrawal symptoms.

Day 1 - the urge to smoke was really strong, I really wanted a cigarette in the evening but I stuck my patch on and got through it. Definitely felt some restlessness at night.

Day 2 - today I began to feel slight flu-like symptoms like head pressure and body aches, twisting stomach sensation. But the urge to smoke wasn’t as bad. Feeing like crap makes me not want to smoke more. The anxiety is pretty high today too, I feel like I want to go running 5 miles just to help relieve the anxiousness

I've quit nicotine quite a few times on my journey, 2 years has been my best attempt (so far). I've learned from my attempts that it's easier when I avoid other triggers, addictions, habits to gain ""willpower"". I spent the last month quitting weed and caffeine, and the past few weeks I've been going hard with yoga, exercise, breath-work and meditation to ""feel like a new person and disturb my habitual ruts"". 

I know I can do this without fasting, but I'm wondering if that has helped anyone? I could see it adding a bunch of extra stress on top of withdraws, but maybe it would be more beneficial in ways like speeding up withdraw recovery? I couldn't find any scientific literature on the subject (with nicotine anyways) but personally, once I water fast for 3/4 days I begin to feel amazing. The first 3 days of both fasting and nicotine withdraw are probably some of the hardest times I've put myself thru, but today I'm beginning both as sort of an experiment to test my willpower and to see if helps.

I had managed a biblical total of 40 days cigarette free. On the plus side that was the longest I've ever managed and I'm determined I'm not going to revert back to my former identity as a smoker now. 

Severe loneliness and burnout and low mood definitely contributed to cracking. I'm isolated and my ADHD and depression has been kicking my arse lately along with coping with other life stressors...but I think the main cause of caving was the fact that occasional vaping as part of nicotine reduction had crept up as a smoking substitute and I realised that the last few days I was actually consuming way more nicotine than as a smoker but without the unpleasant side effects of smoking and was therefore just swapping an identity as a smoker for one as a vaper when I had started out so strong with NRT. I know a lot of folks here equate vaping with smoking but personally the main thing I needed to mentally overcome was the habit of smoking and the ability to deceive myself that I need to be a smoker. But more importantly to learn to value myself as worth more than poisoning myself with these horrid things.

Damages to your lungs, loss of vocal box, throat cancer and many others smoking related diseases. I have also tried quitting MANY TIMES, going cold turkey before picking up another cig mere hours later. It was a brutal, endless cycle that seems to not helping. Best is 99 days 4 years ago and it was ruined by just ONE puff, which i thought was harmless. I also vape heavily. Low nicotine juice dont work for me, 50mg juices are my favourite and although i try using it as alternatives to cigaratte, it was not helping either. I will vape in the car and the moment i stepped outside, i will smoke 2 cigaratte. I felt vaping made my smoking habit worst. Also i believe, cold turkey doesnt work for me. And i stop giving up smoking. Life is short and everyone will die anyway so who cares? 


Eventually sometime in July last year, i decided to quit again. Not immediately but to do it on the day after my birthday, which was 3 months later back then. Since, i enjoy smoking more. Every cigarette i smoke, i enjoyed it. I appreciated every drag. As the date came closer for me to ‘quit’, i realised smoking is not at all fun. It was a waste of time and money. I wouldnt believe it when i was a smoker but smoking WASTE YOUR TIME. Alot of time! I started to feel excited to quit. 

And on my birthday last year, the day i supposed to quit, i bought 3 packs of cigs. These are my last, so i bought menthol, normal and clove cigarattes. I sat in one bench and smoke away, reminiscing the time about the day i first started to smoke. I smoke 2,3,4 cigarette at a time. Every cig make me sick and i dont actually feel anything. It was not really enjoyable as i have thought. 

Night time comes and i know i should not smoke the next morning. I downloaded Smoke Free app to keep track. Threw all my cig away except one stick (for emergency) I went to bed and slept the night. Next morning, i had zero urges and threw the last stick away and reminded myself that i am now a non smoker and keep doing that and get myself the mindset that smokers are a disgust and bunch of losers because they cant quit but i can do it and lo and behold, it has been one year now and i have zero craving for cigarette!

&#x200B;

Dear quitters of Reddit,

&#x200B;

As someone who quit smoking four years ago today, I want to share my insight and personal experience on what worked for me. I am in no way a professional or a counselor or qualified to give advice, I am just a person who has smoked for twelve years and decided on a Tuesday afternoon in October of 2017 that it was enough. I haven't relapsed once and these days I don't even think about it anymore. Except of course today, because a reminder popped up an told me ""Four years smoke free today"".

&#x200B;

The idea of quitting had been in my mind for a while. Not because my partner wanted me to quit, or because I thought cigarettes were getting too expensive. Not even because I worried that I could develop some nasty health issues when I got older.

&#x200B;

I quit because I wanted to be free of my addiction. And, more specifically: I wanted to be able to sit through an entire movie on Netflix without having to pause for a smoke.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Before**

I would always worry if I had enough cigarettes with me. If the shops were still open. If I could smoke at place X. I used to think in smoke breaks, as I'm sure many of you can relate to. Five minutes before a meeting? Time for a cigarette. Commercials on tv? Smoke time. A short walk to a bus stop? Smoke time. I didn't want to admit it, but smoking cigarettes dominated my entire schedule. It did so sneakily, but it did so nonetheless. If I spent two hours or more in a museum, I wanted to get outside and smoke. I didn't necessarily want to leave, but my addiction was demanding my attention. I couldn't concentrate on the beautiful art before me, I was only thinking ""when can I smoke?""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**During withdrawal**

Did you know that people who quit smoking are often fighting more than one fight? Of course you do. 

&#x200B;

1. You fight the withdrawal symptoms.

2. You fight the desire to smoke. 

3. For some, fighting against overeating as a substitute.

4. You struggle as your brain re-adjusts itself to a life without cigarettes (the habitual part, the part where you don't know what to do with your hands).

&#x200B;

There is a big difference between wanting to quit and being told to quit (either by a person or a situation): I wanted to quit, so I didn't have to fight the desire to smoke. I knew for a fact that I never wanted to light up a cigarette ever again. A switch had flipped in my brain as clearly as if a light turned on in a room.

Now, that did not make the withdrawal symptoms any less bad. The nicotine receptors in my brain were as loud as they always were. The thing that made it easier is that I was able to look beyond the initial withdrawal and focus on the ""after"". Withdrawal doesn't last forever. it's a very real, chemical process in your brain. The nicotine receptors shrink after a while and you won't crave cigarettes anymore. After that, there is a calmer, clearer mind.

&#x200B;

So instead of thinking ""I can't smoke anymore"", I thought ""I've quit smoking. I am experiencing these withdrawal symptoms. I feel like sh\*t but I know this won't last forever. After this is over, I will be free.""

&#x200B;

I would write it down whenever I was wide awake at 3AM, restless, irritated, antsy, grinding my teeth and unable to stay still. In fact, I wrote a lot in the deep dark hours of the night, mostly just describing my feelings or record the time as it passed by. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**After**

First and foremost: I am not a saint. Quitting smoking didn't miraculously heal all my problems and there are many things I struggle with (I got 99 problems but a smoke ain't one). I am not the person who is going to tell you that you will feel amazing and fantastic and reborn. No - you will feel... normal. I feel normal. And it's the best kind of normal I can imagine, because smoking made me feel like a pariah. I can exit any building I have been in for however many minutes and not reach for my cigarettes the moment I walk out. I can make my coffee in the morning and snuggle up on the couch while looking at the downpour and not stand in it, shivering, with coffee in one hand and a cigarette in the other. I don't count in cigarettes anymore. A meeting is now not in one cigarette, but in five minutes. I am no longer constantly thinking about it, being inconvenienced by it, distracted by it, controlled by it. I can spend hours in a museum and be amazed and fully focused on the beauty I see. I can go to the cinema and stay in my seat during the break. I feel normal.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**In conclusion**

I encourage everyone to go and feel super normal. I know everyone's situation is different and I am not here to tell you one method is wrong and the other is right. I just want to shine some light on your motivation to quit smoking. Because if the motivation comes from within you, if you are the one who decides, you can do it. The fight won't be as difficult. And it will 100% be worth it to just not have to think about those stupid cigarettes anymore.

&#x200B;

For me, I chose a time in my life where I felt I wasn't under high stress and things were going relatively well. No exams, no lousy job, I had just moved out on my own, so I had the mental capacity to deal with the emotions. So my advice will be: **quitting is good, but quitting when you're ready is better**.",313,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.7995489239692688}"

It is unhelathy, it is expensive, it makes you stink. Why would anyone want to smoke, at all?

2. It is stressful

When you're a smoker, you always have to worry about having a lighter, lighting up, cigarette butts, ash, emptying ashtrays, buying a pack, having a pack, opening windows during winter when your room stinks, and it's all really - a lot. Once you quit it's all gone.

3. No smoking lifestyle - is a healthy lifestyle

Once you quit smoking, you start to take care of  your body as well. You develop a healthy mindset. For example, I started to take a lot more vitamins than I used to, and drink a lot more teas. You simply choose what's good for you.

4. It's an achievement

If you're a smoker who quit smoking, you feel proud of yourself. Like, I really did that? I managed to quit an addiction? And you just feel better about yourself. It's an huge ego boost, and you start to see yourself as someone who is capable of anything.

5. You're calmer

I was scared to quit smoking before, because I thought ''What if I get even more angry and stressed without cigarettes?'' Well, I was wrong. I feel a lot calmer 3 weeks smoke free, than before. Turns out, it was cigarettes that made me so stressed.",26,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9177758693695068}"

It was really nice to wake up today with free lungs instead of coughing from 20 cigarettes. The evening makes my confident that I can stay „clean“ without the feeling I’m missing something .

I listened to Alan Carr’s audiobook 4 times (on my 5th round now).

2021-10-09 07:02:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/q4j50i/6th_day_without_cigarettes/,6th day without cigarettes!,"Hi everybody, 

I hope you're all doing well. Today marks the 6th day without smoking cigarettes for me. This is the longest I've been in over 1 year and 10 months! I'm 22y old and university student.

This is going to be a long post and I'm sorry in advance.

I'd been a smoker for 2 years but with a ''vacation off cigarettes'' for couple of months where I would smoke one or two here and there but that was it. Throughout my smoking ''career'' I was increasing how much I smoke during the day throughout those 2 years. In the end I would smoke 1 pack and sometimes even 1 and a half or maybe 2 when I was stressed. I realize that 2 years may seem like nothing but believe me, I was a smoker like anyone else with a longer cigarette smoking history behind. My day was built around cancer sticks, they were the first thing for me in the morning and the last thing before going to bed. I would go freezing myself on the balcony in the winter to smoke and I would go in the middle of the night to buy a pack on the machine because tobacco shops didn't work at 12am. This was all just a sign that I was ADDICTED TO A DRUG. Being addicted isn't fun at all. Problem is that some smokers don't even want to accept the fact that they are addicted, they think they like smoking, but that's just a trick their brain is playing on them.

I quit with the help of 25mg Nicorette patch.Without it I would have never quit. I just don't have that strong of a willpower to quit without NRT. I've tired gum and lozenges but I threw up because of the taste and how much I just didn't like them so I decided to get the patches.

The biggest thing I noticed is how much more free time I have now. I can finally dedicate myself to playing video games that I really love and not playing for 1 hour and then craving for a cigarette. I can drink coffee and actually spend time with it, talking to persons around me and not craving for anything. I'll buy a book to read in my free time as well and I'll study more to finish the last couple of exams I have left to graduate.

My biggest motivators to quit were my financial situation, I truly believe that every person should be a better human being to himself/herself and to his family and people who he or she loves. I didn't want my mom and gran to spend money to buy me cigarettes and not have enough for other things... I also wanted to do things I love like gaming and reading and watching things without constantly being bothered for a smoke. I also didn't want to be anxious when I don't have enough cigarettes for the day. And many other things.

I plan to gradually reduce the strenght of the patches within the next few weeks and finally get off them as well. I always take them off before going to sleep and I don't have any issues. During the first few days with the patches I noticed that my skin where the patch is would itch but that would pass within few minutes so not that big of a deal.

I encourage all to quit, using any method you may need or you may find suitable. My psychatrist told me not to quit cold turkey so I didn't and I couldn't have done it that way.

Sorry for the long post, I just wanted to share my story and hold myself accountable. 

P.S. I still think about smoking and romanticize it but I hope I don't cave in. All the best to all!!!",9,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9978519678115845}"

I’ve tried quitting 10+ times : cold turkey, vaping, patches and nicotine candies. The longest I went without smoking were 4 and 7 months, using a vape.

I’m currently 8 months pregnant, down to 6 to 10 cigarettes a day and desperate about ever quitting. I’m in a very poor mental state due to the guilt and worry of smoking while pregnant, and perpetual anxiety because of the stigma, even though you’d guess I’m trying to hide it.

I’ve been actively trying to stop since I got pregnant but with no success. I couldn’t get past 24h so far. I’ve seen a midwife that specializes in addiction and got prescribed patches and candies, but they’re the lowest possible dosage and don’t really bring down the urges beside a psychological effect. I hate the candies too and will switch to gums on my next try.

At this point I kind of gave up on the pregnancy motivator since I’ve been smoking for the past full 7 months... but I can’t stomach that I’ll still be smoking when my baby is born. This is disheartening to me. I don’t give up on trying, but I need to plan my next attempt so that I’m not immediately overwhelmed by the cravings.

I can manage to avoid the cigarettes that I usually smoke “throughout the day”, but some are so deeply rooted in my habits and routines that I’ve the hardest time to fight back. The first cigarette of the morning, that I have with  coffee after breakfast, is a big one. Then the one after lunch. Then the one after dinner.

Then I get the worst cravings in the evening, and especially after I’ve put my son to bed and I’m able to lay back and relax. My husband is a heavy smoker too, and this is usually a time when we sit in the garden and chat and smoke. I easily smoke half a day worth of cigarettes there in one sitting, over a couple hours before going to bed. The association between that moment and smoking is so strong I don’t know how to fight it. This is where all previous attempts have failed.

It's been unusually quiet since only 3 of us stayed in the flat. This level of, let me say, intimacy provides a chance to talk more openly. We also grabbed a beer. These two occurrences are among my worst smoking triggers. Now, I thought I'd be good to go and resistant to cravings. However, at some point of our conversation I found myself saying ""I'm gonna regret it but fuck it, let's grab a cig"". It was met with a stern no from my friends and a bit of asking why I'd need to smoke. While my urge remained, I avoided smoking. 

What's really surprising is the fact that they were actually supportive. Now, I don't really want any support, someone pitying me or whatever, but it felt unusual in a pleasant way. Definitely unlike things I would expect.

 Today I am 28 days smoke free and still going strong!

First 3 days were pretty tough, I had mild tremors and double vision accompanied by somewhat bearable headaches that would come and go throughout the day. Of course agitation was high on the list with my anxiety also being particularly problematic. This was soon followed by excessive mucus down the nasal passage which I did my best to spit out when I was able to but when I wasn't able to, it contributed to congestion and inflammation in the chest, which ultimately felt similar to a chest cold. For that I bought an over the counter bronchodilator syrup which was a great relief and helped get rid of the congestion pretty quickly. A big bowl of chicken soup also helps heaps.

I also experienced very mild palpitations which to be honest I think was just caused by anxiety from having a withdrawal. I also felt like I had alot of nervous energy that I needed to burn so I started walking everywhere instead of driving, randomly doing air cycling on the couch or slapping my feet together like a damn seal...this might puzzle you but I felt the urge to just burn off the nervous energy and sometimes 3 minutes of small movements would help it pass and id forget completely about smoking 


By the end of my first week, I started bloating quite a bit and experienced gastro symptoms, passing larger and more frequent stools. This lasted for the following two weeks and I did make a point of not falling prey to eating more. To help with the stomach issues I started eating cleaner, more veg and probiotics which seemed to settle the stomach issues and the bloating subsided completely after two weeks. 

The purpose of this post is to help others who are either wanting to quit smoking to understand what they COULD experience or those who have recently quit make sense of their symptoms/side effects. We won't all experience the same symptoms/side effects but I think it is worth a shot to share our post quitting experiences because the internet is not always a great help. Anyway today I don't really have physical cravings, I pretend I've never smoked a day in my life and do not entertain any cravings. That seems to help me 

I hope this helps someone, if you are having any questions please ask and I will do my best to assist x

I started to smoke when I was 14-15 years old (currently 29m) and it came a point that I smoked, regularly, 35-40 cigarettes' a day. Yesterday I made the BIG decision: Enough is enough.

In the last 5-6 years I have made a lot of tough decisions and changes (for the better) and I really am a different person: Very confident relatively successful and clear on what I want in life (after many years of suffering from severe anxiety and low self-esteem). Now, It's time for another important step: Letting go of smoking and start focusing on a brighter and healthier future. 

I have already made a mini-plan on how to cope with cravings and how to motivate myself during the tough moments: This community, is part of it! 

I am planning to share my journey with you & hopefully we could all help each other become the best version of ourselves! Thank you so much for reading. Let's do it :)

I don’t know if/when I’ll have another cigarette, but I’m not a smoker. Saying you’re a smoker puts a label on yourself. It’s a self fulfilling prophecy. If you say you are a smoker, then you’ll smoke. If you say you’re not a smoker, then you’re not one. You might smoke again, but you’re not a smoker. 

Don’t label yourself something you don’t want to be. If you give yourself that label, you’ll feel an obligation to fulfill that label.

The 14th day I realised that I dont feel any cravings anymore. Unfortunately I didnt plan to quit at that time so I didnt grab that oportunity and bought a new ones and basically started again. Fucking idiot !

So halfway through the meeting she said something pretty rude to me, which I'm used to and just try to ignore because she's my boss after all. Well instead, today I replied to her: ""EXCUSE ME?!!!""

My heart was pounding. Everyone's jaw dropped. I was panicking. What did I just do?!! Seconds passed. Then she apologized. Twice. And pulled me aside later to apologize some more.

I lucked out here. I wasn't really in control of that situation and it easily could have gone another way. But I have to say I felt like a million bucks hearing her apologize to me over and over.

Things are getting easier. There have been a couple days this week that I've managed to go 4-6 hours without thinking about a smoke instead of fighting a craving every hour. The cravings are weaker and easier to distract myself from. 

I'm still struggling some with sleep. I've been feeling kind of zombie-ish the last week. Tired and bloated and like I've got a bit of a head cold. My anxiety and agitation are both on the intense side but my mood swings are calming down.

Mostly it just feels good though. Every crappy day has still been better than a day spent smoking.

* Not feeling like I have to smoke before I can go anywhere/do anything. I've mentioned this a few times on here but oh my god it's so annoying how everrryyyythingggggg starts being structured around cigarettes. And it makes anything you need to do feel like a massive chore. Even simple stuff. ""Ugh, gotta go CHECK THE MAILBOX. Guess I'll have a cig first. And one after."" Like what??? Just walk thirty feet and grab the mail it's not a hardship that you need cigarettes to get through 😆

* Not having to shower every time I leave the house to avoid smelling too much like smoke. Now I don't smell like smoke because I don't smoke anymore. That's pretty great.

* Not feeling like a loser every time my bonus kid is over and I miss time with them to step out on the porch and get my fix. Or feeling like a loser when they come outside with me to spend time and have to breathe my secondhand smoke. I don't wanna do that to my kid. 

* Looking healthier in general. My teeth already look so much better??? I don't know how that's possible in 2 weeks but they already look brighter. So do my eyes. My skin is a pimply mess right now but I know that'll go away too in a week or so. 

* Feeling healthier in general. Deep breaths come more easily and I haven't noticed my heart racing/pounding as often. My stamina is already starting to improve a bit and I feel less winded during activities. 

I'm sure there are other positives I haven't mentioned, but these are the big ones for me right now. And I know they'll only get better as time goes.",33,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9198685884475708}"

I've been taking steps to quit for a few months now, and it's been going better recently. I was up to smoking about 8-12 cigarettes a day. That may not seem like a lot to some, but it started feeling like a lot to me, which I wonder if body size has anything to do with. (I'm about 120 lbs and 5'4""). The minimum I've been able to get to per day has been about 4 cigarettes, and the maximum number of days I seem to be able to reach without smoking at all has been 2, over the last few months. During the days I am not smoking, I've basically learned to expect having lots of really, really depressed feelings. I don't seem to have any other withdrawal symptoms that I notice, but it's really tough to go through the constant struggle to not have racing thoughts and depression.

I'd love to be able to get on meds for the depression, but I cannot afford them. I think they would help a lot, so it's something I may try to prioritize more. I am also in counseling and quitting smoking has been an ongoing topic with my therapist, but honestly, it hasn't helped. I feel that it only makes me feel more guilty, and it loads on more stress because I feel more pressured to quit for someone else. Not for me.

I think my main problem is that I don't enjoy life in general, so I don't see a way that life would necessarily get better without smoking, only that I wouldn't have to live with the fears and other things that accompany smoking.

I've listened to the recording of Allen Carr's book *Easy Way to Stop Smoking* at least a dozen times now, and although the idea usually sticks for a while - I've ""cracked"" and smoked each time. And it's always a bummer!

Anyway. I read a comment on here once which said something along the lines of ""I'm a nonsmoker now. I don't smoke. I don't want to smoke. **If a meteor were headed for Earth to kill us all, I still wouldn't smoke.**"" And that last line always stuck with me!

I mean - if *a god damn meteor* were about to *kill us all*.... fuck it, right? Smoke up! 

And despite listening to that damn book over and over to make sure I fully understood every point and counter-argument to the shit my brain would come up with to justify smoking... I still never could get over that meteor thing. Because deep down I still believed it was actually an enjoyable experience to smoke and relieve my nicotine withdrawals. Which basically meant I'd never really gotten the point of that damn book lol.

I don't want to smoke. I don't ever want to smoke again. And I'm pretty sure I never wanted to smoke in the first place - except for those first few experimental times. What I want is to *not* want to smoke. Does that make sense? And for most of my life, the only way to get rid of that craving/urge to smoke was to just smoke. Yet the sick joke is that smoking is what perpetuates the eternal hell of always wanting to smoke. 

I don't want to smoke. I want to not want to smoke, and I do that by not smoking. Every time I think I want a cigarette - I realize ""no. I don't want a cigarette, I am having a trigger/craving/urge to do what I've always done. But that has not worked, and it will not ever work. I want to be free of this hellish nightmare of suffering feelings of withdrawal followed by feeling guilty for caving in."" And I do that by not smoking. And every day the nicotine leaves my body a bit more, and every day I train myself to react to triggers by not wanting to pursue that damned strategy I fooled myself into relying on.

And to that end - it's a relief to realize that as long as I've got my head screwed on right, I won't ever fall for the trick again. Not tomorrow and not next year, because if I plan on smoking again one day - to throw out all logic and self-preservation for a phantom of relief - then I might as well do it this very moment. Logical fallacies have a way of immediately collapsing the entire framework like that. I get it now. I don't want to smoke. I never want to smoke. Gun to my head, meteor headed right for the Earth, that sucks... but suggesting I smoke a cigarette is just as dumb of an idea as suggesting I shoot up heroin or bash my toe with hammer.",101,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.998618483543396}"

My work had a lot of down time so almost everyone in the warehouse would sit around chain smoking. They would smoke in the trucks and at our delivery sites. Eventually it became too tempting and to relieve stress from work and school I began smoking as well.

At first it was just cigarillos. I would smoke one in the morning before class. They used to sell flavored cigarillos which made it easier to get into. Then one day I ran out, so I bummed a smoke from someone on campus. I realized they weren't as bad I thought they would be, and they were cheaper, so I started buying those instead.

Then it turned into a social thing. Hanging out with the other guys between class at the smoke pit and shooting the shit. Smoking in a circle in the warehouse with the other guys at work before our next delivery. Some of my other friends had started smoking as well so I would smoke a lot at parties. One cigarillo in the morning turned into about 8-12 smokes a day.

I still lived at home and had to hide it from my parents. I'm not sure how they couldn't smell it when I came home but I managed to hide it. One time they found an empty pack in my car and called me out on it. I said I had smoked some but had quit already, which was a lie. Then I kept smoking in secret. I knew it was an addiction.

Eventually the guys in my class started switching to vapes. This was in the somewhat early days of vaping around 2015. I picked up a cheap vape and found it was actually pretty easy to switch from cigarettes to the vape. The vape tasted better and at the time juice was pretty cheap. It was easier to hide and I could vape inside (I never smoked inside or in my car).

The cheap vape turned into sub-ohm mods, DIY coil wrapping, and bigger and bigger bottles of juice. It got more and more expensive. I didn't do the math but it might have been more expensive than smoking. Occasionally I would go back to smokes when I ran out of juice, but could switch back to the vape pretty easily.

It came to a point where I knew I couldn't keep vaping. But quitting vaping was incredibly hard. I tried and failed a dozen times. Vaping was too easy and too convenient and I couldn't resist it.

I made a promise 2 years ago that I would stop vaping. I failed, but kept it a secret. I hid it from the person I promised it to. The second time I lied and hid my addiction from someone close to me. I feel an immense amount of guilt for hiding it for so long.

My last vape was 2 weeks ago, and while I have constant cravings I've resisted so far. I'm doing NRT right now and it's helping.

It feels weird to say, but I miss standing out in the rain having a lonely smoke. I hope that feeling goes away eventually.

I can't share my 2 weeks of progress with anyone else since I supposedly ""quit"" 2 years ago. So I'm posting it here to get it off my chest. Thanks for reading.",13,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9984329342842102}"

Sometimes we did sometimes we didn’t. For the past almost 2 years I’ve had monthly anxiety attacks that are crippling and just downright horrible. The process: I’d have a moment where I’d get this weird nervous aura followed by anxiety, a hot flash, shaking, sweats, and general confusion about my current situation. Everything would stop in under a minute, except the shaking and anxiety. The shaking would slow itself down after a while, but the crippling anxiety would last 3-4 days.

For a year and a half I thought I was having issues with depression and the fear of having another attack was almost just as bad. It happened every month almost to the day with a few times it skipping a month or being slightly later in the month but it was still consistent.

After multiple changes of diet and other daily routines and having no luck it finally hit me. I was mixing in way too much tobacco and having it way too often, and when I was having my attacks it was when I wasn’t having any tobacco at all. Basically withdrawal effects from not using.

Also i need to safe money and i really really wanna get rid of the anxiety ciggarettes come with

&#x200B;

Been on the fence about quitting for a while. All the mental, physical and economical benefits of not smoking aside, there's something soothing about smoking that really calms me and I guess I'm a little afraid of letting that go.

Been smoking for about 25 years and I really don't want to quit, but I decided that with the way the world is going, there's less and less space for smokers in it. Imagine being on holiday somewhere nice. You find a great looking cozy bar and they serve you a delicious cold beer, the sun is out and everything is perfect. You ask for an ashtray and are told that it's a non-smoking facility and you need to go behind that building on the other side of the street (without your drink) to have a cigarette.

One of my reasons for wanting to quit this habit is to avoid the imagined scenario above. I remember when they banned indoor smoking in clubs/restaurants many years ago. I was furious at the time, but it only took a little while until it became the accepted norm. And now, even as a smoker, I would not like to see indoor smoking making a return.

I decided to seek medical help to make the process easier on me. My doctor prescribed Champix, which is a 4-week treatment. I'm now on day 6, and much to my big surprise, it took over two hours this morning (even after a couple of cups of coffee) before I realized that I'd ""forgotten"" to smoke. The cravings simply weren't there as they use to be. It is advised to continue to smoke while taking the pills for the first half, as eventually smoking will induce nausea which will hopefully help with the psychological addiction.

Why am I writing all of this? No idea. Guess I'm just trying to put some thoughts down somewhere and this felt like an appropriate place to do so.",8,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9774051308631897}"

I used to have really bad insomnia. Like, some nights I just wouldn't be able to fall asleep for hours. There were times I actually had to call out of work because it wasn't safe for me to drive on 2-3 hours of sleep. I experienced insomnia at least once a week, sometimes more. The doctor wouldn't prescribe sleeping medication and recommended I take melatonin or benadryl before bed; both of which did next to nothing for me. So I was just kind of SOL for a long time.

Cravings stayed at 7-8 out of 10 for 6 months. Straight up. It finally got a little easier this summer. COVID helped since I’ve basically stopped going to bars which is where I did a lot of smoking, but don’t get me wrong, I had plenty of cravings at home alone too. 

I was heavily dependent on throat lozenges for the first six months also.  (menthol — the stronger the better. I needed something that burned). I was going through the 200ct family pack of Halls Sugar Free menthol a week. I still like one every now and then. But it’s more like one a day max, and usually just before bed. 

My grandma died last month. We were very closed….she practically raised me. The temptation to light up was there. It was hard not to relapse. But even still, that craving was at about a 5-6 compared to what it was like during early 2021. So it does get better. But, I wouldn’t say ids “easy” yet. Because I still have to be vigilant. Not trying to discourage you just want you to be realistic.

In the time since I quit. I've smoked the equivalent of about 3 cigs

Usually the next day or two I feel I might be slightly more irritated but I didn't fully cave.

Well, last weekend, my neighbor was randomly talking to me and invited me over for a couple beers. 3 in, he lights up a cig.. I was a piece of crap and asked for one and smoked it, bit drunk but no excuse.

Basically, I'm not completely powerless when I'm around an opportunity (definitely had like 5 + times where people were smoking and I did not try to ask for a cig.) But these fleeting moments where my mind says fuck it let's have half a cig or whatever on the weekend are definitely my biggest struggle rn.

So 40 days in! not gunna lie i HAVE had a hard time with this and continue to. But im still glad Im doing it..I'm realizing cigarettes were a hugely toxic thing covering up issues i SERIOUSLY need to face in my life. Unaddressed depression/adhd. Holy freakin smokes. My mental health has gone buckwild since quitting. But i know i have to press on. I'm currently working on seeing if im deficient vitamin/mineral-wise in anything...messing around with diet to see if theres any foods that might be contributing to the depression and acne breakouts. Started praying to check and see if God exists and if i could rely on such a one instead of earthly dopamine sources. Idk. I'm just shaking things up. Quitting smoking. When the fog cleared i could better see what needs work in my life. And the worry and guilt about smoking so much, about spending so much; feels really good to have that be gone. To be doing something i actually am proud of, flipping a bird to big tobacco. Finally. I remember all my tears in the beginning of this quit. Wanting so badly to be free while i sucked down cigarette after cigarette and could not stop. Fight me on this if you want but I do believe it is much harder to quit if you are depressed or adhd. Somehow that nicotine/dope hit is 3000001x more precious to you bc you were already starting from a place of lack of ""feel ok in life"" chemicals.  But it can be done. And i frickin SEE YOU trying to quit. And I see the magnitude of the battle you're in. Keep going.

That might seem off-putting to some, but I manage my use extremely well and believe drugs enhance my life. I use drugs proactively and with purpose, rather than reactively. I have never had a dependence on any drug, nor engaged in a use pattern one might consider abusive. Well, except for nicotine.

I was previously a heavy vaper for about two years, then I took Tabex which reduced, but didn't eliminate my use.  The past year or so my nicotine habits have been ""social"" or intermittent. Typically I'll buy a disposable vape on a Friday and kill it over the weekend.  Sometimes I'll indulge when I'm stressed like during exams season. 

My current dilemma is that some of my favorite other drugs, Adderall, alcohol, and Modafinil, trigger cravings. I haven't had nicotine in 2 weeks and took an Adderall this morning to get some work done; all I can do is think about walking down to the smoke shop and buying a vape. Alcohol is similar, typically I drink 2x/week; heavy (4-7 drinks) on Friday and moderate (2-3) on Saturday. I crave nicotine intensely when I'm drunk.

Now the obvious solution here is ""stop drinking"" and ""stop taking stimulants"" but as an introverted college student I have to be honest, I'm not willing to give up drinking.

Although in the past I wanted to quit smoking, there was also a part of me that still wanted to smoke. This time I want to quit smoking AND I also don't want to smoke anymore. As in I wouldn't smoke even if someone paid me to smoke. Let's say even if the cigarette companies turned around and gave me all my money back to start again, I'd decline, middle finger up.  For the first time I can see that smoking is, in a word, stupid and in another word, it stinks. And to further my point a little farther, as someone wrote here, a slow suicide. That's 3 very big S's-stupid, stinks, suicide.

I'm using patches, originally 25mg (that was way too high tbh, so I've just gone down to 21mg, expecting to feel slightly off for the next few days)

Proud of myself because I knew cold turkey was too scary for me, I have tried a few times but usually relapsed at 3 weeks due to depression, but I still haven't put a cigarette in my mouth for a whole month (apart from one slip, which I don't count as a relapse cos I didn't feel the need to continue, I just continued putting the patches on the following days), the patch helps a lot and I've had very little cravings, even hanging around other smokers (defo need to shake up my social circle tho, so I am around less people who could trigger me as I ween off patches too)

I'm going to start lowering my patch strength come halloween, so the end of this month, I'll go 14mg for 2 weeks and then 7mg for 2 weeks, I'm expecting it to be tough but I've been using this month to break the lifestyle addiction and learn as much about quitting as I can and strengthening my resolve.

I haven't been a smoker for long, only about a year and a half, so I know I should quit sooner rather than later as I'm just making it harder for future me, and I don't see a future for myself where I continue smoking, my lungs were already feeling it and I struggled to run 1km, where I was previously a super sporty person.

I think what has helped my recovery is I'm not *just* quitting smoking, I'm building up my whole life, replacing bad habits with good ones etc, finding things to look forward to, making huge changes... eg I started a new job, been going to the gym for zumba classes, yoga.. I started brazillian jiu jitsu, I'm looking at other hobbies and classes to try and theres a board game club I'll be going to on saturdays, I have spent a lot of time thinking about my future and what I want and I even have a mild career path/direction, and once I'm at my next job in a few months (in warehouse right now, plan to move to office work), I'll have my evenings free and more stuff to do, cos that's what I need, I smoked cos I was depressed cos my life sucked, so I'm making my life a good one.

Anyway, this is turning into a ramble, just wanted to join the conversation and share my own thoughts and experiences so far.

Thanks to the cost in Ireland, £14.30/Pack of 20.  I started saving those money in a separate e-wallet and on completing 200 days I will gift myself something special.  I am loving the cumulative. 

How I feel now?

\-- There is a change in my breathing. I stopped taking a deep breath with open mouth after an interval. 

\-- I snore less now.

\--I no more hate sweetness in food. 

\--I don't feel tired whole day and also yawn less and don't fear for aerobic activities. 

\--Drinking alcohol without smoking was no fun for me. So, my drinking habit made a sharp decline just like the economy after the covid lockdown, and during this period I drank around 5-6 times which was earlier 3-4 times a week. 

\--I learned the relation between pressure with smoke. Now, I don't take unnecessary pressure just to find an excuse to smoke. 

\--My digestion is also getting better after the decrease of alcohol and smoking combo. 

\--I get more time for myself. Take this as an eg. I am sharing this on a Sunday morning at 9am. Previously, Sunday morning was reserved for a hangover.

I think I just want company tbh, maybe a well done, sad I know but I feel like nobody's bothered or jealous of me really, smokers in work tend to look the other way when I tell them. Probably envious. I dont know, im super hungry, super bored and restless, i should be alseep right now.
Worth noting in my joints I had 3/4 of a cigarette in each joint so I was getting pretty high doses kf straight tobacco though the roach, smoked 6+ joints a day, so I dont know why it has seemed oretty easy to get off the nicotine. I thank Allan tbh.",15,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9943742752075195}"

Had one last week, then one 2 days ago…I quit right after the last one. I’m under a lot of health stress and have been sitting with the cravings and some body pain. 

Quitting is so hard, but I focus on imagining the cigarette-free life I was building: 

I don’t want whoever eventually dates me to have to contend with mood swings, the funky smell. 

I’ll be better with emotional regulation in general. 

I’m a better driver when I’m not jonesing. 
My teeth will my lighter and my lips brighter. 

I’ll be a better example for my sister than my mom is. 

It’d be so easy to drown my problems in some smoke right now. If I smoke, I’ll have the same problems. At least now having to quit again won’t be one of them. 

Even as I’m typing this, I want to go buy a pack… I’ll blow bubbles and chew gum instead.

How do you guys deal with stress?

Unfortunately, I don't mean day to day, ""normal"" stressors, like work and bills and arguments with the SO. I have a special needs teen, elderly parents with severe health issues, a vindictive ex who won't stay out of my life, and zero support (for the day to day as well as quitting). I don't get a break from the BS flying at me, and on any given day it's all I can do to not start screaming, even without trying to quit. It seems like every time I try, or even just plan to quit, it amps up significantly. This go round, in the weeks leading up to my planned quit day my landlord informed me that he's renovating and I have to move by the end of the month, my father has fallen ill, my daughter is having daily meltdowns (she has ASD), the ex abruptly stopped paying support, the car broke down, and my cat needs surgery. Yep.

Quit day was today, and I went for I regardless. It went well for almost two hours, but probably because I was up hours before anyone else, and had quiet. Once the kiddo was up and the parents were calling, I found myself in the RoFo parking lot with a full pack in hand and hating myself.

Things are not going to change anytime soon, so I have to find a way to handle it, but I'm at a loss. I've tried breathing exercises, meditation, exercise, going for walks, etc, and it only helps as long as I'm able to continue actively doing it. I have to work, so it's not as if I can just spend all day trying to destress. Due to allergies, NRT and meds are not options for me, nor is any kind of medication for stress (yay). Logically, I understand that it's a matter of willpower, but too often I'm just crumbling under the pressure, and I don't know how to steely up against it.",8,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9986457228660583}"

So I am kind of desperate. I want to quit smoking more than anything but every time the craving hits, I forget all the reasons I wanted to quit before and all I can think about is: « I want to smoke », and before I know it I went to buy another pack and I am smoking, and I am back at square one, feeling disappointment, sadness, despair and disgust …
