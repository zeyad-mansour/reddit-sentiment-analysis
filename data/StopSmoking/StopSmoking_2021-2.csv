I am a male in my late 30s. I usually smoked 1 pack a day and finally quit by tapering it off.

My question to ex-smokers is...how long does it take for mouth to return to a pre smoking state? What I'm referring to is all the inflammation, yellowing of the teeth, skin, any ulcers etc?

I heard it was common to have ulcers after quitting, but I'm just talking about in general the entire mouth tissue...is it 2-8 weeks? I've seen that  thrown out there.

There seems to be a lot of focus on the lungs and other parts of the body after quitting smoking but honestly the mouth gets hit pretty hard since it's the first thing to take all the smoke.

I know a year is a very low number relative to how long many people smoke, but I still worry about the risk of getting cancer, etc...maybe I read too much online.

So when the urge happens, in your mind think the thought, "" I need to quit smoking.""

but hold it for as long as the next exhale you experience.. should be about 3 to 5 seconds....

EXAMPLE

URGE  + QUICK SMOKING THOUGHT DRAWN OUT ( ex. I NEEEEEEEEEEEEED TOOOO  QUIIIIIIT SMOOOOKING ) UNTIL THE FULL EXHALE OF YOUR CURRENT BREATH IS  DONE

TRY IT PLEASE!

IF THINGS GET REALLLLLYYY complicated take this idea:

Make yourself a sandwich and some chips.

Put them on a plate.

Now move your face closer to your food and pretend you are in FOOD LAND!

Shift the Doritos mountains as if they were held up by tectonic plates.

And carry out your thought holding throughout the full exhale

ALSO  mornings seems to be worse than any other time, sit up on the side of  your bed (or lie down whatever is best for you), back erect hands in  your lap feet flat and do the thought holding exercise on exhale. You  may have to do it a few times to get the blood flowing correctly again.  If you run into trouble keeping track of when to hold the thought for  the full exhale, feel free to cross your arms over your chest. This will  make it easier to visualize the exhale.

You  get the best benefit when you hold the thought for the complete  exhale.. when you get to the smoking part of the ""i need to quit  smoking"" you will get the best benefit if you hold the last g until you  feel its time to inhale again. Also, if it pangs the mind of toughness,  prepend the thought of intention with either of the 3 body postures  (depending on which one you are in):

sitting, standing, laying down

EXAMPLE:

On  exhale, raise the thought ""I NEED TO QUIT SMOKINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG (  held just right when compared to the exhale, not to short, not to long  \*basically not our traditional smokers breath but not head rushing long  or non-impactful short\* the mind will often drift to ego thoughts, just  see how fast you can bring the intention back to the thought of needing  to quit. it MUST be one continuous thought within the exhale...

edit\* actually a tidbit of head rushing may show benefits

to  add to the description:You will feel the unfamiliarity in the stomach  when the time is right to release the breath and take in yourself and  your new feelings.

No  scientist here, but this method also may decrease the risk of stroke in  smokers if done properly. Feel free to MSG me if need be and I could further explain any details not fully understood.

I really want to quit smoking. I am very unhappy at the moment because I am more or less completely isolated. I am single, living alone in a big city and if it were not for working (which takes place at home due to Covid) I wouldn't have any reason to get up or do anything.

I feel shame because I smoke, I dislike the smell. However I am spending almost all my free time with youtube and smoking.

I feel that smoking makes my situation even worse because it keeps me in this passivity and when I go out I feel bad because I think other people will smell the cigarettes on my clothes, in my hair, etc.

Yet, it is so difficult to keep the decision. I have tried several times but I don't even manage to get through one day because if I am honest, then I am not even trying to resist the urge.

I hope you are all having a good weekend. Today marks 7 days without smoking for me. The first two days and nights were the hardest. I share a house with my brother who is a smoker. So I have been going out for lots of walks. I have put a chinup bar up in the house and I have been doing pressups and/or pull-ups every time the urge to smoke hits me.

I smoked from the age of 14 and I'm 35 now. In recent times I was smoking 20 a day. 

My main reason for posting here is to share a few things I've noticed. I am obviously breathing more clearly. I took a few selfies the day before stopping and there is a noticeable improvement in my complexion and skin colour. With my brother still smoking it's been interesting to note certain things... I can't believe how noticeable the smell is even over his fragrance and deodorant. I regret going around smelling of smoke so much. It's hard to imagine how non smokers put up with me.

I think I'll keep going. I'd feel pretty silly if I smoked a cigarette now after making it through 7 days. Lockdown has meant the pubs are closed. I'm banned from my local anyway, but it is easier to avoid social settings where I would normally be drinking and smoking with friends.

I hope this ramble inspires someone to give up or stay the course if you've already stopped.

It's a total fallacy what we firmly believe as nicotine users.

 I just enjoyed drinks the other night without having to use nicotine and couldn't believe that is was just as enjoyable as a non nicotine user. We have these false associations with nicotine that are kept alive by continuing to use this DRUG and falling for the idea that we'll never enjoy life without it. It's crazy how nicotine changes our thoughts and makes us believe such silly ideas like I'll never enjoy this and that if I'm not using nicotine. 

Alan Carr was right, we don't ENJOY smoking, we only ENJOY relieving the withdrawals of nicotine because if we weren't addicted to nicotine, there wouldn't be a VOID to fill if we weren't addicted to nicotine.

Wish my luck, please","My Smoke Free app recommended I reach out to other people quitting, so I figured I would weigh in with my two cents for those who have or will find themselves in a similar mindset.

I‚Äôve been smoking essentially for 12 years (since I turned 18.) In my early 20‚Äôs I felt invincible, so I never cared to quit until I met my first wife. Quit cold turkey with her, that lasted about two years. Then the divorce came, and I went right back to smoking to cope with the stress

Since then I‚Äôve tried to quit about a thousand times. I‚Äôve tried cold turkey, nicotine gum, a half dozen quit smoking apps, everything, but nothing could keep me going. For a while I went back and forth between cigs and vapes, but I found that vaping was even more addicting and detrimental for me. In the past few years I‚Äôve noticed the impact smoking has had on my breathing and my health, but always get drawn back in either by peer pressure or the pains of withdrawals

Finally, last weekend, I ran out of cigarettes and something in me decided that that would be my time to quit. Thinking about it, I couldn‚Äôt tell you what was different about that moment from the thousand times before that I‚Äôve run out of smokes. But it was. And just like every other time, withdrawals was a bitch.

The first day was surprisingly uplifting. I felt a surge of motivation and moved like a machine cleaning up my house and taking care of chores and tasks I had put off for too long. I didn‚Äôt notice any cravings. The second day, I could feel withdrawals really kick in. After a thousand quit attempts I have learned to recognize what feeling are attributable towards withdrawals. I felt easily irritated and depressed, and my mind started to creep up with little excuses for why I should give in.

The third day was the worst. I just felt really down. I started feeling disappointed with my life, telling myself without nicotine I had nothing to look forward to. I solved that conundrum by playing with my daughter. 

So far, my main coping mechanism has been to keep busy and drink water. Don‚Äôt sit still for too long. If I sit for too long (like right now as I write this) the urge to smoke starts to creep in. If I‚Äôm in the middle of a large task and I feel the urge, I walk to my water jug 200 ft away and drink. The switch in gears is just as crucial as the act of drinking water itself. 

The cravings are not too intense anymore(mostly because I am quick in quashing them before they get out of control), but the feeling like I‚Äôm missing something is still there. Still on my first week, so I‚Äôm hoping things will only get better from here.",8,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.6658933162689209}"

Things have been god awful at work recently and I‚Äôve just been feeling all around pretty low. I needed something, and had started to miss it. But when I got to the gas station and asked for the smokes I went to pay with cash which was in my pocket. The cashier informed me they weren‚Äôt taking cash at the moment, only cards.

I started smoking when I was 14 years old and smoked a pack a day without thinking much about until I turned 29. While most of the times I didn't pay much attention to my smoking habit at all, somewhere during last year I started having these awful/beautiful moments, I would stare at the cigarrette pack on my nightbed and just feel scared of the power this habit had over me. In countless ocations I promised myself that I wouldn't buy any other pack tomorrow, enjoyed my ""last"" cigarrete, only to fail as soon as I got out work the next day.
One day between October and November of 2020 I stopped cood turkey after a crazy night out, I must have smoked like 2 packs that night drinking and partying with my friends. 
To be honest I had a couple of missteps along the way and smoked a cigarrete in more than one ocation (3) but im still going strong and this my most successfull attempt at quiting so far. I have stayed off cigarretes for a while but they are still present in my mind a lot of the time.

Gum (which is much cheaper) is in no way relaxing for me, I like it pretty much only if I'm on my bike, driving or at the gym any other time it's lozenges.

I'm using 1mg lozenges and thinking back I used to make my own ejuice with 100mg/ml PG nic base. 1ML of that should make 100 1mg candies right?

Or doing a search I saw someone else with an idea to drop nic base on already made candy like altoids, but doing that I'd need a weaker nic base since I can't measure .01ml to drop on each mint, if I used 12mg/ml base one drop should get me around 1.2mg per candy but would a fat drop of PG sufficiently evap/go away? I don't think it would and I saw someone there suggest an alcohol nic base which would evaporate pretty quickly. Just wanting to check and see if anyone here has done anything like this.

I am decent to advanced at cooking but have never done anything close to candy-making before and I'm thinking buying cheap mints from the store that I can dope is the more sustainable idea for me but if that will require alcohol nic base which may be hard to get then maybe I want to learn how to make hard candy with .01ml pg in it.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9980518817901611}"

You really don't realize how much your life revolves around smoking until you don't do it anymore... or at least I didn't. I spent so much time smoking or thinking about when I could go smoke.

I do the Smoke Free app and the number that always amazes me isn't the life regained or the money saved - it's the time I've saved! Assuming that a cig takes 5 minutes to smoke, I've accumulated 28.3 DAYS worth of time spent not smoking in 1.5 years. That's just insane to me.

I always said I would quit when I was 30 but I don't think I ever really believed I would. I really enjoyed smoking but when my dad was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer at 60, I knew I had to or I'd end up where he unfortunately was. The beginning was HARD, even with patches. After graduating from patches, it was still difficult. The hardest part for me was managing stress without that crutch. Tedious tasks were awful for several months. But it was so worth it! Every time I see someone smoking, I'm like I can't believe I used to do that for 9 years.

It's been just over a year since I lost my dad, and I had some mess ups around the time he passed but I didn't let those turn into buying a pack and falling back into a habit. I just accepted that I had smoked a cigarette and moved on as if it hadn't happened. I was offered one on New Year's Eve, that was my brand and everything, and the thought of actually smoking it was revolting and made me nauseous which then made me really happy. Felt like a milestone. Anyway - just wanted to share and tell people to always keep moving forward in your quit, even if you stumble back a couple times, just pick yourself up and keep going!

Here's my reflection on the last year!,"After smoking for over 15 years, I smoked my last cigarette one year ago today. I smoked my first at age 14- a child, like most of us did. After multiple attempts to quit I was finally fed up. I was sick of spending my hard earned money on $9+ packs of smokes. I was tired of smelling like smoke and hiding it from my coworkers and friends. I hated knowing the damage I was doing to my body. I hated being controlled by cigarettes. 

I ordered and read ""Easy Way""..... twice lol. I frequented this sub and read stories of hope and dispair. I downloaded the Smoke Free app and coughed up the $5 for the premium version. I kept reminding myself of all of the reasons I really really hated smoking. 

I was almost always a half a pack a day smoker, but the final year I smoked an entire pack most days. I chose not to cut down prior to my quit because I realized depriving myself would only make me want that next cigarette even more. So I smoked and smoked until I was grossed out. I paid special attention to how the ""good cigarettes"" that I would fiend for were very rare. I also chose to not use NRT... I just wanted to cut myself off cold turkey and rid myself of nicotine once and for all. 

Quitting smoking sucks. I mean, its different for everyone but for me, it really really sucked. I didn't have what I would call cravings, but a incessant obsession with cigarettes. I thought about them non stop. A few days into my quit I began to sink into a horrible depression, accompanied by insomnia. Of course I wanted to stop the suffering by buying another pack, but my previous failures really kept me going. I would vividly remember my prior relapses and how ashamed I was and how, honestly, the relapse smoke wasn't nearly as ""good"" as I had envisioned it to be. One of my relapses led to EIGHT more years of smoking!!!! Ugh! 

I went out and bought a bunch of delicious food and allowed myself to consume without restrictions as long as I didn't smoke. Takeout, soda, icecream, candy, cookies, etc... it REALLY helped. I binged on Netflix and slacked on my house chores. I splurged on fancy bath soaps and treated myself to luxurious baths. But most of the first month was gritting my teeth and staying busy so I could put another day clean under my belt.

After the first month I was feeling really proud. The ""cravings"" had improved a lot and it felt so good to have such a significant amount of smoke free time behind me. One thing I didn't expect was that I would continue to have ups and downs. If I remember right, I had some really challenging moments at month 3, 4, and 6. Even now, at 1 year clean, we've had a couple sunny spring like days and I've thought ""Damn a cigarette would be nice."" But the difference now is that my mind is no longer completely controlled by the nicotine and I can clearly rationalize that one smoke on a crisp spring day comes with a lifetime of smoking. I still have dreams. Oh, so many smoking dreams over this last year! In the beginning, they were mostly me lighting a smoke then realizing ""Oh shit I just relapsed!"" Now the dreams are of me smoking, but somehow in these dreams I'm just an ""occasional smoker."" Its weird. 

One year in I can say that my brain still hasn't completely rewired itself but I have come so far. A lot of this experienced sucked but I am so happy to now identify as a nonsmoker and I never want to go back. I can breathe, go on walks and hikes without getting short of breath, I smell good, I am no longer ashamed, I've saved $2000 according to the Smoke Free app, I have reduced my risk of heart and lung disease, life is good. And most importantly I realized I do not need cigarettes to enjoy my life. 

Its true that the best time to quit is RIGHT NOW. Do not get discouraged. It takes time to build the motivation to start a quit. Know that it wont be pleasant and you may have ups and downs and you will probably have multiple attempts. It's a learning process. I personally think cold turkey is probably the best method but I also think that you should do WHATEVER you can to avoid ever smoking again, whether that means gums, patches, or pills- if it gets you there, that is what is important. Most of all, never lose hope!!",32,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.99458909034729}"

I now haven't smoked in a little while and think that I could keep it up (or at the very least, not buy any nicotine for myself and just smoke w others, which I would be perfectly happy with)---- but I don't really get why I should avoid nicotine at all?

I've never bought more than a pack in a week and I don't see myself breaking that limit, and I do want/enjoy smoking. I get that I only enjoy it because I am addicted. But I still enjoy it. I get that I can get all of the 'benefits' of smoking without smoking if I were to quit completely - but that really doesn't seem to matter to me? I like the idea of feeling eh and feeling good with a cigarette much more than the idea of feeling 'good' all the time and not having any point of reference to compare it to.

&#x200B;

I have seen people on this sub (I don't browse here normally but today I felt like looking incase there was any insight that might resonate with me) mention that they quit when they ""knew they didn't want to smoke anymore"" and that sounds perfect and great - and if I ""knew I didn't want to smoke"" or ""knew I didn't enjoy smoking"", I would totally quit. I feel confident in my ability to (and I'm sure every smoker-in-denial does as well lmao, but I am quite good w habits as of recently so I do have faith). BUT - I just don't want to quit. I am posting on this sub, so maybe that means something subliminally - and I get that I guess I should(?) quit? but I'm not that attached to my longevity (if it's even affected), I live quite healthily otherwise (I have a nutrionally complete diet, work out every day, meditate, etc, and am on my way to med school).

&#x200B;

I am quite confused about handling this whole feeling of 'I guess I should quit' versus 'I do not want to quit at all.' Maybe I'm posting here to assure myself that there's no one with a good enough reason to convince me to want to quit, so that I can smoke comfortably and not doubt my decision. Maybe I unconsciously want to quit and hope someone here will give me a good enough reason. I don't know if 'a good enough reason' would even convince me, or if it exists. I would like to live the rest of my life smoking at the same rate that I do, including the breaks that I take every once in a while, without wondering if I am making the wrong decision.

Currently my stance is: ""I do not want to quit; I enjoy smoking, though I realize that it has a detrimental effect on my health overall, and that the only 'benefits' I get from smoking result from my baseline quality of life being lowered and smoking compensating for that. They still feel like 'benefits' to me, though. I guess if I had a good reason to quit, I might.""

Thoughts? I am planning on getting a pack of cigarettes tonight so I probably won't make any attempt to quit until after a lil trip I'm going on for a week, but I would very much like to be certain (one way or another) in my smoking soon.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.7134504318237305}"

I would like to thanks all the people that completed it until the end. Most of you didn't reach the end of the survey and I can unfortunately not use your response in my final analysis... By the way, you should be able to resume the survey if you didn't clear the cache memory of your browser.

I feel that my call for respondents is starting to run out of steam, but I really need more respondents to be able to carry out a proper scientific study.

This will be one of the last calls to the community to ask you to take 10 short minutes of your time to complete this survey. These are really not complicated questions, you can even fill it out while watching your favorite TV show. 

Please help me in my research and as promised I will put all my efforts to build a helpful digital tool for the r/StopSmoking community. A tool that could help you in your process of quitting but also in keeping in touch with other redditors living same struggles, difficulties but also achievement than you.

I paired the patches with gum on friday and have been completely smoke free since then. I feel okay. My mouth is a bit dry from the gum but my chest feels better. I had a flash of pain in my ribs earlier, not sure if that was caused by my lungs cleaning themselves?

Unfortunately life is super stressful for me right now, i recently lost my job and that, combined with Covid has really created a hard environment for me to stop. I know it's all excuses, and I will put all of my reasoning and strength into not falling back into that trap. I dunno, I just felt like writing this to be accountable, and appreciate any kind words/harsh truths and support that I can get. Good luck to all of you, smoking yourself into an early grave for literally nothing isn't worth it. I feel so much fitter, I jog every other day and can breath really well all things considered.  


Much love to all of you and I wish you all the strength and resilience in the world

Maybe I should take a lozenge before family time? Perhaps that would just prolong my withdrawal. I figure less is more. I can take physical symptoms no problem, but if the mental side gets too bad I know I have them as a backup.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9976294636726379}"

You took advantage of my youthful naivety and seduced me into an abusive relationship. You were always there because you wanted to control me, you wanted to make sure I was never far from your grasp. You played mind games whenever you didn't get the attention you wanted. Most of my friends and family can't stand to even be around me when I'm with you. You cost me so much money, but never once have you contributed anything financially. Even my physical health has suffered because I'm always so focused on you instead of taking care of myself.

I got so stressed that I ended up picking it up again. And I am right where I left off. Every time I smoke, I come inside and change my clothes, and wash my hands so I don‚Äôt effect the baby. I don‚Äôt breast feed so she won‚Äôt get it that way either. 

My partner wants me to quit, I want me to quit, most of my family doesn‚Äôt know I started again but they would want me to quit. I don‚Äôt want this around my baby.

Recently I‚Äôve been experiencing vertigo something bad. I‚Äôm worried about being able to care for my baby, and I‚Äôm starting to wonder if the cigarettes are reacting to my meds.

&#x200B;

So I quit smoking cigs for a decent amount of time last year. What I noticed then was that when I stopped I had tremendous pains in the body. Heart, shoulder, lungs, sweats, no sleep, ,impossible to concentrate. Felt like was having a heart attack at certain points of the day. I persevered and exercised every day and after a few weeks I actually felt great and the symptoms went away....

&#x200B;

Fast fwd to now. And just during this last lockdown I got a little depressed and down and feeling sorry for myself, and started smoking again but also this time I was smoking weed. I was smoking both pretty heavily. Then I realised to myself after a few months what on earth am I doing? Gotta sort myself out.

&#x200B;

So I decided to quit again. Now in a couple of days it will be 3 weeks. This time I'm feeling the same type of physical things as before, but a lot worse! 

&#x200B;

Heart palps are really strong especially if I have a coffee. I haven't slept in about 10 days hardly at all. Feel just terrible. Occasionally when I deep breath, fees like I have to ""catch a breath"" sometimes. Unlike before don't have the energy to exercise which really helped last time. Will try and rectify

&#x200B;

Should physical symptons really last this long? If it continues will get it checked out. But just wondering if anyone else has ever had physical symptoms that last for  3weeks?

I am a 30yo male and I started smoking at 22. I was at a festival, having a great time with friends, a little drunk and someone kept giving me cigarettes. I'm not making excuses,  because even being drunk doesn't warrent a bad decision in my own personal opinion, but I just didn't say no to any of them. The next day I woke up and immediately wanted to smoke. Fast forward 8 years and it's the worst decision I've ever made in my life.

I want to quit so badly, to get rid of the tight chest, the phlegmy cough, the smell on my clothes and the horrid taste from my mouth. 

I've tried quitting so many times using different methods (Vape, tablets from the NHS (can't remember their name), going cold turkey, gum, patches) and none of them work. I literally cannot get past the anxiety of not smoking, my brain doesn't let that shit leave when I try to not have one. I literally start to panic if I don't smoke, which is weird because when I'm working I have to go 4 hours between cigarettes and don't think about it until it's almost break time.

The mission does say to share so perhaps indirectly it might be helpful to someone. 

So first time a few years ago it was cold turkey. Can‚Äôt remember how long it worked. 

Last 2 times were with patches and Smoke Free app and both went to just over 3 months. This time there are some differences. 

All previous times I took the approach that for every 5 days smoke free I could have a cig on the next day. Basically decrease smoking with some rewards. This worked for some weeks but then the reward increased to 2 cigs sometimes 3, and delay decreased down to about 4. As the patch strength decreased this ended in failure.  I also wanted to quit, made a promise to quit, and understood the pros vs cons. But I guess full strategy was flawed (at least for me). 

This time I noticed smoking wasn‚Äôt helping with state of mind, I felt it added some anxiety. So I decreased from a pack a day to half a pack over about a month. This was achievable since I was more concerned about the anxiety. After a month I realised that even half a pack wasn‚Äôt helping so again I went the patch route. However I started on 2nd strength since I was down to half a pack. After the first week the patch packet ran out and I forgot to replace it from a stash cupboard to closer to my morning routine. By midday I was saying to my wife that I feel a bit strange but not sure what‚Äôs up. By afternoon I realised I didn‚Äôt have a patch on. I thought about whether to put one on but the feeling didn‚Äôt feel so bad or unbearable so thought I could resist until bedtime and I did. Next day I decided no patch as it‚Äôs supposedly 3-4 days to rid the body of nicotine and from then on it‚Äôs not physical but psychological addiction. I was able to survive a day at a time until at 4 days I knew the nicotine was gone. Now I‚Äôm at day 23 which all but 7 without any NRT. Never been here before. 

What is different is I have a need rather than just a want, and without NRT I now know it‚Äôs all psychological from here on. I still use the Smoke Free app daily to see progress made for motivation.  I still get desires (I can‚Äôt now call them physical cravings) but resist them by delay drink do something but they aren‚Äôt super strong. If they are I go and tell my wife that it‚Äôs a stronger one and it passes while I‚Äôm not alone. 

I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôll make it to 3 months again. I‚Äôm not a house drinker and pandemic is restricting social drinking so there‚Äôs no temptation there. However, eventual first drink and social occasion around smokers will be tough. Will be printing out and displaying reasons for not smoking around the house before social occasions become a thing again. 

Do I feel better after 23 days of not smoking? I guess yes. No longer added anxiety from cigs. Coughing is less but still there in the mornings (can‚Äôt wait for that to disappear). I‚Äôm surprised that my O2 levels haven‚Äôt changed. They were 96-97 before and still now, although I have hit 98 on a rare occasion. I don‚Äôt stink of smoke anymore and that makes being close to my kids and wife so much enjoyable for both of us. As it‚Äôs winter then not having to get dressed up for going outside is a plus. And longer term hopefully surviving longer to see some grandkids would be fantastic but as someone said in another thread, longer term benefits rarely are the strongest motivators.

edit: oh and saving money from not needing NRT is a good feeling. Patches here are same cost as a daily packet of cigs so if I dropped to half a packet I‚Äôd be paying double.",2,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.997755229473114}"

It's like every time I take a haul off of a cig, it creates this biological reaction in my throat/lungs where I immediately have this coughing sensation like a huge wad of phlegm just formed in my lungs that never used to happen.

I used to just lightly cough up some gunk, spit it out and then move on for the rest of my day.

Now, it's like an exorcism of my lungs every morning. Some days I'm afraid I'm going to suffocate on my own gunk in my throat and I'm taking Robitussin to loosen it up. And it's happening throughout the day as well.

My body is clearly telling me to quit smoking. Frankly I'm afraid of going to a doctor about it.

Today is 7 years and 7 days without smoking, after having smoked for just over 20 yeas. Most of which was over a pack a day. My last cigarette I remember taking a breath in, and feeling a tightness in my chest. I've had anxiety issues for a long time so at first I wasn't sure if it was an anxiety attack out of no where, or was I actually about to die. Then I realized on my next drag that it was only when I took a drag. I remember sitting there on the porch in the snow, looking at this stupid thing in my hand. Thinking to myself that I had a girlfriend inside that was very allergic to the smoke and this thing was literally killing me. I could feel it killing me. I was an active participant in it killing me. It was that moment I flicked it, half smoked into a snow bank, stood up and walked in. I looked at my girlfriend with tears in my eyes and explained what I had felt out there. I crushed the rest of my pack and said ""I'm done. Never again.""

I started quitting by switching to an e-cig. I used it at first as often as I felt the need. It was just nicotine so I felt it was ""better"" for me. Eventually I pushed myself after a month or so, to only a few times a day. Then it got to the point where it was more annoying than anything. I wasn't getting the smoking feeling anymore. I was just feeding an addiction. I truly enjoy the taste of the smoke, and that was gone. So I stopped. The next week was hell. No easy way to put it, it was hell. For me and everyone around me. I was a rage monster. Those that knew me were ok with it, they knew the process, they knew what it would take. But I felt terrible. But that feeling of how I was acting I directed at the smoking. I knew that it was the addiction that was making me act out in this way. It wasn't me, not really. So it enforced in me that I continue. I had to finish this, otherwise I was just a jerk. Each day it got easier. Each day I could say no stronger. I always tell people, to this day I want a cigarette just as much as I did the day I quit. Today it's just easier to say no. I'm stronger than the addiction.

Why I quit cold turkey: Short answer, I didn't. I tried pretty much everything on the market. At about 10 years in I tried the patch. That was horrible for my body. Any limb I would put it on would go numb within an hour., which is quite unpleasant. When I talked to my Dr about it he said stop the patch, try the gum. So I bought a box. It tasted like I was chewing a wad a pepper in my mouth, so I tried the spearmint and other flavors. It was spearmint tasting pepper.. I couldn't handle it, and it didn't seem to do enough for me. So I tried Zyban, this little purple pill who's instructions said take this every day and on the 15th day you'll quit smoking. And it worked. The 15th day came around and it was in the afternoon when one of my smoking buddies asked if I wanted to go for a smoke break, and I realized I hadn't had one all day. I felt great! It was a life changer, I thought I was in control. Until day 17 and I broke out in the worst case of hives I've ever had in my entire life. All over. **ALL** over. Went to the Dr, he said we have to take you off of it. I said, no give me something to counteract this. Couldn't do it, I had to stop taking it. I was smoking within 2 days. Years later I tried Chantix when that came out, because it was supposed to be the new wonder drug.. I would not recommend that to anyone with my experience I had with it.. (not to say it won't work for you, but know this going into it) I had the most vivid dreams, to the point I would chat with friends the next day as if it was a memory, only to find out it was a dream. The problem was, it also increased my nightmares. And they were just as vivid. I believe I can tell you what it feels like to be chased by an axe murderer. And be caught. Or to be chased by a 15' tall hawk, and caught, and eaten. As the nightmares increased more and more, my friends noticed I was getting depressed. They started asking me if I was ok. And until they did I didn't realize I was, but then I gave it some thought and realized I was really really depressed. This is a known side effect, and it was hitting me hard. So, I had to go off of it. I've tried meditation, I've tried various other things like that. In the end for me, I had to do cold turkey. It was the only way my body and mind were going to let go. I hope beyond hope that others have better luck with the methods that didn't work for me. But if not, just remember. It gets easier to say no. You get stronger each day. And you will over come this addiction. I believe in you.",20,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9990541338920593}"

I quit smoking almost two years ago, haven‚Äôt had a cigarette since.
I used the patch, and it worked.
Here‚Äôs the problem, I haven‚Äôt stopped using the patch.
In fact in recent months I‚Äôve upped the patch dose to 28mg daily, or 2X14mg patches.
Pretty pissed at myself, since last summer I was down to a half of one 7mg. 
The last few months have been brutal as far as stress goes, I know it‚Äôs not an excuse, but here I am. I told myself ‚Äòat least I‚Äôm not smoking‚Äô.

I decided this last week, enough was enough, so I took one patch out, I halved my dose.
Almost immediately I was struck with the most insane anxiety, and hypoglycemia I‚Äôve ever experienced. Internal tremors, racing heart, higher blood pressure.
The next day I used two patches again, and I felt better for about an hour, and then the same symptoms occurred, with the original dose. It‚Äôs been a week and a half of trying a lower dose, getting symptoms, then going back to a higher dose and getting symptoms. What have I done?

Part of me is thinking I shouldn‚Äôt have halved my dose, but instead tapered slowly, and part of me is thinking I should increase to alleviate symptoms. I don‚Äôt think the latter is a good idea, so I won‚Äôt do that.
And yet another part of me is thinking about going cold turkey and riding it out, but I feel like I‚Äôm going to die, the withdrawals are beyond what I thought they would be.

Essentially I don‚Äôt know if the lowering of the dose is what is causing this, or the repeated going back and forth? Is it high nicotine that‚Äôs causing this or low nicotine?

Day 1: Kinda sucked
Day 2: Intense cravings that I combatted by drinking lots of water, sucking on ice, and chewing on a straw
Day3: No cravings today but I felt a bit physically ill cause of anxiety. Not a whole lot of appetite, brain fog, and a headache. I‚Äôm feeling a lot better now that it‚Äôs the evening and I‚Äôve worked out and had a meal, though.

Problem is, I‚Äôm seeing my girlfriend tomorrow and she has a vape. It kind of frustrates me cause any time we FaceTime she flaunts it around and when I ask her not to do that cause it triggers cravings, she apologized and unknowingly will hit her vape on camera or something of the sorts. It makes me jealous, to be honest.
Anyway, I‚Äôm seeing her tomorrow and it‚Äôs going to be incredibly tempting for me to ask to hit it. I really don‚Äôt think I should cause I‚Äôm already 3 days in. Why is a 15 second buzz worth my 3 days of work? Fuck. I‚Äôm so conflicted.

The reason i'm making this post is because i have a couple of questions about this whole process. Not only that but i'm about 4 days in, so i'm unfortunately going through a rough patch, and maybe talking to people who have gone through the same will give me the ambition to keep it going.

For context, I'm 23, smoked my first cigarette when i was 13, became a big problem when i was 14, and i've smoked pretty much everyday since. Needless to say i wasn't the brightest kid, but it is what it is.

The first two days were ok. I was actually able to study for a couple of hours, nothing too excessive but it is better than nothing .Today, however, was a mess.

I just felt absolutely awful the whole day, it's like the cravings won't go away. I can't concentrate in anything, and i've just been sitting here by the computer listening to music and chewing gum for hours, just trying to think about something else.

So, my question is, and I know that this is very subjective, but just so i can get the hang of what might happen:

When did you guys notice that you were able to concentrate like you used to do ?

When did the cravings stop being pretty much all you thought about ?

Been lurking in on this community for a year or 2 now but finally decided to take on the little smoking monster that has lived inside of me for over 10 years now.

Recently due to lockdown/WFH etc i have started smoking up-to 40 a day now which has taken its toll on my health and my bank balance. 

I've wanted to quit for a while, but recently realised there is absolutely no pros to smoking, only cons.

I finished reading Allen carr's easy way to stop smoking today and can confidently say going forward i am now a NON-SMOKER. 

Even though i'm confident in this journey i'm about to take on, i realise this will not be an easy feat. So any advice or tips that any of you previous smokers have, or any that or just starting like me, i would be grateful. 

If any of you fellow redditers would like to come back to this post every now and again and check in with me/see how i'm getting on I think that would be also help.

I'm so proud to announce that today, I'm joining everyone in the fight to quit smoking.

I started off with snus pouches, which graduated to chew, then to cigarettes. I swapped over to Juul, thinking that I was making a positive change. But in reality, I had never truly escaped the nicotine addiction; I was just substituting it for another.

I'm 28, & when I realized that I had been reliant on nicotine for nearly 1/4 of my life, it felt like this was the best time to kick the habit. I had just recently gotten into a relationship, & I never wanted to have this conversation of being a smoker, embarrassingly excusing myself or ripping the Juul during bathroom breaks.

Today, I decided that there's never going to be the ""right"" time to quit smoking. I always had thought I would need to carve out days where I wouldn't be stressed in order to quit, but I was just kicking the can & building this up to be an impossible task. After perusing this subreddit & seeing everyone have success, it made **me** want to have that success as well. I'm not quitting out of fear, but rather quitting to feel the same empowerment as all of you.

About 5 minutes ago, I filled up a water bottle & dropped my Juul device inside. It was admittedly a scary thought at first, but I actually felt an incredible amount of strength in doing so.

I just started doing online school and I believe the smoking is disrupting my focus and causing me sleeping difficulties which makes it difficult to do school every day.

Been lurking here forever and it's time for me to quit. I've done it successfully once or twice in the past for a few months or so at a time. Tried a year ago with Chantix but never actually stopped.

Snowed in with 10 cigs left, Pall Mall 100s which I hate. My father smokes them, they are 'ours'. So tired of feeling like a slave. Got the app, been clean an hour now. Which is longer than I consciously have gone without a cigarette in a long time (including sleeping even sometimes). I've always been an addict and I overcame a decade long heroin/meth IV addiction through getting put into America's lovely justice system over dealing to support my habit culminating in 5 years probation, 3 rehabs (one of which was 6 months in jail, 6 months out), a 30 day program, a 1.2 year stint in jail narrowly avoiding prison. 

Now I am clean over a year. Perhaps a year and a half. I do still smoke weed and take suboxone and psyche meds (legally prescribed by doctor) but that doesn't bother me. One thing at a time, one day at a time as they say, eh?

I've read Allen Carr multiple times and might reread it now, despite his unflinching insisent you smoke while reading it. I think I have some ancient nicotine gum somewhere. I have one bottle of Chantix I saved from before. I have the resolve in a coinflip moment. I have one of those apps with the pretty badges (used some of my google play points, fuck it - if I can pay 6 bucks or more a day for smokes damn well I can justify a one time 5 dollar app purchase). I declared to my extended family I'm making the attempt in a hope for accountability - same motivation for posting here. 

This is gonna suck, I'm already obese and god knows the anxiety gonna make me eat more. Fuck. Wish me luck!

I thought I had had that moment a few times recently and then immediately lit up. SEIZE THE IMPULSE IF YOU HAVEN'T! 

Let me end with a quote that resonated with me in my youth while reading the incomparable greats of literature - in particular, this one from Moby Dick (Herman Melville)

>""Some moments passed, during which the thick vapor came from his mouth in quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face. 'How now,' he soliloqized at last, withdrawing the tube, 'this smoking no longer soothes. Oh my pipe! hard it must go with me if thy charm be gone! Here I have been unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring, -- aye, and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to windward, and with such nervous whiffs, like the dying whale, my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble. \[It could be that Ahab's conscience bothers him after insulting Stubb.\] What business have I with this pipe? This thing that is meant for sereneness, to send up mild white vapors among mild white hairs, not among torn iron-grey locks like mine. I'll smoke no more --'

>""He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed in the waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made. With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.""

I even have journal entries when I was in 12th grade where I literally scolding myself and trying to talk myself into abandoning this disgusting habit. But years later the vice just became worse. I couldn't quit because all my friends are smokers, and I keep believing that if I refrain from smoking I'll miss out on lots of things. Most of the time even just the idea of quitting seems like abandoning my own sense of identity.

About a year ago I miraculously managed to go through a month without cigarettes, and I've never felt so good about myself. I don't know how to put it exactly, but I was definitely a happier person. At about two weeks, indulging in a single puff seemed like declaring to myself that I was a failure. I was repulsed by smoking. Not to mention the money I saved. And I even bought an awesome backpack from the cigarette money for two weeks that I saved

But something snapped. I can't recall what it was but there was a huge chance that drinking made resulted to relapse.

I've been attempting to quit cold turkey for more than two months now, but the funny thing is I don't want to start quitting when I've already had a single stick, and every day I keep fooling myself into thinking this day will be the last. Worse, I always want to make the most of my last day of smoking, so I ended up consuming twice the number of cigarettes I used to smoke!

So i had many ups and downs with giving up smoking, but i finally quit 1 week ago today (hopefully for good) after reading the book which helped change my view a little. Also my bff is pregnant and she had to quit cold turkey after finding out so it was the perfect moment for me to quit as well.
It‚Äôs been a lot easier than the other times i gave up smoking, because the book helped me see smoking in a different view, although i still struggle at times. The problem is with my friend, who is actually a bit depressed, tells me how much she loves and misses smoking and how she regrets not having had one last cigarette before having the pregnancy test. I told her that she should read the book, as i think it will help change her view and prevent her from starting smoking again after giving birth (which she actually plans to do). The problem is the beginning of the book, which starts by pointing out the ‚Äòbenefits‚Äô of smoking, and i am afrait it will do her more harm than good. Also, another thing i liked and kept me interested in reading was the fact that i ‚Äòwas allowed‚Äô to smoke while reading, which she isn‚Äôt.
So the question is, should i still tell her to read it or it will make giving up even more difficult and maybe she‚Äôll give up reading before getting to the good part, making her struggle even more?",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9968053102493286}"

I started smoking cannabis, assuming it was easier for me to quit than cigarettes, and justified that I would smoke herbs until I could stop smoking tobacco. I am now 55 days clean of nicotine, and am day 1 into again not smoking cannabis. It is so much harder this time around, and I'm realizing how addicted I am to the ACT of smoking, beyond the addiction to what I was smoking.

Today my brain tried justifying smoking other non-habit forming herbs (if that even exists) or herbal smoke blends, but figure that's just covering up the issue.

Caffeine causes your body to release adrenaline and cortisol, two chemicals that can be responsible for feelings of anxiety. When I quit coffee, the intensity of my symptoms decreased. As it turns out, nicotine also releases a lot of adrenaline and cortisol. I wonder if I quit nicotine now, if the last of my anxiety symptoms will fade away with time?

I lived in Vietnam and became addicted to the local tobacco there calles thu·ªëc lao. It's 9x stronger than cigarettes and is smoked through a bong and is so strong that regular cigarette smokers can, and often do, pass out when smoking it. I smoked this pipe around 8x a day for 2 years.
Quit drinking around 1.5 years ago and I've been trying to quit nicotiene altogether since September. I keep reaching around the 6 week mark and relapsing for a week or a day and having a few cigs then quitting again.
How can i quit for good and not have these pestering feelings hanging around? 
I had a dream that i had my Vietnamese tobacco and i wanted to smoke it so badly and my girlfriend wouldn't let me so i dug my own grave and sat in it and smoked a bowl. Woke up with such a huge craving.

Please wish me luck.,"Thanks to the craziness that happened on Wall Street bets, I became a stock trader overnight. Now that I feel a little more comfortable using Reddit as an aid in life decisions, I decided to join this sub for some help and support. I had plans to quit smoking at the beginning of this year. I walked out to my usual spot lit up a cigarette right before midnight and promised myself that I would quit. 2021 was going to be my clean year. It didn't last.

I first started smoking late in life. I was 32 when I smoked my first pack with some of my grad school friends. The funny thing about smoking is that it usually starts off as a social activity, but once the friends go away you're left with the craving. For over three years this became my new normal and I never even considered myself a smoker. At most I would have anywhere between 7 to 10 cigarettes a day and I figured that it wasn't enough to classify me as a smoker. This is a lie that caused me to go back to the gas stations multiple times for my ‚Äúlast pack.‚Äù 

I can't speak for everyone but, I wanted to pick Valentine's Day of 2021 to be the first real day in which I made a full effort to finally beat this Beast. Since I'm single, I would always chalk up my smoking to acclimating my body to any social situation without the fear of worrying a significant other. I would always be the one in my group of friends that would have that fresh pack of American Spirits ready and also be able to drink everyone under the table. But I have recently come to terms that this wasn't a form of jovial community expression, but a deep-seated self-loathing that I'm dealing with. I didn't have to worry about my health because there was no one there to worry about it. I saw being single as being expendable. Since Valentine's Day is known as a day for the love between couples, I wanted to memorialize this day as a day on which I finally started loving myself. I know smoking was something that I had to quit and I was saving that occasion for when I found a significant other. 

If you have this mindset, please know that waiting to rectify all of your addictions and personality flaws when you meet your future lover is too much of an unfair responsibility to give them. I can't think of a better form of self-love than eliminating something that will slowly kill your spirit and your body.  Over the course of my three years of smoking, I can't begin to tell you how many times I've ‚Äúquit.‚Äù I wanted to share this with you all as hopefully a way to have some kind of accountability. I don't want my future self looking back on this thread with a cigarette in my mouth reading about the hopes he had for 2021.

Hey everyone!  
 

For a bit of background: I began smoking in 2015 which became heavier and heavier. I made about ten attempts to quit over the next few years but was never successful for more than a few days as I couldn‚Äôt bear the withdrawal symptoms. In 2018 I switched over to vaping (with great difficulty) and stuck with that until I took up smoking again during a particularly stressful period.   
 

The relapse into smoking triggered an extreme depression in me; I began to believe I wouldn‚Äôt ever be able to quit nicotine and that I was kind of trapped. It was during one of these self-loathing moments when I remembered my copy of ‚ÄúAllen Carr‚Äôs Easy Way to Stop Smoking‚Äù that I brought during my previous attempt to quit but never read as I switched to vaping. I looked up the reviews and discovered it had very strong feedback from its customers, but I still remained sceptical. Nonetheless, I decided to give it a shot.   
 

Long story short, I am currently on Day 8 without smoking and I shit you not the only withdrawal symptoms I‚Äôve had are one mild pang of anxiety on Day 3 and a few slight headaches that were quickly remedied by caffeine. I have no desire whatsoever to smoke again and I haven‚Äôt felt this good physically and mentally for years!  
 

I just want to clarify that this book certainly isn‚Äôt the ‚Äúbe all end all‚Äù for stopping smoking - I believe everyone has a cessation method that will work best for them! But if you‚Äôre like me and have tried everything from cold turkey to patches to gum, give this book a shot. I‚Äôm still astonished just how well it worked for me and fingers crossed this post will lead to at least one more person giving up nicotine as well!   
 

P.S. I believe you should read the book in its entirety in one sitting (its pretty short at 110 pages approx.) and make sure you‚Äôre able to smoke while you‚Äôre doing so. I think both of these factors helped in reinforcing the messages of the book, at least for me.",14,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.980255126953125}"

To be honest i was able to quit cigarettes much easier then i thought. I had no belief in myself. Because i always wanted more cigarettes then all of my friends
If you‚Äôre struggling to quit start going to the gym first thing in the morning..i did that..and try to give your best in the gym and eating right..try to improve your strength and you‚Äôll find you‚Äôre out of breath so early..i used to get out of breath just after warm up in the gym..and then i remember i used to watch videos and articles where they say how its much harder for smokers to get jacked..so i got to a health consciousness stage where i actually started to panic..i just strongly believed at that time that if i can quit smoking i can become strong really fast


So i finally just decided to try and see if i can go 1 day without smoking..as one day passed by and i‚Äôm up early at the time of my smoke and atm i am just sitting thinking about what will happen next? I will smoke one and in a couple hours i‚Äôll be wanting another one.
One smoke lasts about 5-6 minutes max.
When you get the nicotine cravings before smoking just visualise what will happen after 5 minutes,
Visualise yourself throwing that cigarette bud away after smoking.
Each day you will feel better then the previous day
This worked for me like a charm i‚Äôd recommend for anyone if they haven‚Äôt tried this, if you exercise in the morning your day will be much more positive you‚Äôll feel much easier to say no to a cigarette and will feel more proud of yourself..it was so hard for me to even think about quitting i‚Äôm still struggling trying to quit weed now though. good luck guys",146,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9731844067573547}"

3. Start smoking less every day.

4. Buy a disposable vape, you can find one for as cheap as $10 that includes 1,500 puffs (SoulVape, Yuoto, etc) 

5. Keep yourself active, do things you enjoy or watch movies.

I've tried and failed multiple times. This is okay. Every time you quit, you get better at quitting. You workout that self control muscle.

Step one: isolate yourself from triggers. Limit your time around smokers for at least the first month.

Step two: substitutions. You'll need to fill that dopamine void. Don't use food. Use exercise, as an example.

Step three (most important): Ask yourself, do you want to be a smoker? (Whether you want a cigarette or not is irrelevant). If the answer is no, I don't want to be a smoker: why smoke?

This last point helped me greatly. I don't know if it will help other people. But realising I don't actually want to be a smoker was a big step towards realising that I was only fooling myself and preventing me from getting what I *want*.

I don't miss cigarettes. I've forgotten what it's like. I've changed my whole lifestyle. I'm far healthier. I eat well. I exercise. My BMI is almost ""ideal"", for the first time in years.

To summarise: avoid triggers, find positive ways to fill the void, and most importantly, realise what you actually want.

Also, another point - recognise that the ""feeling"" of cigarettes is just that. A feeling. It goes away. You won't remember it. And it's not real.",15,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9822582006454468}"

Should I avoid recommending shows/movies with heavy smoking imagery?," Hello, sorry if this isn't the right place to ask, but I'm just trying to get some advice on how to be supportive. 

I  don't smoke, but I'm friends with someone who used to vape heavily. It was taking a toll on his health (heavy coughing, etc) and with effort, support, and time, he quit. I couldn't be more proud of him. But he thinks about smoking a lot, especially whenever he's stressed out. He's told me before that whenever he sees characters smoking, it triggers that want in him.

Should I avoid recommending shows that have characters smoking? We have similar taste  in media and whenever I see it, it barely registers to me. But he's under stress right now, so I don't want to recommend something that'll increase his urge to smoke. I've never personally been addicted to a  substance so I was hoping to get some more insight into how he feels.

(Also,  I'd rather not ask him what he thinks about this, because then the smoking thing will be pushed to the forefront of his mind every time I recommend something. I don't want him to know I'm censoring my recommendations at all, I'd rather just quietly do it when he's stressed)",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9928774237632751}"

Sometimes it makes my vape taste chemically, but the cravings are still strong and often. I tried to quit a few months ago cold turkey and made it 23hrs before I was in full meltdown and started again. I've quit hard drugs and weed, but nicotine has been by far the worst.

I have an appointment with a nuerosurgeon early next month and likely am going to be having surgery. It's also highly likely I'll have to quit smoking to be eligible for surgery. So this is kind of a do or die situation. My life is really stressful and I don't see that slowing down anytime soon. So losing my last ""chemical romance"" so to speak will be that much harder. That and I genuinely like the act of smoking. Not so much the nicotine. 

I started smoking because I couldn't smoke weed in public or at work and that was my main source of smoking. Now the tables have turned. I guess I just expected more from the Chantix? I know it's still early on, but I'm kinda bummed. That and it makes me so damn tired and makes my chest hurt sometimes which I know isn't good. It's not the worst I've felt chest pain wise before though so I'm hoping it evens out in a few days. I just really need this to work. Or at least make it easier for me. I deal with the public for a living and I have to keep my composure.

Anybody have experience with Chantix? I read some posts here, but some further encouragement would be appreciated. I'm just having a hard time coming to terms with a lot of things in life right now and I need to get this whole smoking thing behind me. I'd say the will is there to quit, but my body/mental state is weak.

But most importantly I'm so thankful to myself I quit, I appreciate all the effort past-me put into it so I could enjoy it now. I'm proud I'm managed to quit, it wasn't easy.

It freaked me out so I immediately put out my cigarette and haven't had one since. 

The first week I was able to ride the scared wave that I was on, since the wheezing noise freaked me out. Now that some time has passed, I am in this phase of bargaining.

I haven't let myself give in yet, but I needed to talk to someone that understands what I am going through. I'm looking for advice and maybe some hope that this whole bargaining stage that I am in will subside. Also, I've had a really stressful week and my anxieties have been out of control. Smoking was a comfort for me when stress or anxiety got the best of me.

I used to check this sub every day for months for motivation and I really do thank you all for that! Just know it‚Äôs possible, and it gets easier. I stand by my original post below which I wrote after only 32 days after quitting. I still had a few cravings a day until around somewhere 90 to 100 days in. DON‚ÄôT LET THAT DISCOURAGE YOU. The cravings are manageable after a couple weeks, what I am saying is I really didn‚Äôt have a thought at all after 100 days, and it was like how I felt when I was young and I never tried them in the first place. Be ready for season changes as well because you might quit all winter and think you have already won and then summer nights come back and all the sudden you get that urge out of nowhere. Don‚Äôt get too cocky. I had failed a previous attempt before this at around 55 days in and went back to smoking a pack a day for almost a year before I finally was successful. I know I wrote a lot but at least if you‚Äôre stuck reading this you‚Äôre probably not smoking which is good haha. Hopefully you can use some of what worked for me and make it work for you. I look forward for you to join me on this side! Thanks again

I personally find it better to quit when the only way to get cigs are from the gas station and you don't have extras laying around ( I know I would of relapsed a few times if I had some).

 I had nothing planned for the next few days so it was perfect. I slept for as long as I could to avoid cravings, (probably around 14 hours) I spent most of day 1 eating peanut M&amp;Ms or taking long showers when I felt those intense cravings. Day 1-3 are unbearable, but made it through with eating until my stomach literally hurt, showering a lot and cutting my night short with sleeping pills. I would also spend a lot of time googling things like ""quit smoking timeline"" and read different benefits of quitting, and ""when cravings would stop"". 

I would tell myself that if I can last a week, I could quit for good. Baby steps.... I was not thinking about the month, more or less I just did everything in my power to make it to a week. Once I hit one week, things were a lot better, but I still was getting really bad cravings, not as bad as the first 4 days though, but if you can make it through the first week, the second week is a cake-walk in comparison.

 I started exercising around 10 days in and running about a mile or so a day. Working out or running really does relieve stress and I don't care how big you are or how out of shape you are, do something to push yourself and you will feel BETTER ( maybe not during the run or lifting, but afterwards). This helps because setting goals exercise-wise will sway you further from smoking because you know smoking will take you further from those goals, or that's how I think about it anyway.

Around day 19ish I noticed I wasn't even thinking about cigs when first getting into my car, or after a big meal etc, although certain things brought cravings. On my way to work in the mornings, I would always buy a 5 hour energy extra strength with my pack of cigs, and after my quit I hardly ever went inside gas stations, but one day I was really tired and bought a 5 hour energy and BAM instead of waking me up, it just made me think about cigs for around 5 hours. These unexpected cravings will show up and you need to be ready for them and not give in. I read on this Reddit about someone that quit smoking for over 2 years and flew for the first time since he quit. After the plane landed and he got his luggage he had a strange urge for the first time in a very long time to smoke, because that is what he always used to do after getting out of the airport. Things like this will happen so just be ready is my advice.

Things are so much better for me now on day 32. I work an 8 hour shift without thinking about how I can sneak away for that cig, you don't feel that social stigma associated with being a smoker. I would always say I don't care what people thought of me when I did smoke, but there were times where I was on a first date or was around an attractive girl, job interview etc. and wanted to hide that I smoked, that issue is now gone. When I do get that occasional craving, it really is not that hard to deal with. I feel better mentally and can say I really am enjoying life more than before. If you are on the first week of quitting, or thinking about starting that quit, but worried that it is TOO HARD to quit forever, don't think of it like that. Think about just quitting for a week, make a week your goal and work from there. It gets easier, TRUST ME.

Also you need to quit for you. because it is so FUCKING hard to quit you will be expecting friends or family to be overly proud of you and extremely supportive, which may happen, but most of my friends and family had an attitude like "" It's about time"" and would never understand what you and I had to go through. Honestly don't worry about them and remember that you are doing this for yourself.

I will never be that non-smoker to tell people that they need to quit. That shit is so annoying for a smoker to hear all day. I know that if they do quit it needs to be because they want to do it for themselves. Most smokers really do want to quit and if they notice you quit successfully and how happy you are now, that will be enough motivation to where you do not need to say much. Lead by example

My journey is not even close to over, but these are my feelings after one month. I believe in you guys!
Good luck everyone! ‚Äú

Yesterday, I went down to the parking lot of my apartment building. I thought I would only have to wait 5 minutes for my dad to arrive with my groceries (I don't drive so he's been picking up groceries for me during covid). Well there was an accident on one of the main roads so he ended up being about 15 minutes. 

While I was out there, a man came out of my apartment building with his dog just to do his business, and this man lights a smoke, because what smoker doesn't have a cigarette when they're outside anyway? 

I think I seemed creepy tbh because I kept looking over at him and thinking about asking him for a smoke and I tried to play it off like I was looking at his dog (which was a very pretty dog btw). 

Anyway... I didn't ask because obviously that would be absolutely insane to talk to a stranger during a pandemic and even worse to ask them to hand you something and borrow a lighter.... 

Ugh. Now that I've been inside for so long without access to cigarettes, I'm worried I'll pick up the habit again from bumming them off people when I can finally leave my house. 

Also... yeah... I'm super depressed and almost don't see the point of not smoking other than it saves money (money I don't have in the first place so my credit card was maxed out 100% of the time).",4,"{'covid': 1, 'pandemic': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9991022348403931}"

Unfortunately, I've been exposed to smoking cigarettes at a young age and I was successful (at the time) to quit for 6-7 years until I went through a mental breakdown in 2019. Since then, I would switch back from vape mods, disposable pens, and eventually fully depend on cigarettes because the buzz was not enough from the other two. 

I noticed I'm able to withstand a week cold turkey. But I fall back into the cycle before reaching my 2nd week. To be honest, I personally feel like I'm better off doing this cold turkey instead of tapering down, because I think tapering will only lead me to fail.  I was off nicotine for mostly the entire day today until an hour ago because the mental craving was just too much for me to ignore. I only had one cigarette today compared to most days where I usually have 5-6 per day.

I have quit 5 weeks now (after 2 packs a day for years). I can't say the change I feel is huge. 5 weeks surely not enough to reap the fruits but still... I hoped I would feel better to be honest. After 3 weeks I made a short review here also claiming that I taste and smell better and that breathing improved. Today I am not so sure if those were more wishful thinking than what I really felt.... Anyway, I will keep going.

I am currently working on my dissertation project and I have constructed a study looking at the effects that Mindfulness Intervention (MI) and Classical Music Intervention has on smoking habits. If possible, I would appreciate anybody who considers themselves a smoker to take part in this study!

The following study has three stages:

1. An initial survey to acquire background information regarding smoking habits alongside some questionnaires.
2. A two-week trial in which MI or the classical music intervention will be administered (10 minutes a day for 14 days).
3. A follow up survey.

All data obtained will be kept strictly confidential and you have the right to withdraw your data any time before the write up of the study has been finalized.

If you are currently a smoker who is looking to cut down or quit entirely, I highly recommend the proposed study.

I've been trying to quit for over 2 years with no luck.so over a year ago I changed my goals. Instead of my goal being to quit, it was to make myself dislike cigarettes. Liking cigarettes is such an illusion. Awhile ago when I tried, and failed, to quit by using medications I noticed it made them taste awful. So I took on a similar method. 

I started with patches and gums at the same time. This is very easy to do. Its easy to not smoke with the patch on your arm and gum in your mouth. I stayed on the highest mg of each for as long as I wanted. And usually after a few weeks I would cave and go smoke. But now that its been a few weeks the smokes tasted TERRIBLE. So right then and there I would quit again. After a few days I would drop down the mg of each. Then a few more weeks would go by and I would cave. Same result they taste terrible, quit again. And I kept doing this. Eventually I gave up thr gum and was on the smallest mg patch. When I would cave not only would it taste terrible, but I could feel heart pain, head pain, and felt sick. I would notice this, and quit again. So even though I had smoked a few times, sometimes I even a whole pack, I had become aware of how bad they tasted and how bad they hurt me. It had been months since I had actually that ""good"" cigarette taste.  And all I could think about was how bad they tasted and how they made me feel. That's when I won. And thats when I took that patch off. And I've been free since. 

Anytime I failed to quit in the past, it wasn't bc of nicotine cravings, it was bc that illusion of them tasting good and making me feel good was in my head. Now that illusion is broken. So make your failed quit attempts work for you!",9,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9991399049758911}"

This is my first time making any type of thread. But I felt like after sharing with my friends, I needed to share on a larger scale. If this can help even one person i‚Äôll be so happy.

Without Further Ado:


reconquer your lungs: lei‚Äôs guide to quitting nic

‚Äúsome people get lost in their fires. others are forged from them‚Äù

lads and ladies, i hope you are ready to forge yourself anew from kicking this addiction to the curb. strap in cause this is a long one 


1. kill the romance: we all have our reasons for getting ourselves hooked on nicotine. it‚Äôs easy to surrender to a lifestyle of cheap thrills when you‚Äôre stuck in a mental hell. but cheap thrills are quite ironic, considering how physically and emotionally expensive/taxing they become. there is nothing cheap about them. the only cheap thing that comes from nicotine is that it cheapens YOU. nic addictions remind me a lot of toxic romance. we love the way something makes us feel, and the way it makes us look to others, so we overlook all the red flags we know are lurking in the background. think about the money you spend weekly on nic. have you ever fully done the calculation on how much $$$ you‚Äôve spent on nic? my guess is no.  because you know if you did, you would have tangible evidence of how unsustainable a nicotine addiction is. so how do you stop romanticizing it? quitting is more psychological than physical. nicotine rewires the way you think completely. it becomes the thing you look forward to the most. even when you have a stick, you look forward to finishing it and opening a new one for that fresh hit. the physical cravings are definitely real, but once you get through that, it‚Äôs the mentality that is the hardest thing to shake. in order to stop romanticizing it, you have to really do the math of how much you‚Äôve spent on it since you have started vaping. on top of that, outline every ugly thing it does to you and your life. it‚Äôs a scary thought, but you have to show yourself the reality of what you‚Äôre doing to yourself. not to mention the negative ambiguous effects it has on your body. you were lucky enough to be born breathing healthy, so why would you willingly give yourself this kind of impairment? you‚Äôre spending money to in turn spend more money in the future (when you‚Äôre paying for medical bills). if you use nicotine as a crutch to feel happy (the way i used to), just listen to this. you‚Äôre down bad now, but when you‚Äôre finally on the right trajectory, and you feel happy again, you will not wanna rely on any substance for that happiness. future you will thank you for all the money and health problems you‚Äôre saving them. really ask yourself why you haven‚Äôt quit yet. what are you waiting for exactly? 
2. purge the dead: once you‚Äôre ready to really cut nic out of your life, the first thing you need to do is find every single disposable you have laying around, and throw them all out. this is important because seeing them laying around all the time provokes unnecessary thoughts about nicotine after you quit. also prevents you from sneaking any unfulfilling hits from the dead ones. make sure that the only one you have left is your newish nic. 
3. farewell and fuck you: for me, this is one of the most crucial steps. when you decide you‚Äôre ready to quit, you can‚Äôt take your last hit from a nearly empty stick. you also can‚Äôt wait for it to die and say you‚Äôll quit then. my theory is that when your last hit is unfulfilling, it makes you want to buy another one/hit someone else‚Äôs, so that at least your last hit was a good one. problem with this is you‚Äôre never going to quit like that. once you take your final hit, you can‚Äôt keep it around. you have to throw it out even if it‚Äôs 98% full. it will always tempt you if it‚Äôs in your reach. i know it seems like a waste of money in the moment, but just think of all the money you would waste in the future. don‚Äôt make the last hit something to be sad about. it‚Äôs gonna sound so cringe, but i was blasting music dancing to my fav song and took my last hit to the best part. something about it was really empowering. it‚Äôs gotta be a moment that you remember and are proud of. 
4. wait. but what now: what they say about the three day hump IS TRUE. its all mind games. there is still nicotine in your system, and the mf is making its last attempts at getting you to buy another disposable. people say they can‚Äôt stand the physical toll that quitting takes on them. do you think it will be any easier down the line? it will only get harder to quit the longer you wait to do it. whatever habits you don‚Äôt kick, you choose. you have to develop a mentality that is stronger than your physical urges. it is much more difficult for the mind to tame itself, rather than tame the body. 
5. consider me a bitch: at some point in everyone‚Äôs school career, the case of classical conditioning with Pavlov and his Dogs was covered. my therapist once told me to snap a rubber band every time i got an urge to hit a stick. this reminded me a lot of pavlov and his bitches. so consider me and bitch. every time i have a thought about nicotine, i snap the rubber band. but no wimpy snap. you have to snap it to the point where it actually really hurts. you will have a couple welts if you do it hard enough, but these go away in like a day. by doing this every time you have a craving, you wire yourself to anticipate also feeling pain after that thought. this rewires your subconscious to actually dismiss the thought much quicker, and begin to think about it much less over time. rubber band snaps hurt much more than you think. also, seeing the welts from the rubber band remind you that every time you‚Äôre hitting nic, you‚Äôre hurting yourself. except with the rubber band you can actually see it‚Äôs affects on the surface. 
6. incentivize your life: to stick to your pledge and not buy a disposable, you have to find something that you value more than nicotine, and delay that thing until the end of the day. for me, it‚Äôs smoking weed. i would choose weed over nicotine every single time, so i told myself i could only smoke weed IF i went the whole day without hitting nicotine even one time. this really helped me because i smoked day to night before. you don‚Äôt have to choose smoking weed, it can be something like nightly youtube video sessions, or sex. literally anything that you enjoy and would really hate to miss out on.
7. what do i do with my mouth/hands: a huge problem for me was needing something to satisfy my idle moments. to satisfy the physical craving, i would squirt some lemon juice in the back of my throat, or eat something sour. this gets your saliva glands super active and satisfies that need for a physical buzz. you can also chew gum to keep your mouth busy. working out was super helpful for me in the first few days of quitting, and still is. i def recommend working out to get an adrenaline rush and also kickstart increasing your lung capacity again.
8. track that shit: this is so important. you should download this app called ‚Äúi am sober‚Äù. it helps you track your progress, and gives you daily affirmations to make. you can also read other people‚Äôs entries that are at the same level of quitting as you are which is really helpful sometimes. by tracking your progress, you create a new habit of checking in on it, and it makes it so much harder to relapse. it also tracks how much money you‚Äôre saving as well as how many mg‚Äôs you save yourself from consuming. another great app is quit genius. i like this one cause it shows you how much money you save weekly, monthly, yearly, and over a lifetime. 
9. but my friends vape around me all the time: okay this is where you get tested for real. it‚Äôs so much easier to not hit nicotine when you can‚Äôt see or smell it. once you are back in that environment, it becomes so tempting. if you really want to stay clean, you might need to limit time around certain people, or tell them to be mindful of hitting it around you. make this last till you feel like your mentality is strong enough to be around them again. i told my friends that even if i ever ask them to let me hit it, not to let me. because sometimes it only takes one hit to kickstart the whole addiction again. if you don‚Äôt wanna cut the time you spend with your friends that hit nic, then being around them has to turn into your own personal game. the game is: training yourself in real time to dismiss intrusive thoughts. you win the game after you leave there having not hit the nicotine. it really does feel like a huge accomplishment when you make it out, because it is. you may be worried you‚Äôre gonna come off like a noob, but i promise you, all your friends want to quit deep down. in due time they will all try to quit too. you have to remind yourself why you quit in the first place. remind yourself that if you give in and hit nicotine again, you‚Äôre going to have to quit all over again. remind yourself of how disappointed you will feel. in the moments where you want to smoke nic with your friends, just think to yourself of how much better off you are in that moment than them. make sure to keep the rubber band on at all social functions because that‚Äôs when it really comes in handy and can ground you. 
10. learn to fill cravings with other fulfilling things: there are too many things in this world that can make us happy for us to resort to something so blatantly harmful. sticks and juuls are the cigarettes of this generation. no one knew cigarettes caused cancer until decades after they got users hooked beyond repair. sticks have little to no data about the toll it takes on us because they‚Äôre so brand new. there are other things you can do to make you feel that rush. there are better things you can spend your money on. and if you really just love that exact feeling, plan a hookah night once a month with your friends! it will be an occasional nice thing to do and you won‚Äôt get hooked. working out is a huge thing that can benefit you physically and mentally. pickup a hobby that makes you feel good. whatever you choose to replace nicotine with, make sure it only adds to your life. 

and please remember. don‚Äôt be so hard on yourself. you‚Äôre only human, and a great one at that. you being here is already a step in the right direction.

Hopefully this works ok and the picture posts just fine. I know this might not be a huge deal to some, but it is a huge deal to me. I made it through my first work day without a smoke too. My boss and I are basically best friends. Every single morning he comes up to me and holds up his camels and says: ""Smoke?"" And I go every single time.

I still went out with him today, but I did not smoke. I watched him smoke instead. I need to still be around it. If I avoid tobacco for the rest of my life, I will one day run into it and start smoking again because it catches me off guard. I still need to briefly smell the second hand from time to time. Because if I dont, there will come a day when I catch a whiff of it and I might cave. I cannot avoid it forever. It is impossible. 

But I did it. I put away my truck today and labeled it. I used to take a break with a smoke afterward. I put away our dry stock and I did not smoke afterward. I had to make a run today which involved driving my car. And I did not smoke.

I am home now and I am done with my homework. I am watching Disney+ and playing Fallout 4. I started a new game actually! If that gets boring, I plan on continuing my progress on Ghost of Tsushima. 

Keep going guys. We've got this. I never thought I'd be able to do it before because the pull is so powerful. These cravings SUCK. I wish you guys luck!

For example: if I did something like cleaning the kitchen (which I hate), first thought is: phew, good, you're done, now you can have a smoke.

Did laundry? Nice, go have a cigarette. Learned that chapter? Have a smoke.

Now, I don't smoke. And I find it quite hard to reward myself.

I was a smoker for 36 years and had reached a point where I physically thought I couldn‚Äôt go any longer.  I would even go to bed exhausted and wake up feeling the same and the hacking and congestion had reached a point where I felt I was drowning.  I no longer had any motivation or the will to even do things with friends and family.  The worst part of all this was the fact that I had a mild heart attack in May of 2018.  My heart doctor told me then this was a warning sign, yet I totally ignored it and kept smoking.  The doctor noticed this and they stopped calling me to make appointments.  Three weeks ago I was taken out of the office by ambulance as I had what is called a TIA.  Basically, it‚Äôs a blood clot that ran through my brain but fortunately it didn‚Äôt stop or it would have been a stroke or worse I would have died.  One of the attending doctors point blank told me that the next time I would probably die and the toll smoking was taking on me was out of hand and without stopping there wasn‚Äôt any hope for me.  Even though I had smoked for all these years my lungs are clear and my heart has no blockage, which is a blessing they said.  All I had to do was stop smoking and I could have my life back.  Ironically I‚Äôm blessed in all aspects of my life.  I have a great job making good money, a loving and supportive family and a life I never thought was possible when I was young.  Please, everyone who is on the cusp of stopping do so now.  Don‚Äôt be me and hand onto something that only takes and never gives.  I feared quitting for so many years but I guess the thought of dying has made that an easier go for me.  [Today I‚Äôm celebrating 3 weeks smoke free]( https://i.imgur.com/IzAtzxv.jpg) and the results are astounding.  I had forgotten what things smelled like and the true taste of food.  My energy is back, I want to go out and be with friends and family.  Not to mention the extra time I now have to get things done instead of running off all the time to get a fix.

So I dreamt last night that me and my boyfriend were in an apartment I used to live in about 5 years ago but the whole place was falling apart and we were salvaging my old things which were basically garbage.

The side of the building had started bulging outwards and I was thinking how much of a personal relief it was to have gotten out of there before the building collapsed.

My ex from several relationships ago was there too and just mulling around for some reason and we talked briefly.

But here's the problem. I awoke this morning in a state of complete psychological agony.

It's beyond anything I can describe. Like I'm all alone in the world and I wish I was dead. Everything just hurts and every single thought I could possibly have is nothing but a further trigger for something else that's wrong in my life or has been wrong in my life.

There has to be a word for this. This state. But it's awful.

I feel like I'm torn between two options:

1. Killing myself to make it end.

2. Having a cigarette.

I already tried watching TV, meditating, jogging, working out, cooking and I'm now having a hot bath while eating chocolate and drinking vodka.

And I still can't make this stop.

But I just realized my mistake. Yesterday I felt alive and well. I accidentally stopped my strategy of feeling nothing and not caring about myself and others.

Because I allowed myself to feel good...I opened the door to experiencing my own feelings.

And now that I'm feeling horrendous, I'm feeling and directly experiencing myself feeling horrendous.

So I know what to do now, it should have been obvious but I was an idiot.

I'm going to go back to pistol whipping myself any time I feel even moderately good (mentally lol no pistols involved) and remind myself that nothing matters, I don't matter and other people don't matter.

We're all worthless garbage and made out of disgusting materials that are all going to rot in the ground some day but not before the worms and maggots digest us.

I don't know why but now that I'm back to not feeling anything and just being numb the urge to have a cigarette to end my psychological agony has abated.

Of course this drains all the joy out of living as well, but that doesn't matter.

It's better to feel nothing than to be in fucking mental agony

I have been preparing myself mentally for a while. Here is a little bit about me.

* I have been an average of a 1/2 pack a day smoker for the past 7 or so years, on and off, mostly on. This means roughly 10-12 cigs in a waking period. I've had bouts where I've done a pack a day, or 20 cigs in about a 24 hour period.
* I've made countless quitting attempts. Some attempts where I've only made it a few hours. And a handful of attempts where I've gone weeks or months. When my son was born, I quit for over 2 years until his mother and I split, which is what caused me to relapse.
* My two biggest quitting sprees were both cold turkey after just making the decision. I've tried gum and I've never done patches.
* I work as a delivery driver so I am on the road constantly. I drive by gas stations constantly. It's like a porn addict being required to access pornhub as part of his job.
* For the last several months when I am home, I smoke only 1/4-1/2 of a cig at a time. I take 1-3 puffs and then I put it out and save it. I have gotten to the point where I can make a single cigarette stretch out over a 4 or 5 hour period. I did this to take some control back, even if I wasn't quitting just then.

I have made the decision to quit **tonight.** One main reason is that I have my son here until tonight. When I am dealing with nicotine cravings I turn into a miserable bastard. My son is a noise box. Constant talking. Constant gibberish. Constant questions. There is no silence. There is only his running voice box. I just...I can't handle it. I can't deal with the noise AND nicotine cravings. At least not early on. In the first three days, I get headaches, nausea, and my body even starts to make me sick. It is just...terrible what I have let this nicotine do to me. 

So....I have 10 smokes left. I have told myself that I can smoke as many of them or as few of them as I want. Once midnight hits, I am destroying the rest. My son has seen me make a few quitting attempts and then fail at them. He gets so....**defeated**...when I end up going back. I don't want him to get his hopes up again. I want to get through this week and then tell him next Sunday that his daddy quit again and its been a week.

I plan on updating here frequently. I am an author/writer...my career path...so I have tons of poems and essays that I have written about quitting smoking. I will share them in time.

Here's to getting to know you guys. 

And just FYI, you guys are all inspiring me. I was up til 4 am last night after finding this subreddit and I read through SO many pages. So many of you have been 1-2 pack a day smokers for 20+ years. It is SO damn inspiring to read all these success stories. I also love how you welcome smokers who aren't ready to quit yet. You aren't elitist and you aren't judgmental toward people who are still smoking.

I'm 27, have been smoking since I was 15. Since the quarantine I have been home for work, and have the same routines with smoking. I wake up, makes coffee and then have 2 to three cigs. And then I smoke 20 during the day. I almost feel like a can't do a day without this routine.

I'm the last 2 months I have almost been saying to myself every day that I need to stop. I try and relapse within 3 - 4 hours. Next day is the same.

When I did my 3 month no smoke I felt great, I was running and saving money. But I can't even seem to get through 4 hours anymore.

I had chosen the date carefully 02/02/2020. Thought it had a nice ring to it... It was an exceedingly tough day as were many days that followed. Somehow I found the resolve to hang in there with the help of nicotine patches, the Smoke Free app and this community. Now, one year later, I know for sure that I will never ever smoke again. I know I will remain vigilant and ready to resist the very occasional craving / sentimental longing for a cigarette.

I‚Äôm also thinking about the sheer panic I used to feel at the mere thought of quitting. 

I‚Äôm thinking about all the negative impacts of being a life long smoker and how I wish that I‚Äôd found the strength at a younger age to bid farewell to that crutch! But, it is what it is. 

I‚Äôm thinking about how this past year has shown me that even after all those years I‚Äôve regained a level of fitness and health I thought was lost forever - I walk 10km five days a week and do weight training twice a week. I haven‚Äôt felt this good in decades! It is NEVER, NEVER ever too late to quit!

The one thing I‚Äôm MOSTLY thinking about today is the absolute FREEDOM that comes with quitting. No longer that constant obsession, that dread, panic and anxiety I felt in so many circumstances: on discovering I‚Äôm nearly out of smokes, on trying to skulk away at social events to go smoke; on generally planning so many aspects of my daily living around the ability to have a cigarette... actually quite pitiful when you come to think of it. 

So my message today is twofold: 

- Firstly, a huge thank you to all in this community for the inspiration I so often found in the words you wrote, the experiences you shared. I‚Äôm truly grateful!

- Secondly, for those in the early stages of quitting, please just know that cravings do pass and the benefits of freedom from smoking are enormous! You CAN do it! For those in the later stages of quitting, please remain vigilant and ready to beat down any craving/sentimental longing that may threaten you!

If not, the short version is: I am one year smoke free!

When I was 12 I tried my first cigarette. I felt dangerous and cool. I dabbled off and on for a few years, swiping my dad‚Äôs smokes occasionally, until I turned 16 and started smoking with more regularity. I still felt cool. To be clear, I was not, and am not, cool at all. But I felt like smoking made me cooler, and gave me an opportunity to bond with the other smoking kids my age. 

When I went to college I became a pack a day smoker and remained that way for the next 22 years. I figured I would quit one day, but I seriously loved smoking. As I got older I started to see some downsides, mostly social. I didn‚Äôt like being in a group of non smokers because I felt self conscious about smelling. I didn‚Äôt like leaving somewhere fun so I could go outside and smoke. I was an elementary teacher for a while and VERY aware of how I smelled, as well as my clothes, coat, etc. In fact, I was so uncomfortable being a smoker in a non smoking environment I left my teaching job for a boring office job where I didn‚Äôt have to hide my smoking. Even at that point (27 years old) I was in denial about the impact smoking had on my life. 

But I was happy in my new job and got married not long after to my pack a day husband. We were so happy, had a new house and enough money where buying cigarettes wasn‚Äôt a hardship. I still loved smoking more than ever, and noticed my habit had crept up to a pack and a half per day. 

Meanwhile, my father took Chantix and quit after a lifetime of smoking. It worked for him after many failed attempts. It was encouraging to watch because it told me that if he could quit - he liked it as much as me - then I could too when I was ready. 

Fast forward a few years and I am pregnant with my first baby. I immediately quit smoking. Or at least that‚Äôs what I told everyone except my husband. Secretly I was still smoking. Even though it was much less, I was still smoking. I ignored the guilty feelings and delivered a healthy baby nine months later. That happened one more time before the vasectomy. 

By this point, smoking had lost a lot of its allure. I was embarrassed to be standing outside of my car smoking in a parking lot because I couldn‚Äôt wait until I got home. Play dates with new friends were torture because I didn‚Äôt want them to know I smoked. I didn‚Äôt want my kids growing up with two parents that are heavy smokers. I still felt like I enjoyed smoking, but hated being a smoker. I finally started to seriously think about quitting. 

I decided I would quit using Chantix, just like my dad. I made and appointment with a new doctor for a physical, and with the intention of obtaining my prescription. I had to wait four months for the appointment, and let me tell you, I SMOKED ALL DAY AND NIGHT until that day. My anxiety over quitting was awful. I was so so so nervous. I dreaded the withdrawals. I had never once attempted to quit. I struggled to go four hours without a smoke, how was this going to work???

The day of the appointment came, and my doctor wrote me my prescription. She also told me I was obese and my blood work showed that I had high cholesterol and was a tiptoe away from being at risk for type two diabetes. Not a fun appointment. 

So I set my quit date for February 1, which was 2 weeks away. I got my medicine, a giant bag of life savers and Allen Carr‚Äôs book. I was a total wreck and smoking constantly. 

Now, a lot of people said that the first week of taking the medicine (before the actual quit date) decreased their cravings. These people are not me. I felt zero difference in my wanting to smoke. February 1, 2020 was a Saturday, and I smoked right up till bed time the night before.

THEN CAME THE BIG DAY. I told everyone I knew I was quitting. I had agonized over this for months. I took the medicine exactly as prescribed. I gathered some big puzzles to keep myself occupied. I very nearly lost my resolve an hour into my day. After all, I had smoked a cigarette as soon as I woke up every morning for at least 20 years. I knew it was going to be hard, but the entire first day was horrifyingly bad. I ate the entire day. I was cranky. I took three showers. BUT. I did not smoke. 

I woke up the next day in awe that I had made it an entire day, in my home, around all my triggers and still smoking husband, without smoking. That feeling helped me through day two, which was only marginally better. 

As it turns out, the first three days were the very worst, which I had heard. However the next three months were almost as hard. Somewhere around six weeks I was desperate. I had gained about 20 pounds. We were on lockdown due to COVID. I wanted to smoke more than ever. WHY????? I was so pissed off this was still so hard. I talked to my dad and sister constantly for support. I yelled at my husband all the time (who was great and took it like a champ). I. Was. Fucking. Miserable. And I was unimpressed with the Chantix so I stopped taking it. 

One day in early May, my three year old ran off towards the street. I had to sprint down the driveway to get her, picked her up and ran back to the backyard. I suddenly realized that, despite being a giant fatass that had not willingly exercised in years, I was not out of breath. Three months earlier, that 30 foot jog would have definitely had me huffing and puffing. The next day I loaded the kids into the double stroller and took a ‚Äúlong‚Äù walk. In retrospect, it was less than a half mile, but it was a brisk walk and it felt AMAZING. I finally understood. I turned the corner! The benefits of quitting smoking finally caught up to me!! I spent the next month working up to 10,000 steps per day. Then two more months of daily walks with some light jogging. I couldn‚Äôt believe how good I felt. After that I started a couch to 5k program and started biking as well. I cut out nighttime eating and soda. As the running continued I cut out most processed food and added sugar. In total I lost 70 pounds. 

Two weeks ago I went back to the doctor for my annual physical and she was so proud of my accomplishments. I‚Äôm no longer obese. I got my cholesterol down to almost normal. All my other blood work was perfect. And most importantly, I successfully quit smoking. 

I vividly remember the despair I felt leading up to and in those first months of quitting. It was so awful but so worth it. Quitting smoking changed my whole life. I‚Äôm healthy, happy, way better at dealing with stress, and a much better parent. 

If you are trying to quit or struggling, good for you! Keep it up! Stay the course. It may not feel like it, but it will get better. I don‚Äôt miss smoking at all and will never smoke again.

So far I‚Äôve:
- bought small things (not sustainable)
- ordered my fav foods for takeout (also not sustainable)

- played my fav songs (wears off after the first 10 times on repeat)

I am writing this post to share my story with you and show you that if I can, you can as well!

Here‚Äôs my backstory. I‚Äôm a 24 year old girl, who LOVED to smoke. I smoked my first cigarette at 16 at a friend‚Äôs birthday party. After then I became what most people call ‚Äúa social smoker‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt smoke at home or when I was on my own, but whenever there was some type of gathering I enjoyed a cigarette or two. However, I never went past 5-6 a day. This continued until I was 19 and moved abroad for university. I don‚Äôt know how, I just stopped. 

However, shortly after that I was put on anxiety medication, which I took for 1.5 years. Combined with therapy I managed to fix my anxiety issues, so my doctor said it was time to taper off the medication. I started reading on the internet (huge mistake) and I scared myself nuts that I was going to suffer some sort of terrible withdrawals. 

Guess what I did? I was stupid enough to say to myself ‚Äúmaybe cigarettes will help to keep me calm‚Äù (huge mistake number 2). I started with 5-6 a day and before I knew I was already smoking 1 pack a day. I loved to smoke and I could never ever imagine myself as a non-smoker again. I was ignoring the coughing, the burned clothes, the terrible disgusting smell in my hair. I thought ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not addicted, I just love to smoke. They make me calm‚Äù. 

I attempted stopping once, but I did it more because of my mother, who was nagging all the time about my smoking. Of course, I didn‚Äôt succeed. Survived about 3 weeks, felt miserable all the time and eventually went back to smoking. I was so disappointed in myself, but at the same time relieved.

The turning point for me was when me and my fianc√© (also a smoker) started talking about having kids. I remember so clearly, it was a cold night a few months ago. My fianc√© fell asleep and I went on the balcony for a smoke. I ended up chain smoking three cigarettes, even though I couldn‚Äôt feel my frozen hands. Then I thought ‚Äúwhat the f am I doing? What type of a mother am I going to be? What I am going to do, stop for 9 months and after I give birth start smoking again? What the hell makes me think it‚Äôs okay to smoke around a baby and then hug it, smelling like nasty ashtray‚Äù. 
I started crying, thinking how terrible of an example I will set for my future kids. I knew I had to do something.

Next day I spoke to my doctor for a possible solution and she recommended to me the book ‚ÄúThe easy way to stop smoking‚Äù by Allen Carr. I said to her ‚Äúno, you don‚Äôt understand, I LOVE to smoke, a book simply won‚Äôt help!‚Äù. She was like ‚Äújust try, if it doesn‚Äôt work I will put you on a pill‚Äù. 
I started the book with the mindset that it‚Äôs a bunch of bullshit and had absolutely no faith that it will help even slightly but though ‚Äúokay, I‚Äôll just read it and when it doesn‚Äôt work I‚Äôll go back to my doctor for pills‚Äù. I expected a bunch of statistics about how it damages the health and how expensive it is. I knew all of that and I still was smoking. 

I can‚Äôt explain my shock when in one of the first chapters my illusion that cigarettes calm me down was shattered to pieces. I remember leaving the book down and running to my fianc√©: ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt calm me down, they make me more tense!‚Äù

My fianc√© ended up reading the book with me and after realising all of the points he decided to quit as well. After finishing the book I just felt like I would be the biggest moron in the world if I continue smoking knowing all of that. Basically all the reasons I made up to justify my smoking were shattered. I was not only wanting to quit, I felt genuinely disgusted that I let myself fall for that trap. I felt pathetic for being a smoker.

Note: reading the book was not all I did. I read the book and than wrote down WHY I want to stop. I truly BELIEVED every single reason I stated. You need to find YOUR reasons and set your mind straight.

Aftermath: I quitted cold turkey. No withdrawal symptoms, no desire to smoke. It was ridiculously easy! I felt a huge relief when I realised I don‚Äôt have to poison my body anymore. The only times I was thinking about a cigarette (not craving, just thinking about it) was after a meal. But even that disappeared quickly. 
Edit: the only physical symptom I felt was coughing. I guess it was my lungs clearing up from the filth.

Something I forgot to mention: the huge relief. 
The first morning I woke up smoke free I realised that I no longer feel like my throat is full of thorns. No more coughing, no more burned clothes, no more ash everywhere, no more shame, no more hiding from my parents so they think I smoke less than I actually do, no more trying to find a way to go out for a smoke at every occasion, no more fear that I may get pregnant and unknowingly poison my baby before I find out and feel guilty for the rest of my life. 
I felt truly free.

My point is that if I did it you can do it as well. You just need to have a good reason to stop and wholeheartedly believe in it. The scary withdrawal you read about everywhere is 98% psychological. If you eliminate the psychological factor and set your mind straight, the physical side of it is so mild, that you won‚Äôt even feel it.",47,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9896547794342041}"

The first 3 days were the hardest, I was grumpy and had to really focus on why I was doing it. Still have to do that. Like I have this inner parent telling my inner child to not touch the fire, making me wanting it even more, if that makes sense to anyone. Also I started to cough and having to clear my throat, which was not a problem during smoking. 

But there are also good things happening. Every day I notice I can breath more, smell more, I can open my eyes easier in the morning, I have less of a dry nose, I have more motivation to do my daily things. Also have more energy from not being occupied with planning to smoke and higher quality sleep. 

I try to be super aware of how I was thinking before and notice how this addiction is really taking control of your thoughts. Trying to accept / understand it is the smoking talking, not me. I am amazed that a molecule is capable of this amount of brain-washing.

There was a time where I was convinced that this moment will NEVER come. That I can't live without smoking like a chimney. That I am meant to stay a smoker, because being without it seemed impossible. Thank god it was just the nicotine addiction talking!
I used to believe that smoking enchanted my life and made it better, now I see how ridiculous that belief was! My life is enchanted and a thousand times better NOW, because I am no longer an addict. 
Being a smoker was like having a constant storm and fight in myself, now it is finally quiet and I can truly enjoy every moment.

My bf has tobacco lying around occasionally, because he likes to smoke it with weed. Yesterday, after a long time, I took a look at tobacco and sniffed it. Just to see if it would stir anything in me. Honestly, it smelled vile. I was horrified and amazed that I had been a slave for YEARS to a bunch of dried leaves. I finally saw tobacco for what it truly is: NOTHING. When you're a smoker the nicotine in it convinces you it is everything when reality couldn't be further from it. I can't honestly put into words the joy you can feel when you realize that nicotine no longer has power over you.

If you're trying to quit, then keep trying! I quit for literally hundreds of times. And then failed. And then quit again and again and again until it finally stuck. And now I could not be happier that this dark cloud that was looming over my life and seeped into every moment, is GONE! For good!!!
Honestly, if I could do it then literally anyone can! But be gentle with yourself if it takes time. It took me literally years. You will get there, just like I did!

Edit: Forgot to add that I have no cravings whatsoever. I do have moments where I suddenly get hit with a strong memory. For instance, I'll randomly remember how nice it was to sit down outside with a coffee and a cigarette on a spring morning and 'enjoy' both. And yes at the time it did seem nice and it's a lovely memory. But thats all it is for me and it doesn't make me want to smoke now.",40,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9872424602508545}"
