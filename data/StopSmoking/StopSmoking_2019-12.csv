I followed through with it and had some of the worst anxiety and weirdest dreams in a long time but I felt better and more rested each day. My sleep really wasn‚Äôt all that refreshing for ages!

Today though I gave in and smoked again. I think 3 or 4. Mostly because I am bored as one can be. I think a lot of cigarettes were smoked because I was bored and just don‚Äôt know what to do with my time. I know it doesn‚Äôt cure boredom but in that moment it seems like an easy fix...

I don‚Äôt think writing this does serve any purpose besides me reflecting about what I went through the first two days and think about how much better I felt without smoking to not forget it. Somehow my brain just ignores/forgets that after a short time...

Anyway, thanks to each and everyone of you sharing your experiences and all the  motivation to keep going! This is an awesome community!

I‚Äôm not really mad I smoked today, can‚Äôt change it now, I‚Äôm happy I did not smoke 30 cigarettes over the last few days and I‚Äôll give my damn best to not smoke tomorrow!

I didnt like how often I smoked, but in all honesty, I do miss the feel of taking a long drag outside more than anything else with smoking.

 i started swooping on my moms cigs at about 14-15 maybe? at first it was taking a couple puffs to get the head rush; i‚Äôd grab it out of her purse when she fell asleep and spark up on the back deck. id take like a couple puffs, get the head rush, feel sick, put it out, throw up lol, why couldn‚Äôt have i stopped there? don‚Äôt we all ask ourselves this. 

 eventually, in high school, i had a buddy who‚Äôs house was like the party, ‚Äòdowhateverthefuckyouwant‚Äô house. it was honestly some of the best times i had at that house. good and bad, honestly. it was a single story, 3-bedroom, with a huge living room and even bigger backyard, that had a (old and kinda rickety) deck. our main adobe was the garage, oh the garage. tons of old movie, music, and sports memorabilia on the walls and ceilings from all throughout the 70s-90s (we‚Äôd also put pictures of the squad up on there too, just anything that was cool), and a fucking pool table. you already KNOW the shit that‚Äôs gone down in that room if it‚Äôs got a fuckin‚Äô pool table. period. we‚Äôd host tons of ‚Äòkickbacks‚Äô (smaller parties) and sometimes larger parties and just get completely obliterated. we‚Äôd do coke, smoke cigarettes, alllllways smoking weed, drinking whatever we had (we had buddies who were 21, even as freshmen and sophomores) and just having a good ass time. keep in mind the coke (and heroin) came later in my life. 

 i could begin my addiction to cigarettes here i guess. there was an ENDLESS supply of cigarettes. his pops would always have a pack in this tin bowl on the top of the fridge, and we‚Äôd pretty much just help ourselves unless it was his last smoke. his mom knew, but she didn‚Äôt care, she‚Äôd give us packs and shit. she also would buy us tons of booze (we didn‚Äôt pay for it all the time, depending on how loaded she was, which was cool) and she‚Äôd order pizza on a whim. 
 we‚Äôd all sit in the big living room and watch Jeopardy as a weird family. BTW his dad had framed, autographed sports jerseys all over the walls in there. Micheal Jordan, Wayne Gretzky, Kobe, and a couple baseball players. my squad was pretty much just a bunch of misfits and my buddy‚Äôs place was the only place that felt like our actual home. like literally, if you needed a place to stay you could hop the fence if the door was locked and crash on the couch in the garage. usually the door wasn‚Äôt locked, so you could just walk in and crash on a couch in the living room. it was a great atmosphere. 

 i will say that his mom was a very, very, very severe alcoholic. but don‚Äôt get me wrong about Candy though (her ‚Äòname‚Äô), she was a good mother from what i saw. always had tons of food in the fridge, super nice and invitational in her home. she was about 45-55, had money (due to her and her husbands fruitful careers) and owned a nice home in Northern CA. unfortunately, the reason the house was kind of a free-lance type of thing is because there wasn‚Äôt a lot of order. My buddy‚Äôs dad had huntington‚Äôs disease, so he was either always asleep in his room or really wasn‚Äôt aware of what was going on in the house. 

my friendship with this kid was unbreakable at first. but as we grew older, our experimentation and eventual crippling addiction to heroin would tear us apart. we‚Äôre both clean today, but still don‚Äôt really talk as much as we used to. 

addictions, addictions! little story for you guys. sorry if it was off topic, foreal. but look, i actually need some help quitting smoking. i no longer smoke cigarettes, and moved onto vaping. i smoke 50mg salt nicotine using a Breeze 2 vape. everybody tells me to just lower the percentage but the next level down is 35mg! like that‚Äôs a 15mg drop! won‚Äôt that be significant? thanks guys.

And usually that pack would just sit around for a couple months. I'd have a smoke with friends, after a long or bad day, or if I just wanted a nic buzz. Whatever, not good, but also not terrible. 

Then, august 24th, a good friend of mine committed suicide. And in November one of my great uncles died, along with someone I went to high school with. I smoked a bit more. Then December 10th, my grandma died. It's been a rough few months. 

But now I'm up to 2 or 3 packs a week. I dont really even get a nic buzz anymore, it's just a crutch I dont want or need. 
Yesterday was rough, and one of my roommates talked to me about how he's worried about me/my smoking. This was right after I was chain smoking. 

It's weird, I want to quit smoking, but there are aspects of it I enjoy. Stepping outside and almost being forced to stop and think. Or just enjoy nature for a few minutes. It has helped a little bit, but I want to quit. 

I can do it, and I want to quit before I get any deeper in. But, well, it's not easy. Between the easy access to them, and having a number of friends who smoke.

There were certainly times when I wanted to. The urge to smoke hasn't died entirely -- but, for the most part, it has died. 

Every now and then when drinking... I will have the sudden urge. But it passes quickly and I move on. 

A number of my coworkers smoke, but I am never tempted to step out back with them. They always smell like shit after smoking - hard to believe I smelled that way for nearly 10 years! 

Moral of the story: if an insufferable addict like I was can kick nicotine, you certainly fucking can. 

I have been thinking a lot about cigarettes this week, as the change in age from 18 to 21 went into effect....

A lot of folks I know, on BOTH sides of the political spectrum, have complained about this change in policy --- but I really fucking support it. 

If the smoking age had been 21 when I was 18, there's a really good chance I never would have become addicted to cigarettes in the first place. 

Yeah, those who are bound and determined to smoke will always find a way -- but there's a chance that I would have given up trying before the cancer sticks had me firmly by the balls.

Nicotine is a drug probably most of u are aware of this. It releases feel good chemiclas which alter your mood. It might be  a slight change but its still there.

I Have an addictive personality no cap. And I have the feeling it might not be the nicotine itself but the ""On command lets alter my mood slightly"" that im missing.
I had problem with gambling or weed in the past but they werent that serious as this. Those have been in control mostly and getting off of them was a breeze.

I cant replace this habbit at all. Idk what to do now. I feel worse each day. I crave harder and harder now.

I want to alter my mood so bad and I hate it. I dont want other chemicals in my life.

I work in a restaurant and was having a lot anxiety before my shift today because I thought it would be much more difficult than how it had previously been with me just being home all day. So to try and help with my anxiety I took a few shots of Jameson before my shift. (I think this was a mistake)

Throughout my shift my cravings were so bad it was at times difficult for me to concentrate on my job. I was incredibly close to asking a coworker for a cigarette. I was reconsidering not using nicotine substitutes if this is what it would be like. (Allen Carrs method doesnt want you to use nicotine substitutes). 

Anyways I guess I just wanted to vent about it because I dont have many people I can talk to about this whole experience and I think it might help.

 I also want to ask if anyone had any advice for staying strong in a fast paced, stressful work environment like a restaurant? And I'm also looking for advice on how to stay strong when I'm drinking? Should I just not drink at all?

I figured that some others may be going through this, what with Christmas being an absolute cluster for many of us out there. Until Friday I had been two and a half months smoke free (cold turkey, previously 20 a day for 15 years). This is just a very long, rambling moan and vent as I'm feeling very antsy and a bit melancholic.

I came back to my home country to see family for Christmas. My family situation is pretty tricky to say the least. I love my life and feel pretty good when I'm in my own domain, but my family, thanks to a ton of unpleasant personalities, health problems, guilt, and just generally being very very intense, always made me really cherish that 5 minutes of being able to go outside and have some time to myself.

My brother-in-law is the only other person who smokes, and within two hours I'd caved and asked him for a cigarette. Then over the week I asked for more and more, then I bought him a pouch of tobacco to say sorry for having so many. Over the past two days I've probably had 10 per day. This has coincided with the most stressful people in my family being around, and I wanted to escape more and more. That, plus cigarettes are sneaky, addictive bastards.

What have I learned? Well I already knew it but cigarettes make me anxious as fuuuuck. Like constant flight or flight dread kind of anxious. My heart is beating faster, I'm edgy, I'm restless, but also strangely out of it and exhausted. I can't taste of smell glorious things already, plus I have to deal with the guilt of fucking up a very good run.

Tomorrow I'm going to another city to see friends, - none of them smoke, and all of them are great people. I can't wait, and I'm also thinking (repeating to myself) that I can't wait to not smoke again. If you've made it this far, thanks very much for reading.

Started with 14mg patches, since I wasn‚Äôt a conventional smoker. Day 2 and 3 were very tough. Powered through and started feeling really good until last Wednesday, day 16.

Is it possible to start having withdrawal symptoms after having been on the patches and relatively stable for over two weeks? Is this typical with the patches?

Smoking is goofy as I smoked a pack a day from 18-22 and then just quite one day.   Then it became something I would do when drunk in my mid 30s.   Then at 40 I decided the booze had to stop, but the smoking stayed on.   I would quit for 1-2 weeks at a time, which, given my pattern, basically meant I would do one work trip without grabbing a pack.   But then I‚Äôd go back on the next trip.   

So, here, with 40 days and probably 5 work trips under my belt, I think I‚Äôm over the hump of ‚Äúok, I really mean it.‚Äù

I smoked for 19 years. I really enjoyed it. I thought that I would never be able to quit because I was weak willed and work a stressful job. Others that were stronger than me could do it but couldn't see myself doing it.

I got the Alan Carr audiobook with a free trial of Audible through Amazon.

This is the first time I have made a quit attempt for myself only and not because my family or a friend wanted me to, or pressured me into it. The longest I had made it was a few days previously.

My decision to quit was sudden, I didn't plan it days or weeks in advance as I had tried in the past. I didn't dwell on it mentally which I feel made it easier as I hadn't built it up into a big deal in my head.

First step was pushing through the first 3-4 days. I don't have a lot of advice on this part except to stay busy and when it was just too much, I went to sleep.

I found that after the first few weeks when the nicotine withdrawal was gone to be the toughest part. The urge to smoke a cigarette was replaced with a void or an empty, depressed sort of feeling. This hounds me a bit still now but is much more manageable. I hadn't heard much about this part of journey and was surprised when it came up so I mention it because if you run into it in on your journey, it's only temporary!

I refused to avoid triggers or change my routine. The reason being that I never intended on quitting coffee or quitting driving to work or quitting eating good meals so why avoid them as an ex smoker? You are going to run into these situations at some point and will have to replace the smoking with something else. Why not do this from the start?

I started exercising a month before I quit. I found that the endorphin rush created by physical activity is stronger than smoking and lasts much, much longer. Morning exercise got me close to noon each day with cravings reduced if not eliminated. The effect is twofold as it reduces the urge and gives you a reason not to feed the urge to smoke (why would you follow up a run with a smoke?) I had to stop exercising 4 weeks ago after a minor surgery and things were much tougher for the weeks where I was completely inactive. Hopefully I can start to slowly get back into the daily exercise routine in the next few days as it has helped more than any other single factor.

The other information that I found useful was that it takes approx. 3 months for your brain's chemistry to return to ""normal"" after quitting. Feeling strange, angry, depressed, confused etc. is all part of the process. I am still feeling some of these feelings now  but it is getting easier everyday.  Weeks 2 to 5 were quite a mental journey. 

It has only been two months but I can't see a situation arising where I will smoke again. I have regained too much and battled too hard to get here to let myself have to go through it again.

I am so happy to have rid myself of such a terrible addiction. It is a battle, but it is so worth it.

Best decision ever.,"After continuously smoking non stop since I was 17, I got to the point where the coughing was so bad I thought that that was it. Heavy coughing, chest pain, stomach burns and shifting temperatures like a fever. 
Went to the doctor and hoped for the flu or other infection. But nothing. This was caused alone by smoking. 
I stopped over night. All my excuses was gone. 
One day, two days, one week and now one month. I never thought I would be able to do it.

The coughing is almost gone, much better breathing and my family is so happy and supportive. I feel so much better. 
I still have some stomach burns, but they are all related to me eating too much. Compensation for sure. Gained around 4 kg. But it is getting under control and I will start work out after Christmas. 

I found that my smoking was driven by idleness and I still get the cravings every time I stop doing something. But besides that, as long as I have something to do I am fine.

There is no guarantee but I am sure that this stop is for good. I keep reminding myself of how lucky I am and that I should do everything in my power to enjoy it for as long as possible. This is the best present I could give myself and my loved ones.

I wish all of you a Merry Christmas/Holiday. I hope you will get the same great gift that I got.",187,{'infect': 1},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.83931094}"

I must confess im not the must tech savvy. Being on reddit or using any other social platforms is though for me. And not just because english isnt my first language. This platform is simply not intuitive for me...

Being a smoker for over 10 years, i stumbled across this platform, directly onto this subreddit and read a post about Alan's Carr easy way of quitting method.
I got the book and tried to quit (again). This time i kept lurking this subreddit and r/cigarrets. These are the only subreddits im subscribed to (Must face my fears, right?).

Im today 4 months smoke free, although i still thing about smoking sometimes (which is perfectly manageable).
Simply put, Im not a smoker anymore. And that's a lot. Coming from me.

To sum up my journey, I saw somewhere in here, what became my experience: the rule of the 3s. 3 days of hell, 3 weeks to break the habit, 3 months to clear the mind. It was. Like clockwork. 
And not another- not a fucking single -puff. Ever.

And let me tell you a little detail. 
My brother (1 year older) and I started this journey together. He had been smoking the same amount of cigs for roughly the same time. About 3 months in, he was confident he could smoke just one cigarette. It had been difficult, but he thought he was off the hook. He wasn't. He is smoking yet again, but promised to try quitting this new years Eve. 

I know now that i cannot be a social smoker. 
Sometimes to bear the pain is just the lesser evil. 


God knows how thankful i am. To you all. 
It is only the beginning of my journey. It might not be a linear one, but sure I'll try.

2019-12-21 11:59:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/eds9a5/finally_got_patches/,Finally got patches,"Kind of just a rant going in a directions and no proof reading, but I guess that's the point of this sub, just want to lay down my thoughts. Took up about 8-9 years ago, been an actual smoker for at least 7 (am 25). Today I've done something I wanted to do for a long time, went to the doc to treat something I should've treated *months* ago and asked for patches while I was at it. It's so easy to do it (in Canada at least), and yet somehow so hard to make the phone call. I actually called a clinic three months ago, she said I need to speak with an inhalotherapist so she transferred me and I hit the voicemail, I just hung up and didn't call back. 

For whatever reason I've never smoked in from of my family, despite them obviously knowing I'm a smoker, I'm just not comfortable with it. I had managed to quit cold turkey early 2017 during a trip with my dad and then it lasted for 3-4 months, until I got drunk once (barely ever do) and thought ""hey that's nice I can be an occasional smoker, best of both worlds!"" Well that was a lie and I bought a pack a week later after poaching my housemates. Addiction is a weird thing, when I was 3 weeks in I actually got into a non-smoker's mindset, it actually smelled disgusting again and I had no trouble (give or take) not picking it up, I knew I felt better without it and also felt more attractive which is nice. So this time I know I just have to last 3 weeks and I'll be on a roll. Since I'll be at my parents' two weeks for the holidays (different city), it seems like a good occasion to give it another go, and I don't want to have a shit mood for these two weeks. I've noticed lately that when I was spending my weekends there, I was getting irritable by the end and leaving earlier than I wanted just to light up on the road, and that's depressing, I love them and don't like the lack of tobacco not letting me be who I am with them. Hopefully this time it will work, I have a good feeling given what I've learned from my last experience and with a replacement to help me through the beginning which is inarguably the hardest, in my experience at least, you just have to realize from there that you will *always* be a smoker in your head and taking just a puff is a very slippery slope, we're no better from drug addicts on that regard, aside from the fact it's not making us junkies. Would love to get this habit out of the way and I think patches will help me get the ball rolling. At the same time ease of access seems to be an issue for me as is obvious with weed, I spent the most of last year without that habbit except for a handful of times. Thing is, I lived in buttfuck no where so I had to drive an hour and half to buy it (Canadian), since I got back in civilization I've unfortunately started consuming more and more, right back to smoking every evening until the other day and it is painfully obvious it has objectively a detrimental effect in my mood. I've sweated it out now and don't feel the urge to get high. I guess I mean to say I'll have to abstain from following smokers outside for quite some time, not that I'm seeing anyone anyways.

Next step will be getting a psychologist appointment for my other issues and get back in shape, maybe getting rid of tobacco will be the stepping stone to get there, at least for the latter. Maybe it's too much to tackle all of my problems at once but I gotta get my shit together, I feel miserable despite having a good life on the surface (good job with my college degree, a lovely family and even a baby nephew now!), here's to getting better. Enjoy your holidays with your close ones folks, cherish what you have and be strong if you're on the path of getting rid of nicotine or other problems, may 2020 be the start of something better.",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.41297632}"

I know a lot of people are probably coming up on their quit date at the end of this month. I was with my dad 3.5 months ago when he was told that they found a large mass in his lung. The way my heart dropped, they way my younger brother started sobbing and the shock and fear on my stepmom's face. The regret that was plain on my dad's face. He smoked a pack a day for 40 years. And the time had come - he was not one of the lucky ones who smoked his whole life and lived to be 80. That regret scared the shit out of me. It disgusted me that after leaving the ER that night, all I wanted to do was smoke cigarette. 

I had a wedding to attend the following day, I got drunk and smoked so many cigarettes. And then that was it. I have not smoked since the day after finding out about my dad. There were plenty of times I wanted one and plenty of time I could have justified it.

I wanted one when they told us his life expectancy.

I wanted one on the way to his brain radiation.

I wanted one when he was admitted into the hospital for uncontrollable pain.

I want one when I think  about all the things he's going to miss and how much I'm going to miss him.

But living is better than cigarettes. My heart breaks for all the people suffering from cancer. It doesn't make it any less heart breaking when you have no one to blame but yourself. I don't want to be in the position my dad is in. I don't want to think I should have quit all those years ago when I made so many excuses to keep smoking. I remember my dad trying to quit, a sucker in his mouth as he was driving us to grade school. Where would we be now if he stuck with it that time?

I don't want to feel that way when my time comes. I want to be old and happy and ready to go and I'm going to do everything in my power to have it be so. I want the same for everyone in this community. So I share this really personal stuff in hopes that it helps others. Happy Holidays & thank you for all the support.

Started at 24, I go to the gym every day, super low BF, eat right, 6 pack all that shit. I've had asthma since i was 17 (sports induced).

Never even bought a pack in my life. I'd have 5-10 cigarettes a week, bum em off people or buy them, sometimes $5 for one cig because i was too ashamed to buy a pack. Not a lot right? Not the way I took it. I'd break up the cigarette in 5 pieces. Pack half a bong bowl with weed and the other half with the cig tobacco. No filter.

I'd rip it the whole bowl in 1 shot. I'd have about 10 seconds to find a place to sit or lie down because soon my vision would be blurred and my muscles wouldn't be able to hold up my body weight. The room would spin, I'd feel like i was being pulled from my body, and I'd lay there and drool on myself for 3-5 minutes.

Lay there sad after the buzz wore off, thinking about all the people with COPD and my family members who have had cancer.

I did this about 3-5x a day for 5 years.

In those 5 years for the first time in my life I had to use my inhaler, about 6-10x a day. I was also placed on symbicort.

I'd have bronchitis once a month, constantly coughing or have sore throats. I hated it. But I loved it.

Then one day April 19th of this year I had an LSD trip and I lit up a cig to calm down because I was so freaked out (in a good way, it was my first time).

I thought to myself ""this is the grossest thing I have ever put in my mouth""

Right then and there I quit smoking tobacco. Didn't miss it one bit. But my buddies used Juuls. I hit it. It didn't give me what the cig in the bong would give me, but it did give me a small head rush. I convinced myself ""this is healthier, I'm doing great""

So instead of sore throats every month or coughing fits, my chest and throat would tighten up, get swollen, almost feel shut. This is every day. Can barely make it up stairs without my inhaler.

Still using my inhaler 6-10x a day and the symbicort.

2.5 weeks ago have the worst bronchitis of my life. Think of those 8oz coffee cups at offices. Filling those to the top with lung butter, butterscotch pudding of the human body, every day for 8 days. 

Have a complete mental breakdown.

Take my juul and my gf's juul to the garage. She get's upset. I tell her she can live with the juul or live with me. It's killing me. I hate myself.

I put both juul's on the ground in my garage. Went to my basement and got a 100lb dumb bell.

Held it high over my head and fucking smashed both of the juuls.

It's been 2 weeks.

Haven't used my inhaler. Haven't used my symbicort. I can go up stairs again.

Waking up this morning i hit my snooze like 5 times because I did not want to put myself in a difficult position of not smoking while dealing w an obstinate, egotistical, know-it-all employee.  
Basically, I just pretended like I didn‚Äôt care while working w him.

A day that he squeaks about taking 11 hours for him was done in 6.5 hours- almost half the time it takes him.  At the end of the day I was a little worked up that he plays coy about pretty much everything I trained him on (for about the tenth time).  I looked at him and said ‚Äúit looks like your Thursday‚Äôs are more than manageable- do you agree?‚Äù  Of course he says ‚Äúoh, yeah, Thursday‚Äôs are not the problem- it‚Äôs Wednesday‚Äôs‚Äù.  I brought up every text and email about Thursday‚Äôs being unbearable and he basically stuttered a ‚Äúyeah, but Wednesday gets bogged down which rolls in to Thursday‚Äù- blah blah blah.   The guy got called on his bs and now I, he, our bosses all know that Thursday‚Äôs are not a problem, and he‚Äôs full of shit.  Now, after the holidays I am going to work with him on a Wednesday and run circles around him again- we‚Äôll see what his excuses is then.

2019-12-19 12:33:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/ecwfyg/extreme_fatigue_for_weeksmonths/,Extreme fatigue for weeks...months...?,"Hi!

I would greatly appreciate some advice/perspectives. I smoked for about 3-4 years (between 10-20/day), then switched to vaping for about another 3 years. In the last year I've pretty much been a chain vaper, the thing never left my hand.  


At the beginning of November I just decided I'd had enough and wanted to quit. Cold turkey. The first couple of days weren't too bad, then the debilitating fatigue hit me and I just needed to spend practically whole days in bed. Then the waves of debilitating sadness/depression and existential angst came (which I found really hard to deal with as I'm usually the happiest guy I know). There's been the occasional day where, for no discernible reason at all, everything I could think of possibly doing now or in the future was utterly boring, life was pointless, and everything felt completely flat. Never experienced anything like that before.

Then the next day it would pass and I'd feel perfectly happy again. But maybe exhausted. I'd say my mood now is very fragile and prone to big swings for no obvious reason, whereas my mood has always been very stable and pretty happy before.

It's been just over six weeks, and another wave of massive fatigue has come crashing back over me. There've been times when I've felt nearly better, but not quite. I did have a sinus/ear infection but that's gone now.

I run a couple of businesses from home and I'm used to being able to work from 10am-midnight with only 2-3 hours' break in the middle, multiple days a week, and be focused and productive for most of that time. Then go to sleep between 12-2am and get up at 8-9 to do it all again the next day.

Now? Many days I struggle to put in 4-5 hours of actual work, and working into the evening? Forget it. I'm just so tired. All damn day. Heavy legs, heavy head, struggle to focus. But I'm getting MORE sleep than I was before - a lot more.

I feel much better when I go out for a walk or have you...it helps mask the fatigue, but as soon as I get home and sit down in front of my desk again...bleurgh.

If it doesn't clear up by new years I'm strongly considering picking up vaping again, even though the cravings have been gone for at least 2-3 weeks and I never even think about it anymore. I've lost nearly two months of productivity to this and I can't deal with it any more. Plus the longer it goes on, the longer I worry it's got nothing to do with the vaping and something else is going on.

So...that's a long way of asking - is this normal? Will it pass? Should I be concerned?",2,"{'infect': 1, 'mask': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.38688943}"

I was nervous because smoking had kind of always been a part of our relationship - our patterns and habits and routines involved it (probably were based around it if I‚Äôm being honest) and I wasn‚Äôt convinced he really wanted to quit.

Fast forward a few days and he‚Äôs picking something up from the gas station and I automatically think of our other gas station runs in the past for beer and cigs. So I asked him, ‚Äújust beer, right?‚Äù  And he replies ‚ÄúJust beer. I‚Äôm not a smoker.‚Äù

And I said to him why don't you move to costa rica because there's a lot of job opportunities rather then north Korea where you're probably going to jail or something. He moved to costa rica knowing the laws of smoking. Now sometimes I visit him there and there allow tourists to smoke in locations locals cannot. He got mad about this towards me and told me I should not smoke in front of him. I said sorry and okay. and now he decided to ban me from even coming to see him for three months because he has decided to quit.

Very happy to have escaped the grasp of the nicotine monster that had been bossing me around. Now I‚Äôm in charge!

Here are some things that worked for me:

- Replaced smoke breaks with eating an apple. Found that I felt like smoking less after eating apples because it kinda dries your mouth out

- Walked up and down some stairs at work every time I felt an intense craving. Also repeated the mantra ‚ÄúNot a single drag, no matter what!‚Äù

- Swapped coffee for tea in the first week

- Had a stress ball with my mantra written on it. I would squeeze it to keep my hands busy when I craved

- Doing the dishes immediately after each meal

- Telling friends and family that I‚Äôve quit smoking (This was a big one for me as it solidified my decision to quit. You will find it harder to succeed if you try to quit in secret!)

- Reading a chapter a day of Allen Carr‚Äôs book ‚ÄúEasy Way to Stop Smoking‚Äù

He has smoked his entire life, probably since he was 14. So far, no major health issues - that I am aware of. He has the horrible cough, thats terrible in the morning. Hes short of breath if he has to get his heart rate up, but other than that he gets regular doctor checkups and so far nothing serious (cancer, etc) has been detected.  I've asked him before to please stop smoking, I've purchased nicotine gum, I've lightly talked to him about it several times but this new year I am planning full push for him to stop. I have a brother with a baby on the way and I plan to start a family with my husband in the next 1-2  years. I need my dad healthy. He is my best friend and my world. I cant stand to see him low energy, and at only 60yrs I feel that if he stopped smoking he could have such a full and meaningful life, for longer. 

My issues is that my father lives alone. He has not remarried after my parents divorce, doesnt even have a girlfriend. He has an active job on his feet 5 days a week (part time hours) so he does get out & about otherwise not very social or active outside of work. He just doesn't have anyone there monitoring him and as a constant support system. I am ready to dedicate the time necessary to help in on this journey, I just dont know where to start. I have looked up multiple free programs where we live, and I plan on encouraging him to enroll.

How do I keep him on track without nagging him no being present all the time? I know he wants to quit but I know he is deathly scared to. I am afraid that I will get too emotional when confronting him, I have tears building as I write this thinking about him. Does anyone have advice on how you got a loved one to quit, specifically a loved one you don't live with? I was hoping for programs we could attend together. Any and all advice, resources is appreciated. I love my father with all my heart and I am desperate to give him back the life that he deserves - smoke free.",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5047471}"

This isn't the first time I quit; I tried a thousand times, but by far this is the longest streak I managed to get to, so far. The first 20 days were really hard, but it's been a long time since I've had a craving; I have to check the app to remember that I used to smoke. I say it's weird because before, smoking was almost a whole aspect of my personality, something I couldn't -and wouldn't- give up.

I think exercise -and some mental barriers I managed to take down- was the thing that truly helped me go on without cigs. I know I'm preaching to the converted, but really, exercise a lot; walk, jog, run, do HIIT. Do something taxing to your body, everyday if you can. You will absolutely cough up a long, you will hate how out of breath you are, your knees will hurt, you won't be able to get up in the morning; but all of this is temporary. You will breathe better, lift more and have more stamina if you keep going everyday. Switch a nasty habit for a healthy one.

Plus I was only 20, and quite stupid. Vaped for 3 years before the health crisis this year, quit for a few months before a very stressful few events had me back on nicotine again. I thought it helped my anxiety, which had only gotten worse as time went on. It sure felt like it did.

I was keeping up with the news. I knew I was making myself sick. I was scared for my health in the back of my mind, but that's the power of addiction. Your life is at risk and you still dont care. Mystery illnesses killing people my age. Sure, cigarettes kill you slow, but vapes? We literally don't know. Insufficient data.

Woke up last Friday short of breath. Heart racing. Went to work thinking it was just the anxiety, but it only got worse. I could only think ""I never thought this could happen"" and ""oh my god, this is it"". My legs hurt. My lower back hurt. Thought maybe my kidneys were working overtime clearing me out. Coworkers said I looked pale.

Left early and went to the hospital, panicking hard. They did a chest x-ray after I explained my concerns and symptoms. 

I sat on the hospital bed, shirtless with electrodes on my chest, scared out of my mind, for the longest 10 minutes in history. I could see it; the nurse was gonna walk in and tell me I had the lungs of a 70 year old, and they were gonna keep me for the night, or put me on oxygen. 

I thought I was gonna die. I thought I was gonna have to tell my friends and family. My girlfriend.

When she said my chest x-ray was totally clear, I broke down crying on the spot. She said it was psychosomatic; all in my head. Serious anxiety attack. Vaping was, in reality, only making my anxiety worse, making me actively think of how my health could be negatively affected.

I started vaping roughly 4 years ago to get off cigarettes, it worked like a charm. It took me 4 years to smash that second lock and get my wife to hide my vape stuff. That was Nov 6th this year. I was using nic gum to take the edge off after that. 

Some time during the week last week while I was working, I just... stopped taking the gum from my car, then started leaving it at home. 

I still feel a bit fuzzy, my anxiety and depression seem to be stabilizing somewhat but that could just be my medication adjusting to stuff. I turned 30 this year. 

I am proud, beyond proud. I have had to fight myself to not use the gum today, theres no point. 20m of feeling that deep buzz then what, disappointment and shame. I never thought I would get to that point. Literally I once cried and refused to go to a party because I had no cigarettes. 

If I can hazard a guess, my last lot of nicotine was on the 10th December, or the 9th.

It is not like I haven't quit before.  I have several times. The longest being five years with occasional one time cheats at bars.  However, my most recent quit attempts with NRT only made me more addicted because I had a hard judging to much for the gum and lozenges.  I went from one pack to two packs a day.  And worried about coming down off so much nicotine.   I have Nic patches but not for the first step anymore. Thought about just using two of third step or something. Until I can order more for free through my health insurance benefit.   Or I might cut the lozenges in half because I sucked on them alot. I have a lil gum I could use but not enough till I can order more.  I don't like vaping.

I quit smoking December 1. It was Sunday. I had my last cigarette at 8:30pm while hiding out on the side of my in-laws house. It was freezing and windy. I remember thinking, good riddance it's goddamn cold and I'm tired of freezing my butt off for this.

I smoked my first cigarette when I was 15. My family had moved out of state, and the friends I made at my new school were smokers. I wanted to fit in with a crowd, and they accepted me as a new member in their crowd. We were at lunch, and my friend, Vanessa, offered me a drag of her cigarette. I loved smoking immediately.

When I left home at 18, my habit really picked up and continued to increase while I was in college. I lived in a town where you could still smoke inside bars, and since I spent a lot of time in bars, I smoked a lot of cigarettes. I tried to quit once, but it was at the insistence of the person I was dating at the time. It wasn't my choice. Needless to say, that relationship didn't last but my affair with cigarettes continued hot and heavy.

Fast forward a number of years... I'm pregnant. It was easier for me to quit smoking while pregnant than I thought possible. I didn't cheat once. I was even able to hold off for three months after my son was born, but then I went back to work. Stress started to creep in, and I became overwhelmed trying to juggle a newborn, work, and mounting anxiety.

I'm 30 now. I've lost one uncle to pancreatic cancer and my aunt (his sister) was diagnosed with the same silent killer two months ago. Both were heavy smokers. Doctors can't confirm it was cigarette smoking that took his life and will ultimately take hers, but there's suspicion.

My parents have known I was a smoker since I was 21. They didn't approve but they never antagonized me about it. I think they figured it was something that I would eventually outgrow and they weren't paying for cigarettes so they kept out of it. They even had an ash tray ready for me when I visited. When my aunt was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in October, I received a message from my dad. My dad is a stoic observer and rarely emotional. He has a quiet strength about him, and when he speaks, we sit up and listen. In his message to me, he pleaded -*pleaded-* with me to quit smoking, and I told him I would. I don't lie to my dad anymore. It took me about a month to prepare myself and then I quit cold turkey.

It's now been 11 days 16 hours and 48 minutes since my last cigarette.

It's been really hard mentally more than physically. At first, I had a continuous headache and felt very restless. It was difficult to fall asleep. However, my physical symptoms of withdrawal dissipated after about five days. Mentally, I'm still struggling. I feel like I've broken up with a part of my identity. Relationships were formed and sustained through smoking. It was my break. My excuse. My celebration. My grief.

But despite this feeling of loss, I'm really proud of myself. I haven't gone without smoking for this long in three years, and I'm doing it.

I'm on day 6 with the 25mg patch and really struggling (I had 4 cigs on day 1, and 1 cig on day 2). I'm using 1.5mg lozenges too. I was a very heavy smoker for 13/14 years and I liked to punctuate everything I did with a smoke(eating, sleeping, cleaning, walking, working, mariokart, anything at all!).

I just feel like I've been fighting for the past 6 days and the longer it goes on, the more exhausted and weakened I become. At the same time I seem to be developing a bit of insomnia and not sleeping as well as I used to. I've tried leaving the patch on overnight and taking it off. I seem to be groggier and mean in the morning if I take it off. I've also gone to the gym 3 times in the past 6 days. I'm starting to wonder will the whole NRT experience be like this and then it will just be cold turkey madness.

Other side effects are forgetfulness. I've become a bit ""irregular"" in the bathroom department with less movement (I'm totally cringing at this language, but it's hard for me talk about poop with strangers). I have less of an appetite.  I'm irritable (it's 2 weeks before xmas and I want to punch Mariah Carey, Xmas tress and anyone in a hideous xmas jumper). I'm finding it hard to focus at work too... and a bit extra anxious.

I'm looking for people's detailed experiences with patches and maybe lozenges. I'm searching and just finding ""patches worked for me"" or ""NRT doesn't work"" and there's not much more detail. These contributions lead me to try patches in the first place, so I'm still grateful that people made these comments.

I'd love to know if this is all normal or if I'm a total mess and this treatment is wrong for me. A lot of people make it out like going on the patches was the easiest thing ever and I'm just not feeling it. Some expectations would be useful too. I know everyone's experience is different, but I'd still like to know about it.

Thanks for reading.

**Update**

I think I'm on day 12 now. Things have improved, the cravings are less intense and less frequent so I'm feeling a lot less drained. The change became more noticeable around day 9. I still dread them, but I'm not angry or mean anymore (I was very snappy last weak).I switched to 4mg fruity gum, which is twice the strength of the lozenges I was on, but I'm consuming about half the amount. I will still have the occasional lozenge, but I switched to the Nicorette brand. They're less gross than the niquitin ones which I found I very chalky and they'd turn into a nasty paste after a while too, making me feel a bit nauseous. I also switched to Nicorette invisi-patches, which are much more flexible and actually stay put for the day, even through my workouts.

The insomnia issue has subsided and I'm sleeping more now than I did before and finding it very difficult to get out of bed in the morning. I'm finding it easier to get through work without smoking than my free time, so I'm a little bit worried about the xmas holidays.

All in all, finding things are getting better with time. The first week was so hard and I was starting to loose hope because there wasn't much improvement and I was feeling more and more drained after each craving. It was kind of like being in a fight where you just keep getting punched in the head, but eventually your opponent will get tired.

Long version: smoked Reds and unfiltered at about 1.5-2 packs a day for 12 years.

so this morning i got up...i didn't feel rushed like i normally would.  i realized after i got ready i had a whole half an hour of nothing to do, so i sat in front of the TV with my coffee and watched something.  i couldn't believe it....the last time i could remember watching anything in the morning was in elementary school when i would watch cartoons before the bus came lol.

i used to hate bumping into people when i was on my way to have a smoke because it would cut into my smoking time (so ridiculous) but now i find that i actually enjoy these small interactions during the day.

in conclusion....smoking really stopped me from living in the moment.  everything revolved around smoking and i'm sad that i missed out on so much for so long.  not only does smoking cut your lifespan short if you don't stop, but it also prevents you from living the life you still have.",20,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6750984}"

I can't believe it's been a month already since I've started quitting.  I'm hoping this is permanent.  I've started vlogging as a way to cope with my nicotine cravings and withdrawal.  I thought I'd share some tips I've found helpful in pushing myself to take the first crucial step (quitting) and stay clean for the first month.  You can watch it here:

[https://youtu.be/0jPEfsKFqmg](https://youtu.be/0jPEfsKFqmg)  


For those who can't, don't want or don't have the time for a video, here are my tips:

1. Decide you want to quit for yourself.  You have to want it.
2. Set a solid date of when you are quitting.  No excuses!
3. Set small achievable goals to keep you motivated and get through the cravings.
4. Stay away from temptation.
5. When the cravings get bad, relax and take some deep breaths until they subside.

Given this is the end of the first month, this is probably the last video I'll be posting here in a while (I'll post other stuff in my YT channel though).   Maybe I'll do something vaping/smoking related again at the end of the second month, or if I hit any snags (hopefully none).

2019-12-12 00:03:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/e9j1vb/one_month_thoughts/,One month thoughts,"The key for me was to defend and look out for myself through the times I was experiencing the thought and/or feeling that lighting another cigarette would be beneficial to me in some way. If I light another cigarette it will help me maintain my identity, if I light another cigarette then I will be able to have a better time, if I light another cigarette I will feel more present...

&nbsp;

It was so crucial to handle this experience every time it happened without fixating too hard on the fact that I was beginning down a smoke-free path from here on out (this is up to me). In reality, I am continuing down the path I already am on where the decision to light up is and was always in my hands and now I will entertain the option to say no in a more serious fashion. I will do that by putting as much effort as is required into lasting through the duration of each craving as it happens. The only thing I truly need to be aware of is each current craving because if I was to anticipate the imaginary impending inferno of every future craving all at once on top of my current craving then I would turn to an anxious mess with (most likely) a lit cigarette in my mouth.

&nbsp;

Let yourself be present for the experience of becoming smoke-free. Facts, figures, statistics and gadgets are cool, but this is really a ""you"" thing. Don't be afraid to have your own story on how you became a smoke-free person. Your own methods, opinions and ideas are valid.

&nbsp;

It's like having a little garden. You know you want a healthy garden, but there are obstacles that seem to get in your way (cravings). Just keep tending to your garden. Nurture it. Pull weeds as necessary and find ways to keep out any critters that may harm the growth of your garden. If you do your best you may get the results of a flourishing garden at some point or another. The effort is what counts most here. Take your successes as they come. I would not recommend beating yourself up, although at some point you need to cultivate a level of discipline if you want to become smoke-free because it can be very unpleasant and tedious at first.

&nbsp;

One cool thing (among many) about saying no to cigarettes is that while you were busy making it through one craving at a time, your addiction to nicotine was fading. So even if you crave the idea of a cigarette, there will be no nicotine addiction to fortify that idea and gnaw at you until you spark one up. It's pretty much just an idea once the craving is gone. However, you still need to watch out for inclement weather and keep your wits about you.

I'm 27 and am a Vape product user. Bad day? Nicotine. Drinking? Nicotine. Something bothering me? Nicotine. general stress? Nicotine... ect...  

I promised my wife (before we married), that I'd have a plan to stop my nicotine consumption. TIFU (Today I F\*\*\*\*d Up). My default setting for this stuff is to ""hide everything, deny anything, make excuses, and make sure my friends say nothing when and if they come over."" and ""I've got this, no one needs to know.""  the TIFU is I was already in the dog house for an unrelated reason. Got drunk, Drunk Brad decided this was the best time to show my true colors, and leave my paraphernalia out on an APOLOGY  note I printed for the unrelated situation.  

Now before anyone says anything, yes, I know: I lied to my wife which is wrong, I lied to myself, and I 100% effed up, because something stupid happened. I work for the TSA (For those not in the U.S. it's the people at the security check point at our airports.). The job is stressful, and getting yelled at all day by passengers (don't apologize that isn't why I'm here clearly, and I don't really care (I can explain more if it's a sticking point)).  I took my break and my coworker offered me a hit on his vape to edge the nerves and it went well beyond that. I went to my local 7/11 and got myself their cheapest vape rig with pods to match. I had no inner monologue, and just reverted to my ""hiding it"" tactics (my default). 

I've been a nicotine addict since I was 14 (I'm 27 now). Vaping was a new thing when I started, and was just coming out. For example, mods weren't a thing, you couldn't build any coils. All that were around were the ""7/11 Alto/Ciro ect.."" kind of things.

 I wanna stop for good, but I can't seem to kick this stupid habit. My wife (bless her heart) is doing her best to understand (She doesn't understand addiction, but she's seeing how it effects me to the best of her ability.) my situation.  I want to explain to her in terms that she can fully grasp what is happening to me and I want her support. 

1. I don't know how to have this conversation.
2. I don't know how describe addition to someone who has never seen or experienced it.
3. I don't know how to stop myself from reverting back to my ""default settings"".
4. I don't really have a supportive network outside of here (Reddit) and my wife.
5. I just need help and I don't really know where to go.

I'm exhausted, I'm stressed, I'm over this addiction, I'm over my default settings, and I'm really just over myself.... Not in a Suicidal way either, this isn't that kind of post. I just want help in a time where I can't seem to help myself... 

Someone on another thread told me that: ""I need to think about how I want to describe this to my wife"" (how I want to have this conversation), and right now I don't know how I want to do that. 

I want to stop. I just don't know how...

Please, any advice is good advice at this point.

This place looks great and I'll be spending some time here over the next few weeks I'd imagine.


I smoked from around 13-16 and then vaped secretly from 19-22.


In the last few years its got a lot worse, I was single for a while so I started vaping a lot more but always kept it a secret. I'm now in a relationship again and have continued hiding it for a couple of years. I've decided it's now time to stop.


Back when I quit smoking, I was probably smoking about 8-10 a day and felt fine after quitting but I had another addiction... My first proper girlfriend and that helped a lot. As in, not that she helped but it just took my mind off things and life was easy at that age for me.


Now things are harder, I'm at a critical point in my life with college and graduation approaching, looking for jobs etc is super difficult and my usage has gone up. I can't trust myself to be in the vicinity of my vape, and so throwing it out is my best cause of action I think. I really don't have enough money to buy a new one, and I'm hoping my financial willpower will top the urge to buy a new one, and I'm 100% confident I won't go buy a pack of smokes.


I haven't gone more than about 4 hours without a vape since I started on it, so this is gonna be tough but I'm gonna go for it.


Unfortunately all the stuff online talks about being with friends or family that can help you through it, but since literally nobody knows for the most part, I can't go to anybody about it.

Instead of, you know, risking divorce with how irrationally angry I was, I had a cigarette.

Last time was pretty similar, but I was a week in and had an argument with a family member- along with being woken up too early.

I‚Äôve never been much of an angry person, so I don‚Äôt really know what to do with it. The irritability is the most uncomfortable part for me.

Being tested for COPD. Quit smoking 9 days ago,"Hello all. I have smoked since I was 11 years old. I'm 57 now, female.  That's 46 years of smoking! I was a heavy smoker for all of those years, 2 packs per day or more. For the past year I have cut down to one pack per day.  I tried all OTC remedies over the years, hypnosis, piercing, vaping, nothing worked.  I got a bad cold 4 weeks ago that turned into severe bronchitis and the inability to draw a good breath, like asthma. I was so sick and so short of breath I felt like I was going to die.  


Went through the standard antibiotics, inhaler, steroid pills and finally got over the bronchitis but I'm still short of breath and the right side of my back hurts when I breathe.  I am currently on a Asthma inhaler and a Steroid inhaler. X Rays were clear and did not show COPD but the Dr. ordered me to see a pulmonologist on Jan 2 to test for it. I am scared, scared enough that I quit smoking and vaping immedietely.  (to be honest, I thought I was ""doing better"" because I was vaping along with smoking, but it hurt to inhale and caused shortness of breath too) I was scared straight. **BREATH IS LIFE!** There is nothing scarier than not being able to breathe!  9 days now, I am chewing nicotine gum to help, but I am feeling better each day although still short of breath by normal standards. I am coughing up phlegm with brown streaks in it ( I have no doubt my lungs are cleaning themselves of tar, etc)  


I have been reading all of your stories and want to ask those of you who read my post to keep me in your thoughts. I am terrified the Dr. will diagnose COPD. It's all fun and games until a life threatening illness looms over you. Please don't wait until you can't draw a good breath to quit like I did! This is the scariest thing I've ever faced. It's hard for me to imagine my life as a non-smoker, it has been my identity for so long, like baked into my DNA. I still have cravings but I am determined to do this. I hope my poor abused lungs will somewhat heal themselves. Thank you for listening, right now all I feel is scared and alone.",236,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.69660103}"

For three years, vaping was a really great alternative to smoking until my health started taking a hit (increased anxiety, chest/back pain, coughing, headaches, etc).  This Sunday I had a panic attack thinking about what I was doing to myself (while vaping!), and threw it and all the gear away. I was done.

I started with the Mark X, then moved to Juul, then to the Vuse Alto. I quickly moved from a pod a week to a pod a day. Pretty soon, my car, purse, and pockets were full of dead carts that I was keeping ""just in case"" I could get another puff out of them if needed. I can't calculate the amount of money I've spent in the last 3 years (or the last 15 years of smoking total). I wish I could get the time and money back, but I can't so here's to a fresh start. I have broken addictions to food, booze, and drugs before. Nictotine is my last vice to let go of. I can do this.

Symptoms wise, for those that are wondering if the vaping withdrawal is different, it's actually pretty standard:

Day 1

Cravings, irritability, depression, anxiety, insomnia with panic attacks, headache, bargaining, constipation, eating everything not nailed down

Day 2

So tired (so, so tired), cravings (less!), headache (more!), stomach cramps, diarrea (which was a surprise), chest cramps, mild coughing, mild sore throat, weird taste in mouth.

On the positive:

Better, deeper breathing, cravings are settling into a dull noise from a roar, and I feel super proud of myself.

I had success quitting in the past with nicotine patches (I quit for three months, then started smoking again on my 18th birthday because I was excited I could buy smokes), but now the ritual of smoking is just as much of a habit as the addiction, so I'm concerned about how helpful gum would be.

I've been reading up on nicotine's effect on the body, more specifically the neurotransmitters. We all know that nicotine gives us a high. But i found that there are two ways in which this happens.

One is that it triggers dopamine. This is the 'reward' system, the one that we are supposed to get only when we fulfill a goal that we set for ourselves, or a biological goal (good, sex, etc.)

The second is that it also temporarily releases seratonin, this is what makes us feel satisfied and content. A deeper sense of well being. Unfortunately, smoking depletes this in the long run, making us prone to general anxiety.

Now the kicker for me was when i put this together with my craving/smoking timetable - that's when i started seeing how i had been circumventing so many different natural drives and motivations by using cigarettes. For eg. I want to get up in the morning and get going quickly - i used to need a cigarette to make me feel like I'm on the move. Another, when I'm feeling anxious in a group and i need to retreat somewhere, then i have a smoke - rather than tackling my social anxiety.

I realised that all of these learning moments that my body and emotions were creating for me, were going to waste because nicotine was positioning itself as the solve for anything. Now, i don't want that! I want to live my life fully - both the ups and the downs. Especially the downs so that they can guide me to change my environment or myself to get me to a place of piece.

 Smoking is great to keep going after overriding one's natural impulses. But if you want to live a life that is guided by your intuition and natural way of being, then there is no place for nicotine.",20,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4580351}"

After a short time, I began to realize, it really starts within. I began calculating, calculating, and calculating. I went from the day, to the week, to the month, then the year, and of course multiple years. Then I began calculating all vices; tequila on the weekends, trees, cigarettes, and Starbucks every day. I was spending just about $10,000 a year on these vices, and I'm glad to say that I've challenged myself to quit drinking while I get used to living without cigarettes. Or maybe, who knows, I may quit them all forever. 

But anyways back to the money part. On cigarettes alone, an average of $10 a day for a pack of Newports adds up to $70 BUX A WEEK, $140 EVERY 2, AND $300 FOR A MONTH (30 DAYS).  Which averages out to $3650 for a 365 day Newport habit.",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4470763}"

Few days ago i got really drunk and was craving a cigarette a lot. I thought about the reason, and imagined smoking one as it really feels like. Cold ashes in my mouth, the dizziness, the upset stomach, and the craving passed. This happened 3 times, I let them all pass.

I'm 33 and my hands and feet are *freezing* cold and a kind of purple-ish colour, I have had no energy and no confidence, and my dad passed away at the not so grand old age of 59 this year thanks to lung cancer.

I feel like I'm in some sort of zen-like state where every wave of withdrawal is actually enjoyable. I'm actually smiling to myself all the time and enjoying feeling the warmth in my hands and feet and basically all over my body. I actually feel alive right now. My hands are a normal colour again, I smell good and I'm sleeping great. 

The main thing I'd have to say that's making this way more manageable is that I'm not scared. If you're scared, you're screwed, because that's what nicotine wants.

When it was time to switch down from ""step1"" to ""step2"" I decided to just discontinue use of NRT instead.

One thing I have noticed since I discontinued nicotine use is an increase in frustration and irritability -- both in terms of frequency and intensity.  Sometimes even trivial situations evoke anger.  Sometimes the angry response comes on VERY quickly and often is in response to trivial stuff.

While trying to understand this phenomenon better and in hopes of finding helpful strategies I came across an article I found interesting.  It covers a lot of the general things we all already know but also provided other insights, for example, describing physical processes that can trigger or worsen one's response to a given situation or stressors.

If nothing else, it took several minutes to actually read the article and by the time I was done, the frustration I was experiencing that led me to search Google in the first place had dissipated.

The first full day was awful and the second day I was so restless that I went for a 2 hour walk. 

Since day 3, I haven't had any of those sharp headaches where your brain is telling you that you need nicotine. 

I have been eating more but that is partly due to other stress and the fact that we have a little extra money now (not because I quit). But I've only gained 0.5lbs so it's alright and I caught it quick so I'm back on track to lose more weight.

I can't sleep. I've been up almost every hour every night since I quit. Which means I'm tired and I'm sure that's contributing to my over eating. 

Pilates is much easier already! I do pilates 5 times a week at home in the morning and my muscles can take a lot more than they used to! Plus I did a cardio video which I would never have done even before smoking because I have asthma but I survived! 

I'm considerably less thirsty but I'm still trying to aim for 3L of water per day. 

I'm really enjoying not going outside every half hour into the cold and snow and rain. 

I'm just happier..? I feel good about quitting and I can already feel my body getting healthier. Which was the whole point in losing weight and doing pilates again, to be healthier, so this is just the last step in that plan. 

I feel like I'm too hot all the time! I guess my blood circulation has returned to normal (or at least better than it was). My hands and feet haven't been cold since I quit, and in general, I'm too hot.... all the time! I'll have to determine how many layers I need for what temperature all over again. 

And lastly, best of all, my resting heartrate went from between 66bpm and 82bpm to between 54bpm and 66bpm! In just one week of quitting, my resting heartrate hasn't gone above my old lowest. How cool is that?

Edit: two more things. 1) I have had less phlegm in the morning and my morning breath is way better than it was 2) I coughed up something very dark yesterday morning which I think is the tar in my lungs breaking off which I'm told is a good thing ?",2,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.8221457}"

I returned home from college and decided it was time to kick a number of bad habits. The habit I was/am most eager to kick is smoking. For background, I was at ~ a pack a day. I successfully stopped smoking (cold turkey) for about a week over break. Being home was a great environment for dealing with the withdrawal symptoms (which included brain fog, headaches, low/depressed mood). I didn't have to be insanely social and had my Dad for comfort when I had any temptations. However, upon returning to college I picked smoking back up when I had an anxiety-inducing paper to finish. Not the best idea, I know. Nonetheless, I am still eager to quit knowing that I was successful all last week. I am trying to take better care of my body and I am really motivated to do this.
I want to start ASAP...
The problem is, I am unsure if college is a good environment for me to go through the withdrawal symptoms. With around 2 weeks left of classes, I don't want to be in a depressed mood around my friends or in general... especially while trying to finish the semester strong. I was thinking of using a nicotine patch, so I am not actually smoking and my lungs can start to heal.

I suffer from asthma and since i've started smoking i've had a constant cough and noticed grey flecks in my phlegm. I've finally decided to quit but i'm not sure whether going cold turkey or reducing my intake day per day is better.

I've been reducing my intake over the past 2 months now (going from 10 per day to 5) but i still get that craving for a cigarette every hour or so, I just ignore it and tell myself i'm going to have one in 2 hours. I've started vaping to help the reduce the cravings while i drecrease my cigarette count but now i've found myself mindlessly chainsmoking a lot of the time.

Should i continue to try and reduce my cigarette count as it seems to be working (from 10 to 5) or should i drop it and try to go cold turkey because i'm worried that by decreasing my count isn't going to help me fully quit as i still crave for cigarettes hourly.

Also I started smoking menthol cigarettes last year (yes i know) but i like the taste. Would switching back to normal ones help me quit faster (dislike the taste more so i would have less cravings) or will it make me more addicted (get used to normal taste of tobacco)

The first cigarettes I can remember having were when I was a dishwasher my senior year of high school. Then came college. I think my freshman year I didn‚Äôt smoke much but was using chewing tobacco/dip alot. Then sophomore year came, then junior, then senior, then first year real world... now I‚Äôve been out of college for ~6 years and the longest I‚Äôve gone without smoking was about 6 months.

Its never really been an ‚Äúissue‚Äù for me; my friends did it too, it wasnt crazily expensive to smoke a pack over a few days (maybe even a week) and I‚Äôm not _feeling_ any direct threats to my health.

But, I want to stop. I want to stop because I want to never have to leave my girlfriend (who doesn‚Äôt smoke) to go outside with people to do smoke just have a cigarette. I never want to worry about walking into my office wondering if i fucking reek of that smell. I never want to wake up with not only a hangover from drinking, but a riot of a headache because I smoked an entire pack of cigarettes that night too. And I just don‚Äôt want to fucking have cigarettes be a part of my life any more! I waste time (like writing this post) thinking about them, I spend money on them (I‚Äôve even purchased a pack, smoked a single cigarette, thrown it away in disgust, only to purchase ANOTHER pack the same day), and get EMBARRASSED by them when Im around others. NONE of those things are things people have to deal with if they just don‚Äôt. fucking. smoke.


So, the last cigarette I had was November 13th, 2019. Woke up with a bad hangover. The next week i was sick, so I‚Äôm not sure I woulda smoked anyways, got a freebie. Last week: smoke free and ailment-free. And I did it! No smokes. I did have some nicotine gum which actually did come in handy. I know its only delaying the physical symptoms of nicotine withdrawal but hey, not smoking is not smoking.

Today was tough. It was snowy, made me want one. But I‚Äôm about to go to bed, so I won today. And ya know what? If i were to remember today a few weeks from now, it wont be because it was a day I didn‚Äôt smoke. It will be because of things that happened at work or at home. The same way last week was. I don‚Äôt remember  last Thursday because ‚Äúi didn‚Äôt smoke‚Äù. I remember it because I had a great time having dinner with my girlfriend and her family.

It asked me to call him when I got the chance. I closed my office door and called him immediately as I was awaiting updates about his health. He said, ""Well, it doesn't look very good. I met with the pulmonologist and it looks like it's inoperable."" I closed my eyes and felt the pit in my stomach and kept listening. ""There might be a second opinion from a different surgeon but I'm not very confident they're going to tell me any different. If I stop current treatment I don't know how much time I'll have. They can't say. Maybe a year? More? Less."" I gave him as much reassurance as I could muster. I have to hand it to my dad that he's always been so calm and rational. And even with an expiration date now lingering over his head his approach doesn't seem different. He said that if he were to die he'd always hoped it'd be a heart attack and that he'd be gone in 2 minutes -- minimize the pain. However dying this way might be serendipitous in affording him a little extra time to wrap up his affairs. Man, it feels so fucking weird to type that out.

My dad smoked a little less than a pack a day for 20 some years. He worked a high stress job which didn't do his health any favors. A sedentary lifestyle didn't help either. He finally quit smoking 10 years ago and we all very proud of him in sticking to it. However the damage was done as he developed health problems from smoking for so long. This isn't his first rodeo with cancer. He evaded two other diagnoses but it finally caught him. I'm sad that he will never fully be able to enjoy his retirement. I'm sad that, if I have children, they'll never be able to meet their grandpa.

I had been quit for 10 years myself and then stupidly relapsed when I bummed a smoke off a friend. Before I knew it I got hooked. It's been 162 days since my last cigarette. With the news of my dads life being ultimately cut short by it, I know that I can never touch it again. It'd be disrespectful to his legacy. 

I'd always read these stories of other smokers getting lung cancer and it'd always give me this temporary sense of pity 'how sad' but it never resonated as strongly. It always happens to 'someone else' you know? It wasn't until someone close to me  was affected, and in this case my dad, that it felt more real. And how real it is. As you read this maybe you'll think about it for just a moment, feel that pang of pity, and move on to something else. I hope though that maybe this post might stick with you and maybe help someone by being an additional push to help you put down that cigarette for good.

I'm not looking for sympathy from this post although I appreciate it because of how supportive this subreddit is. I'd just like to extract something good from this awful development; maybe this story can potentially help one more person to successfully quit smoking before it affects themselves personally and those that they love. 

Thank you for reading this. Remember to take it just one day at a time. That was how I successfully quit. The thought of never smoking again felt so long and hard.

I‚Äôve smoked for 20 years. Prior to quitting a few days ago, I was smoking half a pack but they were all in the evening. Wine+smokes+stupid games on phone became my way to unwind and also a way for me to take breaks from work when I had to work long hours. Nothing else seemed to relieve stress quite the same way. I know that I was creating the fake relief by perpetuating the nicotine addiction, but it still seemed like it was really relieving stress. Then I would wake up the next day and feel guilty and depressed for not accomplishing more. This whole ritual became a cycle of escape, guilt, and depression. So I finally got up the courage to try again and quit 5 days ago.

These first 5 days haven‚Äôt been too bad. I‚Äôve had a few panicky moments but rode them out. The worst was after driving 12 hours home from Thanksgiving. Stressful drive. My mind kept telling me that I would be able to destress with a cig and glass of wine when I got home. And then I would remember I was now a non-smoker, and it made me panic. Even brought me to tears at one point. I got home and watched a movie to distract myself, and it worked!

I quit smoking over a year ago and quit nicotine all together over 10 months ago. Obviously I've had the regular symptoms of depression/anxiety/irritability during the withdrawal phase. Unfortunately, these symptoms never seem to have left.

I used to be a happy-go-lucky adventurous person, but now I've become introverted and prone to panic attacks from any social interaction.

I assumed these symptoms were associated with the withdrawal from nicotine, but now it's been too long for that to be the case, right?

I've gone to my Dr. and she prescribed me anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds, which have helped a little,  but I still am far from the person I used to be.

Has anyone else experienced anything like this when they quit? I need help because now my irritability is affecting my relationship with my wife and children. I would rather smoke (as detestable as that sounds to me) and die young of lung cancer than lose my relationship with my wife and children over these stupid emotions.

Edit:
I know it's been a long ass time and probably no one will see this edit, but I just wanted to let everyone know that I just had a generic screen and I have a mutation that leads to low seratonin levels.  

As nicotine artificially boosts seratonin levels in the brain, the full symptoms were not noticible until I quit smoking.  

With the real underlying issue identified, I've been prescribed meds that directly address the issue and have made a major difference in my life.

I wanted to share the good news of being 5 days smoke free! I was smoking a pack a day for 20 years, this is my second time stopping (first time was 10 years ago and lasted 8 months). It's been surprisingly easy, I got quite ill a week ago, a cold that turned into a pretty bad bronchitis. Something clicked in my head and I decided to quit. 

My first big test was this weekend, not only going out but being surrounded by smokers, and getting drunk. I'm very surprised the cravings were not worse - I barely felt like smoking myself, enjoyed the smell of it around me to some extent but it really didn't play on my mind that much.

Aside from this, I have very little side effects of quitting. Last time I had crazy vivid dreams for a week, was coughing quite a lot. This time around I just feel more tired than usual, my sleep quality is not great, but that's about it.

I'd be curious to know if anyone else here has had an ""easy"" quit? I was expecting things to be way harder, I feel very lucky, even though I know it might not be that easy all the time. I really do feel that the fact that something clicked in my head makes it obvious and quite hassle-free. Crazy how the brain works huh.

Anyway, good luck to all, happy to chat with whoever needs help or tips.",37,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.43774348}"

I‚Äôve seen a few motivational memes that really stuck with me. The biggest ones have got to be ‚ÄúYour future self would appreciate it if you stopped doing all this dumb stuff in the present‚Äù and ‚ÄúDid you fail today? That shouldn‚Äôt make you give up. Keep trying until you don‚Äôt have to try so hard. Then keep trying until you don‚Äôt have to try at all.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know what it is this time but I really hope it sticks. I wanna say I‚Äôve quit but I‚Äôve said that a lot in the past so I feel like I kinda lost my right to use it. So I‚Äôm taking a hiatus for as long as I possibly can, hopefully for the next 50-60 years. God I hope I don‚Äôt live that long.

Leading up to quitting: I had really cut down on my smoking due to the cold. Each time I wanted a smoke I would look outside and be like ‚ÄúKill myself and freeze my tits off in the process? No thanks.‚Äù Sometimes I did brave the cold, but majority of times I wouldn‚Äôt make it halfway through a smoke before I was heading back in. In both instances I would use it as an excuse to cutback on smoking or just not do it. This slowly built up over about a month. If it was warm outside there‚Äôs no way in hell I‚Äôd be writing this. 

25 November: Woke up with a nasty taste in my mouth. I got up to go have my morning smoke and I was thinking about this taste I had. I wanted it gone but if I brush my teeth before smoking I‚Äôm going to have to brush again. So I made a decision standing in front of my sliding door that my health is more important than feeding an addiction that is designed to keep you smoking. Also, f* big tobacco. That makes my resolve even stronger. This is my middle finger saying ‚ÄúYou had me for a while, but that shit is over.‚Äù

Day 7/Today: I‚Äôve had a couple urges to smoke but nothing I couldn‚Äôt turn down by saying to myself ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs stupid. Do you wanna smell like smoke, ruin your teeth, and all that other bad stuff?‚Äù I don‚Äôt know how accurate it is but I was once told nicotine takes 72 hours to be out of your system. I kept telling myself the withdrawal symptoms are the hardest part and they would be over real soon. I think my cravings now are purely habitual now so I‚Äôm not afraid of headaches or agitation when I say no.

On a personal note: I‚Äôm happy a lot of friends are supporting me. But I‚Äôm very proud of myself. I quit cold turkey 7 days ago while rooming with 3 smokers.

I really wanted to share this but also I hope that this post provides motivation and helps people move closer to being smoke free. Thanks for reading.",19,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.49528462}"

the e-cigarette worked so well for me, I traded smoking for vaping 3 years ago and never looked back

I guess it was kinda hard to make the switch, I couldnt just give up smoking for vaping, I had to gradually switch over, first I would just hit the vape for the novelty and flavours and rely on the cigerettes for my cravings, then I switched to only smoking important cigs, like after meal, or with my morning coffee, then I slowly shifted to only using the cigs in the morning, with my coffee I would have 1-3 and I would vape the whole rest of the day, and finally it was just 1 with my morning cofffee and eventually it was none a day, and I was just a vaper

so is it the difficulty of switching? on one hand, if I thought of it as switching, I might have found it difficult to do, but instead the way it just kinda happened it seems like it couldnt of been easier 

when I did make the switch I felt 100X better health wise, the only reason I decided to quit recently is im tired of being a slave to the device and spending good money after the bad, so I wonder why there isnt more people quitting the e-cig

so im 14 days nicotine free, and im still ""addicted"" to vaping 0mg fluid, if anyone has a solution to quiting the habit part, let me know, I have about 1L left which will last me approximately 85 days, I d like to be quit by then and not buy any more",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.47517654}"

I‚Äôm a nurse. Mostly I work intense hours full of some serious stressful events. I‚Äôve been wanting to quit smoking for the past couple of years. Every time I‚Äôve tried to quit I hardly ever make it past a month before I give into temptation. I go back to smoking. Then I quit again.

I could go on and on about the things I hate about it... the cost... having to deal with extreme weather just to get a ‚Äúfix‚Äù... my skin aging faster than it should... cleaning out my car so often... making trips to the store to buy more when I could simply be resting at home... my decline in my ability to smell and taste... 

My last cigarette was a couple of hours ago. I‚Äôm off of work. I‚Äôm getting ready to sleep... so, technically when I wake up it‚Äôll be my first full day of quitting.

Wish me luck. I‚Äôve decided to post here daily as a reminder to keep going. Thinking of other ways to pass the 60+ minutes I normally spend smoking everyday.
