I called ahead of time and no one was there, I made sure we touched nothing and scribed your before we left and stripped and showered as soon as we were home. But the fact that I had to take us both to an urgent care and possibly expose us to covid 19, has me feeling like the worst parent in the world.

So I quit. 

I had one send off cig with my partner and we both quit same day. I think the worst part is dealing with the stress multiplying due to situations out of my control and feeing like I should have a cig because I ‚Äúdeserve it‚Äù or something. 

I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm smoke free and I only finished about half of Allen Carr‚Äôs book. After it clicked that I really am being controlled by a bit of plant in a poorly made filter by a corporation, I just didn‚Äôt want it. That and the fact it just smells awful. 

I made myself accountable by throwing out my lighters, cleaning my entire car that I bought after I promised to quit, and downloading the app to keep track. Do I still sometimes think about smoking? Absolutely. But the idea of the rancid smell and it getting stuck to my hands and my breath turn me off. 

I only quit after I joined this sub and cruised around for a week and realized all the people who support each other, the long time quitters, the people not knowing where to start, etc. I appreciate every one of you and hope your quit journey‚Äôs are going well.

However, I had been feeling short of breath for quite some time now, and with COVID-19 making its way around the globe, I just randomly stopped in the middle of the day 9 days and 13 hours ago. I did so cold turkey. That‚Äôs because I do not see my battle as one with nicotine. My battle is a psychological one. It‚Äôs not the nicotine I crave. It‚Äôs the habit and process of smoking a cig that I crave. In fact, since I often smoke tobacco, I actually miss the process of making my own cigs. 

Can I just say, this hasn‚Äôt been easy for me at all. It‚Äôs been arduous and a real struggle. I have been pacing around my house due to isolation and even exercised for the first time in quite a while yesterday. I‚Äôm happy to report that I can take a deep breath so much more comfortably now and shortness of breath has almost disappeared. 

For the past few mornings, I‚Äôve got up and made myself a cigarette using tobacco I have left over. I have done so in order to ease my craving to partake in the smoking process. I know that sounds funny, but it has helped. I‚Äôve gone outside into my garden with the cig like I used to. But instead of lighting the cig, I have sat down, took 5 deep breaths, and meditated for 10 minutes. I then look at my none smoking app to see the progress I have made, then come onto this thread with the hope that I‚Äôll see a post that will further  discourage me from putting a cig to my mouth. In fact, whenever I have a craving, I read this thread to get through it. Afterwards, I then come back inside the house, crush the cigs that I‚Äôve made, and throw them away. 

I am winning the psychological battle and I will not be defeated.",38

Let me start this by saying I tried many different ways quitting smoking and I always end up failing. I would always fail and I wouldn't even last a day back then even if I try not to smoke for just 12 hrs, to see if I can pull it off but the cravings and the nicotine addiction would win, it was a constant battle between me and the ingrained habit that I developed through the years.  


Then 2 months ago I don't know what happened inside me, I just quit, like it was the easiest thing to do maybe something in me click or something, I don't seriously know because I never even thought hard about it, I just quit. What's weirder is that I never had a craving not even once, it baffles me that back then it was super hard for me to quit, to just suddenly stop as if it was irrelevant.

So far, I tried cutting down today and I am starting to feel some withdrawals.

Part of me would rather get through the withdrawals sooner than later.

And this is best and the worst news for me, a smoker who is trying to quit.
Why worst time? THE CRAVINGS. UNBEARABLE CRAVING. I am a closet smoker so I don't have a stash on hand. Here you can go out and buy a single stick, smoke and leave. You don't need to buy the entire pack. That was my daily routine for past 8 years. I am not a heavy smoker, 4-5 a day kind. But those 4-5 a day had me hooked. And I was totally unable to quit. Now as the entire country is on lock down, I can't go out and just smoke one out. Even if I managed to get out of the house on pretence of getting some groceries, I still won't be able to get cigarettes.

This is the best thing happening to me. This means I won't be smoking for 21 days. Which in turn means I have a shot at quitting this expensive and disgusting ~~habit~~ addiction. 21 days are said to require for habit to form or break.


Wish me luck. Hope this is my last post here.",25

I've been smoking for about 15 years, with a few brief quits.  I've had asthma since I was a kid. 

And about 11 days ago, I was in close contact with someone who soon thereafter began to show all of the symptoms for coronavirus (but can't get tested).  I feel fine, and I am **so** damn lucky.  But I'm still not out of the woods for three more days, and even then, the virus is going to keep spreading.  This pandemic is going to continue for a long time.  Even though I'm privileged enough to be able to quarantine, that doesn't mean I'm safe.  I've procrastinated and made excuses long enough.  

I'm about to start chapter 17 of Allen Carr's book.  This will be my third quit using it.  The last two were the easiest and most successful of my quits.  Both times I sabotaged them, it was a deliberate decision.  Third time's the charm.  

Thank you to everyone who has shared their stories here.  I've been lurking for a couple of days and writing down some of your best nuggets of wisdom in the blank pages of the Carr book, for extra motivation.  I look forward to finishing the book, trashing any remaining smokes, and starting my timer in SmokeFree.  All of you who have made it an hour or a week or a year, you're amazing.

Tonight i just woke up to use the bathroom, and spit thinking nothing of it but there was a decent bit of blood in the spit. Few more tried and each time was bloody. I'm now noticing a bit of a feeing like mucous is in my  lower thoat and can taste blood. Is this normal after smoking? Getting paranoid about this covid-19 with all thats going on.

Thanks yall  


Update: So I went to an urgent care this morning. Chest Xray showed lungs are fine. Just a slight wheezing in one but nothing to be worried about. Blood was likely a small burst vessel. But when I described the chest pain, and shortness of breath I've had for over a month, they got me an EKG. I always assumed those were related to smoking and would get better once I quit. Never thought it had anything to do with my heart. After the EKG they are referring me to a cardiologist asap. Doctor wouldn't be specific as to what he is worried about, but him wanting me in there asap has me nervous about maybe being at risk for a heart attack. I'm thin and only 29 so never considered that risk, but I guess smoking 15 years makes that a possibility?  


Thanks for pushing the doctor y'all, hopefully all is good",20

It helped me quit easily and enjoyably for a few months, then I did what he warns not to.  I haven't been able to kick it for more than a couple weeks since those few months 5 years ago.  I managed to go a whopping 6 hours today but finally caved.  While standing outside I couldn't help but think of how fascinating and infuriating the psychological aspect of smoking is.  It's really true.  The withdrawal isn't even noticeable.  It merely triggers a psychological response and that's what trips you up.  Any tips on how to be mindful/what to remind yourself of when psychological withdrawal is kicking in?  I'll start to work things out in my head but then I frustratedly shake my head, figure ""screw it, I lost again"" and light up.  It's so infuriating!  Why, if it was so easy using his method before won't it sink in again? :(",4

I grew up with parents who smoked and HATED it. I never in a million years thought I would be a smoker myself - especially choosing a career in the health/fitness industry...talk about the ultimate cognitive dissonance. 

I casually smoked for the past 6 years, but after a miscarriage, divorce, and having the come to terms with my new reality it got really bad. Half a pack bad and desperately trying to not smell like cigs when I went to teach my workout classes. 

Who knew that with the world stopping because of a respiratory virus would give me the kick in the ass I was looking for, but I am so grateful.

I used the patch for the first couple days, but after watching Joe Rogan's interview with Duncan Trussell I got inspired to challenge myself and work through the withdrawls. They got SUPER bad on day 3, but i've been pushing forward with my cravings as an opportunity to have SOMETHING in my life to control. 

I also inadverently stopped drinking so that I can stay strong with quitting. Oh and also not downloading dating apps or talking to previous guys whom I knew there was no connection (LOL.) This whole self discipline experiment is fascinating because i've peeled off almost all the layers of distraction I typically use to avoid my boredom or dissapointment in where I am in my life currently. 

I don't have a magical epiphany quite yet, but meditating every morning has helped me see the wounds I still need to heal and also the creative excitement I have to simply be alive. 

ANYWAY. If anyone else has quit this past week - congrats!!! WE'RE DOING THE DAMN THING. We got this!",17

When i cease smoking, i almost always endure the first week. By second week it is psychological warfare. I am in my third week now, 2 weeks short of my record.

Smoked twice in my dream, relieved after waking up. Cravings come and i try to cope thinking about the amount i would smoke to satiate myself, and how fucked up my throat would be after all those cigarettes. However, losing this habit sorta freaks me out, thinking about how do i go after life goes normal (i stay home most of the time due to obvious covid reasons), how would i go drinking without lighting a cig?

That's all. Good luck to all who are trying and congrats to all who succeeded (clinically there is a one year mark, but relapse occurs even if it is very rare, good luck)",9

I only did this maybe 4-5 times in total over the span of several months and then I also completely stopped that. It was difficult in the beginning, maybe the most difficult thing I have ever done.

So i hope it helps me just to write down all my thoughts and my story, and hopefully it helps others too.

I smoked for 15 years about 20 cigarettes a day and this is something like my attempt no. 10374 (really have no idea how often I really wanted to quit and how often I ""wanted to quit"" and didn't smoke for something between 5 minutes and 2 hours). 

My longest non-smoking period was about 3 weeks. I always relapsed when I went out with friends, drinking and partying, at some point I always have been dumb enough to think ""just this one while drinking. I lasted X days now and feel good without, so just one can't destroy this"" and yep... guess what... this one destroyed it. Every single time. And I did this same shit over and over again. It had always been ""just this one"" and as soon as I am drinking I'm always dumb enough to repeat this stupidity.

Soooo.... because of lockdown I thought this is just the right moment to quit, because there won't be any partying with friends for a few weeks now. I have been drinking a glas of wine or beer at some days at home and surely the cravings are there as soon as I take the first sip, but it is kind of okay, because there are no smokers snd cigarettes around me and I haven't been drunken. I hope this is some kind of exercise for me now, so that I won't some again while drinking after the lockdown.

All those daily routines like get up - cigarette, coffee - cigarette, out of the shower - cigarette (and yes, I used to be a heavy smoker) got better so fast. It wasn't a big struggle at all. When I think back to my first and second attempt... I have been crying for 3 days all the time, felt just miserable, had the feeling like a friend just died,  had headaches and so on. Now it is like ""ok, so I just don't smoke now"" and it is really, really ok. I don't suffer anymore, but at the same time this is the problem. Because it got kind of easy to stop, I handle it too carelessly and I am afraid that I will smoke again as soon as I am partying.

I had a stabbing pain in my lung from time to time over the last years and something like a heavy feeling most of the time, which made me anxious and I never dared to see a doctor, because I didn't want to know if something was wrong. And on the other hand, it seems like those pains and the fear of getting real sick have not been enough to stop me. 

I really want this to be my last attempt. I know that I am strong enough to never touch a cigarette again. I know that I don't need them. I know that this cravings are caused by the cigarettes themselves and if I smoke just one cigarette I will start this vicious circle again. It is the same shit a few thousand times a year - only because I am inhaling nicotine, I have the cravings for it. I will not start this chain reaktion again!

So this post got long now - thanks to everyone who read this. It helped me to write everything down and remind myself why I quit. And thanks to this whole community. I really have the feeling that I will make it this time because of you all. I'm not alone with this.

Hey, you are terrified of having this bath. That clean feeling will take you away even further from the smoking you just have up on. It's just going to make you miss it more. You're going to feel clean. You won't feel dirty like when you smoke. You will feel further and further away from everything you love. You want your only friends scent to still be on you. Why would you give that up? It's like having a shower after sex. When you could just keep the scent on you to remind you of the good time, for a few more hours at least.

The voice of reason:

Okay, mind, you're grasping at straws here and you're basically being psychotic. You want that clean feeling. That's like half the point of quitting. Freedom from smelling like a disgusting ashtray. Freedom from ruining your teeth. Freedom from ruining your health. You love baths. They feel good. They make you relax and you come out feeling fresh and clean. Again, that's the whole point of the bath. You don't want to feel dirty like when you smoke you fool. You want the clean feeling to be your comfort zone. Like it always was before all of this. And what the heck are you talking about with keeping the smell of cigarettes on you? It makes no sense. You want that smell gone. And don't bring sex into this. Besides, you're straight up inventing lies about yourself right now. Most of the time when it comes to sex, once it's over you're lighting scented candles and having a shower with your lover for the night and getting rid of any trace of your activities so that when people come over there will be no trace of the random debauchery you indulge in left. And then you get on with your day and look forward to living your balanced life. Your mind is making things up as it goes along because it's got distorted thinking due to an addiction.

Well it's there in front of you. What better excuse to give up on your willpower. You're too weak to avoid it now. It's right in front of you. Just give in like you always do. You know you love that feeling. Just have the smoke. You can always quit tomorrow. You're just a day or two in. It will only set you back that much. You've been a smoker for years. What difference will one more day make? Won't giving in to it and just going with it feel better than depriving yourself?

The voice of reason:

Yes, it's in front of you. That doesn't matter. It's completely irrelevant where it is. You've gone to much further lengths to have a smoke. Weakness has nothing to do with it. Think of all the adversity you've faced. Think of all the insurmountable challenges you've overcome. You did most of it effortlessly. You aren't weak. That's just your mind trying to trick you. In addition, there isn't anything to give in to. What you're doing when you smoke is hurting yourself. Why is it that you'd want to hurt yourself? You don't want to. It's just a trick of the mind. Normally when you're hurting, you would want to get out of that situation. You'd want to get out and give in to relaxing free from suffering. Why would this be a situation where it's the opposite? How would it suddenly be in your nature to want to give in and suffer? You want to give in and let go to moments that feel good. Not moments that feel bad. You can't always quit tomorrow. If you're always quitting tomorrow, that's not quitting. That's delaying a quit. Which is the exact opposite of what you want to do. One more day will make the difference of not ever quitting. As it has for years. Also, you're not depriving yourself of anything by not smoking. But when you smoke, you're depriving yourself of your freedom, health and mental wellbeing. Just relax and give in to the fact that there's a smoke in front of you. And that you're not smoking it anyway. That's the moment you want. Freedom from addiction. And it's beautiful. So stop lying to yourself. Just enjoy your new smoke free life, as you should.",3

When I'm talking to one of my friends, who has a serious substance abuse problem (crack), I always feel frustrated and stuck when trying to help him. He feels the same way. But he also makes excuses. And they don't make any sense.

And then I had the realization that I am him. I make a million excuses, justifications and rationalizations. Pretty much any mental process that could possibly lead to me smoking fires up. And the funny thing is it's like watching myself on autopilot. Everything that happens is suddenly tied to some mental process that encourages me to smoke.

I think that's really what addiction is. It's not the physical dependency, that only plays a minor role with smoking. It's not like a headache or some irritability would normally stop me from doing anything.

I think addiction is really my brain learning to seek out dopamine because of a loophole in my mind that links increased dopamine with an experience that encourages survival. So it causes pleasure.

My internal mechanisms don't know how to distinguish dopamine from a cigarette from dopamine from an experience that would naturally trigger my reward system. Like an accomplishment or food and the likes.

So, if I view my addiction as a mistake that my mind is making, there's really only one solution that will work. I have to correct the mistake.

My new strategy is that I'm going to be consciously vigilant and make sure to consciously reprocess what I catch my subconscious mind doing.

If I catch myself thinking things like ""I'm bored and I want to smoke"", I'm going to just hop on Reddit and post my thought in the title and post the consciously reprocessed truth in the thread.

This way I will be teaching my mind new ways of thinking, which lead to new behavioral patterns that don't use smoking to solve perceived problems.

The goal is to stop using the faulty wiring that my brain has reinforced because of the loophole. And to form new connections that encourage healthier behavior.

I think I'm going to apply this to many aspects of my life. I'm coming to the conclusion that my whole personality has quite a few flaws that I need to work on. Going forward, I am going to apply this to everything I do.

I guess I could summarize this as leveraging self awareness to promote further self aware thought patterns and behaviors.

I think this is really going to be the best way to go about it.

I hope this works. I just smoked my last cigarette about 20 minutes ago before typing this up.",16

And it was harder to quit then then when I tried to quit cigarettes...

And I still know it's bad for me, a whole year later. But I want it. Really bad. Nicotine and sweets. But I'm smoke free for a year now and been trying to lost weight. 

But I really want it. I dont know what to tell myself to make me not want it because telling myself that I've been smoke free for a year and  it was so very difficult to quit.... is not helping at all.

Everybody who has read the Allen Carr book knows what is happening..I have to read the book once again.

I started smoking 1999. The first time I remember considering quitting was 2002 when I moved away from home for university. I was 19 years old. But eventually I didn't even try to quit. I was now living alone and I could smoke freely when while living with my mom I had to smoke in secret. (Of course I got caught numerous times and she was very angry finding out I smoke. Even though she was a smoker herself.)

2 years passed and I moved to another city, to another life. Thought of quitting cigarettes, because now I was starting med school! Oh, it was such a relief to find out many off my classmates smoke too, oh yes, great, I can continue the habit I thought. I was genuinely happy I didn't have to try to stop.

Then I thought I'll stop when I'm 25. Didn't even try to.  Then I decided to stop when I graduate and start working. Didn't even try to. When I bought my first home I decided to finally stop. Didn't even try to. Met a man who didn't smoke and didn't even consider quitting despite of his complaints about the way I smell :D Smoking in the bars and restaurants got banned, didn't quit, just went outside. One by one my friends quit. Even ""T"" who was the person I got my first cigarette from. She just quit and never smoked a cigarette since and was perfectly happy, no cravings, no longing for a smoke. My mom quit. I didn't.

I have worked in the ER and seen people in their forties die of subarachnoid hemorrage. I have seen people in their forties have a seizure and seen the lung cancer metastases in their brain CT scans and MRIs. I have seen patients suffering from severe COPD and patients with chronic ischemic wounds in their feet and legs waiting for amputation. Seeing these kind of things never made me consider quitting cigarettes.",2

I feel so good but I'm also fucking scared.,"I know to some, day 8 is not a lot. But I feel good right now and it's good because when you quit, you don't feel good for quite some time... (even if Allen Carr tells you otherwise).

On day 6, my neighbour offered me a cigarette while I was having a beer shandy and I declined without any sort of longing or regret. I just did and it felt good. It's such a weird and cool experience at the same time. Like wow, did I just decline a cigarette while having an alcoholic drink and I'm not even sad? 

Of course I still think of smoking and stuff but I don't feel like actually going out and buying cigarettes or throwing everything away, like a child having a tantrum. And that makes me feel relieved. Quitting is like walking uphill for what feels like ever and carrying an extra weight on your shoulders.

Sure, not everything has been a smooth ride but damn, when they say it gets easier, it really does. You won't believe it when you start out but the further you go... you just become sooo thankful and relieved.

Of course I'm also scared... I have to stay vigilant. So many people still slip up. It's still important to remember where you came from and the journey it took to get here. Nicotine is the devil's spawn and is always lurking. 

Anyway, thank you all for encouraging me, directly or indirectly. You guys really make a difference. I wish you all (and myself of course) continued success.",50

Lots of stress and the need for a stable state of mind renders me at a very tough spot. Previously, i thought that it was the angio-spasmic qualities of nicotine that serve as an anti-depressant/anit-psychotic agent for me but I've found that its just the moment and the action of smoking that gives me the peace of mind. I would stop entirely, and I have but the last couple of times I went cold turkey I realized how indispensable smoking has become for me as it has helped me a lot even at some point helping me through one of the toughest times in my life, keeping me docile when my life was nearly ruined due to a very bad mistake I made. However, the habit has gone out of hand and I'm dreading the possibility of having throat cancer now.

To be frank I need to stop smoking nicotine and to do that i need a substitute that will not kill me. It's that and it would be a nice bonus if it didn't smell/taste like death. Are there any options for this ?

P.S - Vaping made me realize that it was the smoking that I crave and it doesn't work.",1

Maybe this could be the key to quitting once for all, I know they are different things, but both have something in common, fucking with DOPAMINE inside of our brain. Just a thought, and since, I started smoking again, I quit for a month or so, because I couldn't take it anymore, I want to try to kill porn, and just go NoFap and see what will happen, since many people said that once they went nofap, they had more energy, and they were even more happy, and as far as I know, socializing was one of the main reasons always I smoked.  


Maybe it's utter bullshit that I'm talking about, but fuck it, I want to experiment with everything that I can, until I can fully get away from this shitty addiction. Carrs book didn't help ,I thought it did, but it didn't , so I have to change the bases of my mind, maybe it's all linked together?

I‚Äôm lucky in the fact I don‚Äôt have any of the negative side effects the only side effect I‚Äôve had is if I take the tablet without eating I feel a little sick.

I don‚Äôt know if anyone can help me, but, the majority of stats such as these: https://whyquit.com/whyquit/A_Benefits_Time_Table.html are usually based on 35 year olds who quit after 15 pack years.  I‚Äôm 24 and quit after 4.5 pack years smoking for 6 years.  Does it take as long to repair the damage as the above website says or because I‚Äôm younger and smoked for less, the damage is less and recovers quicker?

I‚Äôm also a bit anxious about COVID-19 and I hope what I have done has helped my chances of not getting as bad as symptoms if I continued to smoke.

I didn't smoke for long (around a year/9 months max) and when I did it wasn't heavy, around 2-3 cigarettes a day, sometimes more sometimes less. When I've tried to quit before I usually experienced the standard smokers flu and some pretty bad anxiety. Now, I've suffered with general anxiety disorder for a while however never experienced panic attacks and before I began quitting it was under control (using plenty of techniques learnt from therapy etc) . This attempt at quitting I didn't experience any anxiety only the mild smokers flu, 3 days ago however, I had the most vivid nightmare of my life and woke up with extreme anxiety, resulting in what I'm guessing was a mild panic attack (high heart rate, sweating, feeling like nothing was real/still in a dream or simulation, shaking and extreme anxiety). Ever since I've suffered with pretty constant/bad anxiety and this general feeling of being not quite right as well as the most vivid dreams ever. Obviously with everything going on in the world right now I'm quite stressed since I work in retail and will have to continue to work through the quarantine going on in my country so this could be that taking its tole however I'm not quite sure. I keep getting these thoughts of what if it's psychosis or if I'm going insane because I feel not quite right and it's all starting to get to me.

I also smoke cannabis regularly with tobacco mixed in so I'm wondering if the small amount of nicotine is keeping me on the edge of quitting and is the cause of my symptoms so late on? Either way I will be stopping smoking cannabis for a while to see if it will help and if I start smoking it again I won't be using tobacco with it as well. I'm also still experiencing other symptoms of quitting still even if only mildly such as light headedness, chest pains and a slightly tight chest which is what is making me think this might be related to nicotine withdrawals.

Has anyone here experienced such anxiety so late into quitting? Should I be worried? How long will this last? I am quite concerned as if it is not my nicotine withdrawal I'm worried it could be a pretty serious mental health issue of some kind that is in its early stages and so I want to deal with it as soon as possible.

Okay, so I quit smoking almost three months ago, during last December. I didn't even know it was my last cigarette. I was not a really heavy smoker (maybe 2 packs a week), but I did enjoy the ritual of rolling them up and all that jazz. The thing is, I got a really strong flu that lasted for a week and a half and I felt like shit, so not smoking for that long was really not a conscious decision. But when the flu went away I decided that I had had enough. The strong cravings lasted for three more weeks, and the more tolerable cravings are still somewhat present (but only during social situations‚Ä¶ which aren't happening anymore since I'm quarantined).

The benefits didn't take long to come. Barely a week after I recovered the ability to smell things I noticed that my clothes no longer smelled like tobacco. I didn't get out of breath so quickly. I was confindent getting close to people because I knew my breath wasn't going to annoy them. The list is as long as it is well known. It's worth it.

One day, about a month ago, I had sex with someone with whom I had only had sex while I was a smoker. This person told me my penis was bigger, which I assumed was due to them not having seen me naked in awhile. They were adamant that this was true, but I did not think much of it. Until I checked the (few) nudes I had taken during last year. And it was true. I don't know if I am allowed to post anything graphic here, so I won't. But the difference is so obvious I don't really know what to say. I did not expect such gains down there from quitting cigarettes.

Quit smoking. It's so worth it. Good luck everyone! Keep safe and strong during these difficult times!",66

I've been on before but said I'd be willing to try again.  I told every one I was quitting and my quit date of 3/18.  (sometimes I don't tell anyone in case i fail) my sister told me about Allen Carr's book Easy way to quit smoking.  I listened to it on the plane and a bit when i got back. I didn't get through all the book but I did get some things from the book. I think it helped me to understand I wasn't actually missing out on anything by quitting smoking.  I'm actually going to finish it this week for reinforcement. Some other things I think have been different for me is while I was preparing to quit was that I changed my mind frame from ""I'm quitting"" to ""I'm going to be a non smoker"".  Seems dumb, but I think that helped too.   I am now quit 6 days 1 hour and this has been a pretty easy quit.  Not one time have I had to talk myself out of buying a pack.

The good news is:  Your lungs will significantly improve 30 days after quitting, giving you a fighting chance against corona.

So quit today or die in a few weeks.

Just wanted to check in and vent/be honest/ try to be helpful to others.  I haven't had a cigarette in over 5 years.  I was a pack or two a day smoker, but was finally and happily able to quit in 2014.  A week or so ago I went to a friends house to help him prep some shit for COVID and what not.  He rolled a joint for the both of us.  Half way through it I realized it wasn't just pot in the joint, but I mix of rolling tobacco as well.  I got an instant buzzed and I loved it.  It scared the shit out of me.  I was ready to go buy a pack immediately and start smoking again.  I realize it's all this stress, but also that you are never really an ex smoker.  My brain immediately remembered the drug and the monster wanted more.  I have also been sober from alcohol for over a year.  I've been through a lot through the last two years, but it has been great doing it without cigarettes and alcohol.  I genuinely do not miss either, but the addiction is real, and it can creep back up into you very fucking quickly...so don't let your guard down.  I don't think I'll restart my counter, but if ya'll think I should, I will.

I'm a happy none smoker still, but since I had that joint the pangs are back.  I've dealt with it by working out, playing guitar, and talking with my very patient wife.

These are hard times, but smoke and alcohol will not make things go away or get better.  Stay vigilant, and thanks for listening!  Be well and safe",21

I went from smoking more than a pack a day 3 days to one a day but I don't know how I'm going to get through this. From everything I've read thyroid cancer has nothing to do with smoking, but what will it take to get me to quit?! Dying from lung cancer?

2020-03-23 17:15:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/fns55t/the_unthinkable_might_have_happened/,The Unthinkable Might Have Happened,"So, I'm 40 years old, and smoked during 25 of those years. Never even tried to quit, or entertained the thought that I could quit one day. Even on the day I was diagnosed with asthma, I did not thought I could or would try to quit. Every night I listened to the sounds coming out of my chest and still didn't want to quit. So, when my girlfriend asked when we can try to quit together I told her that I would probably need to take a week off of my work (and I only have 2 weeks of holidays throughout the year) and lock myself home without any cigarettes, a very very very unlikely scenario I thought to myself...

Well, then corona virus quarantine happened just like that. As far as I know I'm not infected, but we started to work from our houses. Didn't leave the house since last monday (the 16th).  On the 21st Saturday I finished my last pack of cigarettes, got dressed for going out to buy cigarettes. Then I realized, I could order everything online but cigarettes, and this is exactly the scenario I told my gf I needed to quit smoking. So, I watched Alan Carr's Easyway video and went cold-turkey, from about 30 cigs per day to nothing, after 25 years! And, incredibly: IT IS NOT THAT HARD.  I am even amused with myself, thinking I'm doing great without smoking and then reaching out to the table where my packs used to be. This happened like 20 times the first day :D

So it may be a bit too early (2 days, 5 hours since my last cig) but I am feeling excited about me being able to enjoy a smoke-free life. I am feeling maybe a bit more energetic and definitely more  positive with all the pandemic and self-quarantine thing going on since I haven't been smoking. 

I just wanted to put this out so maybe others can also be encouraged to turn their quarantines to something positive. Also, any heads up on what I should expect with my transformation would be appreciated. Boy, I hope this keeps working!",47

The after effects of the quit are prevalent. I've quit a few times before and I know how the lungs feel when they heal.  Being able to feel it and hear it when you take deep breaths. Since this virus is associated with pneumonia and respiratory issues, how is everyone handling their anxiety?  I am trying to normalize the quit as much as possible.  Doing what I need to do with taking care of myself. I did email my doctor and the respiratory symptoms are similar to how corona effects the body. She recommends quarantine (already following) water and tylenol when needed. Given I have no other associated symptoms, it could reasonably be from smoking, but no one really knows and that could very well change, so closely monitoring it. I do understand the risks are high and there is a possibly, but also I dont want to go crazy and make my self sick thinking worse case scenario either. I try to remind myself one day at a time. What I am experiencing is very normal after someone stops their cigarette intake. Withdrawl is hard on the body at any time. Keep my community safe in the meantime. Time will tell for me.

How many times you were short on money and you hated yourself for asking money to buy cigs ?

14 day ago I was in some of that cases, and I did pity myself bending over to one damn box, stinking, going broke month by month, getting worse stamina year by year, getting poorer erections, shorter sex duration, emptying bottle of perfumes one by one just to mask that really bad smell while your partner or your crush smells like flowers, seeing your teeth going yellowish day by day, your oral health overall getting worse, your veins suffering and your favorite food doesn't taste that good anymore, your favorite perfume don't give you that deep sensations and yet you just blame the manufacturer, even the damn orange juice doesn't taste that intense.

Do I miss smoking ? I wont lie, yes, yet in several month I know I will be thanking myself, in just 14 days I saved so much money I have no idea what to do, in 14 days all of those things going better one by one, whenever my urge hits I yell myself that I'm not that weak.

I won‚Äôt lie - it isn‚Äôt easy. But if you can get past the first day, you can get through the first week, then the first 21 days. And before you know it, you are well on your way to the new you - V2.0!


The things that I found worked for me during my early quit days are:
‚Ä¢ keeping myself distracted with kids/friends, hobbies (reading, baking, craft, or whatever took my fancy)
‚Ä¢ housework (that I found physically exhausting and lacked time and motivation for as a smoker), and can actually be fun when I wasn‚Äôt thinking about that ‚Äúnext‚Äù cigarette 
‚Ä¢ exercising - even a lazy walk around the block
‚Ä¢ the smoke free app or your preferred quitting app (testimonials, my own progress - that‚Äôs a no brainer!)
‚Ä¢ seeing all the money I was saving
‚Ä¢ feeling and looking so much better than I used to would stimulate me constantly 
‚Ä¢ treating myself (and my kids) to things I couldn‚Äôt afford as a smoker
‚Ä¢ distracting myself during cravings (as above) or even as simple as a glass of water 
‚Ä¢ eating properly/healthier will maintain a healthy mind to help cope with the mental and emotional effort
‚Ä¢ sleep - get enough quality sleep!

2020-03-23 00:38:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/fne1dq/end_of_day_1/,End of Day 1,"So, very spur of the moment for me. I wasn't planning on starting this quitting journey again, but yet here I am at the end of day 1. My wife and I have both been smokers our whole relationship, and while it's easier for me to turn one down, she's been smoking a bit longer than I have so it's harder for her to stop. Plus, she is a recovering addict so this is ""the lesser of two evils"" (10+ years recovery for her btw, since long before we met but I'm proud all the same). 

This morning, she had saved the last one in our pack for me to have when I woke up for work. So I had that one, but I didn't want to spend anymore money on buying another pack because of current events and the fact that I'm the only one working at the moment. A few months ago, we got 2 boxes of the starter kit for the patches, I used them for a solid week before (tmi) starting my monthly, and they made the pain 10000x worse and I could not continue using it. I was literally doubled over in pain, I could hardly see straight. Idk if anyone else has ever heard of this kind of reaction, but they work well for me any other time. Sadly, I gave up for a while. Since I had to stop using the patch to make the pain subside, I began having cravings again and continued smoking. Until this morning. Like I said, I didn't want to buy another pack, but I didn't wanna go all day without smoking a cigarette or having nicotine. Honestly, I just didn't wanna deal with the cravings. I ended up let her get a pack anyway, but still decided on wearing the patch because I had to leave for work cause I was already running late and wouldn't have one all day. I'm not proud of it, but my intention was to wear the patch to stop the cravings until I got home, and go from there (I know this is dangerous, and not how they're supposed to be used, but we all know we do stupid things when it comes to addictions like this). 

However, I decided half way through the day to just... keep going with not having a cigarette. Now, at the end of this day, I'm glad I decided to do that. I'm feeling really good and remembering how nice it was last time after almost a week and a half not smoking. I'm kind of excited to see if I can try again, and hopefully kick it for good. I know if I quit, it will encourage her to quit too! 

Tomorrow is going to be tough though. One of my biggest triggers is driving. There's just something about taking a drive and smoking a cigarette that really gets me, and tomorrow I'm taking an hour long drive to take a friend to a training session for her new job, and my wife will be with me, presumably smoking all day because she's not quite ready to try to quit with me. This will be a tough one, especially so soon after I decided to spontaneously do this. I'm determined to stick with it though.",7

2020-03-22 16:16:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/fn6djt/i_finally_no_longer_crave_nicotine_and_am_leaving/,"I finally no longer crave nicotine and am leaving this sub. This is a great community and I am extremely thankful for you all! Here are some things I've learned from my personal experience, if they can help anyone.","When you quit, what can you expect?

\- First week: This is where the physical cravings really hit. But if you can make it past the first day, then you can make it for any amount of time! The cravings become trickier over time, until they fizzle-out. I felt like my lungs were getting an insane amount of air. And I felt more alert a little after the first week. I could run up stairs, walk around quicker and sleep \*much\* better. Anxiety spikes around this point. And then begins to slowly decline. I was much less on-edge/tense and felt much more chill. Anxiety issues are exacerbated by nicotine. Nicotine does \*not\* help anxiety. 

\- First month: Around the month mark, most physical cravings are extremely light compared to how they were.  The cravings are much weaker whether you realize it or not! It's a very subtle but powerful decline. Psychological cravings and reasons you may used to smoke will become more apparent here. Food may begin to taste better here. And it may feel more rewarding to eat food and do other things. Your mind begins to return to your natural state! I was challenged by nicotine in thinking that I needed smoking to be social or productive, but in reality nicotine is what made me less of these things. Smoking is a weird feedback loop. It's almost like I would smoke to shortly relieve myself from the symptoms of the nicotine's effect on me. In reality, smoking resets all of the negative effects. Mood and any depression begins to improve, but it may also become more apparent. Exercise, meditation and cooking are all good ways to fight cravings. Nicotine tricks you into thinking it's the cure when really it's part of the problem! Chest tightness issues were almost absent for me here. My blood pressure was noticeably better here as well, because standing up and walking around didn't feel as weird.

\- First 3 months: Nicotine's grip has likely greatly loosened over the 2nd month. I was really not thinking about nicotine at all throughout the 2nd month and it felt amazing! I didn't know how much of my mind was centered around the next time I could smoke. It's extremely liberating. The 3-month mark may come with a huge burst of random physical cravings like from week 1, which by this point should have been gone for a while. I believe this is from something called an extinction event in psychology. Nicotine tries to put up one last fight and gives huge physical cravings. The psychological desire to smoke was extremely weak for me by this point though. So stick to what you've learned over the course of the past 3 months and stay busy! They don't really last more than a week. Things like colds and other viral bugs do not last \*nearly\* as long and the immune system works ridiculously better.

\- Beyond: The cravings really die down. I gained the willpower to tackle other things in my life. It is extremely liberating to finally not have cravings. I can look at someone smoking and feel okay. And I learned a good bit about myself in the process as well! It felt daunting at first to quit, and like I'd never go back to how I was before I took it up. But I did! There are times where it is not easy, but the reward is huge. 

&#x200B;

Every relapse adds extra desire to not smoke! Never beat yourself up about relapses. I personally relapsed a lot compared to most people. There is no reason to feel shame about it. If you relapse, try to get back on track ASAP. You have to convince yourself that nicotine is a toxic and foreign chemical. And that you deserve to be free from it. Any cravings are a result of smoking, \*not\* a result of not smoking. When you have a craving think of it as a result of taking up smoking, not the result of quitting nor nicotine's absence from your body. You can feel yourself heal over time and the cravings are part of the mind's way of resetting itself! 

I had a LOT of ""day 1's"" at the beginning and then lots of ""day 2's;"" then ""week 1's."" Every day without it is a huge victory.

Good luck to everyone in this community. Initially wanting to quit and deciding to is truly the hardest step.



Edit: There will likely be a spike in cravings at the 2 month mark that I completely forgot to mention. Like I said though, by day 60 you‚Äôll get through them! Using techniques picked up along the way and the desire to not smoke will carry you through.",675

2020-03-22 05:09:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/fmx29g/some_advice/,Some advice,"I am like al of you in the Corona quarantine. I also have exams next week, my mum is sick, my sister is depressed and got fired and can't pay for her house, which she supposed to move into on April first. My dad takes walks and comes home drunk. Sounds depressing and stressing right? It is. Nevertheless What I wanted to communicate is the following. Smoking doesn't relieve stress it causes it. The stress-relieving aspect of smoking only exists if you smoke. 

Let me elaborate. I had successfully stopped smoking for about a month at the beginning of this year, one social smoking session and I was on and off smoking. Threw half-full packs away in the morning, bought a new one in the evening.  The last couple of days while I was studying I couldn't concentrate in the afternoon, figured was need of cigarettes. Bought a pack, didn't do anything but chain-smoke for the rest of the day. Every moment I extinguished the cigarette the confidence boost went away, and again I couldn't focus. I was living in constant fear. Corona, I have Asthma btw, exams, sister, father, mother constantly coughing and refusing to see a doctor. My world was feeling apart, but smoking made me more anxious. I did not realize it though. 

Yesterday somebody mentioned this book: Allan Carr *the easy way to stop smoking*. Sounds ridiculous but trust me, this is the shit you need. I skipped studying, spend al evening reading that thing. I just felt an intense amount of joy. I realized why I was stressed, and why the cigarettes were the cause of the anxiety (becoming worse obviously) and not the answer.  I downloaded a free pdf on the book(pr illegally free not sure) but I am going to buy it regardless because I wanted to thank the man so much. 

More than that app that everybody uses here. That book inspired me. I felt intense euphoria while reading it, and I can honestly say I already quit. I freed my mind. I was dancing, jumping around in my room, didn't care about the exams. I can screw them up, Ill will pas them the next time. Nothing is more important than your health, so smoking to help the stress, which makes you more stressed is ridiculous. 

Please try to read it: the title sounds ridiculous, but you probably don't have to allot to do anyway, being Corona season. As I said you can find a free pdf. He even advises you to continue smoking while reading it. I finished the thing in a day. And I can not believe I have never heard of it. I sound like a salesman or some shit. But I was just jumping in the air while reading it. Finally understanding my anxiety. Looking back at old situations and realized while I felt the way I felt. 

I am writing this because I cannot stress enough how much reading that thing changed my mind. And it tragic that the author already passed, otherwise I would have contacted him personally to thank him. I suppose you could describe the feeling I am experiencing at this moment like an evangelist, for the stop smoking game. I feel like I need to share this with you.  I feel you al need to read it and I hope you do! Please finish the thing it only 100 pages, you can read it in a day. And feel like you ow yourself the more or less 6-9 of reading. What are 6-9 hours in a lifetime? Try it, please. And if you disagree with me, at least you tried! And you can do other things. But I think each and every one of you need to read the thing. Not stop halfway, not stop a passage you dislike. Read the thing, and you will feel like a man freed from the shackles of slavery. At least that's what I experienced.

23 hours and 27 minutes since quitting. Constant cravings. Constant! Not one minute without thinking of cigarettes despite chewing nicotine gum.

In the eighties smoking was still quite normal. There are photos taken in our living room with an ashtray on the table. I remember my parents smoking in our car and me telling them to stop, ""Awful smell! Close the window now, it is getting cold here!"". I said I would never start smoking, smoking is stupid. For some reason I remember well the cigarettes my mom smoked. The package was white and silver, shiny and beautiful. I remember the big beautiful ads, the Marlboro man, the ultrastylish Vogue and YSL cigarettes etc. All the adults smoked. My parents, my aunts and uncles, the friends of my parents.

I lit my first cigarette at the age 16. It was spring 1999 and the weather was exceptionally warm. I was hanging out with my friends (still in contact with all but one of them). We were drinking cider. Secretly of course, the age limit for alcohol consumption being 18 in my country. And there would be a BIG party later that night. Something very special. That kind of things did not happen often in our little village. One of my friends smoked, T, she had been smoking since 14 years old. My friend M impulsively told she would like to try. Ok, she tried. Then maybe me. All of us tried. It was fun and exciting. Maybe half an hour later we bought our first packs. And we smoked several cigarettes that night at the party. It was fun! And cool! Our classmates were a little bit surprised I think, maybe because we were the good kids, nice girls,. I don't remember being sick at all. But probably I didn't inhale properly, can't remember! What happened to the pack of 20 cigarettes can't remember either. Maybe I brought it home and hid it somewhere, truly can't remember!",10

I'm a long-time lurker of this sub and I like to come here to save ideas and references for when I decide to join the ranks of the former smokers. Well, for me, that time has come.

I've (33M) been (on average) a pack per day smoker since the age of 14. I endured a collapsed lung (spontaneous pneumothoraces) at the age of 17 and continued to smoke. I have quit a handful of times, at the most for a few months. Each time with the aid of nicotine replacement. Ultimately, I always fell back, mostly, due to an out of control drinking habit.

Having gained a lot of perspective and some control of other habits, and amidst the obvious health pandemic, I feel I have no more excuses to delay. I'm armed with an Allen Carr book and the steadfast support of my girlfriend and am anxious but ready. Any advice and encouragement is greatly appreciated as always.

Cheers.

I started at age 13 and quit when I was 26. Back on the 4th of October 2019 at \~5:00PM. I was up a ladder hammering in some tacks to hold a cable in place when all of a sudden my heart started malfunctioning. It felt like it was missing beats, then there'd be like 3-4 in a row really fast, then a gap. It was overall just really chaotic. I have had palpitations in the past but **this was different**. Of course I panicked hard and called 999. I ended up on my knees, thoughts rushing through my head. I was sure I was experiencing sudden death or cardiac arrest or something majorly serious. When the operator asked if 'the patients chest was cold to the touch', I gasped for air and screamed **""I am the fucking patient! Send an ambulance quick!"".** The fear you experience when you think you are seconds away from dying is so intense. You would do anything to live.  


In the end I actually had to get a taxi to the hospital because there were no ambulances available. Had an ECG taken in the A&E department. Saw a doctor who checked me out and said I was suffering with an ENT infection but didn't actually provide any sort of explanation for what I had experienced (the healthcare in England is absolute trash). Before the doctor let me go, she put a stethoscope on my back and asked me to breathe in deeply. She moved it across to the other side. ""Take another deep breath please""...She goes silent for a second. She looks concerned. She says ""Do you smoke by any chance?"". I answer yes. She books me in for a chest X-Ray.  


The went to bed that night convinced that I have a heart defect and lung cancer. I can't put into words the fear that I experienced and still experience to this day. I never smoked a cigarette again. If smoking even one cigarette means I am 0.0001% more likely to experience that heart stuff again then it's not worth it. I don't know why I typed all that out but I guess I needed to get that out.  


I wish you all the best in your quests to give up.",10

In my city in particular it is also forbidden to go for a stroll at the park alone, we have to remain in the perimeter of our houses. I'm stuck home with my mother (with whom I have a troubled relationship) for an indefinite time.
 
My personal situation: I have been smoking for 10+ years, min 20 a day. I have asthma since I was a child and this puts me in a vulnerable place with the virus spreading. I am also a singer. The stupidest breed you could think of. I have began to think I'm trying to mask some underlying issues with smoking, because for me It has always been a way to get out of uncomfortable situations or calm my nerves (when I could have acted/reacted). I stopped smoking for 2 years some while ago but then fell back in the trap. I did it with no help whatsoever, and it made me feel invincible. How? I had a good reason. I had to set some money aside to pay for a good music academy, monthly fee corresponding to what I was spending on cigarettes. I wish I could have that good reason again.

Since lockdown I have tried and failed many times to stop smoking. It seems like the right time because I know it's crucial for my health. Also I have a good routine set up, and I'm not exposed to temptations like people offering me cigarettes or drinks. I know that if I stopped smoking now I would get very snappy at my mother, and basically go crazy after not being able to even get out of here or take my dog for a walk. 

Have you got any advice for me? I already did it before so I know it can be done again. I'm sick of suppressing my full potential. I will surely use some CBT techniques and make a pro/con list so I can be prepared. Thanks in advance.",6

Now, with everything shutdown there is no more social outing to sneak a cig. And really, as an older dude I'm trying to keep my lungs as healthy as possible in case I catch this thing.

But god damn I could use a smoke right now. Whole thing is causing me a lot of anxiety. I miss that moment of calm when I step out and light one up.

But I know if I tried to only smoke just one right now, I'd end up smoking a pack of two a week at which point they wouldn't work anymore to calm me as they'd only get me back to ""normal"". It's just not a good way to deal with this situation. But god damn i could use a smoke right now.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the support. Yesterday night was particularly tough, but a good night sleep does wonders. I realize that I'm not craving the cigarette per se, but rather the feeling that comes with that first cigarette of the weekend when you're out with your friends. And well... smoking a cigarette now won't do that since I'll still be stuck at home. Problem is alcohol is a bit too easy right now as I want to numb my brain down a little, but drinking is what triggers my cigarette cravings. I'll have to get through this on my own, no more ""self medication"". Thankfully we can still go out for a walk.",71

I quit 60 days ago, 2 days ago I went to help a friend with their laptop since I tinker with things. I knew they smoked, but apparently they smoke indoors. So once I get inside I‚Äôm immediately hit with the all to familiar smell. Now granted it had been aired out before I came over as there was no smoke. However the very potent smell was there. So I fix the lap top, and grand total I was there for 1.5-2 hours. 

As I got into my car to drive away I could smell cigarettes. I sniffed my clothes, my arm, and my mustache. Everything reaked of it, and shortly there after I had a head ache come on. I remember thinking sarcastically I got second hand nicotine exposure from breathing all that and it soaking through my skin. I got home and washed my clothes and showered. That night, couldn‚Äôt sleep worth a damn so the next day I was exhausted and running on fumes and generally felt like crap. 

So today I woke up, and all day I have craved, and not the passing thought that I‚Äôm used to on the day to day. Literally full blown withdrawals and it has felt like my 3rd day of no smoking all over again. I‚Äôm irritated, my head feels fuzzy, I can‚Äôt concentrate, and I‚Äôve ate about a pack of ice breakers mints. So my question, did I basically just reset the withdrawal clock?",6

Parents don‚Äôt work and depend on me.. so more savings towards that.

He had a heart attack Monday and had open heart surgery yesterday. He's been heavily sedated and put on a ventilator. Because of COVID-19, I couldnt go in and see him. So I stood outside his hospital room, looking in through the glass, sobbing. I saw my dad, who has ALWAYS been the toughest guy I know, basically unconscious. I couldnt even see his face, and because he was sedated, I couldn't even talk to him over the phone. The nurse explained what was going on, but I couldnt tell you one word she said. My dad, my invincible dad, is at risk of dying. All because of smoking. We dont have heart issues in our family.

I had to write what could be my last words to him on a post-it note for the nurse to read to him. I'm a wreck.

He's in a room, alone, hooked up to multiple machines. We cant sit at his bedside and hold his hand. We cant crack jokes with him. He may not watch his grandchildren grow up. He may not walk me down the aisle in a few months. He may not be able to hold his wife ever again.

I quit before this happened. 8 days today. I've never been more motivated in my life.

Please, please quit smoking. If you've quit, you're doing a wonderful job, please keep at it. If not for yourself, for your loved ones.

So I'm about a month and a half in (what a hell of a time to quit!) and about 2 weeks ago or so I noticed that I often feel like I have to clear my throat, but I don't, if that makes sense? Like there'll be a sort of heaviness at the top of my chest, idk, it's bizarre. And the occasional cough, though I would say I definitely cough less now. Also my voice has developed a bit of a rasp.   


So I was wondering if this sort of thing lines up with anyone else's experience. All-in-all, I feel great! Just that weird sort of hanging heaviness, like maybe-i-could-clear-my-throat feeling that extends to the top of the chest, and a bit of a voice rasp.

I was up to over a pack of cigarettes a day at one point. After dealing with a lot of destructive trauma, it led me to using tobacco to cope. 

Proud to say that I am one week cigarette free today after quitting cold turkey. I‚Äôm 22 and smoked heavily for nine months - to a point where it caused a rift between me and those I loved. I often made a lot of excuses for my addiction, and I admit that temptations still linger. It has been quite hard - I have dreams where I am smoking, I miss having a cigarette as a form of instant relaxation, and as something that preoccupies me when I am doing something. I‚Äôve always been drawn to the aesthetic of smoking and to the feel of nicotine, which is quite hard to break. 

However, there are many positives:

‚Ä¢Although it is still recovering, as my sinuses are currently affected by the quit, my sense of smell and taste is infinitely stronger.
‚Ä¢I am beginning to find myself with a lot of energy. Last week was filled with lethargy, this week seems to be the week where I am more energized naturally than I have been in a very long time. 
‚Ä¢My breathing is becoming easier. I suspect this will become more easy with time.

Things I hope for in the future:

‚Ä¢The desire to smoke to go away or abate to a point where I am not extremely tempted.
‚Ä¢More smell and taste repair.

There are probably more things I can list, but they are not coming to mind right now. Thank you guys for all of the support.

climate change, my health, my Dad (who is a lifelong smoker currently ill with COPD), my upcoming PhD, saving money, and my mental health. 

I called the Texas quit line and set up my profile and have been chatting with coaches regularly. 

I‚Äôm using NRT patches and regular chewing gum. 

I have a TON of shit going on in my life:
-Full-time school
-graduation potentially cancelled
-as I mentioned, my Dad is very sick with COPD
-3 research jobs
-A very tumultuous relationship (my partner also quitting smokes and still addicted to marijuana). 
-myself quitting marijuana
-was recently sexually assaulted and hospitalized
-graduate school applications
-and of course, COVID-19 isolation 

This has been the most difficult thing in my life thus far. The emotional stress is overwhelming. My resistance to urges is a consistent 10/10, because I now know that it is truly now or never, and I have so much on the line. But the pain is still very visceral. Had my first smoking dream last night and I caught myself mid-first puff before throwing it out the window. I‚Äôm really proud of where my mind is at with this. No matter how bad it is/gets.

I poop about 2 times a week usually and I eat normally and not really unhealthy. I also put on extra weight veery easily because of that. I also exercise.

(Be careful with Day 7!),"After multiple attempts, I finally managed to quit smoking for good in April 2017. In retrospect, I think three things really helped me to conquer it in this attempt:

* Being stuck in life and really needed a change
* Having met and talked with someone who had quit for more than a year
* Encountering this book - Never Take Another Puff - that provided me with the physiological knowledge in quitting, so that I knew what to expect.

[https://whyquit.com/joel/index-ebook.html](https://whyquit.com/joel/index-ebook.html)  Here's a link where you can get your copy for free. I read it everyday and it really helped me to calm my nerves while having irrational urges.

What I found during the first week was that, I had a really strong urge to eat or smoke, so I let myself eat more instead of smoking. From the info in this book, I got to understand that, it is because nicotine raises your blood sugar level through mobilizing glycogen out of your liver. While in smoking cessation your blood sugar will be lower than what you've been used to, and there's a strong urge to raise that again through eating. Let it happen. It'll ease off in about a week's time.

Another observation is that, for the previous 4 or 5 attempts, I was always able to abstain for a week, but then get complacent, thought I had quit successfully, then have another smoke and boom I was hooked again.

In this picture you can see that, day 7 is particularly a tricky day. So maybe partially my reason for relapsing was my complacency, but it could also have something to do with the physiology of smoking cessation. Therefore, I suggest you to be extra careful with Day 7! Tough through it and the second week will be even more rewarding.",2
2020-03-17 09:34:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/fk5c43/relapse_and_advice/,Relapse and advice,"I've relapsed from smoking about three weeks ago. I had stopped for about 6 weeks. Going drinking did it, since then I've had days in which I did not smoke, and days in which I did. I've been trying to pin down what the cause is. And I've realized that obviously drinking is one, but stress also seems to be one. Currently, I am in quarantine as a consequence of the Coronavirus. Nonetheless, my professor stated that my exams will most likely be take-home exams, so I've been studying in my room for the last couple of days. I've been trying to quit smoking, but usually, at the end of the day I just loose al concentration and go smoke. I've been wondering, if the none smoking seems to negatively impact my studying, would it be smart to just postpone it a week until 25/03/20, which is the day of my last exam. Since I do seem to be able to focus a bit better after I give in to the smoking. But then again, smoking is obviously ridiculous bad for my health, so there's that. 

What do you guys think? Btw, I am aware of the negative impact of smoking on people who get Corona, but as of the moment, I am not sure what to do. Some advice would be appreciated!

The longer I don't smoke the better I'm feeling about my lung health in regards to coronavirus which is making it soooooo much harder to resist cravings. 
I'm in my third year of university and the uni has closed for the whole year, I was expecting it to close until after easter but not FOREVER! There are so many people I won't see again now and couldn't say a real goodbye to and the near future is so uncertain - I felt so low today I went to see a friend who I used to regularly smoke with and fought a hard battle against my cravings and brain telling me to take my old baccy pouch 'just incase' I was so stressed and upset I 'needed it' and felt I deserved it because my life was falling apart. But I thought of this group and how there were so many people just like me who had resisted the same thing and I had seen posts where people were so proud they had resisted these cravings. Now I'm one of them!!! To any of you struggling at this really extremely stressful time YOU CAN STILL BEAT THE CRAVINGS! Right now I feel amazing and in control - and I dont have to reworry about not being healthy with coronavirus around because i stuck to my guns and have really achieved something here! To all of you who feel the need to light up in these ever changing times smoking is not the answer and you'll feel so much better for resisting!! 

Thinking of everyone in the world right now! We are all in the same boat and can get through this together! Just think once all this is over other cravings will be so petty in comparison!

As an aside - I know the changes to my life are minor compared to the lifestyle changes many people are going to face but all is relative and these cravings are universal - GO US!!",34

I haven't heard it said here yet so I'm assuming it might be a bit controversial.

I had been smoking since December 2011. My dad is a smoker and his dad had been one before him. I hated smokers. Before I started I was the most annoying anti-smoker my smoker friends could tolerate. But then I got depressed. Even suicidal, and I had the weirdest cocktail orlf reasons to try smoking. I wanted to start, and then quit and show people it wasn't so difficult. I was at a stage in life where I felt I could never live upto my dads expectations or that I could ever be as disciplined and focused as him, I wanted to do the one thing he never could, quit smoking. I wanted to see if it really helped me relive tension as I'd heard a lot from my dad and his friends (albeit they always said it jokingly).

And then I started I hated the taste and it did nothing for me and made me sick but I made myself stick to it until I could smoke with the best of them. I cringe at my state of mind then but i can't change who I was then.

Coming to the point I wanted to make, once I was smoker my circumstances changed, I got to a more stable place mentally I realized I could still run exercise my lungs were not too damaged and I tried to quit. But I couldn't. I went cold turkey, failed, then tried to tone down gradually,failed at that again. My friends helped, i knew all the tips and self righteous sermons I'd given to smokers over the years so none of those worked.

I wanted to focus on my healthier future and that helped for a bit but then I failed again. Each time I felt my physical dependency felt like it stayed long after the withdrawal symptoms had faded...

And then I got to the point where I hated myself constantly, I had promised my fianc√© that I'd quit by the time we were married and here I was smoking three years into our marriage.

So for our third anniversary I decided I'd make no dramatic decisions no promise rings or badges or trophies. Just mark 100 days. On our anniversary it wouldn't be a gift or a grand gesture but just a footnote. A marker. I even told myself I'd go back to smoking after the anniversary then try again later... But then I did start toning my consumption down before the start of the 100 days. First I stopped buying packs, your friends can lend you a smoke here or there but eventually either they keep ""running out of smokes"" around you or you learn and stop asking folks. Eventually even in social setting I would ""borrow"" only a puff. I got to a hunderd days smoke free 20 days in advance. and then I didn't tell her.

It wasn't a favor to her per say so I didnt feel like using it as even a mild gesture. After all I was only fulfilling a promise albeit delayed.

I have to be honest, I'm still not smoke free in the purest sense of the word. While I've been counting down the days since my last complete cigarette there have been puffs in the middle. And ofcourse I truly mean one or two puffs once per major gathering for old times sake, not 5 puffs from 6 people at one session, each puff has actually helped me remember how much i hated the taste before I had starred. By my measure I'm nearing 6 months cigarette free. By a purist measure i quit 5 hours ago as I ran into an old smoking buddy today who was gracious enough to share a puff of his last cigarette before he has to stay home with his wife who would murder him for lighting up. I take full responsibility for my actions but the guy ripped his cigarette in half and handed me one half... You know because Corona. And who knows it could be the last time I see him. 

While I'm sure many would rightfully point out that I have a major gateway open to relapse, my only counter to that is that the ""not another puff"" approach already led me to three lapses in 8 years. I would think and overthink the idea and end up hyping myself up so much that a single puff or a single lapse would make me so dejected that I'd say screw it and end up in going back to a pack a day within weeks.

I'm very happy I ""quit"". But to stay consistent I under hyped my milestones at each step so it ended up weakening the impact of any of my setbacks as well.

And I think that's the point of my essay, setbacks can come and having to reset that clock is not failure. Failure would be to give up on yourself. Anything you do to help you not give up on yourself has to be progress.",0

(Anyone who has read his war memoirs will see a reference to smoking on almost every other page.)

When Spike was 34, he suffered a nervous breakdown caused by overwork (on the ""Goon Show"", a BBC radio comedy). He was taken to St. Luke's mental hospital in London:

>""A doctor gave me a jab of something and in ten seconds I was unconscious."" He says he remained in a drugged state for fourteen days, though he was woken occasionally to drink some liquid food ‚Ä¶ ""One good thing,"" [Spike] adds, ""I was a heavy smoker and being unconscious for two weeks had abated the craving ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never really smoked since.""

Spike died at the age of 83 in 2002.

Reading the above story gave me an idea; I have set myself a challenge not to touch nicotine for two weeks, and made myself a little calendar to mark the days as they go by (a simple tick-off list in my notebook). Two weeks doesn't seem *too* long, but it also seems that it might *just* be enough to break the stranglehold nicotine has on me. I'll post back here in the comments in two weeks to let you know how I'm getting on.

Well, here it is! I am 70 days free (I had to check because I don‚Äôt really keep track). I‚Äôm feeling great!

1. I DO NOT feel deprived, I feel pretty normal. Good days, bad days, COVID fears. Normal. I just don‚Äôt smoke.

2. I can and have had alcohol without caving or even wanting to. 

3. I enjoy coffee still, maybe more. 

4. I‚Äôm not bored because I can‚Äôt smoke. Smoking was a huge inconvenience. Even when out with friends. It was always a hassle and stunk so bad!

There are many many more, but you get the point. I seriously thought about smoking/quitting ALL day at first. Now I can truthfully say there are whole days where it doesn‚Äôt even cross my mind.

 I'd normally soak my cigarettes and chunk them, then if I ever craved one, I'd have to buy a new pack. But, that didnt work. I'd get mad until I caved and spent more money. I'm the type that hates cake, but if you tell me I cant eat cake, I crave it and will have to eat it.


So, what has worked so far is I have 2 cigarettes and a jar. Everyday I don't smoke, I put 50 cents in a jar. I can smoke the cigarettes if I want, but if I do, I have to give my husband the money.... which hurts more than literally dumping the money in the trashcan lol


Also, hes been great about helping me through the craving anxiety messes. He goes through the U.S states and asks the capitals, and since we dont know many.. we then go through math problems.


The encouraging fact is seeing my money add up, and KNOWING I have those two cigarettes.. but choosing not to smoke. I'm excited to spend the money on something fun!",11

&#x200B;

I posted a few weeks ago here, being all helpless. And you all answered with much care and love, you also shared some tips. I gave in that time but since last Monday I haven't smoked! the first days weren't easy but now I'm feeling quite fine. I do 30 to 40 minutes of low impact cardio everyday, and eat at a caloric defecit not to put on weight (I actually was midway through a weight loss journey, I didn't let the hand-to-mouth reflex get me back into the habit of binge-eating). 

I have to be honest and admit that I have been back to my parents' since last Monday and I obviously cannot smoke here plus, as I was traveling from a city with covid-19 outbreak I am in home - isolation, so I'm pushed into both eating less and not smoking at all but still I'm so happy I've come this far.

The smoking withdrawal symptoms can make you anxious nowadays too, as they are similar to a flu and could be thought of as covid-19 too but you should chill and know that the sore throat or the coughing are caused by your lungs cleaning themselves. I'm no expert of course, if you are concerned do your research or talk to your physician.",28

A bit of background :- 
When I was 16 years old I smoked my first cigarette, the next one was around a year later then the one after that was a few months later. Slowly the gap between each cigarette I smoked decreased. It went from months to weeks then to days and last years it was only 1 or 2 hours before I had an other smoke. 
At the end of last year I finally realised that I had a problem. Before this I used to tell my self that ""I could stop whenever I wanted but I'll just light one more cigarette and then stop"". 

Since last December I  have been trying to quit but failing time and time again. The only thing l have to show for my progress is that I went from smoking 9-10 time a day to 4-5 (on a bad day) and 2-3 (on a good day).

Last month I have had been in a loop of sorts, I will try to quit,  get irrationally angry or depressed, convince myself that I can smoke one more cigarette,  buy a pack, smoke 1 or 2  cigarettes, feel really guilty of what I just did, throw away the pack and go cold Turkey after a day or half a day this cycle will repeat.

I really don't know what to do now. No matter how hard I try I end up smoking and feeling worse about it.

I really don't know what to do.",5

Quitting in a time of grief...,"I recently quit smoking in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that‚Äôs breaking out globally. I‚Äôm 22 and from the US, and have only been smoking for nine months. However, those nine months of smoking were pretty heavy. A lot of it has to do with a grief that I experienced last year that truly prompted the heavy smoking into high gear. At one point, I smoked over a pack a day but later dialed back as it was too much for me.

The depression is intense. Being inside all of the time is really hammering the loss and grief in. All I want to do is sleep. In addition to wanting to sleep, I am emotionally exhausted and physically fatigued. All I can really do is think of what has happened and it‚Äôs amplifying my crying jags for quite a while. One upside to this is I tend to sleep through my cravings.

Everything and anything is a task to do. I‚Äôm lucky if I get out of bed for a period of time in the day. Literally nothing is interesting to me anymore. I feel very flat, anhedonic in a lot of senses. Sleeping helps make that go away.

The depression makes me less hungry, if one can believe that. I do not eat as much as I used to, but that could also be from wanting to save as much food as possible in times of the pandemic. 

I am also very lightheaded. The lightheadedness comes and goes, but I tend to find myself more lightheaded than not - especially when I am trying to do things that use up energy. 

I do want a cigarette, but I feel like at this point I am putting myself deeply in harm‚Äôs way if I have one. I miss cigarettes badly. I miss a sense of normalcy. I hate grieving and I hate this pain that‚Äôs coming back. That‚Äôs part of the reason I kept smoking in the first place.

Any help appreciated!,"So 8 days ago I decided to quit smoking. I've been using a 15mg 16 hour patch (the appropriate one for my smoking) every day so far and thanks to those I believe it has made my experience much less stressful.

I have, however, been experiencing some on-off "" flu like symptoms"". Like weak and achy muscles, sneezey, scratchy/lump in throat. They are confusing the hell out of me. All of the symptoms have been intermittent, one day they'll be mild or practically non-existent and the next (like today) they'll come out of nowhere.

They even come and go at any point in the day. That's why I'm convinced it's not an actual flu/cold.

Are these withdrawals? Side-effects from the patch? Are these signs that my body is getting rid of toxins? I find that many websites detail the process of quitting purely from a positive angle but there is only vague one word information on potential symptoms and side effects.

&#x200B;

Id would be great if someone else can share any similar experiences they've had to me. As I said, it's often made apparent that only positive things happen from the moment you stop smoking.

Just a couple hours ago i decided to smoke 1 cigarette just out of curiosity of how it would feel like after such a long time (before this I've only been able to not smoke for at least 2 days before relapsing each time. I did quit for a month once but that was way back when i had just gotten into smoking for a couple months and probably smoked 2-3 a day at that time so i don't usually count that quit attempt)

Here is what happened. I planned on smoking 1 whole cigarette but just after 1 drag i was coughing my lungs out. After coughing for like 30 seconds i took another huge drag and inhaled it and instantly felt nauseous. Just goes on to show that over the years cigarettes had numbed my senses to such a degree and had manipulated my brain so much with all the nicotine it injected that i completely ignored what it was doing to me and how shit it actually tastes. For some reason i always use this example: Consider smoking to be like being in a really toxic relationship for a long time. You know you have to breakup but all the time invested, the memories and how in some way it felt good but it actually wasn't for your mental or physical health but once you do you realize how much freedom you have and what you were missing out on in life. For the first few days/weeks you'll really miss what you just left and may even want to get back to it which is only because your brain reminds you of that 1 good memory that made you feel good and overlooks the 99 other bad memories. And if you do get back into that relationship again just a few days in or even instantly you'll start to regret what you've gotten yourself into.

After 2 hours of those 2 drags i can still assure you i smell like shit. If i had been still been smoking i wouldn't habe even noticed the smell after a few minutes.

My name is Shel. I recently became a stop smoking professional from NCSCT (National Center for Smoking Cessation and Training ) in the U.K.after completing the online training courses.

I wanted to launch this campaign called ""My Last Cigarette in 2020"" to encourage all smokers to quit smoking in 2020.

Before I finally quit after so many failures, I had come to peace in a way. I had given up. I realized that because of smoking, I would the rest of my life in pain. I would die earlier than I was meant for. I would always be hiding the extent of my self destruction from the people who loved me.

It's probably worse now than at the start. I was under the impression this stuff would happen earlier on not so late. The first week I was angry, and I couldn't sleep too well. It was mostly problems with mood. Now I'm having physical problems that are really intense and my mood is even worse (but in week 1 I was pissed off and cranky, in week 4 I am in despair and exhausted but hopeful)


1) My sense of taste and smell returned in the past few days, smells are overpowering and often disgusting. I can taste the inside of my throat and it tastes awful and making me feel sick. I'm getting really intense smells but in an unpleasant way that even make me feel anxious because of how potent they are. Imagine a piece of cheese you normally can't smell? That smells like a thousand filthy socks to me atm, from across the room. It would make me gag. I walk into a room and I'm like what the FUCK is that smell. If there's 1 piece of old food under the sofa I will smell it. It's absurd. I couldn't smell shit before. 


2) The back of my nose and inside my throat/lungs has gone overdrive on mucus production in the past week. Basically I have to clear my throat constantly and swallow mucus all day, and when I lay down for bed the mucus is going down my throat all night. It tastes pretty bad as you can imagine. I wake up feeling VERY sick. I think this is post nasal drip and it may be contributing to the stomach issues. It's like swallowing probably a litre of the stuff per day. 


3) My bowels are rebelling, and inconsistent. Sometimes it's like I'm not even digesting food and I get intense bloating. Sometimes I get discomfort when things start up again and I have mix of constipation and diarrhoea. I get nauseous when I need to go and it feels like my insides are struggling, I don't think the mucus helps digestion.


4) Sleep has been terrible since day 1, I'm very sleep deprived. Everything is really intense and overwhelming. I feel colder when it's cold,when it's warm I feel boiling, every noise is amplified, pain is worse than usual, I'm much more easily scared. Probably sleep deprivation is making things more uncomfortable because my brain can't process shit normally but every sense feels exaggerated toward the negative and it's quite unbearable. I can't think straight because of how tired I am. I had a better night sleep last night and I think this is what I need the most. The longer I struggle with sleep the harder it is to sleep because I start having major panic attacks due to fucked up perception and not being able to calm myself down. Yesterday I slept long and only woke up 3 times (that's good compared to not falling asleep until 4am, then waking up at 6am having a panic attack).


Fortunately I have got sick time off work, they were understanding and I can have no pressures for 2 weeks.

Do you think by then things will have settled? I feel awful.",8

I am on nicotine patches after vaping 5% nic for about 4 years and I can say that, although its quite unusual to not be vaping but still be satisfied, it is working really well. It's only been about a week, but I feel like I have a lot more energy and my lungs feel amazing. Basically I was wondering how the nicotine withdrawals would compare to quitting cold turkey once I get down to Step 3 of the patches.. Is it less intense?

I‚Äôm on day 3 (almost exactly hour 72 as I‚Äôm writing this) of my most successful stop in quite some time, and I thought I went and caught Corona. Of course, coughing, sore throat, malaise, (NO fever) and anxiety are all signs of the body clensing itself of all the crap I‚Äôve been sucking into it. Not corona, but I really freaked myself out for a while. 

That was the main reason I stopped‚Äîthe coronavirus. At some point, I bet one of my friends that if the virus hit my home state, I would stop cold turkey, then and there. And it did, so I did. And actually, it‚Äôs been a very effective deterrent. 

The last few failed attempts, I‚Äôd make it 24 or 48 hours and feel like that proved I *could* quit if I ever *needed to*. But at the moment, I never actually needed to. Obviously I wanted to stop, but there was never a good enough reason (I used to vape, not smoke. Even with the mounting evidence vaping causes COPD, hypertension, heart disease, etc., I never found those compelling reasons to stop. I think Alan Car talked about how the health angle rarely works too, but it‚Äôs been a while since I read *Easy Way*)

Anyway, I just wanted to vent somewhere about how proud I am of myself, and about how hard it‚Äôs been. I‚Äôve never had anxiety this badly before, but I‚Äôve never been ‚Äúoff the weed‚Äù for so long either. It‚Äôs hard to tell if it‚Äôs my body revolting now that there‚Äôs no nicotine left in it, or if I‚Äôm really just this worked up about COVID. I dunno. Either way, it gives me an outlet so I can think to myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not anxious because I want to vape; I‚Äôm anxious because X people in my area are sick‚Äù. Its scary, but it works. 

And the difficulty of this quit is one of the things solidifying that it will be permanent for me. I really can‚Äôt go through all of this anxiety again, and I really need to stop using nicotine. So I can‚Äôt turn back now. To do so would be to lose 3 days of progress. 

Supposedly I‚Äôm over the hump now. From here out the withdrawals subside, and I keep thinking about two things from *Easy Way* that keep me grounded. 

>I‚Äôm killing the nicotine monster in my belly. Don‚Äôt let him trick you. It‚Äôs wonderful to be a non-smoker

It‚Äôs helpful to think of vaping as a foe to defeat, and it is wonderful to be done with it!


>If you got a cold you wouldn‚Äôt sit around moping. You continue with your life and it goes away with time. 

Just because the world is hectic and scary right now, doesnt mean I get to shut down and give up on quitting. Keep moving, and eventually being a non-smoker will be as normal as it is for everyone else. (Maybe if you get a cold right now though, stay home..)

Sorry for the rant! Just had a lot to get off my chest. I always feel better when I can set my thoughts in writing.",3

I (late 20s, male) stopped smoking on Feb 20, cold turkey (after 6 years, 30 cigarettes a day). Later on (day 12), someone pissed me off very BAD and I did what I wasn't suppose to do: I smoked one cigarette! I hated myself so much. I could feel I have smoked, even one day after that.

I reset my quit calendar to zero but didn't let it go. I had heard from a friend that you shouldn't have a slip but if you do (remember: ""not another puff, no matter what""), make sure to stop it there.I did so, I reminded myself of the night that I wasn't able to sleep because of chest pain (withdrawal symptom (I checked with my doctor as well)). I'm not going to forget all the pain I've experienced. I have done most of the parts, so I have to push through. **I WILL NOT LET MYSELF DOWN!**

I go running and biking to fight cravings. They don't last long. Running provides your body Dopamine that it needs (nicotine does the same (in an addictive way, by giving you cancer and heart attacks)).I run 2 hours a day. I am even thinking of running seriously again. I'm planning for a Marathon (If COVID-19 disappears). I did half-marathon when I was a smoker. After finishing the HM with a good time, I smoked a cigarette to celebrate!!!

I love being smoke-free and I will not go back. Please you do the same.",7

It isn't.,"I first quit smoking in September and throughout my husband's surgery, my cat getting ill, my mom finding out she has cancer and writing 120 pages of my PhD thesis I stayed strong. 

And then for no other reason then me being a fucking moron i started smoking again in the middle of February. So, yeah, here I am again, about to reach 48 hours without smoking and just feeling complete helpless and vulnerable. Again.

I guess for the first time I really understand the whole ""We admitted we were powerless over nicotine"". Quitting doesn't get easier the second time like I hoped it would, I feel just as powerless and empty as I did the first time and know I just have to live through this until it gets better. 

There is not really a point to my post, I just wanted to vent.

I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs almost been a month. I‚Äôd been wanting/trying to quit since December and after way too many attempts than I care to admit, I‚Äôve finally done it. I finished Allen Carr‚Äôs book which helped changed my mindset completely around smoking and I‚Äôve been using the patch for now. I tried cold turkey for 2 months and rarely made it past day 2 so I felt like I needed to try something different to succeed and the patch along with a new mindset has done wonders for me. 

One of my biggest struggles while trying to quit was no longer smoking on my breaks/lunch at work. I know we all get used to that routine. Moments of stress at work and feeling lost without that routine led me to cave in several times. Once I decided I‚Äôm quitting for good it was weird to adjust to for the first week or so but now I enjoy my breaks and free time so much more. I‚Äôm no longer rushing outside to smoke or rushing to the gas station to get cigs on my lunch break without having time to just pause and relax for a minute. I also pay a lot less attention to the time now and my day tends to go by faster because I‚Äôm not watching the clock waiting for my next smoke. It‚Äôs such a relief and I‚Äôm realizing how so much of what Allen Carr said is true - that smoking really did add additional stress into my life and wasn‚Äôt the stress reliever I thought it was for so long. 

I‚Äôve had the month/year from hell. My grandma passed and my family had to put our dog down in the same week in January, and I‚Äôm going through a divorce from my abusive ex who continues to stress me out 2 years after we split. At a time like this, I would normally be smoking, clinging onto any distraction from all the stress and anxiety I‚Äôm feeling. But I‚Äôm not and it feels so good to be taking care of myself and do something for me. I‚Äôve learned that quitting smoking doesn‚Äôt have to be this miserable experience where I feel like I‚Äôm depriving myself of something, which is how I felt with every quitting attempt before this. Quitting was always so hard for me but this time around I just feel relieved to be free of that struggle and so proud of myself. I just wanted to thank this sub for all the support - seeing so many people who have made it so far was/is so encouraging to me and if you‚Äôre still trying to quit, you can do it! I know that sounds really simplistic for something that is such a struggle especially at first but you‚Äôve got this! ‚ô•Ô∏è",14

I‚Äôm 1 month, 5 days without a puff and I‚Äôve recently stopped taking champix.

I've been smoking since 18 and I am now 26, but always on and off. I definitely smoked the most until I was 23, less than half a pack a day and then refused to buy packs, would casually smoke at parties and bum off friends.

In the last three years I've noticed that I've been experiencing chest pains that last for a day or so, just genuinely feeling tight and gross, dull pains like a sitting weight on my tender lungs. I thought it was GERD for the longest time, went to a pulmonologist last year and my lungs were fine, X-Ray, breathing test, etc.

I'm not proud to say but I still smoke from time to time, stress in graduate school and life encourages this shitty addiction. But I fucking hate it. I went to a retreat this week and had maybe less than 6 cigarettes this weekend and now my chest just feels like it's on fire. 6 cigarettes and I feel like I smoked a whole pack. I feel like garbage knowing that I've been slowly killing myself for the past years, pretty freaked out at the ides of my lungs possibly having black spots as well....

**Do you guys experience this chest pain as well?** I feel like my lungs can't tolerate this as well when I was younger. I've been told that this a sign to quit completely. I feel like colder weather makes it worse.I have friends that smoke and when I ask them if they experienced these chest pains, they look at me funny and can't relate.  I am done smoking as of this weekend, I no longer believe this is a route I'd like to take considering this perpetual feeling and stories from this subreddit.

I've quit two different times for around a month and a month and a half.

Seems life is harder to navigate without smoking. 

I realise smoking doesn't help and my life isn't good when I smoke, but I feel more stable without much mood swings when I do. 

I also realise this might seem like an excuse to keep smoking, but I do believe quitting smoking is harder if you have mental illness ( unfortunately I also have social anxiety and ocd). So any advice from people in the same situation would be great.

I've tried cold turkey quite a few times, always ending up relapsing. My longest recent streak is about 10 days. 

When I was 17 I smoked for a little while as well but only because I thought it was edgy and I didn't even enjoy it so it was easy enough for me to quit. 

In the past year I've been through a hella lot of stress due to death and mental illness in the family and picked up smoking again (23 now). Mainly because it felt like a good way to relieve the stress (probably placebo or the nicotine that makes me feel better) and I generally enjoy it now (the menthol ones though, which will be banned in the EU very soon, still hate the normal ones).

So as I tried quitting a few times, cold turkey all the time, I've noticed that it was just too hard on me.

So now I'm trying a new strategy, limiting myself to 3 cigarettes a day for the coming 2 weeks before going cold turkey entirely. I've decided on this because I know based on my experience that I can easily go without a cigarette for about 4 hours without it affecting my mood too much. (When commuting, or during a long lecture I can't go out and smoke).

So I'll be spreading my smokes with 4 hour intervals that way I won't immediately feel the negative side effects of quitting cold turkey while adapting my body to getting less nicotine. Of course if I don't feel the need to smoke at all after 4 hours I won't just light one up for the sake of smoking 3 a day. 

During those two weeks till the last cigarette I'll figure out what works better to achieve the same calmness as a cigarette and what triggers me to smoke a cigarette. For now mints, chewing gum and sudoku's are among my replacements. The mints give me something to do with my mouth and the sudokus keep me distracted from smoking while also increasing my focus. 

So that's it. 2 weeks of cutting down before going cold turkey entirely.

If you have any advice or experiences with similar strategies feel free to comment.",9

The hardest part was the 3 days before I started the patch. I quit cigs and switched to a vape thinking that would work. All I did was get way too much nicotine and still felt like something was missing. Once I gave that up and started my day count on the patch, I felt a relief knowing that it was moderated but it was still quite difficult. The first 4-5 days were tough but easily doable. When I stepped down from 21 to 14 I didn‚Äôt feel a difference. Same from 14 to 7. When I had to switch from 7 to 0 I was super scared but I barely even noticed. I‚Äôm now 12 days off everything and I feel totally fine. 

Just to reiterate, the hardest part was going from cigs to vape. I would just quit it all together and go to the patch. Also the first few days on the patch were tough so I just chewed a bunch of sugar free gum. 

I highly recommend the patch. I also recommend Allan Carr‚Äôs easy way even though I didn‚Äôt exactly follow that particular path. It‚Äôs a good motivator. You can order the book, chewing gum and the nicotine patches on amazon (do it now!!üòú) Thanks for everyone‚Äôs support!",3

24 year old that has been vaping nicotine regularly for the better part of 8 months now and I generally kill a stig/posh/pod in a 24 hour period. I've tried quitting many times the last few months but I just can't. 

My main problem is that **I DON'T WANT to quit**... I know I should, and **I want to want to quit.** My subconscious and brain simply likes it too much. It's nice having something to look forward to every few minutes and pass the time. I am only 24 and vaping for 8 months so I am not at the point where I need to quit, yet. 

I've tried cold turkey, the only problem is I own my own business and quitting cold turkey severely hurts my energy/productivity to the point where paying my rent could become a problem.

I've also tried stuff like tea vapes and b12 vapes, but the vapor inhaled by that isn't comparible to that of a stig or posh and obviously there's no nicotine so there's no buzz.

Anyone have any success stories you could recommend to me?",3

I started when I was 15 (31 now) sneaking one or two here or there from her. 

I didn't smoke a lot compared to her (~1.5packs a week vs her 4+ packs a week)

Last month she was having breathing troubles and was admitted to the hospital. They identified a mass in her lung. Few weeks go by with scans and whatnot and I was still smoking.

She got admitted to the hospital again and over the course of like 4 days she could no longer breath on her own. Didn't find out results until that point, she had Small cell lung cancer. 

She was to be transferred to hospice care but I knew deep down she wasn't leaving that room. When the time came to remove the CPAP machine she was pumped full of morphine but a few seconds after removing she couldn't breath and tried to get up, I held her hand watching her suffocate. Took over an hour before she finally passed. 

I know she was most likely not conscious at all but it looked absolutely painful and it will probably scar me for life.

She passed on 2/24 and I've had 4 cigarettes since. I bought some vape thing to help with the  transition. There is no way I want to have my loved ones watch me die like that.",3

I remembered it today and since i'm quitting again (and hopefully the last time) i'll make sure i use it properly. 

So the deal is basically just take a hit of smoke. BUT don't inhale it into your lungs, keep it in your mouth. close your eyes and give full attention to it. let it sit in your mouth as long as possible, you can breathe through your nose, move the smoke around with your tongue, like you're trying to taste it. if you try it, let me know how long you managed to keep it there. By not inhaling into your lungs and keeping it in your mouth you can fully taste and smell the amount of chemicals you're blasting into your lungs with every puff, which you normally can't taste when directly inhaling. I personally felt sick every time i've done that, there were some people to whom it done nothing, but i think they were either acting it out or not doing it right. 

If you implement this little trick into every cigarette you light, you will be able to do it. I personally made a deal with myself back then, that i would let myself smoke, but i had to do this with every cigarette in the first three puffs i took. That was my price for smoking it. Never finished the whole cig after, and eventually it disgusted me completely.",17

After I started smoking, people started to comment or ask why their was no hair on the top of my head. I shrugged it off and didn't realize what they were even talking about, at that time I kept my hair pretty short and figured it was just a small bald spot.

One day, after a few more comments, I finally took a hand mirror and looked at the top of my crown and to my shock, I was almost completely bald in that spot. I hadn't noticed it, and as my hair started to get longer it became even more apparent. I chalked it up to genetics and ended up using a product to fill it in. Also, over time this ""spot"" has gotten to the size of a drink coaster, if you want a reference for how much was falling out.

Well, for about a 2-3 month span after about 7-8 years of smoking, I was able to quit, and I checked my hair in between because I'd heard that smoking/nicotine can restrict blood vessels and impede hair growth. I took photos of the top of my head, and compared them weekly. It was starting to grow back, after 7-8 years of thinning/baldness, it was actually growing back and filling in. I was ecstatic! Then I picked up smoking again...and it went back to how it was.

Now, I'm quitting again. Today. I'm weighing out the benefits, and throwing this into the pile. If you have noticed your hair thinning or losing it's luster, or even falling out, it just might be the cigs.

Now I am smoking 5-7 a day. I really need to quit this. I don't know how. 

When I have a craving - I beg myself to stop from lighting up another cigarette. I usually start smoking after I am out of home. I don't feel like smoking when I am at home. 

Today, in so far, I had only smoked one cigarette. It's almost 8 in the evening. This is happening for the first time. I am happy about it. I don't want to smoke anymore. Help me stay motivated. 

I am 25-M, I started smoking 30 months ago. I stopped after 6 months for 6 months and then I started again. When I stopped I got hypochondriac which I did not liked at all. Days, I remember were depressing. 

I don't want to go on the same road this year. I want to escape this. Need help.

I said: so that's just it?? Yeah right. Now i'm 23 and can't get enough of it. I hate the smell and everything but that process.. i feel like it's keeping me alive. A couple months ago i started to think that it's not normal to feel depressed or paranoid when you don't have any heets before going to sleep (smoking iqos for about half year now), or that day when i would just stop smoking will just never come! And the money i spend on that shit, wow, really? So that time came and i asked my dad for that book ""easy way"" He stopped smoking with that book for about 10 years now. I ask him those questions, 'dont you feel like you lost something? You really dont feel cravings anymore?? How about morning cigarette with coffee??"" So i read that book, felt so motivated, i really changed my vision of smoking and finally i understood that i feel more depressed with cigaretes. Finally i said for myself that i want to be free!! So i didn't smoke for week but started to smoke more joints. And here i am having a mental breakdowns daily cause i'm craving smoking. This addiction looks stronger than me. I can't think, do things, be with friends cause all i am thinking is that i neeeeed to smoke. Now i hate myself for that. Depression is growing with every cigarette. Feeling empty, nothing is interesting. Just sucks. Sucks to be like that.

 But still i really want to quit. And i will. I see that in my head, that i'm having fun without that.  I have to try, because when it's the best time to quit? It will never come..thinking that i should read that book again.. and start from zero again.

I feel better about not smoking but my biggest challenge is the cravings. While the lozenges help, I don‚Äôt want to be using them for too much longer so I don‚Äôt have nicotine in my system.

Everywhere you look everyone will always say how quit smoking is good for you. No one tells you how your own body will sabotage you in every possible way.

I've been trying multiple times, but about 5 weeks ago I finally succeded (almost). I'm a fairly active person, I go to the gym 3/4 times a week and of course what better way to improve my cardio.One day before going to the gym I realized I was out of rolling papers (I smoke rolled tobacco). I simply decided to not buy them anymore. Worked perfectly. During that period I was very busy studying for university exams, so my life was pretty much study/gym, being focused on other things really helped me to not think about smoking. For those who might say ""not a good idea to try to quit during stressful times like during exams"", you're half right, but for some things I believe either you do it or don't, otherwise you just end up waiting for the perfect moment for ever.The first days were not that bad. I actually felt really good immediately. The problems started around the 5th day. I started having flu like syptoms:  clogged up nose and a slightly elevated temperature, not enough to be a fever, but just enough to be super annoying making me feel super tired and weak.But I kept going, and after a couple days they went away. Then my intestine decided to go on a vacation and I got super constipated. Apparently nicotine helps you with that. After a couple days of struggle I simply couldn't go to the bathroom anymore. Sometimes I had nausea while eating, headaches in the morning, and other annoying related problems. Talked to my doctor, took some laxatives, they helped a little but in the end after 20 days without smoking I had to give up. And guess what, in a few days I completely recovered. 

If you're thinking about my diet, I actually enjoy eating healthy. Oatmeal for breakfast, one portion of veggies with every meal, yogurt and fruit as a snack during the day. Basically  a lot of fibers.

I really want to try again, but since I know what is going to happen, I'm a little scared because I don't want to have another horrible month like that.

Has anyone encountered the same problems?  Do you have any advices? Or just yell at me for being weak, that's fine too.

No need to list the benefits when you quit, I think we all know them by memory now.

Thank you in advance :)

I came home from vacay and fully immersed myself in lung cancer knowledge. I went in prepared. I knew her prognosis wasn't good. Last night she called with a weird calmness in her voice ""they found a tumor here. Oh and here. Yep, that swollen spot is a tumor too.""

My world went black. All I could do was go 'mhmm, mhmm..', I didn't want her to hear me cry. It was the hardest 39 minute phone call of my life. I expected this, but shit that was harder than I was ready for.

I haven't touched a cig. No desire at all, after 19 days I'm so over it. Mom is 20 days strong, but it's too late for her. 

Please. PLEASE QUIT. If you've managed to read to here, and you're considering quitting, god dammit do it. This pain is unbearable. She got so sick so fast. Smoking might not hurt you today... my mom started smoking at age NINE.
Here we are 50 years later and she's dying on me and her 2 grandbabies. She won't see my kids grow up. I still need her. 

Please quit. Fuck cancer. If you love ANYONE, anyone at all, plan to love someone, want a family... just stop. Cause in 50 years you might have to say goodbye, and it really fucking sucks. I wallow in this pain everyday, and we're just getting started with her prognosis.

I've been smoking since I was 12. I'm now 28.

Ever since I was 16, each new year's resolution would be about quitting. Each time, I'd fail in around two days.

I now haven't smoked in 8 months. I know I won't smoke again. But the reason I think it's working better is because I'm telling tell myself **NEVER SAY NEVER. I MIGHT SMOKE AGAIN.**

This is the opposite of the **'I am not a smoker/not even one more puff'** mantra people talk about here a lot, but I think it works for me.

Here's why.

Before, when I quit, I'd always be trying to actively NOT think about smoking, or to convince myself I didn't really enjoy it, or to think of my health, or to repeat Alan Carr's many mantras back to myself. I'd buy lots of gum and lollipops and candies to suck on, dust off my Rubik's cube so I had something to do with my hands, keep little notebooks where I'd track cravings. And on and on, filling my life up with all these little coping mechanisms. And, they worked ... for a while. But then I'd get anxious thinking about how I will **never** smoke again. Like, this is my life. I will never enjoy coffee again. Never have a post-dinner smoke. NEVER. The finality of that was tough, and I'd invariably cave.

**This time, I just can't be bothered with keeping up with the ANXIETY of not smoking.** 

Like, smoking alone is hard, sure. But the anxiety of knowing I AM NEVER GONNA SMOKE AGAIN has always been historically worse for me.

So, I just tell myself ... ""Meh, maybe I'll have another at some point"".

But, here's the secret. I know I won't.",22

I've kept trying to quit, switching to vaping and going cold turkey (this worked the first time before uni) and I usually manage a week or two or sometimes a month, but I always end up going back for one more.

My partner doesn't officially know about it when it happens. Sometimes I tell him out if guilt and sometimes I know he knows but he doesn't say anything. I hate that I keep doing it to myself and also to him. My family have always been in the dark about my smoking.

I have told myself it's stress that makes me do it... but now I actually think it's the experience of having a secret - something that is entirely my own choice and my own thing. I know that sounds really stupid but I truly think that's it. I don't like trying to be 'perfect' - I don't think it's sustainable. Also, I share absolutely everything with my partner; there are no other secrets for me to keep to myself. I think I need that bit of privacy and ownership to make me feel less dependent and more of an independent human. 

I would like to change what my secret is so I can stop smoking for good. It cant be a good secret like 'I'm secretly going to the gym' because I'm going to want to tell my partner and then he'll be on my ass when I don't go and I won't have that secret and it'll be depressing lol. I think it needs to be a little bit 'naughty' so I have no problems keeping it to myself naturally, but nothing that's going to harm my health or finances like smoking does.

Can you guys help me come up with some ideas please? I'm so ready to be smoke free.

I know it's really stupid and I should just be motivated enough to quit and not have any secrets but it's not working so far because I need a 'I'm still my own person' outlet.

P.S. I'm UK based so no gun ranges or anything like that lol.

Edit: tried to fix the formatting but I don't know if it worked - on mobile, sorry!",10

I see many posts that say it gets better after awhile and then I see many other posts saying that the craving still lingers even after a month of not smoking and this discourages me a lot.

 I understand that it's not an easy feat to accomplish but does it really get easier or (I'm sorry if this sounds inconsiderate) are the many of you just bullshitting us just so we would not give in?

Latest 3 months I was trying to quit this bad habit, because I realized that cigarettes is really useless, harmful waste of time, money and most importantly - health. 

Every day I woke up Ive asked myself: do you really want to smoke now, in the morning? I smoked every morning in the toilet, after breakfast, while going to my bus station, while going to work etc. (you know that)

And one wonderful morning I felt like I have no urge to smoke. And decided to see, how long that‚Äôs going to last. I made through one day. And after that i decided to quit. I deeply learned that smoking was doing to me, that I‚Äôm for f sake don‚Äôt need it. I needed to realize that smoking is not cool anymore.

Eventually in one month i had only two cravings, and they appeared in first seven days. Now I don‚Äôt even think about smoking. (Apart from moments when you feel bad, but anyway you let yourself to know that it won‚Äôt help and urge to smoke goes away in three seconds.) I have cigarettes in my house i can grab them anytime and smoke but i don‚Äôt, i can hangout with smoking friends one feet next me even if im drunk, i realize in my head, that i dont need it, anyway. 

I don‚Äôt know how i programmed my brain, but previous times i did fail every time in two, maximum four days.

I hope this will motivate you, guys, thanks",12

I recently took to nicotine gum and have seen a ton of luck with it as I've always been a heavy gum chewer and the nicotine has really helped keep cravings to a minimum.

I was wondering though, if anybody knew of any brands of gum that are similar enough to nicorette in texture and flavor to transition to 0mg eventually.

So far, Extra and Icebreakers haven't been much luck but I can make them work if necessary.

Any ideas?",2

I never smoked cigarettes besides a 2 week backpacking trip in 2016.  After the 2 weeks i  returned home and quit no problem.  This past summer (2019) i started smoking a juul with one of my coworker and then fell in love with the head rush from the alternative vaping product called STIK which is 6.7% nicotine.  I kept telling myself I could quit and I would just buy 1 more.  Then I told my self after I get through this day which is going to be stressful ill quit.  Well here I am almost 7 months later.  Ive gone dry a few times which lasts 2-3 days before i get extreme aggravation and fatigue.  I get cloudy headed and think about how buying a new vape would make this go away.  I get tunnel vision on anything I do but I also isolate myself.  Im even having trouble typing this.  As for physical withdrawals I feel a almost tightness in my stomach and chest like a physical craving for the vape.  How do i quit this horrible substance and how long do these withdrawals last?,3

I've already stopped smoking weed, watching porn and started to keep a bullet journal and having a more consistent sleep schedule; but with smoking, I'm just powerless. I tried 3 times this year to stop by throwing away all my cigs, but I always end giving up after 2-3 days.

I hope this time will be different. I'm writing this post to give myself more motivation and hoping to inspire others, so we can fight this monster together.

2020-03-02 06:11:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/fcakec/quit_day_slowly_creeping_in/,Quit day slowly creeping in,"Hey everyone!

I submitted a post here about 1-2 weeks ago already how I don't think I was strong enough to quit. Of course I tried, managed about 24hrs, and then I gave in again .. have been smoking ever since that day and did not try to quit again. However, I lowered my daily cigarettes to 15-20, and I try not to go over 20 cigarettes a day, so far I'm doing well (was smoking 25-30 before). Anyway, this weekend I was just discussing it with my girlfriend and she tried motivating me and supporting me to already quit it this weekend, but it was too soon and I was not ready for it. So, on a Saturday afternoon, I've decided to kick it again on Tuesday 3rd of March, which is tomorrow... I'm starting to get anxious again, but I reaaaalllyyy want to quit. I know it's hard, I already have some thoughts creeping in. But I have more reasons now than ever before. I've come to the point where I absolutely HATE smelling cigarettes all around me, on my clothes, it bothers me when I kiss my girlfriend with that mouth, it bothers me that I spend so much money on it, it bothers me that I have difficulties breathing on daily basis, and it bothers me that I feel soooo drained of energy. I want to quit. Not sure if tomorrow will be the day, but I'll try again tomorrow, taking it one day at a time. 

From what I've heard, and from what I've experienced already in the past, the first 3 days are the absolute worst!! Any tips on how to get through it ? The problem is, I work in the office environment where we have our own kitchen, and we can smoke there. The problem nr. 2 is that I really don't have enough work these days, and it's hard for me to stay busy and productive in the office for 8 hours straight. So that's when boredom kicks in, and that's when I usually smoke - a lot. I don't smoke in my car, I don't smoke in my apartment,.. I usually smoke the most at my work place, and when I'm out having drinks (which I don't do often anyway, so that shouldn't be a problem). So my biggest dilemma is how to kick through the boredom that I feel in the office and to give in. It's going to be really hard. Just writing this post right now, I already feel the cigarette craving slowly creeping in ... Any tips what to do ??? I could just leave office and go for a drive around town ? Or go for a walk ? Does drinking water help ? Chewing on something ?? What do you people do to now give in, when you're bored, and all you can think about is lightning one up ??

Many thanks!!",3

Day 6.,"I was 14 years old when I smoked my first cigarette. It was the summer before high school. I felt an over powering need to rebel and began stealing my mother's cigarettes. She was a chain smoker and would stub all her cigarettes out half way leaving an unlimited supply of ""halfies"" that fed my adolescent addiction to nicotine. At the age of 16, I began dating a 19 year old who took over as my designated cigarette supplier until I was old enough to buy my own. 

At age 18 I got a job as a nursing assistant. I began to feel ashamed and stigmatized for smoking but couldn't gather the courage to even try to quit until I was 23. I quit cold Turkey for nearly 4 months before I convinced myself that I could ""enjoy"" an occasional cigarette at the casino or bar.... obviously that one cigarette reignited a full fledged nicotine addiction that has now continued for 7 years. I turned 30 two months ago and realized I have been smoking cigarettes over half my life. 

Four years ago I got my Registered Nurse license. Yes, I am an RN. I care for patients regularly that have COPD, heart disease, vascular disease, etc from smoking!!! I have attempted about 3 or 4 other quits, usually lasting 2-5 days before smoking again. I carry so much shame and have for years. I've hid this secret from everyone in my professional life including several really good work friends. 

I smoked my last cigarette February 24th at 11:15pm. Cold Turkey. 

I read Allan Carr's book, twice. Downloaded the Smoke Free app. Browsed whyquit.com. Long time lurker of this sub. But it's been rough. Major brain fog. I can't even really say I've had individual cravings because I've just been obsessing about cigarettes 24/7. It HAS gotten better, slightly. I am slowly realizing how brainwashed I really am. I feel like this addiction is like a parasite in my brain that continuously tries to trick me. I will find myself justifying smoking again over the craziest things. Luckily I am getting better at telling myself ""That's ridiculous"" and reminding myself that it wont always be this bad. I also know there is not one positive aspect of smoking. 

I think worst part is the depression that has accompanied this quit. I'm highly irritable. I'm also just feeling like there is nothing in life to look forward to (I know this is irrational but the feeling is still real to me). I can't help but feel sorry for myself and basically mope around. I love cooking, spending time with my family, going outdoors, etc. but all I want to do is watch TV or sleep to numb my mind. Any tips to snap out of it and quit feeling sorry for myself? I just want to fast forward a year and have smoking behind me.

I had a scare the other day when I woke up and couldnt catch my breath. I am already under doctors care for my asthma, allergies, other health issues that are related to smoking. I went to the hospital just incase and ofcourse was told it is just a severe case of bronchitis,  surprise surprise! üòí

Anyway, I haven't smoked since the night before the hospital trip and would like to keep it going seeing as I am still very sick and can barely breathe so have physically not been able to smoke for 2 days. This is the easiest time to quit. 

Unfortunately I also just started a diet a few weeks ago which is actually doable and going really well. We all know eating can be a great go to for smoke craving replacements! 

What are some other proven, effective replacement activities, habits, small gestures?! Things that can be done at work or in bed, not necessarily exercising or anything big. I have not stopped craving a cigarette for the past 24 hours and I'm afraid once my lungs recoup from bronchitis it will be all too easy to just have one because ""I deserve it after all this"" üòë

Smoker of menthols for 12 years 10 of those were 1 pack a day. And 5 of those 10 were two packs a day. I swore i would never quit. But here I am about to turn 27 and its worse everyday. I didn't want to quit. I enjoy smoking. But I know i needed to for my health. I quit cold turkey after trying almost everything.  The cravings are worse now then they were in the begining. My skin is constantly on fire. Like my insides hurt for it. I know it may be some mental thing. But i feel like im losing my mind because im not smoking. I think about it all day everyday. I havent found any relief. What did yall do? Is there any help? I want to start again. But ive worked so hard to quit. Help please,14

The cravings are subsiding but I‚Äôm having trouble mentally identifying as a non-smoker. Part of me is saying, this is ridiculous, just go back to what you do. The other part knows I need to stay quit. So, for those of you that quit, is this just my irrational brain/still withdrawal and will that go away?",8

Drinking, smoking on and off for over 20 years, cursing...anyways, after having completed a year tour at Ft. Hood, I‚Äôve made the conscious decision to stop smoking. Been back for 4 weeks and smoke free. 
My question is...I seriously feel crappier now than when I was smoking! 
I‚Äôm active, I run and do HIIT (high intensity interval training) I do notice that I‚Äôm coughing up all the phlegm that‚Äôs been hiding in my chest. But I‚Äôm experiencing loss of energy (I believe) when working out. I feel like I have less strength too. 
How long after have you guys seen improvements since quitting smoking? 
I figure it takes time and all. I just feel frustrated a bit. 
I‚Äôm excited though to have finally quit. Thanks guys and I‚Äôm behind you all in your efforts as well!",3

i have been smoking for about 40 years of my life. Started in my prime of 16.

So i went to other week to Kaiser and attend their ""non smoking class"" and to receive the patches.  
I did not like to get the medication since you can not really drink alcohol. Oh, one poison i wanted to keep.

Anyway, i did had a strange burning sensation before i stopped smoking. Felt like an ashtray sometimes in my throat.

The first week went ok with the patch. Second week i went without patch and was surprised how easily i could manage. I did however had visions of cigarettes everywhere. Little strange.

This is my 3th week now. I still have my throat feeling like an ashtray and my bronchitis feeling stuffed. Though my doctors said it is normal. Really? Well, i waiting for the xray to coming back. Hopefully nothing bad there.

I did actually enjoy smoking. The sad truth is, that even with stopping smoking, you can not stop cancer. This should not discourage anyone, but as i know now through family tragedy, it is no guarantee.

I hope i can stay sober.",3
