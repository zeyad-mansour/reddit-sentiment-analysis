I’m not a 30 year smoker, it isn’t ruining my life, but it has managed to get its hooks into me and I want to stop so, here it is.

I started off smoking pure cbd flower jointsfrom a farm in Oregon after a severe injury and surgeries. I didn’t want opiates and the cbd took just enough edge off the pain to make it livable.

It smells like pot, and while legal, it caused some friction with neighbors and so on.

My mistake, I realize now, was buying a pack of djarum cloves and mixing 20/80 to hide the smell. All was well, but I noticed I got a little edgy if I went too long without. Then I ran out of cbd flower and tried smoking one of the cigarettes plain. I didn’t really like it, it was gross, but before I knew it I was finding excuses to dip out to the garage and smoke a cigarette under my welding tables extractor fan.

Fast forward a few months, and I’m up to a pack a week (I know that’s probably not much compared to many, but it’s a lot for me). Sometimes a few days without, sometimes half a pack in an evening if highly stressed. I get edgy when I run out, I find myself eager to get home before my wife so I can burn one in the garage and take a quick shower before she gets home. 

I spent a bunch of self reflection time and realized

I already talked about hotels in my last post, but that would be one. So here are some other things I've thought of

1. Your lighter breaking while on your break and having to wander up the road trying to find someone smoking an actual cigarette, hoping people at work won't notice you've been gone for three hours while your break is becoming more stressful and you know you'll be staying at work late. 


2. Trying to hold a bag and an umbrella, whilst on the phone in the rain, whilst also trying to roll, light and smoke a cigarette in the wind, with rizlas blowing everywhere and your brolly turning inside out. Because you just can't wait till you get home.


3. Picking a half smoked cigarette out of the kitchen bin, drying on the radiator, re rolling and realising it really does taste of bin and thinking hard about your life choices . (this was my last cigarette. I'd decided I was going to quit but there is always just one more to be had, I'd used all the tobacco scrapings and so that was it. I am revolting. )


4. For the roll up people, bits of tobacco everywhere. In your pockets, in your bag, and if they get damp/rained on a bit everything that gets pulled out of the bag has bits of soggy tobacco stuck to it and a nice yellow stain.


5. If you are messy like me- emtpy packets, wrappers, rizlas, filters everywhere. Your handbag resembles a bin. 


6. Never mind the normal stink, that awful odour of the dead butt you shoved in your bag/pocket because there was no bin (I never litter) and people in the neighbouring county can smell it and you. 


7. When you buy them from the same shop and you start thinking you are going to have to move house because the shop assistant now knows quite how much you smoke and is going to judge you.


8. Picking 'no smokers' option when buying house insurance because you are feeling optimistic then forever hoping your house doesn't burn down.


9. You've not been on it with the kitchen door manoeuvre in the morning/right before bed and the cat legs it outside so you have to wait up to half an hour for her to come back in, making you late/tired. 


10. Sitting/stepping on a slug when you go out for your bedtime smoke in the dark and learning that slug slime does not wash off skin easily. Or not realising a small slug has crawled onto your dressing gown which you then later find in your bed/stuck to your thigh.

My favorite is the classic tobacco, it can give me a real feeling of smoking. mango and blueberries are also good, I love to try different flavors.

I have used it for about 20 days so far and now I no longer have a bad cough, and after the free samples used up, I think I may continue to use them so that I will not at least keep coughing.

Allen Carr's Easyway To Stop Smoking - TOP TIPS -
Top Tips for your readers and listeners for a smoke-free 2014
Essential background to the top ten tips.

Many people think Allen Carr's Easyway is simply a series of tips to help smokers quit. It isn't. It's as if smokers are lost in a maze. They want to escape but they don't know the correct directions. Allen Carr's method provides a map of the maze and simple instructions to help any smoker get free. However, if you try to follow the instructions without first understanding the map, or you fail to follow all the instructions, you may never find the exit. It normally takes 5-6 hours for smokers to get free at Allen Carr's clinics. If you are serious about stopping, we strongly recommend you attend your nearest Allen Carr clinic or read the book ""Allen Carr's Easyway To Stop Smoking"" or ""Stop Smoking Now"" before making your attempt. It is particularly important that you understand Allen's central point that in reality there is nothing to give up because smoking provides you with no genuine pleasure or crutch and so you are not making any sacrifice at all and there is no reason to feel deprived. That may sound difficult to believe but I promise you it's true and understanding why is an essential part of stopping easily, painlessly and permanently. Once you've got it clearly into your mind that there are no advantages to smoking, then the following instructions will help you get free:
1) Set your date and time to stop and carry on smoking as usual right up to that time - don't try to cut down beforehand, that just makes cigarettes seem more precious rather than less so.
2) Remember - you're not giving up anything because cigarettes do absolutely nothing for you at all. They provide you with no genuine pleasure or crutch, they simply keep you addicted - a slave to nicotine. Get it clearly into your mind: you are losing nothing and you are making marvellous positive gains not only in health, energy and money but also in confidence, self-respect, freedom and, most important of all, in the length and quality of your future life. You're going to enjoy being a non-smoker right from the moment you put out your last cigarette.
3) Light your final cigarette and make a solemn vow that regardless of what highs or lows may befall you in future, you will never puff on another cigarette or take nicotine in any form again. This is one of the most important decisions you will ever make because the length and quality of your future life critically depend on it. What's more, you know it's the correct decision even as you make it. Having made what you know to be the correct decision never even begin to question or to doubt that decision.
3) Your body will continue to withdraw from nicotine for a few days but that doesn't mean you have to be miserable. The physical withdrawal is very slight - there is no pain - and it passes quickly. What's more, it's what smokers suffer all their smoking lives. Non-smokers do not suffer it. You are a non-smoker and so you'll soon be free of it forever.
4) If you associate a cigarette with a coffee, tea, drink or break, have your coffee, tea, drink or break and at that moment, instead of thinking: ""I can't have a cigarette now"", simply think: ""Isn't it great: I can enjoy this moment without having to choke myself to death"".
5) Do not try to avoid smoking situations or opt out of life. Go out and enjoy social occasions right from the start and do not envy smokers, pity them. Realise that they will be envying you because every single one of them will be wishing they could be like you: free from the whole filthy nightmare. No smoker wants to see their children start smoking which means they wish they hadn't started themselves. Remember it's not you who are being deprived but those poor smokers. They're being deprived of their health, energy, money, peace of mind, confidence, courage, self-respect and freedom. If you're offered a cigarette, just say: ""No thanks - I don't smoke"", rather than start a long conversation about how long it has been since you stopped.
5) Don't try not to think about smoking - it doesn't work. If I say: ""Don't think about a brick wall, what are you thinking about? Just make sure that whenever you are thinking about it, you're not thinking: ""I want a cigarette but I can't have one"" but instead: ""Isn't is marvellous: I don't need to smoke anymore and I don't want to smoke anymore. Yippee, I'm a non-smoker!"" Then you can think about it all you like and you'll still be happy.
6) Never be fooled into thinking you can have the odd cigarette just to be sociable or just to get over a difficult moment. If you do, you'll find yourself back in the trap in no time at all. Never think in terms of one cigarette, always think of the whole filthy lifetime's chain. Remember: there is no such thing as just one cigarette.
7) Do not use any substitutes. They all make it more difficult to stop because they perpetuate the illusion that you're making a sacrifice. Substitutes that contain nicotine, i.e. so-called Nicotine Replacement Therapy - patches, gums, nasal sprays and inhalators - are particularly unhelpful as they simply keep the addiction to nicotine alive. It's like advising a heroin addict who's smoking the drug off foil, to start injecting it instead.
8) Do not keep cigarettes on you or anywhere else in case of an emergency. If you do, it means you're doubting your decision. Non-smokers do not need cigarettes. You are already a non-smoker the moment you put out your final cigarette. In fact one of the many joys of being free is do not need cigarettes. You are already a non-smoker the moment you put out your final cigarette. In fact one of the many joys of being free is not having to worry about having cigarettes and a light on you, of ending that slavery.
9) Life will soon go back to normal as a non-smoker but be on your guard not to fall back into the trap. If your brain ever starts playing tricks on you by thinking ""Just one cigarette"", remember there is no such thing, so the question you need to ask yourself is not: ""Shall I have a cigarette now"" but ""Do I want to become a smoker again, all day, every day sticking those things into my mouth, setting light to them, never being allowed to stop?"" The answer ""No"". Why not? ""Because I didn't like being a smoker - that's why I decided to become a non-
smoker"". That way those moments can become pleasurable as you congratulate yourself that you're free and that way you can enjoy remaining a non-smoker for the rest of your life.
10) If you have any difficulties at all please feel free to contact Allen Carr Clinics for free advice. You can do this by calling 0800 389 2115 or visiting www.allencarr.com",28,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46778342}"

I was a pack a day smoker for 8 years starting around age 20.  Switched to vaping for a while and a combo of smoking/vaping for another decade.  As of now it's day 27 without a cigarette or a vape hit.  However I'm suffering today due to something I had never heard of before: sugar alcohols.

Using nicotine patches has really helped me along but I find without a mint or a piece of gum I start getting ansy and the urge to vape or buy a pack gets stronger and stronger.  For the first few days I bought a bunch of different kinds of mints and gums.  I never really used them before this and wanted to see what was out there.  I settled onto extra peppermint for gum and ice breakers spearmint for mints.

Everything seemed to be ok so I ordered a bunch of both and thought myself well-armed to go forward with my quitting effort.  Then my god damned tire blew out and I had to change it in the rain and then miss half a day of work getting it replaced today.

I have been super busy the last few months, nearing the point of burn out and thought I was finally coming out of it when I decided to quit.  Seemed like good timing.  But the work has only gotten crazier and I had a huge project to get done today.

The stress of it all drove me to chew up a ton of gum and suck down a ton of mints, way, way more than my previous consumption.  Both the gum and mints I like the most contain sugar alcohols like sorbitol, xylitol etc.  And they are basically not-digestible.  So they cause intense gas and other even less pleasant digestive consequences.

I'm writing this from my laptop on the toilet where I have been for the last hour or so in abject misery.  Just wanted to warn any other people newly starting out to be aware of the potential causes.

However I am terrified of it. Mostly because smoking always been a way for me to cope with my struggles, a way to free my mind, calm down, stress relief etc. It was just my escape goat. And I'll be removing something that has been apart of my life for 10 years. (I'm 26 now). Anyways. I have about less than half a bag of tobacco left, and once that bag is out. I'm done. No more smoking, just going to stop. I decided that I'm going to take the cold turkey method and not replace it with something else such as patches, or vaping. I just want nicotine out of my life.   


I've heard from numerous people that the 3rd day is the hardest day? I am planning on just sleeping a lot, I have medication for anxiety and sleep already so I'll just try to continue sleeping for the first 3 or so days? I don't really know yet lol. I'm also going to keep myself busy and take my dog for walks and just stay active and busy.  


Right now due to not being at work for personal reasons, I feel like this is the best time to quit. I have much more time to myself and I won't be stressed out in a working environment. So I feel like I have an opportunity that many other smokes don't have, and I should take it.

First off I want to say popping into this sub was what really helped me begin the road to stop so thank you everyone for that.

So I smoked for about 13 years, tried stopping a couple of times in the last year but finally cracked it, over 3 months down and no desire for smoking at all.

Now the point of the title, everytime I'm bored, annoyed, happy, but mostly if I'm just wanting to sit back and relax, just chill out and watch the world go by yano? I think a cig would be a perfect addition to the moment and it always used to be.

And the other day I had someone with me for the week at work, he smoked, didnt bother me at all but we were sat there and I caved 'go on then I'll have one so he rolls one and gives it to me with the lighter, his phone rings and he wonders off leaving me alone and I'm looking at this cig thinking 'probably dont smoke this' but i have had a relaxed couple of weeks after about a year of pure stress and my brain tricked me in a that way it dose with us all by saying 'go on you deserve it' so I lit it up.

I took a drag....I didnt inhale it (like youd smoke a cigar) I took two more drags and didnt inhale them, i just, wasnt ok with it :/ it didnt have the factor it had before, you know where you haven't had one ages, take the first drag and just exhale in relief/satisfaction, I threw it away after those 3 non drags and haven't had the urge to try again. 

What I hate though is, WTF do I do to give that extra dose of relaxation, of de stressing etc, i have walked around since I stopped thinking things like 'oh this is perfect weather for a cig' this is a great place to have a smoke' 'a smoke would be amazing after this big meal I just ate' not in the sense that I even wanted one it's just, that's what I know to do to enhance a situation, and now I dont have it and dont even like it I'm actually kind of annoyed about it. 

Has anyone else had this? 


TLDR: Stopped smoking after 13 years, over 3 months down alls good, brain tricked me into having a cig by telling me Iv earned it, got one from a co worker, took 3 drags (didnt inhale them) and threw it away, I dont like smoking anymore, but that's all I know to enhance a situation to make it even better, WTF now?",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.48151857}"

My sisters and I were my mothers whole life for most of her life. Somehow she convinced her husband not to tell us girls how sick she was. I can’t imagine what she was going through but one of the strongest women I know did not have the strength to share the extent of her diagnosis with her daughters , she just couldn’t break our hearts.  She kept telling us the treatments were working . She died on a plane coming home to see me. I was devastated . Several months ago I woke up sobbing, I was dreaming about the certain agony my mother must have experienced when she found out she was dying and was going to leave her girls.  I cried for several hours that night . Yet it still took me a few months to get the courage and strength to take on another quit. But finally I have my reason..I don’t want to have to tell my daughter that I’m dying . This is my mantra and it keeps me strong . I hope this can help someone else have the strength . 20 day non smoker :)",14,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5363473}"

I am trying not to smoke but the vacation has ended, got back to work and I am experience crippling anxiety. I cant look people in the eyes as it gives me panic attack like symptoms - intense jittering, vision becomes narrow... I cant focus, I cant think straight, I act awkward.

Physical health has never been better, but mentally I am on the verge. 
I have experienced nights during which I dont sleep and feel really anxious, punishing myself inside, think how void and empty I am.  Its not real, i know, but I feel like it is.

I hate smoking and feeling like pile of shit physically each evening, I hate crashing each evening due to enormous amount of nicotine consumed throughout the day.
But I cant keep going without a cig anymore. I smoked two today. What a bliss and calming experience was that. Of course shame and self regret followed that. 

Please guys could you share your experiences, tips on how to combat mental withdrawal symptoms.

I am a 19 (almost 20) year old that started vaping at the age of 17. I have just recently quit smoking because my friends at my school wanted to do a sober month to celebrate the release of animal crossing New horizons. This sober month includes caffeine, nicotine, alcohol and marijuana and if we cave we owe everyone 5$ and have to take an ACT.

I tried vaping my junior year when I stayed over at a friend's house for a week because my parents were fighting and I nearly had a panic attack. At the time I was a huge prude and thought very negatively of any substance but as they offered me for some reason I figured ""why the hell not"" and the immediate buzz gave me a release from the pressure I kept in my head. 

I continued to subtly do it with my friend until I decided to get my own. From there it spiraled I have probably spent a 1000$ on e-cigarrette products and disposables. Every time my situation progressed I would get more and more heavily addicted. I got to the point where I needed it to function and used it during track and cross country season even though I know it killed my times. 

After some things have happened I ended up quitting running and got considerably depressed. I worked a decent job to pay for groceries as no one was providing for my family and I gained weight and lost motivation. This was due to the instant dopamine I was getting from nicotine.

I went to college with large ambitious of returning to my normal state before my family caved in. I joined D3 cross country and thought it wouldn't be too hard to adjust again. For some reason I just couldn't quit and ended up leaving the team.

Now you may ask what caused me to turn this around. I have a girl back at home that I love and she has no idea I feel this way but we're good friends and I want her to see I'm doing something with my life and I'm improving. As well as the guys I'm doing a sober month with are the cross country guys that hilariously are stoners. We all thought it would benefit all of us if we let our lungs rest. 

Now I'm running with another guy in a similar situation that I'm in trying to get back into shape for the team. While this is happening I quit nic and my lungs feel amazing and my muscles actually feel way less tense. I'm actually better then when I first got here after just five days.

The first three days were absolutely terrible but day four I could smell again, I could taste the individual piecies of salt on a pretzel. It was wonderful. Trust me. It is. Worth. It. Every second of pain and misery is worth it.

If you ever think you can't do it. Remember how fast a week can go by. That's all it takes. If anyone has any questions or wants me to remove this post because it is too personal please let me know. I'm not done but I feel amazing. You got this don't let anyone tell you differently.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.47554022}"

I'm 26, have been smoking actively since I was 20, so 6 years straight now. I did take a break from it once, when I tried to quit, managed to go full 3 weeks at that time, but I slipped and ended up smoking even more. I smoke about 25-30 cigs a day now.

After those 24 hours, the symptoms of withdrawals were so bad, I felt physically ill (headache, my lungs hurt, dizziness). I went straight to the nearest gas station, bought myself a pack, and smoke 3 cigarettes straight one after another. The sensation after smoking those 3 cigarettes was out of this world. All of a sudden everything made sense again, and I just stop feeling so lost and insecure. Anyway, maybe some people just can't quit. I really want to, but I guess I can't.

Would this be something temporarily (I did a slower build up in dosis, so only started the 2*1mg pill a couple days ago). Anyone had the same and can say it’ll get better or not?
Or is it maybe an idea to lower the dose to 1,5 or even 1 mg?

It’s the only side effect I have, but since I work out around 3-4 times a week, this limits me in my daily life. and tbh if I can’t work out next 2-3 months I’ll be really sad. Working out makes my head free and my mood so much better... :(

Just want to say I love reading all of the tips and strategies in this subreddit.

Everytime I open my reddit app I always end up reading one or 2 good quotes from allan carrs material or some nice mantra or strategy or tactic that adds to my repertoire. All from your comments and posts.

My favorite one recently: being relaxed is a mindset, it has nothing to do with smoking.

That's helped me grapple with the idea of being up at the cottage on a sunny day with a beer or coffee and enjoying myself without a smoke. HUGE for me because that's one of my favorite smoking rituals and environments. No one wants to feel fomo but missing out on a smoke should not be something you fear missing.

So in 4 months when its sunny and warm I will not relapse!

Im pretty sure I dont even eat that 2000-2500 calories a day sometimes but Im still scared that I will be a chonky guy whatever I do and then I would need to do a fuckton of cardio or diet to stay in shape.

VaPiNg Is WoRsE ThEn SmOkInG, Im mOrE AdDiCtEd To NiCoTiNe ThEn EvEr

then in the next line they mention they are using a Juul, One thing I dont like about the Juul is they say like 5% nicotine on the box, that dosnt mean anything to me, so I searched how strong that is in mg/ml and thats 59mg/ml, which is crazy high

I switched from smoking 3 years ago never planning on quiting, and I used 6mg/ml fluid for most of that time

then I decided to quit, and I got a chantix script from my doctor, hoping that would make me not want to vape, after 2 weeks of taking chantix, it had no effect on my vaping frequency, so I decided to taper my nicotine

where chantix did help was I was able to taper my nicotine in half every couple days, really comfortably, I went from 6 - 3 - 1.5 - 0.7 - 0.3 - 0.1 -0.05, and at 0.05 I started to get withdawals so I dropped it down to no nicotine

after 10 days of no nicotine I quit the chantix, and I made it 40 days before I stupidly got myself hooked on cigars for some dumb reason, I smoked cigars for about 30 days before I switched back to a vape, I tried to start at 3mg, but wasnt doing it so I bumped it up to 5mg and I switched back at 5mg

I vaped 5mg for 2 weeks till I was sure I didnt want anymore cigars and started tapering again, this time without the help of chantix, and I was only able to comfortably taper down to 0.5mg/ml this time, I tried to go lower but I started to nic, so I made a appointment to get more chantix and try again, my appointment is next week

im not sure how many pods a person goes through, but a pod is 0.7ml at 59mg/ml, so a pod is like a single pack of smokes

I could comfortably taper down to 0.5mg/ml without the help of drugs this time, with my tank I go through 15ml a day, with my RDA I go through 30ml a day (a day where I sit at home all day, if I go out and do stuff I go through less)

so lets say worse case scenario I go through 30ml at 0.5mg/ml is 15mg nicotine or about 7.5 cigarettes, so compared to when I was smoking I would go through about 20 cigs a day

so all in all, I go through less nicotine then when I smoked, vaping dosnt have to be worse, Juuls are just a bad route to go because of how stupid strong they are",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5540615}"

I am incredibly addicted (both emotionally and physically) to smoking. I smoke not only in social situations, but even more when I am alone, chainsmoking while working, watching TV, browsing the web etc. I have quit twice in my life and I am slowly mentally preparing myself to quit for the third time, but I want this to be the final one, so I want to take every possible precaution.

The problem with the previous times (one was quitting for 10 days, the second was for 3 months) was something I wasn't prepared for. I had cravings, mood swings, increased appetite, all of that, but that wasn't the problem at all. The problem was that life completely lost all its colors. Life became boring, sad, joyless, like my dopamine circuits had been hacked or smt. I believe this phenomenon is called ""Ahedonism"", I guess. I made a conscious decision to restart smoking after the first time. When I quit for the second time, I thought, if this happens, I just need to give it some time in order for my brain to rewire. However, the joylessness just increased over time. Life became so unbearable I consciously decided to restart smoking again, and the joy returned immediately. Now I am rather scared to try and fail for the third time.

Smoking for 20 years 
10+ years @ 2 packs a day 
Son due in 20 days

I’m not a casual smoker. I admit I’m 100% addicted to smoking BUT I do love everything about the ACT of smoking. I love the ritual of smoking. I love the quiet time of smoking. I love the introspectiveness of smoking. I love the rebellious nature of being a smoker. 

I could go on and on. 

Frankly I actually never thought quitting would be something I’d do. I knew I was trapped. But I wasn’t unhappy about it. My life accepts smoking very well (by design). I’m able to smoke at will all day every day. I have rituals surrounding the act of smoking. 

My wife quit smoking 3 years ago and 8 months ago she got pregnant (yes it’s mine lol). 

Over the last 8 months (in the evenings and weekends) every habit, ritual and consistency has been thrown out the window as I don’t smoke in front of her (she’s pregnant and I’m not “that guy”) 

With 20 days left before little man arrives I had a really stupid (and obvious) epiphany....... see for the last 8 months my dumb man brain kept telling myself that once the baby is here Things (smoking habits and rituals) will go back to normal. Well, clearly that was incredibly stupid........ once she’s “not pregnant” there will be a baby tagging along everywhere. 

As much as I love smoking (and have accepted this addiction) I don’t want it for my son and certainly don’t want my decision to negativity persuade his decision. 

So I’m loaded up on nicotine replacement aids. Rocking a patch and found these nicotine toothpicks. 

I can’t say they’re working 100% as I still want to either smoke 40 cigarettes in one sitting or murder the next person who breathes near me. But I have never gone 24 hours without a cigarette. 

My arms and legs feel tense. 
I’m 100% restless and unable to sit still and focus. 
My body is clearly unhappy about this decision. 
The dreams were pretty wild but woke up feeling well rested (one downside to smoking was the 8 hours of withdrawal while sleeping)
Coffee isn’t the same without its compadre 
I’m constantly panicking due to realizing I don’t have cigarettes in my pocket


Oddly the only reprieve has been to crack of office window and inhale the cold crisp winter breeze. 

I tossed all the ashtrays but haven’t gotten up the strength to toss the remainder of my last pack. I’m also kinda enjoying these tease of seeing them sit there. Maybe I’m a masochist. 

I do know this. I don’t want to be out front of the hospital enjoying back to back smokes and miss the birth of my son. I also don’t want to be smoke free and trapped in a hospital being grumpy and unable to support my wife. 

So this is me. 24 hours without a cigarette.

I started vaping with a JUUL about two years ago, then after a year switched to a vape called ""MYLÉ"", and now (about a year later) I'm using diposable vapes called ""puff bars"".

I have very sensitive skin and to make a long story short, you've probably never heard of this happening to anyone as a result of vaping before but, it's causing my eyes to become incredibly dry and black, looking like I got in a fight and lost...badly, and it's **very** noticeable, even from a distance. I also suffer from angular cheilitis (think of it like chapped lips x1000, except it's on the **sides** of your lips, causing excruciating pain when you open your mouth, especially when having to take large bites to eat) and it's certainly not helping that either.

Vaping has been causing these symptoms after only a few months of starting and I've suffered from them since. When I look in the mirror, I'm ashamed. I can't stand the way I look. I don't know if vaping adds years to your face the way tobacco/cigarettes does, but this is just as bad/revolting.

But the thing is, this is **exactly** what I am going to use as my driving factor to quit. Quitting nicotine requires willpower, and willpower *usually* requires a driving factor (assuming you're not born with it). Every time I get cravings for nicotine, all I'm going to do is look in the mirror. And my face is going to be a reminder to quit vaping and that if I want it to heal/to look normal again, I can take all of the supplements and use all of the ointments I want, but quitting is the only thing left that will fix my face.

**TL:DR;** If you're having trouble quitting nicotine or smoking, have a driving factor that pushes you over the edge and makes you say ""this needs to stop before things get worse"". You can't just tell yourself that ""nothing bad is going to happen if I continue, not for awhile at least"" or ""hospitilization due to smoking/vaping only happens to **other people,** that'll never happen to me"", no. **Everyone** is subject to the consequences of smoking/vaping including me, you and anybody else you know that smokes or not.

I smoke usually in these situations:

1) I'm socially with someone that smokes.

2) I'm nervous or feeling a bit anxious around someone else.

3) I need an excuse to stay outside for 5 minutes.

4) I join someone smoking to get to know that person.

5) I smoke because I think it will relax me (it doesn't).

So that being said, I'm thinking of other things I can do that would keep me busy. For me smoking is like some passive, mindless activity to disconnect me from whatever I'm doing. But so could be eating candy to be honest. For example, I've found that drinking tonic water is a good replacement for smoking. It gives me a sense of satisfaction and keeps me busy. I'm strange like that.

Candy I don't know if it is a good idea because I'll end up eating three boxes in one hour. I've tried natural snacks but they weren't that good. Nuts could work.

Anyway, you get the point. I don't suffer from nicotine withdrawal as much as I suffer from a need to do something with my hands in those moments. It's the same when I'm in a bar or pub. I'll take sips often from the glass because I'm nervous. The glass can last me for one hour but I'll take sips every two minutes or so.

worst of all, i enjoy it. the cigarette in the morning, after dinner, while enjoying a cold beverage or after a workout.

i look around me and i wonder, i work out everyday. i eat and drink clean for a long time, i take supplements and always tought id be stronger. i see fat people that dont workout, smoking in their 50's at work. The guy looks amazing, no complains no nothing.

2020-02-20 04:48:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/f6qtdy/the_smoking_antidote/,The smoking antidote,"It's running. Going for a run where it will get you out of breath in the first few minutes and sustaining this feeling during your run for as long as you possibly can.

There are multiple reasons why this helps. So when a craving hits you you need to get your running shoes on and get outside or on the treadmill and just start running. Less than 5 minutes later as your lungs start to burn smoking a cigarette and clogging them up with smoke will be the absolute last thing on your mind. This will continue for the duration of your run.

Keep this out of breath pace up for as long as you can (let's say 20-30mins) and you really don't have much to think about when you're running. Your mind starts to wander, and one of the thing you'll fixate on is your breathing, you will start to think about every single cigarette you have ever smoked in your life and start regretting each and every one of them.

Finally, once you finish your run you will have an intense dopamine rush, your mood is elevated, and you'll feel very good about yourself. The best thing is this feeling is addictive, vert addictive. And if you are here reading this chances are you have an addictive personality. Soon you'll find yourself running several times per week. Challenging yourself to run faster, longer and this addiction is healthy for the mind body and spirit.

One extra benefit is you'll burn around 300-400 calories during 30 mins exercise. And that's 300-400 extra calories you can snack on during the day when you're not running!

Anyway. I'm off for a run, peace out ✌️",11,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.51535344}"

I'm almost 20 now, I grew up as a passive smoker, my mom was smoking during pregnancy and still does, my dad has been an active smoker for over 25 years, my older brother was smoking since I was 11, and I had my first cigarettes when I was just 12. 

I've since been smoking on and off, always quitting for a few days/weeks then relapsing when drinking or just hanging out with smoker friends. The longest I went without cigarettes (although still smoking weed from time to time which kinda defeated the whole thing) was a year and 4 months, ending when I had a major breakdown because of depression and suicidal thoughts.

Cigarettes have always been a way of accompaniment during social gatherings with alcoholic drinks involved, a fidget when hanging out/walking places, or just a habit when wasting time on the internet. I have this behavioural pattern of saying that I'm not actually addicted, I just WANT to smoke. (try again, fool)

Now, after starting NoFap 10 days ago, wanting to keep the whole thing with self-control, self-improvement, better health and quality of life in general going, I decided to fight my urges to put that burning cancer stick in my mouth. Currently I'm on my 3rd day of not smoking, despite the fact I've visited my mother and stepfather (both heavy smokers af) twice already.

Also, I'll casually mention I have a small and benign liver condition, and I'm advised to not put too much stress on it, which is exactly what happens when a load of toxins hit your body all at once.

I firmly believe that through strength of willpower and reading all your inspirational life-changing stories, I too can kick that stupid and DEADLY habit.

Fast forward 6 years, we get divorced, she quits, I kept it up, I'm 45 now. I tried quitting a few times but I wasn't really motivated as much I could have been.  On the 3rd of Feb a buddy of mine who's been crashing on my couch for a few weeks and is a chain smoker got pneumonia and was in hospital for a few days. When he got out I suggested we both buckle down and quit cold turkey.  He agreed, and that was enough motivation for me. Hospital gave him 8 weeks worth of patches and gum to help quit. He gave me a few packs of gum but I decided to not use them. It's been 13 days without a single puff and no nicotine gum. Once my brain really turned on to ""stop smoking"" it hasn't been a debilitating challenge for me. Sure I get massive urges, especially after cleaning, eating, stuff like that where you'd reward yourself with a smoke after doing a task, but when I get those urges, I just say 'fuck it' and move along with my day.   I think this is it, I think this the time where I'm done with smoking for good. My buddy is needing the gum, he's smoked for 30 years, but he's been good. We threw out all our cigs, and have thrown away all our ash trays except for one. I've been around family who smokes and it's not been a big deal.

2020-02-19 12:47:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/f6ec5z/a_few_tips_from_a_former_smoker/,A few tips from a former smoker,"I wanted to write this for a while but something always got in the middle.

I used to smoke for 10 years, ages 13ish to 23, today I'm 25.5, 2 and a half years clean (I actually quit smoking the same day my mom stopped, she's the reason I stopped actually, and we're both cigs free to this day and she smoked for over half a decade).

 It did take me a few attempts to quit, but each time I tried and failed, I learned from why I returned to smoking and made sure it doesn't happen again and I'll touch some of these points:

1. First, we need to realize that cigarettes hijack our biological ""reward"" system, that system purpose is to remember the actions, environments, people, and everything that happened around you that lead to achieving something with importance (food, water, sex, etc) but in our case - Nicotine, which also activates that pathway, so when we smoke a cigarette, our brain pairs our environment and actions to a cigarette, that's why the hardest part of quitting, is not smoking when doing actions that are paired with a cigarette, such as drinking coffee, after a meal, during work break, we all have these cigs habits and crave cigarettes at these moments the most. the good news? that pairing could be undone, by simply not smoking while doing these actions, for example - my brain paired coffee with a cigarette,  so the first the I drank a coffee without a cig it was really hard, second coffee was also hard, third was a little easier, fourth, fifth, seventh - until my brain finally disassociated coffee from a cigarette, now the ""hard"" part is doing this with all of your smoking with habits, disassociate every single habit with cigs, it can even be environments, people, and many other stuff as well.
2. Your biggest enemy - ""Only one won't harm"". On my third attempt at quitting, I was already 3 months cigs free, I disassociated most of my smoking habits already and was pretty much in the clear, until one day I got really angry over something so I asked my friend for a cig, he tried to convince me not to because he knew I stopped but I insisted till he agreed, and I smoked that cig, and I noticed that ALL of my old ""smoking with"" habits returned, the brain restored all of its connections with smoking (what I spoke of on the first part), later that day I drank a coffee and just had to smoke a cig, same goes for after eating, and I found myself smoking regulary again, so what I learned this day was - There is no such thing as ""only one cig"", your brain will revert back to day 1 of quitting and literally destroy and wipe all of the progress you made, this is the most major thing rule - not. even. one. just think of the craving you went through, you don't want to restart all of that.
3. I've read somewhere that craving could last only up to 7 minutes at a time, and I found that to be true, all you have to do is waste 7 minutes literally doing anything, go pour yourself a glass of water, do a walk, listen to music, doesn't matter what, just do something, the tricky part here and with quitting in general is when you're a fresh quitter, is that craving intervals are very very short so it feels like one big crave, when one craving is over the next one is quick to come, but as time goes, these intervals grows bigger and bigger until craving no longer exists.
4. Do not have cigs available to you - when you first start, some craving can be really intense, and sometimes too strong and when cigs are around you just can't handle the temptation, when you don't have cigs around, you can crave like there's no tomorrow, there's simply nothing you can smoke, and even if you go outside and try to get some, the craving most likely would subside till you manage to get somewhere.

Those are it, I hope some of you could make use of some of these tips, and I apologize for any grammatical mistake as I'm not a native speaker.

Once the addiction was satisfied, I'd just go back inside and continue where I left off.

I posted a few days ago about being on vacation, and receiving the bad news about my mom being diagnosed with lung cancer whilst I was here. We fly home tomorrow.

I am 5 days strong! Tomorrow is 6! And the best news is, my mom is STILL smoke free too! I'm so damn proud of her. While she was in the hospital, her fiance had some diabetes issues, and was admitted 4 floors below her in the same hospital. He is still in there, and I assumed (wrong) that she would fall into her ""just one puff"" BS... Luckily my tough love really got to her.

So. Since my children and I weren't there for Valentine's Day, or her diagnosis, I think we will surprise her with a big bouquet of flowers Thursday. I want her to know I got her back. We can do this.

We are stronger than paper loaded with gun powder and shit chemicals.
And if you're quitting and reading this, you are too! Not another puff! We don't need to be the ones lining big tobacco's pockets while someone lines our caskets with fabric in production.

The meds worked great and since day 6 I’ve had zero desire to smoke. Love it. And my dreams are super fun! But I’ve noticed some other side effects that I think are related and am wondering if anyone else has experienced these. They aren’t major or big enough issues to make me stop using the Chantix, just different than my usual. 

First off, if I don’t take it with a decently full stomach then it makes me super nauseous for about an hour after I take it. Second, it makes me super thirsty. Like I can’t drink enough water. Sometimes my stomach feels full from drinking so much water but my mouth is still screaming for hydration. I wake up several
Times in the middle of the night desperate for water. Drinking so much also means I’m peeing a lot. Third, I think it’s giving me a bad reaction to alcohol. I’ve only drank once since taking it and I got about halfway through my glass of wine before my stomach started hurting and I just didn’t want it. This didn’t happen before the Chantix (besides the obvious drinking too much which I rarely did). And finally, I also think it’s giving me an adverse reaction to sugar. My mouth tastes really bad after eating sugary foods and upsets my stomach a little. 

I have a doc appointment next week and will bring these things up with her then but I’m curious if anyone else has experienced these things or anything else.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.74707997}"

So I mainly used 50mg nicotine salt juice in my vape. For those who don’t know that is a pretty hefty amount of nicotine for a vape. I used vaping to quit cigarettes, which it did work for that, but as it turns out vaping was more addictive for me because of the flavors and how you could use it indoors. Also because it wouldn’t make you reek and you wouldn’t breathe in burning plant matter. 

But since they recently changed the law for nicotine products in my state/country, it’s only available for people over 21 and I am only 20. I don’t wanna be that guy who always bothers someone to buy something because they’re not old enough so I figured it would be best if I quit. 

Since I was on the 50mg juice I figured I would get the strongest nicotine patches, the 21mg. It’s my second day using them and surprisingly they are working pretty well. They are keeping my cravings at bay for the most part. But since I’ve been vaping for so long I still feel weird going without it. I gave my vape to someone at work so even if I wanted to I can’t hit it. For the most part I feel fine, the only thing is that when I’m driving or gaming I still get the urge to hit something because those were the activities where I would vape most often. Also a lot of my friends vape so I’m always reminded of it when I see them. 

Aside from the mild withdrawal/cravings, I did notice that I had very vivid dreams while sleeping because of the patch. This doesn’t bother that much because I naturally have pretty vivid dreams. But it might be a good idea to take it off before bed, I’m not sure yet.

So yep. That’s pretty much where I’m at. In conclusion, it’s not so much that cravings that are bothering me, because the patches help with that. It’s more so about breaking the actual habit I have of always reaching for my vape when I’m outside or in my car or whatever. I’m not sure what I can do about that but I’ll just have to get used to it.

This was the second time I've taken chantix, the first time I took it for a month and quit smoking for 5 years afterwards. Recently it took two months of chantix for me to quit and it's now been about two weeks since I took my last dose of chantix yet i'm still having the infamous chantix dreams. Prior to taking chantix my dreams had always been very subdued and if I remembered them at all it was very cloudy. Last night I was tortured for 5+ hours in my sleep. Woke up, took a bath, went back to bed and ended up right back in the same nightmare.   
  
These torture dreams were relatively common while taking chantix and I told myself that the dreams were worth suffering through if I could quit smoking, but here we are. I'm worried at this point I fucked myself up to the point that the rest of my life is going to be like this and i'm kinda freaking out.  
  
Anyone have suggestions for suppressing these dreams? I try not to think about anything messed up before bed yet it's like clockwork at least once a week with these super vivid nightmares.

i've quit about 12 times in the past, and drinking has always been the thing that's started me up again. logic dictates that i just shouldn't drink for a good long while after a quit, if at all, but i would love to be able to quit and also enjoy a couple of drinks (when i feel really comfortable that i won't want a cigarette immediately). but that ""feeling comfortable"" has never come. 

it's certainly pattern behaviour - like when smoking becomes part of your routine. one in the morning, one after a meal... it's the same with drinking, but for me (and i'm sure many many others) the drinking one is especially strong because your defences are naturally down anyway.

whenever i start smoking again after quitting for a long time, i just go headlong into it once more. the habit's back, there's no way out, i'm so weak, i knew i couldn't do it, all this negative self-talk. i am also aware that when you stop, you stop: ""just one with a drink"" doesn't exist - it just has to be nothing. which is why, when i fall of the wagon like this, i get back into smoking so enthusiastically - because i feel like i ""might as well"". 

the thing is, i have a very strong desire to quit, but i feel like such a failure at the moment. i don't feel like i am ready to begin another quit straight after having succumbed again. what would your advice be? do i smoke again for a while until i feel strong enough to tackle the addiction once more? (with a series of supports in place for drinking)? or should i immediately try and give up again? i know that with the latter, if i have another cigarette during this second attempt, i will feel worse about myself. i also know that i'll be more prone to having another anyway because ""oh, it's only been 2 days, what's the difference?"" ...but it could also maybe be good for me in the short term because of how quickly the positive momentum builds up.

i don't know. i feel really hopeless. the will is there but the psychological strength just isn't, and i've started to self-identify as a serial quitter/failer. which, when i start another quit, might really influence my thinking too: ""oh yeah i normally get about this far and then start again, sooo...i'll just have one""

I tapered my nicotine in half every few days and I didnt get any withdrawal symptoms till I got to like 0.05mg/ml, and once that I happened I switch to 0mg fluid and felt uncomfortable for 2 days but it really wasnt bad, I think because of the chantix

I was off nicotine for about 40 days before I stupidly started smoking cigars, I smoked for all of Jan., in Feb I switched back to a 5mg vape and started tapering my nicotine in half every 120ml, I had no problems going all the way down to 0.7mg, then when I tapered it in half today to 0.4mg I not getting as much satisfactions from it, last time on chantix I was fine at way lower concentrations

I have 12 1mg pills left over, thats only 6 days at the recommended dose, and it probly takes a few days to help, so I thought id split them in half, so it last me 12 days, this is probably the best idea,probably still a effective dose, and gives me a few days to get accustomed to it, and more then a few days to taper down to 0mg, but its still awfully quick IMO

if I quarter them and take 0.25mg that gives me 24 days of pills, thats more then enough time, but im afraid the dose might be too low at that point

I made it for 6 months up until March last year but since then it’s been non stop giving up, lapsing, straight back to 20+ a day then repeat. 

I CANNOT and DO NOT want to go through this cycle any more. From experience I KNOW that life is better and less stressful without the cigarettes, and that I feel so much better without them, but for me it’s always “just one” when I’m drinking that takes me straight back to square one. I’m four hours into this quit and want to take this one seriously. 

I have learnt the lesson that there is no such thing as one cigarette for me, I am a proper addict and it’s all or nothing. I’ve heard the advice that when giving up you should make a list of all the reasons you don’t want to smoke, so am making this here. 

1. Health 
Obvious one really, but one that becomes a bigger and bigger reason the older I get. I started smoking at 15, when the idea of becoming ill from a smoking illness was just so far away and I knew I had years before having to worry about any of that. Well now I’m 29, turning 30 in 6 months. I always always said I would give up before 30 and what to start as soon as possible. The image of being diagnosed with lung cancer, COPD or heart disease that could have been completely prevented is just so scary to me, and becomes more of a possible reality with every single day I continue to smoke. 

The older I get the more I notice the cigarettes effect on my general day to day health. When I was 24 I ran a marathon whilst still smoking, but now i simply cannot run without choking and wheezing and feeling like I’m about to die. I’m fatigued, struggle to wake up in the morning and the first thing I do when I do get up is choke down a cigarette that actually makes me feel sick and dizzy. 

2. Cost 

Another obvious one. I’m in the UK and smoke roll ups, they’ve stopped selling any less than 30g so every time I buy cigarettes I’m spending almost 20 pounds which is just absolutely ridiculous. According to my tracker I’ll be saving almost a thousand pounds a year which is just crazy to me, as someone who is trying so hard to save up so me and my husband can by somewhere of our own. How on earth is it acceptable literally set fire to a grand, EVERY SINGLE YEAR? 

3. Just the sheer annoyance, inconvenience and disgustingness of smoking 

This is probably the one I think about most often. I live in a flat with a little balcony, don’t smoke inside but I head out there to smoke. Recently in the uk we’ve had really bad storms, horrendous wind rain and cold. Hasn’t stopped me though, been heading out there pretty much once an hour to get a fix. Just feel like such a moron standing in the wind, nearly getting blown away sucking down a cigarette. I never want anyone to see me out in the bad weather as I’m embarrassed about being such a pathetic addict! 

There’s also been a couple of times recently where my ash tray has blown over in the wind. This had dropped fag buts every where which have then gone down onto my neighbours balconies. How horrible to be “that” disgusting smoker spreading round their and filth impacting the neighbours??? 

I also work in healthcare, but still sneak out for multiple cigs a day from work. Always get so ashamed doing it, coming back in knowing you stink and people are judging you as you should definitely know better! 

Finally just the time it takes. The amount of times I’m pausing tv shows/films to go out and feed my addiction, interrupting a conversation I’m enjoying with friends to go stand outside on my own in the street, sometimes even when I’m enjoying intimate moments with my husband I find my mind turning to cigarettes, looking forward to it being over! 


Really really need this quit to stick. Sorry for the long post but I’ve found it really helpful typing that all out! I will be coming back here regularly. I always find it so inspiring when I see posts from those of you who have not smoked in a year or more, and in the past have felt envious! Just need to remember that the time will pass naturally, and if I can stick this quit out it will soon be me in that position! 💪🏻",10,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6670205}"

My smoking history:

* I started smoking in my teens and smoked regularly since high-school for 30+ years.  Generally smoked a small pack a day.  In Canada, a small pack is 20 cigarettes.  Quit and restarted many time.  Historically, better at restarting than quitting ... until now :-)

The early days (day o to 19):

* I chose a quit date that was meaningful / easy for me to remember
* I used Nicoderm patch (Step 1, 21 mg) initially when it came time to step down, I just discontinued use altogether.  I had about 6 to 8 cravings most days, some strong some weak, intensity was well mitigated by NRT
* NRT helped me get a handle on many of the ""situational"" or ""habitual"" smokes.  It helped me begin to be able to differentiate and actual craving (i.e., nicotine withdrawal) from an ""I usually smoke at this time"" type of temptation
* I experienced many of the negative things people post about, including anxiety, uncertainty, occasional difficulty focusing, feeling deprived and sometimes sad and sometimes angry.  I experienced physiological changes, for example  to my sleep patterns, constipation, cough, various aches / pains., weight gain, etc., etc., etc.
* I experienced the positive things people post about.  I have less of a cough and don't cough up scary stuff as much.  I don't stink of smoke.  My sense of smell has improved.  I have more energy.  I have more money.  I have more time.  I have an easier time breathing.  I am proud of what I have accomplished. 
* I appreciate not having to plan my day around smoke breaks.  I enjoy events and family occasions more now that I am actually there and not stepping out periodically.
* I am happy to be more in control

The cold turkey days (day 20 to 27)

* I stopped using NRT when I ran out of step 1 patches.
* For the next 3 to 7 days, it was pretty tough.  Cravings were more severe and more frequent.  Bad mood, negative thinking too.  Some days were brutal and I was not sure I would stay quit.
* They passed pretty quickly, but were more intense than I expected

Since then

* I had my first ""0 cravings / thoughts about smoking"" day ... for me this was Jan 17th.
* I have had several since then and most times now if I have a ""craving"" it is more of a passing thought.
* I did experience the ""it comes in threes"" phenomenon with the 3 day, 3 week and 3 month marks being uniquely challenging.  

What did / do I do:

* I drank lots of water.  I took walks.  I read books.  I ate.  I went to bed early.  In short ... whatever it took to get through the minute, the hour, the day without smoking.  
* I used the Smoke Free app.  I particularly liked the ability to log cravings (forced me to reflect on the experience itself, helped by providing a bit of a distraction to let the craving pass and provided a historical record that let me actually see the number and intensity of cravings reducing over time)
* I became a regular reader of and occasional contributor to this Reddit.  I sought out and read most everything I could about quitting smoking to understand the PROCESS, the steps, the things to expect.  I (re)read Allen Carr's, Easy Way To Stop Smoking
* When I feel angry, frustrated or deprived, I try to remember that I CHOSE to quit.  It was not forced on me.  Of course, this is small comfort in the middle of a craving / tantrum but AFTERWARDS, when I made it through without smoking, I was able to see more clearly that I was being deprived of nothing
* I try to force myself to deal with facts not fears -- for example, where a given sign or symptom might imply a serious problem.  I was at the point in the year where it was time to do a physical, so I did.  I spoke frankly to my doctor and let her know I was quitting and any concerning symptoms no matter how embarrassing.  She recommended two screening tests given my age and smoking history:  low dose CT scan and a colonoscopy.
* I use the diary feature of the Smoke Free app (no this is not an ad, I just really like it) to keep track of the day as a whole.  I especially appreciate looking back on the logs and diary entries when things are rough -- and even when they aren't.  
* I try to be mindful of each craving / temptation.  Given I smoked for decades I have linked or associated smoking with virtually everything I think, feel or do.  This is why smoking seems to be the answer to everything and its opposite (I am angry, let me smoke ... I am happy, let me smoke.  I am stressed, let me smoke ... I am relaxed, let me smoke.) 
* The work at hand now that the physical bit is over is to encounter and work through each of these ""reminders.""  I am hopeful and optimistic that the research is correct that many of these urges only need to be dealt with once.  Certainly I see this borne out in my ""cravings"" log where I can see the number and intensity of urges has diminished over time. 
* Most days now, I have zero or maybe just a passing thought about smoking.  Which isn't to say it doesn't pop into my head or that I ignore it.  It just doesn't ""mean"" as much / anything when it does now.  
* I try not to fixate on smoking.  It is easy to get wrapped around the axle in a spiral of negative thinking.  Over time, it becomes easier not to get caught in this spiral ... or at least, it becomes easier to recognize that you have and to try and break out of it.
* Early on I kept asking myself when will the cravings pass?  When will I not feel this way?  When will I be a non-smoker?  I wanted there to be a moment when everything would suddenly be different.  With the benefit of hindsight, I can see there was no ""moment"" but a continuous series of gradual improvements.  This is a process not an event.  

What's next:

* I assume there is a lot to come.  I will be on vacation in a month or so.  It will soon be spring and then summer.  Undoubtedly, I will encounter ""I usually smoke at this time"" type moments.  My plan is to experience each of these familiar things in a different way, specifically, without a cigarette.
* My plan is to stay smoke free.

This turned out to be a much longer post than I expected.  I am not sure it hit everything I wanted to share but it is a start and if it helps someone, I am glad to have given back.

Thank you everyone who posts stuff to this forum.  It has been very helpful to me and I am sure to many others.

I've been a smoker for about 21 years, started really young at around 13 because I wanted to fit in with the cool crowd. This desire also led me to become an alcoholic, but I gave up drinking last year in June and a month and a half later, the smoking had to go too. It's not easy being in AA and not smoking anymore, but this sub and knowing that I'm doing my lungs and rest of my body and mind a favour keeps me going.
There were a few times where I nearly gave in and I'm still thinking about it for the future. My cravings for cigarettes are always stronger than my cravings to drink. But I know if I give in once, I'll find more excuses to start smoking again on a more regular basis. 'Only to celebrate sobriety months.' 'Only on days when I go to AA.' And so on. And before I know it, I might have a beer with my cigarette. I can't and won't.

Backstory #1: Every evening, I tell myself it's my last cigarette. I decided tonight was my ACTUAL last one.

Backstory #2: My cat is very much a conversationalist. She purrs in different dialects and has even learned to say some words in ""english"" pronunciation (like when she wants something ""Prrright meoww!"") It makes it really easy to have a conversation with her most of the time, and she almost always gets her point across pretty easily. It sounds a bit wacko, but shes really a smart little psycho.

One day months ago, I explained to her what poison is because I didn't want her eating something with garlic in it. She got mad and I went into a fit, so I basically explained it as I would explain it to a 3 year old. She seemed to understand.

A week later, I gave her a piece of bacon. She was all for it and had her head in her bowl, mouth ready to scarf that shit right up, when I joked that I needed her to ""poison-test it"" for me. Her ears coiled back, she paniced, backed away quickly, and yelled ""MEOWWW!"" (translation: Why would you give ME the poison?!) I tried to calm her down and tell her I w as just joking (I honestly didnt think shed have remembered or understood our conversation). She *wouldnt* touch the bacon. I ate a piece in front of her to prove it wasn't poison. She looked at me with an annoyed expression and resumed her original endeavor to devour her bowl's worth.

She also purrs near scratches or wounds to help ""heal"" them. She does the same thing when Im sick.

Backstory complete.

Well, the past few weeks, Ive been stepping out for a cigarette before bed. When I come in, the cat is severely irritated. This evening, she even tried to stop me and convince me not to go outside before I stepped out. Aftewards, Ill lie in bed and over the past 2 weeks she will lie on my chest and start purring. I figured she was just being uncharacteristically cuddly.

But today, she gave me a look like I should have listened to her. Even a bit worried.

I think she knows the cigarettes are ""poison"" and is trying to help heal my chest after I smoke a cigarette.

I really think that's it for me.

Once for an entire year, but I started back the day my Dad died in December of 2015. I tried again a few times... A month here, a couple weeks there, but nothing ever stuck. 

Considering that my dad died from COPD, Emphysema... I suspect he had lung cancer as well, but he was a stubborn old man, and refused to be checked for it. He died a horrible death because of smoking. You would think that would make me have reconsidered my decision to start again when he died...it didn't. I was too blind to see it. Honestly, at that point I didn't care at all...

Now, I see...I have destroyed my body by smoking for so many years (on and off since I was 12...I know, yikes.) My teeth are bad, my health is awful, and now I'm dealing with some severe spinal issues. If I continue to smoke I will destroy the chance of it improving at all. 

For months now I'd been thinking about quitting, but something would always stress me out, and I would keep doing it. I recently had to move back in with my mother due to my health issues, and even though she is a smoker, and I have to be around her.. I decided I have had enough! 

I want to be able to BREATHE again. I'm tired of being sick all the time, the coughing, bad skin, poor health, and most of all... I don't want to end up like my Dad. I don't want to suffer for years and die like he did. I want to be healthier and give my spine the best possible chance of healing. 

&#x200B;

Right now I'm on Wellbutrin for depression, but I found out it is also use for smoking cessation as well. It's working for me on both. I am also using NicoDerm CQ patches that I'm getting at no cost with the free smoking cessation program. I also have a vape that has CBD 75mg in it. I don't really use it often anymore, but it helps with the need to keep my hands busy, and that need when I get a bad physical/mental craving. The CBD calms me down too as a bonus! 

Even though I still have cravings, and I am struggling a lot at times, I really want to do this. For quite some time I have felt so ashamed of smoking. I felt gross and dirty...I was getting more and more worried about smoking in front of others that it was causing me to have panic attacks. That along with the health risks I decided it wasn't worth it, that now is the time for me to make some changes in my life.

&#x200B;

 I really want to be done with this disgusting addiction once and for all.

The past month or so i've cut back naturally for reasons related to another issue I had involving muscle tension, it got to the point I couldn't tolerate cigarettes for awhile, i could only smoke a few a day, each time i'd feel sick af. Eventually that went away but I still only smoked like a half a pack a day or less instead.   


Anyway, about a week ago, whenever I tried to smoke a cigarette, i'd have a panic attack. Like EVERY TIME. After the 1st few drags I could feel the effect on my bp, i'd feel that rising nervousness, and have either a full-blown or very nearly full-blown panic attack. So about 4 days ago (i guess maybe 5 now, hooray) I smoked my last cig.   


First couple of days weren't TOO bad, but yesterday it really hit me, and today has been hell. I usually start my day w 6 shots of espresso and a cig (i know, 6 shots is excessive, but i've a tolerance). Anyway, i've been drinking the coffee as usual just wout the smoke. Today, I had HORRIBLE nausea not long after drinking the coffee followed by a bad panic attack. I had to go to the gym, run for 20 minutes, climb for AWHILE (im a climber), before i calmed down. And i've had this really bad brainfog.   


Like i have almost constant-feeling of disassociation now, or vertigo. Which I wanted to ask – since i'd been cutting back the past month, in particular the past week before i quit, since I could only smoke a few drags or at most half a cig, could i have started withdrawing THEN? Bc i started having sleeplessness issues and slight dizziness before I quit.   


Now tho, it's like mega-bad. I managed to calm myself down at the gym, went to a movie w a buddy, came home, took a hot bath which was very nice, now getting out of the bath i feel nauseas and disassociated af.   


Any insight as to whether this is a heard-of type experience or whether I need to check for brain tumors would be much appreciated :)

Take the bottle and just squirt a little bit on your tongue, I used both Frank's and sriracha when I tried this technique and boy did it get me through those initial hard weeks of my first ever cold turky (1 year plus). 
This works as a double edged approach, the heat will distract you and spicy food actually releases feel good endorphins, just like cigarettes.

Beyond black pepper (obviously a white boi) I wasn't a fan of heat at all until I got off the tobacco -2 years on and I think it's absolutely devine.

She's only 59. She's the type light a new cigarette with the one she's about to put out. She's currently in the cancer ward at our local hospital, and depending on some more tests tomorrow, they plan on letting her out tomorrow evening. 
She said she can't wait to get out, so she can have ""just one puff"". I called her out. I know one puff will turn into one cigarette, which will lead to 2, then a pack... you know where this is going.

I just landed in (vacation spot) yesterday too. When my brother called with the diagnosis, I ran my ass to Walmart and bought patches. I'm currently at 15 hours no cigs. So when she said ""just one puff"", I politely went off on her. I told her I began to quit this morning, and if she takes a puff, so will I. (I said this to scare her into fully quitting... I truly want to quit).  I told her we can do this together. So if she wants me to stop, she has to stop herself. And I'm so scared she won't. 

My grandmother has COPD from smoking for 40 years, she's been on full time oxygen for about 10 years now. (She quit in 93). My grandfather has cancer. Now my mom and her lungs. I can't handle losing all 3. 

Sorry for the all over the place rant. My mental state is crazy right now. We came on vacation to visit my sick grandparents (and do vacay stuff) just to find out cancer sticks plan to steal someone else from me. I'm trying to be happy and enjoy my time, enjoy my grandparents, let my kids have fun... but my heart hurts. And all I wanna do is smoke more, but I yearn to quit to not put my kids through what I have dealt with, with my mom and grandma. 

Why is this so hard? Will it get easier? I worry the stress of losing them 1 by 1 will make my urge worse, even when I do quit.

2020-02-13 12:26:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/f3ddfx/desperately_need_sleep/,Desperately need sleep!!,"Hey! 

A quick little rant I’m hoping somebody can relate to or pass a bit of advice on.

I’ve worked a night shift 10pm-6am for 14 of the last 16 months, the other 2 most recent months working day time hours.

I quit nights due to not being able to sleep at unconventional times during the day anymore. 

Now I’ve quit smoking cold turkey (weed and tobacco after smoking heavily and daily for 7 years with a 1 year off period in between). Im on day 13. However the first few days I was able to sleep normally but for the last 10 nights I’m falling asleep around 8-9pm as intended but waking up by 1am. 

No matter what I do I can not get back to sleep, I’m wide awake from the moment my eyes open but absolutely exhausted all day and can not bring myself to do anything that requires any attention such as watching a movie, reading, anything I usually enjoy really. I have been going for a 3/4 mile run each morning around 3-4am but that’s a major struggle as every 5 seconds Im having an argument with myself in my head over nonsense. I’m so tired up until the point I get in to bed and then I know I’ll wake up again in a few hours. 

I come off of my night shift due to being sleep deprived and have now quit my daytime position until I can sort this out. I can not bare to be in such a depressed mood around other people because I hate myself for wanting to bring their mood down to my level, I dont initiate this in anyway but I feel the want inside of me to ruin everything around me. I have no cravings to smoke at all but if I hate myself (as I will for feeing self destructive around people) smoking is a great way to reinforce the fact that this is true so why not start sabotaging my body is the thought process I have. So I must avoid company for the time being which is absolutely fine as Im not a lonely or miserable person in general. I do enjoy being alone not a problem. 

I just need to sleep, I’m going insane. Constant headache that feels as if my entire brain is swollen and bursting out of my head, feeling so disconnected from my body.. like I know Im alive and living but I feel completely dead. Yesterday I was contemplating what was real, questioning what I could see infront of me with my own eyes as I felt so far away from reality my eyes and visuals didnt feel like they were mine. I think I was craving complete darkness to curl up and sleep in for as long as possible. 

I’ve looked up other posts where other people have said they’ve struggled to sleep for a few weeks so I understand it’s normal but was hoping for some advice on what I could do to alleviate some trouble. I’m so close to lighting up a doobie knowing a graceful 8-10 hour sleep is waiting for me but I do not want to break my streak. If it’s going to revive me though Im all for it I cant live another day on 3 hours sleep and I value being able to function more than this!! The cognitive dissonance isn’t fun. I dont know what to do now. 

Thanks to anybody here for reading if you got this far and good luck to all of you out there that are struggling with the cessation. If I can make it this far enduring the symptoms I have, every single one of you can do this. I believe in you. Please be kind to yourselves during these times.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.73952216}"

I did once go without cigarettes for 1 whole month (that was 3 years ago, had been smoking for just a year when i tried it) but then one day while hanging out with friends i decided to have kind of a cheat day. The next day i felt like I'd just smoke 1-2 more before i fell into the nicotine trap again.

So the fact that I've now gone 10 days without a cigarette is now my 2nd highest time I've gone without smoking since i started which is a big deal for me.

Now the thing is I've not been craving cigarettes too much and the cravings that appear are very tolerable and i can easy go through them if I'm patient. Nothing like that makes me anxious or I'm not able to focus on what I'm doing and have to focus all my attention on getting rid of my craving. The best way i can define these cravings are like when you're in the mood for an ice cream  or something sweet (idk if that sounds weird but that's just how I'm able to put it right now) and the fact that i know I'll never be able to satisy those feelings of mine since I'll fall into the nicotine trap again makes me uncomfortable.

I'm also a very fit and athletic person who works out 5-6 times a day. There was a time when I'd jog 5-6 km and could still go on and from there since i started smoking i went down to 500m and would be gasping for breath by the end of it therefore seeing my stamina go down and the quality of my workouts decreasing was big motivational factor for me. Now since i quit i decided to start running again and see how much my stamina improved. 6 days after quitting i ran 3km. 7th day i did 3.5km, 8th day 4 km. Now i know this is supposed to encourage me that not smoking for just a few days have had such a positive effect on my health but i just miss the time when i used to smoke and see it as an excuse that if i go back to smoking i can get better within just a week and my biggest motivation to quit which was my stamina only took me a week to get better aftee 4 years of quitting. I know smoking has pretty bad long term effects but I'm the kind of guy who instead of taking precautions would try to reverse problems when they appear. It would be really helpful if someone could change my mindset about smoking so that i don't succumb to smoking again.",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5081691}"

Ive tried this and yes my craving for smoking was gone just like that. I think this is the best alternative and safest. Yeah you’re still addicted to nicotine but is that really bad when there’s no side effects? In a way we are all addicted to orgasms but that’s not bad.

I figured I'd share some insight, as I have been a smoker for 14+ years and have been clean since 2015.

I was at a pack and a half a day. My body had set up a reward system of sorts, on top of ritualistic behavior. Morning coffee? Cigarette. Drive to work? Cigarette. Late night gaming sessions with every hour being a break? Cigarette. It added up, and I didnt realize until it was almost too late that there was something seriously wrong.

My father passed from lung cancer. I had been going though the rounds of a new job, and although the lesson that I should have learned was right in front of my face, it didnt really hit me until it was the middle of summer and I literally had trouble breathing and functioning because I had moved onto a job that was much more physical than what I was used to.

So, I weighed my options and ultimately came to a decision. I quit for good; but not just because of the physical aspects, but the monetary ones as well. I told myself that with the money I'd save by not smoking, I could handle a new car payment. I was long overdue anyway.

The withdrawals were pretty bad, but the willpower and sense of reward was stronger. With the money I saved from buying packs, I put it towards a car I loved, and it felt so much more rewarding than the ""in the moment"" instant gratification that cigarettes brought. My appetite came back, and I felt myself enjoying life's luxuries more than ever.

To be honest, the hardest part was breaking the rituals. The social hang out smokes. The after gaming smokes. The after dinner and lunch and coffee smokes and the start of the day ones. I simply either avoided the triggers or found ways to replace them. Cravings don't last too long, so a nice round of pushups or even self meditation went a log way.

Trust me. It goes away. And it feels amazing. You can breathe again. Taste again. Have control of your life so much more. I would often compare my smoking situation to when I was a kid and I didnt need anything to keep me content. If you didnt need it then, you dont need it now. Take control of your life. And with that money you save, put it toward something you really want. It goes a long way, and your body and mind will thank you tenfold.

Good luck to you all.",32,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.42076087}"

I wanted to share my journey so far before I forget how it all felt. Here's my timeline:

1. December 2018 - got sick of smelling like cigarettes and switched to vaping:

Upside: immediately feeling better about the whole thing cause it didn't feel as disgusting)

Downside: vaping is much more accessible so I vaped more than I used to smoke. 

Goal: quit before 2020


2. October 15 2019 - crap, I've been afraid of quitting the whole year because it was never the right time due to my stressful job, took the plunge got nicotine patches and gum. Patches were for 6 weeks. 

Upside: During this time I was a little more irritable than usual and had to take a couple of walks to blow off steam when wanting a cigarette. 

Downside: the nicotine gum irritated the hell out of my mouth and I kept dreading the day my patches run out. 


3. Mid-December 2019 - stopped nicotine. My stress levels at work were through the roof for reasons unrelated to smoking, but the complete lack of nicotine pushed me over the edge. I'll be honest, I had like 3 breakdowns the first week and had to go to the bathroom to cry quietly and get back to work. What helped the most is going to the gym at lunch (I don't think I would have made it through the last work week of December without it). I then went home for Christmas vacation and came back feeling rebooted.

Best things about having quit:
1. I found out I can run for 40 minutes straight without getting winded... I couldn't run more than 10 before. My muscles are still adjusting...
2. The money I'm saving!
3. I'm less irritable... It could be also due to the fact that I'm still doing my gym time at lunch so I feel sane most of the day.
4. I don't feel like I'm forming my life around this addiction. Even with the vape I had to always make sure it was charged, that I had enough liquid. Dreaded long distance flights. 
5. Don't live in constant fear of getting cancer.

What I do when I'm yearning for a cigarette:
I remember how it only feels good for about 5 minutes and then I feel shitty. Are those 5 minutes worth it? If I'm irrational and my answer is yes I go for a run. If I'm at work and can't, I go for a chocolate.

Side note: I was listening to the Hidden Brain podcast the other day, there was an episode Creatures of Habit which discusses how habits are formed and broken. It's a good listen to motivate you.

Hope this speaks to your experience and maybe shows that yeah it's hard, but it's doable. My lowest point of having a 3 day emotional rollercoaster in the bathroom of my office wasn't the end of the world and wasn't even that long.",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.39502665}"

Am I crazy?,"After about 15 years of ""medium level"" nicotine use (a wide range of formats- mostly skoal and vaping then a NRT stint at the end) I finally quit right around the new year. It's been five weeks or so and it has been so much harder than I think I can admit to myself.

I have been so emotional and moody and it's caused some real challenges for myself. I have to assume it's due to the nicotine? I hope at least.

Maybe I was naive but I was hoping that by now I'd be in much better shape. I don't actually have cravings - I was using NRT lozenge long enough (and I really didn't like them enough) that it's not a craving - but my emotional balance just feels like a disaster.

Right now I don't feel like anyone likes the ""me"" off of nicotine but going back is not an option. I can't do it.

I was seriously depressed, became completely withdrawn from society which was easy to do given I haven't worked in almost 2 years for more personal reasons.

I felt like worse garbage than when I quit. I was having a harder time breathing than ever with all the weight I gained, walking? Forget it! Everything just hurt constantly. I don't know how I never just went back to smoking.

It has been a rocky battle that got WAYY easier around a month and a half, which was right after the hardest part of my quit.. the part where I had already successfully made it for several weeks and thought, what's the point of me quitting? I'm tired of torturing and want to enjoy a cig. 

Well guess what.. I went down to the gas station with my gf, bought the pack.. And she just looked at me like, bruh.. you already quit.

I just stared at that pack and we drove home. Took it and threw it in the trash. The reinvigorated promise to quit hit hard. I was at the very edge and said no once again after I had already made up my mind that I was going back.

Since then, it has been much easier. There are several days in a row where I don't even think about needing or wanting a cigarette. Occasionally in social situations, I think.. what could it hurt? But then I remember how much better I feel not having to constantly buy packs and smoke.

When you think about the sweet release of one cigarette, maybe take a look at a nearby ashtray. Think, I've probably smoked tens, hundreds, maybe thousands of cigs, did any of those give me the perceived sense of actual fulfillment that I *think* this cigarette will give me? Sure -- might feel good temporarily, but you and I both no,  in reality, no, it's a slippery slope down to addiction again where every cigarette is meaningless and you're hurting your health in exchange for money..

I know it's hard, and when I sit and think about cigarettes, I'm like. yeah I would enjoy smoking one. But the feeling of knowing I am not forced to go smoke anymore is just a little better.",17,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.58191967}"

When I smoke weed I can feel a little bit of that coming on, like a, tobacco is so unnatural why do u need it sort of feeling. Almost feels counterproductive to help my body with weed then damage it by smoking cigs twenty minutes later.

If it wasn't for weed I would've been in the same place I was 2 weeks ago, thinking I'd never quit, but now I'm 3 days smoke free! Smoking (weed) really gives you perspective on the cravings and reasons why you smoke, almost from the outside in. You can almost see the cravings and squish them as they come on because you realize it's just a feeling.

I successfully quit for 9 months twice (not pregnancy related at all; the timeframe just so happened to be that length). Each time I'd used the patch and tapered down. The cravings were *insane*; my mind kept telling me that they got worse over time, and I think that just kept me in a loop of craving more and more for the first 2 months in particular. I'd jokingly tell people they'd have to throw me into the bush for weeks so I'd have no way to access a corner store. 

All my other attempts - including other patch-attempts - failed miserably. I used services from my doctor's office that provided free counseling and craving management. I tried the gum (yuck); I tried medications, even one through a genetics study (both resulted in horrible nausea when I couldn't stop smoking while still taking the meds); I tried the puffer (which was just a hollow, unsatisfying experience); and then I went back to 'old faithful' and tried the patch again, resulting in me wearing a high, medium, and low dose *at the same time* while *still smoking* the last time. The person I was working with at the clinic was surprised I wasn't experiencing heart palpations! 

Some time last year my friend convinced me to try vaping. I can't say I was enthusiastic or hopeful at all, but I picked up a vaporizer for $45 bucks and some 20mg salt nix. I swore I was going to try quitting that week, and... It didn't happen. I vaped, and I smoked, and I ultimately preferred smoking, but I kept up trying to use the vape alternatively for a few weeks before I abandoned it completely. If anything, it became a substitute to wanting to chain smoke, but didn't - at the time - result in any major change. In fact, at the time, it convinced me that the nicotine wasn't the only thing I was addicted to, but also some of the other chemicals in cigarettes, as I still craved a *real cigarette*.

Come to today and somehow, some way, the experience is completely different. Honestly, I have to admit that my motivation is so minimal on the health-front; bad breath, teeth discoloration, gum issues, and smelling like cigarettes (to other people) does bother me, but I am largely motivated for financial reasons. I also worry the most about my mood being effected by the process of quitting, and in my job I *can't afford to be bitchy*, so it's been a huge factor in me avoiding quitting all along as that terrifies me. That said, I took 10 days off just to do this, and it's been... Easy! It's been EASY?!! Not that I haven't craved a *real cigarette* at all, or had the crazy thought that ""just one"" won't hurt, or even ""maybe I could smoke a pack once in awhile"" (a little over-confident there), but so far I haven't fallen off. 

It's early days, but on the morning of February 8th I finished my last pack and started vaping. I hadn't re-incorporated it into my 'smoking routine', I just switched 'cold turkey'. I had a sewing project that kept me busy (and infuriated me) for the first 36 hours and other than that, I basically quarantined myself to my apartment. I know others might find that more difficult, but I tend to crave more when I'm out and about, especially aimlessly walking between my stops. 

Unlike every other time I quit or tried to do so, my mind has been convinced that the cravings *are not getting worse with every minute*, but are in fact *the same, just consistent*, and that mindset is making a huge difference to my being able to deal with them because the cravings aren't worse, they're just still there. Beyond that, I repeat to myself, ""$400*, which is about how much I've been spending on cigarettes, which is insane. There are other places I could really use that money, which, in particular for me, is therapy right now, so the financial motivation also has a health benefit (one hopes). 

I am, admittedly, probably eating like a bit of a pig, but as someone who is normally on a ketogenic diet, I am being lax during my days off. I've got 7 days left before I go back to work and I think I can do this! For once I think I can really do this, and while some might consider vaping as not really quitting, I'll take it as a start to an end, because this is the first time I've felt capable of quitting while quitting.

Shared with some friends in high school to get a head rush, I watched as one friend struggled to inhale and held the smoke awkwardly, but it came to me easily. It felt like something I had been missing my whole life. From then on, I always made sure I had smokes. 

Fast forward a dozen years... I started to realize that things weren’t as peachy as I thought. I bought a dog and a bicycle. But I found I couldn’t ride very far without getting out of breath and my dog seemed to look at me with pity. Things were getting harder and I was tired more often, sometimes I wheezed at night. I also came to realize I may have been self-medicating a mild depression with cigarettes and they weren’t cutting it anymore. I started smoking more and more, but at the same time I couldn’t shake the feeling I wasn’t in control. 

So I quit. I endured withdrawal and honestly, it was bad. I didn’t sleep for three days. I watched sweat roll down my chest at night as my body ached and I ate mints constantly to distract myself. 

My mom, who smoked, came to visit. I told her about my quit and progress. She was happy for me, she’d tell me in between trips outside for smoke breaks. I would join her outside sometimes as we used to chat and smoke together. Soon enough I took a drag and found myself smoking again. But it was different, the smokes were never the same. I could feel the damage they were doing. I had never noticed so clearly the headaches, the short relief followed by anxiety, the chatter in my brain wanting another, the stink, all of it. 

So I quit. Withdrawal again and pockets full of mints. Before long, I was back to my old self and feeling good. During this time I encouraged my mom to quit too: if I could quit, anyone could, after all. I told her about Alan Carr, directed her to whyquit.com and showed her how my Smoke-free app worked. She would nod or agree, and tell me she would quit when she’s ready.

Then one morning I received a phone call. They thought my mom had a stroke, when she woke up that morning, half of her face was paralyzed. In the hospital they found out it wasn’t a stroke. The paralyzation was from a tumour. 

The tumour was cancer. It had spread there from her lungs. It was her only symptom of stage 4 lung cancer. She went for chemotherapy, but the doctors told us it was only to slow the cancer. I won’t go into detail, but all those things other people talk about were happening. After all, this was supposed to be something that only happened to other people, wasn’t it? Surely, not us?

My mom passed away a few days after this past Christmas, she wasn’t even 60 years old. Words can not describe the loss in our family. We were always close and I miss her constantly. 

I made it a few weeks after and started smoking again. I think just to try to feel something other than numb, or to feel closer to my mom who’s no longer here. It didn’t work and I can’t believe I thought it might. Grieving is hard enough, but now I’ve added withdrawal. At least now I can’t see how I could ever go back to cigarettes again. 

That’s about all I want to say for now. I’m not sure if this story will help anyone, though I hope it does. I’m not really sure why I wrote it. I guess maybe, to say that there’s never a good time to quit. We may never get to be “ready”.

This is the longest I've been without vaping / smoking. I've got a spray with a very small amount of nicotine which I just try to use when I feel overwhelmed during a craving.

I'm a pharmacist. I thought about sharing a story that happened not long ago with a patient. She came at the pharmacy because she wanted some advice on «how to stop smoking»...For my smoking cessation consultations, I always ask people why they want to stop smoking because I feel like that «why» will be the driving force behind your motivation and determination.

Her answer to her «why» : ""I want to get pregnant...I want to do it for me but I want to do it mainly for my future kid""

Her answer very much touched me. She then asked me to inform her of the dangers of smoking while pregnant...After telling her the risks, she didn't hesitate one bit. She asked me to prescribe her the nicotine replacement treatment. 

For those interested and looking for their ""why"", here is a list of the negative effects associated with cigarette smoking during pregnancy.

* Pregnancy complications
   * Fertility problems (male AND female)
   * Ectopic pregnancy (outside the uterus)
   * Miscarriage
   * Preterm labour

I made it a full day without smoking. The biggest factor to success was not letting my thoughts convince me that quitting yesterday was the wrong time to do it or that I for some reason ""needed"" to smoke. It was a constant brain-tennis of ""oh maybe i picked the wrong time"" or ""let's just cut down and then tomorrow we will do it for real"" or something similar. What helped me was to read in Alan Carr's book which describes these exact sentences and what goes on in the mind. It's always excuses and the little monster which are trying to make you afraid of quitting. 

I never need to smoke. 

From experience, I now know that when I take the first puff of a cigarette - I feel the juice hit my mind and body instantly and i feel a sensation of dizziness and exhaustion. One cigarette pulls my life energy away in just a few puffs and all it did was to make me lazy and smoke more cigarettes. 

Cutting down does not work.

I wanted to keep my energy levels high so I could finish normal chores throughout the day like keeping my place clean and washing my clothes etc on a daily basis so I started to withhold smoking until I've done work. 

This has been going on for the last couple of months and everyday was a bit of a torture. Everyday I would think about delaying a cigarette constantly. I would think about when I should smoke. All. the. time. The monster knew that I've already decided that I would smoke each day so he would just push me to smoke as soon as possible. 

Every time I smoked, It made me feel sick and lazy!

After torturing myself daily with head-tennis about when I ""finally"" could start smoke that day I really started to notice how poisonous this lifestyle is. The monster is real and he does not want you to quit. Ever! No matter what you do, he will always be there trying to tell you that smoking is what you need and he will persuade you however he can.

The truth is that you Never need to smoke!

So after torturing myself everyday, just to feel the poison and getting sick from that first puff - I wanted more and more to stop it completely. Yesterday wasn't planned, I just didn't smoke and my goodness did that piss the monster off. 

Today I feel much better and I know that I only have to not smoke. I know that every time that a thought of me ""treating myself"" to a cigarette - is not a treat but the little monster trying to convince me that I am missing out for not smoking and that I am merely on a pause and can have an occasional cigarette. You see - It's in the mind, it always comes in like that - Excuses excuses excuses. 

Well, sorry for the sudden stop but I have to go now. I will post later if you dont mind. 

The Soapman

*the rest here is from the original post on the 10th of February 2020:*

I'm reading his book while sitting at home having not smoked today but thoughts are flying back and forth while my tobacco is right in front of me.

I imagine having already smoked a cigarette where I know I will feel instantly tired, lazy and too demotivated to do anything other than just sit here and keep on smoking the rest of the evening pretending to have a good time.

My god man, I am on my first day and in my head it is constant Tennis! Thank god for Alan Carr's book - He describes it so well. It's just excuses on excuses to keep smoking and the weirdest part is the despair and fear of quitting! Fear of quitting cigarettes!!

""I have picked the wrong time - I will smoke only one tonight""

""I have to get in a better mood - quitting is taking too much of my mood and I need to perform better in my job""

and Blaaarh blaaarh blah... It's just fantastic what this guy says, he nails it. My goodness.. My thoughts are exactly these - Just a bunch of stupid ass excuses.

I am now going to take everything that contains anything to do with tobacco here with me and take it for a little walk. I will go to a supermarket and dump the poison in a trash bin there somewhere and I will go in a buy some sweet because holy smokes i'm craving something like tea or candy or anything just no cigarettes.

As a last note, just as I am typing this and getting ready to send it, makes me very nervous because it means that I am quitting cigarettes and the little monster doesn't agree to that so he complains because I didn't plan to quit today - I just didn't smoke today because I know I will get sick and lazy for the rest of the day if i do.

So, I'm going to quiet down the monster with some fresh air and cookies now instead.

It was the best year for me. I feel healthier, I started gym, lost 12 kg, stopped drinking, have more money to spend and I feel the best I have ever felt mentally and physically.
I often hear people say: ""I'll stop smoking when I get tired of that. I DON'T REALLY WANT TO STOP NOW"". Ofcourse you don't. Nobody does. That's the addiction speaking. You need to be strong and endure that awful beggining, no matter how hard it gets! Your future self and your friends/family will be happy you did so. BE STRONG, KICK THE ADDICTION'S ASS!

* Run, exercise, have a lot of sex, you gonna need a lot of endorphins to go through that first week.

I'm about to turn 31, and I've been smoking or addicted to nicotine since I was 16. I started smoking because I was a blue musician in the Kansas City area and was around people much older than me and often in and around bars and the habit was one a vast majority of that community shared. By 18 I had moved to Chicago and was smoking a pack a day. This continued for over a decade until the summer of 2018 where I transitioned fully to vaping. It wasn't easy but the availability of it and the price were big motivators (cigs cost about 12-15 a pack in Chicago, depending on your brand). 

Four days days ago I just decided to stop vaping. My wife was shocked when I sent her a photo of my vapes that I had put in a small plastic cup and filled with water. It was always on me. I had two of them so I always had a backup and I was basically breathing through the damn thing for most of my waking hours, I had quit smoking but the addiction was still there even though I had tapered my nicotine down greatly, the small hits of nicotine and the habit was so incredibly strong that it had become an extension of me, and it had to stop. 

What made abrupt halt easier was having 2mg nicotine gum at my disposal. It has helped for the past two days but when I do an honest reflection and moral inventory I know that I am just replacing one addiction for another. I look forward to the gum when I wake up, and when I am stressed I reach for the pack. It just doesn't feel good, just like quitting smoking for vaping didn't feel good after a while, only this time I'm seeing it sooner. 

I'm wondering if any of you have dealt with similar feelings. My thought process right now is that the combo of getting nicotine+the oral fixation are drawing me into another habit that I just don't want. I'm thinking the patch might be better for curbing the withdrawls and stress with losing the nicotine and make it easier to lose the oral fixation habit as well. 

Has anyone ever felt like they are addicted to the gum? Has anyone been on the gum and switched to the patch? Was the patch easier to get off of? 

My inclination right now is that patch+non-nicotine gum is the way to go to really help eventually break free from it all. 

Sorry for the wall of text, this nicotine/smoking/vaping thing has been in my life for so long and caused me so much stress that I just want to see a healthy end to it and the nasty habits I've formed.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4981983}"

I’ve been smoking since I was 13, so 10 years strong. At 14 I quit until I was 15 and dealt with severe anxiety and panic attacks and started dating this boy (whom is currently my husband haha) that had cigarettes whenever he wanted them. Well I was panicking, and he gave me one to “hit just once or twice” to calm down and I haven’t been able to stop since. I also quit during both of my pregnancies. But literally returning home from the hospital, that first cigarette again was my reward for quitting after a long pregnancy, labor, and delivery all mixed with not smoking throughout. 

So I’ve tried cold turkey. I had a couple years where I’ve had repeated bronchitis flare ups (I’m an asthmatic by the way). I can’t smoke when I’m in pain and can’t breathe. So in those moments I thought that would be my ticket out. But oh no. I’d pick up a cigarette again the first morning I felt human again. 

My weakness is cigarettes with my morning coffee. My ten year long habit and my favorite thing to look forward to. I have two very young children. Smoking lets me take a step back and breathe If they’re driving me nuts. Stress, happiness, celebration, etc. I smoke through it all. 

My mom was and is still a smoker, she smelled like vanilla, cigarettes, and mint flavored gum. All those smells are comfort smells. My husband, that boy that handed me that cigarette 8 years ago? He still smokes. Combined we smoke 1-1.5 packs a day. We share cigarettes, we’ve talked for hours outside together over a pack of cigarettes. It’s always been one of “our things”. 

He wants to quit, I want to quit. He never could quit while I was pregnant. I could never resist picking up smoking again. We have a tight budget, and we literally have a category listed for cigarettes. $100 a week for gas and cigs. ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS. We have two young children to obviously care for, feed, and clothe. And were done. DONE. 

But I need tips and tricks guys. Again, cold turkey just won’t work. Well but heads and crumble under the pressure and that day/night will end in an ugly argument. Any advice is welcome, trust me.

It probably would have been better to take it slower and jump off around 1/2 a cigarette per day.

My breathing problems developed around 7 cigarettes a day. The symptoms were mild. When I jumped off, the symptoms exploded. Starting on day 3, I was struggling to breath. I had to focus on every breath, like I wasn't breathing subconsciously. I was popping mucinex like crazy because breathing got a lot easier after clearing my airways of mucus. It started getting better around week 2 and got much better around week 7. From that point until recently, there were minor symptoms that popped up every now and then. There were times where deep breaths didn't feel good like they normally do.

After talking to more people, I discovered that this happens to some and not others.  If you do notice breathing problems on your taper, I would suggest continuing the taper slowly and not to jump off so early like I did.",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45403937}"

One thing that is extremely clear about cigarettes is they take your freedom away. I'm starting to suspect that is literal in some people because we can't all assume we are the same.

Neurodiversity exists but if I don't try to accommodate my own personal biology when a traditional approach fails, then I've failed too.

I know this is the sub for stopping ""smoking"", but I was a vape addict for around a year, from 17-18. I quit when I started getting dull headaches and shortness of breath from the vape, which I would need to religiously hit every 20-30 minutes. 

I am 19 now, and have been nicotine-free for a year, which has had many positive physical and mental effects. A set of stairs no longer leaves me feeling winded, and I feel mentally much more acute. However, I believe that this addiction fundamentally changed the way parts of my brain functioned.

I can no longer just be OK with doing nothing. I need to be constantly stimulated. Tasks that should take 2 hours take 4-5 hours because I am constantly being distracted by my phone or by anything, really. It's like my brain no longer cares about the urgency that I try to instill into it-- I can be up at 2am trying to finish an assignment, knowing full well that I need to wake up at 7am the next day, and my brain will still reach for the phone (or other distraction).

I'm worried that I won't be able to achieve my long-term goal of becoming a lawyer because of this propensity to become distracted after 20-30 minutes of work. Law school requires hours upon hours of case review, and I am unsure I would be able to complete these rigorous assignments if I am being constantly distracted.

I am visiting a doctor next week to talk this over with, and I'll likely get referred to a psychologist (or something similar).

After that it gets way easier. Of course the triggers will be infinite especially in the first 2 weeks but they're of a medium difficulty.
After the first month it gets really easy.

Honestly I kept trying to quit for more than six months and the reason I failed was because I couldn't believe that I could be a non smoker.
The moment I believed is the moment I succeeded.

Hey guys. Wanted to share this. I smoked since as long as I can remember. Started with only being 11y old (my mom was single mom & job & had to care of my grandpa and basically slept like 3h each night so... it wasn’t because she was a bad mother but when ur out all day long and spray perfume in your mouth / shower / throw your stuff in the washing machine there is no way she can do anything...)

All started with first smoking when 10 because my best friends mom was a chain smoker and he brought some with him and back then it “was cool”.

Anyways around being 13 I already smoked like 3/4 pack a day hanging out in the park - doing stupid stuff.

Over the biggest period of my smoking career I smoked around 15 cigs a day but the last 1 1/2 years it became really wild and a lot since I got my own business and allowed myself to smoke in front of the computer. It got so bad that I remember getting up - buying cigs and at around 1pm buying a new pack because I already ran out. I almost ate that shit. Swearing to myself every night I will stop tomorrow because my throat hurt and I felt digested by myself.

Probably for like 50 days in a row I went to bed “omg this was my last cig” just waking up to so intense cravings walking the walk of shame again to the cigarette store. The guy there - upon seeing me - already grabbed my brand because he knew exactly what I take (that gave me some thoughts too..)

Anyways. It seemed impossible to stop. I read Allen Carr / listened to you be videos - Blabla u name it. But nothing really helped me. Until this (I know it sounds so basic and dumb but I really believe that was the click)

\-> ever realized that 99,9% people say “oh I’m TRYING to quit smoking right now?”

With that you already give your brain a chance to fail and / escape because “u tried after all but it didn’t work right ? No biggie”

So from then on I told myself “I’m a non smoker / what do non smokers do? Not smoke / period” no room for error - no acceptance or error. I also told everyone I AM a non smoker - everyone laughing at me “yeah sure for 2 days again?”

So I told everyone I knew and sent in all groups whoever sees me smoking gets 200$.

Also I used Revolut (online bank account) and setup automatic fund transfer to a “vault” daily for 10€ (the amount of 2 pack cigarettes) and a Goal I’m saving it toward to. But the rule is - if u smoke 1 cigarette before hitting the Goal - not just the daily (10€) is gone / but all of it. So better make sure its something big enough that forces you to save multiple months for it. 

E.g Lets say it’s after 30 days at 300€ if u smoke at say 31, it’s back to zero.

I don’t even have any craving or anything. Been out / drank alcohol I even smoked a joint (with tobacco) which normally got me back the next day to smoke / but nothing - I haven’t smoked a cigarette since then - it even a puff - nada. And I couldn’t care less.

Hope to help someone with that mentality - for me it helped wonders. Cheers",39,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.54951155}"

Cessation isn't all about ""kicking"" the habit of smoking, it is just as much about developing the habit of NOT smoking.  When you have smoked as long as I did, smoking is the norm and NOT smoking is the habit that must be developed.  The thing that helped most when I decided to quit was to realize how much of my life smoking encompassed, literally every aspect from the first think waking up to the last thing before bed.

•Let them eat cake- I have allowed myself to eat sugars and bad food to help with the cravings, I can deal with the sugar later once the nicotine is under control
•not being around smokers- it’s taken away the strongest chances of cravings- this has been the biggest part in previous relapses
•being aware of what has caused previous relapses
•sleeping properly and being kind to myself by resting
•breathing exercises when really stressed or going for a walk
• nicotine free gum when the cravings and stress get really bad and I need something to chew on. (Not too often though as I want to be able to resist cravings as much as possible)
•knowing that everyday is another addiction free day and smiling about it- acknowledging achievements

In this time I got massively superstitious and made all sorts of pledges in my head including I’d never smoke again if the result could just come back that the cancer was contained. Luckily on Tuesday we found out this was the case and I was so relieved, and so resolute I’d stick to my promise. Fast forward to last night and I‘ve even bought Nicorette for the first time to help. First few hours are fine and I’m avoiding the smoking areas etc, but come 11pm and before I know what’s happening I’m smoking. I must have had 4 or 5 and feel horrific today, and so weak. Now I’m convincing myself if anything goes wrong with my dad it’s all my fault. Is my only hope to just try and stop drinking too?

The main reason I'm trying to quit is to save money. Spending more than £3k/yr right now which seems absolutely fucking absurd whenever I think about it, I can't afford this shit. Everyone else in my house smokes (indoors I might add, even in the livingroom!). The windows are rarely open so pretty much the entire house stinks of smoke, though right now I can't smell it really since I've been smoking for a few years. 

Nothing I say will change any of their smoking habits. I share a top-level flat with them. They're not gonna walk all the way downstairs and go outside just to smoke their half-hourly ciggy. Or even sacrifice their comfort to open and dangle out of a window.  

The longest I've went without smoking while living here is two days, until I caved in to the smell and stole a random cigarette laying around and then I was right back on them.    

I can't afford to move anywhere else right now. A month without smoking alone would pay for a bit more than half of a months rent on a shitty 1/2 bedroom property in my area to myself, which at least means I'd get rid of the temptation. But it's so hard.

(honestly, 3 months are as good).

I only went back to smoking because of beach vacations, travel trips, and other instances that where unusual to my daily routine, where I would somehow convince myself that this 1 cig would be fine. It never is!

**EDIT: This post is to help people quit cold turkey, not sustain not smoking. If you are able to quit for a month+ then I guess this is not for you. Cause after that one month it's all up to you.**

**Background**

I started smoking at 19 years old, I am 35 years old now. I am currently a non smoker who does not crave ciggies.

I quit smoking more than 5 times, but 5 times of those lasted more than 6 months.

1 time was a year and a half, another time for a year, and the rest around 6 - 9 months.

For me, the 5 times I quit smoking for 6+ months I did this:

**1) Really commit to the idea that you hate smoking and are ready to quit**

Every time I quit I do it because I know I love smoking, but I hate what it is doing to me health wise and I am ready to let it go. I hate how it drains my energy, gives me a heartburn, messes up my stamina. What do you hate about smoking?

**2) Set a date in the not so far future (3 weeks - 4 weeks and up to 3 months) (each time was different for me)**

This is honestly the main point that works for me.

It is helpful if you link it to an event in your life ( like graduation day, new born baby day, travel day) but not necessary.

The first time I quit I was in college, and 2 months before graduating I decided the day that I graduate I will quit smoking cold turkey. For some reason, my brain knew that would be the case and all I thought about during that time was how when I graduate I am done with smoking for GOOD! Lo and behold, grad day came and I was smoke free. (I went back after traveling to a beach trip a year and a half later, where I somehow told myself that this one cig would be fine).

The second time I set the date a month before traveling to a Europe trip and that worked really well because as soon as I got there I was so immersed in travelling that I didn't care for the cig, plus somehow that 1 month before quitting of self talk that I will be done with this soon really helped. (this lasted for 9 months, went back to cigs because of that of that one cig that I though won't hurt during a  molly trip).

1 other time was also related to an event.

2 other times were not related to events, but to dates I set, where I would be like: 3 weeks from now it is done / or 5 weeks from now I am done.

**3) Really choose a day, date.**

Choose the day, **mark it on your calendar** and write down the rules. Say I will quit on the 29th of february on a Saturday and as soon as I am awake I am done! Cold turkey!

**3) Enjoy your ciggies until the set date arrives.**

Enjoy whatever time you have left with ciggies.

So if you set a date 3 weeks from now, do not talk negatively to yourself. Embrace the cigs, love the cigs, because on the date you set, you will be DONE. So enjoy it while it lasts. The point is no negative talk, all positive so that your brain knows that sooner or later you are done, and BAM cold turkey it is.

**4) Say farewell to that last ciggie you smoke before set date.**

I always enjoy my lat cig before I quit the next day. I make love to that last cig, or 2 or 3 before I sleep. I say my farewells. I tell my ciggies good bye for good. I actually talk to my last cigs and tell them we are done. Sounds crazy, but that is what works for me.

**5) Throw any leftover packs you have.**

I throw away my pack and make sure I do not have anything with me. My wife still smokes, and that does not bother me. I thew my cigs away, I made peace with my cigs and I start my day fresh and smoke free the next day.

**6) Quit alcohol  for 2 - 3 weeks.**

Honestly, alcohol and ciggies are made for each other. If you are like me and smoke more when you drink, then you need to not drink for at least 2 - 3 weeks. You know you really quit if you can drink alcohol without smoking, let alone get drunk without smoking. I usually do not drink for 3 weeks cause I know that I will be back as soon as I have that 4th whiskey glass.

**7) Know that even 6 months in, 1 cig DOES hurt, and you will go right back.**

I can never give up so for me it's way better to choose a higher aim and get ALL the dopamine + novelty points my way. 

Everybody is unique. Find what works for you and if it doesn't work? You learned something. Yeah. I tried Allen Carr, Harvard's way, and not for me. 

For me stopping something means stagnation, but I need motion like an ocean to not be overwhelmed by all these toxic emotions that are very much the cause of addiction. So I'm still in pain and still abusing cigarettes but I'm also taking care of myself a little tiny bit more.

Here’s a backstory but if you want to know otherwise skip to the end to give advice/answer questions. 



BACKSTORY:

I was having palpitations when I was trying to sleep a couple weeks ago, so I decided to cut back heavily on the smoking/dipping.

When cutting back I would get to class and experience heavy amounts of anxiety and heart racing where I thought I would die. I felt like I need to leave the class ASAP.

I stayed knowing it was just anxiety.

I went to the doctor and they also said quitting smoking can cause this.

My first quit smoking experience lasts for 9 months, for me somehow, it was a bad experience.
I experienced depression and anxiety and OCD. Dark times of my life. But I learnt a lot. I m not saying everyone will experience these things but quit smoking experience depends on each individual.
After that I made it throw the first 9 months I felt into a horrible relationship. So it devastated me. 
But you know ... Once a smoker always a smoker.
I started smoking again. It becomes one and a half years that I started smoking again tbh I hated my self for each day of this 1.5 years. 
Today I said to myself: enough is enough man! There are things more important than smoking in this universe. Smoking is not cool. It's cheap. U stink all the time. Blah blah blah, you know all the bloody bad thing about smoking. 
So long story short 😁 here I am: sharing my journey with you guys.
I live in Tehran, Iran 🇮🇷 ( +3:30UTC)
Today is February 5th 2020
I set my quit date local time. 
I use quit smoking application: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.portablepixels.smokefree

Then, the addiction took over. Back on the quit horse and a negative emotional state led to just 1, which led to addiction running things again. Thankfully, only 1-3 a day when relapses, not enjoy at all but quenches the obsession that I cant fxn today wo getting this one morning cig. Quitting smoking has ruined smoking in a sense. Stinking Thinking tells me I absolutely need to have the one to start this day. And does nothing for me other than continue enlsavement, misery, anxiety and concentration.

Jumping back on wagon. It takes what it takes and I am ready. I know after 2 days, the house of lies will fall, and only then will need to remember never 1 again, remember not help cope with anything, in fact only makes it worse.

I still have no contact to my friends because I can't stand them smoking weed or cigarettes. It is still a problem for me when I am with smokers. I don't want to relapse. Even though my boyfriend doesn't smoke and is caring for me and there for me, I am missing my friends and hanging around with them and I am missing the joint passing around.. I hate that I am feeling this way. He has his friends and is more often going out than me. Sometimes I can come with him but not always because he has his friends he is making music with and when they celebrate they have their jokes and their past they spent together and they are making music and I feel like a total outsider..and jealous and it makes me want to smoke even more... I feel lonely and that I don't have friends anymore.....i can go on and on and I am really sad right now and don't know why I am posting this here, but I had to get it off my chest. I don't need any advice or something.. I know most of the possible solutions. Just wanted to say it to someone who is not my boyfriend because he is too worried and busy with his studies.

Ive been clean for 11 days so far

After a particularly bad flu I decided to quit smoking again. This time I decided to do it cold turkey. 

As per usual the first 3-4 days were full of irritability and angst and sugar cravings. Got through those few days fairly easily because Im familiar with them and there isnt nothing that some will power, sugar and sleep cant solve

Days 5-8 were harder because despite the nicotine cravings gone Id lost the ability to concentrate and focus to study for my exam. Cravings were being rationalised as “you gotta pass the exam, you can quit after it.” Still got through those.

Now for the past few days Ive just felt depressed. Casual banter with friends bothers and keeps me thinking for hours on end, somehow my confidence is tanking and taking self esteem along with it. Trying to stay strong and keep up appearances.

My approach and reasons why.,"I had been cutting back but suddenly went back harder. *rolls eyes* They are provided to me ""free of charge"" and I do have a little thing called Impulse Control disorder. Diagnosed professionally. This could simply be a side effect of ADHD or it could be more. Either way, I know I have impulse control disorder. 



I respect all of you that can put it down and do hold yourself back. I'm aware that it takes some serious effort no matter your neurobiology. For me? That's not going to work. Asking other people to keep them away from me since I don't like this lifestyle? Not going to work. They encourage it as all addicts of any kind will quickly find out if they try to help a fellow addict. In their own shame, they *try* to take you down with them. It also takes some serious effort to completely overhaul your life and cut people off.

 

The lesson I've learned that I want to share? Don't take on too much or be unrealistic. That doesn't mean continue. It just means what everyone else says on here.... forgive yourself.



I know my history. I know why and how I'm like this but that isn't enough. If you were following in the past you know they are literally radioactive and cause depression.



My suggestion for anyone like me? Go get some motherfucking nature. Increases serotonin. It's not some well hidden secret. It's well known. Change your phone light to not mess with you at night by upsetting your melatonin. (Notice I'm being realistic.) Almost all smart phones have settings to do this.

 

I have more ideas but this will be what I'm working on. I know I'm not alone. 
Some people have very little self control and the very act of trying harder depletes the resource that allows to try unless you are leaning on the support of others. This is unlikely if you are an addict as addiction doesn't happen in places where there is freedom, a balanced supportive social group and mental stimulation. Use? Yes. Addiction? No. 



Symptom not the problem. I was shown some true support on here and pushed away. That's the next thing I have to explore. Try smarter not harder. Life is hard enough already without beating yourself up and shooting yourself in the foot for something that isn't entirely your fault. 
Own up to the mistakes you make and learn from them but if you try to take all the blame to make other people happy you will fail because it's a lie. 



There is a song that explains the difference between a reason and an excuse. Nickel Creek : Reasons Why. I'm well aware I'm making excuses for myself but I have a reason. If I don't address that? Then I'm just being stupid but change takes time in my experience. As long as it's destroying me I'm going to do the same to the logical fallacy of learned helplessness. 

*smirks* That was a mouthful. 



Tldr; Get some nature, find support irl too if you can, forgive yourself, and make sure smart phones don't keep you up all night if you want to hack it. And you absolutely can and will.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.64572746}"

I am 29 now and been smoking since I was 16. Never smoked more than a pack per day unless there was some extreme partying involved.

But... I love(ed) smoking, I was so passionate about it and my whole day was centered around smoking a cig. Waking up and smoking while drinking coffee, taking a break from work to smoke, waited for someone - smoked, feeling anxious - smoked... I realised that I can't use cigarettes to feel satisfied and full in so many situations. It was like a nasty reward for almost everything.

It's day 6 now, feeling ok right now but yesterday I almost cried because the urge was so strong... I was trying to find any type of reason just to smoke one - but I didn't cause I would feel very ashamed.

I already feel physicaly better - it's fascinating but my old habbit is revisiting my mind at leas twice a day, manifesting in hardcore nicotine cravings.

We are awful together, so I'm out again...I'm free of vices 15 booze, 11 cigarettes, 7 all nicotine. 

 I'm broke and I can't afford to spend the $$ on alcohol or cigarettes. I spent $18 on 20lbs of brown rice yesterday and I cringed at the cost but justified the duration of food.  Wow, I used to blow $50 at the bar and cigarettes any given night.

I've been using patches, and there are times that the patch is ITCHING SO BAD I just want to RIP IT OFF AND SCRATCH!

SLAP THE PATCH? Make it sting???

YEP. Sounds weird, however, when the patch itches to where you want to rip it off, smack it to where it stings a lil under the patch, for me it feels like it satisfies the itch without taking the patch off, after a couple hours, it doesn't itch anymore. If itches again, slap it!
Did it fall off? Or just couldn't take anymore itching and ripped it off? No worries. Get a clean sock and cut the tube part of it off, and use it to cover the patch on your arm and it holds it on as it reseals against your skin! A sports band will work as well and not look so cheesy.

Don’t beat yourself up anymore. Cigarettes are not the worst thing to be addicted to. Cigarettes won’t make you black out and crash your car into someone’s bedroom, killing the sleeping occupant. I read about that in my local newspaper. It takes cigarettes longer than other substances to maim and kill you. That’s one of the reasons it’s hard to quit. It’s hard to see your life is unmanageable from smoking cigarettes in the beginning. But once you see your life has become unmanageable from the smoking, the question becomes how do you stop? Another question is how do you remember the progression and eventual suffering cigarettes caused when you’re feeling emotional and think one puff might not hurt? Personally, I use the 14 mg patches right now and find I need to supplement with zyn pouches when I have a craving to give me a nicotine boost. When I went down to 7 mg patches, I had terrible cravings. How I get through my emotions right now is to listen to Eckhart Tolle, a spiritual teacher. I need some peace in my life real bad. Especially now that I have a huge hole to fill that smoking created. I live in a cold area so I try to walk when it’s warmer but find I can’t exercise as much as I’d wish. I love to hike. Simple movement, cleaning or walking, while listening to music has helped me. I went to my university’s quit smoking program and got helpful advice about certain tricks to quitting that can help. I use a quit smoking app too. I’m invested in my quitting and take advantage of the internet. Cinnamon is pivotal. But I guess the best thing to do when you’re sad is to take action. Listen to an audio book on spirituality. Practice breathing meditation. None of us want to do it but in the end we are responsible for our internal well being. You’re not alone. So many want to quit. No one dreamed their lives would turn out this way. It’s ok to grieve. Allow the emotions to come and then to go. You’ve numbed them with smoking until smoking didn’t work anymore and now you’re left with you. The mind is a battlefield. It manufactures misery. Smoking only shut it off temporarily. Give your mind a bone to chew on: puzzles, books, art, music, games, social time. Then give your mind a rest: dwell in the present moment without judgment, meditate, pray to whatever you may believe in, take naps.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.45784914}"

I've been smoking rolled cigarettes for 7 years around 20/30 cigs per day. These last years were not too great for me, so smoking was really important for me, it helped me get through every day. But my life took a good way, this year i got engaged to my fiancee and i started a whole new career, i got a job in a local bank. So all in all, everything is good.

I always wanted to quit smoking, i have tried everything, gums, patches, medication, cold turkey, and nothing worked really. The most i got is 3 months. I just feel depressed without cigarettes and i can't handle anything. 

My new job is really stressful. We are always under pressure, there are lots of responsibilites etc. So, now I need my cigs more than ever. But here's the kicker: during our 10 hours shift, we only get 25 mins of break, once. 

I feel like this is the last straw for me. I want to quit bc of my health, bc of my job, i want to be healthy, i want to perform well, i can't do anything if I am constantly in a nicotine craving hellhole.

2020-02-01 13:22:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/exaab9/going_on_24_hours/,Going on 24 hours,"Hello again, here's my 2nd post in this group. 

In [the first one,](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/et5fs9/i_havent_even_started_trying/) I mentioned that I had not ever in the last twelve years even made a good faith attempt to quit smoking. I just wanted to share some updates with this fine community of present and future ex-smokers:

Going on 24 hours with no cigs!

Met with my doctor, and she was very supportive of the effort. She mentioned Chantix and Wellbutrin, though I'm not quite ready to resort to medication, as medication carries its own risks (the [side](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/chantix#sideeffects) [effects](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/wellbutrin#sideeffects) are concerning, especially since I already have a history of mood problems). It does seem like it could be a good last resort, but since I've never really even made an attempt at quitting, I don't even known at this point if it'll be necessary. 

Told doc I was planning to use a Juul -- she obviously said she couldn't recommend using a vape as they carry their own risks (including but not limited to: the long-term health effects are unknown; there is recent [evidence for concern](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html) regarding vaping; you could easily end up simply [swapping one addiction for the other](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/11/14/778936628/artisanal-vapers-for-some-the-habits-about-much-more-than-quitting-tobacco)). 

Picked a quit date (March 2nd). I feel like Monday isn't a great day to try to quit smoking, but is any day a good day to quit smoking?

In the meantime, I'm trying to give myself little victories to build confidence and understand what I'm up against. I ran out of cigarettes yesterday afternoon, and haven't bought another pack. I bought a Juul instead. My impression is that if used properly, this could be a useful tool for curbing nicotine withdrawal, but I can see how it has high potential for addiction as well, so I'm trying to use it sparingly. In any case, the urge to go to 7-11 and pick up a pack of cigarettes is still very strong. 

Still plan on buying a few more packs in the month between now and the quit date. My last 24 hours has been an experiment to demonstrate to myself that this is more manageable than I thought, especially with a Juul. Cold turkey may work for some people, but I've chosen to break the problem into smaller components. I'm definitely experiencing some of the withdrawal symptoms, but the really strange part is not going outside and smoking every few hours. 

Overall, I think quitting is an achievable goal for anyone. You shouldn't view it as a test of your willpower. Willpower takes energy and very few of us have enough energy to simply will ourselves into quitting. Instead, ask yourself *how* you can quit. Tell yourself you want to do it, and keep experimenting and trying things until you get there. 

Final thought: I think if you haven't tried quitting, you'll actually be pleasantly surprised by some of the upshots. For instance, I went downtown for brunch this morning. People are usually out with their kids, and I got to experience this without having parents cast judgmental glares in my direction. (Or at least, I guess I never realized how much I'd internalized the perception of other people's judgments.) I walked up a steep hill without choking on smoke -- small victories! Also, being February and all, it's damn cold outside. It's really nice that I've gotten to stay inside my cozy home.",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46635595}"

With that aside, I got prescribed Mirtrazapine (7.5mg) about ten days ago for my bipolar disorder and other related mental health issues. A few days ago, I noticed slightly lower craving for nicotine. I'm actually a dipper, using super-cheap tobacco powder. I only smoke once in a while. Anyway, I used to dip over 8 times a day. But lately, I get lesser cravings and I can go by with 5-6 dips or fewer a day, with lesser amount of tobacco per dip. It might be helpful to you. I wish to quit using tobacco altogether and stick to vaping (maybe stop that too in the future, but that's not my goal). Anyway, that's all for now. I'll keep you updated with my progress.
