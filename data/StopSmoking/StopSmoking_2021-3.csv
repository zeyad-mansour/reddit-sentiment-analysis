2021-03-30 20:27:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/mgtxqo/i_made_diy_nicpez_nicafter_dinner_mints_looking/,"I made diy nic-pez nic-after dinner mints, looking for other ideas?","I alternated between smoke/dip/vape for years until corona hit and gf locked down with me, I didn't want to dip in front of her so I tried lozenges for the first time and they were great. Nic gum works good for me too but chewing gum is in no way relaxing for me, I like gum when running/riding bike/driving/gym but that's it, no good at all trying to relax at night with some shows or reading but lozenges are. The lozenges were the missing piece for me. Problem was the lozenges cost me around $5 per day, more than a $3 can of cheap dip in a day.

I did diy ejuice 2010-2018 and somehow it took me a whole year of paying $$ for lozenges to put this together in my head. I didn't want to get into making my own candy so my thoughts were porous candies I could drip (basically) ejuice onto but also things that would be somewhat long lasting holding them in my lip.

For the juice, I ordered the strongest possible nic solution from my old normal supply website, 100mg/ml 100% PG carrier. I ordered PG because I thought VG would be horrible for soaking in to candy. I ordered as strong as possible because I thought PG would not be much better at soaking in than VG so I wanted to dilute it 19:1 with water or everclear. Doing some experimenting though, I found PG actually works better than water or alcohol on the candies I had, so I diluted my pg nic solution with more pure pg.

Diluting 19:1 gives a somewhat normal vape user strength of 5mg/ml. Going off of some internet folk knowledge that there are 20 drops in a ml, (maybe not) if each ml has 5mg then each drop has .25mg. I also added food coloring to better see what was going on.

https://files.catbox.moe/egdaa6.jpg
Here are some recently dripped on candies. The round white ones are breathsavers, those and the pez each take about 48hrs to absorb one drop and it doesn't go very deep. The after dinner mints absorb one in a few hours and are ready for another. I've wanted to do 2 drops for all of mine except the pez that are too small. After they soak it in I put them in my toaster oven with convection fan on and temp at around 120f for a few hours to dry them out.

The downside here vs factory nic lozenges is that even though the pg seems best at penetrating and soaking in, and after dinner mints are the thirstiest for it, as evidenced by the food coloring, it seems to only make it through the outer 30% or so layer of an after dinner mint, after that no nic. Nic only on the outer layer means the total dose makes it free of the candy and into your mouth quicker, that means more of it that gets swallowed and wasted or possibly swallowed and making you hiccup vs factory. It seems to be working for me though to just have a bit more pieces in a day of of my lower strength ones. (mine are .5mg, I was using 1mg factory nic lozenges)

I'm looking for ideas for other candies to try. (or other carrier fluid ideas) The only thing I've tried I didn't mention above or have in the pic is sweet-tarts, I tried them once and they took around 2 weeks to soak in one drop.

Edit: the money-math works out great, after dinner mints are $2/pound at winco, weigh 3.4g each so 133 pieces in a pound, they cost .015 each, 120ml of the nic was $25 with shipping and I'm using .005ml per candy at a cost of $0.001. 20 pieces a day is $0.302 per day, $110/year. The cheapest nic lozenges on amazon are $0.30 each, $6/day $2190/yr.

Also, I put the finished ones into old labeled childproof nic lozenge tubes when I carry them with me just in case I lose one it at least gives some clue that it's not just harmless candy.",5

I just want to share as I am so proud.

I became really sick in my throat and couldn't smoke for one week. I decided to go with it and stopped smoking for good.

That first week being sick really saved me, and couldn't be happier.

For anyone trying to quit, if you manage to resist the first week then it becomes gradually easy. But you need to be absolutely sure about it.

For me, it made me think how much shit I was polluting my body with. I went for dinner to a friends' and drank a bottle of red and smoked like 10/15 cigs. the window was open. The next day I had the worst infection inside my throat. It really hit me, how disgusting it was.

Now I can say I'm 25 days smoke-free, and proud to become a nonsmoker.

Quitting smoking is really not easy. I have failed many times. Somehow, failure is part of the process. Well, in any case, I wanted to prepare myself better for the next attempt. I read a lot of books, studied the posts on reddit, have looked at almost all apps and got help from medical and psychology students. This time I am more confident. I have recorded all my findings and tips for you in my app. Also, the app has a panic button that gives you the right reasons not to smoke when the cravings get strong. When the panic button is pressed, questions need to be answered (swipe like on Tinder for yes or no). There is also a picture for each question. Negative and positive reinforcement should help here.  In addition, you can analyze everything.  I hope the app helps you! Let me know what you think of the app. Suggestions for improvement are always welcome.  The app is currently only available for Android ([Habity - Stop Smoking! – Apps bei Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bamberger.stopsmoking)).

I have pointed my decision to my therapist and we'll work on the triggers - they are too many. Sometimes I feel like I was born smoking. I can't see my days w ithout a cigarette. I wake up and the first thing I do is smoking. Drink coffee or have breakfast, smoke. Lunch, before and after, a smoke. Finish any activity, smoke. Can't sleep? Eat the pack. Social interactions made me nervous? Smoke. Cry? Smoke. Such a beautiful night, I should enjoy it... smoking. Cool time with my friends, I must have a cigar to tell them an exciting story.

(Again),"         So, a little backstory, I have quit smoking before cold turkey. It was the hardest and most aggravating time of my life. I had been trying to quit for months previously and when I saw that my childhood hero, Stan Lee, had passed away back on November 12th 2018, I decided it was time. I had read about how he struggled with some addictions earlier in his career and overcame them I decided I could too. I decided to smoke 3 cigarettes back-to-back as fast as I could until I felt I was going to vomit. That helped me power through the first full day without even wanting to look at a cigarette, but the next two weeks were absolutely horrible. I had smoked for 8 years starting when I was 16. Then after two years of being smoke free I had a really rough day. (Family stuff) and smoked just one. JUST ONE! And that was all it took and I was back fully. It's been 8 months since then and I hate how I feel. I was running, exercising, and training for my 3rd marathon. After just one cigarette, I completely stopped for the euphoria and reintegration with my smoker buddies. Anyway, I want SOO badly to feel good again and get back in the shape I had worked so hard for. 
       So, ladies and gentlemen of Reddit, I am hereby declaring today as the day I will quit again. I know I am going to be a dick. I know I'm going to regain weight because I start shoveling food in my mouth to combat the cravings again. And I know I'm not gonna have the reset button on my mood that cigarettes provided me with. So, if anyone has any advice to help me combat the weight gain or tips to chillax when I get so unnecessarily pissed off about nothing, please PLEASE PLEEEAAASSSEE share your success stories or your shared grievances so I don't feel alone like I did last time. Thank you all and wish me luck! ✊✊✊",9

A number that I love and see coming and try catch in camera for future memory. 7777 hours ago was the beginning of a complex journey. Now can say that everyone need understand there will be challenges but indeed gets better. Until week 6 is very difficult. Until month 3 is some times complicated since you start imagine you got this. Never ever let yourself believe you can even give one puff. After month 6 no real more cravings, just nostalgia at some times when you are in a situation that remember you (the good old day times when was fun smoke). After month 9 you achieve the impossible. At this moment you have no cravings, no withdrawals. 9 months is the maximum your body keep the memory from the nicotine release. After that you only start smoke if you choose indeed start. And there is a thing. If you ever give a puff. You will think it taste so bad why you did smoke. But you might at same time remember the ones that you as a smoker did enjoy. I remember that few ones. And maybe try again. That’s it. You slowly will be again a smoker just because you did forget all you learn in the beginning. Never another puff no matter what. So the only think is if in a question of just trying. Try talk to yourself and create something that triggers in your mind to remember why in first place you decide to stop. Believe me. Is so good be a non smoker. I am close to 11 months. And will not lie. Maybe once or twice a month do remember the pleasure of smoke. But that is it. There was indeed some good cigarettes. The think is you cannot just have 1 cigarette times to times since there is strong drugs that induce you do buy more and more. The main is nicotine as all we know. But never ever ever when you decide to stop give another puff. And print that in your brain. If you start question. Watch maybe a few videos of what happens to you when you smoke. Believe me. You probably will look at then and feel more bad then want one. Good luck everyone. Yes in beginning it looks impossible until actually it happens and you start realizing you never be more free then after quitting. Even this call lockdown from Covid-19 look nothing compare to the eternal lockdown of getting enough money to buy the next pack of cigarettes until you die from that same bad habit. That is indeed a lockdown that you want get ride as fast as possible. Good luck 🍀",12

Well this morning I did just that. 26 days of being a nonsmoker and I just ran for 18 min straight. Not my best time but that is OK. Gotta start somewhere. I haven’t ran 18 min w/o stopping since I ran the half marathon 10 years ago.(I was smoke free) Stick with it y’all, there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and it is beautiful.",20

Been smoking full time since late April last year. I intend to quit now. My chest is wrecked, has been since about 4 months into smoking. However, I know others who have smoked for 10+ years whose chests seem to be much better than mine. Does anyone know why this might be? I feel like I'm constantly clearing my chest and throat. I wake up unable to yawn because even yawning induces a painful cough. I wake myself up coughing every now and then. I can't laugh without coughing. That used to be the case before smoking but only when I was in absolute stitches, like something had to be crazy funny for me to have a coughing fit.
My voice often breaks mid sentence. I probably smoke about 15-18 a day and maybe others are smoking much less? Or is this a sign that my smoking has aggrivated preexisting chest issues? Both my parents smoked for 30 years and my dad's chest was nothing like my mom's. He would cough a few times a day but my mom would spend most the day battling a cough. I would hear her coughing from the other end of the store and that's how I knew where to find her when we went out shopping. She has asthma as well so it makes me wonder. 
My partner has smoked for 12 years and his chest is nothing like mine. He probably smokes about 10-13 a day so perhaps those extra cigarettes I smoke make a difference. 

Any thoughts would be appreciated! I'm really looking forward to my chest recovering, even if it takes a year or more.",2

2021-03-29 09:04:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/mfp4lv/21_days_and_counting/,21 days and counting...,"If there's anything you can say about me is that I'm both ambitious and lazy. I want the best result with the least effort possible. When it comes to smoking the best result is being quit. But what would the least effort be?

Cold turkey: short, but intense. With NRT: topping of the cravings, but longer dependance on nicotine.

Most cold turkey quitters experienced the first week as the most difficult one. Now, how fast did last week go? Quite fast, if you look back, doesn't it? So the least effort, how strange it might sound, is going cold turkey for me.

One week of relatively intense withdrawal. But ending physical nicotine addiction behind in one week, leaving only mental addiction to battle. And how did that go? Well, better as aspected. I calculated one difficult week. And I was right. The brain fog left. The itching I had in my arms and hands disaspeared. My resting heart rate went down 10 beatings a minute. It wasn't easy. But this week was not impossible too. Leaving only the cravings to fight the second week. And the cravings quickly subsided. Leaving a nagging feeling in my mind. Not difficult to withstand, but mostly annoying. I had my first alcohol in this week. And even that didn't trigger any severe cravings. Twice or three times a day I take a few minutes and I sort of meditate: I tell my self that I'm not a smoker anymore. And I tell myself why I'm not a smoker anymore. Just to remind myself of why I'm going through this.

And this week, the third, the cravings almost disappeared. I'm alone at home. And I just found a packet of cigarettes. I laughed at them and gave them to some construction workers. Told ya, I'm not a smoker anymore! It doesn't mean I'm not thinking about smoking anymore. I realise a few times a day 'that this is a moment I would normally smoke'. For instance everyday when I wake up. But that is more of an observation than a craving.

I told you I am lazy. Short but intense works for me. But there's something else. Every puff, every single cigarette fills your nicotine receptors again. And that means your addiction is triggered again. Lazy as I am, I do not want to go through the physical withdrawal anymore. No more first weeks without nicotine. And to avoid that difficult week and make my life as simple as possible, there's only one solution. Don't light another cigarette. And I know, I really feel, this is the time.

disclaimer: cold turkey works for me. That doesn't mean it's the best way for you. Just try and find what works for you. Good luck. If I can do it. So can you. Believe me. And in yourself.",62
2021-03-29 08:34:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/mfolkn/i_quit_my_20_a_day_10_year_habit_of_smoking_with/,I quit my 20 a day 10 year habit of smoking with one moderate dose of magic mushrooms,"As stated above I quit smoking with one dose of cubensis mushrooms (2.3g) of  raw  dried mushrooms .

I’ve been a smoker ever since my early teenage years in school. I also come from Ireland where we mix tobacco with weed when smoking a joint. So any time I was “off the smokes “ I technically wasn’t because I still smoked joints on the  daily. so i was lying to myself every time I tried previously. 

In the week or so leading to my cessation of smoking I would tell myself constantly every-time I got a trigger of the craving  to smoke I would say in my head (and sometimes out loud ) “that’s crazy, I’m getting cravings for a cigarette and I don’t even smoke “  and if I was smoking 9 times out of 10 I would throw away the remainder of the cigarette once I was consciously thinking about what it was doing to me and how it would affect my body. 

I made the definite decision Monday morning to stop smoking for good on Saturday. I felt I needed to keep doing the reprogramming of my thoughts on smoking and how I viewed myself in general to give myself a better chance of quitting .

So Saturday came along and me and my roommates went on a light hike up the local mountains it was a fun day , but as always when going on adventures I had my box of cigarettes and 2 pre rolled tobacco laced joints for the journey. 

I became interested in mushroom identification and we where wondering the Forrest smoking joints and seeing how many species we could spot/identify.
When we got home I had already planned to eat the mushrooms then have some dinner.
I crushed up the dried mushrooms and eat it with some chocolate.
About 30 mins later I started to feel the onset of the trip so I went into my room and laid on my bed in a comfortable position as the trip got more and more intense with every breath.

I was tripping hard at this stage. My room was dark but not black out dark so I could see silhouettes and some colors from  the tapestries on my wall. I started to see shapes and geometric patterns every time I closed my eyes. (Very strong trip for just 2.3g I thought ) 
At this stage I’m floored on my bed and can barely get up off the bed, all the while I’m telling myself over and over again in my head that I’m not a smoker, I’m not a smoker...i....am.......not a smoker. 
Then the trip took a turn 
I started to feel pins and needles in my left arm and left side of my face  then down my leg and then again to my face. I started to get freaked out and even though I’ve tripped many times before I was still in need of some reassurance I was safe haha so I went out to my sitting room where my roomate was on the sofa (also on mushrooms ) asks me “are you alright lad “ and I replied “no man not at all I feel like I’m  having a stroke “ when he replied “no man you just eat 2.3g or shrooms, your fine just have a joint and relax “ .
So I agreed and went back into my room and took a bong rip and went back into my bed, the pains in my arm where back but this time a little more intense. 
I began to start freaking out once again but i caught myself in thought and said 
“This is what you wanted, you wanted to stop smoking  and you asked for help with the mushrooms, the mushrooms are showing you what it would feel like to have a stroke and this is what is coming for me if I continue smoking  tobacco “.  
It was then I got up and had another rip of the bong to get me high enough to try pass out. 

I eventually passed out I can’t really remember much after that but I woke up the next morning feeling great. 
I hadn’t smoked a cigarette the whole trip and I had no craving to smoke one at all not even a slight urge. I felt like the chain that was around my neck for so long had  just like magic vanished from me and I actually felt free.  

I’m not sure what or how it worked but I would love to find out more about how it reprograms the brain 🧠 
It has ignited the fire in me to delve into the world of mycology and to try and figure out how I could replicate my experience to help others who are trying to quit. But I genuinely think if you want to stop smoking. The very first thing you need to do is to  start telling yourself over and over again every time you get a craving to smoke the you are not a smoker. 

Thanks for reading any feedback from a scientific or psychological view would be greatly appreciated

I feel better and don’t have any cravings. I disliked it more with every cigarette in the last weeks, after I started smoking again in august. Every cigarette was since august the last one and the last one and the one for the mood and again the last one etc. But about a week ago it was enough. I kind of lost my love for smoking. No bad feelings, no good feelings towards smoking. I just realized that we grew apart. It may sounds strange but even though I stopped smoking multiple times in the last 14 years, it was always kind of “we’re gonna get back together someday” (and obviously did). But now it’s different. It’s strange that my relationship with smoking seems to be on the same page as with a partner but it’s the best description. 
I was drunk on Saturday, this is normally a huge trigger for smoking for me but even that could not change my emotional state towards smoking. I know it’s just a week yet, but I got a feeling that we separated for good this time. Goodbye cigarette",39

2021-03-28 15:25:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/mf7ww9/my_journey1_year_clear_from_smoking/,My journey...1 year clear from smoking,"I turned 40 in Oct 2019 and already had it in my mind to quit smoking. I would quit for several days, but when I went to the bar to play in darts tournaments, I would always bum them from people outside. Then I switched to vaping, but it wasn't the same. I still craved cigarettes. Then I got the first of 3 chest colds that fall/winter. I would quit for several days, get over it, then start again. Vaping, cbd, weed, cigs, I always had to be smoking something. 

Around that time I started getting random pains in my chest (mind you not deep in my chest, it was in my soft tissue around my sternum), but also had numbness coming and going from my arms. Doctor visits concluded it wasn't my heart or lungs, it was bad discs in my neck from terrible posture and just degenerating in old age. So I kept my smoking carousel. After the next two chest colds, Covid was upon us. I was 40, 5'10, 270 lbs, very strong from lifting, but also very overweight and right on the edge of diabetes. I knew if I got Covid, I would be at-risk for serious or fatal effects.

3/22 - a week after the bars shut down, I took my opportunity for a hard reset. I quit cigs, vape, weed, caffeine, sugar, everything. Also hard reset my eating habits. I had been eating fast food at least every other day. I switched to 3 eggs, cheese, turkey sausage for breakfast. Lunch was a deli meat sandwich and small bag of chips. Dinner was chicken, hot sauce, and dipped in ranch. Amazingly, I found that spicy foods really helped me get congestion out. Every time I ate something spicy I could cough up way more crap than I could any other time.

The first week was utter hell. I would be up all night sweating and going to the bathroom every hour or sleeping through the night, but then feeling like I was hit by a truck the next day. I was always stuffy, always tired. I started to feel my lungs open up and breathing was easier, but then after just a short conversation, I felt like I had super glue in my lungs. I was drinking three pots of (decaf) tea a day to try and loosen the mucus and get it out. But at least I knew that was working, I was getting it out of my system.

THREE MONTHS I DID THIS - one day breathing easy, the next day I thought I had covid, felt like I was breathing through a filter coated in super glue. I couldn't exercise very long or engage even in conversation that was too spirited. I always heard exercise will help you heal faster. I had seen DDP Yoga ads constantly on Facebook, but didn't want to pull the trigger. But something had to give. My moods were still up and down, I got lightheaded easily, lights were super bright. It wasn't enough not to poison myself, I had to get stronger.

June-July - I was walking/jogging every day (on good days at least) and started doing DDP Yoga to help get some semblance of more strenuous physical exertion. Strengthen my heart and lungs, my body, and getting more flexible. The breathing exercises really helped me push through the glue-lung feeling. I was soaking wet after even just the beginner exercises. I was finally having more good days than bad, but I knew I needed to go harder. I pushed through the beginner and intermediate ddp yoga programs, but wanted more. I got a used bike from a friend and started riding. This is when I realized just how out of shape I really was. 

The diet and exercise changes helped me lose 30 lbs in just a few months, but I couldn't ride my bike more than a few miles! I was only going around my neighborhood and I was exhausted. But I kept pushing through. 2 miles became 5. 5 became 10. By the end of August (5 months) I was comfortable taking hills and completing 10 miles at least twice a week. Glue-lung was gone. Everything was getting better.

The biggest thing I noticed is that any situation with work or friends that had previously stressed me out, didn't anymore. At least not in the same way. I used to feel like a surge of fight or flight all the time, that was gone. Now I was just focused and level-headed. Even when I got upset, it was mild and very easy to just breathe and bring my heart rate back down. Things that annoyed me still annoyed me, but I didn't feel the ping of anger anymore. I had more control over my mental state and emotions. 

Sept 2020 - 6 months after I quit smoking, I completed a 20 mile bike ride. Something I had never done (at least not since I was a kid). I completed an advanced 60 min DDP Yoga workout with an average HR of 125 (when I started I was constantly over 140 just for beginner). My bike ride HR was 170+ when I started going just 2 miles, my 20 mile ride was around 150bpm. My resting heart rate dropped from 79 to 65. 

Since the cold weather moved in I did some indoor bike-trainer riding, but mostly concentrated on going to the gym (going late before they close there is almost no one there). I can not believe how much endurance I have. I was lifting heavy for 30 mins or so at the start. Now in March 2021 I can go an hour or more of heavy lifting and still have energy for more. I'm back to squatting and benching more than I could at 25.

My suggestions for new quitters: drink tons of fluids. My regimen was a pot of tea/electrolytes. I would put two bigelow benefits tea bags and 1 packet of electrolytes to a coffee pot and then use the coffeemaker to fill with hot water. I also used cbd drops under my tongue or edibles to ease my anxiety. Tons of stretching, yoga is great. DDP yoga has a mix of flexibility and strength training so it was a good program for me. Also, you're not alone. I was on this sub constantly asking questions and interacting with other quitters. I also downloaded a stop smoking app to help give me goals to strive for. Even after a year clear, I still cough stuff up occasionally, my body is still adjusting to clear, healthier lungs.

If anyone has any questions about anything, let me know. I'm on this wagon for good.",18

I want all of you to have this too.,"""I just want to, generally, take better care of my body this year."" I said to my SO at 12:01 on January first, after she asked what my New Year's resolution was. I hadn't thought about it. I don't like the concept of a new year's resolution so I just blurted out the first half-assed answer that popped into my head. My SO got excited and answered, ""Me too! I was thinking about doing dry January. Do you want to join me?"" I felt embarrassed. I knew she was delicately addressing my behavior. 

Over the previous 9 months I had fixed myself into a daily routine of tall boys and cigarettes.  I watched my career and hard work over the past three years all but vanish during the covid lockdown. Beer and cigarettes felt like the only thing I could control. And it became my daily practice. I agreed that dry January was a good idea, but I was secretly afraid that I couldn't handle the boredom of the lockdown without booze. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find dry January was much easier than I anticipated. I also realized that smoking cigarettes was way less enjoyable when I was sober. In fact, it was kind of a chore to have to step outside in the middle of winter to inhale smoke for five minutes then try to figure out where to throw the butt, because the ash trey was already full and if I actually emptied the ash trey that'd be like admitting that I'm a real smoker so instead 'd stuff it in this little paint can next to the shed which was also almost full of soggy butts. I finally started to realize the depth of my nicotine addiction. I had to get myself drunk just so I could actually enjoy my next cigarette. You don't think so much about popping by the night shop for more cigarettes when you've got a little buzz on. 

However, the moment February rolled around I hopped right back into my little routine of three or four beers to accompany my three or four cigarettes on weeknights, and ""see-you-later"" on the weekend. Then on February 7th my SO's brother was diagnosed with cancer. My SO's father had beaten cancer only to succumb to a blood infection a few years later, and one of her closest male friends died of cancer four years ago. And here she had to watch me, the love of her life, smoking cigarettes alone on the patio every day. That was the day I quit. No big announcements, no ""this is my last cigarette I'm going to remember this"". I quietly thew the empty pack away and didn't buy another one. I joined this sub, bought the overpriced green 💚 stop smoking app and started my journey. I was terrified. I was most afraid of what to do with the boredom. What to do with the silence of the lockdown. 


Quitting smoking has given me confidence that I have way more control over my life than I thought. Before, nearly every routine in my life was built around my next cigarette. After I quit it felt like, ""ok. Now, when do I get out of bed? When do I make coffee? When do I eat something? When do I give myself a little break? When do I bathe? When do I start drinking alcohol?"" 

Since quitting smoking, I feel like I've been given a totally clean slate. Before, I felt powerless. Like I had no control over my addiction or anything else for that matter. Now I have a strict routine that I follow during the week. The Best part is that I made it myself. And that's the rub! I have a positive daily routine in my life which includes daily workouts, language learning (I live in a foreign country and have been putting this off for a long time), a specific diet/meal plan, and time for professional networking and development. I finish every day feeling like I've accomplished something. On the weekends I splurge on food, and a few beers but I don't feel the need to become intoxicated just to improve my nicotine buzz. I find myself looking forward to the coming week so I can jump back into my self-made routine. Quitting smoking is the best decision anyone will ever make for themselves. I want everyone to feel empowered like I have.",26

They did an EKG and took x-rays. Doc said everything looked fine and I was given an ibuprofen and some Lorazepam for the anxiety and was sent home.

The next day my wife and I decided to quit cold turkey. We’re on day 4 and thankfully it hasn’t been that bad for us. However, I’ve had a tightness in my chest and pain in my back since the panic attack that started all of this. I’m sure it’s just anxiety, but every time my chest tightness becomes noticeable I start getting stressed that the doctor might have missed something.

I want to share a technique that might help some of us. I was following this idea without knowing that it is actually a [research-backed technique](https://www.nirandfar.com/goal-setting-hack/).

The method is straightforward. The main idea is to **make it unsatisfying**. This will work well for short/medium-term goals. If you repeatedly practise this method, you can end up stop smoking.

1- Decide a duration that you want to stay away from smoking. - 1 month

2- Commit money that makes you uncomfortable to lose. Make this amount visible to you. - $500

3- If you smoke before your deadline, burn this money. Actually, burn it with a lighter. You've lost.

4- If you achieve your goal, take it back. Spend it to have fun.

Losing money (**making it unsatisfying**) motivates some people. There might be additional ways to practice this method on top of focusing on money. This is a framework that can help some people to control their smoking habits.

*Disclaimer - I've built below application*

[Habit Cycle](https://apps.apple.com/app/habit-cycle/id1537253621?l=en) implements Burn or Burn technique. Rather than 'burning' your money, the app donates it to any charity you want if you fail.

Had a cigarette first thing every morning and between 8 and 20 after that every day of my adult life. Grew up in a smoky household so this is genuinely the first time in my entire life I have lived in a smoke free environment. I have found it much easier than I anticipated, having never tried to quit before. I believe it is getting to the point of actually quitting which is harder. It is worth saying I have also not touched any alcohol in 3 and a half years and found the withdrawals from alcohol dependency and subsequent road of recovery far more intense and terrifying than nicotine withdrawal, not to undermine the struggle for people who've not experienced D.Ts before and have nothing to compare giving up smoking to that is worse. I know it sounds ridiculous but I have managed to quit whilst going thru a break up with partner of 6 years and battling with PTSD and Bipolar Disorder. I have a system, also probably sounds ridiculous.. I gave up meat when I gave up booze. Healthier lifestyle but also because I knew if I was craving booze I would have a bacon sandwich or a steak instead before I caved in and had a drink, a sort of less dangerous buffer of discipline to break before relapsing. I didnt drink any booze nor eat any meat. Now with cigarettes I decided at the same time to give up Caffeine and go temporarily vegan too at the same time. I have had some chocolate and some cheese when I have felt really shit but not had a cig or a coffee the whole time. I guess smoking is a buffer for drinking booze, like before I drink i may as well have a cigarette but before that i may aswell have a bacon sandwich but before that a cheese toastie etc etc..

That's always working for the first few ""special occasions"" and them I'm hooked again.

So, here I am once again having just finished my last cigarette and already looking forward to that constant headache going away again, my nose not being as stuffy anymore, having more energy and more money.",14

I've quit smoking 34 days ago (being a 5+ years smoker) I am 22 years old and I quit without using any other nicotine helpers like tabs...

I have a question about the symptoms could they be from stopping smoking. My stomach hurts and I have acid reflux almost every day I feel nauseous but I never throw up like every day for the past 7-10 days

And also my head hurts past 10ish days. Could this be related? I'm asking cause I don't know should I visit a doctor with covid being around trying not to.

Thanks",2

 I've been a smoker for 3 years now and ever since day 1 I wanted to quit. From time to time I tried to stop but mostly failed after 2 or 3 days... There was always an excuse...
 Ffw I've met the woman of my life. I honestly love her with all my heart. Now we have been together for almost 2 years, but I knew from the beginning that she really hates smoking. I knew that I couldn't continue but she was okay with it (at first). The more time progressed, the more I realised how bad she felt. She told me she couldn't handle our relationship because she was scared that I'd die early.
 So after that we broke up. She told me that she loves me but there are too many things about me, that she can not handle. That I have to handle them myself at first.
 The thing is, everything she mentioned, I've wanted to change myself. So I deeply regret that it had to come this far and wanted it all to change to get her back. 
 Now we got back and I'm 9 days smoke free! I'm really happy about that and so proud of myself. The problem is that, with everything else going on in my life (my family, university and recent losts) I feel so much pressure... I want to quit smoking but I know that if I couldn't make it I would lose her again.
 I don't know what to do. I'm home alone at the moment (she's at her familys house) and learning all the time. The urge is just too big and the stress...

Hi everyone,

I've been smoking for about the past ten years. On average I'd say that a pack lasted for about a week and a half at first while now it's a bit less than a week.
Depending on the period I would also sometimes almost not smoke at all and sometimes smoke an awful lot, classic situations I guess.

The thing is, I enjoy smoking, I really do and I feel like I'm in this thin spot where I don't have a physical addiction and don't really want to completely stop but also I'm so used to smoke socially and to also do it as a reflex on some situation, that it feels like I'm too close of letting it control me. So everytime I think I should stop I do it again after about a week or less. 

Everytime, when a friend offers me a cigarette that's when I have trouble saying no. I can go days or even weeks without smoking on my own and as soon as a friend or colleague offers a cig I can't get myself to say no. I want to precise that not one of them insist, I'm the one who say yes right away.

I'll be 30 by the end of the week and thought to myself ""dude you should stop, that'll be a nice gift from you to you"". And today, when a colleague offered me a cigarette I, for once, said ""no thanks"". Damn I could have smoke that bastard but also a couple minutes later I've already forget about and felt quite good about it. 

That's it. Just a small thing that felt quite good for me and that I  wanted to share.",11

I started vaping nicotine roughly 2-3 years ago and have been doing so consistently ever since. I never thought I was doing any damage to my body and to be quite honest, I still don't. But it sucks having to wake up every morning looking for my suorin or puff bars or nic sticks just to get that one hit in the morning to get that feeling. It's gotten so bad to the point where I would charge up dead puff bars or continue to hit burnt pods just to get some feeling. I don't want to wait until I reach a certain point where I do damage beyond repair. I don't want to rely on nicotine to dictate my morning routines anymore and to panic if I can't find it. 

One of the fears I currently have going forward on this journey is how engrained it is into my system. For the past 2-3 years I hit my nic device the moment I wake up, while I'm driving, while i'm gaming, after a meal, while drinking, before I sleep, if im bored, if I'm stressed/sad, etc. I don't want to fall back into those old habits. Fortunately I have been using a vicks vapoinhaler which kind of helps. My juice was typically mint or mentholly so having the vapoinhaler really helps. I can use all the tips and support I can get. 

I want to quit.

Sometimes with my lungs filled with smoke I am saying to my self “That’s it I’m done” only to find myself few hours later in need for another puff.

Looking for hope, nothing will be happening CT despite reading Allen Carr.","Hey everyone. I'll keep it short. I'm going to be 19 in May. I've been smoking pretty much non-stop since I was 14 years old. I have two 10-month quits that I threw away into the garbage pail due to severely traumatic events (first something bad happened in my family and the second time my long-term girlfriend was cheating and left me for another dude) and both times I went back I've gone back like I never stopped.

I was successful in quitting with the patches - twice for 10 months each - back when I only smoked a pack a day and 21 mg. was enough for 24 hours. Long story short, I have 20 months of non-smoking/no gum and 28 months of smoking heavy heavy.

Fast forward to right now. I go through anywhere between 2-3 packs' worth of nicotine in a day. I don't even smoke cigarettes, I vape and use it like a cigarette by stepping outside and not using it indoors. I still will go through 2-3 Myle Minis or 2-3 JUUL pods a day, with my upper extreme being 3.5 packs worth daily on a terrible, no-good very-bad day.

A pod is just gone in 5-7 hours for me. An **unfiltered** pack of smokes is gone within 12 hours, because whenever I smoke I rip the cellulose out of the long cigs and smoke them down to the filter.

I need to give this terrible habit up yesterday because I hate myself every time I do it. However, I'm so dependent I know I could never do it cold. Period, don't tell me I can because - well - I'm not Mr. Allen Carr with his 100 cigarette a day habit who can just give it up and be done with it.

I've read the book more than once and I keep that energy for about a week before I just cave. I don't even count my week-long breaks from nicotine because I only used one 21 mg. patch and failed every time. It's pathetic and I might as well not be wearing just one patch because the cravings are just as intense as they are CT.

As you might imagine, I haven't tried to quit in a long time, and now my nicotine consumption is intolerable.

Question for everyone - has anyone successfully used a 42 mg. patch equivalent to start off with and tapered down from there?

Please don't come in the comments telling me to just throw it away and read the stupid book again, I have bipolar II disorder and I'll end up in prison or the hospital if I go CT because I'll do some shit I regret. Nicotine is an emotional stabilizer for me.

70% of bipolar people smoke until they die of cancer and I don't want to be one of them anymore.

I got heavily into smoking cigs because they helped me stop self-harming and flipping out in public. Before I decided to cut or harm, I'd have a cigarette and not do it instead because I felt better. Without the nicotine I completely flip out and I'm hurting myself guaranteed. I've been through that before, and I'm not in control of it.

I don't give a fuck what Allen Carr says, I can't go CT. It will kill me, literally, because I will almost definitely take another suicide attempt. 

I got the meat from the book and spit out the bones, but he is definitely right about mostly everything. However, he does not suffer from severe mental illness like myself and probably more than a few people on this subreddit.

Therefore, I want this nicotine shit out of my life for good and this needs to be my last quit because I will never ever ever have another one in me again and I'll die at 40 smoking 8 pods or packs a day if I fail this time around. I know it.

I will get myself mentally stable with a new psychiatrist that I am seeing throughout the NRT process. **If I start chewing the gum, I will switch my habit entirely and therefore I am not interested in chewing the gum in any form.** **I have no self-control and will not use the gum responsibly.** I do not want immediate short-term craving relief because I will seek it out forever.

**As for Chantix, it will drive me to suicide.** It's not an option, because being on SSRIs makes me insane and I make consecutive, weeks-long daily attempts on my life with lethal drugs like fentanyl and vodka put together. I have tried 4 different SSRIs and I've tried to assault people or kill myself on every single one of them.

Been there done that. Shouldn't actually be breathing right now with all the different ways I've tried to die in the midst of mania.

Don't want to do that kind of shit ever again as I am in recovery from all illicit substances and I want to stay clean. I need to stay out of the psych ward. I want to live and be happy with myself. **I am relatively stable right now on Seroquel, Lithium and Gabapentin and I haven't made an attempt on my life or used fentanyl/drank vodka  in the 7 months since I got out of my second and final psych ward. They gave me that medicine and it seems to be working today.**

Please send hope and encouragement, I feel like I'm completely doomed if people don't actually taper more than one patch at a time and it's not the right thing to do.",8

It has been two weeks and I still think about them constantly. I talk about them, I dream about them. Instead of trying to suppress these thoughts like I used to do, I let these fixations roll through my mind. I think about every cigarette I ever smoked. The cigarette that started it all, a Camel filter, burning between my fingers while discussing art with a roommate on the back porch of our rented Florida townhouse. The 4th of July cigarette that saved my life, or at least my face; rolling up my car’s windows to light it kept a bottle rocket from igniting my head. The first cigarette after a year and a half of abstaining for pregnancy was given to me by a bad friend and tasted like delicious guilt. And of course my last cigarette. A hastily rolled cigarette made from stale, loose tobacco that tasted like shit and felt entirely unceremonious.

I am brand new to Reddit but stumbled on this sub in my research on quitting. I’ve read through so many posts and I’m hoping to be an active part of this awesome supportive community. 

I am 29 years old and have smoked since I was 18. I’ve never even tried to quit before, aside from a three day break after getting my wisdom teeth out. I smoke a little less than a pack a day. I’ve always hated that I smoke. I’ve been embarrassed by it and ashamed. I never had many smoker friends, so I always felt like the odd one out. In the past whenever I’ve thought about quitting, I’ve been immediately filled with anxiety and quickly disregarded the idea. But for some reason, it came into my head again this week and I felt determined. Scared, too. But determined. I don’t want to feel like shit anymore. I don’t want to feel alienated. And I don’t want my skin/appearance to keep getting worse. 
My quit date is March 26, which is six months before my 30th birthday. 
Any encouragement you can give would be greatly appreciated. I’d also like to hear any success stories about improved skin/teeth etc. (Vanity, amiright?)
Anyway, thank you!",4

I’ve been a smoker for +7 years and never tried to quit, this is my first time and I never thought that I would be here! Quitting smoking was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. This last (pandemic) year i was smoking at least 1.5 packs a day.

My first month was terrible, i was dealing with insomnia, anxiety and depression and got professional help for mental health (still doing that) but my determination was really really strong because deep inside i knew that i could do this but it was really really hard.

I couldn’t relate to other people who also quit smoking because for them was way easier and couldn’t find someone that was experiencing same thing as me, and that made things harder.

So i started looking for articles about depression and anxiety related to quitting smoking and found some stuff that gave me hope.

After my 1st month things started to feel better. I started getting better sleep, yoga and walking helped me with my anxiety, i also took off time from work.
These stuff helped me a lot with my mental health and brought me courage to continue.

Besides quitting smoking, this tough experience is teaching me to love myself, take care of myself and practice patience.

Some things that I LOVE now:

🤸‍♀️ The feeling that i totally forget about smoking for days 

🌿 That I can breathe way better  

💩 That me and my breath don’t smell like 💩

To anyone who is experiencing similar issues please note that it’s only temporary (also writing this for myself just in case 🤣)

I haven’t really had a problem with giving any of those up, but they were my standard “stress relievers” in the past. I’m also trying to lose weight, so food rewards are a bad idea. When I initially quit, I used walking and yoga as stress relief, but I have a new job that’s exercise intensive and I’m too exhausted for those options to be as viable anymore. I love my job, but my feet and legs hurt too much at the end of the day to walk off or exercise away cravings.

I just want to start by saying that I've been lurking in this sub for quite a while and it is the most consistently positive, uplifting, and encouraging sub I've seen.

I quit last night. I had my quit date planned for a while - discussed in counseling, read the book, planned my strategies, and here I am! Of course first thing this morning the coffee pot breaks and water goes EVERYWHERE. I just had to stand in the kitchen and chuckle to myself, thinking, 'this is going to be a really fun month"" - insert giant fake smile GIF.

I've been really inspired along the way to get to 3/12/21 by everyone here. Those of you who have posted your successes and your triumphs and your setbacks and frustrations and all of it is so helpful for those of us looking in on a process that is very frightening from the outside. I hate that it feels so scary. I hate the lie that it is insurmountable and destined for failure. These insights that you have shared and that I have read have given me the bravery to set my date and stick to my plan. I looked the fear and anxiety in the face, acknowledged it, and gave it the big ol' middle finger. I am so done with how smoking has made me feel. It made me feel like a shell of myself. I used to run marathons and now I am winded from running around the yard with my dog. My anxiety and depression have been so much worse in the past couple of years. I especially have had really bad anxiety about my health and the existential threat of a horrible, cancerous death. I've become withdrawn from friends (COVID didn't help that). I have seen myself constantly thinking about when the next smoke would be. All in all, I hated it. I would stand outside, puffing, and thinking about how much I freaking hated it. It made me feel terrible. It made my heart race and it ruined my guts. It made me so self-conscious of people I respect finding out. The list goes on, and you all know what I'm talking about.

In any case, I just wanted to say thanks to this community. It's honestly been a big part of getting me to this point. I am nervous about the next month, but I have a trip planned with friends to celebrate being a month nicotine free. I plan to enjoy the trip. I wouldn't have gotten to this point without reading your posts and comments (I saved a lot of them for times when I need them). I thought that writing something up on here would help and now I'm at the end of it and it really did lol. It's nice that other people get it. So thanks again and I wish you all the best of luck!",9

My older sister smoked. She called me outside at school to get me to take a puff of a cigarette and I coughed my lungs out. Her and her friends laughed cause it was oh. SO. funny.

I was embarrassed and wanted to PROVE I could smoke too like the ""cool kids"".

Here I am, almost 16 years later. Addicted to cigarettes. I hate it. I quit for a week when I volunteered at a camp as a counselor. The first 3 days sucked so bad but I did it.

And then.... I started smoking again. I don't know why. 

But I want to stop. 

I hate the cravings. I hate smelling like smoke. I hate pissing out money on a habit that gets me nowhere. I hate damaging my lungs, killing my body.

I need to stop. It will be hard. It will be stressful.

I will miss that cigarette that I feel I need when I'm stressed out, the cigarette I think I need going to work. The cigarette I think I need when I'm on my way home from work.

But I will also appreciate the feeling I have when I'm walking and not gasping for breath.

I will appreciate not smelling like smoke and feeling  self conscious when I'm talking to someone. 

I will appreciate all the money I save. Not always having to think of when I can have another smoke or where I can buy some from when I'm desperate. 

When I'm driving, before I light a cigarette I look to see if anyone is watching. Why? Because I feel self conscious about smoking. I know I shouldn't be. I'm embarrassed by it. 

Today is my 31st birthday. I have been a smoker for 15/16 years. I'm tired of it. I love this community. I don't comment much but I appreciate how supportive everyone is.

I need support from you now. 

Anyone have any tips? I have nicotine patches and gum. My plan right now is to ride through the cravings and take my dog for a walk when I want to have a smoke but I can't do that at work.

Any support is appreciated  💜",13

I use both the path and the gum. Sounds extreme I know, but considering I was consuming about 40 mg of nicotine a day, 4 mg gum nor a 21 mg patch wasn't going to cut it. So I mix both. Do I still get cravings? Absolutely. But the difference is that they are very mild. Hopefully after my second box of patches i can move to step two eventually.   


To be honest, I don't think I will ever be able to stop using nicotine gum. But the thing is that I feel much healthier this way. Because of chain vaping/smoking, Going up and down stairs winds me at 24 years old. But hopefully, this will change over time.",3

Suddenly all of those motivations are gone.

My boyfriend of 2 years dumped me over TEXT. He said he didn't want a serious relationship and that when he pictures his future, he doesn't see anyone in it but himself.

Or removing myself from the stress of work with a buddy and getting some fresh air (irony, save your letters) and talking about stuff unrelated to work.

I still do the same thing sans the smoke but it doesnt feel the same. and that sucks... and I do not feel like going outside for a smoke break when not smoking does anything, and it just turns into a discussion about stopping to smoke.
I can't get that same break any other way, coffee perhaps but because of how my work is I can only get away with that once in the mornings.

I for sure thought the physical aspects of quitting would be the worst given how the first few days felt, turns out its the life style

smoking is something i, just, can't!! it's like this best friend for life that lures me to this brief 3 minutes of serenity and solitude. had tried to quit about 11 years ago, wasn't easy, reached out to a physician who prescribed chantix, that wasn't easy either, but it did work. not even a month later, life threw shit at me, and resumed smoking again, because, of course, dang it! every now-and-then there were spikes and lows in life, and similar trends with how many i'd smoke that day. couple of years i managed to cut-down during regular work-hours. brief periods of time when i could go without smoking from 8 AM until 8 PM. however, on average, 5 to 7, max up to 10 a day, varying by situation-to-situation basis. last year had been the worst, through the year, i am now at, 1 every hour, or sometimes more, easily 15 to 16, maybe even more, through all the waking hours. i most definitely want to help myself and get better at life. 

1. i live alone, i have always felt an office environment or being with people helped overcome cravings. lock-down and remote-work definitely haven't helped.

2. it's a mix of all - cravings, boredom, worrisome anxiety, and ritualistic.

3. i don't feel good, red-burning eyes, heaviness in the head, but the motivation to commit to cutting-down hasn't really come in the past 8 weeks. feel like i haven't even tried cutting-down, or phasing-out to begin with.

4. despite my inability to phase-out, i reached out to a physician who prescribed wellbutrin xl. i was supposed to put-in the effort of phasing-out, and the medication would eventually help with the cravings. totally failed at any of that. continued smoking through the last 30 days of the course of the medication.

5. i now think i need distractions and support, but i really don't know where to find them, particularly that i live alone.

6. i want to be able to space-apart, 2 to 3 hours, eventually more, and thus, phase-out and hopefully quit completely. i don't know if that works. i don't even know how to, or if i can space-apart, tried and failed the past 8 weeks, with medication too.

7. i am hopeful good things are going to happen in life, and if I don't overcome this addictive habit, i'll probably just go back to dang it, again!!

irrespective of my failure to even begin phasing-out, and spacing-apart over the past weeks, i plan to continue trying. i still believe spacing-apart, phasing-out are the necessary first steps to quitting completely. i am sensing the beginning of an aversion this morning. i have felt like this previously too, just briefly. i hope i can sustain and nurture this feeling of aversion. i really want to say good bye to this really nasty best buddy!!",10

This is the longest time by far that I've ever had a break from smoking in 20 years. I may have had a break for a week tops a few times before that, but I was usually a very diligent smoker who smoked 30 cigarettes and up per day.

Why I've been able to quit now when I wasn't able to before is for the following reason alone: when I quit this time, I was mentally done with smoking. Done. Not at all interested in having another cigarette again ever. I was tired of constantly clearing my throat and being a slave to this foul-smelling weed that was only a detriment to my health and my wallet. I was having alarming sensations in my chest every so often and I'm only in my mid 30s. This time I knew I was done.

Every attempt before this one I was white-knuckling it. Counting down the hours until it was time to sleep and another day without a cigarette would be done. Every hour without a cigarette was excruciating. I would try to deceive myself by telling myself I didn't want to smoke, when really it was all I wanted to do... but you can't be on fire and convince yourself that you're not feeling hot. You've got to douse the flames (get mentally prepared that you never want to smoke again) before you can properly quit. With this quit I don't even think about it. I know within my heart of hearts that I never want another cigarette. I thought I'd have all these mental triggers that I built up over the years. Drinking coffee, right before going in to a movie theater, after eating a meal, while having a drink etc. All of that just evaporates when you cut the bullshit and REALLY know that you don't want to have another smoke.

Because it really is an absurd addiction. On paper, there's nothing at all to recommend smoking, and a multitude of reasons to never do it... yet we do it anyway. It defies all reason.

Getting in to the appropriate mindset is essential, I believe, for most people to quit smoking for good. Which is why I think Allen Carr's book on quitting smoking is so successful in helping people to quit. Once you have the proper mental shift in thinking about smoking you will know it. You won't be having to reinforce it to yourself by telling yourself that you're done. You'll just be done.

I hope this helps someone. Wishing everyone success with their quit.",120

Because college is shut due to covid I've been completely isolating with my family. That means no outside contact other than food deliveries.



Needless to say, quitting in these conditions was as easy as if someone else was making the choice for me. For the first 50 days it was going well, it felt like my decision. I was exercising regularly, eating well, enjoying the lung and heart benefits! Enjoying feeling like I wasn't killing myself 5+ times a day. 



But for the last month I've been thinking about cigs a lot. College starts back in person in a few days and temptation will be everywhere. I'm not exercising regularly or eating as healthily and the benefits of not smoking just seem less worth it. 



I daydream about smoking. I've pretty much admitted to myself that when I go back to college I'll start smoking again. I don't want to smoke regularly like I did, I know that buying a pouch or straights would lead straight away to my old regular habits. The idea of an occasional cigar has floated around my brain. But then I think about being at college with my friends who smoke. I already know that if they offer I'll take them up. It's just too hard to resist, already. And naturally I'd then want them at home as well,and get antzy if I don't have them. And them I'm at square one. Money wasted. Lungs heavy with tar. Unconcsiounably smoking once again, when I know that I've had this golden opportunity to throw the habit away for good.



Writing this has made me remember why I quit. I'd feel repulsed as I smoked, so strongly that when the thought occurred I'd have to throw my cig away, even if I'd just lit it. It's one thing when you enjoy it, but I wasn't enjoying it, it figuratively felt like a sticky, tarry vice clamped onto my heart and brain, unable to let me be free, let me breathe. Wasting money, god damn so much money. And I'm not exactly rich either, pretty much all my dispensable income goes on cigs and alcohol. 



Maybe I could be really strict with myself. Only smoke in the evening. It wouldn't work. Two in the day, one in the evening? It wouldn't work.
Just once in a while, a few times a week after a long day, with a whiskey in the evening. I wish so badly that I could do that. I wouldn't mind smoking every now and again, once or twice a week for the rest of my life. But it wouldn't be once or twice a week. I fucking love cigarettes, it would be all the time. Every day. And I just can't do that, I can't face that, but I'm sure that's what's coming. I've done so well. What now?



I feel like I've already started again, but I have one key advantage over this retchous condition: I haven't broken my streak of abstinence and smoked yet. And maybe, just maybe, if I can strengthen my resolve before the temptation is presented its opportunity to indulge, I'll be able to resist. 



Please help me to strengthen my resolve, I don't want to smoke, I need some way to fix this and am simply to partial to cigarettes to objectively help myself, so r/stopsmoking help me put it on the table, am I fucked, what are the alternatives, why should I stop, what damage control could I attempt if I can't stop, is it hopeless?

(sorry for the long ass post, got some mixed feelings about cigs man, I love them and I hate them, and with college stress they might provide the relief I need rn ya know? Fuck)",11

When I smoked I was in my happy place, I never smoked more than 10 cigs a day (I had my mind set to 1 pack every 2-3 days, never pack a day) and it was way better than now. 

I decided to go cold overnight, main reason being: Covid. And I got a month in and it was nothing special. I never smoked at home so I was always 2 days in a week cigarette free. But then this crave came to smoke. And I smoked 2 cigarettes and then I didn't smoke for a month again. 

It's been 2 months since that happened and I've noticed all the things around me better (smell, money in my pocket, etc.) BUT the stress (which is the same as before, I do work in a stressful enviorment) is literally killing me. I have high blood pressure (which wasn't the case before, I literally almost died from high hypertension, doctor prescribed nitroglycerin in case I almost get a heart attack again) and I have severe psoriasis patches (which I had when my son was born and never so hard after that) I sleep bad (waking up, which I never did before) and my coordination is fu\*ked up on times (droping things, etc.). 

I'm not sure but I do have a feeling that smoking helped me, even though it sucks. I have craves like shit.

I'm hoping there's someone or a few people that wouldn't mind exchanging numbers and trying to create some sort of accountability/competition to quit.

I'm 20 and chain vaped high nicotine vape juice since I was 17 and I could tell my energy, mood and breathing was starting to weaken and lower so I decided to quit.

I spent 3 days hitting my vape about 5% of the amount I usually do and then just stopped completely and I feel good. My breathing is loosening up, I somehow just magically feel happier and have more energy and the cravings aren't as bad as I thought they'd be although they can still peak?

While my cravings seem minor and controllable as of now it's weird because it's like my brain is trying to trick itself. I still have triggers around like my GF vaping and Dad smoking that may contribute but I catch myself almost like forgetting the whole quit thing and thinking bout how Imma grab my vape and use it and then I like realize completely again I'm quitting. Feels like a funky dissociation with reality.

The worst withdrawal symptom so far is my short temper and anger that just pops up without warning if something brushes me the wrong way. I also feel like I lack every emotion besides anger and happiness. I'm also randomly dripping sweat enough that I've bumped myself up to 2 showers a day. The minor headaches aren't that bad and the insomnia keeps me up for an extra hour at night.

Lots of you seem to think you need to quick smoking by relying purely on willpower alone.

That's dumb, we all want to be able to say ""I quit cold turkey"" but statistics aren't on your side.

Go speak to a doctor, see what your options are. 
I was given meds that blocked the receptors for nicotine in my brain, so I could still smoke but not get the nicotine from it. But that's not all, it also included some mood stabilizers so I didn't want to murder an entire city and anti-withdrawal ingredients to help with the cravings and all the things that make it harder.

Your insurance will surely cover it, because you cost less money to them if you don't smoke. I paid 1 euro for them because of that. 

I personally took those meds, and then after ~2 weeks I just didn't bother lighting another one, but if after 2 weeks you aren't ready you can keep going. Its not 0 to 100 in one day either as the amount of receptor blockers in the pills gradually increase daily. You don't _feel_ that you're not smoking.",3

When I first started smoking, I smoked because I enjoyed it, but now I smoke it because I cannot live without it.

Cigarette is like a toxic relationship to me. I hate that it takes my health away, but I still want it. It hurts me, it slows me down, it literally ruins my life, but I still want to put that cigarette between my lips and light it up. I smoke it like there is no tomorrow. I like the way it makes me feel. I like to share my happiness and saddness with it by smoking it. I don't know if it make sense to you, but this is how I feel about it.

It made my personality. It changed me. When I go outside, I always make sure that I have my cigarettes with me. If I don't have any, I directly go get cigarettes before going anywhere else. I cannot sleep before I smoke my last cigarette. I cannot be fully awake before I smoke my first cigarette.

I have tried to quit many times. It makes me feel like I am missing something. I feel like I am in a nightmare. People who don't like the smell of cigarette do not avoid me anymore because I avoid them before they do. When I am at a party, I go outside for smoking. I don't feel like I am missing anything inside because to me, the cigarette break is the party.

I love inhaling the smoke, and Iove watching it leaving my body from my mouth. I love the shape of smoke. Man... This is who I am. A lone wolf with a pack of cigarette.

I cannot do this anymore though. I am very young, and I feel very old. My body doesn't work properly anymore and I am so sure that it is related to smoking. But how can I quit when I am physically and emotionally connected to it. I feel like smoking made this character in me. One side of me wants to have a new and a healthy life, and other side of me want to smoke like there is no tomorrow. And that second side make sense a lot. Why would I quit? Being healthy is not convincing. Dying later or dying because of another reason is not convincing. I do not see a purpose for quitting.

Honestly, I don't even know what to do after this point.

After waking up, after showering, after every meal (even snacks), whenever someone else lit up a cigarette etc. whenever I had the chance; I would light one up. I have Gastritis and GERD, I’m at the point where I’m short of breathing and have to cough up loads of phlegm, even with a little bit of blood sometimes every morning. Even though I’m 19, my libido and potency have decreased A LOT the past months. I met a guy some months ago, he has cancer and used to smoke 3 packs a day, so cigs are probably the cause. I see him suffer from pain and take morphine everyday, while I’m sitting next to him, not being able to help, and wanting to smoke a cigarette because I’m too addicted. This is going to be hell for me I assume, as I smoke every time I get the chance to. The negative effects that I’m seeing, are just too much, and I can’t take this anymore.

As I’m texting this, the thought of quitting just gives me a huge craving feeling. 

Wish me luck and patience please.

I started smoking around 18 & at 28 have decided to try quitting. I’m 12 days in and feeling pretty discouraged. 

I guess I was under the impression that the really intense panic-ensuing cravings would have let up at least a little by now, but I still feel like I’m on day 3. 

I feel ridiculous saying this, but I’m genuinely sad everyday because I miss this habit I enjoyed and i miss not suffering through everyday just to wake up and dread getting through another day. 

Still having the dramatic af thoughts all day i.e. “Quitting won’t keep me from dying, it just adds time to my natural life but I could still die in a car wreck tomorrow” or “I’m wasting days of my life in misery when I could be smoking and enjoying them” (that one pisses me off the most bc of how illogical it is)
“Oh, you’re proud of me? That’s cool but I don’t fu$&ing care, I still just want a cigarette”.

Idk. That’s pretty much it, I guess I don’t have much else to say. Just seriously losing sight of why I’m doing this. Or more so not caring anymore about all the logical reasons. If sound logic aka the strongest arguments for quitting aren’t working, will anything? Why haven’t I had an easier day yet?

Also I’m sorry to be such a drag (hah..a pun. But I don’t care bc I just want a cigarette...). I truly hope to feel as motivated and empowered as many here seem to be.

As I was reading I was like yeah yeah we all know this and we all know that, sure, sure. All correct and relevant but nothing new. 

But then I got to these (now obvious) parts which were a game changer for me:

the battle to resist cravings or a cigarette is eventually exhausting and not sustainable. I quit because I don’t want to smoke so why am I battling myself? Yes there will be cravings but smoking will only trap me back in a cycle that I don’t want to be part of. The I don’t want to smoke mentality is a really good way to look at it (at least for me)

his other observations that we don’t really want to smoke but it’s just a by product of abstinence since the last smoke and association with routines we’ve enslaved ourselves to was also helpful.

The amount of nicotine tolerance I developed using these products is so high, my withdrawals are extremely bad. The nicotine delivery on these pouches was quite frankly insane. I would not recommend switching to these products as I am more dependent than ever. Just go cold turkey, it’s the best and only way to go my friends.

Every day is a real struggle, I feel I can’t function since I quit snus 11 days ago...

Each quit seems to be easier. This 2nd cold turkey quit after relapsing a few years ago was a breeze compared to my first cold turkey quit. So guys keep trying never give up. As many have stated it takes a few quits before it sticks.

My teeth are already whiter I swear. I didn't feel like it was like this my last quit. Maybe it's a mind trick but I am sure of it.

My smell has come back stronger and quicker this quit. When I was working on my car the other day I could even smell the cig sweat. It was crazy. Wash your clothes especially your sheets.

If you guys are going cold turkey I slept a lot the first few days. It's much easier to resist the cravings if you sleep through the worst parts/ beginning stages of a quit. Try taking off work on a Friday or Monday and quitting on a weekend if possible.

My last cold turkey quit lasted 6 months. This time I will not let my addict brain win ever again. 6 months of freedom. One slip up and I was addicted again for 3 years until 15 days ago. Once you quit don't ever ever take another puff or your 🧠 will want to revert to it's old pathways of addiction. Wow nicotine is a horrible drug.

I immediately jumped into intermittent fasting. I haven't been working out lately (about to change that) and I was scared of massive weight gain. So I immediately jumped into 16/8 fasting to help mitigate any gain. 

My mornings have been so rough. My morning ritual was to go smoke a cig and chug a coffee. It's a fight to get out of bed in the AM. Some of it my guess is withdrawal depression some of it probably sleep apnea and less stimulants to overcome my lack of sleep. - my goals are lose some weight to help with the apnea. As far as the depression it's a mind game. I remind myself life is already better without the cigs and as I get further in my quit it will get better and better.

I have an interview in 2 days. As I was trying on suits from the closet I found a pack of cigs in the pocket of one of my suits. Probably a year old. I initially smelled them (no smell since probably too stale). I set them on a desk while I kept trying suits on. Then I had the thought of well just one won't hurt. I immediately flipped out on myself and was like hell no that's the addict in me talking and threw the cigs in the trash. It only takes once craving, one emotional cig, one moment and you throw out all the time spent coming off the drug. I almost slipped thank God I didn't.

Guys were free. It's not worth the puff. Don't romanticize it. It's a drug that once your free of you can never ever give into it again. I learned this lesson the hard way and it cost me another 3 years of addiction and another 9 grand in cigs over that time. 

Stay strong guys and gals. I am proud of each and everyone of us. It's not easy to quit but cigs do nothing but kill us faster, cost us money, and make us weaker mentally and physically.",6

I couldnt handle cold turkey. The psychological aspects I'm doing much better with, but the physical withdrawals were too much. I expected to be really miserable for a few days (like the time I quit for a month before), but after the constant headaches, irritability, and being unable to function for over a week and no end in sight made it impossible. 

I went and got patches today (2 weeks worth of 21mg and 2 weeks worth of 14mg). Im starting those when I wake up. I just read the back of the box, and they suggest 6 weeks on each level. I was smoking about a pack a day (for about 12 years). If I reduce to 14mg in two weeks, is that trying to go too fast? Does anyone have any experience using patches and reducing from step 1 (21mg) to step 2 (14mg) faster than recommended? Im really trying to do this right. I can handle some withdrawals, but i dont think i can handle that level of withdrawals again, going from normal nicotine to nothing.

My plan was to finish the 2 weeks of 21mg then go to 14mg and go from there. It sucks i screwed up, but Im just trying to revise my game plan. I realized this is a marathon, not a sprint. If i need to reduce my nicotine over time, id rather do that and be successful than fail again.",4

Only quit once before (and it wasn’t on purpose, I was literally too depressed to get out of bed to go buy smokes) so I’m feeling pretty good about this.
The other day my coworker, who smokes, came into work. She knows I’m trying to quit smoking and we talk about it quite a bit. Here’s how the convo goes

Coworker: hey wanna come outside for a smoke before I start?

Me: .... no.. I’m trying to quit...

Coworker: *obviously frustrated* well you’re not supposed to quit cold turkey you know 

Me: well it’s working for me

Coworker: your body can go into serious withdrawal, you probably shouldn’t do that, just come smoke with me

Inevitably, someone who had quit years ago would say something along the lines of, "" I still want one every day"" or "" I still get cravings.""

Hearing this would crush me every single time. I would say to myself, ""What is the point of quitting if you still get cravings all the time? Cravings five years later? That sounds horrible!"" and I would lose motivation every time.

I'm here today in the hopes of clearing up this misconception for anyone having the same thoughts. The thing I didn't understand at the time is that the cravings these people were talking about are NOT the same as the cravings you are experiencing while smoking or very recently/currently quitting.

The cravings you get while still being a smoker, or in the first couple weeks after quitting are STRONG AF! After quitting for a bit, yes, you may indeed still get 'cravings', but these are NOTHING compared to the strong urges you get in the beginning. They are barely a vague shadow of a memory of smoking.

I quit about 4 years ago, and from time to time I think "" Gee, a cigarette would be nice right now"", but it isn't like I feel like I need to run out to the gas station immediately, like when I was quitting. It is just a curious, fleeting thought that is gone as fast as it came, and I move on with my life before I even know it. This is what ex-smokers are talking about.

**TLDR**: Please don't get discouraged when ex-smokers say they still 'get cravings'. Those 'cravings' are laughable compared to the ones you currently know, and should in no way prevent you from quitting. Godspeed, you beautiful quitter.",147

Everytime i dont feel 100% fit i always assume the worst. Today i spat out some red stuff and i thought omg my lungs are bleeding. I was going nuts until i realized i just ate a lot of watermelon and those where parts of it.
I just feel so unstable since i stopped smoking and i never ever worried about my health with such anxiety in my whole life before.

I am looking for some people to help me write my next blog article. Its going to be about peoples experience of smoking and how they overcame their demons. A lot of advice is not really good for quitting, I find that there needs to be real life experiences wrote about.

I think also the stigma with smoking and professionals, sports people who smoke but are ashamed to admit they need help and smoke secret etc is a topic i want to cover.  


For example, my friend shared this with me (OK to share):

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
Its been an off and on battle for years. This time, after relapsing i am 11 days into quitting. I am embarrassed and ashamed I smoke. I am a secret smoker, or was, till now and I am determined not to smoke anymore.

I smoke as an emotional crutch. It numbs pain. However, I started getting migraines triggered by smoking and it was making me ill. I haven't smoked for 11 days now.  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  


&#x200B;

I think this would make for better reading to help people overcome their addictions, from real life people.

Would you like to contribute? Even a post on here would help construct something a bit outside the box.

If you have a blog and would like to link swap, I'd be happy to do that also.

I think between us, we could do something awesome that would help ourselves and others on their journeys to quitting.

After lurking around and regularly reading the different stories and comments here to stay motivated I decided to share my non-smoker journey, too.

I started smoking when I was 18, cause I aspired to be cool like David Bowie, haha. But deep insidd mainly because I felt very lonely and bad about myself at that time....and something in smoking seemed like a fitting add-on to my overall beaten-down self.

Well I started to become a heavy smoker quite fast, smoking 20-30 cigarettes a day and at 25 I've already had to deal with chest pains and feeling overall shitty in my body, having no energy and sometimes wanting to vomit after smoking but STILL continuing to light up. I can't imagine how miserable that must have looked from the outside. 

At one point smoking just turned into an escape from myself, from being alone with myself, from people being able to see me only me, without a cigarette in front of my face - it felt like a guard. 

But hey, I'm quitting for probably around the 200th time already, but this time I'm very serious. I've prepared a good motivation, I talk with a therapist about it, I have smoking friends but even thoigh they still smoke, they support me in quitting.

So! This time I will finally be free! And if the hard times come I will get through it! And if I slip, I'll just get back up again. No excuses this time :)

Good luck to everyone else here being strong and doing something really good for themselves and their body and mind!",9

Hours and mullllllttttiple drinks later I realize I had them the whole time in my pocket. I gave them to my BIL who left them sitting around.

A year of working from home, mostly lounging on the couch and smoking a vape. I signed up for a gym with my friend and went to my first cycling class this morning. I didn't make it 10 minutes into the class before my lungs felt on fire. I couldn't breathe and felt light-headed. I tried to slow down and catch my breath but had to step out and cough for 15 minutes before I even felt like I could drive myself home. I have always been an active person. Backpacking, yoga, jogging (more like walking for the past year). I know I haven't been in the best shape lately, but my god, I thought I was gonna die. 

I have been smoking for about 11 years, was able to switch over to vaping 3 years ago, thinking that was a huge feat. I think I've just been smoking a lot more cause I can smoke inside my house anytime. After a little over 3 hours without nicotine I can tell the withdrawal is going to be hell. My lungs are still burning from this morning and I just can't justify this addiction anymore. Posting here for some sort of accountability to myself. I've ""quit"" numerous times before, one time for almost a year. I need this time to be the last. Here's to becoming a quitter!",3

I was on a 15 hour drive and vaped and dipped so much I felt sick when we finally arrived that night, even though I felt sick I smoked before bed. The next morning I decided to quit for good knowing that It would be hard since 6 of my college friends were there and they would be smoking nonestop the whole vacation. I managed to get through the whole trip without smoking even when I got intense cravings and had multiple people smoking around me. I managed to not smoke for 15 hours on the car ride home while people were smoking next to me the whole time. And I managed not to smoke the night I got back in town and went out drinking with my hometown friends even when I felt the strongest cravings that I had felt the past 10 days. 

the way I did it was by diverting my attention whenever I noticed a craving come on. I would also tell myself that I know I am making the right decision to quit, And remembering that I decided I would never consume nicotine for the rest of my life, And never doubting myself. 

I'm not letting my guard down. I have tried to quit many times but this time has already proven to be different. Thank you for your support and letting me share.",12

My smoking story began pretty much the same as anyone's, when I was a teenager and continued to smoke at varying rates throughout my twenties. Never quite exceeded a pack every two days but also would chain smoke in certain situations. That being said I am turning 30 in 14 days and am determined to leave smoking in my past and start off a new decade with a breath of fresh air. 

After many months of being on the verge of quitting, yet–feeling too emotionally dependent on tobacco to stop, and  with the end of the pandemic in-sight; I came to the realization that this is the perfect time to quit smoking. In the past I always excused myself with my high pressure schedule that I should wait until a time when I wasn't going to disrupt myself so much as a time to quit. 

If you are new here and mostly homebound still think about this: social distancing is a great opportunity to change your habits with more privacy. It still sucks big time, but at least you aren't running around with a chicken with it's head cut off, over-committed, and having a nicotine fit. Another auspicious factor is there are not a lot of parties and socializing at the moment, boom, highly tempting situations canceled until further notice. Also, if you live in the northern hemisphere–winter sucks.

Over the last year or so, well since covid hit the UK my smoking has gone through the roof. 

This time last year, I smoked maybe 5 per day. Only ever at work Mon-Fri 9-5. I never use to take my tobacco home and never smoked at the weekend. But being forced to work at home blurred that boundary. It didn't take long until I was smoking in the evenings and weekends. 

My wife has never smoked so doesn't understand and although she has been tollerent I always feel judgement. And why should she accept my selfish, self destructive habit.

I'm fed up of stinking of smoke and having yellow fingers, it's disgusting! Every time I smoke I hate myself a little bit more. 

I've done no planning or research, but I'll keep putting it off for ever if I don't just do it.

The nonstop puffing caused me chronic coughing. I was really beginning to get worried. Every attempt to quit always resulted in an anxious trip to the smoke shop. 

Here's what I did.

1. Even BEFORE you have the urge to have a smoke, take a VERY SLOW VERY LONG VERY DEEP breathe in until your stomach/chest is capped with air - simulating the shape of your mouth that you would normally take an actual puff. Hold the breathe for a second, and exhale as if you were blowing out smoke. Mimic AS MUCH of the vape / cig smoking routine as possible.
2. Do this SEVERAL times - almost to the point of getting a little bit light headed or feel a bit of an oxygen rush. I live in NY and found that the cold air helps a bit for me from a stimulation\* and simulation\* standpoint because of the refreshing feel of the cold(menthol) and seeing my exhalation.
3. I know this sounds corny to some, but I recently got into meditation. Nothin crazy - just a simple playlist or track on Spotify. I take a cold shower once per day and listen to a 10-12 minute meditation track. The shock of the cold shower + the euphoria of completing the cold shower + the soothing nature of the meditation resembles the ups and downs of pre-during-post smoke. 
4. ON Nicotine pouches. I found this to help break the ice of not smoking. I felt it was the best choice since there is no tobacco --- pure Nic. Since I was having SUCH a difficult time going even a couple hours without a puff - I knew I  had to meet the urge somewhere halfway. This was my choice. The goal is to quit smoking AND nicotine dependency. I chose to divide and conquer. SO MUCH respect for any cold turkeys out there.  

Summary / Most affective approach for me:

1. Get some ON Nic pouches > take frequent SLOW LONG DEEP breathes to mimic the smoking physical sensation > control your stress / anxiety with something nice and relaxing. 

I have now gone 3 days without the ON Nicotine pouches. I have gone well over a month without smoking.

NOTE: Take the breathing exercise seriously! VERY SLOW (make a tiny little hole by puckering your lips the size of a cig) VERY LONG and VERY DEEP breathing. If you only try one thing from this suggestion - try the breathing!!

Good luck everyone. Much love and support.",6

As of this writing I have more or less smoked a 20 pack a day for 8 or so years. Times a little foggy. At a few points 2 packs, and at worst 3 packs. But those were random days/weekends. Pack and a half for the last year or so has been peak regular amounts for me.

A few years back I randomly quit for a month as I had no money to buy them. During that time I didn't notice any difference. About a month back I started these pills that have reduced my smoking to 3 a day. Some times 5 or 6, but 3 is my average now. Morning coffee and a smoke, or after supper appears to be the routine I'm having hardest to break. I have yet to notice any difference in my breathing, taste or smell. Everything still feels the same to me. I plan to try to stop completely during this month when it feels right. So I'm more just curious to hear others experiences and what to look for. The only difference I have noticed, is the first few puffs kind of taste bad to me. Not awful though. And once I get through them it's back to normal.",5

I started smoking back in 2016 due to some legal issues and me having to stop smoking marijuana, I picked it up and have had small time period where I quit but would get an urge and go right back into it. I started smoking weed again while still smoking black and molds but I had completely stopped back in may 2020, due to my ex taking one out of my hand and tossing it into a water bottle. I was good for about 5 months then suddenly on day went to the convenience store  and picked it back up and haven’t stopped since. My new gf wants me to stop, parents have told me to quit, as well as friends, but I can’t seem to get away from the urge.

I’ve been reading “the easy way to stop smoking” by Allen Carr and while it had been a major help on learning why and how we start smoking, i still want to stop sooner than I finish the book, even tho the books instructions are to keep smoking until you finish.

I took a five day trip out of town recently, and was a bit irritated but I managed. I felt great that I wasn’t smoking. But as soon as I got home, I lit one back up. I feel it’s ruining my life and don’t want it to be a future problem. 

Anybody else have such a hard time quitting? Any tips that could help? I don’t want to indulge nicotine substitutes because I feel at any point you can get right back to smoking at any given point. Any and all comments are appreciated.",2

Every day, they're less intense, they're my reminder to not smoke ever again if I dont want to experience this again 😭.

I was always on the lighter-moderate side I'd say about 6 cigarettes a day. But during the last year, due to the pandemic, it became more like 13 so that's why I decided it's time to give it up for good!! Full disclosure I use nicotine gum still!

Due to me not being a heavy smoker- I really didn't think my taste was too affected. I thought that's just for chain smokers. Boy oh boy was I wrong!!! I can literally TASTE food suddenly, its so weird like I was missing an entire sense!?!? All my ""favorite"" foods taste different. I drink my coffee WAY too sweet, the sandwich I always get from my local shop is VERRRRRYYYYY salty (knew it was high in sodium but never tasted it before 😂), etc.

Also I think I really got lucky in that I seem to be LOSING weight!! How? Well it's odd but before because I barely tasted my food, I would eat double the portion to feel ""satisfied"". Now I'm eating much smaller portions, almost ridiculous considering the amount I used to eat, but I am savoring every bite and taking my time to eat it. Another huge bonus, I am actually able to enjoy healthy food. I remember as a smoker (acting like it was years ago but yeah lol), I found it so ridiculous how people would say they eat fruit for ""dessert""- like HOW!?!?!? Well, today as I was having my usual sweets craving after lunch, I ate some strawberries and they really hit the spot.

This whole experience has been very interesting. TBH I really thought it was going to be a lot worse than it turned out to be, maybe because I am still getting nicotine as I chew the gum about 3-4 times a day whenever I really crave a cig. I did have some severe depressive thinking pop up which I never had before for maybe the first 4 days but nothing unbearable, I just thought it was due to lack of sunshine. Oh and don't get me started on the fatigue-I think today is the first day I am able to stay awake for longer than 10 hours straight. Also getting some lovely pimples on my cheek which is apparently a sign of detox. Seems I'm having all the opposite withdrawal symptoms than most people: decreased appetite, lack of energy, skin breaking out rather than clear. But I will never go back even if someone paid me!

Anyways thanks for reading and if I can do this, anybody can! Good luck all!",27

The lozenge provides much better and faster relief but has tons of chemicals that I don’t want to be consuming 10-20 times a day 

The patch doesn’t provide as much relief but certainly helps a bit. The benefit is it doesn’t have nasty chemicals that are going into my mouth and body. I looked at the inactive ingredients and there are only 2 which seem pretty benign after googling. Whereas the lozenge has a brick of ingredients and many are bad like artificial sweeteners and dyes and even sugar (maltodextrin)

In the past he was able to quit smoking when we were living together, but when he moved back with his family it was a constant trigger to make him start smoking. He wants to stop smoking because his passion (he's an athlete) is negatively affected by smoking (plus side: I also physically can't stand smoking because of a lung issue). I believe that without the trigger, he'll be able to stop smoking.

I'm just concerned that the change will cause withdrawal symptoms that I've read about. I'd like to ask for advice about how to subtly help him, since I think it affects his pride if I would say ""Do x, it'll help with your withdrawal symptoms"". I'd rather it just be a natural environment for him to ease into not smoking anymore. 

Thanks in advance :)",1

It seems to have calmed down a bit but it’s something that comes on maybe once in the middle of the day and once while I’m sleeping at night (I use a sleep study app that records noises at night). My stop smoking app said this was normal but I’m wondering how long this will persist. I was smoke a pack and a half a day before I quit and didn’t wean off of them. Using the patches now and the quit has gone great so far.,6

It was in my first year of Uni, and only in social settings, with friends, at parties, etc. I told myself I had it under control and I wouldn't really get cravings, but I enjoyed the social aspect.

Then I got a job as a dishwasher and everyone took smoke breaks, so I bought a vape because I knew I'd start smoking every shift if I didn't. It started off being just 3nic, then 6, then 12 and so on... by the end of my vaping habit I was doing 60nic and vaping non stop through out the day. I wasn't even getting that sweet, sweet, head rush anymore,  it was more like an adult pacifier by that point.

Thing is, if I'd have a cigarette I would still get a small head rush, so I ended up quitting vaping and taking up smoking in pursuit of that feeling. Of course about a week into my smoking habit I wasn't getting head rushes from the cigarettes anymore but I didn't care, I was well addicted at that point. This was a little over a year ago.

Well, just now I've had my last cigarette, I've cut back the past week by using nicotine gum to ease cravings, but plan to quit that in a months time. The problem is I really enjoy the actual feeling of smoking, whether it's tobacco or weed. With the gum however I don't get that same satisfaction as inhaling smoke.

My mom used to be a smoker and has said that taking a deep breath of fresh air can satisfy that feeling, it kind of works but does anyone have any other tips as to how to cope?",14

 I smoked for 10 years before quitting. It seemed impossible to quit at the time because I was going through a lot of hardships, and smoking was the only 'solution' I knew.  

But, I read the posts and comments here, learned what exactly is nicotine craving, and quit cold turkey.  I replaced smoking with exercising. I have been lifting weights and doing lots of cardio since then. These last three years have been the best and healthiest years in my life.

After a long time I played basketball with friends last weekend. After about 10 minutes I had extreme shortness of breath. I lay on the floor for half an hour and felt a sharp scratching in my throat. I had to vomit several times. This has never happened to me before.

At that point I realized how terrible smoking is for me and quit immediately. I never want to experience something like that again and I want to live my life without any health restrictions. This event will stay in my mind for a long time.

The next day I went to the doctor. He found out that I had an asthma attack and that smoking had made it worse. I had never had to deal with asthma until that point.There I was again aware of how harmful smoking is and that I do not want to live like this. What exactly triggered the attack, I could not determine at that time.

I am very early in my quitting journey, not even a full 3 weeks yet. I am so proud, and get pleasantly surprised that i already don't even think about it during my most triggering activities when I used to ""have to"" smoke..like say after coming home from the supermarket, or after cleaning around, after crying, etc. However, this is not my first try: I quit ""successfully"" for quite a few months around 1.5 years ago, after 7 years of smoking hand rolled cigarettes (about 35g a week). I was doing it for me, but what opened my eyes was being told how silly smoking is by this guy who I fell deeply in love with. I wasn't even in love with him when he told me that. Of course many other people told me the same before, and I knew smoking wasn't good..but i hadn't really ""felt"" it affecting me in any way physically and I enjoyed it so much. I don't know why but hearing that one man say it gave me the push. Then we broke up, and after a few weeks I started again. It took me almost a year to get back on track, but here I am and I've never been more disgusted by smokes and tobacco :) 

Sorry about the long intro....now let's get to the actual question. Basically I have a best friend (30f, Sarah), and a friend/boyfriend (30m, Jim.im not serious with him, and his lifestyle is the reasons for it). The two are big smokers. Jim smokes weed with tobacco, his cancer sticks are probably his biggest expense (after rent I guess). Sarah does just tobacco, and sure not crazy amounts...let's say around 50g a week (a pack is 30grams, so one every 4 days? Approximately), she wants to quit and has been talking about it since I met her 2.5 years ago. She never quit for more than 24 hours. Clearly she doesn't ""really"" want it, the benefits outweigh the cons, and they will until shit hits the fan (I've been through the same thought process many times). I asked her if it would make any difference it she were with someone who doesn't smoke, and she said no and she thinks an hypotectical partner should accept smoking. For me smoking is not a personality trait, it's a CHOICE (and not a good one like say fitness or eating healthily), and it shouldn't be accepted, in fact I was so glad that my ex didn't want to be with a smoker (I already had quit when we got together)...I think it's good to have requirements in relationships, saves heartache for both. Anyways, when it comes to friends I don't judge if someone is a smoker like I was just about 3 weeks ago. But I wish I could help my friend Sarah:( she did ask for help but she didn't even try to quit. I don't want to see her die in 25 years from smoking...is there anything I can say or do that would have any impact?? I think people in general don't like to give advice to smokers, but in my experience sometimes it sticks...

Now let's get to Jim...I've already written too much so I'll keep it short...with him I feel like I should cut contact due to his lifestyle (always broke always wasting money on weed and tobacco and alcohol...complaining about work money small expenses etc etc), because otherwise I'll end up compromising what I shouldn't (my happiness). I have mentioned the idea of quitting before to him (I mean before I actually quit myself), asked if he'd do it with me...and he's not even considering it...I feel sad but with him I feel like it's a lost cause (there's other things that make it obvious he's not a match for me, but I wish we could be friends), and I have had enough of being around him. His drug fix always came before me, and it's sad that he thinks smoking helps him in any way. I wonder if there's anything I could even say to him, but I doubt he'd listen. 


Bottom line...I quit smoking (the first time) because something someone said made me realise how selfish I was (smoking and expecting someone to be by my side...to most likely go through an early death), is there any way to make loved ones snap out of it?",2

It got so annoying I was afraid one day I would say or do something stupid. Finally 2 weeks ago he asked me for a cigarrete and I pushed the entire pack on his chest and said ""it's all yours pal"". I was so pissed off I quit. Withdraw really got me though and I had everything from flu, headaches, nightmares, you name it. But everytime I think about smoking a cig I remember having to go down stairs and dealing with my neighboor again. In retrospect I think he did me a favor.",131

First and foremost, thank you all for the stories a support over the past year, and even on my previous quits before this one. Checking this sub makes me feel like I'm not alone and that I have some accountability to a team of people which works perfect with how my brain operates.

As far as the milestone of 1 year, I'm ecstatic that I'm here. I no longer have to worry about where I'm going to get my next smoke or trying to hide my smoke stench and breath (although we're still in COVID so not breathing on people isn't much of a challenge).

Health-wise i can run like crazy and there is no longer the burning pain in my lungs, nor a constant back-and-forth between phlemy and dry coughs.

Finally, and hopefully the most important for most of you, is that I really don't miss smoking! I was a HEAVY smoker to the point where my friends were constantly waiting on me (total dick move). Now i'm content with chilling outside with them while they smoke or going inside while they do if it's too cold. Past about 3 months it was basically easy-mode. if anyone is struggling to reach that 3 month milestone i IMPLORE you to just make it that far. For me the toughest part was always the first 3 days. I would go insane. I tried so many times to quit. I'd been like 9 months before and was high one time and wanted a cigarette - whoops FF two years later and another countless number of failed quits and that's the start of my journey. It's not even a challenge other than knowing that i just shouldn't have even a puff. Had my chance, failed miserably, and now i don't smoke.

Well wishes all, and for those that are just starting and struggling to get past 3 days /3 weeks / 3 months... You can do it! I promise you the intense urges go away and eventually you'll forget about it.",6

Then, I got confident and started smoking casually when I was out with friends. I started smoking a couple of cigs every few days. Slowly but surely I was hooked on this sick addiction again and bought my own pack every day.

During these 3 months that I've started smoking again, I noticed something... In these recent months I have never felt truly happy. 


I lost things like waking up full of energy, enjoying a walk in the park, watching sunsets, dancing & singing out loud while showering or doing the dishes. I lost the excitement to see my girlfriend & friends, to study, to work in my career. Everything felt grim and dull. I got super lazy, sad and even my anxiety came back. The only thing that was bringing me happiness was cigarettes. 

I never realized how much happiness smoking takes away from life. This is why I decided to quit again. I don't want to be a drug addict and have my life controlled by a chemical substance. Fuck smoking and fuck nicotine.",254

The first time went pretty well, I made it 2 weeks without smoking. I won't get into what caused me to start smoking again but I'm feeling fairly confident about this second attempt.
My main issue with the patch was that because I was getting it through a prescription it's a generic brand and it was a constant struggle to get it to stay on for a full day. Usually I'd have to use medical tape on it about halfway through the day. It would come off in the night frequently which would cause me to feel pretty terrible when I woke up.
So my question is what brands would people reccomend that stick better? I've read that the adhesion is a common problem with the generic brands and I'd be willing to pay out of pocket if that's true.",3

It gave me more opportunity to smoke and less reason to quit. I didn't have to go outside to smoke any longer. I didn't reek of ash tray any more. I could get away with a puff or two in the bathroom at work and people would be none the wiser. But I also didn't realize how much I was smoking. There was no real conversion of puffs to cigarettes. I'm fairly certain I ended up smoking more than the pack a day I used to smoke. In the last 20 years the longest I've gone without smoking is 26 hours. That was my first attempt to quit over a month ago. Each successive attempt it's gotten harder and harder. And I know I have to quit because I feel like I'm dying whenever I smoke. My doc diagnosed me with asthma. I can't breathe. My chest hurts. And for some fucked up reason I still want to smoke despite knowing exactly what it will do to me. 

So along with an inhaler my doc prescribed chantix. (A $700 bill. Thank you US health care system.) I haven't started it yet. I'm scared to because of my predisposition to depression. I hear the dreams are wild though. Anyone chime in with if it's worth it?

I dunno. I'm ranting. It's been 17 hours and I have no idea what to do with myself. I've been stuck at home for the last 11 months with no end in sight. Spring has not sprung yet.

Please help","I have been addicted to smoking and nicotine for the past 10 years. I started smoking in college and I haven't ever been able to stop until recently. 

When the pandemic started, I recognised that this would be the best chance I get to stop smoking. So I made the gradual step towards substituting my cigarettes with nicotine gum. As of June, 2020, I haven't touched a single cigarette. 

Its been 259 days now and I no longer crave cigarettes, in fact I stopped craving them in October last year. I no longer feel the need to hold one of them in my hand all the time or the need to exhale that smoke. 

However, my method to reduce my dependence was through nicotine gum. I have tried many many times in the past to stop smoking cold turkey and I've always failed. I've tried vapes but they always led me back to smoking. I've never tried patches because of they were financially not viable in my country. Gum is the version of nicotine that gave me good results. 

So I started with 4 mg gums and then to a mix of 4mg and 2mg, and now this is where I'm stuck. If I don't chew the gums, I start craving them, the same way I used to crave cigarettes. 

Have any of you been able to transition from gums to nothing? Please let me know if you have and how you did it? As for me, I think the next step for me is to be completely on 2mg and ditching 4mg completely but I don't know if I'll be able to completely stop, ever.",5

Apart from day 1, it has been a surprisingly pleasant experience. I have had both insomnia and fatigue, bleeding gums, and aching joints, but it has been bearable, borderline pleasant, because I've reminded myself that healing can be painful, and this is my body's response to detoxing itself from all the chemicals I've sucked into my system on a daily basis since 1999. The last few days however, have been an absolute nightmare. I am not missing cigarettes, nor am I contemplating relapse, or starting it up again, I am just so angry at absolutely everything. Even if I work out or go for a jog, there is perhaps a 30 minute respite until I am back to steaming anger, screaming at inanimate objects, spitting on them, and hitting myself in the face. Every thought I have is bleak, and anything that happens throughout the day is interpreted as a personal insult from the universe towards me.

I have for the past several weeks noticed that I am having an increasingly difficult time to consentrate on just about anything for anything more than 10 minutes. I try to read books, but I give them up just as soon as I have opened them. I loathe everybody I see on youtube, I loathe my friends, and I loathe myself, at the moment. This is perhaps a rant, and I know this will pass with time, but god damn does this constant amped up anger suck.

I shouldn't say it is absolute anger actually, even that is the most noticable, because it is mixed with anxiety & sadness. Since quitting I have started to actually remember my dreams, for instance, for the first time since I can remember, and they have all been unpleasant, with me as the butt of some cruel joke every time. Last night my subconscious mind executed me point blank. Have anyone else experienced stuff like this?

All the best!

So now, when I feel like having a cigarette I repeat to myself: ""I’m not a smoker, I’m a runner” and it actually helps to think about myself in a different way (and along with that choose other healthy habits). For non-runners, I’m sure it can be replaced with other things that define you a bit: Mom, educator or whatever it is that makes you proud about yourself.

Not sure if it works for everyobe but hope it will help some of you.",28
