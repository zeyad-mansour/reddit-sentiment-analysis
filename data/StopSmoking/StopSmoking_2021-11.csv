Quit cold turkey at the first sign of shortness of breath, So yea the shortness of breath never really happened again since i tossed the last butt about 59 days ago. I am guessing because i didnt mark the day on my calender and for the first few days of no smokin i was so out of it that i had no idea what day, Month or year it was. I t was hell of the highest levels or lowest level whichever is worse.. This thanksgiving i could taste stuff and smell aromas for my first non smoking thanksgivin in my adult life. My kin actually complimented me on puttin on some weight on my face and i dont look like a dryin up raisan anymore. I can walk easier and breathe easier. Though i am coughin up some slimmy mucus at regulr timely intervals like once every 4 hours or so. It does not bother me. I still get a bit of dizziness every now and then some weird shootin pains here and there that pass quickly. I am finally starting to sleep thru the night and the tarnation of constipation is almost a thing of the past. Generally i am feeling so much better..Cravings still come and hang around every day once or twice..They are getting less.

For some context i smoked for 7 years, one pack a day.

So my decision wasn't premeditated it was on a whim after i thought the cig i was smoking that day (after a weekend of partying and drinking) tasted really bad.

After that it became a personal challenge for me and i already told all my friends and family that i stopped for good to give me more incentive. The cravings came fast and while i was living them it felt as though stopping didn't make any sense and i had to get my fix. But i quickly noticed that the feeling went away on it's own and i was beck to being normal after half an hour tops. The second week was the worst for me, cravings came hard like 4 times a day but learned to live with them and not to fight them knowing well the feeling won't last forever. I had some nights of insomnia but melatonin helped a lot. It helped having supportive friends (who smoked nonetheless) who reminded my of what a great feat i was doing every time i felt weak. Now what really bothered me was that 2 weeks in i couldn't enjoy alcohol anymore cause when the craving hit when i was drinking it was on a different level and the fun was over for me. But to my surprise one night out i had fun for the first time without feeling the need to smoke. After 3 weeks it became a piece of cake and i don't get any sort of craving at this point even though all my friends and co-workers are smokers.

TLDR: Most important thing when quitting is to understand the structure of the craving, knowing that it won't last more than 45 mins, no more than 3 times a day. After it's over you will feel like you got your nicotine fix (In other words you will be back to normal) While pushing through a craving you will question yourself and the decision to stop as if you became a different person. It helps having supportive friends to get in touch with if you feel this way, and always remember that the feeling will pass on it's own and every time you beat it you will feel good about yourself, even more than the feeling of smoking itself. The minute you accept the cravings and learn how to deal with them mentally ( not with substitutes) you've basically won.",31,0

April 2021 I quit again. That lasted until the first few weeks at work after vacation. 

This time, I didn't wait I just kept trying to quit making it 72 hours then relapsing. I developed a really bad ear problem that came back every first day of quitting. 

The last time I quit, I had spoken to my therapists who after a year suggested medicine. 
The first day of my last quit, my ear became so infected I couldn't move my jaw. I went to the doctor and released my entire struggle. First, she treated the ear where she couldn't see my ear drum and I had two follow up appointments and three prescriptions before my ear was better. Second, she prescribed me an antidepressant medicine to help me quit. 

What a world of change. 
I had been self medicating for 10 years. I indeed had a mental health imbalance. I have never felt better. I barely have any cravings and I don't binge eat anymore. Don't get me wrong, I'm not numb or emotionless but I am able to handle things in a healthier way. If anyone keeps relapsing and is afraid to go to the doctor, don't be. Go. It changed my world and now I am able to confront past traumas that I think I was numb too before starting the medicine.",8,1

I also stopped drinking alcohol completely due to anxiety. 

This summer I made some friends at my job - I work in a pub - and as is quite typical everyone smokes and drinks. I started off having a few cigarettes on a night out. Then I would buy a pack and smoke them when I was going out and only allowed myself to smoke when I was drinking. My boss pointed out that this was a bad idea because it would encourage me to drink more. Two weeks ago one night at work I had a sober cigarette as I was very stressed and when I get angry or very upset the first thing I think to do is have a cigarette. I would have one in the evening when I left work. Then I began having 3 in the evening and today for the first time I‚Äôve felt cravings. I know I‚Äôm doing something bad and I feel terrible about it; I really don‚Äôt want to become a smoker again.

1. Yes you can manage stress without a smoke. Yeah you will get a craving because your brain circuits tell you that that is an occasion that you usually smoked. It's a circuit that is reprogramming. I have my midterms now and so far so good. Just had my accounting 101 exam, did pretty well.

2. Yeah you will avoid people and places where people smoke. I'm just a month in so that might change.

3. My alcohol consumption is down. Another perk. I just go out for drinks waaaay less. Extra money is amazing too.

4. Let the success of you not smoking propel you upwards. I'm much more motivated to lose weight or invest in myself now when at least one part of my self destructive nature is no longer here.

Overall it's been relatively straightforward which surprised me. But the past week has been stressful. 

Halfway through the week a friend announced a major life direction they're moving. I had some gut reactions based off on my own life that weren't fair. Thankfully they were kind and worked through my concerns with me. My sister and I earlier this week were frustrated by our miscommunication about holiday plans and talked through it. 

Last night my friend and I had a minor disagreement. We resolved it but I felt stressed. Tonight I interacted with my brother's fiance who is my ex spouse's sister. It all went fine but there's still some weirdness from our past there. I also talked about a heavy topic with my mom tonight connected to a close friend.  In short it's been a week of a lot of complicated hard discussions and experiences with a lot of energy expended. 

So my brain said oh screw it. Smoke the cigarettes. I could almost taste them and the failure as I washed dishes. I even planned to go buy them just to handle the anxiety and how life felt.  I thought I'd even have to do another post here about failing again and felt embarrassed and ashamed. So I can't really explain this. But something inside me said no.

I am unable to let go of the pleasures of Nicotine and need advice.","I (24M) used to smoke cigarettes, and then I started vaping to wean off. Unfortunately, I'm just as addicted to vaping now and though I've tried to stop, there's always a return in stages. The longer I go without smoking the worse the voice in my head becomes:

**Stages**

1. You haven't smoked in a couple of hours, would be amazing if you had a puff right now. (1-2 hours)
2. All you can think about is smoking, you don't care for anything else, just go outside. (3-5 hours)
3. Do you see how terribly you feel? How void of pleasure this feeling seems? (6+ hours)
4. SMOKE. JUST SMOKE. OR ELSE. (10+ hours)

I can never get past Stage 4 and it has cost me plenty of time, convenience and definitely my fitness. Through lockdown, I stopped working out and smoked all the time. The only times I didn't were when I'd had enough nicotine in my body.

I try to imagine a life where I don't crave nicotine, but I feel too weak to even ponder such existence. 

I've tried ridding myself of all nicotine from my home, but always find a way to get it, no matter what time or no matter the inconvenience.

I smoke as soon as I wake up. I've tried before to stop smoking in the morning, and have the first puff at midday, or after work, but unless I am 100% distracted it is all I can think about.

Has any of you had the same experience? I've heard of stories where people can simply *quit.* I have nicotine mints, but when the craving comes, I always choose the vape. 

I love the act of smoking. It's peaceful, quiet, and relaxing. It's the only time I'm not bombarded with thoughts. I can just be, but I know this is an unhealthy relationship with nicotine, and it needs to end.

I am going to try once and for all to rid myself of all my vapes, and stick to the mints. I would love to hear your stories or read some advice.",12,1

I've been trying to quit for a while. Recently I was on a holiday where I couldn't smoke and it made me realise that my addiction to nicotine is far weaker than my addiction to the act of smoking.
When I couldn't smoke I didn't have any cravings so after I got home I bought a vape with a high nicotine percentage but no matter how much I puffed my cravings never went away. The second I put a cigarette to my mouth however, my cravings subsided. 
Before this I tried nicotine pouches, gum and patches but they never worked and now I've realised that I'm very addicted to the act of smoking. 
My question is how do I overcome this addiction. I'm a law student and sometimes life gets very stressful which cranks my urges up to 1000. 
I reeeeeeeeealy want to quit, I'm young and this is my chance to avoid the worst side effects of smoking but I'm really struggling. 
Any help is greatly appreciated.

Nearly 40yo and I was a smoker for longer than a non-smoker. Quit for 9 weeks cold turkey. Just wanted to write down how it's going.

First thing - urges. Yes I still have them a couple of times a week. Not every minute of the day like in the beginning, but one minute I feel super confident and then the next minute everything is a craving. Especially bad with strong emotions like anger. Still did not find a way to really cope with it. Trying deep breaths. Want to start practicing mindful breathing.  
General breathing - First three weeks I noticed really improved breathing. Then my world became a horrible mucus apocalypse for 2 weeks and now my lungs are in a state that I like to call 'glue lung'. Feels like breathing through a filter coated with glue. It helps to do cardio though, and after running or biking it is better for a while. Some coughing after exercise and my throat hurts like hell, too.  Trying to build on that and hoping for the 6 month mark, because I am still pretty early in my quit.  
Random health scares - popping up now and then like chest pains and headaches and whatnot that I never even had a second thought about  when I was smoking. They all go away everytime.  
Sleep - My sleep feels a lot lighter now. Waking up every night at 3:30am but falling asleep after 15 minutes or so again. No idea why that is. Never had that as a smoker. Will hopefully go away.

For the postitive things: My gums look healthier, my teeth are cleaner, my skin color and texture have improved and I feel like I have a little more energy. Getting used to the improvments so quickly though.

A few weeks ago i was feeling so desperate to quit and wanted to see the doctor for some chemical aid. I heard from the pills called champix so i asked for that. Luck wasn't on my side since the stuff isn't available since July! So i had to postpone my plans to quit smoking for good.

Yesterday i was on the web reading some articles about champix only to discover the horrible side effects you might get from it.

That made me feel so lost and helpless.

But that quickly turnes into anger against all that is smoking that like a magic spell i can finaly say that at this moment for the first time in my life i haven't smoked in 24 hours!!!

I've always been very active and worked out at the gym.

Social smoker for 20 years - only every other weekend when out drinking.

This year, gradually picked up full time from June until August, was smoking 10-20 mentol cigarettes per day.

End of August I felt like sh*t. Horrible skin, no energy, chest infection etc. Time to call it a day. No more smokes or alcohol. Cold Turkey.

So it's been almost 3 months with no poison from alcohol or tobacco and I should now be starting to feel the benefits, right?

Wrong!

My skin is in a terrible state. Repeated bouts of Hives. Every night the itching is unbearable, rashes and dry skin everywhere. Bleeding. Doctors going through the usual blood tests, moisturisers and steroid creams. Nothing obvious showing up.

I'm at my wits end! Can't get a good night's sleep at all.

I can't even go to the gym now my skin is so bad and it's beginning to affect my mental health.

I saw a post on a sub that was smoking related and I commented on that, which led me to see if a sub like this one existed. So, since my mental block prevents me from speaking to people I know, I‚Äôll reach out (as instructed by my GP) with the mild anonymity that Reddit provides.  

I‚Äôve read a bunch of the ‚Äútips and tricks‚Äù on how to combat cravings, but it‚Äôs that kind of stuff that has me so concerned. I‚Äôm staggeringly aware of the limitations of my cognitive load, and it feels like this particular load won‚Äôt be lessened for the rest of my goddamned life! I keep hearing stories about how ‚ÄúI still have cravings after X years of quitting,‚Äù and I can‚Äôt help but ask if it‚Äôs all worth it anymore!

I‚Äôve got enough demons to fight without also having to convince myself that lowering the chances of adverse health conditions is better than instant gratification! 

And the _dreams_! I thought I had stamped out my night terrors about 15 years ago, but they‚Äôre back. It‚Äôs pretty hard to have a normal breakfast after spending all night at your own wake listening to everyone you love talk about how your suicide was probably the right thing. 

I know it‚Äôs early in the game, but in this moment, I‚Äôm not sure if the health benefits of the future outweigh the mental health detriments of the now.

You should have a specific problem you would like to work on.

I had been contemplating quitting for a long time but never gave it any real effort. After finishing my last pouch of tobacco I bought a vape pen instead and decided that this is going to be the last time I quit. I started at 12mg of nicotine then after a month I went down to 6mg. I have purchased some 0mg pods for when the one I am currently using runs out. Most days I leave the house without my vape and I barely get any cravings. I work in a pub with a few smokers and I never get the urge to ask them to have a cigarette, even when we are all sat around having a pint after a long day of work. In my mind I just think they are all disgusting for smoking.

This time just feels different. Having the right support system, quitting with other people and using apps on my phone have helped a lot. Me, my wife and my brother are all in this together and it feels great to all share the same goal. I have enjoyed running for a long time but I have not made any progress in a while due to smoking. I have just signed up to run my first marathon early next year and I cannot wait to keep training, see how fit I will be by the time it comes to race day and raise some money for charity. 

When I was smoking I couldn't dream of being 60 days smoke free and now weaning myself off of my vape pen. I think about how I would feel if I smoked again, to be back at square one. It would suck to lose all of the progress that I have made. I know that if I lit up again I would beat myself so bad mentally and want to be desperately back to where I was before smoking again. It's just not worth it at all.

On day 4 of no smoking.,"So here are my thoughts. The book gave me the motivation, tools, and drive to effectively stop the first two or three days without dreading it. This community has also been invaluable and I'm grateful for the fact I joined it. 

It was a combination of a lot of things that finally led me to stop. I got rid of everything nicotine related. Like the gum. The vape. All of it. Put it in a bag and threw it away. I can't avoid nicotine entirely since my roommates use Juul. Oddly though Juul doesn't tempt me. Fingers crossed that stays true. It's far easier to maintain sobriety from nicotine I've learned when nothing in my space gives me access to it. Any time the urge to smoke comes I remind myself ""You will still have to work through this stress/situation once that cigarette is over along with the problem of being a smoker. That means smoking the cigarette isn't worth it."" I didn't have that mindset before Allen Carr's book. 

I do have an addiction. It's easy to pretend like it's just casual. But I think that's the way smoking likes to trick me. You can stop whenever you want so you don't have to stop. I remind myself I'm not smoking just one cigarette if I cave. I'm smoking all of them. And so I won't smoke even the one. Overall my withdrawal symptoms have been manageable. I felt very restless and mildly upset last night. But I cross stitched and went to bed without smoking. I'm working on day by day thinking. All I have to do is get through this moment without a cigarette. And I can do that. I've also taken the pressure off myself by allowing this place to be my accountability location. It means I know people in my life won't give me feedback (even if it's kind and well meaning!) because they don't know. So things feel a lot safer and less stressful. 

I don't agree with everything in the Allen Carr book. I think he may not realize the impact poverty and mental illness can have with smoking. I think he can be overly repetitive and his mindset won't help everyone. But it made a big difference for me and that's what counts. He was the reason I got rid of all nicotine related products and I think that has made a huge difference.  It hasn't been easy. It also hasn't been as horrible as I thought it would be. I know I'll have days where the urge to not smoke is unbearable. And I'll have days where I forget I ever smoked. But what matters right now is today. So here's to day 4 of sobriety from nicotine and cigarettes.",37,0

4 years later im heavily addicted to nicotine mints. My dose for the last 4 years has been 20-40 of the 4mg lozenges daily. 

Meaning on a good day I'll take in about 80mg of nicotine in a 18 hour day. On a bad day its closer to 160mg. 

A year ago i woke up after being asleep unable to see with oscalating vision. Extremely weak, unable to move without falling down and very dizzy. Over the last year these episodes have got more and more frequent with me now having an episode about every 2-3 months in my sleep. My doctor has said that she believes i am having seizures caused by the NRT. Her words exactly was that 80mg of nicotine in a waking day was enough to cause nicotine poisoning. 

She told me to quit the NRT. 

I made a conscious effort to stop the high level of consumption per day. I bought some 21mg patches and some 1.5mg nicotine mints. I consumed 1 of the 1.5mg mints per hour and the patch delivered about 0.87mg of nicotine per hour continuously instead of my normal 4mg hourly. 

First day, felt a little strange and out of my head. Day 2 i woke up extremely tired and sore everywhere. My legs, chest, neck and arms feel like they have been beaten black and blue. My neck and chest feel like someone is sat on them. My eyes are burning with lots of pressure behind my eyes. I have genuinely throbbing pain in both sides of my temples and its by far the worst headache I've ever had. By mid day my vision is beginning to get bright and blurry and i feel dizzy and disorientated. 

By mid day i was unable to eat anything without vomiting and I've already had diarrhoea 3 times. The sight of food and water makes me feel like I'm going to vomit. 

At this point i got sent home from work as i could literally barely stand up straight. I had a 4mg mint on my way outside of work which has eased most of the symptoms but i still have the head pain, aching pains and throbbing eyes. Since the 4mg mint about 2 hours ago I've just had one of the 1.5mg mints every hour and my patch on. Its now going on 3 hours and i can feel the symptoms returning. 

I'm extremely scared and honestly i don't know what to do. If i keep taking the NRT I'm probably going to die. If i stop taking the NRT i cant work and I'm completely dysfunctional.

I've been a smoker/vaper for over 3 years now. I quit smoking and vaping around a week ago. Now I'm only using nicotine patches. I did try to quit before but nothing worked. This is the first time I've been smoke/vape free for more than 24 hours. I do have a lot of cravings even though I'm using 21 mg patches. I don't wat to use nicotine gum because I'm afraid I will use them all the time.

I was just wondering if anyone has any experience with quiting nicotine with nicotine patches. Did it help you in any way? I'm just wondering if I should just quit cold turkey to get it over with asap or keep on using nicotine patches and lowering the dose over time.

Thanks in advance :)",5,0

***The Contras:***

&#x200B;

\- discoloration of teeth

\- gum loss

\- lung damage

\- carediovascular diseases

\- skin aging

\- condition is less good

\- thins hair and stimulates hair loss

\- chance of cataract

\- psoriaris (red scaly patches on the skin, usually elbow)

\- erection problems

\- less fertile

\- takes a lot of your money

\- increased risk of getting diabetes

\- weaker bone

\- you can harass the non smokers

\- you lose life years

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***The smoking cessation timeline:***

&#x200B;

\- 20min : Within half an hour of your last cigarette, your heart rate and blood pressure typically drop to normal levels.

&#x200B;

\- 12hours : The level of carbon monoxide drops to normal, allowing oxygen to circulate more effectively in the blood.

&#x200B;

\- 1 day : The risk of a heart attack starts to decrease from now on.

&#x200B;

\-2 days : The sense of taste and smell will recover.

&#x200B;

\-3 days : Cigarette smoke inflames these pathways through which air moves in and out of your lungs. That can make it harder to breathe. But it starts to get much better just 72 hours after you quit as the tubes start to relax. You might notice a boost in energy, too.

&#x200B;

\-2 to 12 weeks : Blood circulation is greatly restored.

&#x200B;

\-1 to 9 months : You'll start to cough less and breathe better. Tiny hairs in your lungs called cilia start to grow back. These help clean out your lungs and lessons infection. Your lung function could go up by as much as 10%.

&#x200B;

\-1 year : Your risk of both heart disease and heart attack drop to about half that of a smoker.

&#x200B;

2 to 5 years : Your risk of mouth, throat, esophageal, and bladder cancers will be just half of what it was when you smoked. Your risk of cervical cancer will fall to that of a nonsmoker.

&#x200B;

5 years : your risk of stroke could fall to the same as that of someone who doesn't smoke.

&#x200B;

10 years : Your lung cancer risk is a half that of a person who still smokes. At this time, your risk of cancer of the larynx and of the pancreas also goes down.

&#x200B;

15 years : Your risk of both heart disease and heart attack is now the same as someone who has never smoked.

***Tips to quit smoking***

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\- Handling nicotine products such as chewing gum or plasters.

\- Avoid or reduce coffee and alcohol consumption.

\- Perform sports

\- Cravings? Pressing cold water through a straw or eating a snack / keep your mind busy with something else such as learning a skill or having a paperback book in your pocket, learning a language in the meantime, ...

\- Start smoking cessation together with someone, it stimulates.

I'm reaching out in an attempt to get some advice and support on this long, and seems to be never-ending struggle of mine...

I'm a nicotine addict and I'm almost giving up hope on myself. I started smoking when I was 18 (I'm 27 now), and I am absolutely serious when I say, I think I've quit smoking about 40-50 times. I have tried vaping, nicotine patches, nicotine spray and nicotine gums. The one thing that have worked for me is the nicotine spray, but when I use it I end up being addicted to it for months! And once I have the strength to quit with the spray, it does not take long until I'm back with the cigarettes again.

I have not been nicotine free for more than a couple of months ever since I started smoking.

As late as yesterday I had anxiety and ran out and bought a pack. Smoked five cigarettes and felt even more anxious because I felt bad for smoking. I threw the pack in the trash and felt motivated enough to do a 15min workout this morning. Later in the evening, when I passed by the dumpster in the stairwell, I opened the dumpster to check if my trash bag was still there... that would mean I could get my pack of cigarettes if I really wanted. To my relief, the trash bag was still there and this whole evening all my energy have gone to trying to stay away from going to the dumpster and pick up the damn cigarettes from the trash!

I'm quite interested in meditation, even though I don't practice it that often anymore, and I know that's probably what I should be doing... but in the moments of stress and anxiety, I feel so weak-minded and I always go back to smoking.

I would really appreciate if anyone in here could share their thoughts on this matter and help me out a little! I'm going absolutely nuts on myself and this addiction...

Thanks!",5,0

Every day I wake up and I think about how nice a cigarette would be. Every time I go out to the shed to smoke some weed I see the vape and think about how I found a bunch of nic juice in that old backpack. Every time my wife has a seizure-like event I start thinking about how much better care I'd take of them if I wasn't so stressed.

My coworkers dip out for smoke breaks regularly due to the incredibly stressful nature of our job and every time the urge to ask if I can bum one gets stronger. I can smell it in the air through the stench of the trash compactor and the biohazard bin. Even if they go further out I can smell it on them through an N95. 

We clean up after infectious diseases in a hospital and shit has been pretty fucking rough these last few months. Our county had the highest transmission rate in the state and second highest in the country. Even without covid I'm regularly exposed to things like tuberculosis and they just replaced our special tuberculosis-cide quat with ""half a cup of bleach to one gallon of water"" which I'm not entirely convinced will actually do enough. 

Why the hell should I let myself suffer now for the benefit of a hypothetical future version of me that doesn't even fucking exist? If I get in an accident or die from catching tb on the job will it even have mattered?",89,3

I relapsed. When I had quit back in February, I had used this subreddit along with Alan Carr's methods to quit smoking. I did actually find the experience pleasant as he claims in the books.

However, it's been very stressful at work. I have an anxiety disorder which is heavily related to my job & performance, so I've been under a lot of pressure. This was when I used to smoke the most.

It started as ""You know, I'll just have one pod (I used to smoke Juul) just for old time's sake. I'll just take one pod, & throw out the device & the rest of the pods."" Unfortunately, I did this...6 or 7 times. Sometimes I would smoke 2 & throw out 4, or smoke one & toss it. The people who sold these to me at the gas station probably thought I was crazy.

That's unfortunately a lot of money to squander. I Justified it by ""Hey, I just got my bonus, I can afford it."" I cannot believe I gave my hard earned bonus to that damned company. They only sell them in 2-4 at a time & make it so easy to go overboard on them.

I had this sudden realization, after making excuses for myself...that I had relapsed. 

I just told myself it was just ""one more pod"", but here I am. 

I was smoking on days when I wasn't hanging out with my girlfriend, & not smoking on the days we would spend time with each other. I haven't told her because...I never thought I was actually back to smoking. I kept telling myself ""Well, you're not fully smoking, right? It's just one little bit"". It's been two weeks.

The reason why I'm speaking in all past tense is because I am not a smoker from this moment onward. I will be quitting using the same learnings that I had from the first time around, & understand that the addiction is heavily psychological. I could do it once, & I know that I could do it again. 

I have all the confidence in the world in myself, just like I have the confidence in **all of YOU** because we are all going through this together. 

I've quit, so can you, & I intend to do it with you. Let's beat this addiction.",10,0

Hi, gang. 

I smoked in college - no big deal, it helps you focus in finals. Then kept the habit up in the real world - why not? Quit for a while, picked it back up in grad school after finding out there was some secret listserv for jobs and internships I had been intentionally left off of. Then for another few years. I'm sure, gun to your head, you could find a legitimate reason for it, too.

Thing is, I had to practice quitting. And I got a lot of practice. I tried e-cigarettes back when they were first new: I remember there were like 3 brands to choose from, one of which had a blue light at the end. You know, just so you could obnoxiously point out to the waitstaff on the patio, ""I'm *technically* not actually smoking."" I tried. the gum. I tried the patch - and to be honest, that feeling when you first put it on, like a shot of Jameson on a cold winter morning 10 minutes after it finally tuck - that was nice.

But what got me over the line was when I realized that, while smoking, I was already counting down the time till I could have my next cigarette. This was supposed to be fun, right? But how could I be enjoying it if I was actively, in the midst of it, already trying to figure out when I could do it again? Add to that the occasional morning oyster, and there was just no sense in doing it any more. It was hard to quit when I was abstaining from something I actively liked. But when I realized I didn't *like* it any more...that's what got me to the finish line. 

I occasionally want one, on a hot summer day when I remember going to Coney Island and having a smoke and a cold beer. But you start learning that it really contributed nothing to your life, and so there's nothing to regret about not having it around. 

Anyway, not that that's any sort of motivation. But you've got this.",54,0

 I said I would make a post should I make it to day 7, and here we are.

My ability to quit this time is due to a trifecta of perfectly aligned factors. 

1. QuitSure app
2. support person
3. good place mentally

I will now discuss each of these factors. My goal is to debrief about my quitting journey and also provide more content for anyone wanting to soak up some inspiration to quit.

1. I downloaded the app because another user on this sub suggested it in their post. I got part of the way into day 1 of the program and it asked me for $13CAD or something. At this point I decided I would take the program seriously because I'm paying for it. I shut off my brain and gave complete trust to the program. I would focus on what is working in the program and not question anything because the promise from the program is that I would quit. I was completely at the mercy of the program. I followed all instructions perfectly, especially the instruction to continue smoking throughout the 6 days. I'm not going to give any spoilers here, but I will say that the approach of the program was effective for me and it made me think of cigarettes and quitting in a completely different way. It is put together so well. I believe that I would not have been able to quit without it.
2. My support person is my boyfriend. He quit a long time ago. He has been so patient with me. I couldn't imagine dating a smoker now that I've quit. He's been my cheerleader. I admire his courage in encouraging me to quit. He somehow knew exactly how much to get on my case about smoking, without making me just want to avoid him so I could smoke in peace. He went away for business a few weeks ago and I had promised him that I would be a non-smoker by the time he got back. This put an insane amount of pressure on me and I was so mad at myself for making a promise I probably couldn't keep. So when someone recommended QuitSure I was like, welp, here goes nothing. It feels really good to have someone on my side through this and I don't believe I would have quit at this point in my life if it wasn't for him.
3. I've been smoking for a long time and I've attempted to quit multiple times. I've driven myself insane over this smoking business. Such a mindfuck. When I decided to just let go and realize I am not capable of quitting on my own, through my own power, it became easier to initiate the quit attempt. I fucked this up too many times, I need help. It actually felt good to be vulnerable and so desperate for a solution that I gave my entire soul to a stupid app. I was open and honest with my boyfriend about how I felt. I told him how scared I was to go through this.

What I'm about to say will not apply to everyone, and might invite controversy, but, I attribute a great deal of my success to finally understanding that I will never quit permanently if I attempt to keep some form of nicotine replacement in my life. I tried the patch before, the nicorette inhaler, vaping. They all lead right back to smoking. I want to be FREE.

Another thing is the booze. Every time I failed a quit attempt, alcohol was involved. I haven't had a drink since I quit and I'm terrified to even try drinking a beer. Maybe I just won't. I've been down that road. I fell into the hole. I went down the road again and still fell into the hole. I need to take a different road. It felt really good to sip on a dandelion tea lastnight. I was drinking something that helps my liver instead of damaging it.

I don't have much else to add right now. Several edits to follow, probably. :D

Have a great day/everything.",14,0

I went 11 months this time around but a little bit of rough week, a little bit of depression and I broke and as disappointed as I was that I broke, I really enjoyed it, I've missed it, and it felt so good to smoke, to hold it I'm my fingers, to hear that cracking as you take a long drag after a rough service.(im a chef) I've missed it. What I don't miss. Waking up in the middle of the night short of breath having to pull on my inhaler, the ashtray taste in your mouth in the morning coupled with the sore throat. I want to desperately to make it stick this time. I went 3 years before and I went 11 months now. I'm hoping that posting here will help me a bit, maybe encouragement from people also actively working at quitting will encourage me, hearing the success stories, maybe actually framing my difficulty quitting as struggling with an addiction and giving it its proper place in terms of difficulty (I feel weird calling it a struggle with addiction when people are struggling with worse addictions) well that's it, that's what came to mind this morning. I hope feeling compelled to write this helps, I definitely didn't mean for it to be this long. Here's to day one. Cheers.

Feel so much better. But today I put an unlit cig in my mouth as a joke & feel like I relapsed even tho I'm sure I didn't smoke it.Ôªø Fuck OCD. Still, the ‚Äãworst days sober are still better then the best days high","I was trying to show off/act silly to my friend that I can have a cigarette in my mouth and have the control to not smoke it. However, right after that, I had a hard obsession if I did light it or not. OCD made it near impossible to stop for years, but here I am, one month smokefree, 20th October 2021.

I feel so much more alive, confident and less anxious. I look so much better cause I stopped everything cold turkey. However OCD and anxiety still throw everything at me daily to relapse, but I won't give in. I have more compulsions about smoking then cravings to be honest. Like: ""you had a cigarette in your mouth, you sure you didn't smoke it/have a little nicotine in you by having it in your mouth and so on'' and it makes me feel like I'm relapsed even tho I'm sure I didn't. So not only cravings make it hard, but these OCD obsessions make it the hardest thing ever. It would make me relapse even though I don't want to.

I have no cravings anymore since day 2 because I started working out from day 1. I was sick of feeling sick. An anxious, coughing mess, I was looking more forward to quitting then destroying myself (kinda the Allen Carr method, not dreading the quit process but actually enjoying it.)

I remember flushing my weed and cigarettes the day before I quit only to get more the day after. Then I said, if I don't quit now, I will never succeed.  I also obsessed about quitting ''the perfect way/date/on the perfect number/not on a 13 and so on. It was almost impossible, but not totally impossible. I also stopped another OCD compulsion, formatting my PC at the slightest error and reinstall Windows 10 times a day. I stopped everything that's bad for me on that day. It's the hardest thing I ever did, but the most rewarding.

Even though OCD is throwing everything at me to relapse, I am looking forward to month 2 and staying smokefree for the rest od my life. 

I even went clubbing sober without cigarettes/weed and alcohol. Really challenging myself.

The worst days sober are still better then the best days high. Proud of myself",39,0

Many people still pick up smoking because they believe they will be able to smoke occasionally or quit before they get too addicted - I know that‚Äôs what I thought when I picked up smoking. 

What isn‚Äôt as talked about is what happens to your brain when you smoke. Every time you pick up a cigarette after finishing a meal, you are training your brain to expect a cigarette after every meal. THIS is what makes cigarettes truly addictive. THIS is what makes it so hard to quit even if you use nicotine replacement (like patches or gum.) If my 18 year old self had understood this, I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve picked up the habit.

I see it as a positive so far, though. They‚Äôre not bad dreams. Some have been pretty damned entertaining! And last night, the act of quitting made its way into the theme! I kept realizing that -out of nowhere, I had a cigarette in my hand and it was pissing me off. I can‚Äôt even count how many dream-cigarettes I stomped out! It felt good to squish them and made me upset that they kept reappearing in my hand. 

I feel like this is subconscious progress being made.",3,0

Quitting was a struggle initially but I powered through. The withdrawals sucked but the craving was the core struggle; even once the withdrawals passed, I often flirted with the idea of a having a cigarette.

What eventually helped me quit was the following:
-	Not restarting the counter whenever I gave in to a cigarette or two or three etc.
-	Tossing the pack in an outside trash can immediately after giving in. 
-	Journalling whenever I had a craving and reminding myself why I‚Äôm quiting

With time, I reached a stage where I didn‚Äôt have cravings anymore and I would genuinely feel sick when smoking a cigarette. 

Now I‚Äôve restarted since the one cigarette catapulted into a few every two days. Until recently where I‚Äôm at a pack every two days again.

240,2021-11-18 10:27:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/qws5gd/turn_and_fucking_run/,Turn and Fucking Run,"An excerpt from something I wrote today while trying to stay off of tobacco (among other things). Apologies if it's a bit of a ramble and isn't only smoking-related - though it certainly is the main villain of the piece.  


\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
I am currently ill with my most recent bout of the fucktard-flu, or *allergic rhinitis*, as the medical community prefers to call it. I prefer fucktard-flu because it‚Äôs caused by my mild-to-moderate smoking habit. I always wanted to have something named after me. 

The illness has led to my most recent bout of sobriety and a renewed focus on trying to be ‚Äúbetter‚Äù. I don‚Äôt mean to come across as glib - I truly do want to be better. I know what a life of smoking, sugar and‚Ä¶ it would be great if there was a third vice that began with the letter ‚Äòs‚Äô here but I‚Äôve been in a monogamous long-distance relationship for almost 4 years now so there‚Äôs been little (none) of that lately. Anyway, I haven‚Äôt smoked in three days, eaten sugar in 2 days and had sex in 4 years. Well, that last part is an exaggeration but I‚Äôm trying to lighten the mood here. 

The irony is that despite not having all my go-to dopamine fixes on hand to snap myself out of the rather miserable reality I find myself in, despite the pain from the catch in my upper back that was the only tangible outcome of the endless toss-and-turn that passed itself off as sleep last night, or the sharp discomfort in my chest each time I cough, the dull-headedness of constantly stuffed up sinuses, even the steady drumming of rain that has been falling for so long that the sky looks like it will forever contain in it indelible patches of insipid grey, despite it all I seem to prefer this than chasing highs all the goddamn time.

From the bluish faux-benign allure of screens and content that trade your attention and vitality for voyeuristic fantasies of better faces and bodies and partners and stories.  

To the euphoric rush of silken fructose onto a tongue that soon burns and into a stomach that soon aches with the pain of a poison so *passe* it‚Äôs pathetic.  

Or the dreamy fog of marijuana with its ability to turn the most mundane of life‚Äôs moments into a haze of never-remembering, forever adrift in an ocean of lost time.  

And, of course, the frayed-wire buzz of the lord of all vices, that evil plant that burrows its spine-filled tendrils around every waking thought and impregnates your soul with a desire almost as stunning as your amazement that it vanished in the precise moment you cave and give in - only to raise its serpent head again the instant the burning ends. Like lamplight that promises lost travelers a way out only to draw them further into the darkness, the tobacco ‚Äúhigh‚Äù, if it can even be called that, is the most insidious of them all.  

Yet, from my admittedly unearned and possibly undeserving sanctuary on the other side of that fence of all temptation, I feel sure that I prefer it *here*. That I prefer being sober and clear-headed with a belly devoid of sugar and a mind that is present and whose consciousness has not been sold for false calm. 

I know this as sure as my own name. 

But I am equally sure that far too soon the sirens' call will echo once more and I will again be drawn to the very edge and made to look out into those wild and tempestuous waters that beckon me off the deck. I am sure that every fiber of my being will ache to answer their call. 

Suddenly all my current clarity and wisdom will be but a distant dream seen through old glass. 

Every sputtered cough and wheezing breath will seem as harmless as an old wives' tale uttered to frighten precocious children.  

And all I will want to do at that moment is dive in. To plunge headfirst into those rapturous waters that only seek to drown me. 

Fitting as apparently, the fluid build-up in smokers‚Äô lungs literally makes you feel like you‚Äôre drowning.  

And all the self-hatred leading up to it will make you feel like you‚Äôd rather be dead anyway. 

So when next you hear the call - not if but *when* \- read this first. 

Step away from the edge. 

Please. 

*Turn and fucking run.*",15,0

I must have posted 1000 times here already but I really want to share something with all of you and to remind myself of what I've achieved. 

I was a heavy smoker, 1 or 2 packs per day and that lasted for around 2 years. In the beginning I was smoking around 10-15 cigarettes but then I increased like everyone does. I started coughing and I would get tired after 5 minutes of doing exercises. I got gastritis because of fucking cigarettes and that bothered me during the first few weeks of quitting. I gained a lot of weight, mainly in the abdomen area because of how some antidepressants worked on me and also because of the smoking and my diet and of course beacuse of the lockdown in 2020. 

As the time passed, I smoked more and more and it seemed that I was cought in the vicious cycle of smoking and buying lots of packs and pouches of tobbacco. My teeth became yellow and stained, I got tartar and I still have to see a dentist for that. 

I wanted to quit for a long time but I would always say not today, this is too difficult or Id make up some other excuse. I started watching lots of youtube videos and reading articles on smoking.One day I decided to buy patches. I'm still on them but Im on the lower dosage ( 15mg/16h ) . Two days ago, Ive actually been without a patch for the whole day and I didn't notice any cravings at all! My psychiatrist told me not to quit cold turkey and knowing that it may vary from person to person, if you can't stop at once, try patches. This post isn't sponsored for by Nicorette or something like that, I'm just sharing my experience and what worked for me.

Fast forward to today, I began doing exercises and started eating healthy, no more sugars or junk food. I really started taking care of my health and my self worth and well being. I have Obssessive Compulsive Disorder, depressive episodes and low self esteem but I somehow managed to overcome the addiction to nicotine. Im in a way certain that I won't give in again to cigarettes and I hope that with the new meds that I got and my new way of life, Ill be healthier and have a better quality of life.

My loved ones and the things I love to do like gaming helped a lot in staying quit. I have the support of many people whom I care about and I spend my free time playing video games and studying for my bachelor's degree and here and there reading some books and watching stuff.  
Sorry for the long post, I just wanted to share some info with people who may need it.

Believe in yourself and everything's possible. YOU CAN QUIT and YOU CAN CHOOSE THE BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR LOVED ONES. Don't let yourself be miserable by being anxious over how many cigarettes you have left or by going at 2AM to buy some more during fricking cold weather and snow for example.

All the best! YOU GOT THIS!",11,1

So now I am just excited to see how I handle day 3.

The urge to smoke just comes every once in a while, but although I smoked for 10 Years 1pack/day, I am suprised, that it¬¥s just 2 or 3 times a day, that I have to fight my inner demon.

Read this book first. So I bought it on my kindle on an impulse rolling my eyes. I'm about 40 pages in. My motivation to stop smoking a few days ago didn't work the way I wanted it too. This meant I was shocked when he told me to keep smoking within the first few pages. It's the first time anybody has ever said that. And my initial gut reaction was what the hell? why does that make me want to stop? This is the first time I've been told hey you don't have to be afraid of stopping. Like that's what was stopping me. The fear. And having someone say yeah let's lay it out kind of is blowing my mind. 

""I‚Äôm not a violent man, but if some patronizing non-smoker had been stupid enough to suggest to me that all smokers can find it easy to quit, immediately and permanently, I would not have been responsible for my actions. However, I‚Äôm convinced that any jury in the world, comprised only of smokers, would have pardoned me on the grounds of justifiable homicide.""

This is my first post here. I quit vaping 40mg daily last Monday on November 8th. I‚Äôm 22 and I‚Äôve been using nicotine since I was around 18. It‚Äôs crazy how much my withdrawal changes day by day. One day I‚Äôll feel amazing then the next day I‚Äôll feel irritated, confused, out-of-it, tired, and depressed.

It seems like the only thing that helps me feel normal is exercising or taking a hot bath. 

Today was rough. I got annoyed easily by the people around me. My sore throat that I‚Äôve had for the last week has gotten worse. My lymph nodes are swollen as hell. It‚Äôs weird because I don‚Äôt want to use nicotine again, I know it‚Äôll make these problems worse. It‚Äôs just surprising to me how I‚Äôm going through these effects. Nicotine is a strong chemical.

I apologize for the lack of enthusiasm. I‚Äôm really happy that I decided to remove nicotine from my life. I know that over time this will get easier. It‚Äôs hard now, but this struggle is absolutely worth it. I just hope that come next week I‚Äôll feel better physically and mentally.

Another weird thing I‚Äôve noticed is that I feel the best in the evening, during daylight I feel less energetic than I‚Äôm used to but at night I don‚Äôt notice it as much.

But As difficult as the first few days were the emotional roller coaster has been pretty crazy as well. Depression and anxiety mixed with a sense of impending doom seems to be my flavor of dragon to slay. When it comes to quitting. 

The only reason I even bring this up is because so want to make sure it actually IS the withdrawal symptoms. This seems pretty crazy and I wanted to make sure this was something someone else went through and it wasn‚Äôt just me.

I've smoked for over 30 years. I recently had to see an ENT (dr) and will be having surgery next month because my sinuses are f'ed. That was the impetus to get me to quit. There is also the price of cigs, which is ever-increasing. So, I quit, cold turkey, @ 1800 on Nov 9.

I've done it once before, about 10 years ago and I lasted 9 months. I fell into the ""I'll just have one"" trap. I know it's not going to be easy, and I hope I can make it through the next year without losing my resolve. I already have that voice in my head telling me ""just one, that's all, just one...."" 

I feel SO good, and I know I smell better. My car smells better. My house smells better. I have tons of energy, already - after only one week. I'm sleeping better, and I wake up in the morning full of energy and ready to go, instead of being groggy and croaky and disoriented.

I'm using the QuitNow app and enjoy seeing my progress. Hard to believe how quickly the money, and the # of cigs add up.

QUIT DAY 2, I went to bed at 11.00pm. I don't know if it was because I was so tired from the day before but I woke up just before my alarm in the morning at 6.08am. I was delighted to get some sleep and beat the 6.30am alarm but my good god - what was that smell?

I live in London, my first instinct was fuck there must be a dead rat in here. It smells awful. I looked in the mirror to see my face. It was all screwed up from that smell alone - like I just ate a lemon and sat on barbed wire. I jumped out of bed, my mouth was super dry so I decided head to the kitchen. 

As I jumped out of bed it was made worse. As the blanket let me out of bed, it also push the air around the room. If I had to give this invisible smell a visual imagine the gas soaked trenches of world war I movies. I closed my bed room door tightly and headed to the kitchen. 

I drank a glass of water, then another and another. My mouth felt like a desert and the smell made me so nauseous. 

What was that? 

Thank god my nose work me up. I thought to myself it smelled dead but gassy, then my mind put 2+2 together. 

My boiler is in my bedroom, maybe a rat ate through the gas pipe and died. Releasing some sort of smell that hasn't been smelled by man before. 

I opened all the windows. Put rubber gloves on. Put me face mask on. Ready to enter the bedroom. All my windows on the flat are skylights so I grabbed my pole to open the windows. 

If one of these rat fucks had broken my gas pipe and was still there. They would have hell to pay. Imagine the Walter White from the first episode of Breaking Bad. A man in his pants, wearing a face mask and rubber gloves with a big stick with a hook on the end. I enter the room dressed as a pinnacle specimen of a middle aged man in his pants. I still smell that God awful stank. It ran through the mask but I quickly cracked open the window and start fanning to get some air around the room. 

After a couple of minutes things smelled better. 

I checked the boiler, all fine. 
I checked all the pipes, all fine. 
I checked under the bed, all fine. 
I checked the bedding, all fine. 
I checked the closet, all fine. 
Everything I check was all fine. 

Then where on earth did that smell come from. Maybe if it was a rat it quickly moved on after I jumped out of bed. I don't know. At this point my belly is rumbling. 

I go into the kitchen and open my fridge. To my surprise, I  have one bottle of Aloe Vera water in the fridge (it's a God send, serve ice cold for firey smoking cessation chests) and yogurt + blueberries. 

Damn, this is a good breakfast for QUIT DAY 2. It will take my mind off this morning's smell ordeal. For the life of me I just don't know what that was. 

I sat down to have breakfast, all of a sudden my belly is rumbling. Not a hunger rumble, this is some richter scale, seismic aftershock kind of rumble. It went on for 10-16 seconds...this hadn't happened before. I look at my stomach confused. 

I know smoking does all sorts to your system. I've been on and off so much. But this was new. I ate the first spoonful of my breakfast, the rumble returned but this time, it was ANGRY. 

I swear beyond the rumble, my stomach spoke my name. 

It rumbled, and rumbled, groaning louder and louder, until. 

It happened. 

The biggest fart I've ever done. It had the volume of a G20 jet engine taking off with the accoustic sounds only a orchestra playing at Carnegie Hall would want. It was long and loud. Stating it's significance in my own personal history as being the loudest fart I have ever farted. 

As a man, I was somewhat proud of such a feature. Then what followed was a symnothy of smells, all too familiar. Like old milk mixed with warm orange juice. Like a used baby nappy that had been dragged across a barbershop floor and then incenerated. Then that gas. 

The smell hit me harder than the FART ever could. 
I was that smell. I enter my QUIT DAY 3 awoken by my own fart. If that's not motivation to get to QUIT DAY 4, then I don't know what is. 

Does anyone else experience stomach issues on the first QUIT WEEK? Any advice?",17,3

TL;DR Give me all the advice you have on how to stop, I finally want to be able to live smoke free.

Long version: I am 22 and I have stopped smoking twice already. 3 Years ago I was sick for a week and couldn't physically smoke because it made me vomit. A while after that I started again during a vacation and I stopped again a few months later. Just to start again because of social situations and my own stupidity. That was about a year ago and I couldn't stop yet.

I am lacking willpower and discipline. I git fairly lucky in my life and for most things I didn't have to do anything. I never learned what it meant to put effort into something. I am that kind of person who always takes the easy way out if possible.

I am starting to see some problems caused by smoking, I am coughing all the time, my voice sounds rough, I am poor and I can barely afford my living. Yet I can't seem to find a way to stop smoking, it may work for a day or two but I always go back to smoking after that and I am seriously starting to hate myself for my lack of discipline and my weakness.

My mother stopped after 45 years and I myself stopped smoking 2 times in the past so it must be doable somehow, I just don't know where to pull the energy from that it costs.

Smoking is shit. It costs money like hell, it is unattractive, it stinks, it is unhealthy, I'm almost exploding when I have to go 2 hours plus without cigarettes. I play the guitar and I love to sing but now I can't even do that because I just have to cough every 30 seconds. I want to stop and get rid of it but I can't seem to do it.

So yeah, if you made it this far thanks for reading my story. I don't even know what I expect from this, I guess I hope I can use this as some kind of motivation. But please, if you have any input for me like some tips or if you want to tell me your story and how you made it, feel free to write a comment :)

Something I can read back when I need to remind myself what an idiot I've been.

I quit in may with the aid of Allen Carr's book and reading posts here. It was rough in the beginning, but I surprised myself with how well I was doing. I felt absolutely great about quitting, was already reaping the benefits. Felt healthier and saved a bunch of money every month. By the time I hit the three month mark I felt absolutely confident that I had done it. Days would go by without any cravings or even thoughts of smoking. I got cocky and thought I had kicked the habit. Friends, family and colleagues were with me all the way and they were all so supportive. 

Then I relapsed. If I hadn't relapsed then I would be at the six month mark right now. Absolutely kicking myself over it. I don't remember exactly when I had my first cigarette, but like an idiot I fooled myself into thinking that surely I wouldn't go back to smoking. Fast forward a few months and here I am pretty much back to smoking daily. Smoked on and off for weeks, all the while still lying to myself about how I wouldn't start back up again. These past few weeks I've been buying packs again and I've been struggling with myself constantly. Even lying to my friends and hiding my habit from them like a dirty little rat because I don't have the balls to tell them that I'm back to smoking again. Been having sleepless nights over it and I feel enormous guilt towards myself and my loved ones.

Over the past week I've bought 3 packs and thrown them away half empty. Tonight I couldn't take it anymore, had to make a clear decision to throw away my remaining cigarettes and write this post. Writing something like this along with follow ups was a massive help for me when I quit cannabis and I should have done it when I quit last time. 

I will not smoke anymore and I will force myself to read this post if I need to in the future. I feel like an idiot for throwing away months of progress, but I've now made a choice to stop being that idiot. I also vow to tell everyone who needs to know about my behaviour to clear my conscience.

I haven't had a cigarette in around seven years and haven't vaped in around 4. Ever since I stopped smoking I have constantly wanted to start smoking again. I really enjoyed a cigarette in the morning, with coffee, after a meal or as a method to cope with anxiety or stress. I started smoking on occasion at 13 (whenever I could get cigarettes) and started smoking regularly at 16 so I have been a non smoker longer than a smoker. Honestly the last couple of years have been a real struggle not to start again, I know that I shouldn't start smoking again but I am at the point where I am almost unable to function due to stress and anxiety, which smoking fixed!. I know there are much healthier coping mechanisms but unfortunately my coping mechanism has always been smoking!. 

Tldr, I have been off cigarettes for 7 years, I am stressed as fuck and feel like I would be better smoking again.

Answering to your post, nowadays, in the present, you drink alcohol with friends without thinking of going back to smoke, because you have realized that the fun you have with friends does not come from smoking or alcohol, but it comes from friendship. So, keep strong no matter what. And if you fell like crying sometime, do it. It's ok. You can't image how proud you will feel about yourself in 6 years.

Maybe the title is misleading or wrong, sorry English is not my first language.

I've been smoking since 2013. I tried quitting a couple months ago but relapsed after 10days. My excuse was stress. My stress management is very poor lately due to the whole covid-19 thing going on. Mandates and everything. I had been diagnosed with GAD before so last 2 years hasn't been very well for me. 

I don't know how I never knew and thought about this before but today I learnt that tobacco products are being tested on animals. I'm a vegetarian trying to go vegan and I rescue animals too, I have cats who are also second hand smokers because of me. 
This information gave me another motivation to quit. At least to try again. I quit meat cold turkey years ago, now I'm hoping to do the same with cigarettes because obviously I care more about animals. For sure this is going to be harder. 

I don't know if this sounds stupid but yes, that's my actual motivation right now.

I started smoking to deal with my suicidal thoughts and anxiety. In a lot of ways it took the place of cutting and felt like a compromise to the suicidal idealization. When my marriage was falling apart I began to smoke every day to deal with it all. 

My divorce is finalized now though. I've been on my medication consistently for about a year and a half. I'm in therapy weekly. And I think it's time to finally confront this. Knowing I've failed repeatedly feels very disheartening and makes me feel a little defeated before even beginning. When I'm having intrusive thoughts, smoking gave me the ability to navigate. But it also took away a lot of my power for managing things myself. So I need to let go of this crutch and work on accepting my mental illness and using techniques from therapy without relying on addiction. I am more then this. 

I'm writing this to all of you because you're where I am or where I want to be. I'm writing this to remind myself I can do it. It's time. I've downloaded a quit smoking app. And I'm scared.

Today marks my 13 year anniversary of a separation of a dear friend that I had close relationship with for nearly 20 years. A friend that was always there through thick and thin, was there to calm me down when I was mad, and just in general kept me company on long road trips.

But was also a friend that limited me, where I went, and who I could and would visit. A friend that unbeknownst to me, dictated a huge part of my life. Someone I thought could do no wrong and bent over backwards for. The last year leading to our breakup, I had exactly realized how much of my life had been robbed by this friend. How limiting they were and how it affected my family. It was after another good friend was able to successfully cut ties with my friend, I realized that I, too, could cut ties forever.

Thanks to a good friend, I realized I could, in fact, quit smoking. So long, to living my life, looking for the next location to have a smoke. Going outside in all sorts of weather, to have a smoke. Having to tip-toe and hide around certain people, to have a smoke. Running though the airport to find a smoking lounge between flights. Having that eau de cigarette odor. Realizing how much time, energy, and money that has, literally, gone up in smoke. It has not always been easy, and I've had to keep my eye on the prize, but I know my life is much better off without my blinding addiction. Set a date that was important to me, and kept my promise to be done with it forever.

THIRTEEN years.

Not a single cigarette, not a single drag (as I believe I would be right back). It does not bother me as much, now, but I know there are days where I could make up with my friend, and have to make a conscientious decision to stay away.

The addiction is strong, and for a long time, I was weak. Knowing that I have had close family that have died as a direct result of smoking wasn‚Äôt a deterrent. Sin taxing wasn‚Äôt a deterrent. People telling my how bad it was (duh!) didn‚Äôt help. After I realized that someone (I perceived) was a heavier smoker was able to quit, it opened my eyes to a possibility that I could do it. So I do want to give a quick thanks to those that are close to me for having to put up with me during my journey! Maybe I will be around longer to aggravate you! To those of you, my friends and acquaintances, or anyone reading my story, that thinks they are resolved to a life of smoking, that it is too hard, or you have been at it for too long, just know, that if you have the will to quit, you CAN.

But you have to be honest with yourself, and do it for yourself, not at anyone else‚Äôs behest. If you resolve to quit on your own terms, you will succeed, as I have.

Thank you.",82,0

I'm new here but so many posts helped inspire me to quit so I wanted to share how I was able to break the chain with minimal to no discomfort. I still have 0 intention to start again & no desire for any cigarettes whatsoever! Two weeks ago, I never would've imagined it would be like this, I prepared for hell. I'm not here to brag or boost or look for validation, just to share what is working for me and hopefully works for others.

Keep in mind it does come with a price tag, but no where near the amount you'd spend in a lifetime on cigarettes.

1. Read the book ""**The Easy Way to Stop Smoking**"" by Allen Carr (+find as many government resources as you can). I was fortunate enough to find a free PDF online.

Without the knowledge in this book I don't know if I'd be as confident or motivated as I was in myself - it's all about your frame of mind. Take notes & save them for #4

Seriously.... if you haven't read this book you are missing the hidden secrets of why quitting smoking can be easy. With the lessons I learned here nothing else I say here would make a difference.

2. NRT - **Nicotine patches & I got a prescription of Champix** (quit smoking aid) which takes a few weeks to lower the dose

3. **CBD oil** \- some drops beneath your tongue in the morning

4. Download **multiple Quit apps** \- I use Quit Now & Smoke Free. The notes I took from Allen Carr's book I copied into these apps as my ""reasons to quit""

5. Now the 5th is circumstantial - I recently got invisalign teeth aligners that must stay in my mouth 20-22 hours a day. It works like a mental and physical block so as long as they are in I know 100% I cannot smoke (my quit plan was forced or else I'd continue to be smoking right now).  Go see your dentist or othordontist if there is something they can do for you.

6. Tune in to one of the free meetings on this **free online community for a 12 step program called ""In the Rooms""**. Although it's focus is primarily on things such as alcohol, or narcotics, it doesn't matter - it's all about addiction revovery no matter how big or small it is. Check it out: [https://www.intherooms.com/home/live-meetings/](https://www.intherooms.com/home/live-meetings/)

If feel you're missing social support, go there. It's an online support group through webcam meetings & you can share, or just attend and listen anonymously. A 12 step program is for any addiction - you don't have to even do the program yo ucan just listen to others stories.

And of course, excerise and be active if you can. Find something to fill the void and time it takes to recalibrate yourself.

Do something for someone else every day - an act of kindness or making yourself a service to someone else - could be as simple as doing all the dishes, laundry, or even throw the ball for your dog - help other people on here - anything that makes someone elses life a tiny bit better or easier. This alleviates some negative emotions that happen with withdrawal

And that's it! It's only been a week but I'm already feeling so much better & confident in my ability to take control of things in my life.

Be yourself. Eat right. Live right. Your thoughts belong to you. Our body is the greatest and most powerful thing that ever existed. Scientists, doctors, teachers, still cannot conquer the human body and mind. You smoke and destroy this body that you are going to carry around for your whole life. 

Take care of your teeth, your lungs, your weight, your mental health all these are affected by smoking. You are going to age faster than everybody else in every form. Listen to some music until you get out of that zone. If it takes you days or weeks. You come first. Your life is valid. 

Your priority is first. Take the time you need to heal. Watch some movies. Keep your mind in the right place. Nobody is going to hand you a perfect life.
We create the world we want and thats how powerful our mind is.

And yet you let others convince you that you're not good enough and break your spirit. Make you stressed. And humanity's progress becomes slower

Wake up! There are so much to learn to overcome to defeat. We are living in the coming world of robotism and multi-planetary life. There is so much to be a part of and dont allow yourself to be backward.

Sadly, I believe I received the placebo. I'm still smoking.

My counselor from ASU (great person and great facility) has professionally put up with my lies (I am an addict) 

As I write this ... I smoke. 

I tried JUUL 3% regular and that means is 5x stronger; even on a small puff/inhale of what I smoke. Marlboro 72 gold. 

Let me finish with ... I have COPD. If I didnt say it already, I'm 66yo.

I'd seen a few people in my life who did it, and weirdly enough was never put off by the smell - the practice always held a certain kind of romance in my mind.

And in the beginning, it was novel - a sweet reward after a long day of classes, with the nicotine buzz after every hit and the smoke coming off the cigarette turning pretty patterns in the air. I'd smoke when I was bored or when I was waiting outside, before and after classes, whenever. Sure I got sick a few times, but nothing's perfect, right?

Coming home during the pandemic, it turned into a habit out of boredom. It wasn't consistent, but when I did do it I'd go through a 4% vape pod a day, or five cigarettes when I wasn't vaping. Altogether, I'd say I've been a light smoker for about a year.

Coming back to in-person learning and finally being legal, being able to buy a pack or two from the 7-Eleven instead of off some dodgy website, it's been hard to stave off the urge, even if it's expensive. I've gone up to six or more a day, and there's no fun in it anymore. As I write this, I've got a full pack of Camel Blues, plus five more in another pack, which will probably be gone in the next few days. I just want to get off this train before I do some serious damage to my body.

I have an addictive mind that doesn't like changing habits that feel good. 

After many many half-hearted promises to quit smoking I decided to switch over to vaping because it was cheaper and easier to hide/ talk about . I was a little less than a pack a day smoker  and while I dropped my nicotine intake I know that I did the act of vaping way more than I did of smoking and was able to do it and spots I couldn't have smoked before.  

With a birthday approaching and another promise, I limited myself to vaping to when i would have smoked not just whenever I felt like it.  About 5 days before my quit date I ran out of liquid and used some nicotine lozenges.  While I didn't stop nicotine on my b day i can say I am 12 days Nicotine Free and think of myself as a non smoker/nicotine addict. The funny thing is I have super smell after stopping cigarettes and hate the smell of cigs.  Even while vaping the act of smoking seemed so weird and barbaric.

Keep going everyone and dedicate yourselves to stopping.  My way could have failed but it feels so good to be done with that part of me.

Before yesterday, I haven't had a pack since early June. Instead I've been sucking down Juul pods like they were nothing. It worked. I stopped craving the smoke and have been fine without them. But yesterday I decided enough was enough with nicotine. I threw out my Juul, bought a pack, and smoked said pack over the past 24 hours as my ""farewell tour"" to nicotine. 

2 years ago I quit cold turkey and made it a week before I gave in. But that was 100% avoidable, and honestly it really sucked because I had overcome the worst of the cravings. At the time I worked a front-facing job with a bunch of coworkers that smoke. But these days I'm working from home with zero temptation from outside sources. I do have a plan though and it's the same plan I used 2 years ago the last time I quit. I am not showering/brushing teeth/getting ready to leave my house at all until the most intense of cravings subside.

Dear Cigarettes,

Your decades of torment and tyranny on this great nation of ours is coming to a well awaited end. You have plagued us for generations with your promotions of being the new, cool supplement for up-and-coming young adults. Using movie stars of the past and social influencers of the present to promote your products. As you try to hide the cancerous fact of what your product really is doing to us. 

I am not a smoker‚Äîand never have been. I learned that lesson early from repeatedly watching my older relatives fall for your deceitful tricks. 

My uncle Rick was a chain smoker. Every time we played catch or went bike riding, he would stop often for cigarette breaks. He had been smoking since he was 19, getting more serious with it in his older days. Being only nine at the time, I guess I never realized the effects cigarettes were having on him. I just knew they made him smell bad and yellowed the teeth. As I grew older it became clearer to me my uncle‚Äôs dirty habit was doing more behind the scenes. Ten years later my uncle Rick died of lung failure. Back in his day smoking cigarettes was just normal 1 in 3[ Americans](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5129a3.htm) were constant smokers back then. 

For our older generations still here, the problem remains. The life they live is one they are used to and comfortable with. To this day I watch my grandpa of 65 years smoke a pack of cigarettes a day. Against my family and doctors wishes. He says, ‚ÄúIf I'm going to die because of something it‚Äôs going to be something I like doing.‚Äù Cigarette smoking to people like my grandpa is like drinking coffee to non-smokers. 

Thankfully, times have changed. 

My generation isn't so big on smoking traditional cigarettes. No, now we are enticed by the electronic cigarettes or vapes that the smoking companies advertise to be ‚Äúso much healthier for you.‚Äù I see my little brother with these from time to time and can‚Äôt help but scold him. Saying things like ‚Äúdo you want to end up like uncle rick?‚Äù. His reply is always so nonchalant ‚ÄúThey aren‚Äôt even that bad for you relax.‚Äù I find it funny because it‚Äôs the same thing my dad would do to my uncle rick ‚Äî his answers were almost always the same. 

As a nation we are cracking down on this long-standing plague. By doing things like changing the national age to buy cigarettes. Trying to sway our younger generations from falling for the same tricks. With so many people young and old ‚Äî this deceiving foo has stuck with them. My only hope is they can see through the lies before it‚Äôs too late. I am not a smoker, and I make sure the generations after me aren't either. 

Sincerely,

A not smoker",19,0

Had one unsuccessful attempt before, now I've been smoke free for 5 days.

One of my biggest struggles as a non-smoker is being able to relax and take a break.

I have ADHD, and I need my breaks and ""recharge"" to be able to on to the next task, especially in school.

My cigarette break was the perfect way for me to be able to prepare for the next class, I always felt ready and focused when I came back from my break.

But now, I have absolutely no idea how to ""recharge"" without my cigarette.
My non-smoking classmates mostly just sit and scroll through their phone and/or talk with eachother during their breaks.
I love my classmates and we all get along absolutely great, but I feel like I need some change of scenery during my breaks.

I've tried to go out and listen to music during my breaks, just like I did when I was a smoker, but that doesn't help at all.
I've tried talking to my classmates, playing games like tetris or chess, scrolling through social media, talking to friends online, just doing activities that I usually enjoy.
But I still don't feel ready or ""recharged"" when it's time for the next class.

This is mostly a problem in school, but I have this problem in other areas of my life as well.

For example, I've not been able to clean my apartment and I've put off doing basic chores since I stopped smoking.
I can't function without a clean home, and I haven't lack motivation to clean in years.
But now when I can't take my usual breaks by smoking a cigarette, doing basic tasks feels superdifficult.

So, have anyone had similar issues or any advice as to how I can ""recharge"" as a non-smoker?",7,0

Here are some of my big takeaways from watching his videos

1. Nicotine Replacement Therapy is a misnomer when nicotine is involved whether it's vaping, nicotine patches, nicotine gum, etc. If you're using those, it's actually nicotine continuation, you're just changing the method in which you receive it.
2. The difference between a smoker and a non-smoker isn't how long it's been since you've smoked but whether you have a need or desire to smoke. This one hit hard because for me I value the fact that I quit smoking more than the date I quit. I sometimes forget which day I quit, but what matters most is that I quit smoking period. 
3. You should never envy anyone that's smoking, or even vaping for that matter. If you see someone smoking or vaping and you quit, you shouldn't envy that they're ""enjoying"" tobacco or nicotine, but feel bad that they're still addicted as it's a hard habit to kick. It may seem enjoyable from the outside but deep down inside, they're fighting an addiction.",6,0

I made it, and things did change. There are still times when my brain tries to trick me but it‚Äôs so much easier now than from the beginning. So don‚Äôt give up! 

There are a lot of emotions you‚Äôre going to feel while you quit and one emotion is boredom that can‚Äôt be relieved by anything so it‚Äôs important to stay productive and try to do things where you accomplish something even if it‚Äôs just house work. 

Remember, cigarettes robbed us of our ‚Äònatural‚Äô dopamine. Lighting a cigarette? Lights up a whole part of your brain, something that not even a video game or tv could do. Even the thought of a smoke excites your brain. So now we need to reprogram and cut ties with those transmitters.

Day 10 I had fewer panic attacks and on day 11 I only had 1. During these attacks I was obsessing over my breathing which caused me to manually breath for 3 days straight. I obsessed over many other things as-well once I forgot about the manual breathing, its almost like I‚Äôm trading obsessions for new obsessions once I forget about them.The anxiety dissipated over the next couple days but I still had that lingering feeling of uneasiness and anxiety.

The first 3-4 days are usually mentally miserable for me. I have always been a sensitive person, and the withdrawals just heighten it all. There is always crying. Always. Sometimes there is agitation. It depends on who I am around or if I get a call from my parents (that‚Äôs a trigger). By day 5, I‚Äôve usually hit a stride and have a lot more energy. Then it‚Äôs all a game of ‚ÄúCigarettes are my comfort and I am uncomfortable‚Äù.

1. log every cigarette I took and record what triggers me to smoke that and at which time I smoke, I did that for 1 week 
2. after that I used to set a daily achievable goal to smoke this much cigarettes only - this help me set a boundary and help my mind to stay alert whenever I smoke 
3. after that I decided I will not smoke any cigarette if I don't feel like it (choose least trigger when I don't want to smoke but still smokes) and reduced, and whenever I get the trigger which I target not to smoke I used to distract my mind to do something else - like dancing, singing out loud, drinking as much water as I can

and after 2 week of exercise I reduced my cigarette to 1-2 a day and now I don't crave for cigarette  

so this is what I realise when practicing this  

1. awareness and being truthful to yourself and acceptance is important that creates awareness about your habit and your mind can be more proactive about those alerts
2. Observation of your habit is also very important when you know what's going and analyse it that helps your mind to reason about it.
3.  break your smoking pattern by applying some coping mechanism (for me it was singing, dancing, hold breath, counting breath etc)

I started vaping as a quitting aid about two weeks ago and I am slowly cutting down the strength.

Today, I have been sneezing and coughing up tar. I am extremely tired, there is a fog in my brain and I have a headache. My mouth and lips are also sore. It is to the point that I'm not sure if this is purely withdrawals or a headcold as well. I was meant to be going out this evening but I fee like death. 

I have done a covid test, which was negative btw. 

Because I'm replacing the nicotine, I thought that the withdrawal symptoms would be less but at the same time, I would think that my body is probably clearing out other toxins from smoking for 7 years. So I'm not sure what to think. 

Is this to be expected?",3,1

Yeah, but look at how much we achieved so far!!","So this is more of a reflection. After an extremely hard week in which I was finally letting go of NRT and managed to be completely nicotine free for a while, I caved and smoked. One cigarette on Friday, two on Saturday and some vaping and one on Sunday. I was feeling pretty bad and wondering if all the progress of the last 34 days (according to the app) was worthless. I had previously caved once on week 2, but I carried on. This time I was seriously worried I might not make it.

Then I started thinking. In 34 days, I smoked a total of 6 cigarettes. Not even a pack. Obviously, I would prefer to have been totally smoke-free. But when was the last time my smoking was this low? I believe it was when I was 15 years old, and I am now 27.

During those 34 days, I struggled with depression, stress at work, a major fight with my boyfriend and family issues. And still, only 6 cigarrettes.

6 cigarettes is what I used to smoke in a morning.

So now I am carrying on, back on NRT because its safer for the time being. But I just wanted to leave this message for everyone out there who might be struggling with relapse - don't focus on the past which you can't control, but on the future, and be proud that your willpower took you this far already.

I'm starting to realize that quitting smoking really is a journey and there will be mistakes, but as long as I don't let it get me down, I will be fine.",31,0

Fast forward to now and I'm a month sober from weed which is huge for me, I want to now quit smoking tobacco again but I've pretty much pushed the stuff from Allen Carr's book to the back of my mind so I'm going to re read it.

Do you suggest I read from the beginning again or is there a suggested chapter for anyone reading it for the second time?

Apart from the common things we hear about the benefits of quitting, a big part of why I decided was because I finally accepted that nicotine is an addiction and for someone who used to be addicted to harder things, I needed to do this to gain back control of the thing that has taken control of my livelihood. And another reason is really because of my little doggo. I really want him to live a long and healthy life and I wanna eliminate the things that could potentially shorten his life.

Not the right mix for battling an addiction like nicotine. Yet, with a lot of support from an online community kind of like this one, I was able to kick the habit once and for all. 

For all those in the early days of your quit, I believe in you. You can do it.",219,0

At about an average of about 10 a day, that is 25,000 cigarettes not smoked.

At an average of about $10 / pack, that is $12,500 not spent.

I finally quit after reading about Allan Carr's Easyway book here on r/stopsmoking. That book helped me think differently about my reasons for wanting to smoke. Once I was able to short-circuit those desires quitting was much more successful.

It was not my first time trying to quit. So if you've tried in the past, but failed - fear not! It usually takes a few attempts. Don't get down on yourself or think it is hopeless. My greatest failing was always thinking I could have 'just one.' Months of hard work would, literally, go up in a puff of smoke.

I admire all of you here taking those necessary steps to a smoke-free life. Keep at it. You can do it. And before you know it you'll be back here on r/stopsmoking offering encouragement and support to those thinking about it or taking those first few steps.",35,0

Its been one year since I last smoked a cigarette :D,"I've thought about this day for years. Seems like a good occasion for self-indulgent reflection on my experience, why it took so long, and what helped.

I'm one of those people who ""tried to quit"" a thousand times over the past ... 15 years?? It all seems so insane to me now - going that long desperately wanting to stop smoking, spending so much time mentally and physically suffering. If you're one of those people who have tried to quit too many times to count, but still find yourself smoking - take me as an example that it IS possible to free yourself from the addiction. Don't ever stop trying.

When I think back to the things that made it hard to quit, some that stick out are: 

\- Hormonal fluctuations. As a woman with pretty intense PMS, I'd go on a health kick and feel powerful and on top of the world for about two and a half weeks during which quitting smoking would feel natural and easy. Then after ovulation my hormone levels would tank and I'd lose steam. Then PMS would hit and I'd feel like a chaotic, over-whelmed mess, give up, and go back to smoking. I'd recover from the chaos during my period (though still feeling drained physically), then a few days after my period I'd be back to a daily gym routine, quit smoking, and feel like ""THIS time I've got it"". I repeated that cycle literally every months for years.

\- Alcohol, caffeine, and other drugs. Every weekend, I was living on a rollercoaster of stimulants and depressants. When drinking, there was always a point in the evening when a switch flipped in my brain and all of a sudden the goal was to smoke as many cigarettes as possible. ""Party drugs"" like cocaine and mdma (of which I was only an occasional user, but still) had the same effect, but hugely amplified. I felt like I could eat cigarettes when I was high. Even caffeine, which put me in a good mood, would also make me over-stimulated / anxious in a way that made me want to smoke. 

\- General life-dissatisfaction and a lack of self-awareness. There were a lot of things I just didn't understand about my own psychology that made it hard for me to make good decisions for my health and well-being. I didn't like where I was in life and I didn't feel good, but didn't really understand why and wasn't doing much to figure it out. Instead, I was trying to band-aid over the issues with hedonism and distraction.

\- Dating someone who smoked. We'd try to quit together, but in doing so we just doubled of our chances for failure - if one person gave in, the other did, too

Okay, on to the things that helped:

\- Developing a ""toolkit"" of defence tactics to use when faced with triggers (nicotine cravings in the first few days / weeks and occasional ""nicotine nostalgia"" as I like to call it during the first few months). This toolkit included some motivating phrases I had saved in my phone (e.g. ""Everyone who smokes deep down wants to quit. No one who quits ever regrets doing so""). There were a few key memories I'd think back to (e.g. I remember seeing someone outside of a bar late at night looking longingly at people smoking. I offered her one and I saw her take a long look at it then she said ""no, I can't go back to smoking"" and it just struck me as a powerful moment and I thought ""yes - that's what I need to learn how to do""). Then there was the tried and true method of ""just go home and go to bed"" if I felt like I couldn't stay in the environment I was in without smoking.

\- Learning to track the symptoms of my hormone fluctuations. Once I could actually predict what I would feel and when and why, I was MUCH better at coping. I also found some supplements that have helped with the symptoms (e.g. vitamin B6, magnesium, and anti-histamines).

\- Sorting out my life dissatisfaction and mental health. I went to therapy, started journalling, got out of a romantic relationship that wasn't working for me, moved, changed jobs, got really into learning about psychology through podcasts and books. This was all over a few years. It helped so much to make some progress on figuring myself out, learning what I need to have a good life, and actively making those things happen for myself.

\- Getting free from other addictions. This time around I actually stopped smoking before I stopped drinking, but I had also had a few trial runs of sobriety (6 - 8 month stretches) not long before that. I knew that not drinking made it easier to stick to the decision to not smoke, but the main reasons I quit drinking were the myriad of other benefits (shoutout to /r/stopdrinking). I didn't make a conscious effort to quit party drugs as I had only been an occasional user. They just kind of naturally stopped being part of my lifestyle. Giving up caffeine was a hard one, but ultimately made me a much more calm and level person. Being free from the ups and downs of addiction life-style helped me fully understand that doing whatever I need to to stay free from addictions (including not giving in to smoking cravings or smoking nostalgia) are extremely important to me. Freedom from addictions is life on easy mode!

\- Getting physically healthy. I discovered along the way that I'm a person who needs to move to feel good. It helps as a motivator to quit smoking (for lung performance) and decreases the anxiety that pushed me to smoke, it makes me sleep so much better, improves my mental health, makes my skin and body look great, increases my energy through the day. Just all around life improvement. I do Essentrics exercise videos, run, cycle, dance, and occasionally do yoga and other activities.

\- Allen Carr's book helped me at one point, but I found the effects wore off as soon as I gave in the first time after it helped me quit for a few months. It was like the spell was broken and I couldn't really get the magic back. Still a helpful insight into the workings of addiction though.

Okay, time to get on with the rest of my day. I wish you all the best and hope some of this has resonated with or inspired some of you!",223,0

Here are some tips (sorry for the long post),"In the beginning, I remember how far away being smoke-free for 6 months seemed to me. Here I am! I am looking forward to being smoke-free for a year.

What was most helpful for me during this process were  Quitsure app and this forum. Quitsure app helped me to understand this addiction and why I have those beliefs about smoking. And this group was always there for me when I needed help, when I struggled. It was nice to know I wasn‚Äôt alone, there were others struggling just like me, but also people who were smoke-free for years and they were actually pretty happy with it! As smokers, we don‚Äôt hear from these people enough. Most ex-smokers we know are complaining about it‚Ä¶ They still want to have that cigarette etc. (I think this is because they quit with the wrong mindset and without having an understanding of this addiction). It was nice to see that being a nonsmoker and actually enjoying it was possible!!

I am aware that in this group, there are many other non-smokers who are much experienced than me.  But I still want to share my experiences, in case it can be helpful to others. I failed many times in this quitting smoking so many times before, this last one was the 1 millionth attempt. But I can see this time is different!

* 1st step: Use quitsure app and educate yourself on why you are addicted. It is important to understand why you smoke, and the nature of the physical and psychological addiction. And definitely do mindful smoking as the app says. It was the most useful thing for me! But I found the app too dogmatic in certain parts‚Ä¶ It says that you should feel and think in a certain way after completing the program. I don‚Äôt agree with that! Everyone is different and this is a hard addiction to quit. You might be afraid to quit and that‚Äôs ok! It is like breaking up with a toxic significant other who was there for a long time. It might not be easy (depending on how addicted you are of course). Also, I don't agree with the app about not rewarding yourself, not replacing it with anything. You don‚Äôt need to be superhuman to stop smoking! For me, the basic rule was not a puff. And don‚Äôt replace it with bad things. But I replaced it with running and I think it is an excellent replacement (can‚Äôt run if you smoke). And I had no experience with running. I used this app 5K runner. If you are like me, give it a try ;) And I snacked, so what? Okay, it is better if you can do it without snacking but the most important thing is you don‚Äôt smoke. Now I feel much better and can deal with the extra pounds I got. It is not the end of the world. And reward yourself with the money you gained from not smoking. Feels great to buy things you wouldn‚Äôt buy if you were still smoking. 
* The first 5 days are the hardest (especially 3-4). I needed support. So, a friend of mine came over for supporting me. She was there for me from my second day till the 5th. In the meantime, we did a lot of sightseeing. We were out all the time. Wandering around, having fun. This distraction helped me to pass the first 5 days which are critical for the physical addiction.
* Let people know you quit. Especially, people, you feel responsible for. I told my supervisors that I quit, it gave me a feeling of responsibility, I would be ashamed to tell them I am smoking again. Also, you might be an annoying person in the first week, warn people around you about this if needed :)
* Although nicotine is out of your body (and many resources tell the physical addiction is gone after 5 days and it is psychological addiction after) that‚Äôs not true!! Smoking impairs the dopamine system of the brain. So you might feel anhedonia in the first month. It was the case for me and understanding it helped me a lot. I knew I needed to wait until my brain heals. And instead of ‚Äúsolving‚Äù this with smoking, I got angrier about smoking! It even harmed the functioning of my brain!
* One of the things that were most helpful for me was, thinking about how I would feel if I smoked at the moment. Mindful smoking exercise in quitsure app was very helpful for this. I just realized I would just feel worse! Shortness of breath, bad taste, nausea, increased heartbeat‚Ä¶ 
* I focused on my gains from not smoking, instead of complaining about the symptoms of not smoking.
* In the beginning, I stayed away from smoker friends. But then, I exposed myself. You need to have the same experiences with your friends, this time without smoking. This is how habits change. Do the same things, one difference: no cigarettes. You get used to it in time and you enjoy these even more than before, don't worry those times will come. 
* One puff is enough to get back to your addiction. This is the most important rule!!!! You shouldn‚Äôt get nicotine in your body. No cigars, weed with tobacco, or whatever that is that contains tobacco/nicotine.
* When I had the cravings, I reminded myself, I would prefer craving for 3 times a day rather than 20 times every day (yep that is what happens when you keep smoking). And it gets less and less. Now I maybe have a craving 2 times a month.
* The worst times are probably stressed or sad times. In those times, try not to be with smokers. Get support from somebody who doesn‚Äôt smoke. 
* Smoking is more than just inhaling that smoke. You suppress your emotions and fill the void in your life. So when it is out of your life, it is challenging psychologically. You need to learn to deal with life IN A HEALTHY WAY! That‚Äôs hard at the beginning but you will get the advantage of this in time!!!

Now I love being a non-smoker. I AM FREE!! You don‚Äôt realize it that much but you give so much effort in your life just to be able to smoke. Getting relief from that is amazing! Spending your days without thinking about smoking is amazing! Being able to concentrate on your work for hours is amazing (this is a struggle at the beginning but be patient, it will be so good). Sitting inside in cold weather without being stressed about smoking is amazing! So many benefits, if I write them, this already long post would get huge. 

I have one last note for the heavy smokers: At the time I stopped, I was smoking more than a pack a day. My lungs were hurting. I was heavily addicted. That made this journey very hard, especially the first month. I suffered from brain fog, depression. But because it was so hard, I am stronger now! I know what I have been through and I don‚Äôt want to go through that experience again. I don‚Äôt want to throw away all the suffering I experienced by becoming an addict again. So while you will pay a higher cost as a heavy smoker, you will also know better the worth of being a nonsmoker! Therefore, do not let this discourage you! If I could do it, you can also do it! You should just need to make the decision to quit, be ready to face whatever challenges this process brings you; but also be ready to embrace all the amazing experiences you will get after, and the growth you will have as a person. Be ready for becoming advanced you :)",101,0

I am almost 2 days clean , cold turkey , after 25 yrs, pack a day in the end. Every morning I would have a few coffee s and a few cigarettes in the past, straight out of bed, in boxers.  Mornings are tough.  I go for brief walks early since I now wake up 2 hours earlier. I stay in a non flat suburb. By the time I get back my lungs hurt like crazy from traversing the hills.  Okay I am super unfit. This will keep triggers away till mid morning. 

I am also taking an antidepressant, called wellbutrin. This appearantley helps with smoke citation. I do wake up in the middle of the night,  completely soaken and have a lot of nightmares, since taking wellbutrin. I am ging to skip that tonight and take it in the morning. 
Not sure if anyone experiences  this?

My only real trigger is when I get overhelmed with work.  This could be one phone call, but it makes me want to go outside and light up. Which was my escape mechanism. For only these short two days I am more productive  working but I also takes breaks  just to calm down,  usually about 1 to 2 hrs break/sleep.

I'm still working from home.  I actually spend more time with the kids now I don't smel like am ashtray.  I always was extremely emberased smelling like smoke. With anyone who was a non smoker.

Some sense of smell is coming back,  waking past schrubs with flowers

Its tough.  I am 50(m) and cried my eyes out just like that.  So i suspect going through a nasty low  with less nicotine and caffeine.

I regret smoking.  I started getting chest pains. Now these have dropped significantly. My veins felt like they where all pumped up. Not a nice feelings.

I am doing this for me and my teenage kids. I would like to be around them still in 20√∑ years.

I save enough money, not buying 6 to 7 packs a week, to take my kids for a decent breakfast out , once  every weekend.  

I have tried many occasions,  it takes a little bit of time.

Here are the rules:

1. After 'using' nicotine -- one cigarette worth-- I must record the amount of minutes since the last time I used.
2. The next time I use nicotine must occur at minimum 1 minute later than the last abstinence period.
3. Sleep doesn't count or I'd go insane jumping up to 8 hour waits.

(tw: it had to do with a suicide attempt). i realized that addiction played a huge role in it, but at some point i made a joke about how ""at least i'll always have nicotine and caffeine. it's legal!""

my therapist didn't really laugh, and she asked the question, ""well, what if that means you're not really over the causes of your addiction?""

and it got me thinking. now that i am 34 days nicotine free, (and 41 days sober from alcohol/101 days sober from drugs) i realize... she was right. smoking is so normalized, especially from an addict perspective, but that doesn't mean it's any better/worse than any other form of addiction. i was using it as a crutch. and when i gave up smoking, i started using food as a crutch, too.

but i'm solid now. and i don't want to relapse anytime soon, regardless of the vice. i feel so much more confident and comfortable with myself now that i am living without any substance or habits to rely on. i have always hated myself, but for the first time in my life, i am genuinely proud of my accomplishments because i know that i achieved them all on my own. 

quitting smoking was so much more empowering than i thought it would ever be. i had to face my anxiety head on. i had to actively find better, healthier coping mechanisms instead of passing them from one bad behavior to the other. i have no more excuses now, and have to listen to my body when it tells me something is wrong. and other people, like doctors, can take it seriously too because they can't just write it off to smoking (or anything else for that matter). life throws enough curveballs at us, don't let this add another.",71,0

I lurked this subreddit for quite some time now and decided to write. I have smoked in the past for 5 years (almost 1 pack a day) and decided to quit at some point. It took me a few tries until I read Allen Carr's book and finally did it. The last time was quite easy and exciting. And I quit for 6 years. The best part is that I considered myself a non-smoker because after a while I didn't crave cigarettes at all. For me, cigarettes were like some cucumber being eaten: I didn't acknowledge when someone lit a cigarette and felt nothing for it , no craving and no displeasure. I was indifferent to them.

But after 6 years I started to smoke socially and for fun: a cigarette now, a cigarette after a month, a cigarette after a week. I didn't acutally smoke it, just puffed it in my mouth, not lungs. And I didn't pay any attentiont to it, stil indifferent. The problem is that I started to smoke more and for fun and still didn't see a problem with it. I would quit for a few days, sometimes a few weeks and never smoked a lot. During these pauses I still smoked weed though (again, not much, but constant). But I kept this habit for a year and I kept telling myself that I was still a non-smoker and that I smoke just for fun. 

Until I couldn't lie to myself. Everytime I took a pause from smoking I was eager to smoke again. And I noticed that I was deceiving myself and that I am a smoker again.

This month was my birthday and I said that it was enough. I quit again and for 4 weeks I am smoke free. The problem is that it's harder for me now than in the first days, because in the last year I was never nicotine free for this long. And I find myself making excuses to light a cigarette again. And for the past week i'm feeling really miserable. On one hand I know I will feel awful to smoke again, on the other hand I feel awful without cigarettes. It's like a lose-lose situation.

My reasoning for smoking again is that next year I will move in a different country and I'm thinking that I can leave the quitting part for then and start a new life. But I know I will be dissapointed in myself and feeling like a failure if I actually lit a cigarette up. 

I see all these posts of other people feeling so happy at 4 weeks but I'm actually really miserable and find that I cannot relate to anybody",8,0

When college ended, I stopped using drugs.  I don't miss the cocaine i snorted back in 1994 when I was 20 y/o.

I don't even miss marijuana.  I got drunk a great deal in college, of  course, but once college ended I stopped drinking to excess.  

Yet the cigarettes are so much harder.

I even tried Opium a few times. Never got hooked.

And yet every time I quit smoking my body just screams.

I don't feel sick for cocaine.  I don't have DT's for marijuana although when I smoked cannabis daily back in the 90's it was certainly a habit.

I've been smoking on a regular basis since I was 21.  I come from a long line of smokers.  My mom smokes, so did my grandma and great grandma.  When I was 5 my mom made me smoke a ciggarette thinking the experience would traumatize me to the point of not wanting to ever pick up the habit, but of course now I'm the only one of my sisters who smoke (I'm the oldest of 5).  

I did a lot of social smoking before the age of 21 but didn't really become truly addicted until I joined the USMC.  There was a pretty strong smoking culture and it was a way to get breaks during 12 hour days.  As time went on I started smoking more.  Half a pack a day went to 3 or 4 packs.  Thankfully it went back down to a pack a day when I moved into a smoke free apartment complex but then I started staying up late at night just so I could go down and smoke and not bother anyone (I live in a busy part of town).  I am self employed and work from home so I could get away with it.  The thing is though I suffer from social anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder and depression.  I also suspect I have undiagnosed inattentive ADHD.  Being a smoker with ADHD is especially painful, and every time I try to quit I completely lose what little focus I have because I reward myself with a ciggarette when I do productive things.  Every time I try to quit I get extremely depressed, but I am at the point where its starting to affect my health.  My circulation issues are getting worse and I'm having bad back pain.  My mom who still smokes is pretty close to being in a wheel chair due to her back issues and I don't want to end up like her.  I can handle the physical effects of withdrawal but the few times I've tried to quit I dealt with pretty bad brain fog on top of my depression issues.  I'm just hoping someone out there might have some advice or even just encouragement for me.

I started quitting last year in April due to COVID and had my last slip up in December 2020. I might have used disposable vapes here and there until I decided I was fully done with them as I realized they were triggering anxiety and a waste of money for the most part.

Anyways, despite taking care of myself more via exercise and staying on top of my hygiene, I ended up having an abscess tooth with severe pain the other day. Fortunately I only had to do a root canal instead of getting the tooth extracted as it's one of my front teeth. Either way, this shit is VERY painful and would not wish it on anyone. I'm currently on antibiotics. It freaked me out because I asked my dentist if it was anything from my doing or hygiene methods and he said it was out of my control and the abscess was there for years but didn't give me pain till now. I'm starting to think that since I was most likely a smoker when this started, that while it may not have been the sole cause of it, it definitely didn't help.

There have also been times when I'd go see the dentist and my hygienist would ask if I was smoking due to stains on my teeth and receding gums. Some people act like smoking only affects your lungs, but it can do damage to literally every other body part. While I am happy I quit, this makes me happier to stay quit and regret that I ever started smoking, let alone starting after I already quit for a few years.

Bottom line is your teeth and health are super precious. I would almost make two analogies for smoking. Smoking is the perfect analogy for fuck around and find out. It's no secret that smoking causes many different health issues so if you fuck around long enough (by smoking), you will definitely find out (the health issues). Another is Russian roulette but with your health. By smoking cigarettes you are risking so many different health issues, that you definitely don't want. And there's no certainty of which one you will get and when it will start. Some of those people in the tips from former smoker videos got health issues as early as their late teens (which are rare) as well as their mid to late 30s/early 40s. Like I said, while it's bad enough that I got an abscess tooth at 31 after quitting, I can't imagine how worse it'd be if I was still smoking. I can't emphasize this enough. Like the whole idea of ""I can just wait until I'm a certain age to quit"" needs to end. Quit now! ",11,1

I immediately called my dentist and scheduled a filling replacement for yesterday. From Thursday to Sunday, I just felt sensitivity here and there but was fine otherwise. Just nursed my open filling until I came in. Then Monday morning I started feeling intense tooth and jaw pain. I called my dentist worried about it getting really bad and infected so they prescribed me antibiotics. 

My tooth and jaw was hurting REALLY bad and then yesterday when I finally got to the dentist, they took x-rays and found an even bigger problem. Turns out I had an abscess tooth in my front bottom left tooth but the pain was felt in my jaw and other teeth. Fortunately they don't have to extract it and just did a root canal, which relieved the pain as they drained all the pus. I asked my dentist if this happened from bad oral hygiene even though I brush twice a day and floss along with using mouth rinse. 

He said there was nothing I could have done and it's out of my control. But I'm thinking all those years of smoking, even though I quit last year, and occasional vaping might have been a contributing factor, even if they weren't a sole factor. I mean I never told my dentist that I smoked or vaped as I hid it from my family. And here's the thing. Even though it's been over a year since I quit, I would still buy vapes here and there or ask my friend for a few puffs. While vaping may not be as dangerous as cigarettes, it's still not good for you. I didn't vape all the time but the times I'd buy them, it'd be those cheap disposable vapes ranging from $8-20. Most of them have been pulled from the gas stations that sell them, probably for the best.

Im 20 yo right now and smoked for 4 years. I had 2 attempt, all of them lastet 1 weeks. 

I failed in my first attempt because someone forgot his pack in class, our teacher asked us, if it belongs to someone. Nobody answered and i said, that i can take it, if its unclaimed, than i took it :)

Second attempt failed, because i went to a Cafe with my smoker friend.  I was able to control myself. I didnt want any cigs. Anyways, my friend went to WC and left his burning cig on the ashtray. I looked at it, it was charming. I thought, that i can handle 1 puff, its as easy as pie. I took a smoke... After half an hour i lit a cigarette :(

Now, i haven't smoke cigs for 5 days and now i can feel, that i can get rid of it forever! Today i didnt felt the 'craving' first time in 3 years. I didnt believed myself to get rid of it but right now im sure that i can handle it, without any 'puffs'.",6,0

I need to be done.,"Update: Finished 24 hours! Doesn‚Äôt all of the CO come out of the bloodstream by then? Woohoo!! Feeling great!

TLDR: I hate I started smoking. I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôll be posting daily for accountability purposes. Here‚Äôs for Day One. Remember to breathe. 

I‚Äôve been here, time and time again. I know the risks of smoking. I know the addiction. I‚Äôve smoked for quite some time. But I‚Äôm nervous. Here‚Äôs my story.

When I was 18, I moved in with my SO. I was still in high school, but I needed to escape my family. Constant threats from a homophobic step-father, always reminded I‚Äôm about to be kicked out and to not come home. I couldn‚Äôt take it. I left the day after my 18th birthday. My life continued to be challenging, but in new ways. But I thought I was in love. Then, my SO passed away. It tore me apart. How could I not know he was addicted to drugs? Was I that naive? I move back home and surrounded myself by those who actually loved me.

My mother was one of those people. She is a chain smoker. I picked up on the habit. What was I thinking? I hate that I did it. Now, 13 years later, I smoke way too much. I need this to end. My energy is low, my breathing is terrible, my happiness is out of reach. I quit previously for a year and a half. I know I can do it. But I‚Äôm still scared.

So my last cigarette was yesterday at 4:00 pm. I‚Äôm doing mostly well. I haven‚Äôt smoked. I‚Äôve stayed busy. But I know the next couple of days will be tough. I can do it.

Thank you for listening. I needed to get some of this out. I‚Äôm committing to posting daily. I need accountability.

If anyone needs to work with someone to get this kicked to the curb, please feel free to reach out.
