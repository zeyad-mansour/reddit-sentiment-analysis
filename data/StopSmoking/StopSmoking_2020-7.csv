However I developed a bad habit especially during lockdown as I'm in my house all the time I like to go out a few times per day or moreso at night and stand in the street and smoke a fag. Maybe half a fag. Perhaps do this 2 or 4 times per night so only smoke 1 or 2 at most and not every day.

But it's not even the smoke it's just to go outside and get a break from sitting in my house.

I dont wanna go a full on walk just need a short change of scenery.

First time trying it was on my buddies Smok Badge, 50 mg worth of nicotine, to say the least it put me on my ass and i loved it as before hand i had smoked weed for a few years before.

Either way, this got me started on it and before long it got to the point where i didn't car whether i was in the store or in bed, i was still hitting it and i honestly am ashamed i let it get this far. As a child i always use to tell my mom it can't be that hard but now that i'm experiencing this for myself i have to admit i was very very wrong and also have to applaud her for going cold turkey a few years ago and staying that way.

So now it's my turn, i have a bad habit of just putting the devices away somewhere where i end up caving in a few hours later or the next morning without it. So, this time i tossed it out the window going like 80 down a backroad (yes I'm sorry for littering but this guarantees i can't just dig it out of the trash later that night in my house or something.)

Anyways, i've been about 24 hours without any nicotine and my eyes are very heavy and unfocused, yet they feel strained and like i can't seem to break the feeling that my blood vessels are showing. It's a very odd feeling similar to being high from weed and feeling that your eyes are bloodshot.. If anything it messes with my vision because i attempt to rub my eyes to get rid of the ""feeling"" of it.

Also having slightly hard chest pains here and there whenever the peak of an urge comes. Feels like my lungs are doing worse without the nicotine, which is obviously false.

I guess moral of the story is those ads you see where nicotine ""rewires your brain"" couldn't be any more true... in no other circumstance has my body ever reacted to something like this or similar feeling.

It truly rewirse it in the way that i'm quite literally fighting myself and arguing with my conscience in my head saying over and over ""don't let it do this to you,  don't let it f***** do this to you"" because the withdrawal has such a gripping power on self-control you must mentally be seriously prepared to do something like this and shake the habit.

I hope to continue my (so far 24-hour) nicotine quit. Wish me luck because our parents weren't kidding when we didn't understand how difficult it is to drop this.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6362698}"

I'm a graduate student from the United States, and my fieldwork often takes me overseas. Right now, I'm working on a small, personal project in Mexico to retain a grant. This is the first time I've been abroad since March, when the coronavirus pandemic began flaring up in the Americas.

I started socially smoking when I was 19, in Turkey.  But the habit didn't follow me home. However, the next year, I hitchhiked across Europe--while crossing Croatia, a local guy gave me a pack of cigarettes to help kill time along the roadside. I started smoking regularly after that, and I've built up this pretty deep association of ""overseas"" and ""cigarettes.""

Over the course of the past couple years, I've managed to *mostly* stop smoking whenever I'm home in the U.S.--occasionally I'll light up when I'm drunk, but I don't otherwise touch cigarettes, or get unmanageable cravings.

But I've always smoked when I traveled. Part of the problem is that I tend to visit lower-income countries, where loose cigarettes are cheap and widely available. Public smoking is also a lot more common in countries like Mexico and India than it is in the United States.

One way or another, smoking is usually one of the first things on my mind after I get off the plane.

Last night was my first night here in Mexico. I'm staying alone, because of COVID, and ordered myself a celebratory drink--and of course I wound up smoking, too. Then, this morning, I smoked another few cigarettes before breaking the packet.

I really don't want to go back down the rabbit hole--I've made a lot of healthy changes lately. I lost 10 lbs in the last month, cut down my drinking a lot, only go for diet sodas, etc. And the nice thing about Mexico, compared to where I was living before, is that it's a ***lot*** easier to go on long walks.

Guess I'm just looking for some moral support. I know it's all in my head, and I know I need to knock smoking while drinking, too. But this fucking craving I get for cigarettes whenever I'm abroad just wrecks me, time and time again.

No coffee or cig ever triggered me. I used to go to the bathroom like 2-3 times a week on average. My diet was regularly healthy but have often dieted a bit which slowed down my metabolism even more. I have recently decided to drop the weight I put on as a consequence of quitting (not much, like 10 pounds) and started an intermittent fasting and running (like every year after holiday season) but this time I have noticed my bowl movements occurring almost every day despite the much lower food intake.

Often when I dream of smoking, I am already doing it and then I will realize in the dream that I am and then get mad at myself for caving because I will remember in the dream that I had quit.

Like so many of you I tried to quit cold turkey about a year ago, and then fell into the trap of starting again half a year later because 'What's the harm. One won't get my hooked again, right? '

  
I talked to my doctor about how much I \*hate\* being a smoker. From the increasing price tag to how it makes me tired and anxious all the time because I keep looking for places to have a quick smoke. I found out that she also used to be a smoker (which was nice because it felt there was some compassion and understanding from her side about the whole issue) and recommended something to me called Champix (which she also used). 

They're basically pills that suppress the constant desire for nicotine and also make cigarettes taste really weird and make you feel nauseous when smoking. I'm currently on day 10 (you slowly increase your dosage). I used to smoke a pack a day. Yesterday I only smoked four and only managed to finish halfway because of how ill it made me feel. Today I haven't smoked any yet and so far I haven't had any desire at all to smoke.

I think the best thing about it is that the pills don't replace the nicotine, but rather suppress the need for it. That way you can really get rid of the nicotine addiction rather than maintinging it by using patches or gum.

I (34m) realize this is cowardly, and want to prepare y'all: this is a post from someone trying to figure shit out. Posting because I relapsed tonight, and I'm honestly unsure if I ever should/could/will live without nicotine in a functional manner.  I've used nicotine for 20 years off/on, and at this point, I don't know what to think.

I quit smoking two weeks ago, cold turkey, a mix of cog-behavioral with sheer willpower. I've quit before and been successful for years. In the past, I've done NRT in the form of patches and been OK, but even after years of being nic-free, my partner said, ""If you want to start smoking again, I'd be OK with that."" I'll submit that this is fucked up, and maybe terrible, but I am now thinking she was right. I am substantially more forgiving, more creative, and more ""who I want to be"" with nicotine in my system. I'm not talking about 2-6 months nic-free...I mean years without smoking. When we split up, she mentioned it again, saying that after 3 years of being together, it still felt like I was a better partner when I had nicotine. This hurt me, and I quit for several years, then started up again.

When I started up again, it was alongside a resumption of alcohol abuse (like many others). Friends moved in with me, things went sideways. My BFF was ingesting 50+ drinks each day and I was coaching her bf through trying to help her. She ended up owing me thousands, I evicted her after she was operating power tools (reciprocating, chain, and All The Other saws) while extraordinarily hammered. In terms of consumption--the curbside giant/rolling bins (US) would be filled within 4 days every week. I have never, ever seen any individual as committed to self-destruction as this. I had to evict her because we were doing home reno together, and I couldn't be around her all the time to make sure that if she had access to a reciprocating saw that she'd still have access to her arms, legs, head, etc. It was an extremely tough time.

A few months later, after several demotions/re-orgs at work due to investor craziness, I met a wonderful woman from another country. Things went swell. A few weeks later in late 2018, I hooked up with someone (gray area, but I was in the wrong) and shit went sideways. I felt bad, got self-absorbed, and did some laundry. Little did I know that my BFF (my cat, who had breast cancer) was cold--she climbed in my clothes dryer, I turned it on without checking in my shame/hungover haze, and she died in the dryer. I buried her the day after I found out my entire company was laid off.  


This belies how horribly destructive this time was. Suffice it to say: I had a total mental/emotional breakdown.  


Other shit happened and life got dark/weird, and throughout I wanted to quit smoking, but felt like I was not in a place where I could compartmentalize quitting. In summer 2018, I picked up vaping and ""quit smoking"" for mostly forever.  


I took a corporate job and stealth-vaped for the next 18 months, adding to feelings of shame, self-involvement, and general fucked-up-ness. Like anyone with a stupid addiction, I made mistakes, excuses, limitations, and buried my addiction as a ""necessary evil"" to my success.  


This is sort of where the bullshit comes in, or tbh, continues: I am extremely high-functioning. I work for large corporations, I do strategy consulting, and I have a ridiculous pedigree/performance background that is anti-usual for ""smokers,"" at least as far as my teammates are concerned. I mention this here because it contextualizes ""high performance addict"" in a way that is both shameful and inspiring. Oftentimes I feel like addicts get the raw end of the deal, and the truth is that you can be wonderful and addicted, and you should strive to be wonderful for LONGER, and your addiction impedes that success. Break free, if you can, and help others when you can.   


In this time, I discovered that you can vape in-cabin within most large planes, provided you are humble. You can vape fiendishly in bathrooms if you so choose, with pens or tanks or whatever else. If you're a nicotine-hound, this makes you feel liberated and rebellious and vindicated, just like those bastards you hated in 2015 who blew clouds whilst buying frozen goods in your local supermarket. There was a guilty invincibility that I felt, like a Superman who was aware that no villains could observe a cogent argument against my success.  


During this time, I exercised my influence as an indispensable software architect for a Company You've Heard Of and vaped without reserve. I also happen to suffer from other disorders that cause me to visit the bathroom at an unnatural rate, and I developed methods of filtering vapor, or patching nicotine, or finding loopholes anywhere I could.  


Is nicotine ≈ heroin? No. Does it create social acceptance opportunities/etc that increase its addictive nature to the point where it cannot be adequately refused? Yes.  


Oh, it's so long-winded, but here we are.  


I've quit several times. I've failed every time.  


I'm not the most attractive/awesome/interesting guy ever, but I do well. In ""Strengths Finder,"" my #1 skill is ""gaining influence."" I can't help it--it's who I am. I tend to go through long dry spells, then rainy seasons, and right now I'm in an ""occasional thunderstorm"" sort of mode.  


I randomly hit the jackpot in December 2019, going on dates with around 5 women in a few weeks. After years of nothing, I felt suddenly empowered. One woman I dated was über leftist and we didn't really connect. Concurrently, I started dating my dream girl. I'm still dating her.  


I didn't, and haven't, told her that I'm a nicotine addict. Introduce your excuse here: it applies. For me, I assumed I'd quit easily. I assumed the addiction was passable. I got on Wellbutrin. COVID happened. My company im-fuckin-ploded, and day-to-day I battled suicidal thoughts and general-horrors. I wanted our relationship to be centered around who I wanted to be, not what I was addicted to.  


I took a new job a few weeks ago, quit nicotine, and got shit done. Girlfriend, afaik, is unaware I ever used nicotine. I stealth-vaped for 6+ months.  I wanted to hide my addiction from her because I wanted to quit, and I wanted to use my shame as a catalyst. I briefly succeeded.  


Tonight, I failed.  


I relapsed not over cravings/etc. I relapsed because I began to feel like the only course for our relationship was breaking up. That seemed like bullshit. And after some nicotine...  


A few puffs later....well, everything is new. My angst is gone. I am no longer pissed off and I no longer feel like she could ""never get me.""  


Obviously I need to tell her I'm dealing with nic withdrawal, love her, and it'll take me some time to normalize; however, I've got this demon from my previous relationship telling me that I'm a better person while using nicotine.  


It's hard. I don't really have anyone with whom I can discuss. I am so disappointed that I can't be honest with her, or strong, or anything else. I feel like I'm too deep in the pit of addiction/normalization to make this right without breaking up and admitting I'm a piece of shit.  


I need help. Please give it if you're so inclined.  


**tl;dr** I'm looking for inspiration, friends, anything. I am a better partner now, and in months from now, with nicotine in my system. Help me figure out a course of action that doesn't lay waste to the relationships I value. Thanks!",1,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5835293}"

Today I'm on Day 5 of yet another quit attempt but I'm focused on beating my PB.  Here are a few thoughts on smoking that will get me there:

1. Most cigarettes I smoked were either just prior to doing something or as a reward for finishing something.  ""Ok, I'll have a smoke before emptying the dishwasher"" followed by ""Great.  Dishwasher emptied, lets have a smoke"".  Rarely would I have a cigarette for the ""pleasure"" of having a cigarette.
2. To quit, you need a strategy.  Up to 3 weeks, it may be best to focus on the fact that smoking kills.  If you don't quit, you'll die. I'm constantly reminded of this by my wife and 4 kids who apparently want me to live! :-)
3. After 3 weeks, when breathing improves and energy levels are back to normal, the negative health effects strategy doesn't seem as relevant anymore so you'll need a new strategy.  For me this is most likely exercise....""Jeez if you have a smoke, that 5km jog is gonna be MUCH more difficult.""
4. Cravings come and go and depending on the circumstances may be intense or just mildly annoying.  Plan ahead and have a tactic for each type.  Mildly annoying is treated with a glass of water....intense cravings is dealt with by walking the dog or eating cake!
5. I still haven't come up with a strategy to deal with the first hour of the day.  I'd normally wake up first in my house and when the house is nice and quiet, I'd have a cigarette and a coffee.  This morning I found myself almost absent-mindedly looking for a cigarette packet with maybe one cigarette...coat pockets, car etc.  All searched...nothing there thankfully!!

So now that most/all the physical cravings are gone, I'm starting to understand what the **Nicotine Trap** really is. I get it now. Smoking never gave me anything positive. All the things I thought it gave me - relaxation, confidence, peace of mind - were all **lies**. I finally understand what Allen Carr meant when he likened smoking to **wearing a pair of tight shoes**. Smokers walk around all day with a pair of tight shoes, only to take them off for a brief respite (smoking)... then back on again as soon as they extinguish their cigarette. **Non-smokers don't have to wear tight shoes.** 

Not gonna lie folks, I'm really excited about being a non-smoker. I know an addict will always be an addict and that I need to be careful for the rest of my life. However, I'm really excited about what the future holds for me as a non-smoker. I'm already feeling more calm, patient, and ... normal? God, when was the last time I had an interaction, talk, experience without either being high off nicotine or withdrawing from it? What am I like without nicotine? I don't really know the answer but I'm excited to find out.

I still have cravings quite a bit which incite mood swings, but they're becoming less frequent and less intense by the day. I really think that I can do it this time guys and gals. Thanks for listening and for the support!",16,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.7792127}"

Not all 12 days have been easy but some are better than others. After trying to quit multiple times in the past and failing miserably I decided that I needed to take control of my life and change it for the better. June 12th I moved out of a house that had been smoked in for years by multiple people and moved in with someone who only smoked because I smoked (kinda made me feel worse about being a smoker when I found that out.) I was nervous and had severe anxiety about bringing my stuff that had lived in the smoke infested house knowing that I couldn’t tell how bad or heavy the smell would be... it was pretty bad and I felt horrible that I couldn’t smell it so I could fix it. So after a few days of contemplating if I should quit or not I decided that now was a better time than any because for the first time in my entire life I finally lived with someone who didn’t smoke. June 14th was the day I told myself I have 1 month to prepare and then July 13th I would smoke my very last cigarette and that’s exactly what I did. To be completely honest I thought that when I quit smoking it would be one of the hardest things I’ve done because all I ever read was how hard it is to quit smoking and stay smoke free. Well I can say that fortunately I have been quite lucky and haven’t had many withdrawals or cravings since I quit. I’m not saying I haven’t had them because I definitely have just not in the ways or the intensity that most people described theirs. My first day smoke free I spent it driving, being outside and around family who smoked, all things that used to trigger my smoking and it was pretty easy to me but I knew I had harder days ahead. My sleep patterns were and are still all outta wack and my anxiety has been pretty  bad since I quit but I know those go away in time or at-least I hope they will. I’ve been extremely moody and I’ve cried a lot since I quit but I think that’s because I’m realizing things in my life I’m not happy about and I don’t know if my mind goes to this place to keep from thinking of smoking... if so then I might need to consider talking to someone about that. I knew that in the past when I quit cold turkey it never worked for me so this go around I decided to use NRT with gum and lozenges. Let me just tell you that they have been a life savor especially when I have super stressful moments in my life! I recommend them to anyone who has had trouble quitting in the past. This past weekend I went on a trip to celebrate a friends birthday and I was around multiple people who smoked and good gravy now that I can smell I can’t stand the way smoke smells and it almost makes me sick to my stomach. I can’t believe I used to smell like that all the time... 
I guess what I’m really trying to say is for anyone who is afraid to quit DONT BE! Quitting is hard but if you have the right motivations and a team backing you up and supporting you it makes the transition easier. I know other people’s experiences are different but keep your head high and never give up!

The craving for the cigarette is the whole damn hobby!  It's the only tangible feeling I feel from smoking.  The cigarette itself just pacifies the craving.  It shouldn't even be called ""smoking"", it should be called ""craving"".  It's all in the moments leading up to cigarette smoking, but not the actual cigarette.

Is there any advice you guys have about how to avoid lapsing? A lot of people have been telling me that there will be ups and downs and stopping won't be a linier thing. But is there any tips or tricks you guys like? Lately I've been chewing gum like im dying haha

That being said I do want to post in a recovery community as I found them really helpful when I quit drinking and drugs 2 years ago.

Looking back I only picked up smoking/vaping when I got sober. Vaping in particular gave me a truly fantastic headrush that made transitioning to sobriety really helpful in early sobriety but now that I’ve been clean for so long it is time to quit nicotine. I’ve been planning on quitting for a year but finally took the plunge yesterday.

I think one of the major reasons quitting took so long is my massive fear of weight gain. I’m thin. I like being thin and nothing terrifies me more than getting fat and that was the number 1 reason why I never really tried to quit before. Ive always heard that people average about ten pounds of weight gain so I never bothered quitting.

Every time I’ve relapsed in the past it’s because I’ve become fixated on how “great” just one cigarette would taste and feel. 

When I get this thought these days, instead I think about how guilty and shameful it’s going to be when I find myself at the end of a pack within a few hours of relapsing which is what almost always happened in the past.

Was working out. Had a built body. Aside from the stress of work life was awesome.  

I'd go to clubs occasionally and order whiskey on the rocks to everyone's amazement. And I'd be there sipping on my whiskey while people are smoking a cigarette after a cigarette and shoving down big glasses of mostly coke with a bit of whiskey.  

Then I moved in with a roommate who smokes a pack a day at least, serious problems started at work, and I started watching the series Peaky Blinders.

Fast forward to today, I am smoking a pack a day. Drinking almost everyday, My teeth ache and my gum is bleeding sometimes.

Now not to blame my roommate for getting back to smoking not a fricking TV series. But it did influence me a lot especially because I was an ex heavy smoker.  

I see my roommate taking cigarette after no cigarette like no problem and talking about stuff. I see the show where the guy is this bad ass gangster with a life full of danger and he's lighting up ciggy after ciggy and looking so cool while doing it.  

What I don't see is the coughs, the rotting teeth and the bleeding gum, the short breaths, the dark mucus spit when you expectorate. And the knowledge that cells in your lungs and multiple parts of your body are getting killed off and everytime one dies, it could be replaced by a cancerous one. FUCK.  

So in all honesty my advice to you is WORK OUT. And  spend times with non smokers who work out. Even if they're boring and weird.

Hey everyone.

So  glad I found this subreddit. As the title says, I'm four days into  quitting, and it's not easy. One of my parents is a smoker, all of my  friends are, and it gets difficult late at night (I'm a night owl--going  to sleep before 3:00 am is unheard of for me). My body is going through  the expected symptoms of withdrawal right now, and I really hate it. It  feels so counterproductive, but I keep thinking that I can relieve this  chest tightness with a cigarette. I'd prefer not to use patches or gum.  I'm committed to doing this cold turkey.

Any  encouragement would be great. I know that relapse is part of overcoming  an addiction, but I'd like to avoid that step if possible.

I'm new here :)

I started smoking 14 months & 1 day ago and am 4 months & 14 days cigarettefree.
I've had 1-2 months without smoking, smoking every day... But for the last months before quitting I smoked 1 cig/week.
Because the reason I smoked went away because of quarantine, I just stopped asking well. But for the past months I'm thinking about cigarettes almost every day. It honestly drives me crazy!
Physically I'm fine, but mentally I'm craving a cig almost every night (I used to smoke outside at nighttime due to my mom not knowing I smoked/thinking I stopped while I didn't) or when I watch a movie and someone starts smoking I really have to keep myself from taking my cigs.
Honestly, the only reason I'm not starting again is because I'm afraid I'll have to vomit because I'm not used to smoking anymore (I have severe emetophobia, so it's a big deal for me) 
But I'm getting so close to saying f* it, I'll take it easy to get used to it again! But, even if I could be 100% sure smoking again wouldn't make me vomit, I still don't wanna start again as I don't want to be dependent from nicotine (or any other drug) again. 
(Quit caffeine like 2 months ago, and my antipsychotics (doctor said I could, reason was they didn't work) also like 1+ month ago. Used to be lightly addicted to paracetamol like 1.5? years ago but barely took any since I got it under control. Have only 1 prescribed med anymore. So I'm almost drugfree :)  ) 
So my question is, will it get better? Google says cravings should stop at 1-3 months, but I think that's for people who smoke multiple cigs a day. I was at 1/week, 4.5 months in and I still am craving cigs so badly.",1,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.487123}"

I don’t smell like smoke. And the amazing part for me was after 20 years of smoking, it was easy. I log my cravings (between 1-3 mild ones per day now) and move on. This sub helped me do it. I lurked until I finished the book. Now I am actually super proud of myself. If I knew it would be this easy, I would have stopped years ago. You are doing awesome!!!!

Smoking was always my ""péché mignon"", my cute sin. How I was deceiving myself, I didn't like the taste of tabaco so I would add a bit of weed to my ""cigarette"" but I didn't like being high so it was more for the taste. I smoked from the ages of 13 to 36. I went from a packet a day for the first 7 years to between 5-15 cigarettes a day the rest of the time. I smoked through both my pregnancies, I reduced to one cigarette a day, but I will always regret this. 
There are a few factors that led to me giving up.
1) I had signed up to do a course that was very demanding and I was finding the anxiety of needing to smoke distracting and destructive to my studying.
2) I had accidentally spent a fantastic day, (1 day only but my first in over 20 years) with a friend when I forgot my tabaco during the summer.
3) My partner highlighting my borderline depression and his fears that I was spiraling out of control.
So I just gave quitting a go, I put absolutely no pressure on myself. I told myself I would aim for a few days and see how it felt.
I smoked some pure weed to get me through the pains of the first days, and then only used it sporadically for a few months before giving that up too.
What helped me the most was distraction, the need to smoke only lasts a couple of minutes, so I would meditate, have a shower,  do a chore around the house or anything else to overcome it.
The effect in my life was radical it felt like I saw everything in my life in a new light, as if a grey veil had been lifted, I was pretty euphoric. I always smelt clean, I could do sports at anytime of the day not just first thing before I filled my lungs with smoke. I regained so much time, I use to spend hours sitting on the balcony smoking.
I missed smoking tremendously for the first 18 months but the benefits always outweighed this. Last but not least I showed my kids an important lesson, that people can change for the better.

I've (M24) been away from home for the last 2 years in Australia & 4 years before at college & haven't really been the best of people, because of my mental health around college I made the decision to go to Australia & due to cover I'm going back. I wasn't initially excited to go home but I'm going to use it & the four days I had left in Australia to do something about it. I started yesterday initially by cutting down how often I smoke. Normally I'd destroy more than 5 joints a day & today I've only had one & 5 cigarettes all day & I'm writing this going to bed. I have to say, I spent all day today listening to TEDTalks about addiction of all kinds & I've found because I have the right why & goals to help me keep my mind on track (and the knowledge I'll be locked in my room for 2 weeks with my parents having to wait on me a bit because of quarantine when I'm forced home Monday. I've made a pretty good plan of action about it & what I want to achieve when I go back.

I think I'll be able to quit pretty cold turkey-ish because I won't be around anyone who smokes or an environment that I've smoked in as well as having things to keep me busy at home, which isn't sadly happening in Melbourne anymore because they've gone back into lockdown. 

Honestly the main reason I decided I was to quit was fear of my dad knowing, which I know sounds kinda crazy to some I know. But I've honestly been terrified of letting my parents down like this because it was a decision when I started that I already knew they were against it, as my dad quit smoking about 7 years ago just before I came out to Australia. 

I'd not be able to tell you while I started when I was at college, honestly think it was because my mates did on nights out & eventually full-time smoker & the weed helped me a lot when I started having medical issues as pain relief wasn't working. Since I've been out in Australia I've not really limited myself, especially when I worked as a bartender, it was my job to go out & chat then I'd always meet people & go smoke/drink with them after my shifts, as well as living in a hostel so it became very easy to be able to smoke everyday because I know even though I had work I never had a 'bedtime' as my leisure time was always before work, with about 5 hours normally before I started to chill. So I smoked (& drank) a lot during this time straight after work for hours until I crashed knowing full well I didn't have an alarm & knew I'd make it to work the next day easily. So I ended up developing a full blown addiction as all my friends smoked till late too. 

Just 48 hours ago after deciding to quit (I know I haven't stopped but severely cut down already) & I honestly don't feel any worse for cutting down. I've gone from smoking 5-6 joints a day & a 2 bottles of cheap wine & probably about 10 ciggies to drinking half a bottle, 5 ciggies & 1 joint. If I can do that within 2 days I can finish this shit in 3 days before I have 24 hours of travel from Australia to home where I couldn't smoke if I wanted to if I tried (23 hours actively on a plane, 3 hours preflight & 1.5 hours in transition between flights). With my new environment & actually no access to cigarettes anyway.

I'm 90% sure my parents know anyway but I'm going to tell them anyway & be honest that I have so they can help me out when I go back, especially since I know dad went through it himself, even if I am terrified of that prospect.",4,"{'quarantine': 1, 'lockdown': 1}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49726897}"

You can do it!," I am so flipping happy that I've finally kicked the dirty habit to the kerb. Even more so that I can confidently say, I will never be a smoker again. 

Story goes for those who are interested... 
I was a smoker for 8 years (since 18) and towards the last couple years of smoking I was hitting the pack a day mark. My lungs were wrecked, was constantly getting sick, fitness levels lower then ever.. You know how it goes. 
I had tried to quit seriously a good 10+ times. I think maybe two of those times I got to the 3 month mark before caving and starting again. 
This time, it's finally worked and I managed to do it cold turkey without any nicotine replacement. If any ones curious, here's how I did it:

- Firstly I made a very deliberate, conscious decision that I honestly want to stop smoking. All the other times I tried to quit I just wanted to ""cut down"" this time I was serious and ready to get better

- I downloaded a hypnosis app: Glenn Harold - stop smoking forever. And listened to it a couple times a week for about a month. I initially thought it wasnt working because I was still smoking. But I paid $5 for it, so I thought I'd just keep doing it on the off chance it might help. I realised after the month, I was still smoking a pack a day, but I began to stop enjoying it. It became almost like a chore. The joy and comfort it brought me was no longer. Now it was purely out of habit and addiction. 

- After this I moved house and decided my new place was to be cigarette free. I didn't have any memories of smoking and I didn't bring my old habits with me. I think this helped a lot mentally because like 95% of my addiction was psychological. I did it out of comfort and routine.

-I downloaded the app: EasyQuit to track my progress. This is a great free app. It tells you how much money you're saving, how long it's been (you get a virtual trophy and badge for each milestone) and also tells you how much percent of your health has recovered. Eg. At the four month mark your fitness levels are back to normal, at the 6 month mark your lungs have recovered etc. I found this super motivating to stay on track

And that's it! It probably also helped that they raised cigarettes prices by a lot over the last year. But all and all I had very minimal cravings and have 100% no desire to smoke ever again. I can't believe I'm now one of those success stories.",10,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.6012333}"

Quickly realised that the whole thinking about quitting and doubting myself before actually making the step to quit was the worst part. Also that the need for nicotine well outweighs the need for a joint so if you wanna cut down day to day weed use too, better off to kill 2 birds with 1 stone. Was only 2 or 3 days of temporary, stressy-head ringy-shittyness and A WHOLE LOT OF FATIGUE *DAMN I HAVE SLEPT*  but yeah, I could think of a lot of things that are a lot worse, certainly not easy though it takes being serious about quitting, and telling yourself no when you feel yourself being weak and writing off living habitually. Time off work helps, chewing gum helps, food helps, having space from everybody, gaming/youtube through the worst definitely helps but after the first week you don't necessarily need a crutch, I went back to my job in a convenience store selling cigarettes being around it all the time after a week, but remembering that it's poison and the look of some of the people's teeth who come in for cigs is enough to reinforce my belief that I'm now a happy non smoker.

First post on here, so hi everyone

I started smoking at age 13 (had my first cigarette at 11 and absolutely hated it.. oh the irony),  smoked for almost 13 years and then somehow managed to wean myself of slowly. 
I was smoke-free for almost an entire year. Well, until last night.

I'm currently trying to give up alcohol and I was graving a drink bad.. went to the store... stood in the liquor aisle for almost 20 minutes like a crazy person … walked out with a pack of smokes.

I'm still so angry with myself.
Its like something in my head was whispering 'If I can't drink, I should at least be aloud to smoke. I have the right to at least one bad habit."" I know that sounds fucking stupid!  I didn't even enjoy it, tasted fucking disgusting and I still chain smoked 3 cigarettes right infront of the store before I dumped the pack in the trash. And no surprises but it didn't make me feel good or relieve any tension, it just made me feel even more like a piece of shit. 

It's really scary how quick those cravings can come rushing back after doing okay for so long. I'm super tempted to go and buy some cigarettes right now, even after realizing last night they do nothing for me.

This time, vaping nicotine salts are giving me the perfect crutch that I don't even miss smoking cigarettes. So much so that I am asking myself did I even quit? 

I still drag in vapor albeit it's much less harmful than cigarette smoke. I am still relying on nicotine.

I want to eradicate this addiction inside of me once and for all. I turn 20 this year and it’s time for me to say goodbye once and for all so that I can live the nicotine free life that I long for. This channel helped me quit in the past so I appreciate all of your stories and support. Wish me luck. I’ll leave on this note...

Makes me basically feel like shit on all levels, physical and mental.


Ive been smoking for a few years, and at many points ive been able to cut down the amount i smoke from a pack/almost a pack about 10 cigarettes or less a day.

But now, after having some very stressful life events, that have been thankfully mostly sort out, i smoke almost if not a full pack that contain 26 cigs (the previous pack a day smoking i mentioned was with a basic 20 cig pack). Normally i buy and smoke loose cigs, cus its cheaper and gives me more cigs, but i had a point in time recently where i got a carton of cigs as a gift and realised how many i smoke a day and how a big pack of cigs wouldnt even last me 2 full days. Id be able to smoke as many cigs ""needed"" the day i opened the pack, but was left with nothing or max 4 cigs for the next day.

Obviously my case isint the worst out there when it comes to the bad habit of smoking, but ive gotten to the point i sometimes get almost nauseous from smoking so many cigs in a short amount of time, and my go to when i have nothing to do is go smoke a cig or a few on my balcony and this is really taking a toll on me in many ways. It makes me feel worse, mentally and physically.

Is there any advice you people would have to give me? Maybe something to do instead of smoking, or some trick that helped you to motivate you to cut down or completely stop smoking.?

Thanks in advance.

The thing is, there's no reason outside of myself to quit. My loved ones don't care that I smoke and have never made me feel bad for it. My coworkers claimed to not be able to smell it when I came back in (we have separate cubicles and I smoked American Spirit menthol).

Life can be hard. Society crap. As a smoker, I felt (mainly on a subconscious level) that I wanted to self-harm. I didn't care that smoking was ""bad for me"". In fact that made me feel tough. I'm not even scared. I can take this life with a pinch of salt. I'll watch us all die through a cloud of smoke. Afraid? Not me. 

I think that is why it is so common for people to break their quits at funerals. ""My best friend died, I'm just counting down the days here, why not enjoy myself whilst waiting?""

So it is dangerous to quit for health reasons because it is so easy to relapse.

A quit has to be because you hate the cigarettes and you hate being a smoker. The way they stink, the way you're always thinking about them, the way they control you, the way we have no energy, the way they taste. During our quits, WE FORGET how much we hated smoking.

However all I ever read are posts about how quitting smoking is a good thing. Yet since I’ve quit I’ve had this on and off tickle in my chest/lungs that occasionally rises up to my throat like I can’t breathe and even into an occasional cough. The couch itself isn’t a worry because it happens maybe once a week if that but the tickle is constant everyday and appears to get more aggravated on different days.

The only advice I’ve been given is that it’s asthma and because this tickle can become thicker and rise sometimes making it hard to breathe I’m led to believe that it may be the cause and in which case suggests that smoking has hidden my supposed asthma?

Yet when I’ve had a cigarette or two (Had 5 in the 5 months on one drunken night) it seemed to make this hazy tickle diminish and stop. 

As a result, I’m struggling to see the benefits of quitting. I enjoy having a smoke and I miss lighting one up each day and it feels like I’m fighting for something that I don’t believe in.

My cigarette consumption was about 2-5 a day and now I am refilling my vape once a day at the minimum. A friend suggested to switch back to cigarettes because that worked for him. So I did and it does help because I do it privately, I hate the after smell so I am currently at 1-3 a day, which isn’t great but better than my consumption from before.

So, I've smoked for about 11 years, the last 6 years I've been vaping rather than smoking cigarettes and now I wanna quit. I wanna quit because really smoking doesnt satisfy me most of the time anymore (except in the morning).  
I started leaving my e-cigarette at home when going to work and found that though the first two days were hard, after that the cravings and withdrawal feeling got really easy during work hours. I still vape in the morning and after work but try to limit both to one hour each.   
I've also discovered that it seems that 90% of the time it's not nicotine cravings as such that drive me to vape, but rather habit and boredom.   


My question is: I'm going on vacation in two weeks. Should I stop completely now or will that just make my much anticipated vacation a disaster? Since I've already cut down considerably, I'm worried all the free time of my vacation will make it harder to maintain a lower daily dose of nicotine. It's easier to not smoke if I keep busy at work and know my e-cig is completely out of reach.   


I've heard talk of 3months of nicotine withdrawals which I never anticipated when deciding I wanted to quit... but I should add I was successfully able to quit an addiction to opiates last summer.

However, I am hopelessly addicted to Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT). I've tried everything I can think of to stop it, but I can't and I'm afraid if I go cold turkey with it, I'll breakdown and buy a Juul or something similar to vape, which I don't want to do. 

I have managed to cut down from 4mg to 2mg, which is certainly a step in the right direction, but I've been on the 2mg for about a year now. 

My NRT of choice is the Nicorette Ice Mint Coated Lozenge, even though they are fairly expensive. I used to chew the gum, but I would blow through an entire carton of that in two days. The lozenges I can at least stretch out to 4-5 days on a single 20 tablet box. 

So far I've tried replacing the lozenges with a whole host of mints, gum, hard candies, and I even tried a chewing stick. I've also tried keeping myself occupied when a craving hits, trying to skip a time where I would normally grab a lozenge (in the car on the way to work mostly), and simply not buying them. None of it has worked and I end up falling off the wagon so to speak. 

I'm looking for any help because I ultimately want to be nicotine free and it's expensive. 

I think what might work is if I could find a mint that was very similar to the feel of a nicotine lozenge, just without the nicotine. The problem is I like tingle feeling I get that mints just don't seem to provide. I'm sure there's a mint out there that's relatively similar though, I just haven't found it.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5067447}"

There is this sentence going around that the craving never fully stops and you will always like the smell of cigarettes. Maybe for some, but it is not generally the case as:
I don't have any craving for cigarettes anymore. I find the smoke disgusting, especially during Corona or when I'm on a run and I pass by smokers!

It's been ~5 months without a cigarette.  Very glad I quit before pandemic started because no parties, bars, or concerts has sure made it easier.

Short-term withdrawals were comparatively never as big of an obstacle as the longer term.  Stopping for a couple weeks removes the addiction, but the memory of what it was like is still there.  I never was able to forget the positives cigarettes had brought.  I hadn't given it enough time to make good memories without cigarettes.  

Early 2019 I ended a 5 year relationship, and it was of course very difficult.  The first couple weeks were taxing and emotional.  The first months were fine, but I still thought about my ex frequently.  About a year later and I can look back at pictures of us together and be happy about the memories without pain in my heart.  

I'd previously read about how [quitting drugs](https://observer.com/2016/03/neuroscience-is-proving-that-love-is-a-drug/) is mentally and physically similar to breaking up.  Now with some time since I've consumed nicotine, I feel the same pattern starting to happen.  I thought cigarettes were going to be a constant desire for the rest of my life.  And they will, but it's not near as difficult of a battle as I thought it was.  It just takes time.  I'm curious to see how I feel again once a year has gone by.   

Don't beat yourself up if you still miss cigarettes after a month or two.  Your brain was rewired to include cigarettes and it's perfectly possible to rewire it to live without them.  I hope this helps someone who's worried about the later stages of quitting!",23,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43616402}"

BUT, I hit my 3 year quit anniversary today and I told myself that I would come back to post here as a thank you / motivation to the people currently quitting or starting their own quit soon.

I smoked just shy of a pack/day for for 19 years of my life. I started when I was 14.. Both of my parents smoked like chimneys growing up and still do. I always told myself that I would quit, you know, when I graduate ill quit. When I go to college Ill quit. When new years comes Ill quit. When this weekend is over I'll quit. When I get married, when I have a baby, when I buy a house...... and I just could never do it. 

For me, I tried more than 15 times to quit. Sometimes, it would last a week, sometimes a month or two. Sometimes, I would break all my cigs up and then grab them out of the trashcan later that day and tape them back together (unreal).

I have been smoke free now for 3 years (Cold Turkey). My quit is different than your quit, I dont have the answers specifically for YOU. All I know is that having this Sub for a support group helped me immensely, and using the app helped a lot as well. I wish you all well and keep it up! The cravings do stop. I promise.

Like i smoke like 5 days a week ,  an average of 2-4 cigs in a say when i am smoking. There are like weeks when i dont smoke wihtout putting a lot of effort ,but whenever i feel low or too happy i want to smoke just to get the feeling you know?  
What i told you above is what i have been facing in the lockdown.   
I had my first smoke somehwat 6 years ago and slowly started getting addicted to t , but never got above 6-7 ciggerates a day because i can not smoke more than that, i feel shitty. 

I will just give you guys an example. I had to quit because it was affecting my performances , i play football(soccer) . But once i got my fitness back i felt like rewarding myself by smoking once out with my friends , then there was a patch of like 10 days when i smoked , then i somehow stopped for a few days , then again there were patches.   
i think my main problem is that i love smoking, the act , the smell of it, It is something that i do for myself and stays by my side when i am low or too happy , it feels like a relationship or something , but i might not be chemically addicted  as i can live wihtout it for weeks.

TL;DR I quit and feel great.

I've been smoking since 2013, and in December 2018 I quit after reading Allen Carr's book for almost 7 whole months. Then on July 12th, 2019 (my birthday) I had a single drunken cigarette thinking what's the harm? I stayed true for another two weeks after that, then had some Snus (a type of chewing tobacco), then a week later had some Juul hits from my buddy. Two weeks after that I found a Juul on campus and it was pretty much game over. I stayed pretty good until late October as I was training for a marathon, but after the marathon, I just fell into full-on cigarette and vape smoking. During quarantine I was vaping constantly, quitting for about a month but switching to Snus again so still keeping nicotine intake high. Then my city ran out of snus and I bought another Juul and would vape about a pod a day.  My lungs were hurting. I couldn't run or bike with any intensity without my lungs having stabbing pains. I was also lethargic and sluggish vaping all day. So, yesterday, one year and one day after my relapse, I threw my Juul into the river and made a vow to never smoke again. I'm honestly feeling quite good, previous quit attempts I didn't get rid of my actual Juul, I'd just run out of pods and try and hold out, inevitably buying some more after a few hours of suffering. Now I've got a great mindset of how glad I am to not be a slave to a fucking USB drive with nicotine in it, or to nicotine periodt.

Backstory: I was always drawn to cigarettes and loved the smell of smoke and cigarettes as a kid - my older siblings smoked. 
I had my first cigarette at the age of 10 (in 2006), when my mother was sick, I saw that my sister smoked to deal with the stress, so I stole one from her. My mom died a few months later.
I loved smoking right away and my consumption increased with time. I used cigarettes to deal with stress and affect my mood. For a while I switched to snuff which I was even more hooked on.
A close friend at the time got lung cancer at the age of 18 (a very light smoker) and I started worrying about my own lungs. Also I smoked too much and drank too much coffee at a time, which was a bad combination with my sudden onset of anxiety attacks and hypochondria (I constantly thought I also have lung cancer). 
So in 2012 I tried to quit several times and had my last cigarette in 2013. The stress of being addicted overweighed the enjoyment I got from smoking. This was the first time I quit willingly since starting smoking.
A few years later I had smoked a few cigarillos and hookah a few times, also weed once in a while, but this didn't cause any cravings for cigarettes. One time I even had a drag of IQOS. In my mind, I had decided that smoking was a closed chapter in my book.

Now: For the past few years I have had recurrent dreams, in which basically the whole time I am either smoking or looking to buy my favourite cigarettes. In my dreams I am an occasional smoker and I enjoy smoking a LOT. It gives me extreme relief and when I can't find my favourite cigarettes, I am stressed. For a while I dismissed these dreams because I didn't feel this way in ""real life"".
Last year I successfully quit drinking (also something which I have had problems with from a young age). So for the first time I am neither drinking nor smoking (nothing at all). Lately the dreams were happening almost every day and I started craving cigarettes in real life too. It feels like something is missing now that I am completely sober. I am scared that I ruined my brain by starting drinking and smoking so early. When I quit smoking in 2013 my personality changed, it seems like I self-medicated anxiety and depression with cigs. 
I went to therapy after I quit drinking to work on the underlying issues and have had some improvement but I feel like I am rarely truly happy and though I have the willpower to not drink and smoke, I still think about it a lot and have monkey brain. My therapist told me I don't have a diagnosis, my symptoms aren't enough to diagnose me with depression or addiction (alcohol). I told her about my dreams and she said yeah, well cigarettes are very addictive and the cravings are normal. She smokes herself so I am not surprised she has no legit advice for me. I stopped going because I wasn't seeing any improvement after a while.

Maybe someone has been in a similar situation and has advice? I just want to BE without thinking about cigarettes. I don't want to smoke again on a rational level. But I keep thinking, should I just give in so that these thoughts stop? I am probably romanticising the hell out of smoking and will probably not even like it anymore. I hate my brain for doing this after I was content with never smoking again for such a long time. It feels like I'm going backwards.

Having a hard week and a half.,"I ""quit"" smoking by switching to Juul about two years ago. Stopped using the Juul a little over a month ago, while I was on an extended visit with my parents.

I was really pleased by how easy it was to go almost cold turkey from about half a Juul pod a day. (Which is supposedly about half a pack, but I went from almost half a pack a day to two pods a week when I first quit smoking, and then my Juul use ramped up slowly but steadily to a pod every 48 hours. Careful with those things.) I was really worried about eating and drinking without nicotine (as I love to do both) but it really hasn't been an issue.

Instead it's being back in my own place, where I'm so used to being nicotined-up, and stress. I never thought of myself as mainly a stress smoker/vaper since I'm not a very stressed person generally, but I am at the moment and it's rough having only alcohol, THC and sugar to take the edge off. Only one of which can be consumed without it affecting my work (which is the source of my stress and wouldn't be improved by being sloppy) and only two of which I have the constitution to abuse.

I'd been doing so well quitting that I left all my nicotine gum and lozenges at my parents' house. Hubris, thy name is /u/BatteredOnionRings. I don't want to spend more money on them but I'm getting pretty close.

There's always a reason why I failed. There was always a lapse in vigilance, combined with a trigger. I'm now looking at these triggers to see how I can eliminate them from my life.

I’m trying to help him quit but have hit a few walls and would love some tips from those who’ve had experience. Disclaimer, I’ve never experienced addiction so I find it hard to understand but try my best to empathise. I hope my post doesn’t rub anyone the wrong way. Some background:

My father died of emphysema when I was eight. It was incredibly traumatic. My partner and I have a baby together and I don’t want our son to witness that; neither do I want to watch my partner shrivel in a hospital bed like I watched my father. 

My partner has been smoking steadily for ten years. He has admitted that he also worries about his health and has expressed wanting to quit a few times. The thing is, he never really takes action. By nature, he’s impulsive, lacks self control and has been addicted to other substances as well. I think he also believes that he has ‘time’, in that he won’t have to worry about it until he’s older (he’s 35 now).

I’m not sure what to do to encourage him to actually make the jump without coming across as preachy or that I’m trying to control what he does. He’s ashamed of his habit so it has become a touchy subject, and gentle as I try to be he can get defensive about it when I bring it up, fair enough I suppose. 

Things I have tried include: 

reminding him how much I care about him and his health, and that I don’t want him to get sick

telling him the story of my trauma

Sharing positive stories of close family who have quit 

Buying him a box of nicotine gum, without any strings attached (use it or don’t, it’s up to him)

Giving him numbers of quit programs/help lines

Directly asking what I can do to support him 

Saying I am there for him and that I don’t judge him in any way

Unfortunately nothing has really worked. He hasn’t used the gum or called the numbers. He doesn’t know how I can help but appreciates my general support. He hasn’t cut down as far as I know. 

So, what has a partner or close friend done that actually spurred you to start quitting? What should I avoid saying/doing, and have I done anything wrong in my attempts already?

* Head pressure and brain fog.  Feel my brain is not at 100% my short term memory, working memory, ability to focus and creativity is gone. I have trouble focusing and kind of headaches. It takes me a while to focus on things and make connections, imagine things, think abstractly and in summary be intelligent

I have, over these years realized that my addiction is probably not chemical (though it definitely is to an extent) and is probably psychological. I have almost 0 withdrawal symptoms. I have been diagnosed for ADHD which increases my chances of addiction.. I need to be doing something all the fucking time, and I swear, nothing is as wonderful as a cigarette if you want to do something while not actually doing anything.

So my stupid need to keep my hands busy is unfortunately accompanied by extremely easy availablity of cigarettes in my country. They are sold virtually everywhere, and worst part is, you can easily buy single cigarettes. So it is easy for my to go 'just this one' and relapse. 

On top of that, most places I can afford to eat from or get a cup of tea from are street food carts or small food joints. These places are very cozy and all of them sell smokes.

Right now, I'm in a student town; which as you can imagine is completely devoid of life because most students are staying at home because of the Pandemic.

I'm very lonely and bored. This is making me crave smokes every day, every hour..
I desperately need help.

I make bare minimum right now, and my addiction is not helping me at all..

Well, first you need to know that a craving usually lasts for 15 or 20 minutes. It’s similar to the feeling of being hungry.

🚩Do you have to face them for the rest of your life after quitting smoking?

Absolutely not. It is common to experience them during the first days after you extinguished your last cigarette. But, usually after 5 days (probably less) your body will start to forget about them and after 3 weeks you will be completely free from them!

So, here are some useful tips…✔✔✔

✅Keep your mouth busy!
Sugar free gum or eat something healthy. By doing this, you will relieve the craving and you will also avoid gaining weight.

✅Remember the reasons WHY you made your decision.
Why did you decide to quit smoking? What benefits will you experience if you decide not to smoke ever again? How much money will you have saved in 1 month? In one year? Who will be proud of you?

✅Go to a public place where you can’t smoke.

✅Find someone who is willing to help you in your journey.
This is very helpful if you want to make sure you stay as a non-smoker. Don’t do this alone! Find someone you can call, who can encourage you and hold you accountable when going through challenges.

✅Celebrate when you overcome the craving.
This will help you increase your confidence and enjoy your new smoke free life.

First of all, THANKYOU! This sub has given me so much motivation.
Currently i’m 6 weeks in without any cigs or nicotine. I quit cold turkey. 
The reasons:
-My husband quit
- My best friend quit
- My mother and mother in law both deal with health issues ( long issues)
 -  Cigs that i smoke are not being sold anyome
- I WANT A BABYYY SOMEDAY. Husband is not ready yet, but i figured might as well be healthy while i wait😂 

Okay, so these are my main reasons. Besides from money and cancer (duh)
BUT, I DONT GIVE A FUCK RIGHT NOW!!!!

But omg. I just can’t shake the feeling that i’m gonna smoke again very soon. Can somebody help me? Good to know: i take anti deppresives for about 1,5 year now. They have been amazing and i felt great. Now i feel like al my nerves are re-wiring or something. Can’t get any NRT. My docter told me that my ant-deppresives wil do the work for me.

This is the first time i’ve relapsed and actually hated smoking. It’s the first time i’ve felt the damage it does to you after being smoke free. I used to go on 10km hikes 4 days a week, and for the past month i completely stopped because smoking made me feel so out of breath and drained my energy. And i fucking loved hiking. So, today i quit again. And i get back my hiking, my sleep, my ability to breathe without my lungs aching. 

I think this may have been an important relapse, because it was the one that showed me that smoking fucking sucks. I would also feel so shit and jealous seeing all the posts here of you guys showing how far you’ve come. But now i realise i can join all of you once again.

In the dream I looked down and found a lit cigarette in my hand and realized I had been smoking. I can only describe the feeling as utter dread and despair. I actually want to cry because it was so so horrible. I felt a desperate sense of regret, and remember saying “no, I was almost at a year! How could I do this?” I woke up just now questioning reality and whether it actually happened or not.

No cigs, no vapes, just good old fashioned cold turkey QUIT. And it has been amazing. Worth every withdrawal and wave of depression I have had to plow through those first wild months to get here. Best thing I’ve ever done for myself. And that’s no lie. I hit the gym, lost weight, I eat better, feel awesome, lungs work, breathing is great, and so on....GREAT stuff. After abt 15 yrs, 1 pack/day. More when I drank of course. Lol. 

I leaned HARD on this sub for those first 6 months...lemme tell yah...this place is a Godsend. I still check in but don’t post so much anymore. Why am I posting now? Bec after 1 y, 3m, and 29 days for SOME REASON, this week, I’m having intense cig cravings! 
I won’t smoke, I’m past the point of actually listening to my cravings in a serious way, but jeez...when does it STOP??? I can legit go weeks now without thinking about smoking, I’ve even gone so far as to FORGET that I was a smoker! It feels more like a distant memory. But NOW...randomly this week... I’ve been hit hard with cravings and instead of feeling like a non smoker, I almost feel like I just recently quit, like a couple months ago, maybe less, and it’s just the most bizarre thing! It’s like the cravings are tricking me into thinking I just quit? Even triggering some psychosomatic smoker symptoms, which is very bizarre. 

Im actually having lot of amazing things happening to me in life right now, it’s new stuff that does come with stress, but it’s all amazing none the less. So now, after almost 16 months...I guess with the current excitement I’m experiencing in life, it is triggering a major urge to smoke. Or nicotine response. The same level that I had 1-2 months into my quit. It’s so annoying! 

I am a HAPPY non smoker, damnit, and I’m never going back, so WHY do I have to feel the urge when I hate it and don’t want it?! And technically am way the hell over it! 

This is just a rant for myself to vent a little (or a lot) and for those who are deep into their quit as well and who still get bombarded occasionally by a rookie level craving. 

And for those who are new into their quit, KEEP GOING. I’m bitching right now bec I’m randomly craving after over a year, which may be discouraging to you, but I can assure you that the cravings DO go away for long periods of time and usually don’t hit me like this. I’m mostly bitching about how sinister nicotine addiction is to be able to grab a hold of us when we aren’t even looking or wanting it. I’m not even around smokers anymore. Doesn’t matter how long the quit, we are never immune. I’m having to use the same tools and mindset that I haven’t had to use in over 6 months to beat that shit down again. It’s working and I’m fine and I’m not gonna smoke...but DAMMNN. Go away cravings! Forever! 

Sigh. 

PS- I’m sorry if this was a discouraging or boring  post or if it wasn’t relatable. I could post a hundred hugely positive posts saying how awesome life is without cigs, bec it IS. Just today I had to whine a little bec I’m human and I do still have moments of weakness and while few and far between, it’s important to self actualize via writing or talking or however u need to do it.

I have childhood PTSD, depression and anxiety which smoking had helped me cope with trauma in life be it parents, people posting an article on the internet making fun out of being born intersexed when I had artistically expressed myself with body art, and did not realise it turned out bad. Undergoing a diagnoses of autism, which would explain why habitual things help me cope with trauma and incidents in life.

I am really trying to quit, and I am finding it impossible. I get a letter NHS stating just stop spoking like that when they don't even understand the psychological history and trauma I have been through, including several suicidal attempts , where smoking has helped me cope with life.

&#x200B;

I am wanting to quit because I had contracted COVID-19 in March , survived it, had secondary bacterial chest and sinus infections , but it has partially trashed my respiratory system, not my lungs as I thought as x-rays came out clear, but my mostly my  bronchi has become asthmatic-like where it gets inflamed, and causes wheezing, and my sinuses and pharynx. Smoking makes the healing process take longer, and would like every other smoker cause issues in the possible future, and when it does it depends on the genetic makeup of the individual, the length a smoker has smoked , and the quantity a smoker smokes on a daily bases, including the damage caused by infections from viruses and bacteria, combined with air pollution. So not quitting increases the chances... 

I have managed to purchase myself an exercise bike , and I take walks once a week along the beach, I usually do swimming, but the pool has been closed because of COVID 19. I also need to walk with a stick, since I broke my back in attempted suicide. Trying to quit has also increased suicidal thoughts and tendencies , where the trauma and drama of everyday life becomes overwhelming 

I have managed to reduce my smoking, and reduce the relapse spikes of where I have more on a specific day of trauma , but I am finding it hard to give it up completely. Concerns about the doomsday clock , the extinction of life on this planet , Brexit creating extra havoc in my life , like causing the art studio to close shut down doesn't really help with making quitting easier 

I just dont know how I can do it... I am trying , I have progressed... but I can't seem too just stop it.. its frustrating and maddening.",2,"{'covid': 2, 'infect': 2, 'virus': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.63117266}"

Iam off the cigarets for year and half and  cannot be more happy. (Did stop smoking twice  with same method) ( started smoking again after year when i visited friends and they offered me joint with little tabbacco in)  it was big mistake which made me smoking again !!!!! Dont do same mistake  :)))

Did try lots of differents methods to stop smoking  with little or no success to stop.  Not just once but many times .


.
.
Easy way to stop  smoking in 3 steps. (Maybe sounds too easy but belive me ) 

Step 1 - decide  the day you wanna start  (should be right now or next day)
Step 2 - if you feel like really need cigaret then i have good new for you. You gonna get 3 pufs from pipe (weed)  !!!!!! DO NOT SMOKE JOINTS WITH TABACCO!!!!
This way magicaly (dont know why )you trick the brain and you wont miss nicotine anymore 
If feel like smoking again take other 3 puffs. 

Step 3 - DO NOT ABUSE STEP 2 

WHOLE STOPING PROCESS WOULD TAKE LESS THEN 2G OF WEED. ( saying that becouse some people might say its going from tabacco to weed ) 


AFTER NICOTINE ADDICTION BEATED  THEN JUST STOP WEED RIGHT AWAY. (YOU CAN KEEP SMOKING UP TO YOU OFCOURSE) BUT WHAT I MEAN THERE NO ADDICTION TO WEED.

2020-07-08 11:43:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/hnjco7/thoughts_on_quitting_after_5_years_smokefree/,Thoughts on quitting after 5 years smoke-free - mindfulness is very important,"This is my first time back to the community in a long time, and to be honest, I had almost forgotten about my journey as my last cig was just over 5 years now. 
  
I have been recently managing some unrelated issues with respect to stress and anxiety. Aside from the obvious connections these have for me with respect to smoking, the last few years have given me a bit more insight into the challenges of quitting and how a lot of those lessons have helped me manage other problems that have come my way. I kind of just wanted an outlet to get my thoughts down, but hopefully someone else might find something useful.
  
One of the biggest similarities I have noticed between anxiety and withdrawal is the restlessness. Obvious signs of of a incoming craving were headaches, feeling like something was in the back of my throat, shallow breathing and pounding heart, and a weird burning sensation in my head where I couldn't focus on anything other than repetitive thoughts about needing to smoke and needing to find something to smoke.
  
I have noticed a lot of similar patterns in my anxiety. Work- or life-related stress causes the same pit in my stomach, the same sweating and physical discomfort if I try to sit still, and constant repetitive thoughts about how I need an escape. One of the most useful tools I have recently start practicing that I feel would have been very useful quitting is mindfulness.
  
With anxiety (and many may see connections to quitting smoking), people generally become fixated on the past or present, things that are out of their control, and this causes stress, fear, anxiety, etc. They lose focus on their goals, struggle to find solutions, and over time start to lose perception on the reality of whatever it is they are experience. This can be a huge issue over time because the body feels what the mind thinks. If you are stressed out (whether it is anxiety or quitting smoking), your brain will signal to your body it is stressed out. This can manifest itself in a number of different ways such as hypertension, exacerbating chronic conditions, or even send your GI tract into dysfunction causing a set of symptoms referred to as irritable bowel syndrome. Over time, your stress wears down the health of your body, and you become prone to much worst conditions.
  
Mindfulness is such a fantastic tool to manage this. The idea is to bring your focus to the present and how you feel in the moment, so that you can recognize those patterns of intense stress and frustration as nothing more than thoughts your mind is creating. Over time as you develop this skill, it becomes easier and easier to recognize the source of your unrest, and are more easily able to accept it and move on.
  
Mindfulness is easy, and can be as simple as taking a few minutes to stop and feel your breath as it enters your lungs. And during this time, acknowledge any thoughts that try to bubble up and then let them disappear again. You can also practice it more intensely by following guided meditations; yoga is also a fantastic method of mindfulness.
  
The reason I am going on about this is because it has really helped me manage my own stress and anxiety. When I look back on the similarities between quitting and anxiety, I can see how useful a mindful approach would have been to just help manage the pain associated with quitting. Instead of trying to ignore and escape the cravings, you instead embrace them and acknowledge them and accept as nothing more than a chemical imbalance in your brain. Then you move forward.
  
So if anyone is looking for an aide, I seriously suggest it. It may seem silly and can take a number of attempts before you feel like you have achieved mindfulness, but the benefits that come from it far outweigh any of the drawbacks. On top of that, you can learn a new skill that can help you manage any other internal struggles you are very likely to experience over the course of your life.

Might be because I have stopped drinking too (I thought, ""I don't need either of these to have a good time!"")

...but i think I actually might have done. Now I am doing wholesome stuff like reading, cooking and running a lot more, I am never really looking forward to it, at least not as intensely I looked forward to a beer or an end of the day cigarette. But, I had too many of both of those in the end for it to be fun at all (the waking up with trouble breathing, hangovers, vomiting, anxious need for more and more cigarettes with stress), so I knew it had to stop. also, joy comes at the end of the new things: I feel amazing after a run, and I feel proud of myself for cooking something nice - but it's not instant gratification.

I'm just now getting cravings for the anticipation and the excitement/relief cycle of a cigarette. It's really rose-tinted but cigarettes and I did have some great times together. how can this be helped? Thinking ""oh man, I am looking forward to this 10k!"" Or ""should be a great hike this weekend"" instead of ""oh man, I can't wait to party this weekend"" just doesn't seem to match up.

Forgive the stupid question: can your excitement for wholesome stuff ever get to the point where it matches your excitement for a cigarette?

Is there a threshold that would allow for the routine use of tobacco without becoming dependent on the substance? In other words, is there an interval of time I should wait between uses or quantity limit of consumption that would help prevent my body slipping into dependency? I know it may be a everybody-is-different kind of thing, but I would appreciate any insight.

Here is my specific situation for context:

A few months ago I went thru nicotine withdrawals after going from daily tobacco use to no smoking at all cold turkey. I don't smoke cigarettes or vape, but I do mix loose tobacco and backwood guts into my weed; this is my only method of tobacco consumption. After a few weeks, I had completely recovered (I stopped feeling like ass/regained my appetite/stopped cold-sweating.) Fast forward a few months, and the reason why I quit smoking in the first place is no longer valid (I was preparing for an internship that wound up being cancelled by Coronavirus.) I began using tobacco in the same way as before, on a daily basis again, but in less quantity per session. After about a month of this, not smoking all day led me to start feeling how I felt back when I was withdrawing. My body has become dependent on nicotine once again to some extent, even though I was using it for a fraction of the time when compared to last time (my symptoms were far less severe though.) I don't really have a reason to stop smoking, per say, and addiction is not an issue (I don't have any mental ties to the substance/feel like I need to use it.) I more or less just enjoy it and would like to continue enjoying it, but would rather limit my consumption for the sake of not feeling terrible/withdrawing.

I lost someone close because of Pneumonia and now the thought of filling my lungs with smoke is repulsive to me. But I can't get the satisfaction I got when doing some things. The thing is that I used to smoke when doing certain activities, or when I was in certain mental/emotional state. So I want to replace the smoking with something else (creating a new healthier habit). 

 I thought of smelling alcohol instead of smoking, but it seems like it's not healthy to smell alcohol. I don't know why but I feel that if I smell (or maybe eat/drink) something that gives me the same satisfaction (or a close one) of smoking then I'll be able to pull through. The thing is what could I smell...(I think I might have a smelling fetish). What can I smell that helps me?  Any other ideas could help too.

Also what's that app everybody is showing in the posts? (the one that tracks the time you quit smoking.

Relapsing is apart of the process and it’s never something you should feel bad about. The person who has never tried to quit has more to worry about because it means they’re okay with killing themselves. I’m in recovery from drugs and alcohol and in my experience I’ve never met a fellow recovered addict who hasn’t relapsed in some form or fashion. Not saying that it’s impossible but it is highly unlikely to avoid relapse entirely. 

See it as a learning process. What pushed you to the point to smoke again? What situation were you in that made you want a cigarette? Now you know how to fend it off in the future for when you really quit for good. So don’t feel bad you relapsed, it just means that you’re normal like everyone else.

I was reading on a blue bird social media, that he posted that this is his first year after he quit, which got me thinking.. if this guy who can have literally (if not almost) whatever he wants, decided and managed to quit, so can I, right?

I'm here to ask about something that also triggered the decision: I need to take deep breaths more often, and can't always manage to fill in the air (since yesterday, July 3).

 This kinda concerns me and with all this Covid stuff, I'm really scared to go to the doctor and check it out (I'm from Mexico and things are wild, to the point where we probably have 3x more dead people/infected people than what they officially say)

I did the mistake of using the internet to check about it and that's clearly not a good idea. 

My question: have any of you been through this, and then got better? 

I'm really sorry if this sounds dumb, but once I noticed my health change, I decided to stop. 

First day will be today (June 5)

 Context:  I'm male 24, started smoking since 21 a pack a day, or every 2 days.

Smoked since I was 13. Abut 1-2 pks/day. I want to quit, but its got hold of me. I tried patches, didnt work. At one point I put on 5 patches...and still smoked. Didnt feel a thing. I got the doc to give me chantix. That gave me stomach trouble, and made me smoke more. Gum, nothing. I tried vaping, but I vaped and smoked. Tried nic salts, same thing, kept smoking while vaping. 

Its depressing, knowing something has gotten hold and wont let go. I read Allen Carrs book numerous times. The first time I actually cut down to half a pk/day. Starting the second time, and times thereafter, I knew in my head it was reverse psychology. The book was a lie. At least thats what I told myself. Im pretty strong for my size, 5ft7 172lbs. But I feel weak, tired, cough, no deep breaths. I know this will kill me. When who knows. But it will. I have health issues, Lyme disease and Hashimotos. They keep me on my toes. Constant battle. Taking on a knew battle, quit smoking, just seems too much to take. 

I have a temper. One time a co-worker stole my cigarettes. I beat the hell out of him, took off work and bought a new pk. Got disciplined for taking off early, but luckily didnt get caught for f***ing him up. I am a very aggressive person. My temper gets hold of me when I cant control whatever situation im in. I hate someone telling me I cant do something....which sucks because I cant even tell myself no, like when I tell myself not to smoke. I get angry. Rage. I dont know why. I know this sounds stupid. 

Its weird. I quit drinking in my 30s. Drugs in my 20s. Though I did smoke some hemp for pain management the last few years. Stopped that too. But smoking cigarettes...wow this is the hardest thing that ive ever come across to quit.

Again, not sure why I am writing this. Ive been at this point in my life before, realizing my destiny and how smoking will kill me. I cant go an hour without lighting up. Thank you for letting me rant. I am proud to see all of you doing something I cant do. For some reason it makes me smile, knowing there are others than can kick this addiction. I know, that even though my life is ruined, theres others that can live!

It took time, tech, and strategy, but it worked!","I quit cigarettes about 8 years ago when vapes first gained popularity in California.  Had smoked for 14 years prior to that.  It was a step-by-step process.  Nicorette gum never did it for me at the time.  I knew that it would be a multi step process to not relapse, so here’s my story.  I hope it helps someone.  

At first it was a mix of cigs and vaping.  As you all know, vaping doesn’t always give you quite the same hit and satisfaction.  One day I just told myself to keep sucking on the vape and to see how long I could last without a real cig.  The good thing about vapes is that you can smoke them indoors discreetly if you’re smart about it (hold it in until it dissipates).  I found myself vaping nonstop throughout the day, which was fine to me, since my goal was to stop cigarettes.  It took 3-4 days of suffering and craving the real deal cig until I realized the vape was actually doing it for me.  Some days I’d still bum a smoke or buy a pack when in Vegas, but after some time, the cigs felt dirty.  Soon after, I was able to play bball again without feeling like throwing up or vision going black and almost passing out.

So my vaping journey lasted for about 7 years.  I went from juice tanks to dripping, and then to juuls and pod systems.  I still think juuls are great, but them discontinuing the mint flavor was a big step in helping me get off that shit.

I ended up refilling my juul pods with salt nics like mighty mint by vGOD, which tastes almost exactly the same as juul’s original mint.  If you do it right, it won’t leak.  

One day, I decided that it was time to take the next baby step in the process of quitting nicotine.  I bought some nicorette but, and that would help sometimes but my lungs still craved that icy satisfaction of the juul mint.  

In 2018, the US gov’t passed the Federal Farm Bill, legalizing industrial hemp completely.  This means that you can buy hemp, and it’s considered an agricultural commodity.  I used to smoke a lot of weed in college, but mostly quit when I started getting paranoid from the super potent strains that are popular nowadays.  Anyways, I tried hemp because I had read somewhere that it helped with quitting smoking.  

I started with buying multiple strains, and finding ones that had the highest legal THC content (closest to 0.3% THC).  It gets you a little high if you smoke a few hits from a bubbler.  Around this time, I hosted a Christmas party at my house, and was stressed out from all of the people and mess in my house (a little OCD).  I had thrown my juul away a day or so ago in an attempt to quit.  All I had left was my vGOD nicotine juice, so I packed a bowl of hemp and dripped some nicotine on top.  I smoked it and it felt amazing.  My craving was also gone for quite a while.  So, for the next 6 months, my new addiction was hemp + nicotine drips.  But when I couldn’t smoke my hemp at home, I decided to try nicorette to get me by.  It worked.

Fast forward 6 months, and I slowly cut back on the hemp/nicotine mix from 10x/day to 1 or 2, then to completely just relying on nicorette.  

Today, I chew about 3-4 pieces of nicorette per day.  Sometimes I chew one before sleeping and wake up with one in my mouth.  Some days go by and I realize I only had one piece of gum the entire day.  I smell fresh and feel great.  Smoking cigs and vaping just don’t do it for me anymore.",16,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5449525}"

I started because of this Myspace ""scene queen"" i was into. She smoked and I wanted her to think I was cool but that's a story for another post. Ive already started weaning myself off of nicotine and I'm down to 3-4 smokes a day. It's a step in the right direction and I'm happy about it. The pressing issue is im an essential worker in food service which is really REALLLY stressful but if I was able to get to the point where I'm having one pack a week I'm sure I can quit completely. 

I started a new vitamin regiment and I think it's forcing me to quit. I noticed that since I started taking the vitamins, I can't finish a whole cigarette. I start to feel nic sick. I get nauseated and lightheaded if I try to smoke a whole one so I'll have half and chuck it or save it for later. I'm hoping that by my 30th birthday in August, I'll be nauseated just by the thought of smoking a cigarette.

I have 3 little sisters and I want to quit for them. I think it will be good to see that. Hopefully they'll think that if I can quit smoking then anything is possible. I want to be a good influence. I also have acute asthma and the combination of humid Baltimore summers and smoking is definitely affecting me. Also...I'm super into this girl and I don't want to have to lie to her and tell her I've stopped when I have a pack of Marlboros stashed in my bag. Any encouraging words or tips would help greatly. Thank you in advance 🙂

&#x200B;

We have had a long relationship of 11 years. It has been quite a journey. You have comforted me in ways which, if I come to think of now, were not so comforting. I have been heavily dependent on you.

Remember the numerous times I have risked my life as well as that of others by being pissed drunk and driving to local stores just to take a few puffs from you. The times I have had to borrow money from friends because I just **could not** handle life without you. When I had sold my books just so that I could get a buzz by consuming you and your favorite companion, alcohol.  The times when I have literally picked you from the dirt. 0The times when you have 'helped' me to take control of crisis situations by providing escape routes. I will be honest that the escape routes, the closing of eyes just worked fine for me in the short term, that the buzz felt good for the first few times. But over time I have realized that I let you control almost **EVERY aspect of my life**.  

No, I don't need you when I have just had an orgasm. I don't need you to bond with my friends.  I don't need you to 'enjoy' a beautiful view. I don't need you when I want to chill. I don't need you to feel good about myself. I don't need you after lunch to chat with my colleagues. Nor do I need you to fit in.  I don't need you whenever I face a tiny obstacle. You make me run from them.  I don't need you with my insecurities.  I have decided to face them. And I like facing my obstacles, my insecurities,  the resistance that every day life gives you. It makes me feel empowered. I love it here.  With you, I felt weak, guilty, anxious,  and frankly speaking powerless.   


You must be thinking that I have decided to quit our relationship a few times in the past. But this one comes from the heart **and I know you can sense it too.** There is a part of you (or me) which is snickering and waiting for me to fail but I know I won't let that part control my health, my emotions, my peace, my well being and my life. I just won't. I am done being under your thumb for so fucking long. **I am not going to be controlled by you.** 

&#x200B;

You know there will be times when I will miss you. It will always put a smile on my face because **I will realize how far away I have come from you.**

 We have shared some fantastic memories too. You have witnessed parts of me which no one has.  I don't want to have any bitterness against you. I want to thank you for taking me till here. **I will take it from here.** 

Goodbye

I have listened to an audiobook, read a different version and seen the DVD.. Trust me, I understand that I am only feeding the addiction. I don't enjoy cigarettes anymore, not one bit. They smell horrible, they trigger my asthma, they cost a fortune. They do NOTHING for me, and I can't wait to get to the point where I can tell people that I am a non smoker.

But that little fucking monster is eating away at me for the first 24 hours. I don't want to feed it and keep it alive.. I get NOTHING out of it.. And yet.. For 3 days.. I get to the 24 hour point roughly, and I cave in to it.. I smoke a cigarette, just to shut it up..

I know this year has been absolutely crazy, and maybe something got on the way of us ditching this addiction. Many of us have been under unhealthy amounts of stress due to the global crisis and I know this can make it super difficult to quit.

I also know you can do it! and so do I. let's write a new chapter in our lives, smoke free. 
I also want to thank everyone on this sub for the inspiration and other lessons.

I am smoking the last cigarettes on my pack and I know for a fact this time I will successfully quit this habit. Lets do it together, pm me if you get an urge, and don't be so hard on yourself!
Remember to drink a lot of water, have plenty of healthy snacks around and be mindful! This is one of the greatest challenges for us smokers, but as many others in this sub, we can do it! 

Lets be grateful for the fresh taste of not smoking,
let's be grateful for the extra time suddenly appearing due to not smoking!
It will be difficult for a few days, weeks or months and there is no way around it... Make this decision for yourself, for your lungs and your peace of mind. 
Y'all in my prayers, dig deep into your soul and do it! 
much love, Diego
