And yes wen I was 15-16 I smoked a lot I mean like 2 and half packs a day, however if you are really compromised with quit smoking you shouldn't even think about it. The more you think the more you wanna do it. Be smart guys and don't focus on ""how many days I been"" or ""I feel like this"" is more easy if you have consciousness that is a mental addiction. I don't even change the habit, well often I chew gum but thats it. Try it, you ain't got nothing to lose and a lot to win.

I feel such guilt whenever I use the smoke free app because I feel like I'm not actually doing anything... I have had a ton of cravings for ""I need a real goddamn cigarette"" even despite the juul, those I've resisted and logged and when those strong cigarette specific cravings come on I've usually kinda waited them out before using my juul, like instead of hitting the juul as soon as I have them, I wait a while and try to just push back the craving on my own.

I've been exercising daily (cardio and pushups)for a couple months but don't really ever monitor my heart rate, and as I was just sitting around I was curious what my resting heart rate would be compared to hers. I figured it would be something like 70bpm, but it came back as fucking 90bpm and I couldn't believe how high it was. 

I haven't lived the healthiest lifestyle for the past 10 years. But I was still surprised at how bad that is. I've already given up smoking weed and drinking, both of which I did daily for 5+ years (14 months sober now :)). So this seems like the logical next step. Tomorrow I will be quitting cold turkey, as just thinking about how much my heart is beating is giving me so much anxiety. This isn't worth it, and I will save so much money. 

I know it won't instantly give me the athletic heart rate my friend has, but this is the best start I can think of to get there. I know this is going to be tough, but if I can quit booze and weed, I can do this too. Wish my luck friends",8

The day before I decided to quit I smoked 2 cigarettes that my friend gave me. It was like midnight he just came to chat a bit and smoke one but I told him I don't have cigarettes and that I didn't smoke for whole day. He gave me one (then 15 minutes later gave me one more) and the next day I decided I won't go to buy a pack just to see how long I can be without them. 

Now when I go outside I get the anxiety from all the people around me and want to smoke one but I fight the urge. 

Everyday since then I think ""if I just knew I'm going to stop I would have smoked more than 2 cigarettes the day before"". When I think about it I didn't even know I want to stop but now after 8 days I feel bad to go back to it. 

It's pretty hard because cigarettes are kinda cheap here (only like 3,30€) + I have this beautiful Zippo lighter that is just laying here now.

What I want to say here is I didn't think about stopping properly and now I don't want to go back but I didn't expect it to be so hard. Since I stopped I go to gym with a friend but working out doesn't really help. 

I used to smoke like 12 cigarettes a day (sometimes maybe around 15). Those who have anxiety problems what do you do when you feel like having ""anxiety attack"" and you want to smoke but you can't because you stopped?

Currently my personal life is expecting a nearby shitstorm and things might go ugly. I'm worried AF, dissatisfied with my life and whatnot. I have the urge to smoke or at least deal with the stress by something other than going to a bar because I don't want to associate stress with alcohol because I drink too much as it is.

This particular technique is one of three techniques in the program.

I discovered this technique in the [**Anti-anxiety toolkit by Melissa Tiers**](https://www.amazon.com/Anti-Anxiety-Toolkit-Rapid-techniques-rewire/dp/1466451726) (this is a non-affiliate amazon link).  The metaphoric 2-step is one of my favorite techniques for dealing with cravings.  Hell, I've used it on all sorts of things:

Reducing anxiety, stopping panic attacks, stopping negative emotions, etc.

**Step 1. Rate the craving**.  Where is this craving (or negative emotions, anxiety, etc.) on a scale of 1 to 10?  Get a baseline reading.

**Step 2. Set the scene**.  Close your eyes and become aware of where these feelings and sensations are.  Next ask yourself *""What does this remind me of?""* or *""what is this an example of?""* or *""if this craving / sensation / anxiety were a movie, what would it look like?""*

**Step 3. Direct the movie**.  Ask yourself *""What would have to happen for this to no longer be an issue?""* or *""how would this movie transform if this were no longer an issue?""*  Just imagine the entire scene, picture and or movie to completely transform.

**Step 4. Re-rate the craving**.  *""On a scale of 1 to 10, what would I rate this at now?""*  If its not at a 1 or a 0 repeat step 3 until it's down to a 1 or a 0.

**Step 5. Setup your future**.  Close your eyes and imagine being a week in the future in a situation that would've caused you to have a craving in the past (or feeling anxiety, etc.).  Become aware of how much more control you have over your emotions in this future situation a week from now.

After you've done that for a little while, imagine going another week in the future.  Then imagine you can turn around and look back at that event...and see how well were able to stop cravings as soon as they came on.

Watch the video below to get a better understanding of this technique.  The written directions above and the directions on the video aren't exactly the same.  Either way, play with both and see what works out best for you.

EDIT:  I couldn't embed the video from vimeo so here it is

2020-06-28 20:17:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/hhpmmi/quit_day_23/,Quit Day 23 :),"Hi All.

37 yrs old and have smoked since my teens. A 20+ a day smoker. Tried quitting at least a dozen times over the years. Just made it past 3 weeks with no cigarettes (new record)

A few things that helped me get through it:

\- My appearance: 

Noticed my teeth getting whiter, bags under my eyes lessening etc. etc. Not a vain person, but every little helps!

\- My health: 

Noticed a spike in my energy levels after the first week. I have been going for walks and working out more. I find that going for a quick walk specifically helps when a craving shows up.

\- Money:

Using an app that keeps track of money saved. Have used ""non-smoked"" money exclusively to buy myself things purely for my own enjoyment. Very helpful when trying to dodge those cravings. I'm three weeks away from buying a nice jacket (IF I do not smoke). A video game is ""60 cigarettes not smoked"" A new chair for my place is ""100 cigarettes not smoked""  etc. etc. Seems to work!

Just thought I'd post on here to inspire anyone else who is attempting to kick it. Keep going! First week is the worst, then it's mind over matter. Actively avoid triggers for the first month too. That may mean not going out for a few beers with your buddies! So some social sacrifices may have to be made in the short term. 

Good luck everyone!",12

I am almost out of cigarettes now and I don't want to buy new ones tomorrow.

Do you guys got any tips? Do you also use an app? I think that would be funny to see over time.

I really want to stop because it's just bad and it doesn't do anything good. But I am kinda scared as well.

This is my second day without a puff and its been kinda beareble (the longest ive endured its three days) but as my day has gone through and thoughts and urges about smoking have been passing through my head i cant help but wonder if it will ever be a time when you just simply dont think about it, you dont crave or want it anymore, you just kinda forget you ever smoked.

But it still bothers me, and make me nauseous. Everytime i ask them to not smoke near me, their excuse is that i was a smoker and it won't smell garbage to me so to stop whining. What's worse is that my mother is a heart patient and they won't stop smoking near her as well.   


My mother and I, her doctor, her psychologist have given up on them, trying to make them quit, or even reduce their smoking to no avail.

I smoked 1-2 packs a day for about 7 years, slowing down to about a half a pack towards the end.  I never thought I’d be able to quit and was mad at myself for becoming addicted to such a stupid vice.   Between the health, vanity and smell factors of smoking I was fed up.   Embarrassed of always smelling like smoke and spending my money on something that was ruining me in the long run.  

I recently had a skin cancer scare and had to have some shitty invasive surgery, which is what pushed me to quit, cold turkey, the day of my surgery.   No one told me to quit, the doctors didn’t say anything that made me.    It was just that I was having surgery that would leave me unable to walk for 7 weeks and I was horrified of getting a blood clot and dying.   Despite many attempts to stop or cut back, I failed every time.   This scare was a catalyst for me that made it effortless to quit. Completely effortless, I couldn’t believe how easy it was. 

Now obviously I know this isn’t a typical situation everyone will find themselves in, but my point is that it is possible to just give it up.  Find something that drives you to quit once and for all.   

I never thought I’d be able to quit painlessly like I did, but it can happen and you can quit too.

ETA:  I just wanted to add that the benefits of quitting are far more than you could ever imagine.   My favorite one so far is the massive confidence booster of knowing I was able to make a decision to quit and execute it.  It gives me a great sense of control over myself and my actions, choices, behaviors.",17

I mean I don't regret the breakup because it was getting deep into bad territory.

And it's not something I think about constantly. I'm a lot happier. I'm not saying this new girl is concrete and I don't like to admit it's fate or delusional love. I see a lot more how sour the relationship was with my ex. The breakup ended on good terms fortunately, making it easier.

But man... I'm so shocked I felt that way all of a sudden, wow... Just waking up to that. Was inches away from grabbing a cigarette.",4

So I've quit before after 2 years of being a pack a day smoker and had the worst withdrawal.  
All I could think about was smoking.  
Granted: I was stressed with Uni, a breakup, and spent all my freetime just sitting around in front of the PC.

This time, after smoking \~5 cigs a day for 6 months (relapse), I'm on my 3rd day and I've been walking 10 miles every day, eating healthy, and just generally keeping busy.

I've had not a single real craving but I've had nausea and irritability here and there.

Has anyone ever quit without cravings? This is kind of baffling to me.

Maybe it's because I felt done with smoking when I quit, but I'm kind of scared/paranoid  
that I'm not freaking out more.

tl;dr 3 days into my quit and no cravings at all, is this normal?",1

He's been saying that he'd stop smoking since I was 7 and now I'm 15. He smokes in the garage where some food is kept. I keep thinking about all the smoke settling on the produce and having to eat it later. It makes me slightly anxious that I'll develop problems or something down the line if he keeps doing this. 

He always smokes on the deck with my dog beside him, too. She's the only good part of this household and I don't want her getting sick because of him. It's like he doesn't see how smoking could harm anyone else other than himself. Honestly, I gave up on him a long time ago but I don't want anyone else in the family to be affected by his choice. I'm worried about him too. Over the years I've tried every single method to help him quit but nothing's worked. I've sent him articles on the harms of smoking. I've even asked that the only birthday gift I get is for him to stop smoking. He said okay and just started hiding it until he was caught. 

I'm truly at a loss for what to do, and even if I didn't care about what happened to him, I care about the health of everyone else in the house. If there's any advice for him or I it would be appreciated",1

I'm still doing great with my not smoking journey.  I have not had a single slip and I am approaching my 100 day goal where I want to stop nicotine completely.  I have been vaping as a stepping stone to help me get off smoking.  I believe I will never touch a cigarette again and am so happy and proud.  I'm currently vaping 55mg juul pod juice.  Has anyone tapered off it successfully?  I tried cold turkey twice during this time and only managed 4 days and 10 days.  Cold turkey from 55mg just does not seem to be working for me, so my plan is to wean slowly from it.  Are there any online tools or guides or something that I could use to develop a weaning plan?  I'm just looking at how I'm going to slowly go down without causing the major crazy mental episodes which cause me to lose my mind.  I can manage some moderate to severe withdrawal if it's not unrelenting.  When it turns into marathon urges that just wont stop, I lose it.  Thankfully I have always just gone back to my vape each time and not a cigarette.  Just hope maybe someone has done this and can offer advice.  My favorite juice comes in 55mg, 35mg, 20mg, 10mg, and zero.  I think I would probably be fine immediately dropping to 35mg and adjusting to that, and probably could hit 20mg and still be fine after a couple weeks.  After that though, my concern grows.  Hoping to just have a plan to follow rather than winging it.  But I suppose I may just have to.  Cold turkey just is not my friend.  It does not work for me. :(",5

Been smoking half a pack a day for 20 years. But now I have been nicotine free for 3 months, basically since corona madness hit the europe in March. Today, I hung out with 5 friends, 2 smokers, 2 vapers and one non-smoker. I didn’t smoke at all! I had the foresight to buy a shitload of snacks (peanuts, chili sausages, chocolates and what not) which I basically ate a lot of. And I drank my fair share of whiskey, bear, cider and gin too. But I haven’t smoked! Feels good to finally have the challenge of people smoking around me (been in lockdown with wife and kids, no smoking), and actually beating it! 

Feeling good now, probably hangover tomorrow, but hey, still nicotine free. It wasn’t that bad actually. Worst part was feeling the need to fiddle around with my hands and mouth with something during conversation occasionally, while I could visually observe people smoking and  sometimes inhale a whiff of passive smoking. Urges crept up sometimes. Eating stuff helped me lol. 

It was so liberating to not having to think about smoking (so much). I mean, I could keep my fat ass tightly planted in the couch all evening, only standing up cuz of the hot summer weather making my arse sweaty.

I'm a young guy in my mid-twenties and for the most part I'm on a really good track. I've always been very aware of personal development and mental health, but boy has this pandemic given me time to think. The more I learn about the brain, the more I understand how important every decision is. Being so aware of this reality makes every cigarette feel like absolute defeat. Not being able to conquer this (my only physical addiction for what it's worth) is compounding and I feel it.

Due to a recent ban in my country I've gone about one day without a cigarette in recent weeks, and that was probably the first time in years.

The second set of costs comes from the long term health consequences.

I'm a 27m. I've put on about 8kg or 20 pounds since the pandemic started, bringing me up to 200 pounds. I've also been drinking 4-5 consumptions after work every day. My consumption has easily doubled since corona started.
I smoke 5-8 cigarettes a day, or a whole pack if I'm out drinking with friends, which in the before days was twice or three times a month.

It's pretty damn obvious I need to make some serious lifestyle changes. So I'm half-heatedly quitting. I knew I'd be quitting this year, but this happened suddenly and I know I need to take immediate action. 

My question is, did anyone here successfully alleviate or reduce their sleep apnea symptoms just from quitting cigs and booze?

I just can’t go on like this. I have decided to start taking champix but I am scared of it’s consequences. I am not a very mentally strong person and the side effects might break me down badly. And now that it’s already in my head, I’m pretty much done for.

Each time you try to quit and relapse you're strengthening your familiarity with the self that you want to be.

2020-06-25 02:54:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/hfhgk6/any_advice/,Any advice?,"Hi all. I just spent the last few hours reading stories on here. (gosh I can't believe I'm saying this) You all are inspirational and give me hope that I can quit too. 

A little background: I started smoking on and off when I was 21. I'm 28 now and think that it's time to move on, especially now that I'm feeling the health effects as I get older. I routinely go 1-3 weeks without it until I sneak a pack and start up again. I feel great on week 3, but for some reason I make an excuse to cave.  I'm currently at 5 a day (give or take). 

I typically smoke when I'm bored, looking for a distraction, or out with friends (at which point I'm unstoppable). Before covid, I'd have maybe 2 a day max, but it's becoming more out of control. 

Psychologically speaking, I think that my challenges have always been that I can't let it go. 
1) I truly thoroughly enjoy smoking
2) I like the way it contributes to my style (think Euro-boy)
3) I feel that smoking has become part of my identity at this point. I've never been ashamed of it (outside from my parents) and own up to it, to the point where sometimes I feel proud to smoke. 

That being said, I know it's unhealthy, and I need to stop sooner rather than later. I always tell young people never to start or quit now, because it's only going to become harder. 

Writing this post has been a bit cathartic to be honest. I've, in a way, convinced myself that ""it's ok to let it go"". I can see a future in which I am not longer a smoker and can move on with my life. 

If anyone has overcome similar psych issues regarding this, I will accept all advice on how to overcome them.",4

2020-06-25 01:04:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/hfgegu/my_way_out/,My way out,"In A.A. meetings if someone doesn’t know how to share they are told to do a “before and after” share to talk about what they used to do, and what they do now to stay sober. It acts as a guide to the newcomer as to what might work for someone else because it is living evidence it has worked for the sharer. Therefore that’s how I will structure this post as to, at minimum, help one other person quit smoking. 

I used to smoke a pack a day. I would miss out on important parts of family functions, leave a movie in between, and cough up after chain smoking a few cigarettes if I had time to myself. As an addict toward non addictive things, you could imagine how it was with something like nicotine. But I kept on going because I didn’t want to abandon the first cigarette of the day, the one after a long day of work, or the one right before going to bed. I had tried to quit on I don’t know how many occasions but obviously with no luck. Then I changed a few things which I credit with helping me make it to 2 months today.

1. I put myself in a situation that I could not smoke even if I wanted to. This is one that I came to realize was least important but I’d be lying if I said it didn’t help. At the time I had run out of money so to speak. The money I did have left, I sent to my dad for safe keeping. This is obviously not sustainable for a lot of people for a lot of different reasons but luckily, and I’m not lying when I say this, was the least important part of it. If I really wanted to smoke I could have found a way despite not having any money, and something was different about this time. So if you can’t do this, don’t sweat it.

2. The mantra “not one more, no matter what” I truly believed and lived. I actually relapsed on drugs two weeks into quitting cigarettes and I remember sitting there in my bed a little intoxicated thinking how good a cigarette would be in that moment. But I convinced myself that if I didn’t smoke the relapse would be “worth it”. Not that any relapse is “worth it” but today 2 months later without cigarettes and almost 2 months sober, I can honestly say I’m happy it happened because I’m 10x happier today than when I had 5 months clean from drugs and alcohol. So long story short I told myself no matter what happens I won’t be smoking. Not even one.

3. Lastly and most importantly I kept on telling myself it was only going to get worse. The withdrawals I mean. I am a firm believer in “expectation management” in all aspects of life. So for this I tried to set my expectations as low as possible by saying it was only going to get harder as time went on. Because if it got really bad, that’s ok I was expecting it. And if it went by quick and easy, well it just made that feeling that much better. On a scientific level dopamine gets released in the brain when things go better than expected, and the opposite happens when  things go worse than expected so from a research standpoint it makes a lot of sense to do this. 

That is all I’ll say because I’ve dragged on enough and I don’t think with the length that many people will read it. But like I said if this helps just one person reading this then it will be more than worth writing it. And most importantly if you want some advice or maybe you just want to talk, about quitting or not, don’t hesitate to message me. That’s what people like me are here for. To help the next person quit smoking.",11

Monday morning my chest was tight and my throat burned. I still smoked 5 cigs that day. Yesterday, was the same, today I burned through 4. Decided an hour ago that in sick of this.

I was thinking about when I went for a run on day 5 and did not gasp for air at all. 

Ran Monday evening and had to keep stopping to catch my breath. I want to feel the way I did on day 5 again. Here's to not quitting quitting. 

I feel horrible but I will not wallow because I know I am stronger than a cigarette.",16

Started in college with cigs, at about a pack to a pack and a half per day. Tried quitting multiple times with gum (did nothing), patchers (horrible rashes), and cold turkey (i have no free will when it comes to nicotine), and could never get past 5 days. 

About 2 years ago, I switched to vaping. It (almost instantly) started giving me breathing issues, specifically shortness of breath. However, I’ve forced myself to stick with it because 1) it’s cheaper, and 2) it seems healthier (somehow). 

But now, I’m just over it. I hate spending my money on something that gives me no benefit. I hate my shortness of breath. I hate that the first thing I reach for in the morning is my vape. I’m just done. 

So I called my doctor, and she prescribed me chantix. I’m picking it up tonight, and starting it tomorrow morning. I’ve read all over about the effects, and the side effects. I know it can cause bad dreams, but I’m not worried about those. Dreams are dreams. I know it can cause mental issues, but I’ve read this is typically due to mental illnesses the person already had being exasperated by the drug. I don’t have any mental illnesses to be exasperated (that I know of, at least). I’m not really worried about the drug. 

Having said that, I’d still like any tips and tricks you all have. For instance, I’ve read that certain foods can curb the nausea, but can’t find out what these foods are. Do any of you know? 

Thanks for reading and helping. Hoping this is my last week in a relationship with nicotine.",2

It didn’t feel like it came from a craving but more from a place of closure or not being sure if I really wanted to quit. So I stepped outside, lit a cigarette and just as I expected it tasted like trash. I took a short little drag and I just felt consumed with that trash taste and smell. I felt like I could feel it spreading all over my body. I immediately tossed the cigarette and went back inside. I felt my mood shift afterwards. I didn’t feel as energetic and I just felt gross as I couldn’t get the taste out of my mouth. 

The next morning my throat was raw and scratchy just from that one hit. My lungs felt tight and sore when I took deep breaths. But I felt really glad that I took that last hit because it gave me a huge boost in assurance that I’m ready to be finished. I still get these stupid cravings all the time but I know there’s nothing I can do about them and I have to just ignore them.

I'm so glad i didn't gave up on the first day (i was so so close though).

It was the idea of smoking and not smoking itself that i enjoyed, i spent my days anticipating my next smoke and felt shitty about it once i gave in. realized that my addiction to cigarette was not something i could have control over no matter how hard i tried, so i now rather stay very far away from it

It's very pleasing to go through my day without all the anxiety and low self esteem that causes nicotine addiction. I picked up running and it feels so good to not have my throat and lungs hurting anymore. I thought it would be impossible for me to go through my day or to parties without smoking, but right now it takes me 0 effort and i'm proud of myself. This is something that would be impossible to believe when i was a smoker

I'd like to thank all the people in this subreddit for giving me strength and sharing your stories

Give me some good vibes,"33M, been smoking since 14. Wife asked me nicely to quit. Wants kids, wants me to be healthy. Thinks I don't take my own health seriously (she's right) so it's time to kick these fucking things for good. Tried Chantix before, got horrible mood swings. Tried patches, step 1 burns my arm, step 2 isnt strong enough. I hear about weight gain, and want to try and avoid that too.

Anyone got any real positives to share from quitting? I need a little motivation to stick to this. My quit date is July 4.

Edit #1: My wife is a non-smoker, and she really wants me to quit. I just really don't want to be an irritable prick to her for those first few days.

Edit #2: Smoked the last one out of this pack. Done. Tomorrow I become an ex.",45

I'll never go back to smoking!,"English is not my first language. I'd be glad if you corrected any mistakes I might make. thanks :D Also my badge is incorrect

I've just done 50 minutes of intensive elliptical cardio training with some high tempo music.

After roughly 10 minutes of cardio I've started breathing in as much air as I could from my nose, expiring through the mouth. As if I was meditating, I closed my eyes and let the imagination run. One of my goals is, in fact, to sharpen my imagination to the point of being equal to what I had before I started using drugs, smoking, and drinking.

Soaked in sweat, and fearful of my problematic right knee (it hurts badly if I strain it inconsiderately), I stopped at around 50 minutes in. I've made some weight training after that, if not to gain muscle, at least to temper my resistance to fatigue/exertion.

I've never stopped breathing like I've described above...

**And it's because it's so goddamn satisfying.** I feel my lungs purging all the shit I've deposited there by smoking. I feel awake, alert. It's amazing. I have a clearer thought process. It feels so good, as if I were free and light.

I have not breathed like this in years. I would always smoke a cigarette after cardio (after showering to be precise), defeating the purpose of feeling better.

Also, after cardio I tend to keep my back straight (which is another goal I want to achieve ahahah) more than when I'm at ""rest"".

The benefits are endless. I'll never go back to cigarettes

never never never

12 years have been enough.

Anyway, I quit thanks to allen carr's book. It's not like you read it once and then quit. You might have to read it more times.

Intelligent people don't smoke, smoking is simply drug addiction. It is a powerful poison and a drug and every time I light up I risk my health. What is the value of this life without my health? When I quit last week I did so because I wanted to heal and in a moment of weakness I thought smoking ain't that bad why not just smoke and be happy.

As soon as I put out that cigarette I felt enormous regret and wasted the gains I made in a week of physical health. This is a truth and I can't fool myself anymore! Every cigarette not smoked is a massive vistory for health and healing. As soon as you give into a craving you disregard you're health completely and go back to a life of misery and filth. I don't want to be a smoker and always remember if a smoker says just smoke it is because they can't give up the drug and want to be like me, a non smoker. Because they can't quit they will try to make me like them.. A slave forever",5

I know someone alredy asked this here but  I didnt find the post

So how do i stop smoking? Do i do it gradually or i have to stop completely from day to night ?

I dont smoke that much(max 4 cigarettes/day)

But if I cant smoke(like i say to myself today i am not smoking) i will get antsy and end up smoking more than I would normally

Is there a way that i could stop? I dont know if i could just throw my cigarettes away bc I would just buy more feeling antsy.

Well, I found my Achilles heel, and thats an all day party with drinks and all smoking friends. 

To give you some context I quit smoking through Allen Carr’s Easyway and was smoke free for 4 days, and happily so. 
I actually managed to overcome my carvings even through times where I was out with smoker friends. I thought that nothing could take me down as I could even resist the urge to smoke when drinking by myself.
All of that until a BBQ Sunday, where, together with my smoker friends we went on a quest to drink a considerable amount of beer. The carvings began right after the first beer and opposed to the previous times when I drank by myself, I had two things that I did not have before, 1st companionship and 2nd opportunity.
1st was someone to smoke with and 2nd was a source of cigarettes. 
The culprit is that my first smoke of the day, wasn’t even a cigarette but heated tobacco, pretty common in Europe nowadays called IQOS. I thought that it will be different as it is not technically a cigarette, but it was enough to wake the beast within and as time passed I found myself having smoked 2 more of that heated tobacco and 4 regular cigarettes.
I wish I never smoked today, and am very sad to realize that all the progress (no matter how short it is) was in vain. 
I am now resetting my smoke free timer and will  definitely do better next time as I have had my lesson learned. 
Use my failure to not get yourself into the trap.

What’s best? I have become so much more fit. For the past month, I have been working out 6 days a week, including doing both cardio and strength training.

As an ex-smoker, there will be a lot of things you will start to notice after you quit. Smell and taste is one of them. It's true, it gets much better but here's another side to it.

Taste is something you know you will gain and like me, probably don't care. Well attempting to drink coffee with the two teaspoons of sugar I used to have is now sickening.  I now only have half a teaspoon if that. Again, you already know this and don't care.

Smell is the one thing that will affect you more. You won't be able to understand how non-smokers tolerated your stink.  Seriously. It's smells absolutely disgusting. Don't fool yourself into thinking brushing your teeth or having mints helped. You now smell of a dirty ashtray and mint. 

Spraying deodorant or perfume to ""hide the smell"" doesn't neutralise or hide anything either. You're not clever, your lack of smell means you have overcompensated and you now smell of dirty ashtray and too much deodorant/perfume. Most people are just too nice to tell you. 

It's not just your clothes or breath, but your hair, your skin. You won't know how bad until you have quit for a while and then encounter other smokers. *You fucking stink.* 

That person who overreacted and pulled a face with their flailing hand gestures? They aren't overreacting , they're just rude. Have/had a non-smoker partner? Yeah, poor them. It's embarrasing in hindsight.

I'm not trying to be rude. I was one of you for almost 3/4 of my entire life.  I knew all the things you know. I read all the material on quitting smoking. I watched all the videos. Many a time I would watch youtube video after youtube video and get motivated only to give in immediately. I loved smoking. At least I thought I did. Either way, I resigned myself to be a smoker for life. 

I grew up in a house full of smoke. I had my first puff when I snuck one from my fathers lit cigarette when I was 4.  I vomited because I inhaled from the ash end... My point is that I had never known a smoke free home or environment. Even before I started smoking I had always been around smoke and smokers.  I can't sit here and say I'm bouncing off the walls with energy like Tigger as it did have some lasting effects on my health which would only have been worse had I not quit when I did. I am however in better shape than I've been for a long long time. 

&#x200B;

I said there would be tips, so here's what helped me quit.

***The effect on others.*** We all know about the health aspect. We still smoke. Thinking about health isn't really going to help most people. Even if you were told you had cancer, how many could quit right now? You would be more likely to quit if you found that a child or someone close has it. Use that approach when you can.   


***The monetary cost of smoking and rewarding yourself.***  When you smoke, you just set aside that money in your head and never miss it. Once it becomes money that was TAKEN from you, things in your head will change. 

Work out how much it costs you to smoke, then line it up with things you could have bought yourself with that same money.  Ie.  3 weeks no smoking could have paid for X.  Make it a goal to gift yourself.   
Having a tangible reward will motivate you. I wanted a new PC so I made that my goal. I didn't save every cent towards it, I used the money to buy things from time to time too. The perspective you gain even when you KNOW how much it costs helps a lot. 

Here in Australia, the prices had gotten absolutely ridiculous. They had increased 900% from when I had started and have increased several times in the 2.5 years since I quit. 

I've saved almost 10k AU in 2.5 years.  

&#x200B;

***You are far more mentally addicted than physically addicted.*** The more you crave it and the harder it gets to resist, the closer you are to being free of it. Your brain is messing with you. Habit is the hardest thing to break. Nicotine is out of your system in 5 days or so. You may think you are still physically addicted but you're not.  The more you want to smoke, the closer you are to the day you just don't want one. 

I read Allen Carr's books and they did nothing for me. I already knew everything and just didn't care. There was no ""wow"" moment for me reading them. It was after I quit that something clicked in my head. I used to think that every time I craved a cigarette it was because the nicotine monster was no longer making me feel good as I had been without it and I needed to appease it to get my default feeling back. The reality was that I was always the hostage and the craving was actually the nicotine monsters tantrum. I wasn't feeling bad because I was without it, I was feeling bad because I was being made to feel bad so that I would quickly take a hit to feel normal again. *Nicotine didn't make me feel better, the lack of it made me feel worse* until it was out of my system and it became a mental battle.

***Change your habits and routines.***  Re-arrange a room at home, change the order you do things in during the day, take up a hobby, sort out your fridge and pantry. Make big changes in other areas. Change your surroundings and routines any way you can. It goes a long way. Quitting is a bigger change than you think but also not as difficult. All the other changes will make this one less noticeable. Develop new habits and routines. Put yourself in situations that you can't avoid like stairs instead of elevators, or walking to the shop instead of driving. Making some things harder for you in other areas will make it easier for you. 

***Drink water***. I never drank water. Ever. I started drinking it a lot when I felt like smoking until I was full. It helped a lot. I also started to exercise which I absoutely loathed but if you puff yourself out, you delay a smoke. Develop new habits one step at a time. 

***Throw out your smokes***. If you want to quit then do it.  You are either a smoker or a non-smoker, there is no inbetween. Don't keep them around. Make it harder for yourself to have one. There is no such thing as trying to quit. You are now a non smoker until you become a smoker again. Again, tying back into your saving goal and self gifts. Go online and look at the things you could buy instead of another packet of smokes. 

***Keep your hands busy.*** Get something to play with for when you are sitting around. If that means taking up a hobby then do it. If it means getting a fidget spinner, then do it. Keep your hands busy. I bought a deck of cards and started learning cardistry just to keep both my hands busy. I had no interest in it initially but doing things I had never done before became a part of the process. I  started building models which I never done since I was a kid. I started doing sit ups. I started doing all kinds of things just to keep busy and then found things I liked doing. This all ties into the habit and routine changes and I can't emphasise that enough. Quitting is far more mental than physical. You will feel that you physically need a smoke, but you don't. Keep your hands busy and change your routines and habits. 

***Everyone can quit.*** A lot of this is common sense stuff and I know reading it from someone else is more of the... yeah, I know but.. 

But nothing. I never thought I would quit but I did. I heard that all the time too but I didn't care and to be honest, it really annoyed me when I heard people say it as it may annoy you right now. Doesn't mean it's not true. There is not a single person on the planet that can't quit. You just don't realise how easy it is if you change your thinking towards it. You know all you need to know already, you have just accepted some things as normal when they're not.  

You know you can die but still smoke. You spend a tonne of money on them but don't care. You are doing something to yourself that you would not wish upon your loved ones, but don't care. You wash your clothes, bathe and shower, brush your teeth and then immediately negate all of it by making yourself like an ashtray.  Again, you don't notice it because you always stink. 

Some of you may even approach strangers asking for a smoke. The more desperate may have found themsleves scavenging the ground or looking through ashtrays for a butt when you have run out of smokes. You do things you wouldn't normally do, think things you wouldn't normally think and you have accepted things that you know are unacceptable. It's insane. Don't put it on a pedastal like it's one of those things you want to do but think is too hard.  It really isn't.

I don't miss it. I loathe it.  The smell makes me feel sick. The insane amount of money I wasted makes me feel sick. I couldn't care less about the health side of things but yes, you will look and feel better too. You're here because you want to quit and I'm here because I am the last person on the planet anyone expected to quit and I did it alone and cold turkey and it was easier than ever before. I didn't go into it all that differently, but once I started, something in my head just clicked and I realised I could do it and I already know I will never smoke again. I know that 100% and would place my life on it.

I've probably forgotten a lot of important things, but I will continue to add if they come up. Feel free to ask any questions if you're having a tough time. I won't say good luck as even the unluckiest person in the world can quit. 

If you have been thinking about quitting, came here and read all of this in one sitting, then you have most likely already had one less smoke than you would have had. Not that hard is it? Don't go and have one now as there are more stories for you to read. If you've gone 5 days already, then those are the hardest 5 days you will go through even if it doesn't seem like it and as I said earlier, the harder it gets and the more you crave it, the closer you are to being free from it. You are almost there.",40

Alan Carr said quitting while you have a lot going on is actually good because you can prove to yourself you can handle anything without resorting to the crutch of a cig. 

Also, today I woke up not feeling like I was hungover for once. I got out of bed and ate fruit... it beats a morning cig.

He stopped for a couple of month in 2004 when he was involved in  a car crash that put him in a coma for a month and kept him hospitalized for another one.

He was diagnosed in November because of severe pleurisy which made his oxygen saturation drop.

In spite of chemo- and immunotherapy cancer spread to the liver and to the bones by February.

In May the oncologist decided to switch to palliative radiotherapy to manage the pain.
At the beginning of June the situation rapidly deteriorated and sedation with benzodiapezine was started.

After a week his body could take it no more and he passed away in his sleep at the age of 59.

I quit smoking for a couple of reasons:
* a logical one, because I had started eating healthy, exercising and I could wrap my head around keeping on poisoning myself with cigs
* an emotional one, because he rationalized his inability to stop smoking by saying that it was impossible, so I decided to prove him wrong (we didn't get along well)

Dying of cancer sucks: he was a very proud man and during the last couple of weeks he would start sobbing desperately because he was too weak to walk and to go to the bathroom. He basically withered away, eaten up by his own crazed cells.

His father (who died of oesophageal cancer when I was a kid) used to say ""Amaro cu mori? Amaru cu resta!"" (a Calabrese saying which roughly translates as ""Those who die aren't wretched. Those who survive are"" and I'm beginning to understand why he used to say so.

By day 5 the pain was gone but my head was foggy, by day 6 the fog was gone but now I don't feel anything?

I can't feel joy, I can't feel sad, and I don't register anything in between. I mean, I can experience some irritation and mild anger but that's it. Everything I enjoyed before I dont, everything I was repulsed by I now feel indifferent. Things can be interesting to me, but I don't like or dislike them. Eating is a chore and interactions with people is more akin to strenous excercise. 

 Before you say it's depression, it doesn't feel anything like that. I KNOW depression, I've been there many times. The numbness of depression is more like a ""static"" to me, it's feeling so sad and miserable it becomes too much and I become distanced or overwhelmed. 

This is nothing like that, there's just an absence of any feeling. 

I'm functioning, doing work and chores and things I NEED to do, I just have nothing to feel about that or anything else. I'm either avoiding interaction with other people or faking emotional interest until I figure out what this is or how long it will last.

That isn't to be discouraging though. In fact, if anything I'd say staying a non smoker is easier than the act of quitting itself. 

That being said, I've seen a few posts and comments in this sub talking about how sad they are without cigarettes, how they can't smoke anymore, etc. And that makes sense as it is something you were so used to doing that you now are adjusting to without. Same goes for ending any routine or hobby that you were so used to that ends all of a sudden and feels like a disruption in your daily life. 

However, instead of looking at it as ""I miss smoking"" or ""how I will carry on without cigarettes"" it's important to look at it a different way through many of these phrases. 

1. You successfully did something most smokers wish they could do, quit. 
2. Emphasizing the benefits such as how much money you're saving on top of feeling, smelling and breathing better among many other things. 
3. You're free from nicotine addiction as opposed to being enslaved to it like you once were. 
4. The percentage of adult smokers is now down to 15%, you are now part of the majority. 
5. You are now a non-smoker and don't have to worry about hiding it from others who may be concerned such as family, friends, potential significant others, and others who will see it as a big deal (rightfully so). 

This is how I reaffirm myself that I am now a nonsmoker. It is better to look at it these ways as opposed to looking at it as ""I quit smoking because I had to"" or ""someone else wanted me to quit and I'll miss it"". Remember you are quitting for your sake first, not others.",11

after vaping 0mg fluid for a couple months I bought a pack of cigars, I smoked them and got re addicted to nicotine, I smoked for a month or 2 and decided to go back to the vape

so I repeated the process, I vaped for a few months till I forgot about likeing smokes, got more varenicline from my doctor and started reducing my nicotine content again

and then I started smoking yet again, this time just weeks after reaching 0mg fluid

so now I got half a pck of smokes left, im putting nicotine back in my vape and am going to go from smoking to vaping for the third time

I just confused as to why I cant seem to stay quited

this time I dont think im going to taper all the way down to 0mg, I think I will taper down to like 1mg or 0.5mg fluid and stay there for a while, I liked vaping 0mg fluid cause of the cost savings, a 120ml bottle only cost about $5 with no nicotine, with nicotine being the most expensive part at like $0.25 a ml

the first time I ever switched to vaping, I vaped 6mg for like years, never bothered to try and taper down till I decided to try and quit, but now I have tapered twice and both times found it pretty easy, so I will taper down to something low this time

maybe I will try and quit again next year",1

My boyfriend has been a smoker for 10 years but always resented it. Yet he really does not like it if people mention it to him that he should stop. He says it has the opposite effect on him. So when I got a relationship with him I learned quickly not to do so. instead I tried to understand how he felt about it, his relationship with the habit and to be supportive when he was trying to quit, but not interfere to much because it is something he wants to do on his own. In the summer of of 2019 he decided to quit cold turkey again. and this time he succeeded. I was so proud of him and he too was very happy to be finally rid of it. 

In the following months he sometimes still bought a new pack, smoked one or two and the next day threw them out again, because he did not want to get started again and his body reacted badly to it. Every time he did this, he confessed this to me. He felt guilty every time like he tried to apologize to me. I never got mad or showed any form of disappointment. I always say that I am not the person he should apologize to, but that I am there for him because I see he is struggling and won't love him less for it. 

Yet now he has been a lot under stress with work and the pack did not disappear after a day. He kept smoking for  the rest of the week. Then there were a couple of days without one but when the work stress picked up again, he succumbed to the next pack of cigarettes. This has happened now 4 times. He actively tries to buy the brands he does not like and during the third pack he drained it in water on 2/3 on a certain morning because he had so much trouble breathing during the night.   
I told him during the second time he was smoking through a pack that I was worried and sad he was falling back into addiction, not because it affected me personally but because he always told me he does not want to smoke and worked so hard to achieve it and I don't want him to feel devastated after losing that progress again. I never try to put my own opinion/struggle/sadness about his habit because I want him to have a safe space where he can talk about his issues without being judged by it. 

**Main problem:**  
I think that the main problem is that he always used smoking as a way to cope with his stress and issues. Every time he has to much stress he has trouble dealing with it on a constructive way or let it go after he is done working and falls back to the only habit that seemed to work: Smoking. He also has difficulty talking about things that are troubling him. He just conditioned himself to bottling it up and that he has to deal with it by himself. I see when he is troubled and I make him aware of it, but I won't force it out of him. I acknowledges it that he is struggling but not always tells me what it is. He helps me a lot with my issues and it makes me sad that this makes it so much harder for me to help him in return. 

Yesterday he started his fourth pack after having quit for almost a year and this time I confronted him with that if he wants to break this pattern we need to find a better way to deal with his stress or else he will never be rid of it. He agrees and was actually open to ideas. Do you maybe have experience with healthy ways of dealing with stress for someone who used smoking as an outlet?",2

What’s annoying is that I know if I smoke it’s only going to make me feel/smell/taste like trash. But the cravings are so constant. Just always feeling like I just remembered some great thing that I want but can’t have. Surely this feeling goes away one day right?,4

(8 weeks off nic),"I’m a 19 year old college student and I used to juul and then I stopped due to heart palpitations which scared me so bad that I went to the ER. My heart started to skip beats about 1 year into juuling. I was juuling a pod a day almost. Doctors said it was nothing, it lessened, I never had any nic of my own for about 2 months almost. I smoked the occasional cig at parties until I came home from Xmas break. Meanwhile these palpitations hadn’t gone away and I was having them since September, it was December now and I said fuck it and started chewing dip/smoking. Smoked all the way up till late April and quit because I was still getting palpitations which I never had got before I started nicotine. Now I’m about 2 months deep into quitting for good and I still get palpitations. I’ve done everything to try and get rid of them (I get 1-3 a day). I stopped smoking/juuling/dip, I’ve started doing lots and lots of cardio, lost weight, smoke weed only once a month, and drink maybe 2 times a month. I still get these palpitations. I’ve read on sites that they are supposed to be gone by the time you are 5 weeks into withdrawal. PLZ SOMEONE TELL ME IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING THIS IM GOING CRAZY AND REALLY NEED SUPPORT.",4

I'm stressed, going through a breakup so my heads a complete mess and because I moved to the opposite end of the country and settled down with a bird immediately I didnt bother making any mates to help me through this. 

Now my parents are visiting, unanounced and uninvited. They do my fucking head in and do nothing but irritate me. 

I just tried to go for a walk to get out the house and ended up buying a pack. 
Smoked half of one and hated it. It tasted fucking terrible. Smelled awful, and gave me no sense of relief at all. 

Made a video of me having ago at myself and binning the pack. 

When I get the same feelings again i'll hopefully watch the video and not go through the bother of getting another pack. 

I really dont want to reset my smoke free clock as the 11days count is the only thing i feel like I've achieved in the last two years. 
I dont think I really need to reset it either to be honest as I'm on champix so the nicotine didnt even effect me and I hated it, threw the whole pack away after just a few drags. It's not like I chained the whole 20 and will again tomorrow.

Last night, I put on a new mattress cover...the old one was really old.  It had sweat stains, yellowing, frays, and suffered from my life as a drinker and smoker.  

I'm 150 days free from alcohol, which I quit so I could successfully quit smoking...journal entries helped me fully understand the extent of my triggers, my problems with these vices, and how long I've been trying to Quit.  The positive feedback is important, because the body and brain have been real shitty to me in the past by justifying the deathly habits as needed to survive happily.  The list of physical accomplishments since quitting is long, which have goals achieved and bested...the other lists are impressive with a better life overall.

Thank you r/stopsmoking for posting and commenting and sharing.  I've tried and tried and tried over 25 years to get clean...and there are fundamental differences that make this Quit successful from others...BUT, this group is a big part of the reasons why.  It's not about the Op posts I make...it's the comments, the ones I make and reminding myself I can't be making commentary if I'm not walking the walk.

The bed cover is huge...it cost 19 bucks, but I would never have spent my limited money on it before, because I needed to smoke and drink and forgoing the little things seemed necessary...I can't believe I waited so long.  

HUG, I used to think a lot of things...I still do...but, I am sure that Smoking Cigarettes and nicotine addiction and alcohol abuse are not helpful to me in any way.  I am Free and fiercely protective of my health...I will defend my health to the best of my abilities so I can continue to live Free.",56

I sit on the shitter with my vape in my hand regardless of whether or not i smoke it. Just so its there... I smoked for 5 years have been vaping another 5 for rationale. Even if it is better im just so fucking tired. Im tired of feeling that i just have to hold this fucking thing. Tired of how anxious i get when i dont know where it is. Tired of getting so fucked on nicotine because basically freebase unlimited nicotine. A part of me wants it, wished i could smoke and be fine and i could just give in to things. But i hate that its not something you can enjoy. It just creates an exhaustive psychological cycle. I had too many last smokes. I know you never quit you just dont smoke. Longest I quit for was about a year somewhere in the middle of cigs and vapes. The one last one got me good. I dont even know if i just dont care anymore and i hate thay i cant tell if its me or nicotine. Ive lost most of my family with cancer. I hate that i feel like i dont care at this point when as a kid i would throw my grandmas pack of cigarettes out the car every chance i got just to give her a little more time. Im just tired and i cant think straight. The hyper rationalizing is pushing hard. I used to a be a huge runner and even though i had vastly better lungs than most people as non smokers i can feel it reaching a point of no return. But today... I want to be done again, preferably permanently. I hate it i want it out. I could just go cold turkey and grit my teeth, ive done it multiple times but that would require me to be all in wanting it. And a part of me doesnt, im sure its tied in to some sort of cycle of self abuse and depression which i dont deal with anymore on the same level but nicotine doesnt help the environment. Im tired of getting angry at me and nicotine saps all my physical energy. Im tired of skipping eating because im pissed i wont quit smoking. Im tired of having to fill myself til im sick before going to sleep so its in me until i pass out or stay up til 5 just to keeo awake and slowly puffing away. I know its not the only source but it sure doesnt help and its one thing thats a major physical factor that should be easier to rationalize stopping. I just want to be done.",2

For the last few weeks I've been feeling down and fantasizing about smoking quite a lot and today I finally convinced myself that now is not my time to stop smoking which is my 2nd attempt in the last 18 months.

And so off I went, bought cigarettes which tasted horrible and now here I am, feeling like I am back to square one. I'm very disappointed in myself and my family must be too but are doing their best to be accepting of me due to the pressure I've been under.

I don't want to start smoking again. I just feel so weak. It's pathetic. 

I've read Alan Carr's book twice and listened to the audiobook once and yet still I weaken and go into self destruct mode. 

I convinced myself that cigarettes are the answer but after smoking them I know they aren't, I always knew that but hey, I'm an hopeless addict. 

Even now as I write this, I feel scared to let the rest of that packet go and throw it in the bin and reaffirm my resolve to stay stopped. But I also know that if I smoke them I will hate myself more than I do right now. 

After the honeymoon period of having stopped wears off, I am left with this gap where smoking used to be and I'm honestly struggling with that.

I beat heroin addiction over 25 years ago and smoking is honestly by far the most difficult thing to stop. I should be able to deal with this better but I just feel like it's impossible. My subconscious shouts at me in my head ""you're pathetic!"" as I type this. It can't be that impossible but it feels like it!

I'm not sure what I'm hoping to achieve by putting this here, I know only I can do what needs to be done but you never know, someone in this wonderful community could find some magic words that might make the difference.

Stay safe and well everybody.",2

"" and I said ""yes"" and i meant it for the first time.

I've also listed all my cigarette triggers and found some replacements for them..

I m really fed up, and the worst thing about cigarette is that it made me HATE myself, it's even worse than cancer, i spent 8 years of my life self-shaming and self-blaming myself with each cig i light up. I spent 4 years telling myself that i won't get hooked and 4 other years telling myself that each cig i smoke is my last.

It was always my crutch and I swore never to smoke again after my grandmother's terminal lung cancer cancer diagnosis and subsequent demise.

My life fell apart since then. I hate to admit it, but it did. I've always suffered from bouts of depression, but since her death, everything that can go wrong has gone wrong. I moved out of what I consider an abusive household in 2018, and I've made ends meet until now. It was my time to get life back on track,  cigarette free.

But here we are, in 2020. So many of us said this would be our year - even our decade. Little did we know, huh? It's been a rough one for all of us. For me,  I've been struggling - my roommate revealed three months ago that his partner was pregnant and he was moving out, leaving me with a two bedroom flat to myself. He's since had the kid, and now I'm struggling personally. 

Searching for a new roommate has proven stressful, since we're in the middle of a pandemic. I've been panicking over money ever since. I also feel close to giving up and quitting my job. In my job, I take abuse from customers who treat me like dirt. I hate my job more than anything in my life  I don't think I can take it any longer. It physically makes me ill and every day, I find myself more depressed than the last. And yet, I would pride myself on quitting despite my misery. 

Tonight, I indulged in a park gathering with friends. We drank and had fun at a social distance.  I wish I could say this was enough, but it was not. I asked a friend if I could tap a cigarette, despite reminding myself I quit. Even my friend who supplied it asked if I was sure. I was. In fact, I actually had two.

I wish I could say I hated it, but I didn't.  I loved it. I savored each draw. I heard people laugh as I zoned out, and just focused on my breath as I suckled upon my own personal demon. But at the end of the day, I also don't think it helped. I'm just as miserable after than before. It doesn't help after all, I guess.

Anyway, not to rant, but I guess that makes me an ex-ex-smoker now.  Go figure I'd be back in this position, but with how life panned out, I guess it was only  matter of time.

I'll hopefully quit successfully next time.",5

I had spent all day today thinking about cigarettes—even planning when I was going to allow myself a sly one next. The craving had made me consider just accepting addiction as fate. 

After the latest lapse I’m now on day 5 smoke free. I’d been lamenting being back here again—I’d broken an 11 day streak, which my longest in a while—but seeing my progress over time has encouraged me again, as I would never have thought I could have smoked so little and seldom.

I won't be taking cigarettes with me, but, I'd love to know how people get over this hurdle or simply avoid it when they're quitting. I'm worried I'd smoke a few and then that might spiral into getting hooked all over again. 

Not drinking is an option, but there's someone going to this small gathering I'd rather avoid so alcohol will help 😂

Now the thing is that these first 2 weeks went quite easily, i was with my family, away from home, no temptations and friends around... 

I’m about to get back home, being on my own and that’s the hardest part of the game. 

I planned to exercise more, i still have my nicotine spray to prevent cravings. I am here to ask for advice and tips: 

I noticed i repeatedly relapsed (in my previous attempts) when i was a little down, with the famous auto-lie « just one cigarette/drink/junk meal » I know it s a complete lie and the brain is trolling so what are your methods when you have to deal with that when it hapens to you ?

It feels great! What helped me the most is coming up with a phrase you tell yourself when a craving starts. It helped me stop cravings as they were forming, not allowing them to become thoughts, ideas or internal monologues. It doesn't have to be a negative phrase, mine is actually kind of comical. And it doesn't even have to be related to smoking.

In my experience day 1 was bad, day 2 was the worst and from day 3 onward it got easier. By day 5 i got maybe 2-3 cravings day and they were very mild.

And one last tip from when I used to smoke regularly. Smoking after you just are yogurt sucks! Smoking after eating Dairy products in general sucks, but yogurt makes it the worst imo.",9

At my latest appointment, I talked to my doctor about it because I've been feeling like crap lately *(can't even finish mowing the lawn without getting out of breath.)*  and prescribed me Wellbutrin *(I also suffer from depression)* since Chantix counteracts with my epilepsy medication.

The one thing the doc did say that there was over a 90% success rate with the patients he's prescribed it to, all relatively low dosages, too.

I'm about a week in and haven't noticed any difference, but I'm slowly weaning up to my target dosage *(250mg)*. So I'm curious... Has anyone who initially tried Chantix have to move over to Wellbutrin *(like allergic reactions, etc.)* and notice similar results? I've searched high and low in regards to this topic but couldn't find anything.

But with week four my cravings started to escalate daily. Yesterday I had a weird dream that ended in part with me smoking a bunch. I woke up incredibly tense and I literally spent almost the entire day White knuckling it. I was probably the most irritable and tense I’ve been since the day I quit. 

I looked online and they said that withdrawal symptoms were supposed to peak at two to three days of the nicotine being out of your system. So I’m confused. Does anyone have experience with later or prolonged withdrawal symptoms? Thanks!",3

I've simply built up a list of reasons or fears that prevent me from quitting. That fear whenever a pack runs low, or when I think about going out drinking, or long drives. Any excuse to continue smoking. I'm so over it all.

I will miss nothing about smoking, there will be only lingering fears that the cigarettes created that have nothing to do with my actual mentality regarding smoking. I need to make it clear in my mind that those fears and excuses are not real, they are only mechanisms of the cigarettes that kept me addicted.

I'm 4 days into my no smoking journey (20 a day 11 years) I've tried to stop before but they were half hearted attempts, this time I feel like i'm in the right frame of mind, I thought lockdown would be a good time to quit and I'm fully committed this time round.

My issue is I'm finding it scarily easy, I've had one or two cravings but they've been very mild, I have been using a vape with low nicotine a few times a day just to take the edge off, I'm conscious to not use it too much as I dont want to swap one habit for another.

My concern is once I return to work (I'm off at the minute due to covid, expected back start of August) will I be hit with a barrage of cravings? I'm concerned because I obviously had my normal routine, wake up smoke get to work smoke mid morning break smoke etc. 

I guess my question is am I being lured into a false sense of security and it's going to hit me like a steam train once I return to work and my normal routine? If so does anyone have any advice on this?

When woke up again the shop was well and truly open so I had a shower got dressed and grabbed wallet.  I’ve been trying past few years to give up smoking with little success. 
AlwYs manage to convince myself one is ok and we all know where that leads with this addiction

I thought well there’s none in the house good time to quit.   I have been to the shop or bought any since.  I have to send my housekeeper to get the milk because if I go over there they’ll probably just hand me a packet or the temptation will be too great

Having done this before knew what to expect from day 1,2,3 and they didn’t disappoint.  Day 4 wasn’t so bad but day 5,6 were horrible.  Felt nauseous all day sometimes dizzy cravings really bad and hardly slept the insomnia really kicked in

Day7 still felt average but forced myself to do a bunch of stuff.  In lockdown so some gardening made guacamole made banana cake. Made roasted veggies which turned into soup and cooked some sweet corn instead of eating chocolate.  Indulged in a mango as well
So got thru that

It’s day 8 now it’s early  the shops just opened. I’m dying to go and buy some but I won’t because I only want one puff really and cigarettes come in packets!!  

No not going to blow this.  My breathing is so much better after just a week. Fuck you nicotine and your addiction.  I’m going to make fresh coffee and a yummy breakfast and celebrate you not being around

So WHY did I smoke a fucking cigarette? WHY? I'm so mad at myself. My husband smokes so I can't ever fully get rid of the temptation. But I wasn't even craving one. I was just bored. 

I convinced myself that I should try just one more. It will HELP me, is what I told myself. It will be so nasty and I'll never smoke again. Just one. I don't have to reset my clock for just one.

But as you guessed, it wasn't just one. It was just one that day. And for the next few days. But then I looked at my smoke free clock and I felt like a failure. I cheated myself with that one cigarette. That one, nasty cigarette that didn't benefit me in anyway. But it's ok, it doesn't matter that I smoked one cig, I just need to keep going. Think about how I'll feel at a month. One cig in a month. I'm a non-smoker!

But no, that one cigarette wasn't going to let me off easy. It filled me with guilt and told me I had to reset my clock. So depressing. Well, since I'm resetting it I might as well have ONE MORE CIGARETTE before I do.

But as you guessed, it wasn't just one more. And I woke up this morning with a burning throat and a clogged nose. I'm a piece of shit. I failed myself and I failed my baby. Why the FUCK did I convince myself to have ""just one"" after a week? Why? For what purpose? And here I am. I'm in it to quit it this time guys. 10 hours in and NO MORE. I'm going to feel so good once this is behind me. 

Please, for the love of whatever the fuck you believe in, do NOT convince yourself that you can have just one cig. Keep your streak going. Do not fall into the trap. I believe in you. After one week I could breathe so good and I didn't get out of breath by walking up a tiny hill or stairs or anything. I had so much energy. I smelled so fucking good. I smoked 4 cigs a day the past two days and I feel like shit. I can't breathe. My head feels foggy. Plus the guilt. 

Fuck this, fuck cigarettes, fuck everything. I QUIT. No more. I think it helped typing my feelings out. Thanks guys. I can do this and you can too. We are strong!",23

It was SO SO hard. I smoked for 8 years before that, pack+/day . It occurred to me last week that I’ve been a non-smoker now for as long as I was a smoker. 

I want to tell you that the desire and mental cravings go away completely. But it doesn’t. I still want a cigarette, like a LOT, regularly.
I’ve actually had a couple drags from someone else’s cigarette, maybe 1/year when I’ve been drinking and it seems enticing and like a good idea. It’s never as satisfying as I remember it being when I was a smoker, in fact it disgusts me and I stop immediately and want to brush my teeth to get the taste out of my mouth.
So what is it that I still crave?
I miss that first rush of nicotine, the relief and momentary de-stress. I miss the rituals. Getting in the car, rolling down the window halfway and lighting a cigarette.

I guess the biggest thing I’ve learned is that I’ll always miss it, to a certain extent. But ultimately, that the benefits outweigh the feelings of missing it... 
and I know I never want to be dependent on that cost of buying a pack a day, and the discomfort when you run out at an inopportune time.
Positives:
I can run, with only minor asthma attacks instead of severe.
I can play with my kids and feel like I’m not modeling a bad habit.
My nails, teeth, skin, hair are all so much healthier. Probably smell better too not being in a cloud of smoke regularly.
Food tastes better.
I’m not a slave to finding a smoking section everywhere I go, though I still make a mental note of where they are without even realizing it. Smokers, ask me where to go and I’ll let you know lol

Anyways I don’t know why I’m writing this. Just to give encouragement I guess. Don’t think you can’t do it, even when you feel like the cravings won’t subside so what’s the point. Because while some things may stick with you, there’s way more benefits and every day that you don’t smoke, you learn to live without them.",36

I had my first smoke when I was 27, during a brief phase when I tried alllll the drugs, and I hated it. When I was 34, I started dating a guy who was a smoker. He was a serious drug addict and drinker in his teens but was 20+ years sober when we got together - except for the cigs. I started bumming them from him when I started law school at 35, just one or two here or there.  A decade later and I smoke to cope with the stresses of being a lawyer for “the little guy” - civil rights and discrimination cases - while my ex has since quit after smoking for over 30 years.

I used to be the one who could take it or leave it, who could smoke a few and then put them down for weeks or months, but now I admit I’m addicted. My stressful job and COVID lockdowns haven’t helped. Although I did my best to hide the smoking from my current partner, he finally (inevitably) caught me and I am wallowing in shame from that.

Who starts smoking at 35? Who descends into addiction during their 40s? Reader, it is I. I’m 49 now and don’t want to be smoking when I’m 50.

Currently going to Pulmonary Rehab and exercising, I’ve increased the workload on the Nu-Step machine, and I’m not so intimidated by the treadmill. I actually can’t imagine wanting a cigarette, which feels really weird because I smoked over 45 years. 

I’ll just go with appreciation for where I am now and keep doing what I’m doing to not smoke those nasty cancer sticks! Idk, addiction is insanity, and I’m well aware it can creep back up on me. I already lost most of my right lung to Lung cancer, can’t afford to lose  anymore.

2020-06-12 14:53:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/h7qpvq/quit_smoking_two_weeks_ago/,Quit smoking two weeks ago,"Hey everyone. I quit smoking 15 days ago, cold turkey. Haven’t smoked anything. I didn’t drink a ton before but I’ve cut drinking down and in the last two weeks have had three glasses of wine over two separate instances.   I’ve only really tried to quit maybe four times and I’ve smoked for 17 years.  Looks like I’m considered a light smoker though, probably on the heavier side of that. 

This attempt to quit smoking was the easiest of my life.  Barely any discomfort this time around.  Some headaches at days three and four. Fatigue for sure.  Perhaps an increase in muscle tension and pain in the neck and jaw due to stopping self medicating. Ringing of the ear and crepitus behind the ear so maybe tmj. 

I’m worried though because I’m at two weeks and have pretty severe intermittent fatigue.  Today I started getting some dizziness.  Pretty much everything says symptoms of withdrawal should be mostly resolved by day five.  I’m feeling pretty bad and worried I have cancer already.  Not a good time to get sick with the corona limiting access to medical services. I’m guess I’m worried that tobacco and alcohol suppressed latent symptoms and that I’m experiencing my true baseline which is terrifying because while I hold tension in my neck muscles what if I have cancer in the neck? Oh yeah no weight gain. In fact some weight loss. I’m definitely gonna write my doctor this weekend asking for labs and describing in detail my symptoms so I will look into it. 

Maybe this is kind of rambling, but I would like to learn more about delayed symptoms of withdrawal.  Is it even a real thing?  I hear testimonials about it on forums such as this,  but the medical literature I’ve found says it last 3-5 days as the worst and at two weeks only now starting to really feel like total crap.   I’m not depressed, I had a six year depressive episode a decade ago and honestly I feel mentally sound this time. Not irritable, not anxious. Definitely stressed though. I mean, look at the world. 

I’d just love to hear insight, advice, and recommendations.  Is it normal for the worst to occur weeks out?",6
2020-06-12 14:29:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/h7q9h8/ya_gotta_stop_social_smoking_too/,Ya Gotta Stop Social Smoking Too,"I started smoking when I was 14. It wasn’t an immediate pack per day habit, just a few when I could sneak out here and there. But then when I turned 18, I became closer to that. Then I started my first real job at 19, and I became a true pack a day smoker until last September when I was 25. I moved houses and quit smoking cold turkey just like that. Well, I quit smoking at home; I would still smoke when out with my friends. It was actually pretty easy to make the transition.

Until my birthday came in February and I smoked at home for the first time. I’ve been struggling since then. I think the quarantine made it harder because I had nothing to do but sit at home and stew over it, but unfortunately I slowly worked my way back up to a pack a day habit. 5 days ago, though, I told myself I was done and I haven’t smoked since.

Then today, I had a drink and thought “I mean I’ve been drinking I can smoke while I drink, right? That worked out last time.” But the problem is there are studies out there that say social smokers actually have just as hard of a time quitting, if not a HARDER time because they think of themselves as a non-smoker, so no one offers them any guidance or assistance (like their doctor) and they continue to think they don’t have any problems or health risks. In reality, a social smoker is just as likely to suffer from heart disease, and although the risk isn’t as high as a pack-a-day smoker, they still triple their risk of lung cancer.

So what I’m saying is: if you’re someone trying to quit smoking, don’t be like me and probably countless of other people in the world. Don’t say you’ll only smoke on weekends or with alcohol/friends, because you’re actually only making it more likely that you will A) never truly be smoke-free, and B) pick up the pack-a-day habit right back up at some point.

I told myself for these past five days that I was gonna go back to not smoking at home, but could still smoke when I went out. But after reading all the stuff I read today, I know that goal isn’t enough and I need to work every day at being smoke-free period.

Good luck everyone!",2

First, thanks for this community. Looking at it helped me overcome a lot of cravings. I WAS a smoker for ten years, one pack a day, and I am proud to say it will be one-month i stopped in two days!

My app asked me to share my tips (which I think is a good idea) to stop smoking.

My best one was : EAT. EAT. EAT. I ate so many sweets and cakes, I put on 3kgs but it was worth it. Yes, it's not healthy. But it's just for some time to resist the cravings :) treat yourselves during thIS hard time! BONUS: After around a week, you will recover your taste and it will be so good! 

Also, I isolated myself and I removed all the cigarettes lighter ash trays... With no way to smoke immediately. I didn't go out (well there was a lockdown) to not be tempted. 

I don't have much more, I wish you all good luck you can do it! 

And remember, as the coach says, ""NOT ANOTHER PUFF, NO MATTER WHAT!""",21
2020-06-12 14:11:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/h7pxex/please_read_my_1st_and_final_how_i_quit/,"PLEASE READ My 1st and Final ""How I Quit Permanently"" Post!","I began smoking cigars at age 38 to ""fit in"" with my executive crowd.  I tried cigarettes as a kid and as the son of two smokers in the early 1970s.  I also tried Skoal smokeless tobacco a few times. Cigars were a ""luxury"" and ""high class"".  The first ones left me woozy, jittery and sick feeling.  It really did take effort to ""enjoy"" them, but they stuck.

Fast forward 20 years of daily cigar smoking at increasing levels, and my last couple years I was CHAIN smoking 7-9 large cigars per day, each with the nicotine of more than a pack of cigarettes.  Sure, I didn't inhale, and maybe inhaling addicts quicker, and it certainly soils the lungs more. But nicotine is nicotine.

I was spending $40 to $50 per DAY at the end. I got very anxious if I even ran low on cigars. Tight chest and brain fog set in if I went more than a couple hours without smoking.  I stocked up dozens of them before any vacation or away trip.  I smoked starting at my 6:00 am work start while I mostly worked from home.  My last cigar was after supper and a couple hours before bed. Toward the end I had regular headaches, frequent bronchitis, and shortness of breath constantly that would even prevent me from sleeping. I bought a Pulse Oximeter to measure blood oxygen and after waking up gasping would measure it.  I have sleep apnea.

I'm an accountant and CPA.  I can't be hypnotized. Having been a forensic auditor I'm not easily swayed by suggestion.  I require evidence. I do respect the training and experience of experts in their field and like most professionals I know I need to trust their expertise as part of my work.

**After I quit on 5.5.2020 I felt the need to hit every post in this sub and make a suggestion based on what worked for me.  I'm done with that.  I have no need to come here for support, nor do I need an app to count my success. My brain was rewired to understand my addiction and hit it head on.  I instantly had no desire to smoke.**  I understand my withdrawal symptoms while noticeable, were only mild aggravations that my addiction caused. My main symptoms were brain fog and chest tightness, likely from anxiety.  They were mild once I understood they were a good sign.  I have a deep knowledge and feeling that my lack of desire to smoke is permanent.  It's hard to explain, but it's like gravity.  I know it, believe it, and no longer need to prove it.

Then one day a fellow Garmin lover over the the Garmin watch sub mentioned his improvement in running.  He mentioned he had recently quit smoking permanently.  I asked how and he told me about a book.

Let me tell you about Allen Carr.  He was a chartered accountant, the UK equivalent of my CPA.  Maybe that's why I was interested in reading his ""Easy Way"" book.  I read it in about 5 hours-not a long book.  I believed his experience along with the experts he worked with.  Even though HE was cured by HYPNOTHERAPY and NOT his own method, his method is based on the principles of hypnotherapy. I was done smoking after ""Easy Way"", but I had a few expensive cigars left, so I read ""The Only Way to Stop Smoking Permanently"" since he encourages you to smoke while reading-probably to be sure he has your attention.....lol.  It's like 4 times as long as ""Easy Way"", expands on some examples and principles and is just as repetitive as Easy Way.  His method educates you and helps rewire your thinking to take on the 99% of nicotine addiction which is MENTAL.  It is NOT a will power method, and he explains why the will power method does not work.

I'm still around all the triggers I had while smoking. Work stress, boredom, food, sex, waking up in the am are all still there.  I still think about smoking--a lot at first and less now.  He explains why that is good and encouraged. Like many I dream about smoking.  Funny how I never did until I quit.

If you haven't read Allen Carr's book, I encourage you to spend the $10. Tried it and it didn't work for you?  Fine.  I have nothing to prove and only offer myself as a difficult case with overwhelming first time success.

Good luck and good future.",9

2020-06-12 02:51:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/h7fr6k/keep_these_doggies_rollin/,Keep these doggies rollin',"So I'm 7 days and 7 hours into not smoking. I think this is the 4th time I've stopped over the course of 16 years. Once in 2007, 2009, 2012 and for a few months last year. Wow, it always seems impossible until I do it. Of course the trick now is to stay the course and not slowly drown in despair for the quick relief that nicotine can (very temporarily) provide. It's such a painfully disgusting habit. The only reason I've gotten this far is because I'm in (14 day) quarantine and barely skirted the intense draw to buy a pack of smokes before starting. After getting through the first few days I wondered (as usual) what took me so long. I guess I have poor impulse control. I've had heart problems this year, I'm ashamed to admit and sometimes smoking was the only thing that calmed my anxiety, even though it made my chest tighter. My relationship with tobacco has taken many forms... originally I got hooked by mixing it with weed, got really into strong shwag... rolled my own for a while... and then wound up living in a country where I could buy a pack of lucky strikes for less than $3. Every time I quit I feel like I'm losing a friend. I went 6 months smoke free when I was 19 but eventually got depressed and relapsed. I was actually doing pretty well in school at the time but couldn't handle the tedium and boredom. The physical addiction can be oh-so hard when you're smoking all the time, but the really tough hoop to jump is knowing that ongoing, forever, the next hit won't be there, that the fall back isn't there, that subtle grind week after week. Whenever I've relapsed it starts slow, but just knowing that poison is waiting would be what would keep me afloat. Once a month becomes once a day which becomes once an hour, like a vice grip slowly cinching. It feels like being stuck to a spiders web, surrendered yet comfortable and familiar with the fangs sunk deep into your neck. I don't know how to be a non-smoker entirely yet, but I'm determined to keep going. So far I've been getting grumpy and a bit jumpy but I passed through the white knuckle phase OK; probably because I had been slowing down prior to now. Yeesh sorry I just wanted to rant a bit. And thank you to this subreddit, I've only been here a few weeks but it's given me a lot of strength to read the posts, makes me feel a lot less alone. KEEP UP THE HARD FOUGHT WIN. The biggest challenge is to keep reminding myself that this hole wasn't easy to get out of and is NOT WORTH GIVING UP FOR THAT NEXT PUFF OF TAR. This damn drug has killed family members, and I've had to watch my dad struggle with it my whole life. I know that I'll probably always want one when I see a friend smoking, tv, etc, but I think after wasting so many years chained to the habit surely this time I'll keep my hand out of the cookie jar. I'm going to thank tobacco for all it's given me and let it go. Finally. Knowing ahead that there may come an emotional fall out down line helps me brace for that coming wave. No more arsenic, no more paint-thinner, no more garbage lungs, racing pulse, yellow fingers, spitting and wheezing, please.. it's too slow a death to succumb to.

Much love, stay strong, unity",7

I guess I’ve been smoking for about 20 years. This is the fourth time in my life that I’ve just gotten tired of it and decided to stop. Being stinky, feeling winded going up stairs, etc. Maybe you know what I mean, you just wake up and enough is enough. 

The first time I quit, I just quit. Then stress from school brought me back. The next two times I quit was with vaping. It made “quitting” extremely easy, but I never really felt like I was getting all of the health benefits from actually quitting nicotine all together. Eventually vaping becomes a hassle for me and I quit vaping for a short period of time before picking up smoking again. 

Now I’m in my mid-30s and this time I’ve decided to just put it all down and go nicotine-free. It’s harder but it feels right for me right now. It’s been about 25 hours since I had a cigarette. The day was really hard but much easier than I had built it up to be. I usually get cold symptoms when I quit and I can feel those starting up. But the worst part is just the constant nagging from my brain. That constant feeling of “you know what would be good right now?” Or just feeling like I was looking forward to doing something and then remembering that I can’t. It’s like having someone sit next to you for the entire day eating your favorite snack and offering you a bite but then telling you that you can’t have any. 

Anyway, I just wanted to make my presence known and establish a place to come and rant along my journey :) I’m blown away by how much time some of you have. Congrats! I’ll be there soon!",12

Every morning I wake up I say to myself that THIS is the day. But by the time I get to the kitchen my motivation disappears and I either find my dad there smoking with the coffee waiting for me or I'm on autopilot, make the coffee and start smoking. I say ok, I'll just smoke two and then that's it. But that never works and I keep smoking through the day.

- One is too many, one hundred is not enough.
- I’m a puff away from a pack a day.
- The cravings will pass whether you smoke or not.
- This too shall pass.
- I don’t smoke because I don’t smoke.
- One day at a time.
- Smoking is not an option.
- It’s a matter of life and death.
- The pain is temporary, the gain is permanent.

There have been a few deaths in the family and other accumulated garbage that put her in a rough mood. She wanted to lay in bed, cuddle and talk but all I wanted to do was grab my phone, coffee, and cigarettes and go outside to smoke and scroll on Reddit. I did stay in bed and talk with her for a while but I've never felt like more of a dirtbag. 

I told my best friend (also a redditor) and we agreed that tonight we would uninstall the app before bed. I don't remember my password so it'll be a full stop on my account. 

The world gives us innumerable reasons to quit smoking. Some of them are logical and some are emotional. Some may not affect you at all but some will be the profound reason you really grit your teeth and commit to trying to quit. I'm putting my whole ass into this attempt. I want to see 30 days on the clock. I'm tired of excusing myself from parties and dinners and missing time with my friends (none of my friends smoke). I'm tired of excusing myself from movie nights with my wife so I can ""go burn one"". I'm so sick and tired of the disappointment in my wife's eyes when I come home with a pack. I'm ashamed to be a smoker. 

This subreddit is, without a doubt, the most wholesome and nurturing environment I've seen on this site. There is no gatekeeping. I smoked a pack a day for 24 years and I get the same consideration as someone who smoked 2 cigarettes a day for the last 6 months. 

Keep at it and one day we'll all have more time, more money, and more breath.

I need some advice or suggestions please.  I'm not celebrating yet, I'm dying for a cigarette and doing everything I can to not smoke.  Oh I miss thee!

Anyways, need some suggestions from the group.  I Googled and didn't get a lot of assistance but my energy levels the past four days or so have tanked.  I'm so tired by 1-3 PM everyday and I definitely have ""brain fog"" during the second half of my workday.  

My two best friends were cigarettes and coffee so I've had to decrease my coffee intake so I don't have the crazy cravings.  I was having some pretty awful anxiety the past six weeks and I'm sure too much of both was contributing.   

Is there anything that can be done to avoid the midday crash?  I'm a little new to my city so I have to find a GP to talk to but until then, any help is appreciated.  Cheers!",7

I'm (26 M) who had an opportunity to taste the beauty of Ganja at age 18. I remember the first day I smoked bong at my friend's place while playing league of legends - it was so relaxing. Since that day, my mind and body slowly gave into the high and before I realized, I became its slave. 

I must admit, though I am writing this in hopes of ending my relationship with Ganja. It definitely helped me during the hardships I thought I couldn't overcome on my own. It also helped me bond more with my friends while playing games. During these years, I always thought my life would be under control while smoking daily. 

The voice inside of me began to echo louder 2 years ago when my mother's health condition worsened due to cancer. She was very young when she left the world and it broke my heart to pieces.

Had I not been so crazy about Ganja, perhaps I could have spent more time and gave more attention to my mother. I thought i tried my best and gave all while I was still with her. But the feeling of me wanting to do better always remained. 

I told myself I'd quit and become a better person, for myself and for my mother. Yet, soon after I found myself back with Ganja. 

Everyday, I became more depressed and not sure of myself. 

I am writing this to demand myself the best version of myself. I am sick and tired of smoking and get high. I am done stuffing myself with junk food and sleep so that I can wake up to repeat what I did for the past years. 

I want to be changed and become the best version of myself. My mother saw the best in me and trusted me to make the right decisions in my life. I want to be bold and brave. I want to stand strong and go after what I want in my life. The hunger in me is not over until I say its over. 

I want myself to be brave and stand up for what is not right in me. I do not want to waste this opportunity my mother had worked so hard to provide me for. I will not let her effort and belief in me go to waste. I will stand up and look up in the sky believing that God has plans for me.

I was once lost but now I am found. The lone sheep that went out on an adventure on its own found its way back home. 

The change has already begun in me.",1

Been lurking here for a couple of those years. Thank you all for sharing your successes, struggles and motivations. Here is a little on my story and strategy:

Quarantine and working from home had me hitting my vape constantly. Went back to smoking to cut down on nic. Then I switched to nicotine gum. Whenever I felt physically or mentally disabled by a craving, I made myself take gum instead of smoking. That was really the only rule I had for myself. It eliminated the craving and I could endure until the next urge peaked, then gum again.

The cravings pass. I understand it's easy to overthink things. But just remember that the cravings will pass.

Good luck, y'all.",1

As cliche as this phrase is,  mind over matter. You are stronger than addiction and realize the craving is temporary and will subside. 

Now that I quit, I will admit I'm guilty of having a few slip ups, only when drinking, or just getting cravings when I see someone smoking while at a bar.  Part of what helps me combat that is realizing that there is a reason I quit. If smoking wasn't bad, then there'd be no urge to quit in the first place. 

I've also created a mental list  of what I don't miss about smoking  to reaffirm my decision for quitting. Seems redundant but it really does help. But for starters, I won' miss

\-spending $14-16 a pack, which is what they cost in Chicago. It's really a blessing in disguise because at the time, me and my smoking friends complained, and would try to avoid buying cigarettes in the city so that actually worked. It led to cutting down. 

\-Going up to strangers and offering a dollar for a cigarette, in hopes of getting one when I didn't have my own pack. I'm not proud to admit this, but on my smoke breaks at work and commute to work, I would desperately go to smoking sections of nearby office buildings looking to find a cigarette. Some people would take me up on the offer or just give me one for free. But other times, some people would get really pissy despite offering a dollar. By no means did I get offended or feel entitled to their cigarettes, but when they got angry that I offered a dollar for a cigarette, it made me feel like a junkie  and a mooch.  That is one thing I will not miss. 

\-Hiding it from family members and dates who will see it as a dealbreaker. 

\-Going out for cigarettes in the freezing cold/rain. 

\-Wondering how many cigarettes I have and if I have enough to get me through the day.

\-The stress of should I smoke now or save them for when I go out. 

\-The stress of running out of cigarettes and wondering where I can buy a pack for the cheapest. 

\-Smelling like shit 

\-Running out of breath 

\-Anxieties of health issues. For example, if I got heartburn or chest pain of any kind, if it was from smoking.

\-Getting sick often. I noticed I'd get colds many times a year and my dumbass would continue to smoke while I was sick which only made it last longer and make the symptoms even worse. 

\-Lastly, the overall addictive aspect of it and feeling like I couldn't do certain things until I had a cigarette. It feels truly liberating.",17

It's been half a year since my birthday and no serious attempt has taken place, but two days ago, I gave my tobacco papes etc. to my roommate who keeps it from me. I just put together a cig out of tobacco-leftovers from the kitchen and smoked it.

 As uni hits hard this semester and I have to finish a lot of tasks, my brain tells me that I need the nicotine to get to work and I have tricked myself in this way the last two days also. Still it feels like a victory, because I'm down from 10-15 cigs a day to only 1 (and a joint in the evening). Can you give me some advice on how to stay better focused during study time, when usually while not feeling motivated enough, I smoke to get started or smoke during learning, to feel less bored?

 I think, I maybe should try to quit during vacations, when it's not important to be focused and I can handle craving and being nervous. But then I also don't want to loose this opportunity of having one of my first serious attempts rn and go on with the momentum.

I'm worried about the side effects of quitting... Mostly the lack of sleep for the first week or so as that is my Achilles heel... Any tips for dealing with that would also be beneficial. 

Also as an FYI.. I am already on antidepressants so taking Cipralex or Wellbutrin isn't a possibility.. I've been on them in the past for depression and I have had adverse reactions.

I keep struggling with that feeling. No, I don't want a cigarette, but I NEED something to appease that hunger and NRT gum/lozenges don't scratch the itch. I have a long list of distractions and coping mechanisms. They help with the withdrawal but they don't really satiate the hunger. 

That being said I hit 15 days today and bought cigarettes due to muscle memory. Drinking makes me want a cigarette a little but buying beer and cigarettes together is an immediate reflex reaction.

Starting yesterday, I've developed a very mild sore throat that seems to be lingering and a brain fog/mild headache/head fullness that likes to rear its head at times making it difficult to concentrate. 

The same thing happened when I quit years ago. Best way to describe it is it's like a second wave of craving or cessation symptoms. Anyone else get this at around this stage or is it just me?",5

First half on tobacco and second half on e-cigs. Most recently it's been 3% Juul pods and going through 1 a day.

I also live in a citu where selling any e-cig juice is banned so I have to take an Uber to a neighboring city to restock. (Thankfully, I'm done with smoking tobacco and never intend to go back)

I ran out of juice the other day and at first I planned to find time to restock. I went 7 hours without Juul and realized I felt kind of good. I felt calmer and focused. Maybe it was coincidence, but it stopped me from restocking. I had then decided to quit.

Next three days, I dug through old pods (probably 2-3 times a day) to find even just a drop of nicotine. Such little amounts that I don't think it constitutes to even a full inhalation from a single puff. Today is the fourth day and there is literally nothing left. It's been over 18 hours with 0 nicotine and almost 4 days without even a full puff on the Juul. 

The problem is the depression and loneliness. Every time I want to reach out for my Juul, it hits me and I get especially sad. This feeling lasts throughout the day and it's making me question my decision to quit. Why am I quitting so dramatically when the withdrawals make me feel so bad? What's worse - Juul or depression? Should I try again later, when we no longer have to social distance and I can get more daily distractions to help with the quitting?

I feel very helpless right now to the verge of tears because I don't know if I can do this. I feel like if I stick to it then I could possibly succeed, but if I have to keep feeling this level of depression then I'm not sure if it's worth it.

Sorry, bit of venting. Any advice on the depression or more reasons to quit (hence boosting my willpower) would be greatly appreciated.",3

* I am fet boi. I can eat all the time, and I do. How long can I expect to have this level of appetite? Is it my body overreacting to the absence of stimulants, or is this my life now?
* I am coughing up grayish green tar, frequently in little bits. My chest is also sore, especially in the bronchi but sometimes it hurts when I breathe deeply in other places when my chest is contorted (eg, reading on my side in bed). Are these symptoms normal? Is it normal for them to happen 3 months after quitting? What's the usual time frame for these symptoms?
* My sleep is messed up. I'm getting 9-10 hours of shallow, unfulfilling sleep a night.
* My depression has gotten a lot worse. I acknowledge that this can be because of quarantine, or current events in Seattle breaking my heart. I'm curious if quitting smoking is linked to this, or exacerbating it in any way or not.

yes. Nicotine, like other stimulants, is a “study drug” that increases performance on certain cognitive tasks. It also helps one deal with boredom. Nicotine is frequently used for its performance-enhancing effects on cognition, alertness, and focus.

Smoking calms you down. ... Smoking and depression have a well-established and consistent link. According to the CDC, people with depression smoke at higher rates, smoke more, and are less likely to quit than people without depression.",3

I quit smoking on may 25, 2019. Cold turkey after reading Allen Carr’s book. I’ve gone through the motions of kicking my addiction and still do. Since then I’ve-
Bought a house and moved 
Lost 2 jobs- 1 from downsizing 1 from Covid
Had numerous family fights
Worked months of overtime at a highly stressful job
Broke my ankle on Christmas morning
Spent 5 weeks apart from my husband while he traveled for work
Quarantined for 2 months
Depression from unemployment
Nationwide rioting 
Isolation
Hormonal changes 
Housed a family member for months unexpectedly 
Countless phone calls put in hold countless times stuck in a line somewhere 

My life isn’t normally like this, it was just a year of exponential growth...and after 11 years of smoking, one of the most stressful years of my life was done smoke free. 
My biggest fear before quitting was how would I deal with stress without a cig? But all of those stressful scenarios I’ve just felt with were without nicotine, how can that be? I believe all of those fears I had before putting out my last smoke were...just smoke. I still find myself occasionally craving it, but the truth is out now. All the fears I had of life without a cig were only being caused by the cig itself (and years of habit forming) 
Anywho, I feel better now that’s down in words.  All of the pressure I’ve felt over the last year is like steam building up ready to blow.

\- you can mimic the breathing (inhaling) and deep breathing is good for you.

I’ve had year gaps and month gaps, only smoke when I drink gaps, only smoking a few a day gaps etc all the excuses. 
Whenever there is something particularly stressful in my life, it’s smokes that I reach for instinctively. And then I have that usual fight of “well you shouldn’t be smoking” with myself and I normally give in and buy a small pack because the cravings get really strong and I just want to calm down. 


There’s some things in my life right now that have caused me pretty intense stress, one is my mother having terminal cancer. You’d think what she is going through would make me not want to touch them, and it’s true I don’t! But in that moment when I am that stressed the craving gets so intense for one, it’s all I want. It’s also an excuse to just escape the situation for a moment, to set myself aside and just smoke. It works. Not because of the nature of the cigarette, but because it eases my craving that is tied to my stress, coupled with me simply moving myself out of a situation and calming down.


I don’t want to smoke at all guys. I don’t want my stress response to be tied to this shit. I call myself a non smoker because I only smoke occasionally and pretend to be in control but it’s completely untrue. It’s an urge I give in to. I need to quit completely and stop kidding myself. I had a moment last night and went and got smokes. I do want one now because I have them, but won’t.

I’m new here 😊 Was a smoker for 22 years, I’m on Day 19 Quit!  I quit after my sister found out she had the onset of emphysema (age 37), I didn’t want her to quit alone...plus emphysema scares me too. 

I thought I’d try sleep hypnosis (in earphones)...I needed anything to help. After night 1, I had 3 cigs that day. After night 2, I was having puffs just because it was weird not to. By that night I felt so sick that I could no longer smoke. I listened to it for 2 weeks every night. And have otherwise gone Cold Turkey. No withdrawals, and very little cravings. I truly believe this worked & I was sceptical.

I genuinely thought it had been easy up until now but recently everytime I hang out with either of my coworkers I feel like I'm just one moment of weakness away from asking for a cigarette myself.

Do you think I should just avoid them for now until my body's forgot about nicotine even more or should I just try one to hopefully remind myself of how pointless smoking is? The latter sounds like a shitty strategy but this is only my 2nd time quitting in 6 years of smoking so what do I know?",2

I would like to start off by saying how proud I am of EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU! No matter what stage of quitting you are in, you are doing the right thing, and you WILL succeed! The thing about quitting nicotine products is...every victory AND every setback is a step forward. You either accomplish a goal or learn from mistakes you made so that you are one step closer to accomplishing that same goal. I continue to be in awe of the intrepid masses that make the decision to vanquish such a formidable enemy.

As you can probably surmise with a quick look at my user name, I am involved with tobacco prevention. What may not be as obvious, is that I also function in the additional capacities of: nicotine cessation, education, and chronic disease prevention at the state level here in the United States.

I have, unfortunately, personally experienced the depths of the 'rabbit hole' of nicotine addiction, as well as the deleterious effects of smoking and addiction on my body as a result thereof. The good news...I have now been tobacco/nicotine free for 10 years! (which I am very proud of)

My interest in joining this subreddit is threefold. 1) It is my hope that I can engage with tobacco/nicotine users of all ages and backgrounds in an attempt to better understand addiction-based loyalty, as well as the psychological personal-identification loyalty exhibited by people in this specific population, from multiple different points of view. 2) To speak openly and honestly with people about their background, history of nicotine use (various forms), motivation, product-seeking behavior, life stressors, health, and explore their mentality when it comes to planning for the future. 3) To educate interested parties in the specific biological, physiological, and psychological aspects of nicotine addiction that do not appear to be common knowledge.

The fact that you are even taking the time to read this post is indicative of the fact that you are a thoughtful and curious person. Perhaps that curiosity is exactly what led you to check out tobacco/nicotine products in the first place. I understand that mentality.

I would like to continue to broaden my understanding of the lives and motivations of tobacco/nicotine users. Full disclosure: it will be my intention to use any information gleaned from you fine people to design educational programs to help make sure that young people never start smoking or using aerosolized nicotine products, otherwise known as electronic nicotine deliver systems. I will also use this information to help others who are struggling to quit this powerfully addicting drug.

You may, by proxy, be able to help hundreds or thousands of people live happier, healthier lives with the input that you choose to share with me on this subreddit, if you choose to do so. Regardless of how much information you decide to volunteer to help me understand and plan for the future, I am still grateful to you for reading this and sharing it to others in the community who may be willing and able to provide unique and valuable insight. Although we experience addiction in similar ways, we all have a very unique relationship with our addiction as well. Please help me understand this from your specific cultural, ethnic, economic, psychological, and/or geographical perspective. Many thanks in advance!

For those interested: I would love to know about your specific background with tobacco or nicotine. Please take your time and be as specific as possible. Feel free to talk about how you feel about the use of these products as well. This does not need to be all hard facts, dates and timelines. The way we feel about these products in incredibly important. I look forward to reading about your experiences. Take care!",3

I quit on June 4th/2020 on what SHOULD have been my 5th smoke free anniversary.
I hate myself for the relapse, I cried when I officially cleared my smoke free app. 
Then because of that i felt it was pointless to quit again, I lost the 3 years i worked so hard for. Recently I  have been feeling all the symptoms that caused me to quit in the first place and it reminded me why i wanted to do this again. I'm a closet smoker these days due to the embarrassment of relapse, so I only do it alone and its exhausting trying to hide it.
So, here I am again. Day 4... cold turkey again! For the 3rd time in my life 🤦‍♀️
Hoping the kids get along today because i don't know if i can handle it any other way 😅
I just needed to vent a little bit.  Thanks for listening",29

Been lurking on this sub ever since my last genuine cold-turkey quit attempt six years ago which lasted about a year... I relapsed briefly, then was addicted to nicotine gum for a good three years, until ultimately falling fully off the wagon earlier this year.. I haven't done much preparation for this, but after realising that I've spent more of my life as a smoker than a non-smoker, this needs to end.. Will be taking each craving as it comes, aware that is will pass, and fully aware of my triggers so that I can avoid them as best I can in these first few weeks. Will be looking to all of you occasionally for support.. The biggest motivator for me is to finally regain my independence, to be fully autonomous again after letting this drug run my shit for so long.. 

Any final advice or words of encouragement as I embark on this journey would be greatly appreciated!",1

I've been lurking here for a while. Probably joined years ago. Lately since the recent health crisis and with a lot of extra time I've been looking into ways to improve my life physically. Great news is - I am a sober alcoholic and will have 4 years of sobriety in August. So! I've quit something addictive before (and something that destroyed my life), *but I have this paralyzing fear of letting go of smoking.*

&#x200B;

I've tried to quit a couple of times (I've been smoking since I was 16, am now 33). I gave it one serious attempt and used nicotine replacement therapy (under the care of my doctor). I can't even remember why I picked up again. 

&#x200B;

So basically here I am, realizing more and more and more how cigarettes are ruining my life. Intellectually I ***KNOW*** that this is terrible and killing me and gross and ya... the list goes on. However, when I think ahead to trying to picture my life without cigarettes I just don't know how. They are my little escape, something that is my ""dealing with stress tool belt"" and I use regularly. Anyway, any advice you guys have is so appreciated. I would love to try the 12 Step approach toward quitting (heck I've used it for things other than alcohol before), but I am so scared even to try! I don't want to fail.

&#x200B;

Other important notes: I live in Mexico so I have no idea what the cost of quitting looks like (cigarettes are so cheap here). The reason I was able to quit was that I was living in Canada and the NRT was covered.

2020-06-07 16:24:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/gyjpr4/smoking_does_not_relieve_stress_if_anything_it/,"Smoking does NOT relieve stress. If anything, it adds more.","If there's anything I've noticed let alone learned after I quit smoking is that smoking does not relieve stress, but only adds more.

I can't speak for everyone here, but I know a lot of people including myself have told others and ourselves the lie that we smoke because it helps us relieve stress. That's one way the brain tricks you into staying addicted. If anything, that ""stress"" is the stress of wanting a cigarette aka when you experience nicotine withdrawl. Even if it may relieve stress and calms down your nerves, it only does so temporarily. Whatever caused you said stress does not go away after a cigarette.

For example, a few years ago, I dated some girl who ended up being super toxic and used me as a rebound. Before it ended as a disaster, I was cutting down and then after I got hurt, I was smoking a few packs a week. I used smoking as a crutch and you know what? All that did was make me more addicted to cigarettes. I was hurting so bad (mentally), that it got to a point where I was at a concert and would go out during a band's set (even if I really liked them) to smoke. Whenever I wasn't smoking, the anxiety and depression of being rebounded and gaslighted was still there and lasted for months.

Also, even when I slowed down a year or two later, being a regular smoker had its own stresses. Usually it was the stress of how many do I have left? Should I smoke or should I save it? When and where can I smoke next? Who sells them for the cheapest? Will someone sell me one for a dollar when  i run out? And so on.

I know I'm over analyzing the hell out of this, but looking back at my smoking days, this helps put things into perspective and ultimately makes me happier that I'm off these damn things as I no longer have these thoughts. Right now, the only trigger I have to fight with cravings is when I'm drinking with friends who smoke and I'm getting better with that.

I mean when you come to think about it, there are tons of people who get stressed that don't/never smoked and use other ways to cope with stress. Not to mention that no one is born a smoker. We were all non-smokers before we started and did just fine without them. ",39

Well, bullshit.

It's almost half a year since I quit and I still miss it. I really liked smoking. The whole ritual, the social interactions with other smokers during events, all of it. If smoking was cost free and not harmful to my body - I would have been smoking still. 

And it's the same with sweets, video games, soda, coffee and few other things. I probably do too much of them, which is harmful in one way or another, but noone is ever going to try force an opinion on me that ""hey, /u/YachiyoTodorki, you never really liked chocolate to begin with, you were manipulated into liking it!"". Of course, addiction is a rather heavy and complicated subject, but I also feel like Allen Carr's books are on the opposite spectrum, being almost childish in their rhetoric.

I still remember I smoked my first cigarette back in 2006 in my first varsity year, I had a bad breakup with my girlfriend which I was dating for 6 years. That where it all started. It wasn’t one cigarette, it was three in a row as this friend (not really my friend, it was hers, I just don’t know why she came to me) says you will feel better after you smoke this and yeah, that where it all started, I started doing all sort of cigarette, Marlboro, camel, Dunhill and so, went from a few slowly picking up to one pack per day, sometimes when I’m with my friends chilling, it goes up to two packs. At one stage, I had very bad coughs every morning I wake up. That is the time when I decided maybe I should stop with the cigarette and switch, so during that time, vaping was the best alternative. So there I went, vaping was ok but it did not stop the craving of cigarette for me, I remember when I started vaping, my cigarette count per day went down to three, which is very good. So that carried on for some time, but eventually I went back to cigarette, because I think that vaping doesn’t give me that hit in the throat, so turns out It didn’t work for me.

So in 2013, my friend borrowed me one of his book(I’m not gonna mention the book’s name, don’t want to make it like a paid promotion or something) and said it helped him quit smoking(a smoker, who started in high school and continued for 15+ years), he told me: you’ve got nothing to lose,read it, if it works for you, good, if it doesn’t, you just back to your normal life. Haha to be honest, I’m very skeptical about it. So I started a few pages, I think after 20 odd pages, I stopped (the book only has 119 pages I think), during the time reading it, smoking continued and that where the book started catching dust again.

I’m always seeking alternatives, this one time, while traveling overseas, a friend was smoking this weird device, I asked him what is it, is it good? IQOS it is, I asked him if I could have a session on it and I did, hmmm... not bad at all, it actually get the crave away and that when I started with IQOS. When I got back to South Africa, I bought a device and started with my IQOS journey, at the place I stay, we don’t have much supply of the heet sticks, so every time when we go to the bigger cities, I buy cartons and cartons of supplies fearing if I don’t, I would run out and start panicking as I don’t want to go back to normal cigarette. So IQOS went on for 3 to 4 years and everyday i smoke about 15 heet sticks per day, that actually help with cough, didn’t have those bad cough for a long time.

This year, we had the corona virus outbreak, it came into our country in March. On 23 March, our president announced that we will be going into lockdown in 4 days time and said it will be for three weeks(with the banning of tobacco and alcohol products under lock down) So during that time, I thought, yeah my IQOS supply was enough so I wouldn’t bother, I can just buy it after the lockdown. After the second week of lockdown, the president announced that the lock down will be extended until end of April, that is when I started panicking, I went to an uncle who smokes cigarette and asked him if he got a carton for me, luckily he is a heavy smoker and he keeps a lot of Supplies and there we go, I started smoking regular cigarette again.

During the lockdown, I started reading the book again after leaving it there for 6 years, while smoking, I progressed slowly. My wife and my parent says it a good time to quit, because from what they know, my IQOS supplies are finished, but little did they know, I went back to regular cigarette and started smoking secretly. So on 27 of May 2020, i had like a pack of 20s left, the panicking started again, went to my uncle again, asked him if he has some cigarette for me, he says because of the lock down regulations, it not easy to get, but if he doesn’t get it, he will tell me. I didn’t like what I was doing, it feels like I am begging for it. That the moment when I told myself, I should quit and not be controlled by nicotine. So I carried on smoking my last 20 pack and continued reading the book. That’s it, on a beautiful Sunday morning of the 31st of May,
 At 9 o’clock, I lit my last cigarette, told myself that it, it the last cigarette and after this, I’m done and don’t want be a beggar anymore. That it, a whole week has passed, I did not breath in anything either than fresh air.

My approach to the book, have the mentality of wanting to quit first, then read it, if you not interesting in quitting, then there is no point of reading it. I did not bother to quit in the last six years, so I didn’t even bother reading it. The books helps a lot with avoiding getting back into the nicotine trap and that why I’m so glad I read it. I want to quote what my friend told me, you’ve got nothing to lose, if it works for you, good, if it doesn’t, then you just back to normal, the only thing you lose is a few hours of readying. So that would be my advice as well.

Regarding my body for the 7 days, I don’t have morning coughs anymore, I wake up fresher every morning and I breath better now. I still have the craves at the critical moment, like the morning cigarette, cigarette after meals, while I’m in the toilet and chatting with friends, these are when the craves hit badly, but the only way I tell myself is that I already decided to quit so never look back. The book helps in this regard with some things that changes your mentality.

That’s it, my story of my smoking journey, thank you for spending your time reading, wishes everyone who wants to quit succeed!",12

Over the past week or so I've been cutting down, but I've never made it past 5 cigarettes a day before. When I did go cold turkey, all I thought about was smoking. When I caved and started again, I'd hide it from people like it was my dirty little secret, which it was!

But this week has been a real turning point. I really don't want to smoke. I made myself have a couple yesterday, thinking that it will be easier mentally to taper off, but I ended up feeling really sick and not finishing any of my cigarettes.

I know this is only day one so I don't want to jump to conclusions and start celebrating but I really feel like this time, I'm a non smoker.

My box of cigarettes the corner of it poked me in the leg and I (over dramatically, cause I like my pot in edible form) rolled around on the ground for a sec clutching my leg kinda leg that one episode from family guy. Then I got up and sat back down on the bench and just sat there like why the fuck do I smoke, pardon the bad word. Like it's so dumb and the cig box +lighter take up like a pocket and a half. 

So now I'm sitting on the bench enjoying the view and finish a cig and thinking this should be the last cigarette I. Ever. Have.

Dunno though, sorry for the rant little high atm and seriously considering smoking.

This is, I think, my fifth time trying to quit smoking. I’ve been smoking about 18 cigarettes a day since January 2018.

I’ve always found that I tend to smoke more while at work, even though I work in an office job. Smoking allows me extra quick breaks from staring at a monitor.

Since going into lockdown mid-March, I’ve been able to cut down to currently rotating between 4-3 cigarettes a day (with vaping in between). My boyfriends been a tremendous help, and so has those fridge magnetics made for children. Those bright alphabetic and numeric magnets. Each morning we place numbers 1 through whatever my max daily allotment is on the fridge, and I’m responsible for removing them as I go through them. It helps me visualize what I have smoked and how many I have left. It’s helped to keep me accountable.

I’m estimating I have another month, maybe a month and a half til I’m completely cigarette free.",12

I \[24/M\] stopped smoking after I got the Diagnosis of High Blood Pressure at the beginning of the year after 9 years of smoking daily. The first days were terrible and I couldnt process what was happening to my brain at all. I couldnt focus, i was sad, i was angry and I knew that I needed something to cope with these feelings. I had a Breakup a few Weeks before that and I did not know how to handle all that. 

So I started to run and decided to be able to run a Half Marathon before I turn 25. After a lot of Training in the past few months and the bad news that there wont be Half marathons this year because of Corona I was able to run 19 Kilometers in 2 Hours today and I am really proud of myself. 

In two weeks, one day before my birthday I will run the Half marathon and celebrate my Life as a Nonsmoker. Even if the cravings are bad i know that I will take this accomplishment to cope with them and i can always go for a run. This would not be possible with my Lungs filled with smoke. 

Running really Helps !

Just wanted to share my progress it’s been 3 months today since I quit!

I used Champix/Chantix as my crutch and it has helped immensely.  I will say a few things about the tablets:

1. This is my second time using them, the first time I only did 1.5 months of the tablets and I was like “Grand, I’ve quit I don’t need these anymore” and went back smoking 2 weeks after that just at the 2 months mark.  Trust me just do the full 3 months of tablets.

2. People say they get weird dreams on it, I did get weirdish dreams but it was funny.  The dreams were usually: I’d smoke in the dream then in the dream I’d get annoyed at myself for smoking again and say grand I’ll start the tablets again tomorrow and quit again hahaha.  That was a reoccurring dream!

3. I suffer from Anxiety & OCD and have suffered from depression in the past.  I do think if people have suffered from depression in the past need to be careful on these tablets.  It may have been the smoking causing this but I was pretty low across the 3 months, my moods were up and down, I was tired, didn’t have much motivation to do other things.  Once I stopped taking them my moods were less to non existent.  My doctor knew of my past mental health and only gave me 1 month of the tablets at a time so I had to go back to him to monitor me.

4. Try it!  If you feel cold turkey is too much and are not bothered with NRT go to your doctor and ask about it.  May not agree with everybody but personally if I ever unfortunately go back smoking I know champix/Chantix works for me.

5. The tablets may feel expensive.  Where I live the tablets are 110€ a pack but I smoke 150€ worth of cigarettes a month so I was even saving 40€ taking the tablets and now I’m finished the tablets I’m saving 150€.  It just feels a lot because you usually wouldn’t buy 110€ worth of cigarettes up front!

6. I had little to no cravings.  The first day I had loads 10-15+ but they weren’t too bad they were just quick passing, annoying ones.  After that the first month I averaged out to 4 a day and they were very manageable with chewing gum or something small like that to distract.  After the first month I didn’t really get any.  Today when I walk by a smoker I smell it and think oh smoke!  But then I’m like nah I’m not a smoker and the craving is gone.

If you have any questions about the tablets ask!  Be more than happy to answer!

Thanks!",2

Typically I would love to escape for 5 minutes to go smoke. In the past, the fear of others judging me coming back smelling like a cigarette was worth the risk. I’d wash my hands, spirit some cologne, nobody would notice. But people didn’t care that I smoked as much as I did. I knew I needed to want to quit more than they wanted me to quit. 

So today, when I got that text, I said no. It’s only day three of my quitting journey but I committed to not another puff, no matter what. I did get some nicotine gum to help with my really bad cravings. But I am finding that the high of being able to overcome those feelings are better than nicotine. I also met my friend inside, after they smoked, and gave them some of my nicotine gum. They were reluctant but I hope us having the journey of overcoming the addiction can help others realize it is possible. Anything is possible.",40

I'm making this post to see if anyone else has experienced the things I have with Allen Carr's Easy Way to stop smoking. Here's the timeline: 

About two and a half years ago, I decided to give Allen Carr's method a try. I figured ""what have I got to lose?"" and gave his book a read. The remarkable thing is that it worked right after I finished the book. I was able to put the cigarettes down for almost a year and a half, without any cravings whatsoever. 

Then the unfortunate happened. I fell right back into it. That happened about a year or so ago. I was hanging out with a lot of people who were smokers, so I figured I would go ahead and buy a vape pen so I would have something to do while hanging with my smoking friends. 

At first the cravings didn't come back right away, but slowly I started to vape more and more. I even bought bigger vape mods and used higher nicotine vape juices. Eventually I fell right back into the trap of smoking. 

Fast forward to now, and I'm absolutely stuck. I've tried to reread the book again, but all that happens is that I quit for a week or so, feel like I have a craving, then go out and buy a pack of smokes again to repeat the cycle. I've done this at least four times now, and I'm wondering if anyone here has had similar problems with reusing Allen Carr's method once they were rehooked on cigarettes. 

I think my problem stems from three things. One, I know now that the book itself is a form of hypnotherapy. This shouldn't really effect the way I think, but for some reason it does. Whenever I would tell people about this method they would always scoff and say that it wouldn't work, or that it was brainwashing. Most of the time they were just joking, but I feel like maybe I agree with them on a subconscious level. That in turn makes me lose faith in the method. 

Secondly, maybe I'm just not committed to the choice to not smoke at this point. At the end in the final exercise Allen has you solemnly vow to never smoke another a cigarette. I vow to myself that I will never do so, but for some reason I never feel fully assured that I won't. It always feels like I'm telling myself a lie to make myself feel better. 

Finally, maybe I'm just rushing through it every time I read it. Instead of taking my time, like I did the first time, I usually read as much as I can in a day to get the process over with because I don't want to smoke anymore! I want to be free! 

So what do you think I should do at this point? Should I go ahead and try to read it again, and maybe take my time this time around, or should I seek another way? For instance nicotine replacement therapy, or just cold turkey it? Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated!",2

Anyways. 

I caught covid-19 back in April. Been sick for the longest time finally felt better around 5 days ago. I stopped vaping during active illness and vaped a little during recovery and the past couple of days I vaped quite often the past 5 days. I experienced extremely cold toes, claudication(lack of blood flow) in toes, and a small painful sore on my big toe. My physician said it's classic buerger's/raynaud symptoms. Never had anything like it despite heavy vaping for over a year until after covid. 

TL:DR: I'm gonna have to stop if I like toes,feet, and legs.

But then after a year I had to move cities and new job was lots of stress and lots of working from home. I had not much office social life and needed something to as a short break to relax, making coffee or tea would take too much time which I didnt have. Over the few years I quit successfully once but after few months of not even thinking about it I had relapse while vacationing abroad. Friends there didnt know I had quit and got it for me when they got their packs. I thought I am on vacation what the hell and will not smoke on homeland. But as you all know that doesnt happen so easily. Fast forward Dec last year, I decided to try vaping as exchange form of nic and getting out of habit of smoking. While making the switch I ensured I used low nicotine juice. It was a different life which I had no idea of, I could satisfy my habit without smelling and tasting gross. I soon realised how bad cigarette smells and how previously I had to be aware of my proximity to others just in case the smell is there. I am pretty sure the smell was there. I used to smoke a pack in two days. Anyway over time I switched to lower and lower and finally 0 nicotine juices. And then one day I realised that I had not even thought about the vape or smoking in two days. That was a big achievement. Finally my mind was free. Today its been over 6 months. The self isolation and all this covid madness has been a little easier knowing I didnt have to crave for smokes and try to go crazy in order to find them during isolation. I still have my vape and many flavoured juices. I dont need them now. But I do keep them as a reminder of how far I have come. I wanted to share my story cos I know many people here might not have quit yet and might be looking for options other than going cold turkey. I tried that, i even tried nic chews but nothing else worked. So just in case you want to know other ways here’s one that worked for me.",2

I have been using ZYN nicotine pouches to ease my triggers when I'm around my friends who vape and smoke at parties. Not being able to vape has definitely affected me as I constantly am tempted to take a rip with my friends. It's tough.

I vaped for two years, JUUL and salt nic devices primarily. And before 2020 started I finally came to terms with myself and quit.

I REALLY want to vape again now that it's almost summer, and if I were to it would be a tropical mango STIG disposable.

I'm going on vacation in two days, and I know that a disposable would only last me the trip. I'm contemplating getting one just to enjoy for the occasion, but I'm worried about falling back into addiction. I honestly feel that in my heart of hearts I would not go and buy another one after I'm out. I already feel guilty about wanting to buy one.

I started smoking late at 18/19 years old.  My dad was a former smoker who was extremely anti-smoking.  I gained 20 lbs as a freshman in college and swapped sugar for cigs.  Smart, eh?  I tried everything and every gimmick known to man to quit.  The advice my Dad gave me all those years ago when I asked him how did he stop was the best and true for me too.  He said: It's just one decision.  If you make that one decision and mean it, every day will get easier and easier and eventually smoking is gone from your mind.  I still love the smell of smoke outside.  I have no desire to smoke.  I pity the trapped addicted smokers.  I did not gain any weight.  I substituted Deep Breathing for smoking.  Easy and can do anywhere.  I also used something like neuro linguistic programming.  Check out Eldon Taylor's Innertalk quit smoking.  The thing is, addictions are lodged in the subconscious.  If you can get into the subconscious mind and change it, that is the ticket.  I wanted to tell all of you that it is possible, it get's easier, you don't have to gain weight, and the deep breathing and not being in withdrawal 24/7 is so great.  Hang in there everyone.

2020-06-01 23:24:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/guzjqw/tips_and_tricks_i_noticed_helped_me_so_far/,Tips and tricks I noticed helped me so far! :),"I don’t want to sound like an expert but I have noticed some things that helped me over the last little while and Ive been commenting on individual posts but I thought it would be helpful to just make a public one for anyone looking for some advice.

I have been smoking weed and cigarettes regularly from morning until night for 10 years! I was so addicted & I couldn’t do anything without smoking both first. I realized that these substances had so much control over me, I was so grossed out. Lol I dont allow anyone to control me so why was I allowing a substance to have that much power over me? I wanted to be able to tell both these substances no! I control you & I’ll tell you what’s going to happen today. I am the boss! Haha.

What helped me so much was saying goodbye to the cigarettes. Lol i know it sounds funny but I actually went to my favourite spot in the city and smoked my last three cigarettes there. I literally said thank you for all the good times and the drunken nights and all the great conversations and goodbye. I cleaned my car afterwards and left the windows open to air out. Then I said hello to the new chapter in my life. My healthy, smell free clean life. Haha. Its weird but Marie Kondo says to do it with your items in your house and I thought it would work for this too. Thats my first suggestion. 

Next, do you associate cigarettes with activities? I did all the time. While i was drinking a coffee, the minute I got into my car and then driving somewhere because I was bored, after smoking a joint, drinking alcohol, even after i cleaned my car or a room in my house and especially when i was bored!! It was a little insane. I quit cold turkey and slowly battled all the triggers one by one. The first was after I ate. I stayed in my room for the first three days. I would eat and then go straight to my room and watch netflix. The first week i replaced coffee with tea. Then once I got past the eating i moved on to my next obstacle. After a week or so, I started drinking coffee and worked on that for a few days. and then alcohol and then I went on short drives and then hanging out with people who smoke and I just battled smoking weed on Saturday and I don’t feel like having a cigarette. I mean I did in the moment but I overcame it so Im assuming the next time I smoke weed Ill battle it out again just like how Ive overcome all the other triggers Ive listed and it will become easier. I also found a fidget and a hobby. Mine was getting back to my art. I also bought a colouring book which helps me focus on that for a few minutes until the craving passes. Triggers are what make us return back to the habit. Write down all your habits and next to it write whatever you will do to pass that moment. I also think about each trigger is a level to beat like in a video game i guess. Manipulate your mind.

Also, the Smoke free app helps because there is a support system on there for the first little while and some experts which have great tips as well. Another app I downloaded is called EasyQuit. This app gives you an option to plan to slowly quit incase you haven’t already. Both show you how much money you are saving!! Its so nice to see those dollars go up. Haha at first I was looking at it every two minutes to see how much money I saved 😂 and it wasn’t going up that quickly so don’t be too discouraged. But once you even get to the second week you will be surprised. I saved $200 and I bought myself some new art stuff! Treat yourself, reward yourself for your accomplishments! A-lot of info but I hope it helps! Good-luck everyone! We can do this!!! And remember! Not another puff, no matter what! 👍",5

I went back to my small hometown where a lot more people smoke and everyone in my family does. I said fuck it and bought a pack. First one was so gross but I still smoked it. And then they got easier as I went through the pack. But then I woke up the next day and my chest was tight and I smelt gross. But I kept smoking throughout my visit. And each day it got worse and worse.   

I got home two days ago and had to admit to my husband I was smoking again. Being the wonderful and kind man he is he didn’t get mad or disappointed. He said every time I’ve quit I’ve quit for longer and he was proud of me for my two and a half month streak. 

But this morning I broke the 12 cigarettes I had left in half again. I’m not going to fall back into the trap. I don’t like the way it feels. I don’t like smelling bad, waking up with a cough, having to step outside and smoke while everyone else stays inside.

I'm 32 and been smoking since I was 15. I gave up for a year and replaced it by vaping. But then when I started going out more with friends, having drinks, I started smoking again. I've tried to vape again since, but it never felt as satisfying the first time round, I think I enjoyed the novelty of vaping more than anything else.

I realistically just can't afford to smoke anymore, I'm either spending £10 a day on cigarettes, or £11 every 3 days on a pouch of tobacco.

My problem is I have little to no willpower.

I've been looking at going to my GP and asking for Champix (I'm not sure what it would be called overseas).

I am a hidden smoker that is I don’t smoke openly and only do it in my bathroom or in the car. Although everyone in my family knows about it but it is not an open fact. Therefore I cannot turn to anyone local for help.

I have tried quitting in the past but never succeeded. This time I tried the smoke free app and managed 2 days without one but then my cravings gave in. I bought a pack and have been smoking 4-5 in a day (used to smoke about 15-18 till one week back). I have not reset the app and I enter the smokes in the craving and coach which I guess is of no use.

I have become so dependent on it especially to go to the bathroom anytime. It’s almost like I don’t want to go without having a cigarette.

I am mostly alone and the loneliness makes me want to smoke more. I cannot seem to find the motivation to quit even though I know and understand the health risks and complications that might happen to me.

I want to quit because I don’t want this bad habit and the amount of time I spend on it.

I hope being a part of this group and sharing will help me be strong and I will finally be able to quit.",5
