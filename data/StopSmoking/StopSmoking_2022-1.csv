I have smoked roughly 1-2 packs daily depending on the life circumstances. This past year I have tried to actively quit. I have tried every strategy that is recommended but I always fail. I always cave. I have tried to use fear of health, brute will power, lowering doses and so much more, but I always break before the 3 day mark. 

I get way to irritated, way to groggy and extremely tired. My mind is cloudy and with one thought, the sweet rush of the first cigarette after a while. Once I break, I come back to smoking and I beat myself over the head for it. The negativity makes me afraid to do it and so I wait for a couple of weeks before I have enough courage to do try and quit again.

Recently I tried taking it as a game of sorts, to see how long I could last. Started off decent and then automatic complacency returned me to square one.
I tried various nicotine substitutes, never helped me, never felt them. E cigs are a temporary thing and a gateway. Hookah was the best strategy, lasted a week before I caved under pressure.  

In some way I have entered the right headspace, at least that's what I think. Take it as a challenge/puzzle I have to solve but I feel my strategies are not fruitful. How and what can I do to be functional in some capacity and how do I combat this craving that overrides my thinking to just seek out a pack and a lighter?",1

I am planning to quit anything that enters my body through inhaling. I am taking it step by step, but there is something stopping me. Today I smelled cigarettes in my office and it made me want to smoke a cigarette so bad unconsciously, and I didn‚Äôt. This urge that makes you want to smoke is not going away, and to be honest, I am afraid of myself without nicotine.

Just had minor withdrawal pangs for a couple of days, mostly due to nicotine but never had any other serious pangs! (like stress, anger, irritation, sleep disorders)

Hi all, This is my first post on reddit, please ignore grammar (English is non-native).  Apologies for the long text. I believe adding details helps readers to connect my story with theirs. 

**Who am I?** 33(M), introvert, married, father to a 3yr old. SW Engineer.

**When & Why did I start:** I had a huge crush on a girl during my college days. Never had the courage to ask her out for the 1st 2 years. I finally decided to ask her out the very first after the semester break. I had no idea what to talk or how to approach because I was getting nervous and couldn't fall asleep. That's when I decided to try smoking to calm myself. If I could time travel, I will probably punch that stupid boy right across the face and knock him out! (If you are wondering, I did ask her out but she didn't agree :P )

**Lows I have seen:**

* My father once saw me smoking and in an instance, there were tears in his eyes (Till then the only time I had only seen my father cry was when his father passed away). He controlled himself, requested me to quit, and didn't rat on me with my mother. I suppose he knew how horrible the addiction was and wished I never get into it, just like how I wish my son never smokes. I only managed to quit for a few days, then got back. (This was when I had just started smoking, like around 20, so I never knew what this drug would eventually do to me).
* I smoked on the day my father passed away. I was only 28, not a day goes by w/o thinking about him. He passed away due to a severe stroke of the brain. (not a smoking-related death I guess)
* I smoked on the day my son was born (in my defense, the doc said it will probably take an hour for enough dilation. I was hanging on w/o smoking till then)
* I smoked on the day I got married.
* I smoked on the day I underwent a not-so-minor surgery (If you are wondering, yes I smoked at the hospital. I paid extra and got a private room just so that I can smoke! Go beat that)
* I have avoided going anywhere with my in-laws since I won't be able to smoke around them. My wife feels I don't get along well with her parents so I avoid going on trips. But she doesn't know the reality.
* Sometimes, I have stayed awake till 4-4.30 Am just to buy cigarettes when I had run out of ciggs somewhere in the night.
* I stockpiled about 20-30 packs when the lockdown was unexpectedly announced. When folks were stockpiling ration. I was going from shop to shop buying as much as they have. Even paying 20-30% above the sticker price.
* As a student when I had to rely on a meager monthly scholarship (8K INR pm) that govt gave us, I rather eat at a cheap place but never cut down or even quit smoking.
* Smoking in Indian trains is a serious offense, in spite of knowing it. I have smoked in the lavatory usually in the night when most people would have slept. Fellow smokers would also be waiting outside just to smoke. Even after getting caught and paying a fine, I didn't stop. (My train journey was about 36 hours long, so you can imagine how painful it would have been to not smoke at all).

**How did I quit:**

Since Covid started, I started to imagine the situation if I were to get Covid and that scared me. However, I knew quitting was going to be super hard. Somewhere in the subreddit I got to know about Alan Carr's book and I got one for myself. I started reading and stopped midway (around \~30 %) because I was scared that finishing the book might mean I have to quit. (That is what this drug does to an otherwise sane person!) After a few months, gathered courage and started to read again, failed again (only this time I had finished \~50%).

Got to know about quitsure app and the reviews looked promising. This time I read the book and used the app. On day 10, I was done with about 90% of the book and completed the last exercise of the app. I believe programming your subconscious mind is the trickiest part of quitting. Reading the book and using the app helped me immensely.

Day 1 & 2 were a bit rough (but there was no physical pain), just a feeling of missing something. This was primarily the body wanting nicotine. (The conscious part of the brain asking for a dose of nicotine). After those 2-3 days, I started to feel very good (physically) after each passing day.

There are odd cravings every now and then, but they just die out almost instantaneously. All I have to do is remember what I learned from the book and the app. Walking, deep breaths, drinking water helped a lot.

**Why did I quit:**

* **Get rid of Slavery:** I come from a lower middle-class family, and I struggled hard to reach where I am. I am in control of every aspect of my life, but nicotine was controlling me. This slavery to a drug had to be stopped so that I can unleash my mind.
* **Profession:** The kind of work I do requires intense focus. I genuinely believe smoking not only makes you dumb (by making it harder to pump more blood into the brain) but it also breaks the flow (ex: not being able to sit and code/debug for 3-4 hours straight). I think I have extremely underutilized my potential primarily due to smoking and its side effects.
* **For my son:** If my son ever smokes because of me I will never be able to forgive myself.
* **Family:** I am the man of my house and I intend to behave like one.
* **Health:** I guess this is a no-brainer.
* **Money:** Since I earn a lot, this was never a reason :D

&#x200B;

**Positives seen so far (most of it were seen after 2-3 days):**

* My resting heart-beat has come down from 75-80 to 65-70.
* Had never realized how shallow my breaths were until I quit
* I am definitely way more energetic, calmer than before.
* My wife and friends are super happy and proud. One of my friends (another ex-smoker) kept tab on me each day and kept sharing how he stayed away during the withdrawal period.
* My finger doesn't stink.
* Never felt any discomfort in my chest while I went to bed. There were days (before I quit) when I used to get a burning, squeezing sensation in my lungs especially when I smoked too much.
* Extremely mild hangover even after heavy drinking. (Note: if you believe alcohol will make you smoke even if you quit, then avoid it as long as possible. More on this is covered in the app where there is an entire section just on this)
* Feel way more confident when I  go around the house. Earlier, I used to be cautious not to get too close to my mother or my son as soon as I have smoked.

**My advice to smokers:**

* Read Alan Carr's book! If you are not a book person check-out quitsure app.(The best 10$ I ever spent. If you can't afford, DM me. I will sponsor at least 1 person every month).
* Don't lose hope! Don't assume you can never quit and drift along with the addiction.
* Be active on this subreddit, I believe it subtly reprograms your subconscious mind.
* Most importantly make a decision that you want to quit (within a reasonable timeframe). I agree it is hard to quit cold-turkey just using willpower, that's where the app or book comes into play.

**Regards!**

PS:  I will use whatever resources I practically can to fight this drug. Hopefully, someday this subreddit would be in archives:)",11

It needs to stop.

I have noticed that when I have something available to puff on (like a vape) I don't chew on things. Even when I just puff on it every 15 mins or so I don't chew on anything.

Are there any ""safe"" nicotine-free, THC-free vape options just for that oral fixation? Maybe other things that have helped for you guys?",3

2022-01-29 13:35:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/sfofzo/how_i_quit_smoking/,How I quit smoking,"Hello there r/stopsmoking,

I stumbled upon this subreddit, and would like to share my own experience on the off-chance it might be of some help to somebody out there.

Until February of last year, I'd been been smoking upwards of a pack a day. It had been about 7 years since I started, and it had reached a point where I'd started to be woken in the night by fairly severe chest pains.

At the time, I didn't have particularly healthy habits in general. Going to bed/waking up late, and a poor diet. 

Having attempted to quit with limited success on three previous occasions, I decided that this was going to be the final time. At the start, instead of going full-on cold turkey, I limited myself to one cigarette every hour.

It wasn't a huge difference to begin with, but I certainly caught myself a few times where ordinarily I would have smoked. I felt an intense rush each time I did smoke.

After a while, once the hourly craving had subsided, I stretched myself to a cigarette every two hours. Each time the rush diminished, I added another hour.

Eventually, I found myself smoking a single cigarette per day. The most difficult step by far was cutting out the final cigarette, but after a day or two the major cravings were gone. 

I'd like to reassure everyone out there trying to quit that it can also be a gradual process. If you've tried to quit before without success, have a go at listening to your own body and go from there.

Apologies for the lengthy text, but if I can help even a single person to cut out this horrendous habit then it was worth it.",12

Besides being vaccinated I am sure the other big factor is that I do not smoke anymore. I couldn't imagine having the bug and wanting to smoke, the thought alone is disgusting.

A good friend of mine had it a few months before me and he is still a smoker. He even smoked during covid because the cravings wouldn't let him in peace. He is still short of breath even months later.

So to all of you out there no matter If you are still at the beginning of your journey or already advanced... stay strong and stay healthy. We will not smoke today together!",17

I haven't calculated the total cost, but I know I've spent probably over $2000 on these things over the last couple of years. 

 I've tried to quit a number of times, but I keep on going back. I read Allan Carr's book and was able to quit for over a month, but found myself smoking them again. Today I'm throwing out anything that reminds me of it, and am going to grit my teeth and get through this thing. I don't want this waste of health and money in my life anymore. I'm nervous to stop as I have integrated vaping into literally everything I do. Driving, eating, gaming, after a workout, after work, lounging. Everything. I'm constantly vaping the strongest nicotine possible all day. It needs to stop. 

I'm worried about how I'll be with people and a how I'll be at work while coming off, but I need to get through this pain.

And you can look forward to a time that it‚Äôs not a battle. No cravings. Vigilance yes, never get overconfident especially when drinking but cravings will go. 

Yes first days and weeks were hard but then it DOES get better. If you want it then just hang in there knowing your day of easing up will come. You can do it!",63

As some of you might see from my post history I was doing alright, I hated the smell of cigarettes, could resist temptations from people offering cigarettes and smoking in front of me. The thing is, now I don't know how to deal with stress, I have noticed a significant increase in alcohol consumption after going sober (before quitting I drank, at most, once every six months, compared to getting shitface drunk twice in one month). But yesterday I finally broke, I don't know why... It tasted terrible, it smelled terrible, it made me feel sick but I don't know how else to cope other than cigarettes. This relapse made me realize how important the mental battle is, but at the same time, I don't know how to actually overcome this difficulty.

The vape became like a pacifier for me, it was constant smoking. once I ran out of juice I turned back to cigs and noticed my addiction got way worse (I went from 10 to 20 a day).

I‚Äôm back on the patch for now, I can‚Äôt handle cold turkey. I‚Äôm chewing gum too, just regular gum. I also decided to disable my social media accounts for a week or two, just to get myself set straight. I spend too much time on my phone.

I started over thinking the thought of catching Covid (I'm not actually too worried about actually catching it, seeing as the people I know who have had it haven't suffered that badly) so I don't know why over-thinking it triggers me so much, anyway I have a panic attack and faint, wake up 10 seconds later barely able to function (pulled myself to the couch and was able to call an ambulance, (same thing happened a month ago but didn't go to hospital because I thought it was due to dehydration), spend the night in hospital doing heaps of tests, everything was fine and I'm considered a healthy young adult, the only thing they noted was that my lungs were 'hyper-inflated' and when I first went in my heartbeat was a bit whack. The hyper-inflated lungs bit scared me, I figured it was because of smoking, I've been smoking since 2019 (21 years of age) but haven't actually been smoking that much, maybe 3-4 a day. But I think it's defiantly a sign that I need to quit. Has anyone else had hyperinflated lungs? Is it something that can be healed? Thanks everyone",4

Started with the occasional vaping after meals and in the evening to relax. When covid came and we were all locked up it got worse. I started vaping from the morning when I woke up until I went to bed in the evening. I was addicted and after 1-2 hours of not vaping my taste buds would start to scream for a puff, it's so crazy.

I've not touched my vape in 16 days and I've quit cold turkey (after trying to quit slowly for about a month). After a couple of days I started to feel a little bit nauseous but it was only for like 2-3 days and it got better. Now, a big week after, I start to feel nauseous again. I was scared for night sweats, bad sleep, headaches... but I don't get any of those withdrawal symptoms. The only thing I get is nausea and the feeling I don't want to do anything. I'll think of something that I should do and one sec later I'll be like nah, I don't want to do it. 

I used to use my vape as a motivator. When I'd work from home and have to do a lot of stuff, I'll take a few puffs and work. After 10mins, a couple of puffs and work. It was a chain. I can only imagine the chemical situation in my brain and the detoxing going on in the last 2 weeks.

What have been ways to motivate you when quitting smoking/vaping? It feels like losing a friend, that's always with you and makes you feel better. How do you replace that, or do you just get used to not having that friend anymore?

I started smoking when I was thirteen because I thought it made me look ""cool."" Looking back I can only imagine how cringy it was to see some dingus kid with a cig hanging out of their mouth. 

I hated the taste at first, it was not an instant attraction. I distinctly remember how bad the taste was, but I didn't care and powered on. My friend's mother (my enabler) bought us cigarettes, and booze. She was the ""fun"", hip parent in comparison to my warden of a mother.

My addiction only grew with age, and when my father and stepmother moved in I was gifted an endless supply of smokes at my disposal. My stepmom being the smoker, became my new supplier. We had rituals and smoke breaks, I was an impressionable teenager (15) and she filled the void of my mother being gone. Those moments of bonding reenforced my addiction, it became so much more than just lighting up.

My eighteenth birthday was spent buying a carton of cigarettes and feeling ""empowered"" by my new ability. I loved the ease of purchasing cigarettes, no more vicarious transactions needed. At this point I was living with my ex boyfriend at his mother's house, his mother being the epitome of a chimney. The house had an overwhelming stench of stale cigarettes, and the walls were inadvertently painted yellow. But I didn't care, I didn't have to freeze my ass off so I partook, (if you can't beat em, join em.)

Once I moved out on my own I could barely afford rent, food and cigarettes, so oftentimes I would sacrifice eating so that I could have my precious cigs. I got down to a whopping eighty something pounds, but I didn't care, I had my fix.

My addiction ruled my life, I woke up poured some coffee, went outside for a smoke. I would poop, then go back outside. It was my dessert, my appetizer, my main course...it was...my everything.
Then one day I randomly lit my cigarette with a match and it burnt my lungs. I no longer wanted a cigarette, this was unusual for me, I mean I smoked cigarettes while I was puking my brains out with the flu, but now...it was painful.

The first twenty four hours I watched that fucking clock tick, I never took my eyes off of it. I couldn't believe I went a day without a smoke! I took sleeping pills and crashed. Next morning all I wanted to do was go outside and smoke, but I didn't. I kept thinking about the damn carton of cigarettes that I had just bought just sitting in my freezer, I pictured them calling out my name, begging me to break...but I didn't. Took some sleeping pills and went back to bed. Day freaking three, perhaps the hardest freaking day of them all, I woke up in a cold sweat. My body ached for me to give in, I was feeling the pressure, but I held on.

I decided I was going to learn to knit...so I bought all the shit to make an afghan and went to town. I kid you not in the first month I finished two and a half blankets! Both being 5x5'8! I lost myself with every stitch, and with every inch completed I started to feel... satisfied.

After the first month I stopped thinking about cigarettes. By the six month mark I started to get more energy, I felt better than I did in YEARS! I went for hikes, walks, bike rides, I literally immersed myself into working out, because I gained like fifteen pounds because food tastes amazing!!!! I didn't even realize how much I never actually tasted anything.

I'm now over my one year mark and I'm so damn proud of myself. If I had told younger me that one day I would quit and never look back I would have pissed my pants laughing at such a notion. 

To all of you who are putting in the effort, I am so PROUD of you!!!! You are all rockstars and you've got this! You are strong, much stronger than you think, and I believe in you!!! Keep kicking ass and taking names!

Good luck!",10

Cigarettes were part of my life for 28 years now.
An average of 1 Pack a day.
I made about 4-5 attempts to quit in that time.
Most tries lasted for 3-4 weeks, one for almost a year. I never felt remarkably bad from smoking. No bad coughing, rarely ill. Well 15 years ago I had a real heavy tonsillitis and had my tonsils removed. I may have been induced by smoking. 

The last few months I noticed I became a little short in breathing and when exhaling deeply before sleeping I heard some weeping noise from my bronchi and I needed to get up and cough a little to get rid of it.
These Symptoms made me decide to quit permanently.

What I wanted to point out is, that I lived relatively well with the tobacco.

Also the process of quitting was surprisingly never a big deal for me. Absolutely no physical withdrawal symptoms, no fluctuations of mood. Only I missed it somehow and contemplating, if it wouldn‚Äôt be harmful, would I go on with this maybe?

But what really makes me wonder is that besides a slightly better feeling of breathing and no weeping noises, no coughing out mucus anymore, I don‚Äôt feel any different really. 

When I do exercise It doesn‚Äôt feel like my performance improved (shouldn‚Äôt there already a few days after quitting be more oxygen available with the carbon monoxide gone?)

 I feel rather more tired than energetic. And overall as if I got 10 years older since I quit. Leg Muscles are stiff after sports and also my heart rate didn‚Äôt really decrease compared to the time of consuming nicotine. A year ago I stopped smoking in those weeks it decreased significantly by 10-15 bpm resting HR and below 50 while sleeping.

Is it possible to have just an aging flare within a few months so that this just merged into by coincidence?",1

I heard that the symptoms could be depression, anxiety and also gaining weight, but I didn't really think much of it then. 
Well I thought that my will to live would come once I get through the first couple of weeks but little did I know that I would still feel like this.

I can't get joy out of anything, and it sucks so bad. I'd really want to start smoking again. I've also gained weight because drinking soda is the only thing that helps me feel even a little bit better. I know I'm being hard on myself.

Been a smoker 10 years and about 4 years smoking 2 packs. Last year a coworker bought ""Champix"" from some other country (our insurance does not cover it) for us. I started on the half doses while continuing to smoke as instructed in the packages. Then I started the second week.

    The shit is sorcery. I was in awe of how I was able to even make it a day. I chewed on tooth picks and straws to get me by but I wasn't irritated at all. I cant usually hold off for more than a couple of hours before I'm losing my shit. It fucking works. I had ZERO issues with it. No nightmares etc. what I did notice was that I had never felt better in my entire life.

    Im a very anxious person. Not a nervous worrier but definitely very aggravated, impatient, irritable, pessimistic, short fused. In short I'm an asshole. I hate it. Im a dad and new homeowner and work 6 days a week like a fucking dog. Its hard work and I get by running on coffee and smoke. Im a roughneck and a hard ass but do ok with my family. The wife and kids make jokes about it. It sucks.

    After the second week my wife and coworkers were amazed at how good of a mood I was in. It was VERY significant. But like many after a month I said I can do this and stopped taking it. And here we are a year later smoking again and raging again.

    Ive just gone to a professional to try and address my issues and inquire as to how/why the Chantix cured my shitty mood. I walked out with scripts for antidepressants and no clue as to how the Chantix helped. Unexpected honestly and feeling slightly defeated.

    Hopefully somebody here can answer my questions.

1. Is my 2 1/2 pack addiction making me this asshole? (I cant even remember myself when I didnt smoke)

2. Is Chantix working on me as a antidepressant aside from smoking cessation curing me of my shitty mood? Has this been reported? Is it known? Links?

    Regardless I'm doing 1 thing at a time to start trying to resolve the issues and trying to live a healthier lifestyle.",1

I was first eased into both via spliffs made of cigarettes and hash. Sooo delicious. Where I was living at the time, marijuana products are highly illegal and as such, flower was extremely hard to come by and of poor quality when it could be accessed. 

Prior to my departure from this country, I was going through 3-4 spliffs and a pack of cigs per week. Following my return to Canada in summer 2019, I began smoking spliffs made of flower and the cheapest cigs I could find (oh Pall Mall, how I love/hate you).
In the fall, I tried switching to nic vapes and dab pens which only led to me smoking 24/7, indoors and out. Eventually, I was smoking 2-3 spliffs and cigs per day along with hitting my vape and dab when I was too depressed to go outside. This of course all happened around the same time the worldwide lockdown went into full effect.

By late 2021, I managed to kick my vape and dab, I only smoked cigs when they were made into spliffs, and I acquired my own bong which I thought would help make my stash of flower last longer. Boy, was I wrong!

All of a sudden I‚Äôm smoking 5-8 poppers a day, every day. They‚Äôre rimmers, and usually 50-70% tobacco. I barely even smoke spliffs any more. I have only decided to take a break now because 2 days ago, my ‚Äúusual‚Äù morning nausea turned into a full-fledged puke fest and I am convinced I‚Äôve entered the hyperemetic phase of CHS. Terrifying and depressing.

The thing is, even as I type this and am still craving my dear bong, I know for a fact that I don‚Äôt crave the high. I crave the deep, strong hit to the chest that only tobacco can give you, and the ensuing head rush that is simply inimitable. Inexplicably, pure green bowls and joints make me cough, but spliffs and poppers hit perfectly and painlessly. They‚Äôre just‚Ä¶ more fun.

But, I know it has to stop. My tolerance is appalling and I just don‚Äôt appreciate or even like weed on its own the same way anymore. What a shitty duel-pronged dependency, am I right?",9

I started with analogs my freshman year of college before switching over to vaping after a year. Throughout college, there were times when I‚Äôd go back to analogs but since graduating in 2015 I have not had a single cigarette and have only been vaping. I don‚Äôt even remember what year nic salts became a thing but I‚Äôve been on those since. I‚Äôd vape from the second I woke up to the last few hits before bed. I was going through at least 2ml of 25mg juice a day. 

My fianc√© has always wanted me to stop, and I kept pushing it off saying ‚Äúone day‚Äù or ‚Äúwhen we have a kid‚Äù. The thought of quitting gave me crippling anxiety and made me vape even more. 

Two weeks ago, I decided I just need to do it. I made the effort to face my fears and just get it over with. I started browsing this sub, doing research, reading Allen Carr, making a plan, and set my quit date Monday (1/24). 

I decided to go with patches. Today is my second day and I honestly feel pretty good. I do get tons of psychological cravings but they are manageable. I feel like once I get over those while gradually dropping down in patch strengths, it‚Äôll be a lot easier for me to be free from nicotine entirely. Which leads me to the point of this post. 

I understand that I‚Äôm still enslaved to nicotine, but I never imagined that I‚Äôd be able to go a day without vaping. I‚Äôm feeling really confident that I‚Äôll be able to nip this habit in the bud as long as I follow the proper steps. 

So if any of you can share your success stories with the patches I‚Äôd love to hear it because far too many posts I read just bash on NRT‚Äôs. I have so much respect for CT quitters (both my parents did it), but I really don‚Äôt get why hate on NRT‚Äôs. From what I‚Äôve heard, there‚Äôs no right way to quit as long as you do. 

TL;DR I feel confident that I‚Äôll be able to quit using NRT‚Äôs by breaking my psychological addiction first and then weaning off nicotine. Would love to hear others stories of success.",13

My hope is that I can quit smoking and improve on my health with diet and exercise regularly even though that has proven harder to do than quiting. Thoughts?

Yesterday I was going to try and eliminate the mints NRT because I was having such bad cravings but I didn‚Äôt stop them. I had less than the day before and also really noticed how they really do make me crave a cigarette more, the crappy feeling of nicotine without the smoke is just not as fun. So even though I‚Äôm on day seven, I‚Äôm attempting day one with no NRT and hoping that I have a much smoother day with cravings!

Been smoking nearly a pack a day for about 23 years-minus a year where I quit completely... I know, I know- stupid me for falling back into it! Anyways, I am fully committed to never having another puff this time! 

I was hoping that this community could give me some additional motivation; something that can help me now and also give me something(s) to look forward to as I progress through my quitting journey. 

Aside from the obvious reasons, what are some benefits of having been a non-smoker for a while that often get overlooked? What changes have you noticed throughout your quit that you maybe didn't anticipate? What are some of the lesser-known aspects of being a former smoker that are you enjoying now?

Thanks in advance! Love this community- keep on keeping on!",15

I just turned 50 this year, and I have been smoking on and off for about 7 years. I say that but my quits where only about 3 mo. each time so really smoking for about 6 years. To complicate it, I was a total closet smoker. hiding it from everyone. Sneaking it in when I could. Binge smoking when I had freedom. So when I stop smoking it's all on me. No support structure. Just having to deal with it all on my own. The first time I quite it was really rough. The anxiety and stomach issues where brutal but I got through it. The second time was not as bad because I knew what  to expect. took about 6 weeks to get through it and managed. This time has been the worst. Partly because I quit drinking too 20 days ago. Those withdrawals piled on top of the smoking ones. I think age is now a factor. I had my yearly physical at about 30 days and my cholesterol was the highest ever. If I wanted to continue living I had to make a serious change. I'm almost at 2 months and thought I got through it last week. I was feeling good and felt I turned a corner. I was even planning on exercising and bought a spin bike.  And then, my lungs decided to speak up and say ""NOPE"" They are healing and I feel it. I had asthma before I started smoking so I may have done some real damage this time around.  I've had all sorts of aches pains and itching. you name it, I've experienced it. lol Time will tell what the outcome will be. Regardless, I am determined to be done with smoking. This withdrawal cycle is just not worth it. I literally loose a month of life as I am deal with getting clean. The quality of life just sucks for at least 2 months. Nicotine and all those chemicals we suck in are the devil. 

Anyway, The whole point to this is to see if others have found similar results. It always help to hear about others journeys to show we are not alone. 

Thanks in advance for the share!",5

I smoked for 13 years , I wish i hadnt but i was too addicted tried quitting 20+ times but finally stopped after using nicotine gum and pouches. Im still using using gum 70 days in, plan on quitting that soon as well. Previously i have quit for 5 months cold turkey but went back to smoking. Now i plan on never going back but sometimes the cravings are intense, I'm just gonna take nicotine gum or pouches whenever I get the cigarette craving.

Last week I received a letter from my primary care doctor saying he is terminating me as a patient effective immediately and gave me the phone number to my medical insurance for me to call to find a new primary care doctor. I call the insurance and they gave me three doctors that are accepting new patients. I call each doctor and none of them are taking new patients. Great. I re-read the letter my old primary care doctor sent me and it says at the bottom ‚Äúif you need immediate medical help, visit the local emergency room or near by walk in health center.‚Äù I knew if I went to the main hospital ER it would take 3-4 hours so I decided to visit the local health center, which I have been to in the past for poison Ivy treatment. I go to the healthcare center, walk into the waiting room and right away a nurse comes up to me and asks why I am here. I told her that I am in between primary care doctors and I only have two 14 mg patches left, I have one on now and a new one for tomorrow then after tomorrow I am all out. She then says ‚Äúlet‚Äôs talk in the hall way‚Äù (wicked strange). I show her the letter my primary care doctor sent me and my insurance card and she says ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have to ask the provider if we can do this‚Äù. She then goes to the provider and I‚Äôm waiting in the hall way. She then comes back out and says ‚Äúthe provider has declined to write a script for you‚Äù I then asked why? She says ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt write scripts here‚Äù (which is complete BS because I had a script for Betamethazone that they wrote me for my poison Ivy). I explain that I have received scripts here before. She then says let me go speak to another nurse. She goes and gets this wicked snobby nurse. She comes out and starts saying we‚Äôre not writing you a script and raising her voice at me. I let her speak and finish then respond politely ‚ÄúI have this letter‚Ä¶‚Äù she cuts me off and goes back to saying WE ARE NOT WRITING YOU A SCRIPT. Yelling at me and causing a scene. I ask to speak to the manager and she said there is no manager. She then says ‚ÄúIM CALLING THE POLICE‚Äù. At this point, I‚Äôm kind of laughing inside and I say there is absolutely no reason to call the cops, I‚Äôm trying to get 7mg patches so I can quit smoking for good. I‚Äôm at 40ish days with help of the patches and this is the longest I been without them and I want to finish the original treatment that my original primary care has me on before he terminated me. She then turned the other way and walks back to the main office. I said under my breath ‚Äúwhat a bitch‚Äù because we can all be a bitch at times, my self included. And she really was. Then a third nurse comes out; she had an office down the hall and could hear the previous conversation. She says I understand where your coming from. Let me get you a piece of paper that can help you. I said thank you and she left to get the paper. Then a fourth person starts yelling at me from the waiting room into the hall way where I am. She says ‚Äúyou better leave NOW!‚Äù I said excuse me but who are you? She says ‚ÄúIM A NURSE‚Äù I said you don‚Äôt look like a nurse (she had a puffy blue coat and no badge) she then says again WERE CALLING THE POLICE! I said there is no reason to and I‚Äôm waiting for the other nurse to come back with the paper she said she was going to bring me and you‚Äôre trying to get a rise out of me but it won‚Äôt work so please stop talking to me. As soon as I said this I could feel the deflation of her personality and she did finally stop yealing at me. About 2 mins pass and the other nurse came back with information on the near by ER. I said thank you, she said have a nice day and I said you as well and walked down the hall towards the door. I make it to my car, turn it on and leave the parking lot. I am now on the road and see two Police SUVs with lights come flying into the parking lot. I said I can‚Äôt believe they actually called the cops and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a matter of time before they get in touch with me. Then I see a police SUV with lights on speeding towards me to I pull over. I explaine everything I just said to the officer, he looked at the paperwork and understood where I was coming from. I asked am I under arrest? He says ‚Äúno and I can‚Äôt believe they called us for this shit‚Äù (lol cool cop). He then says try the other emergency walk in or try the ER and if all fails just go buy 7mg patches. I said why would I pay for patches when my insurance has been covering the 21 and the 14. He said only as a last resort. He then let me go and I drive to the other emergency walk in clinic. This whole situation took about an hour and a half. I get to the other walk in clinic, and no joke about 10 mins from walking in to walking out they filled the script and I drove back home and picked them up at the drug store about an hour ago. The moral of the story if there even is one is I am never smoking again or going through this bull shit ever again. I was shocked, and dazed after all of this and I don‚Äôt really talk to anyone face to face and needed to get this out. Only question I have for myself is ‚Äúis this worth doing again?‚Äù And my answer is a Stone Cold STEVE Austin HELL NO!",7

So I tried not posting about it or talking about it to anyone, and I did okay with the ""game"" again. But still kept smoking.

Finally, a week ago, I threw out my pack of smokes and my lighter at a far away garbage can and didn't smoke at all.. Until mom came home from work and gave me one when I asked. 

Now, I'm going all day without smoking every day, but only smoking when I am given smokes, or if it's the weekend, buying my own pack. And yeah, this morning I threw out another half pack and lighter but I'm now closing in on 6 hours without a smoke, but my kid is due home soon. 

How do I get out of this loop of restarting every evening.. I just want it to be over. I mean, I do know how to get out of the loop, just stop asking, but it's hard when I need to make dinner for everyone every night.

It sounded a bit too familiar when it visualised fear as a monster that can be overcome.

That got me thinking about Alan Carr. I actually imagine the little and big monsters working as a team, the little one dead and the big one permanently locked in a cage, unable to summon the little monster because it's dead.

If I ever get a smoking thought, I imagine a bit of fluff on my shoulder and physically brush it off. It works 99% of the time. If it doesn't I move onto the monster scene.

Clearly what Carr has discovered is the amazing power of our imagination to influence our mind. I also feel that his talks on brain washing have unlocked something. A new way of perceiving advertising and snake oil type sales.

So my question is, could the Alan Carr method be adapted to overcome fear and procrastination?

If smoking cravings (just a powerful as fear) are just a thought that can easily be overcome, then why not fear or any other emotional state?

I've tried to quit so many times since then I lost count. Along time ago, I didn't want to identify as an addict, or even have that line of thought. I honestly believed I loved the way smoking made me feel, even though it wasn't an optional activity, even though I would quickly grow anxious, unfocused, miserable, restless, and everything else imaginable, without it. Even though I couldn't take a ""break"" from smoking tobacco without putting myself through hell. Shit, if I ever tried to stop smoking with just the mindset to ""take a break"" and let my lungs ""heal a bit"", I would just be back smoking the next day or hours later. It seemed like all I ever was looking forward to was the next smoke, every day, all day, year after year, nothing seeming better, and even then, for years, I didn't want to call myself a drug addict.

And now where I'm at, I'm fully aware if I take just one hit for any reason, it's all over. And I relapsed enough times to know it's never just one hit anyways. There's never been a single time out of the 50 times I've relapsed where I was like okay, that's enough, I had one hit. I just go into machine mode and it's all over.

For the first month or so I kept having some sort of feeling in my head that I feel could only be relieved by having a smoke, it's like some sort of mental craving where my head feels a bit fuzzy and unfocused and I think I need more tobacco. Hard to describe, but now that I think about it, it hasn't happened in a while.

I think at this point it's been an on-and-off depression thing for me. Some days I get real down, and think well, life is so miserable, I don't know if I want to go on, why not just smoke to at least enjoy something? And then I remember, yeah, it didn't work like that at all. Smoking didn't solve my problems. Smoking was always an escape for me, and it was becoming a very regretful and unreliable one at that. It wasn't always a ""pleasure"".. that was becoming the out-liar experience if anything. Most of time they tasted nasty, I didn't want to smoke them but needed them, and I'd be left with a burning chest and struggling to breath, which was only magnified since I usually just felt like that normally as an active smoker. And that was my day-to-day existence. Yeah, calling that a ""pleasure"" was far from the truth. I keep in mind now that I have to be a full-fledged drug addict if I want to derive pleasure from tobacco, and that means living like a ticking time-bomb, every day, waiting to see what physical disaster awaits me next.

Being an active smoker means dealing with consequences and things getting worse with every passing month & year. It was all very easy to ignore my first 6 years of smoking I'd say (I've smoked for 11-12 years). The only thing that bothered me then was the insane urges to smoke and the withdrawals when I didn't have it. Then I started having problems breathing, doing basic things like walking, talking, dealing with serious tooth decay.

I'm done rambling now. Good luck to all you trying to quit. And to anyone who hasn't read this, Joel has always been my go-to guy when I need a reminder of the harsh reality that is this addiction. [https://whyquit.com/joel/ntap.pdf](https://whyquit.com/joel/ntap.pdf)",44

Mostly ciggies, although this past year I've gotten into disposable vapes. I never really had a problem moderating my ciggie intake (3-6 a day) and I even had days where I wouldn't smoke at all and not be bothered. 

Man, vapes are a game changer. I cannot put these things down. The menthol hit is honestly one of the most addicting factors. I have been overloading my brain with nicotine for the past year all day every day. Today is day 4 of a cold turkey quit on nicotine... and I am DYING. I have been trying so hard to get my health in good shape recently and man this shit is fucking 5x harder than getting sober from alcohol and marijuana. My mind is in a constant state of fucking agony and even though I haven't had a cigarette in weeks because I've been vaping the thought of lighting up feels like the only thing that could make the pain go away. But I know that's not true. Exercise has been helping a lot. Getting some sunlight and eating good food puts the cravings back for a little bit. I'll admit I've been drinking again at night just so I can even have a change at falling asleep but if that's what I have to do so be it. Even with some drinks in me I can still only sleep for about 4-5 hours.

If I can quit nicotine for good I feel like I can do anything, this is seriously one of the hardest things I've ever done and I'm only 4 days in. I never realized it could get this bad. Good luck to you all...",6

I'm 19 years old and i started smoking at around 14/15 because it was accessible to me. My family are huge smokers so I've grown up with it my whole life and most of my high school and college friends smoke too. 

Right now i average around a pack per day and my health is no better for it.

My plan is to stop cold turkey.

I don't have much of a game plan on how I'm going to deal/cope with the withdrawals but I'm hoping that my stubbornness will help in some way when dealing with them.

It's been roughly 4 hours (give or take) since my last and hopefully final cigarette. 

If I'm being honest, I've got my doubts. Part of me isn't ready to give it up but i know i should do it sooner rather than later which is why I'm taking the time to quit now. It's going to be hard road but it'll be worth it in the end.

The plan is to switch to vapes, as although they're not as good as quitting, they'll be better for me than smoking. After this, I'm making a timeline plan to reduce the amount of nicotine in my vapes, until eventually there is no nicotine in my vape, and quit altogether from there.

Since I have not started on my quitting journey yet, it is obviously very daunting. I know it's the addiction talking, but I do very much enjoy a smoke when I drink alcohol, and this is probably the biggest issue I have with quitting smoking.
I've had a look online and have seen that actually, one or two cigarettes when you drink or socially is almost as bad for you as smoking every day, so I've reluctantly come to terms with the idea that I'll probably never be able to have a cigarette with a drink again, for the sake of my long term health. 
However, I really don't want to see myself relapsing and having a cigarette if I do have a drink, especially in the first few months of my quitting experience. I think in time cigarettes will become repulsive to me as my taste etc comes back so I won't crave them as much, but I have some events that definitely include drinking alcohol in the coming months, but I want to be on my quitting journey is fast as possible.

My question is, in the future when I've stopped smoking and vaping altogether, if I have a vape when I have a drink, does this reset the positive effects that quitting has been doing to my body? Can vaping be considered as a bit of a cheat alternative to a cigarette, or just a no go in general?

TL;DR: I like to smoke when I drink, but don't want to ruin the health benefits quitting will be giving me. Is vaping a safer alternative to smoking on a night out, or will it reset the benefits of quitting in the same way a cigarette does?

7 days ago I was laying in bed not feeling great, thinking about how bad this habit is, this lifestyle that dominates everything. Going anywhere? Have to light up before we go in. Leaving somewhere? Have to light up before we get in the car. It goes on and on.

I was able to stop a few times, until I was basically only a social smoker. I would also vape back in 2016-2018 but always at 3-12 mg and without nic salts.

I remember asking the guy who worked at the vape shop back in 2016 if I should start smoking nicotine salts and he said whatever you do, don‚Äôt start with the salts. And then, Juul came out of course.

I bought a juul and was addicted in a matter of days. I then got a mod device and have been vaping at 5% nic salt (3-5 refills/day) until two days ago when I quit cold turkey (which might not be the best idea, actually, am looking for alternatives)

Let me tell you something : having experienced both cigarette withdrawals as well as nic salts, the latter is way, way worse. 

First, vaping is so easy but it is sooo much harder on the brain to quit when you used to chain-smoke every 5 seconds. I have the most intense cravings, I can barely stand up without my legs giving up on me. I feel like shit, everything hurts and I want to quit every 5 seconds. I have thought about vaping every fucking second since I quit. My legs are restless, I can‚Äôt concentrate. I feel like I am dying. This is so much worse than cigarette withdrawals, so much worse. If the physical symptoms aren‚Äôt gone by tomorrow, I am smoking again because this isn‚Äôt something I can handle I swear to god. Absolute torture. My head hurts so bad I‚Äôm crying while typing this.


Edit: I am not anti-vaping. I believe replacing cigarettes with vaping does work, but only if you stick to regular nicotine and not nic salts.",55

I'm trying this for who knows which time.

I have read Allen Carr for 3 times, and every time stopped but after six months started again.

I need to quit. They cost too much, they are poisonous and destroying my self-esteem.

I understand that this is just cage for the mind. They are purpose to themselves. They create this     
vicious circle and break it with just one puff. But that little dopamine is enough for me and makes me crazy. I can only last one hour, and then I start again.

I don't know what to do, I'm going mad. Every day I try to quit, but every day i fail.

Any ideas?",13

Before that i installed my apps for mobile.
Just stop for 3 days.
I realized i can't quit instantly, because i use pod with high nicotine contains.

Quit again for a few months last year and picked up vaping due to stress at work.

I'm so over it. I've been wanting to quit since I started. I told myself this morning is the last time I vape and I downloaded an app on my phone to track how long it's been since I quit. I'm tired of it being the first thing I reach for in the morning. I'm tired of feeling tired all the time, irritated when I can't have it, and most of all I'm tired of being the very active person that I am and having my lungs hurt when my muscles feel fine. I remember how it felt to exercise cardio after I quit the first time and I felt like I could go on forever. Now I feel like I could fall over any moment.

2022-01-19 08:20:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/s7pz80/my_smoking_story/,My Smoking Story,"I (50 m) have had a long painful history of smoking lots and lots of cigarettes over a span of 30 years.  The pandemic didn't help any and by May 2021 I was smoking about 40 cigarettes a day since I was WFH.  Over the years I tried quitting hundreds of times but failed. I also have a drinking problem. Also, when I drink I **always** smoke. So, in the past, I have had to quit drinking before I could even consider quitting smoking. Back in May 2021,  my health had reached a new low, I could barely breathe, I was having numerous circulation, immunity and allergy issues.  I woke up several times a night restless just so I could smoke.  My body was covered with rashes and I was constantly itching everywhere.  Every time I had a tiny cut, it would turn into a big infection requiring antibiotics.   A 40-cigarette habit meant lots and lots of health issues. Life was living hell.

By May 2021, I somehow quit drinking and also went ahead and quit smoking with the help of Nicotine patches and the Gum.   By end of July 2021, I was off the Patches.   By now my health was returning to normal.  I even fixed my diet, went sugar free and started jogging 7 miles a day and was regularly hitting the gym. By October of last year I was showing plenty of muscles. Gone was my beer belly. My six pack was beginning to show.  With all the protein shakes, a perfect all-natural diet and all day cardio/weights I was literally glowing.  I felt I was about 20 years younger.  I was muscular. The $500 a month I was saving went to pay for a new wardrobe, muscle shirts, sunglass, the works! People started treating me differently.  My well-being and confidence was sky-high. I started going to the water park just to show off my muscles.  I was living the life.

Meanwhile, since I was doing so good, I was allowing myself to chew some Nicotine gum.  At first it was 3 to 4 pieces a day (since I was busy working out and showing off my muscles).   Some days I would feel gloomy and I would chew 7 to 8 pieces.  One of those days back in October last year,  I was asking myself, ""Wouldn't it be fun to drink a few beers?"" And so I did. And since I **always** smoke when I drink, I bought me a 6-pack of beer and a pack of cigarettes.  I have to admit it was 100% fun.  I got a great buzz and I smoked about 10 cigarettes and fell asleep.  The next day I woke up, threw out all the remaining beer and cigarettes and went back to being smoke free and sober.

A month went by and again I was asking  myself ""Wouldn't it be fun to drink a few beers and smoke a few cigarettes? The last time was fun, wasn't it?"" . And so, repeat.  Over the past 3 moths, I kept repeating this pattern a few times a month.  Since I was only smoking when I drank, it felt somewhat okay.  While my health was still pretty good, I was no longer in excellent shape.

Fast forward to last week, I did the familiar 6-pack beer plus cigarettes combo.  Didn't feel all that good. Threw away all my cigarettes and went to bed. Woke up and was feeling hung over.  Decided for the first time sober to buy a cigar with my coffee.   And if you are a smoker,  you know exactly where this is going.  One cigar goes to two and so forth.  Here I am today with a 4-cigar a day habit.  I rarely go jogging anymore and I haven't been to the gym this year. I am back on junk food and here I am smoking this stupid cigar with my coffee. I feel totally disgusted. I simply don't want to settle for this new reality.

And so I just threw away my cigar and told myself :""This is it. You are now back on the 21 mg patch. No more drinking. No more smoking. No more nicotine gum either.  Back to a sensible diet.  Back to jogging and weights tomorrow""

It is Day One all over again.

**TLDR Moral of the story** ""Once you quit smoking, try to get to being Nicotine free ASAP. And as soon as you are Nicotine free, stay that way. Don't entertain any triggers (alcohol in my case).  Smoking and nicotine have **zero** benefits. Once you quit, stay quit.  Be prepared for gloomy days. Entertaining that one trigger (beer in my case) or taking that one puff is simply not worth it.  One puff always leads to smoking like you used to.""

Good luck on your journey!

The problem is, everytime I've successfully quit at home around family and support, but as soon as I get back to uni culture it all goes out the window.

I was reorganizing some apps on my phone and came across my Quit It app. It tracks the time since you've quit‚Äînothing special. I hadn't opened the app in a while. I opened it today and saw **7 years, 2 months, 8 days, 13 hours, and 14 minutes** since my last cigarette.

I used to smoke between 1/2 and 1 pack a day. When I first quit, smoking was all I could think about. I felt a void. After all, smoking was part of my identity, right? Going through old photos from college, I'd routinely see a cigarette in my hand.

Quitting was hard. There are no two ways about it, but it gets easier. Not only are there physical withdrawal symptoms, but there's also this decoupling you need to do: prying cigarettes away from your identity, your rituals, and your thoughts.

I found that app and tracked it regularly, noting each milestone and watching the time build up. Being a non-smoker (or former smoker) became a *new* part of my identity. I think that's helpful, especially in the first few years. It was a point of pride for me. But time went on, and cigarettes occupied less and less of my mind. After the huge milestone of year five, it just slipped from my attention.

This is a long-winded way to say: it gets easier. Smoking will latch on to you for dear life, but you have the power to take away *its* power. Be patient, forgiving, believing, and trusting in yourself. You'll look back and thank yourself for doing so (your lungs will thank you too).",107

I'm 30 and have been a smoker for about 11 years. I had multiple attempts to quit, with a record of 2 months without smoking, yet each attempts failed. Allen Carr's book didn't really help. I told myself that i would quit when 30. Tried to smoke the last cigarette on my 30th birthday, but that lasted for about 2 weeks.

I don't really get heave cravings, or any symptoms of nicotine addiction. In fact, i'm convinced that my addiction is psychological more than anything else. My latest attempt was 2 days ago, I haven't smoked for 2 whole days, and then today, I went outside to do a couple of things, and thoughts of buying a pack kept coming back. I tried hard to convince myself that smoking is bad. In fact, I don't even need to convince myself - i know it well. It's a really gross habit, smells terrible, smoke rubbing against your throat in a brutal way. I imagined myself in a cancer ward at 70, my wife (future imaginary wife, single atm) looking at me in horror, as I say ""at least i enjoyed myself"", and chuckled at how ridiculous that would be.

Nevertheless, as i was cycling home, my mind kept racing, with an intense inner monologue on how I shouldn't smoke. And then, suddenly, I stopped at a shop, got myself a pack and a lighter and lit up. Two very distinct things that i felt in that moment - physical disgust at the taste of the smoke, light pain from the smoke hitting my throat. Yet I also felt immense relief, thoughts slowing down and a kind of peace of mind.

Now i'm sitting, feeling like a complete failure. I don't understand what is wrong with me, and why i just can't make it. I think i might need some external support? Can anyone relate and help with advice?

I suppose i should start meditating, but it's a habit that just doesn't seem to stick..",9

It was a rough stint; I work a physical and technical job. I never thought Id quit because I couldnt imagine coping without a dart.

However, I managed to quit. I got fed up with the habit and just stopped. It was made harder because my significant other smokes heavily, and openly told me she is unwilling to quit alongside me. I overcame this too, and found a way to break the routine.

Today, I lost all my progress. I stuffed a smoke between my lips and went outside and lit the damn thing. I knew how stupid it was and I did it anyways. I did it because I was angry with myself. I did it to spite myself. How dumb is that? I was angry with my behaviour and punished myself with failure.

Why? Well I got into a heated argument with my significant other. It was a serious one, with real repercussions. Things were said that cannot be unsaid. I think our relationship will survive... I hope it does.

Here is the saving grace; we began fighting, she was much angrier than myself. I stormed outside and begin smoking. She comes outside behind me, a few minutes later, and grabs the half-burn cigarette out of my hand and tosses it into the snow, says nothing, and goes back inside.

So... we may be going through a lot, but I know she still cares. Tomorrow I will reset my counter and begin to quit smoking again. I will tell her I love her and work on healing.

I‚Äôm more of a casual drinker but on a long night out I might get a bit tipsy, being light weight doesn‚Äôt help either, three beers and I‚Äôm already mumbling.


Anyway I always felt that my biggest weakness in my quit smoking journey is when I‚Äôm out drinking or when I‚Äôm at a rave. Basically when my judgement is blurred and easier to make the wrong decisions. 


Yesterday towards the end of the night I went with a friend of mine to a dive bar of sorts, due to covid and being in California there were a lot of outside tables for people to enjoy their drinks. Well every single table had smokers, every single one. Everywhere I looked I‚Äôd see people enjoying their lovely cigarettes, I was craving them like there‚Äôs no tomorrow. I was trying hard to keep my mind off of it and kept looking at the tracking app staring at the number 11 and thinking how I‚Äôd feel sad the next morning if I gave in and smoked. 


My friend used to smoke many years ago, he kept talking about cigarettes though and how there‚Äôs no harm if we were to take one or buy a packet and just smoke a couple. He was saying how he can control it and how easy it is. I remember that mindset though, I myself had a similar one and only smoked on nights out. Eventually though it had gotten to the point where I‚Äôd really need a cig whenever I was out drinking. I‚Äôd go to parties or for drinks and ask strangers if they had a cigarette. It was horrible and didn‚Äôt want to repeat that pattern. My friend gave in and went to buy a packet, he offered me a couple of times but I kept saying no and I kept thinking how I‚Äôd regret it the next day. We even continued our conversation while he was smoking but at that point it had gotten easier. It got easier because I saw the effect of addiction on him and I actually was feeling happy I was doing well in resisting.

I also noticed I was becoming more depressed and cigarettes would only amplify that - I would need them to calm down but instead they would only increase my anxiety.

I think IQOS helped me quit in a way. Basically I wouldn‚Äôt crave traditional cigarettes anymore and find them repulsive. However, I had to deal with quitting IQOS now which wasn‚Äôt that much easier.

What helped me quit was leaving IQOS at home before going on a 2 week vacation. Since I didn‚Äôt have the e cigarette and wasn‚Äôt into smoking traditional cigarettes, the only choice was to not smoke. And when I came back home 2 weeks later the cravings weren‚Äôt as bad.

During the first three months there were several occasions when I got really stressed and almost bought cigarettes again. However, I found that going for a walk, drinking some valerian drops when needed or treating myself with candies also help. And it better long term for my health both physical and mental.

So over the past 6+ months I only smoked 2 traditional cigarettes during some social gatherings with friends. And the cravings got really rare and much less intense.

I feel like my mental health has improved tremendously, I don‚Äôt get nearly as stressed and even when I do - I don‚Äôt need cigarettes to deal with that.",34

[Probably don't read if you're struggling],"I was all gung ho and excited about quitting for the first few weeks. I wasn't even tempted during peak physical withdrawals. It was hard and I felt like a Nicholas Cage character but in a way it was really easy because I actually wanted to quit.


Now I'm just miserable. I'm extremely, extremely depressed. I don't have more energy. I don't have amazing skin. I don't have a better appetite. No newfound zest for life. It's a herculean effort to get out of bed.


I miss smoking after waking up. I miss sitting on my back porch, enjoying being outside. I miss drinking and going out to the smoking patio and talking to random drunk people. I miss the built in alone time and peace and quiet. I miss the stress relief. I miss rewarding myself after chores. I miss smoking after sex. I miss smoking after eating. There is literally no experience more pleasurable than a smoking a cigarette after a satisfying meal. It's not even just ""you only think you love smoking because you associate it with all those good things."" No I just straight up love actual smoking itself.


I started feeling depressed about a week ago. Now it's so bad and just getting worse. By depression I don't mean, ""I wish I could smoke and it's hard not to and I miss it and I'm sad about it."" It's classic depression with all the terrible negative thoughts it always brings, especially the whole 'no longer enjoying anything' bit. I just realize that quitting fucked with my dopamine or whatever, plus winter in the pnw is notoriously everyone's 13th reason and I realize that's playing a role as well.


I've tried exercising, taking vitamin D, going out for walks, going to stores, going out to eat (huge trigger actually), writing down things I'm thankful for, distracting myself, everything I can think of. I feel 1% better for like 2 seconds. Out of sheer desperation I held some crystals (lol so embarrassing and pathetic). You know what would 100% instantly help? Smoking!! I'm not even physically craving it, I just know it would fix it. I'm bi-polar and this is easily the worst I've felt since starting a good medication years ago.


It doesn't feel worth it. I don't even care about getting lung cancer in 30 years bc I'm going to get shot at a nazi checkpoint while fleeing a natural disaster in like 5 years anyway. The only thing that sucked about smoking was the gross film, feeling self conscious about smelling bad, and the nagging feeling that I ""should"" quit.


Next month I'm spending a week in California. If I don't feel better after that amount of time and sunshine I'm going to start smoking again and will never bother quitting again. I hate this!!",8

I've never been sick like this before, I can only correlate it to having asthma and smoking in the winter (two major triggers for my lungs). When I use to smoke back in high school I would get bronchitis almost every winter, it felt similar to this sickness.

id like to think i am a person with decent immunity and stamina and even pride myself for it. ive refrained taking medicine , not even a Calpol since i can remember. But this bug had me beat.

my being sick has come as a blessing in disguise really, as cigarettes taste really bad now that i have infected sinuses. i have discarded my ashtrays and lighters for good measure.   
the withdrawals aren't significant but lessons are being learnt. my weakness for the craving was obvious. but im learning/managing ways on how to overcome the craving and my weaknesses thereof.

When l finally ended both. The following happened. On February 3rd, after 32 years of smoking, I began to exercise -walking, taste food, breathe easier, sleep deeper, dreams returned, circulation improved, stronger and longer wood (oh wife definitely noticed), lost weight, looking younger, no more pausing and delaying others - get up and go, accomplishing more, enjoying life more.

I honestly thought about lying to myself and acting like that had never happened but then what would I say about the ones that followed during day?

I held myself accountable and reset my clock and now I am three days into another attempt. Hopefully there won't be any more relapsing but if there is I won't let it stop me from getting back up and trying again.

I'm nearly three months off the drink with no relapses and thought stopping smoking would be a breeze in comparison - it's not. Probably because there's absolutely no point to smoking, it's not like it gets you drunk or makes you unable to function. 

What are everyone's tips for times like this when that voice is saying ""just one won't hurt - no one will know"". How do you keep busy? How do you distract yourself?

I've thrown out my tobacco, skins and filters, trying to keep busy/ take it 10 mins at a time/ reassuring the counter-voice that's saying ""there's no point"" and ""you've gotten this far"".

I've been smoke free for 15 days and 12 hours, the longest time since I started smoking in summer of 2016. I've been 14 at the time and so smoking became intertwined with my ""grown-up"" social life - parties, going out etc. And honestly, I just miss it. I miss having a cigarette in a cafe in the city center on a summer morning. I miss going out for a smoke after taking a first shot at a party. I miss smoking while chatting with my friends. I also miss stopping on a roadtrip to smoke one, or while being on a walk. I miss the thrill of getting them while being underage. I miss making new friends while going out for a smoke at a party or in a new environment. I miss having one while coming back home after a long night out.

I actually don't miss smoking cigarettes at home that much - I can totally live without it. I spend less money and don't smell like an ashtray. But boy oh boy do I miss the social aspect of them. Having great memories that include smoking and nostalgia kicking in doesn't help a bit.

I have been on transdermal patches for about three months now. Started with 21mg 3 weeks, 14mg 6 weeks, 7mg 6 weeks and now I have a stash of about 5 more weeks of 7mg, currently on them. I think I am probably gonna get a different brand that offers cuttable and go to 4mg from there. I also have a bunch of gum but I take a 1mg gum maybe every third day or so. 

My psychiatrist was the one who advised prolonging nrt, that is why step 2 was 6 weeks from the start. After having these three months smoke free I can see myself just being on the patch forever. I have had a crazy amount of stress. I am about to pass the first semester of my masters in a field that is new to me, in my second foreign language. I've managed to reframe my thinking in other areas too. I took a fake sick leave for a week first time in my life (I am in Europe) and just studied and applied for other jobs. I got an easier better paid one and I passed that exam. I am going to therapy too, first time ever I can afford it (it is online with someone from my home country). So many intensive positive or negative, but all of those experiences without a cigarette. Husband supports me 100% but a lot of people are like you do cold turkey or nothing, you are just gonna start doing it again, you are just lying to yourself. Etc

I would like to say that I set my quitting date for two hours from now, which is the time I go to sleep, tomorrow when I wake up I will be 8 hours without smoking.

Owned up to the people in my life and they helped me realize smoking more isn't going to make me feel any better, and they'll support me, even with this slip up. My mistake was not talking to them before I smoked, or posting here for help.

I read of ton of information about the quit period, made lists of distraction tasks, rewards, etc. Got really good and ready yesterday, wrote out a whole new morning routine, got rid of all my smokes, and ""quit"" before bed last night so I would wake up already with 8+ hours under my belt this morning. 

I knew skipping the first smoke would be hard. I expected cravings, mood swings, headaches, whatever. 

But I expected that cravings would be identifiable as cravings? Like all of the advice I've read is that a craving will pass after some time, you just gotta get through it. I was ready for that, but it didn't happen. 

What did happen was that I couldn't think about anything else. At all. I wasn't prepared for the constant, unending mental current of wanting a smoke. I didn't have cravings that passed, physical urges, any of that. Just an unrelenting stream of thinking about smoking. Going through my distractions list was no different than just sitting and staring at the wall - it never went away. Even when I grabbed an old vape out of frustration and got a nicotine fix, it barely helped, which seemed counterintuitive to me. 

I caved at around 5. I'm calling it a lapse and still considering this day 1 of my quit and not beating myself up over it, though I am of course disappointed. 

Any advice for me for tomorrow? Did anyone else experience a 24/7 ""craving"" for the first day, or first few days, and how did you get through it? 

I'm still considering this a win, I was one of those smokers who lit up within 5 minutes of waking up, so making it a full 19h without a smoke is am accomplishment as far as I'm concerned. But I could use some advice for tomorrow.",38

Motivational quotes please?","For years (around 6 i think) I‚Äôve been led around by my addiction. I love chainsmoking. Daily I cough up handfuls of brown and yellow phlegm- often stringy, with black spots. I don‚Äôt even know how many times i‚Äôve seen blood in my phlegm now. 

This is just an unnecessary, expensive bill that I make myself pay. I got a free trial of ‚Äúlucy‚Äù nicotine gum to help with my habitual urge. 

I want my skin to look nicer. I want my singing voice to be the best it can be. I want to spend my money on things that are fun. I don‚Äôt want to worry about blood vessels and hernias. I don‚Äôt want to cough all the time. I want to be free. 

When I was a teenager, I knew someone who had COPD from smoking. They would take their oxygen thing off to smoke cigarettes. They died a couple of years ago. This has always stuck in my mind. 

How do I stop when I don‚Äôt care about my health / myself? I don‚Äôt hate myself entirely, I just don‚Äôt care if I die early really. I want to change this because I know it is illogical, but honestly it‚Äôs hard to tell myself no to brief moments of feeling good. 

Inspirational quotes are really helpful to me, please share any that you like!",23

I feel ashamed and also slightly proud, that I do feel ashamed. Tomorrow is a new day and think I can stick it out for another week. One week at a time, right? Plus, a dry week would help heaps in dealing with the symptoms :) 

Just a call to action to those struggling that a small set back isn't the end of the world and, as long as the intention is right, the consequences will follow. 

From tomorrow I will stop drinking for a while (at least until March) to support my primary goal of quitting smoking entirely. 

As Allen Carr says, find the reason why you smoke and the rest will follow. In my case, this is tied to extreme social anxiety and the need to escape any form of social intimacy. 

I wish the rest of you the best of luck!!!!",23

Mentally this week has been a roller coaster to say the very least. My poor husband could not be more supportive but I feel like a caged lion sometimes. Other times I wonder if was I always this pissed but repressing it with smokes, able to take a 5 minute break to myself or is this just the withdrawal making me bananas? 

One thing that keeps me from picking it up is that I‚Äôve quit for a week or 2 before and I remembered how gross that first smoke tasted. I keep telling myself it won‚Äôt even taste right that whenever a craving strikes. 

I purchased a zero nicotine vape for my upcoming trip where I know I will drink socially, just to make sure I don‚Äôt cave & bum a smoke. Anyone with experience using this successfully or advice in avoiding it altogether would love your input!

Unnecessary rage followed by deep depression, crying and ideation, all in a span of an hour or so. Is this common or just a me problem? It makes it so difficult to push thru without wanting to verbally hurt others or physically hurt myself.

I stopped smoking for a few years. I started by reducing and eventually I stopped. My motivation at the time was due to my romantic partner. She never asked me to quit but didn't like smoking and didn't want to kiss after I smoked. I would still have an occasional cigarette when drinking but that was maybe once per month. 

Years later and after breaking up, I started smoking full time again. I quit drinking entirely by going through rehab and have been sober for nearly three years. I've tried applying what I learned in rehab but it doesn't seem to fit. I know that having a medically assisted withdrawal helped with alcohol addiction. It was also at a time when I was fully prepared to get sober. 


What I am asking you for is your method or experience. How have you been able to maintain not smoking for more than two weeks?",1

I've bounced between a bunch of nicotine products for several years: dip, cigarettes, vapes, gum, snus.

I'm a programmer and not in a great mental state in the first place (ADD, depression, anxiety), so the brain fog is really messing with my ability to be productive. During a small meeting yesterday where I was supposed to delegate some tasks, my brain just shut down and I couldn't remember how the pieces of my project fit together and what needed to be done. I'm not in trouble or anything but it's embarrassing and frustrating. Since I quit I'm logging even fewer hours than usual.

My nicotine use has been a secret from everybody (wife, current coworkers, rest of family) so even though they're good people I can't tell them what is going on to get any support. This also means I don't have a good excuse for taking time off.

Aside from work, the cravings are really bad and just getting worse. For some reason, I'm specifically craving cigarettes even though I haven't had one for like two years. I'm an inch away from going out to get some. I've been using regular gum to help but I ran out and I know if I go to the store I'll get some kind of nicotine.

I don't have the discpline or the mental energy to exercise. I did buy a DDR pad and I think I'll enjoy that and it'll be good for me but it's not arriving for a couple of weeks and I don't think I can last until then.

Smoking is the best thing in the whole world

No lies. It is the BEST thing. It creates a problem and it solves it. It is like winning the lottery fifteen times a day.
I knew about heroin. I knew about cocaine. I knew heroin would feel like the best orgasm I've ever had times a thousand. I knew cocaine would make me feel sexier than god but also like, if I got in a fight with god, I would win. I knew X would make every weekend better so long as I had it. I stayed FAR FAR away from that shit. Good things are good until you don't have them and then life sucks beyond the telling of it. I had a handle on that.
The only thing people told me about cigarettes was how much they sucked. Kissing a smoker was like licking an ashtray. They'll rob you blind. You'll die early. You'll smell bad. You'll talk through a hole in your throat. I watched them slowly march my father closer to death. Don't smoke.....easy enough.

Here's the problem: if cigarettes are so nasty and terrible you have nothing to worry about. Have one. Have another. You'd never be stupid enough to fall into that trap, right? You can be that magic unicorn that can just have one socially with your friends, right? After all, people who get hooked get hooked before they turn 18 and you're nineteen so you're past the cutoff? Plus you're so smart! You'd never do something as dumb as getting addicted to the dumbest, most loserish drug on the market, right?

It's never going to be you. Because smoking seems so innocuous. You know that 1/3 people who try heroin are addicted the first time out, but how can smoking, something so stupid, be so dangerous? It's just one cigarette....and the first time that's true! The first time you don't like it and it was as awful as you were expecting and you're completely disarmed for what's coming for you.
Then it's a long weekend of drinking in college and your friends smoke and they keep going outside to do so and you get curious again or you want to be ""in"" and the first one did NOTHING do you have the second. Then the eighth. And then it's only on the weekends. And then it's only while you drink. And then you ""cut back"" and only smoke when your friends have them (and they ALWAYS have them). You kind of know, in the back of your head, that you want them but you'd have to be stupid (remember?) to fall in that pit. You're crazy smart and good at life and you know all the facts and you'd never be that kid.

Here's where it gets serious: something terrible happens. You get broken up with, your dog gets hit by a car, you fail a class, something goes to hell in a hand basket. So you reward yourself with this self-destructive thing. Just for now. Just because this shitty thing has befallen you. So you go and buy some and you feel dirty doing it but feeling dirty is part and parcel with the shitty thing that happened. And you feel like an adult. And you feel like you're coping even though you're doing anything but.

Cigarettes are the best part of your day. The feeling of wanting one and then getting one is straight up euphoria. In a world of turmoil and despair, they become your favorite life raft. They make everything better, they make everything that sucks immediately suck less. And that's why they are IMPOSSIBLE to quit. You know you're sinking, and you will do nothing. You'll suddenly come to the realization that you've become a smoker (how the fuck did that happen?) but you won't care. Because the best part of your day is this shitty, expensive, debilitating thing. It's like having a crush on someone who doesn't love you back or having a really arrogant best friend. You love them all the more for how much the situation sucks.

At some point you realize you have to quit but you can't. Shitty things keep happening. Your job sucks, your relationship sucks, your classes suck. Finals are coming, your taxes are due, your friend is imploding in front of your face. Any stress, any little thing, becomes unbearable and you need that solution/problem in one to make it seem surmountable. You'll feel like your whole life is caving in and then you have a smoke and you're fine again. For twenty minutes. And twenty minutes is really all you need...for now. Until that time passes and you need it again. And in the back of your head you are RANTING at yourself about how dumb this is and how much you hate yourself for being this person but the pleasure, the relief, drowns it out.

You don't get it. You can't. If you never went down the rabbit hole, it won't make sense to you. If you have gone down the rabbit hole, it won't really make sense either. But you will get why you do it to a certain extent.

We all made the decision to never smoke. Some of us just fucked it up without meaning to. It was not all at once or with intention. It just happens. All the health facts and scary stories in the world won't change it. The thing that will change it is arming people with the foreknowledge that smoking is the best thing ever. That's what would have saved me.

At some point you realize you have to quit but you can't. Shitty things keep happening. Your job sucks, your relationship sucks, your classes suck. Finals are coming, your taxes are due, your friend is imploding in front of your face. Any stress, any little thing, becomes unbearable and you need that solution/problem in one to make it seem surmountable. You'll feel like your whole life is caving in and then you have a smoke and you're fine again. For twenty minutes. And twenty minutes is really all you need...for now. Until that time passes and you need it again. And in the back of your head you are RANTING at yourself about how dumb this is and how much you hate yourself for being this person but the pleasure, the relief, drowns it out.
You don't get it. You can't. If you never went down the rabbit hole, it won't make sense to you. If you have gone down the rabbit hole, it won't really make sense either. But you will get why you do it to a certain extent.

We all made the decision to never smoke. Some of us just fucked it up without meaning to. It was not all at once or with intention. It just happens. All the health facts and scary stories in the world won't change it. The thing that will change it is arming people with the foreknowledge that smoking is the best thing ever. That's what would have saved me. 

Here's to day 5 all over again",34

I knew I wouldn't really feel ""done"" with the road to being quit until I had achieved something more than just being a non-smoker. As of now, I'm still a smoker. Just like an alcoholic without alcohol is still an alcoholic. I just don't physically indulge the practice. There's no real desire for me to quit, other than the things I ""know"" I should do.

Maybe others get something from it, maybe there are tips for me to stay strong. 

I started smoking at age 19 because I worked a job where everyone smoked on their 10 min break.  I'm sure that's a common thread. Smoked regularly (maybe 10-12 per day, rarely a full pack) for the next 10 years. Then I moved in with my fiancee, who begged me to quit over the smell. We reached a compromise where I switched to vaping. Got to smoke my nicotine and not stink. I even turned the concentration down to .03 thinking I was being healthier. Back then, that was probably true.

Fast forward about 5 more years to the pandemic. I was fortunate to be able to work from home rather than lose my job. What I didn't notice was my nicotine intake had increased. At the office, I had to take an elevator downstairs and go outside to vape. At home, the vape sat on my desk next to the keyboard. Always in arm's reach. I was vaping continuously all day long without noticing for over a year. Not great. 

About 6 months ago, I dropped my vape and broke it beyond repair. Rather than buy a new one, I decided to use the opportunity to try and quit. I didn't last a day, broke down that afternoon and bought a pack of my old cigarettes that I smoked before the switch to vaping. The wife (same finacee) was not impressed. 

By this point I was realizing how much more nicotine I was vaping at home, so I promised myself I'd smoke just one cig a day at the peak of the worst craving. My logic was: one cig is healthier than 100+ vape hits, right? One cig a day became two, became the occasional three, and hovered there. I was heading full circle back to where I started. 

We recently took a family vacation, 5 days out of the country, and I left the cigs behind with the idea that vacation might make it easier to quit. Turned out to be correct. I was distracted enough by the vacation, away from all of my routines at home that I connect with smoking, that my cravings were simply not as powerful. I didn't give myself enough downtime to dwell on them. The worst was mornings and evenings when I wasn't out and about for another day of vacation fun. My hotel was smoke free so I'd have to wander out into the neighborhood, buy cigs and smoke in an alley or something. This was enough of an inconvenience to power through those morning/evening cravings. 

I've been back for two days, so I'm now 7 full days without vaping or smoking. I will say that this is the hardest part so far. The cravings feel extreme. I was hoping that 5 days would flush enough nicotine out of my system that I'd be over the worst of it, but maybe I'm just in the mental phase. It's associating the smoking with other things. ""Just finished dinner, time for a sm-... oh yeah, I can't do that."" Then I'm fighting it for what feels like hours. 

I am glad the vacation was the opportunity I wanted it to be to get the quitting started. I'm hopeful that I can get back to my old routine and disassociate it from smoking. I am totally unfamiliar with this part of the journey since this is the farthest I've personally made it. Any input is appreciated.

Tl;dr: if you're having trouble quitting, try getting out of town for a few days to do something fun and use that to kickstart the quitting process. Feel free to share tips for the one week mark.",7

I‚Äôve (27M) wanted to quit smoking for a while now and made a few quit attempts in the past year (5 days cold turkey, 3 months only vaping).

I was planning on trying again soon anyway, but I‚Äôm having last minute surgery on Friday (tonsillectomy) and it‚Äôs strongly recommended not to smoke 48 hours before or 2 weeks after the surgery.

I don‚Äôt want to risk complications and ideally i‚Äôd use this opportunity to quit permanently, but I don‚Äôt think the pressure to quit (or even stop temporarily) this week is helping.

I‚Äôve never really been someone who can stay away from cigarettes for even a day and the fact that I‚Äôd risk my health to keep smoking is scary and kinda demotivating. If i can‚Äôt quit for this, how am I ever going to stop?

I used Allen Carr‚Äôs easyway for my first quit attempt and i‚Äôm trying to get through the sequel as quickly as possible. 

But because it didn‚Äôt work the first time, it feels like the magic has gone. I don‚Äôt know if I can get into the ‚Äúhappy non smoker‚Äù mindset in 48 hours lol.

Have any ex smokers here managed to temporarily stop due to medical advice? If so, how did you get the motivation and were you able to stay smoke free after?",2

I'm 30 f, started smoking heavily 5 months ago, a pack a day. I would inhale strongly so i can get the buzz.


Last week i noticed a weird focused pain in the middle of my upper back, it lasted a few days, just woke up and the pain is in the lower middle back. 

My cough isn't bad, usually 3 times a day. My right side abdomen hurt a little but it's gone now.

Needless to say I've stopped 3 days ago. 

I've finally had the courage to call my doctor just now and i have an appointment tomorrow in the afternoon.


I'm terrified, is it possible that I'm at a later stage just from smoking 5 months? I'm convinced i have it. 


If they dismiss it, how can i convince them to do another test? Or what is the best type of test that i should ask for? I'm clueless",4

 I see smoking now as the dirty addiction that it is without any cravings whatsoever, I have been working out these 3 weeks and I feel strong and confident. My anxiety of talking to people has almost disappeared and I work more efficiently than I ever did.

Last but not least, the sexual relationships with my girlfriend have improved very much. I used to think I had PE problems, and I was finished after one time, now I last longer and can easily do it 3 times in a row.

The real problem for me right now is that I am gaining weight.

With COVID I started putting on some pounds; I was able to lose most of it and get back down to a manageable weight with some basic dieting, but dieting is a LOT harder right now. I'm not exceptionally heavy or anything (hit 170 last night), but I prefer to be sub-150, especially because every extra pound is that much more weight for me to carry on my broken body (and I don't want to buy new clothes).

I suffer from severe chronic pain due to arthritis, and exercise is exceptionally difficult for me, especially during winter. 30 minutes of exercise results in 1-2 hours minimum of being incapable of doing anything due to pain.. And sometimes I can't even physically complete that 30 minutes of exercise.

Just FYI, I'm a web developer for a living, and a game industry writer/streamer as a main side-hustle. I've been working from home for years now, so I've had a fairly sedentary lifestyle.

Before COVID I'd at the very least get out of the house each weekend to be around people (I'm SD autistic with noise sensitivity issues and difficulty interacting with people if I don't practice) and be active within reason, typically spending a few hours doing things like visiting a local coffee shop, walking the mall, and shopping at a few different places that have floors I can actually walk on without pain and plenty of places to stop and rest to keep my pain manageable.

Now the only time I get out is when I absolutely have to (due to autoimmune issues and living in a high-risk area I try to limit my exposure to the general populous), and even then it's typically to places like Walmart.. Where I have to use a motorized cart because I can't physically walk the whole store because of the hard concrete floors.

Anybody have any suggestions/tricks to help? With winter I can't just go for a walk outside because the cold makes the pain worse (and right now there is a lot of ice everywhere, which is an exceptionally risky proposition). I have a bike that I've converted into a fixed exercise bike, but that's not exactly easy to use with my pain anymore.

Dieting is going to be my best prospect, but convincing myself that I don't need to eat something super unhealthy as a reward for not smoking is proving to be harder than quitting itself :)",4

It‚Äôs been exactly 1 day 19 hours and 21 minutes since I have quit smoking. 
I initially went cold turkey off nicotine but I had too many emotional problems so I just bought a nicotine patch with the lowest dosage 3 hours ago and it‚Äôs working great. 
For me, I don‚Äôt really have the urge to smoke but it just makes me so moody. 
I have noticed that my withdrawal symptoms are really bad since I was both vaping 5% and smoking ciggs‚Ä¶ 


Some withdrawal effects that I experienced that were hard on me were 
- trouble falling asleep 
- sleep paralysis 
- mood switch (unstable mood)
- ringing in ear 
- fatigue 
- headache 
- coughing


But some great amazing aspects I benefited already are 
- phlegm is gone (like my throat feels so clean lol)
- nose doesn‚Äôt feel dry 
- can breathe so much better
- less pimple showing up (I am getting my period tomorrow so I usually break out a lot) 
- learned how to control my frustration 
- saved so much time that I would have spent on smoking 
- saving money! 

The benefits are worth the short term withdrawal symptoms and I hope I never ever pick up cigg again. I actually have been disgusted by the smell of it it makes me gag lol I guess I‚Äôm just a really sensitive person. 
Take care everyone and happy no smoking!

I do like to smoke weed every now and then, though, but stopped rolling joints with normal tobacco since I don't want to go back to having nicotine in my system, anymore. So now, I've been looking for a good tobacco alternative because I usually don't smoke blunts. 

I tried some Indian nicotine-free herbal cigarettes in the beginning but they were really harsh on my lungs and the act of smoking it involved a lot of coughing. Also - I don't know whether this was really the cause of it but - I got an awful lung infection afterwards that only went away once I stopped smoking that shit. Then I tried rolling my joints with camomile tea (after a friend recommended it to me) and that was better but it still hurt more than actual cigarettes. I never had problems smoking joints containing normal tobacco before but I don't want to go back to that. 

So, now I'm still searching for a good alternative. Any recommendations? Are there any people in this subreddit that also still smoke joints once in a while? How do you do it?",1

I initially quit 4 years ago and stayed quit for 3.5 years! Unfortunately, my dad was diagnosed with liver cancer 6 months ago. First I started with having a cigar to wind down and de-stress at the end of the day. You know the story, that 1 cigar evolved to smoking 5 throughout the day. My dad's cancer was terminal. I told myself that when he passed, I would put them down again. He died October 20, 2021. Last week I finally started feeling like I wanted to quit, so I got myself some patches yesterday and here I am. 


I plan to use the same method I used last time. I use patches, but don't necessarily deny myself the ability to smoke if the urge/withdrawals get uncomfortably strong. Last time, I had been using patches for 2-3 weeks before I went a day without smoking a single cigarette. I had my morning cigar and coffee before I stuck my patch on, so we'll see where the day takes me from here. Glad to have a place to come now where others are in the same boat.

I've quit a few times before, and the only time I've lost weight after quitting was when I was 1) on the 7mg nicotine patches AND 2) eating very clean and exercising.

I guess I'm looking for some encouragement from people here who didn't gain weight after quitting to quell my anxiety. Obviously being a non-smoker is WAY more important than being 5-10 pounds heavier, but I've been dealing with body dysmorphia for most of my life and this is very triggering for me.

Can an ENT help with the bad sinus symptoms that linger on for months?,"I've always had bad sinuses, esp w/barometric pressure changes due to the weather. So when I tried  to quit smoking last time, I made it to a couple months...but the sinus symptoms were horrible. I experienced a very weird dissociative feeling, kind of like feeling spaced out all the time. I believe it was due to my sinuses. I had constant sinus pressure & at times it felt like someone was literally pressing on the bridge of my nose. I felt like the feeling would never go away, so I started smoking again. It went away alright...but I was smoking again;)

Has anyone solicited the help of an ENT to either check their sinuses and/or prescribe something like a nasal spray to relieve sinus symptoms. I know the standard nasal sprays like afrin should not be used for more than a day or two. I did already try using a neti pot regularly.

I'm aware of the ""smokers flu"" that occurs immediately after quitting which I got thru, but the other sinus issues were too much. I don't  believe it was the actual nicotine withdrawal bothering me b/c I was using the patch as directed which cut cravings.

There could very well be a medical reason for the sinus issues all my life (even prior to smoking). I do have a deviated septum. I guess I'm just afraid of looking stupid asking an ENT these questions and possibly have them come down on me for smoking. I know it's bad. I know I need to quit. I just need help controlling the ongoing symptoms.

Have been smoking since 14, now 29. Before quitting I smoked tobacco every hour or 30 minutes when I‚Äôm stressed, and I often felt dizzy during the day because of it. That‚Äôs the reason why I thought I needed to quit now, can‚Äôt afford wasting time on dizziness anymore.

Once I gave up for almost two years because my ex didn‚Äôt like that I smoked, started again when we broke up. Later I gave up another time, for one year, because I thought I had problems breathing, started again when I realized it was just back pain haha. Both times I gave up because of outer circumstances. Back then I saw only positive things in smoking like easier socialization and I simply didn‚Äôt know that it was so bad for health. I was young and didn‚Äôt feel how harmful it was. And decisions to quit were not serious. I didn‚Äôt have strong emotions while quitting and I had no emotions while starting again.

Both times it was easy to quit. No cravings, maybe rare moments of irritation but that‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt remember thinking about cigs at all during these pauses.

This time is a bit different because I took a conscious decision to quit for good and I really have cravings for the first time. It‚Äôs my seventh day today and at the beginning I was aggressive. I wanted to destroy haha. And I had difficulties concentrating. But still, you know, it‚Äôs fine, it lasted only for a few days. What I feel is not unbearable.

Anyway I wanted to check when cravings stop for good, so I came here. And I saw that for many people quitting feels much more difficult than it is for me (can it be because of American cigs? I‚Äôm from Germany, I think we may have weaker tobacco). I am reading about negative experiences here and I think I feel worse because of it. Before I didn‚Äôt think that quitting can be difficult and that it can last for so long. Or maybe I feel the same but don‚Äôt put emphasis on difficulties and distract myself so that it seems better. In any case I feel that reading about struggles makes me struggle.

Does anyone feel the same?",13

They definitely have been part of why I smoked for so long. I did my first cigarette at age 12 or 13, stealing tobacco and filter from my mom to smoke with a girl I liked at the time. I didn't like it but surely started to buy some packs with my pocket money and smoked from time to time with my friends.          
When I got to high school at 15 I started to smoke at each and every breaks. Times were fun and I felt badass to do so (what a dumb I was). I was able to stop for three months before my final high school diploma, but as soon as I went to higher education school, with my own room and freedom, I started smoking again. A lot (20 rolled cigarettes a day). This was 2010.        
Fast forward 2017, I still smoked a lot, tobacco and weed, but I managed to quit for one year and three months. Using a vape for weed at first then not even vaping in the end. I was new on reddit but I already found this wonderful sub and was lurking a lot. Had my badge too.        
But I had relationship problems at this time, and bought a pack of cigarettes that I didn't open for three days. Then we had a fight with my ex, I opened the 20 pack and smoked it all... I started smoking again. It lasted from April 2018 to July 2021.
           
I quitted again on July the 8th 2021, 6 months ago ! Since then everything is going fine. I was ready to do so. Like everyone of us, the start was hard, but after few months it is so easy to keep going ! I don't even think about it and blame myself for starting again back in 2018.          
But really, on the first days, weeks and months of quitting, this community have been such a positive thing ! Even just being a lurker is so helpful. Thank you very much to y'all participating in this sub-reddit because I think it makes such a positive difference.

Last time I posted I was almost a week in. All I've gotta say is this path is hard man. I'd say week 3 was the hardest as I had the highest cravings then. I just wanted to share how I'm doing it and maybe get some feedback. 

So when I quit smoking I planned it out. I did not set a date but instead decided to quit after my last pack of cigarettes. To prepare for that I started buying Velo nicotine pouches in the cinnamon flavor at 7mg of nicotine. I decided I was going to do that for a month before dropping to the 4mg pouches. But during week 3 I was getting my truck cleaned out as I was selling it. I found a full unopened pack of smokes. I debated having one but decided to stick to my goal. I tossed that pack in the freezer because I couldn't bring myself to throw it away...

That made everything much harder. I knew it was there and available any time I wanted. It was on my mind every day. My in-laws came over for a cookout one day during week 4 and I gave them that pack. My smoking craving started to cease and I was back on track to putting this chapter behind me. 

Switching to 4mg pouches took a couple days to adjust but I started feeling better. I did not limit myself to how often I could have one and just used a pouch any time I felt a craving. Has been working so far. So now with the beginning of the year I was going to quit the pouches. At 1 month and 29 days I ran out of nicotine pouches and decided to use cinnamon jolly ranchers.  HOLY SHIT THE CRAVING HIT ME HARD! My mood tanked, depression hit hard, and it feels like everything is 100000% harder to do. I almost bought another pack of cigarettes but my wife helped talk me into using the pouches a little while longer. I felt like a failure. I want to end nicotine but I couldn't do it yet. My wife reminded me that I still have not smoked and therefore I am not a failure but just needed to take it a little slower. 

So here I am in month 2 now still using 4mg Velo pouches and jolly ranchers. I need help with stopping this nicotine habit. If anyone has any ideas to get past the mental struggle I'm all ears. I'm done with this habit and I will be nicotine free one day and not blow my money or health on the tobacco industry. I love this sub and frequent it often, even if I don't post or comment much. You all can do it as I'm still going too.

Thanks for reading and take it one day at a time",19

Ten years ago it hurt to take a deep breath and physical exertion made my heart feel like it was going to burst out of my chest. Ten years later I'm an ultramarathon runner and in the best shape of my life. 

I'm not posting to brag, but instead to hopefully give back, encourage, and provide hope to those of you who are where I was 10 years ago. It's not easy, despite the book title, but it's not nearly as hard as you think it is. You haven't done anything to permanently damage yourself. It does get better. The cravings go away, the dreams go away, the pooping gets easier, and you learn how to deal with the issues that remain in a healthy and productive way.

One day at a time, one decision at a time. Don't focus on the forever, focus on the now. In my dozens of failed attempts to quit, I was always overwhelmed thinking about how hard it was to deny a craving, and that I needed to keep this up forever, and that's just impossible. It's not like that though, and that's what the easy way taught me -- Give yourself the toolkit to say no to your current craving, and the future cravings will take care of themselves. Each time you say no, you damage that lil dude telling you to smoke. Eventually he dies, and only a stronger, healthier you remains.

Stopping smoking is the best decision I've ever made. If I can do it, you can do it. Y'all got this.

It‚Äôs all that‚Äôs been on mind! I‚Äôm constantly ruminating about it and in my free time I‚Äôm always on the internet trying to find answers for my concerns but I couldn‚Äôt find  answers for some of the questions I had that‚Äôs why I came to you. I‚Äôve got a couple of questions. I‚Äôm in dire need of advice and would thoroughly appreciate it. (I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy)

1) What I‚Äôm most scared of is the insomnia. What if it stays ? I‚Äôve got three antipsychotic pills and I‚Äôve been thinking of taking it when the insomnia gets really bad. In the past I‚Äôve actually managed to quit smoking before (I relapsed on the second week. )I had insomnia but it only lasted for two days. Will it be the same this time too? And after quitting on what day do you get insomnia ? I think I had insomnia on the fourth day. What was your experience? And how long was it before your sleep cycle resumed to normal ? 

2- Since I‚Äôm obsessing about trying to quit smoking, (it‚Äôs my first waking thought and it‚Äôs all I think about) I‚Äôve gotten a lot of pre-anxiety. I‚Äôm scared of the withdrawals so much so, I haven‚Äôt even quit but I puked last night because of the anxiety. I‚Äôm really scared of the withdrawals and insomnia. Imagine actually quitting and having my anxiety heightened by multiple folds. What can help me stop obsessing about quitting and getting so much pre-anxiety?

3- I‚Äôve been trying to reduce the number of cigarettes I smoke. It‚Äôs really hard. I keep cheating myself and breaking promises to myself. But I‚Äôve successfully gone from 10 to roughly 4 a day. My question is, would my withdrawal symptoms and insomnia be less severe if I‚Äôm a light smoker ? (My plan is to cut down to 2 per day for a month and then quit for good)


Edit ! 

I managed to quit and got the answers for these myself. 

1) In my case the insomnia lasted a good one week but I went to see a psychiatrist and he gave me some benzos for a week which helped me regulate my sleep and now I‚Äôm back to sleeping like I used to, if not more. And no just one week of benzos wasn‚Äôt enough to create dependence and besides I only used it a couple of times. On the fourth day I didn‚Äôt need it. 

2) There‚Äôs no two ways around it ! I just had to do it. I was in  the contemplation stage and from there I had to go to the  action stage.  The first day wasn‚Äôt bad. The second day was the worst.  The third day. I felt it getting easier. And on the fourth day my mental state was back to normal. I had a lot of anxiety and an impending sense of doom. I don‚Äôt know if this was the best method but I had a lot of beers to ease the symptoms. It really helped. Honestly it was all much easier than I had made it to be in my head.

3-  I didn‚Äôt have a really challenging time and my withdrawals were over within three days (although cravings last for weeks) and I think I owe it to the fact that I didn‚Äôt smoke as much. So cutting down before quitting definitely helps. 

The takeaway: The physical withdrawals are hard (anxiety, insomnia etc) but still , I‚Äôd say it was much easier than I had expected. It can be done. It‚Äôs true what they say. Quitting isn‚Äôt hard, staying quit is.",2

Her father, her mother and her three brothers smoke (my gf doesn't). Of course, I cheerfully joined my in-laws and smoked industrial amounts of tobacco for about a week. After that my gf started refusing my kisses because of my breath. Not sure why, but to me it was a major wake-up call. I quit on the spot.

The firsts weeks were hell, especially because we were meeting all of her old friends (and a couple of her exes) and I just.could.not.emotionally.handle it with all the mental and physical strain of the nicotine withdrawal. Nevertheless, and all credit's due to her, she hanged though and helped me through the process.

Almost 6 months later,  I don't see why I'd ever start smoking again. I feel great. After the summer we moved in together and, funnily enough, it was now her that smoked a cigarette or two at parties. Well she won't anymore, at least not for the next 9 months *wink wink* (we haven't told anyone irl, so keep it hush-hush reddit).

I'm giving them up permanently this time. I finally accepted that I am not the type of person who can have either one once in a while without it turning back into a full blown addiction.

I am slowly accepting that the same thing applies to cigarettes for me.

My past quit smoking attempts have all eventually been self-sabotaged with the thought of having ""just one"" smoke. Or thoughts of just smoking on the weekend etc.

I also hit the point where, after 16 years of smoking, my morning smoke doesn't even give me a buzz anymore. So they don't get me ""high"" anymore and I just ""need"" them in order to feel sane because I go crazy without them. I even abstained for a full day just for the first smoke to do virtually nothing for me.

So I guess that's it. I'm starting a new job in a few days so I'm not going to quit yet because I know it's going to be stressful adapting to the new job.

But, once I've settled in, I'm going to quit.

And this time, unlike the previous times, I will accept that I can never take another puff.",11

So Im 30 but I never told my parents I smoke and I always managed to keep it secret because I just dont smoke whenever Im at home even if its two weeks and Im completely fine somehow, dont really miss it when Im at my parents.

So basically everytime I visit them, Im nicotine free and now that I work from home I usually stay for extended periods, especially during Christmas its almost 3 weeks. So last year I also used that time to quit but as soon as I came back to my place I broke down on my first day back and started smoking, if you check my post history I posted last year around the same time. So then I tried again on Easter when I stayed with them for like a week. Again failed after I came back and told myself I cant quit now that weather is becoming nice and I will quit in winter when it gets cold.

Of course I continued smoking even when it was already freezing so then I told myself I will quit when I go home. So I didnt smoke from 16th of December til 3rd of January. It seemed to be going better than last year cause I didnt break down on my first day back working this Monday, but I had some errands to run downtown and of course I bought a pack, smoked three and threw away the rest.

I also bought 4 mini cigars for big cravings and have just one left.

Then on Tuesday I had to go somewhere as well and again bought a pack, smoked a few but this time I also took 3 with me and threw away the pack. And today and yesterday I just couldnt handle it, the mornings are so hard for me so both days I drove to a gas station to buy cofee, cigs, smoked a few with the coffee , took three with me and threw away the pack.

I just dont fucking understand how my brain works. Whenever I go to my parents I am fine, I do have some headaches on first days and some brain fog but nothing too bad.

Then when I return to my place its like day one again even though I was smoke free for almost 3 weeks :(

I already tried patches, non-nicotine vape, read Allan Carr book twice, I also have the illustrated version which I read like three times, I keep reading whyquit.com and there are moments when Im like fuck yeah, Im gonna beat it, I dont need it, but then I wake up in the morning craving like hell :(

And the worst part is that for me its really not just a 10 min craving, for me it feels like Im craving 24/7, I lose all motivation for everything. I tell myself I will just do squats whenever I have a craving but when it hits me I just cant get myself to exercise Im like completely frozen and just cant do it, my brain just dreams about cigs constantly.

I otherwise exercise every day and cigs are holding me back, I would love be able to run 10km anytime , but because of cigs my max is 8km which I did only once and of course it was when I didnt smoke last year around Christmas when I was with my parents so I know I could be doing much better if I could quit.

But whenever I dont smoke I dont even wanna exercise :( 

I just dont know what else to do, I also have a pack of nicotine gums but for some reason dont use them when I have a craving I just go to the gas station to smoke a few and then In kinda fine for the rest of the day but those mornings are killing me.

I feel like there is no hope for me but as they say never give up. But I feel so depressed I dont want to live in this hell , but I also dont want to shorten my life because of cigs.

My brain constantly comes up with excuses how Im still young and maybe I can smoke another year and then quit but we all know thats bullshit.

I feel tired as fuck when trying to quit but I cant sleep. I wish I could just sleep it off for a week but even though I feel like Im barely keeping my eyes open, whenever I try to take a nap or just sleep at night I cant fall asleep.

I hate this and dont know what else to do :(",5

Both times I went through a brief withdrawal and then it passed.  

Then over a month later I felt an unraveling. Extreme sensitivity and ungroundedness.  The inability to be present and feel joy.  Relationships of mine were very challenged.  

It took over a year for my emotions to get back to normal. I am seeing the same exact pattern happen again. 

This whole 2-4 week thing seems to be for a lucky cohort of people. It feels like dopamine is just absent. Are there others like me who have long term brain chemistry readjustments?  How does one deal?  I definitely fear a repeat of my quit experience years ago and really feeling like the mental/relationship cost is not worth what could be an occasional cigarette or vape now and then.

I hardly think about it nowadays, and I don't even mind the smell of smoke nearby.    
Among those times I think about it, there are the triggers (but only 20% of them) and the times where I actively pat myself on the back and proactively remind myself to never let my mind use my current state to rationalize smoking ""casually"".  It's about killing that inner conversation in the egg.  
It would actually feel weird to smoke at this point : why on earth would I do that ? In what universe could that be worth it ? What I am enjoying the most about it all, is the sense of freedom and self-authority, which is far superior to the feelings of smoking, and an incomparably better fondation for the psyche than to have to live with a relapse and the ideas of being a slave to automatic impulses.  
I still get those ""tingly"" feelings in my chest which I used to respond to with a smoke, but that's the thing, they are feelings : information about my internal state and reactions, and most of the time, they are feelings of focus, enthusiasm etc. They don't need to be buried under nicotine, they don't need to be remedied or dealt with. I'd bet a lot of smokers have to learn something similar : mental oriented nervous people who feel more comfortable ""dealing"" wit their feelings rather than letting them be. 

At this point I have faced a lot of my triggers. The most difficult one remains socialisation and in those cases I allow myself to smoke on an nicotine-free herbal blend with a pipe. 

Keep strong everybody, even just one month is really worth it, not only for the money, health and all, but also for the self-esteem (not that we should have low self-esteem for smoking or relapsing : to manage to stand by a decision and go through with it is a self-esteem booster and we should keep reminding ourselves of the feat for however long necessary).",46

First, I've been reading through the page for a while and wow.  I am so proud of and impressed by all of you!!  Way to go!!!  

I recently quit drinking (\~76 days or so).  That has been surprisingly easy, and I thought I would need a longer stretch of sobriety under my belt before tackling this particular monster but I feel ready. 

I have a 2 week supply of patches on the way from my state's quit smoking initiative and have set a 'quit day' (may go buy some patches or lozenges so I can go ahead and start to stop instead of waiting on the mail).

As easy as quitting drinking was (again, surprisingly easy), I am having big doubts on this one.  Not for lack of want - I'm 47 and have been smoking since I was like 14 or 15.  That's a lot of years and a lot of created nicotine receptors.

I've stopped smoking probably hundreds of times and will always come back to it. But, It has started to occur to me that I use cigs to self medicate for chronic depression. 

Well, I've recently started taking antidepressants and since I started I also decided to try another quit. This time it's been much easier and I'm less tempted to relapse. I think it's because an intrinsic motivation to self medicate with cigs is being addressed by the antidepressants. 

I'm not a doctor.

I deliberately destroyed my health, burnt almost half of my money, as I continued to ignore and overlook what was obvious:  Smoking ciggarettes was the root cause of most of my personal problems.

Now, I feel just like an idiot, I feel that I played myself. I gave up so many things in favour of maintaining this miserable addiction, and got nothing in return. I just can't comprehend how I was aware of the consequences and did nothing about it, just accepting the misery.

I don't know why, but I still don't feel commited to quitting, maybe because I've tried so many times that I started to believe I'm not capable of doing it. The terrorizing thoughts of being unable to quit and dying by my own hand as a result, are revealing to me what is, in fact, the so-called ""relaxing"" and ""social"" habit, nothing more than slow suicide.

However, for as long as I can regain my health (as I am in my 20' and I believe I can undo the harm caused by almost 8 years of smoking), I will try to quit smoking these cursed sticks.

It's not exactly smoking, but same idea. I quit vaping over a year ago. Before I started vaping, I was doing Swedish snus (no cancer risk from the tons of studies I've read). I quit vaping because I felt like it was fucking up my cardiovascular health and I was scared of the unknown side effects. I switched from snus to vaping because I had some gum recession caused by it. Turns out, I was just brushing my teeth too hard.


So anyway, I quit for over a year. In my mind, ""quitting"" means not using regularly. I did about 8 months with absolutely no nicotine. I started allowing myself to have an occasional snus when drinking with friends and offered one. This went on for a good 6 months and I never felt even a slight urge to pick up my own can of snus or do it during my ""normal"" times I would normally do one before. 


Recently, I've been thinking a lot about my reasons for quitting. The main ones were gum recession and unknown concerns with the vaping. I remember how much putting a snus in after a nice meal or while going skiing or something used to bring me so much joy. Even over a year later, I still feel like something is missing during some of those moments. Idk... It's just really mentally taxing to not break down and go buy a pack of snus. If I had a firm reason like cancer or cardiovascular issues to stay quit, I would. But right now, I feel like the only reason I haven't started using it again is because all the people I told I quit would judge me and I'd stop motivating them to quit. If I'm being honest with myself, I don't really see the problem with using snus, and I'm wondering if it's worth the mental anguish I cause myself by saying in my head ""never again"". 

The only real reasons I see not to go buy a can right now are judgement from others (I shouldn't even worry about this), and getting addicted again. But is nicotine addiction even that bad? Like besides the idea of being addicted to a substance, is the addiction itself a bad thing? Everyone seems to have a vice, and this one at least seems to be relatively harmless. Since quitting, I've honestly felt myself be less productive, eating more (I haven't gained weight or anything, but my appetite is just way higher so I struggle to not eat too much), and just generally missing some part of my life. I used to pop a snus in and just get to work right away. It was like my focus pill. 


Idk, maybe this is just the addict in me talking. I'm not even sure why I made this post. I guess I just wanted to rant. I'd like to say ""someone talk me out of it,"" but I'm not sure I even care enough for that.

I've started backsliding toward smoking cigarettes every now and then. One or two cigarettes a week is still a helluva lot better than 10/day (where I was at previously), but 0 is still the correct amount.

I did notice something interesting happening that I wanted to share: Recently, my anxiety has been randomly spiking for no reason (nothing super stressful going on in my life). I'll close my eyes, take some deep breaths, and let it pass. But there's an even more obvious solution: don't smoke!

It turns out nicotine creates a special form of anxiety, which only nicotine can dispel, completing the cycle. 14 years ago, I got hooked on cigarettes during a stressful period in my life, so I never noticed this mechanism. Nicotine tricks you into thinking that a cigarette will calm you down, but it really does the opposite. Deep down, we all know this to be the case, but we let the nicotine run the show.

I've been a cigarette smoker since I was 17, and will be turning 50 this year - it's time to stop. Also, at about $17.50 (Canadian) a pack, it's an absolutely ridiculous waste of money!! Currently using a vape to help with the most intense cravings, but as far as I'm concerned, it's a Very Big Deal that I haven't had a cigarette since early New Year's morning, after smoking for more than 32 years. The plan is to wean down on the vape, and be completely free of nicotine by my 50th birthday.

Gone through some pretty intense cravings over the past few days, getting used to the way things taste and smell now (WOW), slightly cranky... but overall I'm rather shocked how well I'm doing. Previous attempts failed within a day. The brain fog is the toughest part to me, but I'm following the 4/5 D's and it helps.

Today I am super dizzy and lightheaded - anyone else getting that?

I am determined - I Will Not Smoke Today!",122

I'm honeslty really upset. As I've had smoking friends come and go over the years, I realized that I've always seemed to be left behind when everyone quit. I've been smoking for 14 years, and quiting has been one of the most challenging tasks I've ever encountered. Anyway, I've had this friend for years. She quit years ago, but very clearly always saw me as her ""smoking friend."" When we would hang out, she could bum one or two to get a fix and move on, but it was clearly expected. Like, we'd link up, and she would always ask almost immediately if I had a cig. Well, we hadn't seen eachother in about two months (life, kids, etc.) and she came over for a lunch date. I told her in advance nearly verbatim  ""I haven't smoked in 5 weeks, and I'm doing really well. There won't be smoking over here."" She congratulates me and we move forward with making the plans. She shows up and tells me ""So, I bought a pack anyway."" She has a full, brand new pack of cigarettes with her. I felt so disrespected. Her getting her fix with her ""smoking friend,"" was more important to her, than simply doing the one thing I asked her not to. Again, she is capable of having a few smokes out,, and being fine. I'm not. The longest I have quit is 4 months and I fall off the wagon every time. Usually because someone offered me one. I did have a few with her. I was so pissed, but couldn't figure out if I was fully to blame or not. I didn't speak up about the disrespect (not in my nature), but I also didn't turn the cigarettes down. I really don't think I'm fully to blame for giving in, but I still hate myself for doing so. I had to stop by the convenience store today, and it was so hard not to buy a pack. It's been a full day, and I'm struggling. I'm so angry. This time has been so different from the other times I've quit. I have had no physical (garlic juice, trust me)or emotional withdrawal. I can get through each day without thinking of smoking, or craving a cigarette and this is all new to me. Its usually so difficult! I'm honeslty very hurt by what she did, but also feel partially responsible for not speaking up. I'm also struggling with whether or not to start the clock over. I KNOW I should, but I really don't want to. That 5 weeks was amazing, does 1 bad day really have to wipe it all away? Anyway, just venting.",9

Smoking. I was 13. I'm 34 now. For 21 years a cigarette was my savior. My breaks at work. My escape from the hectic life with children. My ""yes I'm fine, I just need a smoke"". What a perfect excuse it was. I can't fathom how many times ""just going for a smoke"" saved my mental health, and possibly My physical wellbeing at some points (bar days, spent more time outside having a cigarette than I did hanging with questionable people I barely knew drinking like crazy) 
Some days I could go without one for hours, others I found myself lighting my next with the one I was about to put out. 
I tried to quit. Spent thousands on different aids. Laser therapy, hypnosis, patches, gums, lozenges, inhalers, groups... you probably know the drill. 

Then one day my son came to me (he's 11, autistic and has sensory issues using the bathroom for #2) he told me that he would work harder at using the bathroom if I promised to work harder at quitting smoking. My skeptical self giggled inside and agreed. Told him for every 24 hours he was successful, I would go the next 24 without a smoke. We've been trying to accomplish this since he was 4... so obviously I bought a pack in denial. 

So the first day happens... and I'm in panic mode. I'm not going to lie to my kid. I was NOT mentally prepared for this. I had some packs of expired no name nicorette gum and I little boy who just wanted his mom healthy. The gum....nasty....horrible.... orange flavor but it's BB date was from like 2010. Picture orange juice and brushing your teeth kind of thing. So that was canceled as an option quickly. I pushed through...but so did he!!! The next 24 came and went. There was such pride between us. He'd be like ""see what I'm doing for you mom, you're welcome"" and I'd respond with ""well now I'll live long enough that you'll be the one wiping my butt"" 

It went by so fast. Sometimes I'll catch myself missing it. A long drive, a stressful day...ugh 

Last week I received some of the best news I've heard in a while, I'm no longer killing myself slowly! 

For years I had extremely high BP(2 different meds), lesions on my liver, enlarged kidneys and spleen, non-alcoholic liver disease, sleep problems, obesity, chronic pneumonia...and one time my brain started swelling attacking me instead of the cold I had so that was fun...yes it was all connected with everything else going on. And it seemed like no matter what I did, or changed it never got better... so puff I went. 

But last week, doc calls. My blood work and scans came back from the last appointment. All clear. Literally nothing. And I'm down 26 lbs! The pneumonia and brain thing is to be determined.

It's been 127 days since I quit. I slightly changed my eating habits so I didn't gain more while quitting... but nothing insane. My skins clearer. My hairs gorgeous. I can run with the kids!!! I can hold my breath for longer than a puff ü§£ 


So the rough days... I just check my blood pressure lol",11

I was in the mindset and determined as a new year's resolution. Searched the symptoms, installed the app, wrote some motivational posters, even printed the reasons why I want to stop (10-item list). 2 weeks of research while abiding to 5 ciguarattes a day for cravings practice!

I lasted three days, and I was happy in the meanwhile. But at the third day, I started loosing it. I had zero productivity, my lungs started to hurt (some weird feeling when breathing). The thing is I'm studying my masters, plus doing research! and I'm trying to be more fit and loose the last couple of kilograms. All-in-all, it sounded as a bad time to quit, since my brain stopped functioning and I wanted to eat more. I needed food and frankly I'm not in a good financial situation where I can buy all the food I want.

Symptoms of quitting are harsh, but no one expresses that I will loose my brain in the process until I fully recover. I came to the conclusion if I want to quit, I would need a month of no brain acitivities and plenty of good comfort food (not healthy snacks!)

Is my brain trying to make up excuses of why I should get back to smoking, or does anybody have a similiar conclusions or experiences? do you guys recommend to try again now, or wait until at least I finish my studies?",4

The problem is, I have an addictive, indulgent personality. I have always done what I want to do, almost no matter what, as long as it hasn't infringed on anyone else. I live to make myself happy. I never smoked for any reason other than I liked it, genuinely. I still do, and I can't stop thinking about it. It's not the nicotine that's got me, its the heat, the smell, the action, the feeling, the front porch. I could write a poem about my love affair with cigarettes. It makes me very worried that I may not be able to quit. I am a near 30 year old man in tears because I feel like my hands are tied behind my back with this shit.

Asking for motivation and your story!,"Nicotine has been an addiction for years. I‚Äôve jumped between methods many times (cigs, vape, zyn, etc) but it‚Äôs all nicotine. I have cut back cigs pretty well but Zyn is my current addiction. 

My gums bleed constantly. My throat is literally burned. I wake up every 45 minutes or so to put a new Zyn in, and daytime always have one. I forego eating, drinking, and brushing my teeth because I‚Äôd have to take the Zyn out. I‚Äôm blowing hundreds of dollars per month‚Äîmoney I don‚Äôt have‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm on disability as my only income, and nicotine is destroying my savings. 

Yet I can‚Äôt stop. 

I significantly struggle with psychosis and bipolar. Last year I was inpatient for 4 months for an eating disorder. The nicotine lozenges they allowed me didn‚Äôt scratch the surface of my normal use, and my mental health suffered extremely from the withdrawals. I was sent to a separate inpatient psychiatric care twice during that stay because of how violent-minded I became. The withdrawals exacerbate existing mental health symptoms. 

I‚Äôm scared to quit. I have always told myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôll quit when I‚Äôm mentally stable‚Äù but the reality is that mental stability is just not my lot in life. I‚Äôm scared of how quitting will exacerbate mental illnesses that already destroy my life. I‚Äôve tried cutting back but it‚Äôs clear I need the cold-turkey method. 

Can anybody relate? How did you cope?",3

Here is my journey, how I stopped. If it worked for me maybe it'll work for you too.","I only tried quitting once. I never ''tried'' to quit. I always knew it was hard, but I'm only going through this once. I told myself when I quit, I quit. None of the quitting twice, not having that. None of the ''trying to quit'', it is ''I quit''. I told no one I was planning to quit. Only told people when i was decided and ready to make my move. That is important.

Anyways enough of that back ground story. I stopped with the help of patches and nicotine gum.

Once fed up enough I went to the pharmacy bought 8 weeks of step 1, 2 weeks of step 2, 2 weeks of step 1 and around 16 packs of 2 mg nicotine gum. Costly ? sure. Upfront it is (if you have no insurance). Way cheaper than smoking for that period of time anyways (you can do you own math's). And in the long run not even comparable.

There are 2 types of smokes you have. Addiction smokes and Routine smokes. Addiction smokes is when you haven't smoked in 1 hours and realize yup ill go for a smoke. Routine smokes are when you smoke after eating, when waking up, after sex, when drinking etc. Now patches help with the addiction smokes, not the routine smokes (those you're on your own to deal with). The gums help with the routine smokes

Nicotine addiction is like a wave. you smoke and you ride up the wave. When done you slowly descend the wave until it hits bottom, you realize shit I need more nicotine in me, lets have a smoke. Boom right back up top of the wave, rinse and repeat. a patch give you a steady supply of nicotine so none of that wave. You've grown used to that wave, and enjoy it now.  To counter act this, that is where the gums come in. when a crave comes(valley of the wave), pop a gum. It'll leave in the next few minutes. Gum makes you ride that nicotine wave you know and like. Patches flat lines the wave, so you think of it less often (every time the waves comes down to its bottom is a crave) patches prevent those as much as possible. That's why patches help addiction smokes , gums help routine smokes.

Now we understand the wave. Its all about flattening that wave. when you drop to weaker patch you counter with gum to make as less movement in the wave. try to limit you're amount of gums less nicotine the better.

When finally going to no more patch have one week of gum for those craves. after that week toss the gums out entirely. Go and buy a ton of regular nicotine free gum ! Chew gum like you've never chewed gum before!! fuck it its cheap and nicotine free

That's how i was able to survive the nicotine withdrawals. I'm writing this because if this technique can help just 1 person get out of the hell hole that is nicotine addiction, than this post and my time writing it is justified.

Everyone can do it! You can do it !

If you have any questions feel free to ask away.

I have posted yesterday about my successful quit. It's a full year now and I am really stoked about it. üí™ I was on 2 packs a day and haven't taken a single puff the entire time. So guess I consider myself safe now. 

There is this thing though with the health benefits or lack thereof in my case. I really can't say that I could point a specific one that has markedly improved. It feels like I just don't smoke anymore - which in itself is a good thing of course. But I would have really hoped I would feel pretty differently considering I have been smoking 2 packs a day for ages. I am in my mid 40s btw. I read from others than claim they feel like being reborn and stuff.

Today, I went to a bar, ordered a beer, met a few people and spent two hours having fun. While I'm glad that I finally went out to meet people, I can't help but feel stupid for wasting a chance to exchange numbers with this girl I met. 

Now the situation is this: I had strong cravings, so I tried to socialize, and avoid smoking. During this socializing thing, I wasted a good opportunity, and now feel stupid. I have strong cravings because I'm feeling stupid.

One thing I noticed were almost subconscious intentions to smoke. Without even thinking about it something in me was getting ready to grab a cigarette and light it, just as I used to all those years.

I usually have been motivated to stop,  but after a while, when going out with smokers and with alcohol, all my motivation and determinedness flies away..  since 1.5 dears i am now stuck on 1-2 cigarettes a day, always in the evenings.....i am happy to not smoke during days, i dont have cravings...   but when i am home in the evenings, i just am not strong enough to say no. 
But i know that its really stupid and just in my head! And i can do it!

I reduced the cigarettes from 20 to 2 per day.... in between stopped also completely, but ended up always beginning again.

I want to stop, but in these situations i end up saying ""ah common, who cares!!"" - and start again.

I hate that i am losing this game always and cant just say no, i dont smoke anymore! And then really not start again. I dont know why i am so weak on that point...

So here i am again... smokefree since yesterday evening and trying again.

Toward the end of the year, I started smoking hand rolled cigarettes. It‚Äôs increased since I had the last two weeks off work and have mostly been at home. (I don‚Äôt bring the rolling tobacco to work because it‚Äôs messy, and because folks at my office job would raise an eyebrow seeing me roll them.)

It‚Äôs sorta nice because these hand rolls don‚Äôt stay lit for long, and it‚Äôs near impossible to smoke a whole one in one go. So my dosage is much lower than it has been in the past. I don‚Äôt crave them first thing in the morning like I used to, and can spend entire days without smoking. But I‚Äôm concerned because it‚Äôs still smoking, and I can feel the impact of nicotine addiction creeping back into my life. 

Anybody else backslide on their quitting plans? Or, maybe you‚Äôve kept true to yours, in which case I could use a reminder of how awesome not smoking is!

Best of luck to everyone in achieving their smoke-free goals in 2022!",4

So I've made the decision to quit smoking. This is due to recent changes in my life: I've started dating a non-smoker and it's making me see how gross cigarettes are, I've also been more active playing rugby matches and doing training, I've also got myself back to the gym.

With all these changes I am starting to really see how much smoking is hindering my life and has done so for the past 6 years since starting at 14.

In 8 weeks there is a Half Marathon where a lot of my friends will be running and I've been on the fence about joining.

My main question is with the side effects I will be facing over the next couple weeks, will they still be apparent during the run (such as coughing up the past 6 years from my lungs) and do you believe it'll be achievable to run the distance taking this all into consideration.",10

Im laying here feeling a bit of anxious and decided to write a quick post.

I've been smoking for nearly 20 years ... and finally decided to quit when I woke up New Years day. I kept promising my wife for years now since my first child, who is now 13 was born... than again when my now 4 year old son was born. I have never gone a day without smoking but so far I am in almost 2 days in. I am using a electronic vape pen called the ""Stig mint"" which doesn't really taste like the Marlboro menthol that I am used to smoking but thankfully it does seem to be helping. It sucks because I do have a bit negative things going on in my life right now (petty family stuff) but I decided I'll start off the new year doing something positive which is to quit smoking and finally learn Python programming which I have been putting off for years.

So far, I have been feeling anxiety here and there but nothing that overwhelming. I was smoking a pack a day (when I first wake up before brushing my teeth, after eating breakfast, while driving, throughout the day, after dinner, after showering, etc). It could be 40 degrees outside and it wouldn't stop me. My wife  would always complain about the smell on my clothes, my health, the kids, etc. I'm praying that I can finally make this change for myself and my family.... not to mention the money we could be saving. 

I do however keep feeling like something is missing and have the urge to go outside to light one up.. I have a pack still sitting in my dresser drawer where I left it New Years eve as a reminder that I can have it nearby and not use it. Either way, it does feel good not having to go outside every hour and having that smell on me.  \_PLEASE\_ keep me in your prayers and.I hope all of you who made this a New Years resolution follow through with it and conquer this beast. <3",7

One setback is... It can all go back to 40 a day. I see why quit dates are good for this reason, but I wasn't strong enough to quit altogether.

Also the pains of smoking will live on as I continue to smoke... But I reckon the longer I live with cigarettes, the sooner it is I give up completely.

I tried patches and vapes all day long... But cravings were too overwhelming. We're all different. If you struggle to quit keep trying. Something will help once you find it.",3

I can't believe it's been a full year already! I am so proud of myself that I was able to pull thru. I have smoked 2 packs a day for decades! I quit cold turkey - no nicotine replacements. 

The first few weeks were the hardest. Then it came down to social situations and events where I used to smoke before. Every situation I conquered helped me for similar other situations to stay strong. All in all, it went surprisingly well for me. I can't say I had to face super strong cravings and was never really close to relapsing. I would be lying if I said I never was tempted. I sure was but I was proud of what I had achieved until then and didn't wanna throw it all away. I knew it was just the nicotine monster trying to lure me in and didn't wanna lose the fight against it. 

I can't say that I feel like reborn as some claim but I am very happy not to be a slave to the cigs anymore. Constantly having to worry if I got enough, the dirt, the smell, the smoke, etc. I am really glad all that crap is gone. I hoped for more health benefits though. My doc told me last week that even if I may not feel a huge change now, my body will thank me when I get older. Let's hope she's right.

The main issue I have is that going for a smoke was a break away from work (and everything else). I'd just go outside for 5 min clear my head and I was able to return again, it wasn't just for the cigarette a lot of the time. You can figure things out while you have that time or just see a different angle to problems. I'm aware that stress is a factor here but that comes with life atm.

Bit of history:  
Iv quit before and I did about 6 months with the aid of a vape but I was on a health binge and taking sport seriously at the time. I found with the vape it was easier to stop but then vaping became a problem I found myself using the vape constantly when I was outside and it gave me trouble with my gums. I then ended up back on the cigs far worse than before id stopped. Sport was a great driver to stopping as I could see the results. I've injured my ankle since then and it tears very easily ever since. 

Has anyone else gone through this and found a way around it?  
I'm not going to use a vape but I am considering gum or patches this time so any tips there would also be nice.   
I do think going out in the fresh air would still be good but I think I need something to do while I'm out there and because its in public I don't really want to be doing breathing exercises.  


TLDR: I Want to stop but need something else to replace a smoke break while still getting outside for 5 min.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance :)",7

9 year smoker (about 34 cigs a day) here. I'm usually not big on new years resolutions, maybe that's why I'm doing this a day late. But about an hour ago I smoked my last cigarette. I'm writing this as the first urges for the next one come up in me, but jokes on the urge, I simply don't have any more cigarette and I sure as hell won't go out now just to get another pack. That's pretty much my game plan for this; combine my laziness with willpower against the addiction. I'm too lazy to go out just for cigarettes, and when I'm out and about the willpower part comes into play. I figure if I don't buy any there's simply no alternative to not smoking. Well, let's see how that goes. Wish me luck!",40

Because smoking might provide a transition, but I'm not learning to tell my body and brain I am safe.

Average of a pack per day. (I quit cigarettes for 1 year in 2002 but on weekends and evenings I still puffed some Joints with tobacco in it). Took some efforts to quit totally that went on for 3-4 weeks.
Of course I never planned to smoke almost 30 years. But since we all know how it affects health and we need our ‚Äûif - then‚Äú excuse to manipulate our minds to a rest, I always promised myself at least when i begin to sense health deterioration or symptoms like coughing, short breath etc., I will stop. Well 2-3 months ago I realised that when I talk, I unexpectedly get out of air and have to take a breath to continue. Also when I went to bed and exhaled, I heard my lung ‚Äûcry‚Äú for help (like whistling noises from mucus I think?)
So I just stopped cold turkey 3 weeks ago. I already feel a bit better, whistling noise was gone next day, and I can breath a bit better.
Of course I have downloaded all those fancy stop-smoking apps which monitor the improvement of body functionality. But after feeling a bit deliberate in the first week, it seems that it stays on the same level somehow. For Example when all that carbon-monoxide blocked the oxygen distribution before, it should be a lot easier to climb a few stairs for example. But I had days where i felt a lot weaker than in my smoking days. Don‚Äôt get me wrong- I am aware how I abused my body for decades and I can be glad that It still carries me to the fifth floor (or anywhere) at all. But I just would like to get some idea how this developed in other cases of heavy smokers. Just to look forward to it and manifest those good reasons to stop.",7

Edit: I actually have some additional questions I'd love to pose of anyone willing to answer! Specific to folks who use SmokeFree:

* What do you find most motivating about the SmokeFree app?
* What do you find most frustrating, if anything, about the SmokeFree app?
* How old are you, and for how many years did you smoke?
* How long ago did you quit smoking and how long did you use NRTs if you did (or where are you in your NRT journey if you're still using them)?
* If SmokeFree has helped you more than other methods of support, why was that the case?

First, this subreddit has had huge positive influence on me. All the stories, the advice and the encouragement are exactly what i needed in the last couple of months.

The best suggestion I received from the subreddit was reading"" The Easy Way To Stop Smoking"" by Allen Carr and also using an app like "" quit tracker"" or the "" smokefree"" to record my progress was also a good suggestion.

I always suffered from anxiety, insomnia and thought that cigarettes were a vital part of my day. I believed that they relaxed me and relieved my anxiety. For five years, I was chain-smoking daily. Rolling my own cigarettes and sometimes rolling a new cigarette before finishing the one I am already smoking.

I have tried quitting and failed several times, then I tried convincing myself that smoking is a pleasure that only smokers could understand and that it's a choice but deep down I knew that i was a slave to that dirty habit. So how did quit ?

1-I decided to quit smoking and I really meant it.

2- Threw away every lighter, cigarette.. And everything related to smoking.

3-Made a 30-days daily routine challenge:

\-Wake up at 6 am

\- listen to a chapter from the Allen Carr's book (this helped me remind myself of why I quit smoking and kept me excited and proud of my journey) while doing a 15 minutes workout with my resistance bands

\-take a warm shower afterwards

\-Meditate using the Headspace Program

Now It's 7.30 am, and I am ready for the day. I am feeling fresh, happy , proud and relaxed.

&#x200B;

I have always wondered why I couldn't quit smoking, but once I gave myself the right conditions and the right mental state, I stopped sabotaging myself and finally quit smoking.

I am not saying that this is the only way to quit smoking, but I wanted to share my story with you guys. You helped by making me feel not alone in my journey, and for that I am grateful.

Day 32 - I will not smoke with all of you today! 

Happy new year! Like each new year, it offers a chance to refresh our outlook, set new goals and make resolutions. Is one of your resolutions to quit, or stay smoke-free and vape-free? Here are some tips to make 2022 a smoke-free and vape-free year!

*Quit. A lot.*
It can take a lot of tries to stay quit for good ‚Äî so try, try, and try again!

*Celebrate your failures.*
Each time you try to quit, you learn more about what works for you and what pitfalls to avoid. So, celebrate learning something new for the next time you try to quit, and¬†live chat with a Quit Coach¬†to create a personalized quit plan.

*Join our community.*
You aren‚Äôt the first person to quit smoking or vaping, and you won‚Äôt be the last, but maybe your friends and family don‚Äôt really get it.¬†Smokers‚Äô Helpline¬†has an anonymous community where you can talk to other people quitting, get support and ask all of the questions that might be on your mind.

*Make excuses.*
Somebody is going to ask you out for a smoke break, or you‚Äôre going to get that after-lunch vape craving. What are you going to do? Start making excuses now so that you have one ready when you need it. And for those stressful situations you can‚Äôt excuse yourself from, you can text iQuit to 123456 to make sure you have on-the-go support and are able to text the word CHAT to text one-on-one with a Quit Coach to help you get through those situations.

*Overshare.*
Tell everybody you‚Äôre quitting. Post it on Facebook, tell that guy you buy your coffee from, tell everybody. Public pledges help keep you accountable and allow your friends to support you when you need it.

*Take up drinking water.*
Drinking more water, especially early on, will help during cravings and will speed up the removal of nicotine and other stuff from your system. And yeah, even if quitting is driving you to drink, try to lay off the booze¬†‚Äî¬†it‚Äôs a pretty common reason people fall off the quit-wagon.

*Take a walk break.*
Bundle up, get your boots on, and head outside. Exercise, like walking or running, can help you stay smoke-free and reduce common side effects (like weight gain).

*Use nicotine‚Ä¶*
‚Ä¶ from Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products. They work by bringing down your daily dose of nicotine bit by bit without the other effects of tobacco. It‚Äôs a method that can more than double your chances of long-term success, and works with the other tips in this list, too. You can talk to your doctor or pharmacist or talk to a Quit Coach through our¬†website live chat¬†for more information.

* If you are a resident of Ontario, you can register for STOP on the Net¬†‚Äî¬†a free online smoking cessation program that offers eligible participants a kit containing 8 weeks' worth of nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine patches & choice of nicotine gum/lozenges), mailed directly to you!

It's been about 4 days I don't want to keep count or time it. I want to be done and that is what I'm doing. 

So this morning I wrote for awhile about all the things I'm my head about being sad and etc etc. I also had written about triggers and what to do.

When sitting with my husband who is a smoker I was sad about something we were talking about, he was smoking. I almost held my hand out for it. Then I thought 'break state break state'- which means I have to either do deep breaths or leave location for a walk or do jumping jacks. I took a breath and thought of looking up a recipe for cake and left the location. Here I am. 

It's not even nicotine withdrawal this was a habitual call. Fuck you to smoking. My cough is still there how can my brain even tell me one drag won't harm, it's been the worst cough I've had. It's sad that I can deceive myself so well and have fallen for it so many times over the years.",27

2022-01-01 08:22:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/rtjc45/six_years/,Six years!,"I stopped smoking on New Years Eve 2015 and realised that I have been free of the cigs for six years. I had smoked for around 15 years and went cold turkey with the incentive of helping my asthma to get better.

I don‚Äôt even think about smoking now, and have actually become one of those dreadful people who slightly wince at the thought. For anyone else giving up as we go into the new year, you can do it! It really does get easier and there is another side, all you need to do it really want it.

Happy new year!",56

How crazy is that? I stopped smoking cigarettes a year ago and switched to vaping 2 months later and since May I‚Äôve been going 6 days per week to the gym. I used Champix and I very rarely if ever get cravings or think about smoking/vaping.

But holy hell, walking from reception downstairs to the gym makes me WANT that vape so bad. I really can‚Äôt explain it either I vaped everywhere all the time as it was seen as socially acceptable. But I still haven‚Äôt and won‚Äôt ever take another single puff.",9

I‚Äôve (23m) been smoking since 18, a pack a day. Im around it all the time at work and with company. 
I also just found out I‚Äôll be a father soon which is wonderful news. My girlfriend dropped vaping cold turkey when she found out. 

I want and need to quit for myself, my child, and for her, I just NEED help. I need the best advice for triggers, urges, things that have helped you guys that I can atleast attempt. Words of encouragement are also appreciated. Secondary reasoning from another‚Äôs perspective is also nice. 

Last words, proud of all of you for keeping these death sticks out of your mouth whether a day, 10, or 1,000. Keep going strong, I‚Äôll meet you on this journey soon.",6
