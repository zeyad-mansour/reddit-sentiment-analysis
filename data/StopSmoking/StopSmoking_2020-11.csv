Small strategies will allow you to see immediate results, like putting money on the side, that will remind you why you stopped smoking every single day.

And you can find strategies to keep you busy. As an example, I‚Äôve created a podcast and it ended up being really helpful. One week or so after I decided to quit, we got into a lockdown, I stopped working and I really had to keep myself busy. If when you quit smoking, you are not in the middle of one, probably the time that you really need to keep yourself busy is less. However, don‚Äôt neglect it. Find out things that will keep your mind or your body active and that will give you some pleasure. To replace the one you were used to with cigarettes.

I'm 19 and a student of architecture college. I already smoking for about 2 years and have try few times to stop smoking

The problem is every time i try to quit i can't think clearly, it's like my brain force me to think fast so i can't really find the answer of my own mind. Feels like something chasing to think so i never able think to the end or solution. My adrenaline is actually normal when feel so but it's really ruined my brain, even sometimes when i think for a thing, another thing just comes up and forcing me to think about that. This effect just happen when I'm not smoking for few hours and have somethings to think about (homework, etc).

And i actually have a habit to walk around when think from highschool but when the condition above is happen my habbit to walk while thinking is getting really often, even i ever walking about half hour and rest for few seconds and walking again and repeat all night. And when i wake up after sleeping i just feel the effect like my legs are really tired. So its like the condition force me to think and i force my self to walk to think.

Back to the condition on first paragraph, after that happen and i smoking, i fell more calm and not feel my brain get forced to think anymore. I don't know if the chemical in tabbaco cause this or it's just a phycological effect, but i really want to quit so bad but also not able to withstand the effect.

That's all, i really hope if anyone can give me advice... Really appreciate that

The anxieties reducing is great; both for the quitting process itself (anxiety makes me want to smoke), and just for life (anxiety is not a fun state to be in... obviously haha).

Having a better sense of smell and taste is also nice. I also want to start cooking better meals so that is great :)

Also good that the body's functional abilities are improving after 72 hours. That's Monday morning  for me, that's just around the corner! :) I want to do triathlons again, rock climbing and many other (extreme) sports, great to know that this dream will become reality soon :)

Why is it that you want to stop smoking so bad?

Is it because of your health? Do you feel any pain, you cough a lot, what? For me, this was one of the reasons. An intense pain in my throat was something that started to bother me to a level that I really wanted to get rid of it so why not put a stop on my smoking consumption. I did it, of course, and it worked. Took it‚Äôs time but now, I don't have that burning feeling I had before and that‚Äôs great.

It can be as well, because of the money that you are spending. Cigarettes are expensive. I live in the UK and in here, it is no exception. I‚Äôm sure some countries might have a lighter tax system for this kind of products but it is always money that you are giving away for something that you, first don‚Äôt need and second, can do serious damage to your health.

Since I stopped smoking, I have saved more than 200 pounds that I made my case to really put it to the side. I might spend it some day, but for the moment it‚Äôs a good reminder on why I‚Äôm doing this and it‚Äôs always good to save money, right?

If in the end, I was spending it on cigarettes and wasn‚Äôt starving, it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem to put it aside now, anyway.

I hope this is helpful,

Currently a college student, I smoked cigarettes for almost all of last year. I don‚Äôt smoke cigarettes regularly, but I‚Äôve become seriously addicted to mixing weed and tobacco, usually through bong rips. There aren‚Äôt a lot of alternatives that give me that same head rush/high transition that spliffs/moles give me and it‚Äôs terrible because I know how bad it is to mix them for your lungs.

For almost a year now, I‚Äôve probably smoked a fully topped bowl of 50/50 weed + tobacco, in one breath every time, every 4-5 hours. It didn‚Äôt use to affect my work or schoolwork, but now with quarantine and less ways to get out of the house, I‚Äôve become really dependent on it to get me active during the day, despite the tiredness and frequent spitting throughout the day.

I didn‚Äôt even touch cigarettes til about 2 years ago even though all of my friends did, and I‚Äôve been smoking weed for longer than that, but it just feels embarrassing to myself how every time I wake up with a plan, my first instinct is still to pack myself another bowl, always checking my clock around the 4-5 hour mark when I know the rush will still hit hard enough without making me puke. And after that my drive is gone, and now I‚Äôm stuck barely getting anything done while my body is kicking itself.

I'll give some background to what I've been doing, I've switched over to vaping for now. So a few months back me and my partner moved in to a new house and we decided that there would be no smoking inside. Landlord is an old family friend and they spent a lot of money on redoing the entire house and offered it to us for way less than it should be, they wouldn't stop us smoking inside but they didn't really like the idea. Given they offered us a great house for cheap with free reign to do what we want with it we felt not smoking inside was fine. Something that was reinforced when we ended up replacing a lot of furniture after we realised just how yellow it all was. My Dad has also had health problems this month that means he has to stop along with my partners parents too so we've decided it's time to really work on being non-smokers for ourselves too.

To help with that we got a couple of vape devices to use inside and so I've spent the past few months slowly replacing smoking habits with vaping. I was using 18mg salts and smoking while outside. Since Monday I've switched entirely to using 12mg juices and haven't had a single cigarette. My plan is to reduce the strength down over time until I eventually hit 0, after that it'll be breaking the vape habit. I've tried pretty much all other nicotine therapies and vaping is the one I've found that actually works in terms of the nicotine cravings. 

I've also found doing something I saw on a Derren Brown special has really helped, were you don't say things like quit, stop, or give up as they're negative actions and instead saying it as a positive action like ""I am becoming a Non-Smoker."" Simply saying that to myself gives a sort of confidence boost, which I figured would be stupid and wouldn't work with me but it actually is helping.

The past few days were really easy but the habit of having a cigarette has been kicking my ass today and I've only been up a few hours. I know it's not the nicotine aspect as I'm practically drinking the juices at the moment (Which is somewhat annoying as it will cost more at this rate) but it's not covering the habit like it has been doing (even when I was split between this and smoking it did a better job than it currently is).

It's quite frustrating honestly because I know there's no need to go have one nicotine wise and yet I'm still fighting an urge to go and do something I know I don't need or want.

I just wanted to write up how I'm feeling and to see if anyone else had this kind of experience, where it suddenly kicked in a few days after, I figured I'd be like this the first day. Honestly it's eased up a bit while I've been writing this actually, I guess just writing out how you're feeling does help too.

This a longer post than I originally intended and it feels a little silly to be doing it really given I've only been off cigarettes for a few days and I've really on swapped to a different habit for now. I imagine theres people on here months in that are probably feeling it much harder at times.

Quit smoking, quit smoking! And then what! Brain doesn't understand this! It is a working machine that never quits and stops!  


Instead design Life of Non Smokers!  What you want your life to look like after cigarettes and nicotine addiction!   


It works like this: Imagine you have an idea to go on a road trip to get on a sea coast for two week vacation you know the destination you have an idea what it is going to look like sound like, and feel like  even if there is no proof that is going to be that way, but the image is so good that you are willing to risk a flat tire and any risks that follows. 

Same way is with The Life Of Non-Smokers, when you know what you want to achieve al that small obstacles look minor.

I found this sub massively helpful at the beginning of my quit and would read it several times a day for inspiring stories, other people‚Äôs advice and also to offer others words of support and encouragement as it helped me concentrate on my own efforts to stop smoking.  As a few weeks passed (thankfully smoke free!) I visited the sub less and less, which I thought was because I was dealing with it better on my own and having less cravings.  However looking back I believe now that reading the subs about smoking so frequently may actually have been triggering my cravings.  When cravings hit I have found that it is far more beneficial to do something completely separate from smoking to distract your thoughts from smoking.  As inspirational and supportive as this sub is, it‚Äôs still focus on smoking and mentally and emotionally it can enhance your craving to smoke, even when it‚Äôs being spoken about negatively.
Don‚Äôt get my wrong, this is still an amazing tool to help you along the way, and I certainly still check in from time to time for inspiration, but my advice is to use it moderately and only in times of need.

A Child In War

When I was 6 years old, civil war broke out in Bosnia. Overnight, my family and I became refugees. We had to leave home to seek safety from death and destruction. Eventually, our town became just safe enough to live in. Yet, every day, we went to school and lived under constant threat of bomb shells.

Children are very resilient. We often heard the whistle of bombs overhead. But we continued with our lives the best we knew how. We could not know the long-term effects of that experience.

College

I eventually went to University to study Economics. It was challenging. I enjoyed it. But I couldn‚Äôt understand why I was in a low, but increasing state of anxiety.

It was then, about age 19, I started smoking cigarettes. It was the cool. Everyone smoked. I fit in! And as students, we always had no money. For a few dollars, we could share a pack of cigarettes and drink coffee all day. The calming effect of less oxygen to my brain helped with my slowly increasing anxiety levels too.

I was smoking a little more. Yet, smoking wasn‚Äôt helping enough with the anxiety. I was moving into a depressive phase.

Adulthood

I finished University. It was time to face real life. I secured a Government Tax Officer position. I was a degreed Economist. But those jobs were scarce. I had a stable, Government job. But there was no professional growth. It was unfulfilling.

Worse, common in former Communist countries are bosses who are bosses due to political support; NOT competence. My boss was THE example of that. I constantly had more than my share of abuse from him.

My job was unfulfilling with an abusive boss. My anxiety levels were going up fast. I was more depressed than ever. My drinking and smoking greatly increased.

Personal Crisis

Life sends you what it sends you. You must find ways to deal with it. A few years later, I suffered a great family loss. Shortly after, there was a great National Disaster that strongly effected the entire population.

I did not deal well with these matters. My depression deepened. I increased my self-destructive behaviors of drinking and smoking. I hit my all-time low. But I thought to myself, ‚ÄúI have lived though a war. I want to live through this!‚Äù

Re-Awakening

I got medical guidance. I was diagnosed with clinical depression. I began to deal with my childhood war experiences that had so greatly impacted me as an adult. I learned of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP). I found the tools that would forever change my life for the better.

Smashing the Grip of Nicotine and Breaking the Chains of Addiction

Still battling clinical depression, I raised self-medicating with cigarettes to 2 packs a day. That‚Äôs one EVERY 24 minutes. I did NOT realize their influence on me!!

One week, I had money for 2 days of cigarettes AND food, but wasn‚Äôt getting paid for 5 days. I COULDN‚ÄôT see I had money for 5 days of food if I just DID NOT smoke for 3 days. I thought about NOT eating for 3 days SO I COULD SMOKE!! I was an ADDICT, a SLAVE to nicotine!! It was THAT MOMENT I decided to SMASH the grip of nicotine and BREAK the chains of addiction!! I was in charge, NOT cigarettes!!

A Happy Ending

It was difficult at first. With the CBT and NLP therapies, I have SMASHED the grip of nicotine and have BROKEN the chains of my addiction!!

I am in charge of my thoughts, my actions and my life. There is no little voice in my head that is screaming at me to smoke a cigarette every 24 minutes.

I live the life of a Li.O.N.S. (Life of a Non-Smoker), and so can you. We can make the journey together. You CAN do it!! I would be pleased to be your guide!!

 I though that I want a good life for me, to feel good and healthy, to be happy. But that was not the case as I learned. As it turned out, I have exactly the thing that I want most in the world. To not feel unpleasant emotions. 

After something painful happened, I told my self, I will make everything possible to not feel like this again. And I got exactly that. Of course I didn't realize I had that, because it didn't came as I expected it, it came in the form of not feeling anything at all, and avoiding every situation that has the slightest possibility to trigger unpleasant feelings , which lead to loneliness and depression and a lot of mental problems.

I didn't became immune to negative emotions, I became like a rat, hiding behind a cigarette or junk food or the internet, lying in bad doing nothing. After all this is exactly what I wished for.

Not to mention it was already 2 o'clock, because the moment I woke up I cleaned the house. So I thought ""look man, you haven't smoked for 17 hours and I don't see you care that much. Why don't you push it to see how far it can go?""

So here I am, 8 days after that. I felt (and feel) fine most of the time. The only cravings I get are when I'm on my PS4 with my buddy on the mic, because I have associated that activity with chill cigarettes. I was mostly smoking because it felt nice in my head, not on my body.

She‚Ä≤s so amazing and I already have told her I would do anything for her. I am an avid vaper, I still use my JUUL and never had any plans on quitting. My girlfriend, however, is not okay with this in the slightest. Of course, it is all simply due to the fact that she cares and is worried about me, and I do appreciate that, but I am terrified of quitting (as I‚Ä≤m sure many other people are as well). I understand nicotine is a pretty pointless drug to get addicted to, but I must admit that it synergizes really well with lots of other things. So, I‚Ä≤ve tried to negotiate with her about this or try to meet in the middle, but nothing has budged her and I truly believe that nothing will. What it basically has come down to is, it‚Ä≤s either her, or the JUUL.

I‚Ä≤m not only taking the initiative to quit vaping for her, but also for myself. I honestly feel like not having to rely on nicotine would be very relieving. She can tell me she wants me to quit as much as she wants, but the only way I can do so is by getting in the right mindset myself. I need to truly grasp the concept of quitting on my own in order to be able to do so.

So if anybody can help me out by giving me some solid reasons to quit (besides the fact that it‚Ä≤s harmful and/or could kill me), I would really appreciate it.

I lasted a week. 

Some Vocab terms I‚Äôll be using from Alan Carr‚Äôs Easyway:
1) ‚Äúnicotine monster‚Äù - the physical addiction to nicotine 
2) ‚Äúnon-smoker‚Äù - someone who is joyful about quitting, pities smokers, never looks back! 
3) ‚Äúex-smoker‚Äù - someone who quit but feels deprived, jealous of other smokers, often tempted 

So, I lasted a week, and although I felt like a non-smoker for a few days, the feelings of being an ex-smoker started crawling in... I started looking at other smokers and wanting it... 

I did okay, but then I had a big test and test anxiety. In addition, my previous smoke spots are next to my university, so the temptation to give in to old habits began to rear its head. I live in a country that completely accepts smoking, so there‚Äôs no social shame either... and I gave in. I don‚Äôt know how much of my ‚Äúhabit‚Äù temptations were the nicotine monster vs. the enjoyment of a smoke break.

I have to admit, I‚Äôm not a non-smoker. I thought I was, but I‚Äôm still an ex-smoker. I bought a pack and, keeping it in my bag, I feel ‚Äúcomforted‚Äù in a way even if I don‚Äôt smoke it. 

I want to be a non-smoker SO BADLY. But for now, I‚Äôm setting my quit date to my life change of moving apartments in a few months. I think it‚Äôll be drastic enough to align with the life change of quitting smoking. Hopefully. I just hate the feeling of weakness...

I'm here because I love my friends. 

I'm desperate for your advises on the best consumables, remedies, practices, and anything else you've got that helped you or someone you know to stop smoking cigarettes. I love my friends dearly and I'm simply heart broken to watch them happily smoke their lives away. The money spent and the minutes of their lives being puffed away. I simply can't stand it, I don't have a family and my friends are my true support system. Outliving them is a real, and hysterical fear of mine. Especially now that we're all entering the second stages of our lives and becoming mature adults. I've given them all the science, and financial advices I can imagine but the addiction and habit always ends up overtaking any long term goals they have. 

One of my friends is a single dad with a 6 year old girl, he's active and healthy excluding the cigs. 

One is a dad of soon to be 2, and he's always strapped for cash because he smokes nearly 2 packs a day. 

One is living with his girlfriend who also smokes.. so he will be the most difficult one to get to kick the cigs since someone else will likely be influencing his habits.  

I have to help these people even if I have to temporarily hurt our friendship to get them off their stupid money/time/heath wasting habits. 

I always get my friends a christmas gift and I'm going to be slipping in something along the lines of quitting with the gift this year. I've got some ideas to go along with these quitting supplements, my big reveal is I'm going to barter with them that if they can ALL stop smoking and after 365 days comes around I will take them on an all expenses paid vacation.

I quit cigs a little over 2 weeks ago but feel like since then my intake of marijuana has definitely increased. I guess this is to be expected, with me looking for something to replace that feeling of constantly smoking on something. I've always said that I would have a much harder time quitting weed than nicotine, since I dont actually have any moral objections to smoking it and know it isnt causing harm to me outside of my wallet. But since my wallets been looking a little bleak lately I've definitely been considering cutting back on the Mary Jane too. Part of me feels like this would be easier than quitting cigs because 1. Its harder to get, 2. It's not physically addictive, and 3. I can still smoke it on occasion if I want to. The cons worry me too though, like how I might have a harder time quitting since I actually get a buzz from weed opposed to cigs, and I'll have a harder time convincing myself to stop since I know it isnt actually harming me. I guess I'm just looking for advice, stoners who have also quit cigs, did you find yourself smoking more tree when you quit? If I smoking tree will my want for cigs return? How did you handle it? Did you quit both at the same time? Have a method for cutting back? I read Allen Carrs Easyway to stop smoking, can any of his knowledge be applied here?

Once I convinced myself that the discomfort of withdrawals would be worth the money I'd save and finally end the constant desire to have a cigarette in my mouth, it was pretty easy. I just had to convince myself that I wanted it bad enough, and that I was tired of being dependent on something that was ultimately bad for my health (both physical and mental). 

I decided to put myself first and imagine how much better I would feel in a year. It doesn't feel as simple as this, but if you don't put a cigarette to your mouth and light it, and do that again and again until the desire goes away, you'll have beat it! I had some cravings today but didn't even entertain the idea of smoking a cig, or else I'd risk getting pulled in by the thought and bumming one or buying a pack. Distractions are nice too. not wanting my family to know i'm still smoking and having to go home for a week for thanksgiving helped too.

It really was easier than I imagined and instead of smoking with my spare time I've been reading a book! mentally i feel much sharper and more optimistic. I challenge myself more and feel generally better about myself, which might be because it took an increase in self esteem for me to think hurting my body and lungs wasn't worth it anymore.

22 y/o male. Heavy vaper... 1 pod (nicotine = 1 pack of cigarettes) a day  for 3 years. Then switched to 4mg Zins (I guess its technically snus) 20 pouches a day for 6 months.

Finally decided to quit about a week ago. Quit because I was having some circulatory problems (numbness / tingling in hands / feet) waking up in the morning that was correlated with how high my nicotine intake was the prior day. Plan was to go cold turkey, but in reality in ended up being just cutting down nicotine intake by about 80%.  I've been experiencing brain fog (can't focus at all, sometimes slight confusion, random words popping into my head, feeling a little tongue twisted) for pretty much the whole week where I've cut back.

&#x200B;

A few questions:

1. Best ways to help cope with this? I work a demanding job with numbers where I need to be on my game mentally.
2. How long until this goes away? Will this continue indefinitely if I only cut back my nicotine consumption, rather than quitting completely?
3. Any other comments / advice welcome. Trying to learn as much as I can.

Also side note: The circulatory problems I was feeling in the morning have already drastically improved since the cut down. Good motivation to keep pushing forward and try to quit completely.

These. Are. Not. Healthy. For. You.

Most dry herb vaporizers will use glass or ceramic pathways for the vapor to travel. The heat, air flow, and cleaning with ISO will eventually cause erosion that can travel with the air flow of the vapor, causing microscopic contaminations. Steel paths are generally used with butane torches to prevent conduction from electrical heating sources. Steel path vapes are even more dangerous since they have to be torched with a butane lighter, coating the chamber with butane contamination and will eventually start to singe the metal and cause you to inhale those as well.

Dry herb vapers will claim to have had no issues. These people are usually 2-3 year smokers (not enough time for chronic issues to show yet) or shills looking to make a quick buck out of you or moderators trying to keep their ""jobs"".

I've gained more weight than that before and never noticed a change to the face. 

It took me a few weeks to figure out exactly what I was noticing. Why I'm noticing a subtle but negative change that I had never seen before. Now I know and have confirmed it by reading stories from other people. Right above my jaw, in line with my ears, there is now a noticeable build up of hard muscle from constantly, and I mean constantly, working a piece of nicotine gum. I mean constantly. And I don't ""park"" it very often, just subconsciously and habitually chewing it with front teeth, side teeth back teeth... constantly working my jaw. Those exact muscles have built themselves up at least a millimeter or two, enough to notice. Now there's another reason to quit the gum too. A reason I hadn't expected.

I‚Äôve vaped more or less daily for the last 4 years. Was never really anything but a social/drunk smoker. Started out with mods, then briefly quit before starting up again with juul. These days I‚Äôve primarily used Njoy - loved the blueberry flavor until it was banned and now I‚Äôve been using the menthol for months and I don‚Äôt even really like it. I just have needed the nic and at 5% it does the trick.

I‚Äôve been able to sorta quit on a few occasions - I didn‚Äôt vape for about 3 weeks when I traveled abroad with my family, and I also quit for a few weeks last Christmas, but I ultimately went back every time. This time I really think I‚Äôm in a place mentally where I WANT to give it up for good. I‚Äôve lost weight and gotten much healthier in general this year, so now it‚Äôs time to kick this shitty habit to the curb.

I‚Äôm staying with the family this week for Thanksgiving and they def frown on vaping and smoking, so I figured this would be a good time. Had my last hit of my vape around noon, threw it in the trash (a public trash can for extra insurance lol) and drove to the parents place.

Day 1 - So I‚Äôm approximately 12 hours into day 1 here. It hasn‚Äôt been too bad. I‚Äôve felt a little on edge and had cravings especially after eating and after my parents went to bed; currently just bored watching tv which would usually be chain vaping time but my parents live in a pretty rural area and I couldn‚Äôt get anything without driving 30+ minutes anyway, so staying strong is pretty easy. Will update more later. I feel like I need to make it a full month to really feel like I‚Äôm done.

Since I was young I've been slim built and that's always something I wanted to change. I try to eat as much as I can but smoking would suppress my appetite completely and my meals would as a result be a fair amount smaller. This coupled with whatever else lies in the cigarette would make me feel lethargic, lazy and unmotivated to do anything sometimes.

I see people here sharing their tips and tricks and stories, so I thought I'd share mine in the hopes that at least one more person gets motivated enough to make the decision to quit :)
 I am 3 months smoke free and doing so much better than I ever anticipated. I quit on a whim one day and went completely cold turkey. Since I used to smoke quite a lot, the withdrawal symptoms were pretty bad. 

Quitting has been a process for me, i had tried 2 times before, none succeding for more than a couple of days, and I had also switched to vaping for a while a few years back. I am saying this because I feel that those details allowed me to learn and be aware that, when i finally quit, some of my experiences were due to physical withdrawal, and some due to psychological.

Of course it was the whole package, plenty of cravings, irritability, anger, constipation (tmi?).
But what I had always been dreading, and what had always been the reason i would succumb and start smoking again, was the mind fog.

That shit was intense, I felt like I had drank 6 glasses of wine but, of course, had no issues with balance nor the happy feeling of being a little intoxicated.

That familiar to me side effect was always a deal breaker, especially because i am a medical student and never go too long without having to study. I would always think ""What chance do I have? If I am to do this and not fail again I should do it sometime when I can be relaxed for a few weeks! How will that happen if I am failing to study all the time?""

But 3 months ago, when one morning I was stinking so much and my mouth felt as if I'd drank soap the night before, I said "" f**k it. Next exam is in 3 weeks from now. If I fail, it will be ok, and if I pass I will be so proud for making it while quitting smoking at the same time"", and so I did.

What not many people underline about that side effect is that, like every mild acute illness, it dominates you at first and makes you forget how life was without it. Personally, just 36 hours in, i had forgotten what a clear mind even was.

But just like a regural flu, the mind fog eventually gets lifted, not all at once, but just a little everyday. Slowly enough, that you only notice that you are getting better when you think about how you were yesterday; but fast enough that, when your healing becomes so obvious that not even your addicted ass can deny it, it gets you a little excited.

5 to 6 days later, i woke up and was feeling a bit better, but not much. I told my colleagues and friends of what i was experiencing and we all laughed a few times about how absent minded I was, me laughing most of all. that helped a lot

One more day, and then another, and then I'd feel as if 5 cups of coffee could compensate for that fog. A couple of days later, i felt that 4 cups could suffice :P until one day, not too long after quitting, I realised the fog was lifted and, with it, so did the physical addiction and most of the symptoms.

Every other damage that smoking has caused you, will eventually get healed following a similar pattern. Right now I am coming to realise that my lungs are getting tougher and I no longer feel sporadically out of breath, even though I'm young and had never realosed I was getting dyspnoea. 
I am also learning that my smoking was a way out of a plethora of bad emotions; instead of dealing with justified anger, I used to light a cigarette; instead of feeling the sadness and sharing it with my loved ones so id get some compassion, I'd light a cigarette.
 Just like I saw someone else state somewhere around here, smoking is an emotional crutch that you have to learn to walk without after quitting, and doing so feels amazing.

 Personally i feel that that ""emotional crutch"" has so much to do with the psychological aspect of addiction, and leaving one behind means leaving the other one too. 


But i am getting sidetracked üòÖ 
What I want to say is
if you are no longer addicted physically
the process of getting better gets so much more interesting.

I honestly, truly, hope that in a year, two or ten from now i can still come to you people and say ""I havent smoked a single puff!"".

If you smoke, I urge you to try üíö 
One smokefree day at a time is enough. 

I wish everyone luck and hope you wish me too :)

I‚Äôm a 23M who picked up smoking cigarettes roughly a year ago, to me it was a way to ease stress from my job. Luckily I quit for about 4 months now but it was so difficult. My mother smokes cigarettes and has tried to quit multiple times and my father had a heart attack a year ago, he smoked cigarettes but quit due to basically being forced because of the heart attack.

It has become a passion and absolute goal of mine to find a way to help people quit smoking. It sucks, and being a young guy seeing the people they feel entrapped by cigarettes is tough to see. 

I finally found a way/idea/program that may aid people in quitting smoking without taking drugs like Chantix, or Nicolette which has roughly 13% success rate. If you don‚Äôt mind answering the questions on the poll, it‚Äôll help a great deal to see if my idea even has viability, but to me, it makes incredible sense.

I'm about two weeks into quitting and my Vape has been a great tool for helping with day time cravings. I'm diluting 6mg liquid with 0mg to give myself like 3 or 4mg

From experience, how long do withdrawal symptoms last with a vape?
Compared to going cold turkey?

I'm currently fighting migraines, sweats, insomnia and depression.
Any long time smokers got some tips?
Especially with the Sweats, no deodorant is strong enough!

I Smoked cigarettes and also vaped every single day. I tried weaning myself off of it, but it generally lead to relapsing every time. Now I will say everyone is different and i am not a doctor. I quit cold turkey and experienced the awful withdraw symptoms like everyone else. 

* buy gum to help with cravings and oral fixation (not nicotine gum, just gum) 
* get a notebook to write in every day. reflect on your habit and misery you are going through by quitting. Understand that you enabled your self to be this way, acceptance is key.
* Be aware of what your mind immediately jumps after too after quitting, like alcohol or an increased amount of caffeine. You quit to quit not to replace your habit with another vice.
* distract yourself with movies or video games, easy stimulation is key at first. you don't want to mentally break your self into another relapse. 
* Build your self a schedule of task everyday and get them done, helps train your brain in a different way to release dopamine.
* Understand that once you quit that your a not smoker trying to quit, you are a NON-SMOKER. i know this sounds silly but reiterate this to yourself everyday because it is what you are going to become.
* let people you know that actually care about you that you are quitting. nothing is worse than trying to quit and to be be judged for it.

Understand that is going to be rough for at least a while, but picture 10 year from now you thanking you from the suffering you are going through. You will will learn a lot about yourself through the process of quitting. I ended up quitting alcohol and caffeine as well. My sleep, mood, and energy has improved more than i ever thought it could.

Good luck to all of you!

Bars being closed has meant quitting smoking cigs was infinitely easier. I can and would smoke at home, I have an outdoor patio space to do so, but since my quit date in late April, I have not given in.

I'm 23 days off smoking.

The first two weeks were like an easy walk: yeah I felt a little desire to smoke but no withdrawals like anxiety or fatigue or whatever, and after two weeks I don't feel desire to smoke no more, BUT.

Tiredness, irritability, fatigue, bad night sleep came into play. I knew it will come and was ready for it, but what I was not ready for is

Starting from the middle of the last week I started feeling that I'm becoming less smart: problem-solving seems to be a much harder task now, my memory falls off even though I take nootropics that greatly boosted my memory before, I'm feeling less concentrated, less focused, less self-collected, my performance is dropped down.

Generally speaking, I feel like I'm becoming blunt. 

I don't think it is because of bad night sleep - that was never a problem and I think 6-7 hours of sleep a day is enough for my brain to function properly

Is that normal? Have anyone experienced that before? Is there anything I can do about that? Will that ever end? I'm kinda scared that I won't be the same smart boi again haha (no jokes)

So, in May I stopped smoking after 9 years. After 4 weeks of remaining nicotine abstinent my brain fog and aggression kept increasing, no matter what I did. I started messing up university stuff etc.
I then started using nicorette 1mg quickmist spray. I‚Äòve been hooked eversince. I tried to stop using the spray many times, but everytime I quit I just get too psychotic and cant focus on anything anymore. 

The problem is, I‚Äòm in my Masters degree, got a lot of work on the side. I need my damn brain. 
When I think about it, the brain fog was always the one thing that kept me going back to nicotine.

I know life is a bit crummy for everyone thanks to the pandemic and for the one who are directly facing it‚Äôs impact such as job losses. In the midst of all this I decided to quit smoking. I don‚Äôt know how long this will last but I saw that I was smoking a lot recently like around 10-15 each day for the last 5 months or so compared to the usual 5 a day. 

It‚Äôs been sucky the nicotine addiction is real and on top that I‚Äôm going through some dating and career challenges but I just know smoking wont help me with those. It was just a habit where I would step out in fresh air, light up and ponder my thoughts. It‚Äôs funny but at-least for an hour after smoking my thoughts felt so clear but then I got concerned and had to light up again. It was a habit I had to break and I‚Äôm giving it a try.

Currently fighting off the cravings by resisting and popping some bite size chocolate candy whenever I get an urge to smoke. Not exactly healthy but at-least they are better than cigs. Any other advice would be appreciated. I‚Äôm gonna go working out from tomorrow and have also held off alcohol.",44,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.6322812438011169}"

Today I have decided that I want to quit cigarettes entirely. I am 20 years old and I was smoking around 20/day for the last couple years until this summer, at which point the use of vaping and nicotine pouches cut down my smoking quite significantly since then. I estimate that I now smoke around 2-3  cigarettes a day although sometimes more on days where I am socialising.

I am now committing to the sole use of vaping and nicotine pouches and I am reasonably confident that I will be able to cease smoking entirely. Since I am still quite young, I think its reasonable for me to continue to use nicotine products for now since I am addicted to nicotine and also enjoy it. Furthermore, stopping nicotine would increase the risk of me picking up smoking again. However, looking into the future I would prefer to eventually quit nicotine in any form. Are there any satisfying activities that do not involve nicotine which can be performed regularly during the day? Examples I can think of are having a mint instead of a nicotine product, or having a coffee. These two specific examples don't work for me, but I am looking for another activity which can replace nicotine.

But I don‚Äôt think I can do this alone so I'm sharing with you wonderful folks.

I've lurked here for a long time but I haven‚Äôt posted because I was afraid of the commitment required by sharing with others. The idea of going without forever scares me. I‚Äôm accustomed to failing myself but didn‚Äôt want to feel like I was failing others. I‚Äôm sorry if this post gets long but I need to share. I think it will help hold me to my decision.

So I‚Äôm 31, smoker since 14. I was smoking three packs a day before I left field work (lots of driving) and moved into manufacturing‚Ä¶then it dropped to one and a half. Starting last April, I would start the patch, go maybe 12 hours including 6 sleeping, then start up again. I finally bought Alan Carr‚Äôs amazing book and thanks to that I made it a week in January 2020 then gave up because I got dizzy. Over the last three weeks I have thrown at least a full carton in the trash only to buy more the next day. Thanks to my failure to stay stopped I‚Äôve now spent more than a month‚Äôs worth of cigarette money extra, but at least they‚Äôre not killing me. At least work will reimburse me for some of the NRT I have wasted.

I have been trying to make my bedtime cigarettes my last and be quit when I wake up. The problem with that is that when I had my bedtime cigarettes I‚Äôd browse reddit, which I am finding to be counterproductive, since it gets me out of my head and usually requires no thought. I realized I was creating positive reinforcement for my smoking. 

It‚Äôs getting cold out, it‚Äôs already expensive yet they‚Äôre increasing the sin-tax again, it‚Äôs killing me and keeping me from being in good shape. Most importantly: I AM an adult with self-discipline. I am making a grown-up choice, the right choice, and I will commit to it. To not smoke is what I want, so I am deciding not to. I will never smoke again, and it will be ok. I choose to never smoke again, that's why I threw them all out. Being free is what I want.

It might suck sometimes. And this will definitely be hard for me but this is it everyone! I‚Äôm a former-smoker!

My lungs were really starting to pay the price. Always out of breath; always feeling like I had a lead weight on my chest. Knew it was time to change. Decided to use nicotine gum. I really didn‚Äôt want to go through withdrawals while I was simultaneously trying to break the physical habit of it, and chewing gum gave me something to do- something to occupy my mind. Which turned out to be extremely necessary, as I didn‚Äôt realize how mentally consuming addiction is as well. I came to understand that I just had to form a new habit, and treated not smoking as the new habit, if that makes sense. 

Here‚Äôs some good news- I really did stop thinking about smoking. Cravings dissipated, and now I get grossed out when I smell someone smoking. You don‚Äôt realize how potent and disgusting it is until you haven‚Äôt been around it in a while. I get it now. I get that it‚Äôs a poison that I‚Äôve been killing myself with.

I'm over two months cigarette free. Spent the first two weeks doing the bare minimum of anything, just binged series in bed till I fell asleep, ate when hungry, then repeat. Then cravings stopped. I started exercising for the first time in my live and dropped 4 kilos (\~9 pounds). As my confidence about handling life without cigarettes grew, I started going out more and more. I would take my freelance job to coffee places and joined a certain martial art club.  

That's where second-hand smoking started bothering me and sorry in advance for the rambling. My past smoker self thought my city was effective in banning public smoking but apparently it is not. (It's effective in dealing with COVID hence the going out). Even with a mask on, I would suddenly pass smokers and inhale second-hand smoke while I'm walking in the streets, riding the bicycle, walking in underground parking lots, and even sitting in restaurants (happened twice last week!). Second-hand smoking is literally everywhere. I try to hold my breath but it's not always avoidable.  

Last week I started having cravings. They felt like physical ones but I thought it was psychological. Then it died down (yay!). Then yesterday I inhaled several times second-hand smoke. One of these occasions was a hallway full of smokers, and as I espaced to the staircase I realized there were more of them... Now I'm having physical cigarette cravings without psychologically wanting a cigarette. I don't want that fucking murderous motivation-killing machine that keep you hooked. But I feel irritated and all I can do is eat and eat and eat. I don't want to blame the smokers, I was one of them. I am confident I won't light another cigarette, but this is annoying, and I don't want to spend another two weeks binging series in bed since I have work to do. Have any of you had problems similar to mine and how do you deal with it? Or am I simply too obsessed with second-hand smoke?

Well, I put on my exercise clothes and began my usual weight lifting routine. With angry music playing I continued with one of my more aggressive workouts that I've had in a while.

And you know what? I felt great afterwards. Way more calm and relaxed. It was as if I was able to get all those angry and sad feelings out of me. Maybe it will work for you too!

Quitting smoking is not an isolated change I wish to make; I am shifting my whole perspective and attitude towards life around! I am becoming another person... I am becoming me! :)

And I am willing to *feel* what it's like to be me. To *feel* my pain instead of avoid it. To *feel* pleasure of the things I enjoy. To explore what enriches my life, by listening to my own reactions on things, and to stop the things that are bad for me.

I want to stop living in my head, and more in my body. I want to stop seeing things black and white, and realize that there's lots of beautiful colors.

It's up to me to open myself up to the beauty in life, and to deal with the hardship in a healthy way. Smoking is not, but many things are welcome. I do cold water swimming now, which is really giving me such good energy. I make new friends there, and it's (literally) a cool ritual that forces the body to respond to a challenge, strengthening the body in the process. And it's very relaxing, something you don't imagine if you have never done it before (like me a few months ago).

Also playing guitar, currently learning campfire songs to play with my friends. Have been playing for 15 years or so, but haven't memorized any new songs in years, nor learned any new techniques. Now I'd love to, not because I have to, but because to (really) life means to grow.

I want to be the old men who starts learning a new language to be able to speak to his neighbour, who plays music to make people happy, who many people can rely on for help and love. That means that I should first learn to be that for myself, to accept and love myself, and to help myself. I should find what energizes me to become the purest and most refined form of myself.

I am grateful that I can take another step into the good life by quitting smoking.

Probably what I'm about to say sounds stupid, but I want stop smoking. But I don't want to.
I do love smoking. I'm kind of prone to addictions.
When I was a child, I was always drawing, touching things. When I was older, I was addicted to eat I guess. After that I had some dangerous period with alcohol that I happily stopped on time.
I don't drink often and if I do it's only a social thing. I've reached a good weight (finally) and hitting the gym but for the rest I'm not very happy with my life.
I feel that smoking it's the only thing that I have left.
I love the alone moments smoking, thinking or not often, sharing. I've always loved everything related to smoke. It's like if I quit I'll lose a huge part of myself.
I don't care much about the abusive price of tobacco products. I'll buy them. I don't care much about the health issues as I've made a lot to improve it plus of course I know about the risk of smoking but I really don't care much.
Sometimes I think that I would like to have one cigarette occasionally but in the reality I just can't because I really do enjoy smoking. Crazy enough, I hate to need anything so hard.

Sometimes I choose to fight it and ignore it but other times I give in and I smoke CBD for that craving instead. I‚Äôm not sure if this even counts as being in the process of stopping. If you guys have any advice or tips on how I may improve my will to stop I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it.,0,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.8009553551673889}"

From 20 to 25 a day to just the patch to no patch. I was smoke free for 7 months and nicotine free for 5.

Remember when you only smoked when you drank?

And then you smoked when you drank AND at lunch break?

And then when you drank, at lunch break and then after dinner?

And then and then and then. Boom. Pack a day.

I went through that same cycle after 7 months ""quit"" except rather than taking years to creep into my life like the addiction originally did, it was back in full force within a month or so.  And I knew it. I recognized what was happening, but tomorrow was always the day to rectify the clearly fucking visible path I was on. Pushing it to tomorrow absolved me of responsibility today. 

What an insidious addiction. All those addiction synapses came right back to life. And my body screamed, ""YOURE POISONING ME!"". Headaches, lethargy, lack of focus, increased heart rate as I began to regularly poison myself. Of course, my body has re-adapted to the poison now and I'm ""fine"" other than being addicted, low stamina and killing myself slowly.

And I KNOW, I know for a fact, from experience, that I just have to eat my shit sandwich for 5 to 7 days with the help of the patch and then the mountain that I thought was so impassable is really just a steep hill. I KNOW I'll be nearly free after 60 days and every day after the first week or so gets substantially easier.

Yet I'm still trapped. Its so ridiculous typing it. I know how I am talking the power of this addiction up in my own mind. How ""easily"" it can be defeated. Yet I'm still trapped.

I just bought a fresh carton today. I got 190 or so fucking cigarettes. They will be smoked in a week or so. Then I'll buy another. And another. All for the privilege of not even really enjoying my smokes 9 out of 10 times and likely dying younger.

I have recently decided that I want to quit smoking. It's bad for my health and my funds. I feel like I would be able to run x4 as much if I didn't smoke. I also feel like I wouldn't be so tired all the time. 

I don't want to take any substitutes (like Nicorette or something). I just want to quit.

I have been smoking for the past 5 or so years. I was smoking a pack a day for the past year. Then I got it to half a pack. Now I started smoking rollies, and I make sure to not bring any with me when I go outside. I only roll in the house. I now smoke around 5-7 rollies a day.

Another thing I do to smoke less is that when I feel like smoking, I go for a run. When I come back, my breathing is too messed up so I don't feel like smoking. 

Now, how should I go about quitting smoking? Should I keep on gradually reducing how much I smoke or should I just quit right off the bat? Anything to watch out for? Any recommendations?

Lastly, I feel like the biggest problem is that I LOVE to smoke. To me, smoking is art. Nothing better than to kick back, light up and relax with some tunes on. I used to do this back when I smoked weed but I quit, so ciggies have become my substitute.

I want to quit smoking. I want to win against this evil demon.

I have a long history with nicotine, but have never been particularly dependent or found it that crave worthy or enjoyable, I guess I am lucky in this way. I have smoked off and on, usually socially. I also used to roll a spliff or two each day for a while. I never noticed that much of an issue when I went back to pure weed, but Im not sure I paid enough close attention. I tend not to be in that good of a place in general, so maybe I just figured it was my normal mood fluctuations or something at the time, or maybe it doesnt mess with my nervous system that hard compared to others, as withdrawal and dependence is a spectrum.

Recently some guy that was quitting gave me his disposable vape. I enjoyed it and bought a couple more. I also figured out how to recharge them, so people would give me their old ones for free so i could do that. Generally I am careful about drug dependence, as I have lots of experience in that scene and know what it is like, but with nicotine I got lazy, as I never found it very psychologically addictive, and so let my guard down. Well the days turned into weeks turned into a month, so now im pretty sure I will have physical withdrawals. I was wondering what I should expect from that? This is probably kind of a dumb question, as i shall see soon enough and no one can really tell me for sure, but id like to be semi prepared. Reading the posts it seems like some people get absolutely destroyed, and I really am hoping that is not the case with me, after so little time in comparison.  Im on like 14 hrs rn and havent noticed anything, but I also have very bad insomnia atm, so the lack of attention and cognitive decline that some mention might be covered up by the fact that I am already fried (got 3.5 hrs last night). I dont think i will have much problems not smoking, but only time will tell. Thanks

Edit: forgot to say the dipsoable vapes are like 5% nic which is pretty fucked. Some days I def hit them waay too much. Its much easier than hitting a stoge and doesnt feel as satisfying so you just keep going ime.

From learning that the cigs were just a coping mechanism for a legitimate anxiety disorder, to going into therapy and essentially turning my life and more importantly my mindset towards almost anything by 180 degrees and quitting my excessive drinking in the meantime, let's just say I had an eventful last 8 months. I even completed my first sub 2h half marathon, which was always my 'non-smoking fitst milestone'.
But a few days ago it hit me; I haven't had a proper craving in what seemed like months and everything appeared sort of 'normal'. Sure, uni started again and the days got shorter, but I just hoped that all the good things I learned over the past months would help me through the rougher months. But this was almost unlike any other craving I ever felt. This one was (and still is) consistent and persistent. It's not like I'm dying for a smoke or anything, it's a constant feeling of just wanting to go back again for the better. I'm running out of reasons why I shouldn't just pick it up again. My health is not really an argument for me, especially since there is vapes, which carry a lot less of the health risks. Plus my mental health would atleast momentarily improve because the nicotine was essentially and prematurely cancelling any anxiety- or panicattack. I'm looking for a legitimate reason why I shouldn't smoke. Because comparing everything right now, picking it up would actually be worth the downsides because of the problems it would solve.
I'm not going to start smoking again. I know that I quit 8 months ago and I know that I must've definitely had my reasons.. Just because I'm at a worse spot, emotionally, right now I don't want to jeopardize my progress. If anyone has some advice on where else to get the calmness and peace of mind that nicotine gives you in the short-run view, I would highly appreciate that. The past few days, with the lockdown measures increasing again, I'm feeling increasingly lonely and I have a feeling that this is also a huge contributing factor. Let's see how it goes, but I encourage you all to stay on track and keep going. I don't know if this is actually a question or just me trying to somehow get a hold of my current mental state. If you guys have had similar experiences, I'd gladly hear about them and maybe I'll find some ways to deal with my situation that I didn't look at before.

I quit cold turkey using patches 2 or 3 months ago (can't afford patches right now), but allowed myself drags off of friends cigarettes, which turned into finishing theirs, which turned into one or two every now and then, which turned into vaping constantly fiending for my next smoke. The reason this is so difficult for me is that I hang around smokers every day. I'm disabled so I'm hitting that vape constantly all day every day (I go through a bottle and a half a month). I put it in the bedroom about 10 minutes ago to try to give it a rest and it's all I can think about. I don't have real friends. I have glorified drinking buddies. They are good people and I love them, but all we do when we hang out is drink, play chess, and smoke. That's what broke me the last time I quit. I would go days without a cigarette (I had quit vaping for about a month at that point), but found it impossible to be with them and not smoke.

That led me back to vaping. I figured since I couldn't refrain from smoking while drinking, I'd vape. That didn't work out so well because I got hooked back on the vape hard and have gone back to pretty much ignoring it while I'm drinking and just smoke cigarettes. I am an alcoholic. I get drunk pretty much every 3 days. I have MDD, chronic anxiety, and schizoaffective disorder so drinking is not just the only way I can open up and have fun, it's the only way I can be around my ""friends"" and not be so uncomfortable that I have to leave after 15 minutes. It's agonizing and the alcohol fixes that for a few hours. That's a big problem because I can't drink and not smoke at the same time. As self-destructive as my drinking is, it's not something I'm willing to give up just yet.

Here's where I'm at with this and I would appreciate your thoughts. I'm not going to stop hanging out with my friends and I'm not going to stop drinking. I will try to drink less often, but it's still going to be a once or twice a week thing at the least. My plan now is to vape for the time being and not smoke any cigarettes at all. No shorties, no drags, no butts. Once I've gone a couple months without a single cigarette, I will start mixing the 3% nicotine vape juice with 0% juice until I'm only vaping juice with 0% nicotine. Then I will work on getting off the vape. I think this is the only course of action, because I keep trying to quit cold turkey and I keep breaking.

*Quitting smoking won‚Äôt magically make me happy and love myself. I‚Äôll still be f‚Äôed up. But that‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôs better to be a f‚Äôed up non-smoker than an f‚Äôed up smoker.*

So many quitting resources are like: ‚ÄúI feel so awesome! I‚Äôm so happy now! I‚Äôm exercising now and feel so healthy! And you will too! Yay!‚Äù

But I think part of me saw that and thought... I can‚Äôt imagine myself being that way. I don‚Äôt have high self-esteem and don‚Äôt really put my health first. I don‚Äôt like exercising.

But all of the sudden, while having a good long think about it in the shower, I got my AH-HA moment!

*I don‚Äôt have to magically exercise, eat right, and be happy to be a non-smoker. I can just be a non-smoker. And I can feel at least a little happier because of that, and that‚Äôs better than before.*

So tonight, I‚Äôm going to have my LAST cigarette, and starting tomorrow, my mantras are gonna be things like: 

‚ÄúDamn, I‚Äôm having a craving, I‚Äôm so f‚Äôed up. But at least I‚Äôm a non-smoker now.‚Äù

‚ÄúMan, I‚Äôm still procrastinating on this paper. I‚Äôm so f‚Äôed up. But at least I‚Äôm a non-smoker now.‚Äù

(When passing smokers) ‚ÄúI‚Äôm f‚Äôed up but at least not THAT f‚Äôed up.‚Äù

See the trend? 

I don‚Äôt have to love myself to be a non-smoker. I can just be a non-smoker, which is a step toward loving myself in a way... but I won‚Äôt FORCE anything. It‚Äôll just come naturally. And I look forward to it, and you know what? That makes me happy. :)",274,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9694990515708923}"

I have quit smoking 6 times in the last 7 weeks and I'm actually going out of my mind. I make it a week, 5 days, 6 days, 2 days whatever and then I'm back on them and hating myself.

I'm 33, and I can't fuckin breathe. Morning time is the biggest trigger - so the second I wake up I have to stick on a patch. However, I'm up with the baby at 6.30 and I usually exercise about 8am ish. Everything ive read strongly advises against wearing a patch when exercising vigorously so how the fuck do I manage the first 2 hours of my day?!! I have to get up with babs so this isn't flexible either and this is what keeps messing me up!

If I wake up and don't put on a patch I'm like a raging psychopath within a half hour.
If I don't exercise I'm a miserable depressed self-loathing bastard.
I HATE the nicorette inhalator. HATE HATE HATE it. So that doesn't work as a stop gap.

The patches don't restick after exercise and they are soooo fucking expensive so I can't justify using 2 a day.

So after a few days the morning cravings vs need to exercise leads to absolute failure. 

Any suggestions on coping with the morning times? Without telling me to suck it the fuck up and put on my big girl pants please lol. Telling myself that hasn't worked thus far :-|

As the time passes, my mind is playing me tricks. In there, I'm cured from my addiction.
I don't have the technicality to explain the phenomena but I think I have two brains. One is constantly trying to deceive me and the other one, most of the times is aware of that.
The first on is telling me that actually, it is not that hard to quit smoking. Of course, it only shows up in a moment when I'm actually not craving it what, in spite of not as regularly, still happens quite often. 
That one knows that I might feel even more tempted in the end. Fall for it over the belief that it won't be that hard to leave again. 

Have a good one,

I did this even though I could literally feel the anxiety getting worse with each drag I took.

Nothing more than a rant. And I don't want any praise or congratulations - if anything, heckle me. Praise would do more damage and make it feel more fake.

I'm 41 days in.. And it's tough. This is my 2nd effort ever at quitting, and I've basically smoked like a chimney for 16 years. I've taken both attempts very seriously though - lasting for over 4 months the first now, and now here I am the second.

This addiction is so insidious-- and so glossed over by most typical people-- that it's ridiculous. For me, and I understand it's simply my journey and might not be applicable for everyone, but the '3 days and you're good' was such an misnomer. The first 3 days certainly was a shift in my schedule... And I'm sure I had some mood shifts... But largely were fine. The random Tuesdays or Sunday nights since then have been murder. 

I know, simply biologically, there's no physical need for nicotine. I truly don't think that ever was the issue to me though. My buddy, who has quit with me and always been tortured by nicotine addiction, tells me constantly its about quitting nicotine. Which it is - that's literally the drug we crave. But for me, it's 100% quitting smoking. If I smoke cbd, weed, or you could wrap up parsley, it's the same issue for me. Whereas I've never been tempted once to chew tobacco, nicotine gum, put nicotine patches on, etc. My issue is truly smoking.

And, despite it being possibly a hot point, I do think it will easily be proven weed isn't detrimental - if I like smoking something, I could find ways of getting weed. But actually I truly don't like weed. Cbd, similarly, but it's quite expensive when you think of going from a pack and a half per day of cigarettes to cbd cigs. I've.. Never tried smoking parsley but I think I'll try just getting some suckers or something before that.

My last cigarette was in June. I seamlessly swapped smoking for vaping, and weaned down the nicotine % in the vape juice to the lowest (3%). In my mind this was a perfect plan for quitting. I now think that was a total crap idea. Threw the vape away five days ago and have started to go through the withdrawals that seem just as bad as if I had just went straight cold turkey. 

I think I am doing okay fighting off the constant cravings and going through what I assume are the normal ups and downs of this process (read: I am a terrible moody monster)‚Ä¶ but if anything is going to cause a relapse its gonna be the desire to get some sleep.

I‚Äôve read Carr a few times, found it very helpful in realizing what I‚Äôm dealing with, but not exactly helpful in how to deal with it. I had an 8 day quit, then had ‚Äòjust one‚Äô and fell back. That was about a year ago now, and I just haven‚Äôt felt that wave of excitement to quit come back. And then the pandemic happened and I lost my job, so I‚Äôm home doing full time school and all the time to smoke. 
The things I‚Äôve learned through journaling and reading here and Carr are that this doesn‚Äôt need to be a big deal. This is good and a decisive step towards a healthier life. Every time I smoke I think of all the reasons I hate it - from the little squeak in my throat in the morning to the smell to even just having to go to the store. It‚Äôs awful. I hate every aspect sincerely. Yet I wake up on my ‚Äòquit‚Äô days and all I want is a cig with my coffee. Which is stupid because that‚Äôs really the most painful smoke of the day. And during that 8 day quit I actually remember feeling so good, just like truly elated and happy which was not what I was expecting. And I want to get back to that. 


Anyways, I feel like I truly understand this thing. And I feel like I know the tricks. But I just can‚Äôt make up my mind. Do I do it now? On thanksgiving break? As a New Years resolution?

I‚Äôve been practicing meditation for about 3 months now, and recently I started trying to be mindful as I smoke. I try to feel every sensation that occurs as I smoke, noticing how I crave the cigarette and how it affects the mind and body. It has actually quite drastically changed my relationship to cigarettes. 

Today I went to a hill to have a cigarette, but decided to meditate first. I sat down with my back straight, closed my eyes and focused on my breath. 10 minutes in, I decided to have a cigarette as I was meditating, so I lighted it with my eyes still closed. At first I noticed the burning sensation in my throat when inhaling the smoke. Then my heart started beating faster, gradually making my whole body tremble. It felt like I was getting sick. It was mindblowingly uncomfortable to be so present in my body when smoking. Even though it felt horrible, I lighted another one to really experience it. At this point my body was so restless and my heart was beating like crazy. It felt impossible to keep my back straight for any longer so i sank down and put out the cigarette.

To anyone struggling with nicotine addiction, I can highly recommend involving your mindfulness practice. cigarettes for me used to be something you just do, when hanging with friends or whatever. The craving we experience is a lack of understanding what smoking really feels like. We understand that we get a little dizzy and so on, but being mindful when smoking completely changes the perspective. It changes from ‚Äúlet me go enjoy a smoke‚Äù to something like ‚Äúlet me go unpleasantly inhale some smoke that makes me tremble and feel restless and sick.‚Äù 

Don‚Äôt try to force quitting, quit when you fully understand it and don‚Äôt desire it anymore.

5 years ago, I was a smoker. A heavy smoker, actually. With 35 years old, since I was 18, I used to smoke a pack a day (when I was not going out... otherwise... 2, 3 packs?) I knew it was bad for me, and I felt it on my health and well-being. But, you know, smoking was stronger than me. I knew I should quit, but whenever I had a dinner, a party or a night out... Cigarettes were an essential part of the joy, and no day was a good day to quit.

I remember once I was 5 days without smoking. That was my record! But then, I had a dinner with friends, and I went back on smoking and I felt really sorry for myself. I thought, ""I will always be a smoker and probably I will die because of cigarettes""; and that thought made me really sad... I was condemned with 35 years old only...

On the 14th November 2015, I went to see a ballet performance with friends and afterwards we had dinner at a restaurant. Once we left the restaurant, I only had one cigarette. I thought ""I have to buy cigarettes before going home!"" But at the same time, I decided to go home and quit smoking for the XXXth time...

I didn't have much faith on it. But I decided to keep it going no matter what. Somehow, I thought, ""The time has come!"". And what you really need is a day 1 to start: There were some days that I wanted to climb walls, to cry, to shout, but, eventually, it all went away. I remember to come here to REDDIT every single day seeking for support. And, today, 5 years after my first day, I decided to come here once again to dedicate this victory to all of you that supported me back then and to all of you here today determined to quit smoking. To all that are in day 1, day 1 and 1 hour, day 2, day 5, day 10, day 10 and a half (every single minute counts), 1 month, 3 months, 1 year.... YES, it is possible!

I never thought it would be possible for me to become an ex-smoker. But it is. And let me tell you guys, it was the BEST DECISION I HAVE EVER MADE!

Keep strong! No matter what. You will manage as well.

for the past 2 years I have been constantly telling myself that I‚Äôd stop and I tried but I also always told myself ‚Äújust one more‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll try to cut down first‚Äù it obviously never worked. I even tried patches but I was still smoking with them so again it never worked. 

But I knew it had to stop. My voice had started cracking, I was wheezing and coughing. Before the past 2 years I rarely ever coughed. My ocd also constantly made me over think the possibility of cancer. 

I live with my family and they all smoke, all my friends smoke so I‚Äôm constantly around it. I thought I‚Äôd never have a chance at quitting until I moved out away from people that smoked.  

This went on until Wednesday when I decided not to have another cig 2 hours before I went to sleep, I also had a patch on. When I woke up that morning I decided not to smoke and I think that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm now on 2 days without smoking any cigarettes. I‚Äôm using the patches and will continue to do step one for a week, then step 2 then 3 and then hopefully I‚Äôll be off nicotine for good. 

I have used a vape to get me through the first day but I don‚Äôt plan on using it any longer if I can. I know it‚Äôs still very early for me to celebrate not smoking but I‚Äôm proud of myself. This is the longest I‚Äôve ever gone without smoking. For 7 years I couldn‚Äôt even go an hour without a cigarette. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm terrified, this has been my routine for 7 years and I never thought I‚Äôd be strong enough to go 2 days even with patches but for now I‚Äôm happy (:

Today marks my 12 year anniversary of a separation of a dear friend that I had close relationship with for nearly 20 years. A friend that was always there through thick and thin, was there to calm me down when I was mad, and just in general kept me company on long road trips.

But was also a friend that limited me, where I went, and who I could and would visit. A friend that unbeknownst to me, dictated a huge part of my life. Someone I thought could do no wrong and bent over backwards for. The last year leading to our breakup, I had exactly realized how much of my life had been robbed by this friend. How limiting they were and how it affected my family. It was after another good friend was able to successfully cut ties with my friend, I realized that I, too, could cut ties forever.

Thanks to a good friend, I realized I could, in fact, quit smoking. So long, to living my life, looking for the next location to have a smoke. Going outside in all sorts of weather, to have a smoke. Having to tip-toe and hide around certain people, to have a smoke. Running though the airport to find a smoking lounge between flights. Having that eau de cigarette odor. Realizing how much time, energy, and money that has, literally, gone up in smoke. It has not always been easy, and I've had to keep my eye on the prize, but I know my life is much better off without my blinding addiction. Set a date that was important to me, and kept my promise to be done with it forever.

TWELVE years.

Not a single cigarette, not a single drag (as I believe I would be right back). It does not bother me as much, now, but I know there are days where I could make up with my friend, and have to make a conscientious decision to stay away.

The addiction is strong, and for a long time, I was weak. Knowing that I have had close family that have died as a direct result of smoking wasn‚Äôt a deterrent. Sin taxing wasn‚Äôt a deterrent. People telling my how bad it was (duh!) didn‚Äôt help. After I realized that someone (I perceived) was a heavier smoker was able to quit, it opened my eyes to a possibility that I could do it. So I do want to give a quick thanks to those that are close to me for having to put up with me during my journey! Maybe I will be around longer to aggravate you! To those of you, my friends and acquaintances, or anyone reading my story, that thinks they are resolved to a life of smoking, that it is too hard, or you have been at it for too long, just know, that if you have the will to quit, you CAN.

But you have to be honest with yourself, and do it for yourself, not at anyone else‚Äôs behest. If you resolve to quit on your own terms, you will succeed, as I have.

BEST TIPS

Don't wait till New Years to quit smoking. Start 2021 with success already behind you.

You cannot have one puff. Okay just one. No! Not one puff. If one puff is okay, then two is okay, and you're down the hole all over again.

Quitting means turning over one thousand ""stones"" or triggers. I quit many times before I got it right. Each time I failed, I learned a bit more about the challenges of quitting an addiction. Now I am mentally much stronger, and that pay off in all kinds of ways, e.g., healthy eating, fitness, etc.

Three days, three weeks, three months. That's what it takes. It will take three days to be free of the physical withdrawal symptoms. It will take three weeks to break the mental habit, the routines and mental associations, e.g., smoking on a break. It takes three months to finally be free of the emotional traps, of imagining that smoking is somehow nice. 

Think clearly, the only pleasure of smoking is relief from withdrawal, caused by the last cigarette. When you understand that there is no intrinsic pleasure in smoking, you will be free, easily. Thank you Allen Carr!

When you are in a tough spot with quitting, play the ""tape"" forward. I.e., you know what happens next. You break down, have one smoke, feel a short ""relief"" which is only a temporary relief from the effort of quitting, then you feel like crap for smoking, and have to quit all over again. Play this ""tape"" forward, and it will be easier to avoid smoking.

Do I think about smoking? Sure, every now and then I remember than I used to smoke. It seems weird, like an illness I used to have but it's gone. I do not crave cigarettes.

Breathing freely is really nice. Breathing is my new hobby. I teach a meditation class. Even one conscious breath is a meditation. Inhale through your nose, slowly. Notice the sensations of breathing. Exhale even longer. You will feel great. 

Best to you all!

I only found out he smoked about 4 months in; he knew I was against it and so hid it from me, but he said that he ""quit"" when we first started talking because of how well we got along. Well, in my mind, quit means quit altogether. He didn't quit, he had one when something majorly stressful happened (that's when I first found out), and I told him to never have one again; I really didn't think he was an addict, I guess it was my fault because I was too afraid to discuss it and get my feelings hurt at the time, but then a few weeks later we were walking around town and a vape that his roommate gave him fell out of his pocket. He told me he didn't use it, he wanted to get rid of it before I found out about it. I told him I'd rather him tell me the truth when he smokes, even if we're not together at the time, than him go behind my back, because it would still affect me (if he kisses me, for example, after smoking).

Anyways... for the past 2 months, it's been a huge source of tension for us. He hasn't smoked in three months, and I've realized, instead of celebrating that, I've been anxious and angry that he still has the cravings to smoke. And I realized this because I have never and will never understand addiction; I have never done any drugs, and I rarely drink alcohol, maybe 3-4 times in a year. So any time he gets an urge, I just can't comprehend it and it makes me so angry, but I don't want to be angry. This weekend we met up with a friend of mine, and after stepping outside of the restaurant, a waiter was outside having a smoke break, and my friend lit up a cigarette to chat with him. I stood a few metres away because I didn't want to inhale the smoke, and I'll be honest, I was completely disgusted.

I could tell, however, that my boyfriend wanted to smoke. He was lingering beside them, trying to chat with them, clearly trying to inhale it, and for a second I really thought he was going to ask for one. He didn't, and instead of congratulating him, I just bottled up my anger and the next morning he admitted to me he wanted to smoke, and I put him down. I shouldn't have done that, I know.

I want to be supportive. I haven't REALLY discussed his feelings on smoking; he agrees there are no benefits, there are only risks that increase if he smokes, that he has nothing to gain, etc, but he still wants to. So when I hear that, I just freak out and make it about me. But I want to understand his perspective without getting so anxious and upset. When I hear he only wants to quit smoking for me and not for himself, that terrifies me because I have read and heart thousands of stories of people who ""quit"" for their partners but eventually had one at a social event, then another, then another, then became a regular smoker, and I'm afraid of that happening. So, I want him to quit for himself, but I guess I haven't given him the chance to really see that either, that he can enjoy life without one for his own sake, and not for mine. And I guess, for the time being, I have to accept that his motivation for quitting is me, because it's better than nothing, and it's better than him being in denial.

So I wrote out a few things I want to go over with him:

I want to know how it feels for him to smoke, why he does it, what his cravings and triggers are, how he feels after smoking, how it started, and if he believes there are any replacements he can use.

I guess my question is: what else can I ask him or discuss with him? How can I encourage him, and help make him see that what he's doing is for his own benefit too, not just for mine and not just for our relationship?

I also plan on asking him to please phone or text me when he's out with friends who are smoking and he gets that craving, so we can talk it through, and I can help him calm down and not give into it. .Is that a good idea?

I also bought Allan Carr's book. I read it, and understand a bit more why smokers smoke, and I want him to read it. He wants to for me, but I can tell he is still resisting, he hasn't read it yet. Should I check up with him, remind him to, or wait that he decides to?",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9980518817901611}"

Well turns out hitting a menthol after smoking weed just makes you smoke menthols after a while. 

Anyway. I've been wanting to quit for a couple years now, but now I'm pregnant and I NEED to quit. I've cut back drastically since finding out I was pregnant, before I was up to almost two full packs a day and now I'm down to about half a pack or less. But I can't seem to completely kick the habit. I constantly feel guilty for lighting up, but my craving outweighs the guilt more often than not.

She quit about 2 months ago. She overcame physical addiction issues pretty easily. What's the real problem for her though, is the habit of going out to the balcony and having a cig to chill a bit either during intense working hours or after she's been doing something for several hours straight (non-work-related, yet something that requires concentration). So, for her, it was a way to wind out for a bit, relax after going hard and restore before she continues. She even claims that this issue with not being able to chill makes her even less happy than it was before.

I myself was a smoker as well since I was 16. Quit 2 or 3 times for about a year during the last 14 years. I've quit about half a year ago. Mostly every time I quit smoking is because of health issues. So, while I'm forced to do it, neither I have any problems with physical addiction (perhaps because I start feeling better in just a few days), nor I have any problems with dropping the habit itself. But her is a different story. She needs something to help her to wind out for a bit to restore. Smoking cigs was a working solution was that purpose, but it's not quite an option in a long term (took me about 2 years to build a conscious understanding of this in her).

So the question is - are there any safe-for-health replacement options for smoking? Vape is not an option since it hits you in different places compared to tobacco. IQOS still has nicotine, and it smells like a fart. One of our friends has the same issue after quitting recently as well, but he solves it in a rather ridiculous way - he rolls and smokes dry mint leaves.

I decided to create an account to share my struggle and maybe read some wise words. 

I'm a 25yo female and I started smoking in July, about 6-8 cigarettes a day. I tried to quit 3 or 4 times, because I don't see myself as a smoker in the future and I never smoke in public. I failed those other times, but on Monday I tried again and I felt pretty well about this decision. But now it's getting harder. All I can think of are cigs, I have ZERO energy and feel like crying (I know, it's stupid, but I feel helpless). I'm mad at myself for even starting this habit, I did this to myself. This time I told myself to at least TRY to live without cigarettes for a week and then, if I'm still craving them, I'll get a pack. I think I'm negotiating with myself - I've heard that the first 4/5 days are the hardest, so I'm hoping that after  7 days I just won't need a new pack. I think my main problem is that I smoked too little and for a relatively short amount of time and didn't experience any negative aspects of smoking (besides the money I spent). Maybe if I had some smoke related health issues, it would be easier to quit. I know it's all in my head and I have the power to quit, but that little voice inside me keeps telling me ""Hey, you could smoke for another month and then quit! Why not quit on January 1st?"". I know that quitting won't be any easier a month and a half from now, if anything, it'll be even harder. I feel like I'm missing out on something when I'm not smoking. I miss those five minutes of pure bliss, when nothing else existed but me and my cigarette. I feel so stupid writing this, but I'm sure at least one person will relate to this and maybe tell me what to do.

A little background first: I'm 23 years old and have been smoking for about 9 years now. I know, I was ridiculously young but what's done is done. For the past few years I've been smoking something between 10 and 20 cigarettes each day.

As most of us probably know, the actual addiction to nicotine isn't that hard to kick and I'm pretty sure that's true for me, too. However, I've been trying to quit for as long as I can think but never managed to stick to it. I think I finally figured out why.

I have been smoking for such a long time that by now it really feels like it's a part of me. I've also never met anyone who smokes more than me - this isn't supposed to be some weird brag btw, I know that there are plenty of people who do, I just don't know any of them. The reason I'm mentioning this is because most of my friends have noticed this too and so it feels like smoking is a part of me not just in my own head but in theirs, too. Because not only am I a smoker they know but I'm the biggest one, ya know?

And as weird as it sounds, I enjoy that. I enjoy being the hot mess of a friend who drinks too much, swears too much and, well, smokes too much.

Which brings me to my question: how do I separate smoking from my personality? How do I stop thinking it's - and trust me, I know how stupid I am for thinking this - ""cool""?

I‚Äôve tried to quit many times in the past, and this time round is probably the easiest I‚Äôve found it. However my sleep now seems to be suffering which hasn‚Äôt happened before. 

So pre quit, I was SUCH a heavy sleeper. I would not wake once in the night and was an absolute nightmare when it came to waking up i.e. sleeping through full volume alarms. Fast forward to now, every tiny sound throughout the night is waking me up and it‚Äôs taking me forever to get back to sleep. I‚Äôm also waking up ridiculously early every morning, regardless of how late I went to sleep or how many disturbances there was during the night. 

I guess my question is, has anyone had the same experience? Is it a long lasting thing?

I am 11 days nicotine-free and it was an awesome experience until now.

A few years ago I read Alan Carr's book and I did not listen and I've replaced cigarettes with an e-cigarette.

All was fine for a period of time, but was starting to vape everywhere and at any time, even in bed at night. My sleep was degrading and for me to get to sleep it started to take 1-2 hours and I was not understanding why. The reason was simple: nicotine was keeping me active and gave me chili sweats.

So I read again the book and I decided this is the time I won't take this poison anymore!

Luckily, the first two days I had to do some hard physical work which did not give me any spare time to think about cigarettes. The first night I remember it was weird because I was so happy that I do not have any symptoms, but when I got in bed I had some weird sensations of temperature change for about 2 hours.

The hardest craving I had was on day 10 because after a nice trekking with some climbing I really wanted a cigarette. It was a bit disturbing for me because psychologically it was easy to stop smoking until then, but I was wondering why my mind wants a cigarette exactly when my lungs are in a place with such a good air quality? That was something that kept me thinking that nicotine is such a pervert substance.

Now after 11 days I noticed that I am having some mood changes but I am sure that I do not want to smoke ever again and those last symptoms will also disappear.

Background: Smoking 8 years in total. Started off socially smoking, managed to work my way up to a pack a day towards the end. I have a young family who I want to be around for as they grow older. I want to be present for all those magical moments. 

Tried many different methods of quitting. In summary:
1. Went cold turkey twice, longest time of the two being a little over 3 months but still craved cigarettes every time I saw one. 

2. Tried vaping for periods. Honestly, my chest was far worse than when I smoked. Saw a chief surgeon/consultant just to get to the bottom of it and he basically said to keep smoking cigarettes. He said vaping is deadly. Strange, I know. So I was back to square one. 

3. Final straw I said I'd try Champix (varenicline). I was terrified after reading the reviews online and on here. The side effects looked terrifying. 



I'm currently on day 32 of Champix and quit on day 7. I've experienced a couple of side effects, these were:
1. Short fuse at times, which I found every other time I quit. So I can't point my finger at the Champix. I noticed this and put it in check very quick. 
2. Sweating during sleep. Bad dreams/nightmares at the start. Again, nothing crazy. 

I have had no cravings for nicotine. Zero want for a cigarette. It's brilliant. 

I would definitely recommend people on here to try if they have tried everything else. Take the other reviews with a pinch of salt. I honestly thought I was going to turn into a suicidal murderer. Didn't happen. 

A few questions for Champix users/finishers:
1. I will be doing 3 months of the treatment. If you finished it, did you crave cigarettes after quitting Champix?
2. What side effects did you find when quitting the medication?

This is, I think, my 5th quit? I started smoking 26 years ago and have spent about 5 of those years as a nonsmoker. Once for 2 years, once for 16 months, once for 10 months, and once for about a month and a half. All of my quits have been fairly easy. Cravings for a couple days, then they died off for the most part. I'd get an occasional craving but nothing super hard to get past, just annoying. I always restart during a very stressful event. 

This time is way different. I'm 2.5 weeks in and every day is a STRUGGLE. Like, I was in bed crying earlier tonight about how badly I want a cigarette. Every single evening I spend agonizing hours just being angry and sad that I want a cigarette. I don't want to crave them like this, I'm ready for it to be over. I try to distract myself, but nothing makes the thoughts go away. And it's not just thoughts, it's like my entire body wants to smoke. 

I started reading Allen Carr's book a week or so ago but I'm not very far into it. So far it hasn't done anything for me at all. I almost want to start smoking again while I read it so I quit on better footing, but I'm pretty sure that's just my brain making excuses about why I should smoke again.

Does anyone have any tips? This is honestly very emotionally exhausting. Not sure how much longer I can go without actually smoking. I can't handle these long, hard cravings much longer.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9984097480773926}"

I know none of what I'm feeling is the truth, I know it is all in my head and as the days go by my habit will be completely changed and I won't have those thoughts.

Have not spoken to my support system (friends, family) about this yet..

  
I have had an unhealthy relationship with alcohol basically all my life, as far as I remember.  
Realizing that alcohol is a bigger part of the whole addiction equation than I thought.

I finally broke the depression/ I want to die 10 years earlier so why put in the effort to quit excuse for the first time this week, something that's made me fail prob 20 of the 25 other times. I think my problem might be I want an excuse to feel bad. If I've recently quit, I can blame my shitty mood on withdrawal. I think I'm scared of having to deal with the fact that sometimes we're just gonna feel shitty; it's a fact of life and smoking won't help that. I understand that logically, so why do I keep going back? Is this just addiction? I feel like I'm stuck in a never ending pattern of smoke and feel bad, quit with withdrawal and feel bad, give in and feel bad. Why can't I just accept that smoking will never NEVER give me the pleasure I fantasize about? I'm gonna smoke/vape for a bit because of the shitty 15 min buzz, then my tolerance will raise again and I'll need cigs/vapes just to feel normal. I know if I smoke a single cigarette/vape theres a 99% chance I'll get caught in that loop again, so why do I toy with the idea of getting myself hooked and making myself suffer all over again?

The election has my anxiety on high and today I caved, bought a pack, and smoked half of a cig. I thought it would calm me down and make my craving stop. In all reality it tasted the same way it did when I was a teenager, kind of gross and not fulfilling whatsoever.   
I'm not really seeking advice, this subreddit has helped a lot reading other people's stories and experiences and tips. I thought I'd just hop on and say, I tried it, it was gross, and here's to more smoke free days in my future.   
I would love to hear other's experience with slip ups. Do you start counting your smoke free days all over again, or is that disappointing?",3,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9890463948249817}"

Years ago I had a friend give me the book Allan Karr wrote on quiting smoking. So I started to read that, and sure enough a few pages later I just turned away from it just like that. I did not completely quit since I am currently vaping, but nonetheless its been 4 days, 21h since writing this post. 

For those of you who want to quit but can't, I highly recommend Allan karr's book.

Anyway, I already screwed up and had a smoke this morning. My game plan has always been to smoke right up until I go to bed and then the next day it's cold turkey - so long as I managed to keep enough cigarettes on me. Running out mid  day is not an option and always leads to buying another pack and then subsequently having half a pack the next morning I wake up..

Somehow the stars aligned and I woke up with 2 cigarettes left. I should have just tossed them, but I'm resolved not to go buy another pack regardless. I figure I might as well go kill this last smoke and get it out of the way..

I can't keep doing this yo, my lung capacity is so fucking trash, I've always got some irritation in my throat, there's always something I can't swallow. I find my chest is always tensed and tight, especially when I lay down and I find myself catching myself and having to relax.. I no longer breathe deeply, it's just very shallow breathing and when I do sit up still and relax my shoulders and take a good big deep long breath, I cough my guts out, it almost hurts while it tickles to breathe that deep.

&#x200B;

I'm only in my 30s, been smoking since I was about 19 or 20, but I grew up in a second hand smoke box that was my childhood apartment, so I've probably got more like 30 years of smoking under my belt. I wonder if breathing difficulties aren't some of the root causes of numerous other life problems I've faced, like sleeping. If you aren't breahting properly, you aren't going to sleep properly, and surely if that's the case from the day you come home from the hospital as in infant, SURELY that must have some horrific cascading effect on development, right? I'm no doctor, perhaps a bit of a pseudoscientist, but it sounds quite logical to me.

that's why smokers get indigestion frequently, because they are in need of constant supply of nicotine to digst and when that supply is slightly more than they smoked they'd get indigestion. 

and that's why quitters experience indigestion when they quit that may last up to 4 weeks and becomes brutal at the third.

10 days smoke-free after mutiple years of smoking half a pack a day > had a relapse 4 days ago > now been 4 days smoke-free again.

The thing is - on my relapse, I smoked 3 cigarettes, after which I started to get intense heart palpitations. I've still got them, and quite a shortness of breath, too. It really scares me and therefore increases my anxiety about my heart welness - which makes it hard for me to determine if this is majorly just the anxiety or there's really something wrong with my heart beating so weirdly. My job is pretty dynamic but I'm not sure if there's anything out of the usual that could contribute to the heart palpitations. 

Before my last relapse, I did experience shortness of breath and really felt how my lungs cleared up. At day 10, I went from coughing and stuffy feeling lungs to feeling better again. The weird thing is that these heart palpitations seem so intense, hadn't experienced anything like this.

My smoking habit is one with more of a modern twist - enter vaping. I stopped using real cigarettes regularly about 6 years ago and used vaping as a cessation. I‚Äôll still buy a pack every now and then and stretch them out over two weeks. I went from smoking maybe 5-8 cigarettes a day to using my little vapor pen all day making me more addicted than before - and making that hand/mouth habit even worse. It‚Äôs also so much easier to hide because you don‚Äôt smell like smoke. My husband also switched to vaping at the same time as well though he did smoke about a pack a day. We‚Äôve been regular users of vape pens ever sense - which by the way is so lame to even think about. 


Anyways - I thought of every excuse not to stop. Mainly that I knew my husband wouldn‚Äôt be quitting with me - I thought how could I quit if he doesn‚Äôt? Then I went to visit my best friend last weekend who is a pack a day smoker. Sitting outside smoking a cigarette with her she asked me if I was still smoking in general or just right now because I was with her. I told her we‚Äôre still using the vape pens but I hadn‚Äôt had a real cigarette in a long time and that I wanted to actually quit using any nicotine products soon. Her response was the wake up call I needed. She said ‚Äúyou‚Äôve been saying that for 6 years so I‚Äôm just going to let you keep saying it‚Äù 


I thought, ‚ÄúHoly shit she‚Äôs right. I have been saying that for years.‚Äù


I proceeded to smoke all weekend with her  and came back home and told my husband that was it for me. That was 6 days ago. The first 2 days I survived on willpower alone and now that all the nicotine is out of my system it‚Äôs a little harder (especially because there‚Äôs still nicotine in the house) but it‚Äôs getting better. Also little to no drinking is happening because that‚Äôs a huge trigger for me. I fight through the cravings during my morning coffee because I love coffee more than nicotine. 


This all seems to have inspired my husband because he says he feels like he can do it now and that once he uses all juice he has for his vape pen that he‚Äôll call it quits too. He‚Äôs already using it way less because I‚Äôm no longer using it and he doesn‚Äôt want to cause me to relapse. 


Anyways I say all this to say if you‚Äôre thinking of quitting then quit - don‚Äôt start vaping! I actually vaped longer than I smoked which is crazy. 


I‚Äôve loved reading y‚Äôall‚Äôs stories about quitting and getting through it and look forward to being able to celebrate major milestones here. Have a great smoke free day everyone!",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9985024929046631}"
