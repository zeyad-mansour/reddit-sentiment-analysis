Over the past couple months I've been struggling to quit nicotine after smoking and vaping for 5 years. I managed to go 18 days without a relapse, and after a moderate slip up have gone another 9 days. I have had moderate anxiety for my whole life but of course quitting is making it much worse. I get these bursts of nausea, chest tightness and sweat at odd intervals throughout the day, sometimes my limbs even twitch. Thanks to my anxiety, I worry I'm ending up with some disease or heart problems or Lord knows what. It's the worst in the evening and it's driven me down to about three hours of sleep at night. Is this somewhat normal after 9 days in? I'm just trying to gauge whether this is my bodies reaction to no nicotine or if I should actually go to a doctor.

As the title suggests, I quit smoking 8-months ago. I'd started when I was 16, and am 21 now. Read Alan Carr's book at 20. 

I'm currently visiting my mom at her place (I used to live here), and I'm feeling burned out. Stressed about my studies, depressed about life, worried for a family that's ready to hurt me whenever, and just really miserable. I've got no answers anymore, and it's been terrifying and hurtful.

These days are somewhat familiar to me. I'm almost nostalgic to them, while simultaneously hating them. I'd treat them with music, a long night walk and the strongest rolling tobacco I could find back when I still lived here. I can imagine the spots I'd like to sit, and smoke a rollie. It seems very comforting right now. I have not had that comfort in a very long time. 

I'm ready to go out and relapse. I feel it will somewhat keep me sane at the moment. But who knows what part of me is speaking there, or here. I just need honest advice right now, and the encouragement to follow it up.

I would like to share a few things I faced and gained when I quit abruptly after smoking for 15 cigarettes on average for the last five years. I would like to hears yours if any and appreciate if it taught me something.

I know 75 days is not a lot but I am sure I have quit it and have not had a single craving since the end of December.

**Benefits :** 

1) Saves a lot of time and money. I started to always have some kind of money and no frequent short breaks which add up to hours each day. 

2) I can sprint longer and I am not huffing and puffing when I take the stairs. I can climb seven flights of stairs and start breathing back normally in two minutes.

3) Stamina has increased and I can do a lot of work. I am literally as energetic as I was in my teenage years. I am 22 years old.

4) No more do the elderly and the children judge you and you can spend time with them. I have a niece who would not play with me if she saw me smoking.

5) No fear of the smell from your clothes, body and stuff. No more nicotine collection on fingernails and nail beds. 

6) No mental stress. I am a student and live in India. Smoking is considered quite a bad habit. It has been a huge burden off me now that I don't fear getting caught by my parents, siblings or professors.

7) I am no more constantly bloated and my cheeks and skin feel less puffier. My eyes are clearer and so is my skin. There is a lot of development in the sexual department. From prolonged erection to better blood flow to the area.

**Health Problems :** 

1) Hot and cold flashes all day and sometimes when trying to sleep. 

2) I had a mild fever for a few days since the fourth day.

3) Extreme cravings caused panic/anxiety attacks. 

4) I wanted to eat a lot when my regular smoking breaks would come.

Heading back to current day I am no longer with her because it was a pretty bad relationship between us both and I have now quit my job because I couldn't put up with the manager that I worked with and I told myself I'm quitting smoking as soon as I leave.

One is for my first original quit date on October 2019. From Oct to Dec 31st I still smoked though once every week or two weeks when I would drink a couple beers or something would stress me out.  I kept that tracker with its original start date because in the past when I would restart my tracker date it was really depressing. I would mess up after having quit for two weeks and lose all that progress, and then I would cave completely. When I decided to keep my tracker with the Oct start date, even though I was having some bumps in the road, it really set in motion a better quit attempt for me overall. I know some people strongly believe in resetting their tracker, but for me this method was working out. Fast forward from Oct 4th to Jan 1st, and I knew with the New Year it was time to start my 2nd tracker with another app. The ""real deal I can't smoke anymore when I'm triggered"" tracker. So it has almost been a month of not smoking on this tracker. 

I had a really stressful work day, and in the past that has been a big trigger for me. For a long time, there was nothing better than coming home, calling a coworker to vent, and sitting on the back deck smoking cigarettes and drinking a few beers.

I used to have a great health care provider where I’d get free nicotine patches. I tried them years ago and relapsed. Recently (1-2 months ago) found some expired old ones in my car. I used them when I was with people who hate smoking and they really worked! Of course it sucked and the potency wasn’t the same but it really helped. I think it just gave me comfort that I had something instead of nothing at all.

So my question is, where can I get some patches after loosing my health care provider that gave them to me for free?

So for the first 3 days I used a vape and it was rough. I was getting way too much nicotine because I was trying to compensate for everything in the cigarette that isn’t in the vape. I’m convinced there’s more than just nicotine in the cigarette that I was addicted to. I was so tweaked from the nicotine rush that I wouldn’t recommend going from cigarette to vape.

I started 21mg patches and that’s when I started my day count. Did 21 days, went to step 2 (14mg) and then after 7 days I’m now on step 3 (7mg).

The patches were a lot more sustainable than the constant rush of vaping. The first 5-6 days were difficult but I wasn’t flipping out on people or engaging in any risky behavior that made it feel mandatory to relapse. I haven’t gained any weight but I have been exercising about an hour each day.

I haven’t noticed any difference when I step down on the patch even though I’m doing an expedited version. 

A lot of my experience in the past 30 days supports Allen Carr’s point that nicotine withdrawal isn’t really that big of a thing. 

I highly recommend both Allen Carr and the patches. I know those contradict each other but it didn’t seem to matter in my case. I was completely unmotivated to quit, didn’t feel the need and the only reason I went for it is because I knew the patches would give me the mental crutch I needed to get started. I’m debating stopping step 3 on February 1st and just going without. I think the rush of smoke going down my lungs was the biggest thing I enjoyed but I’ve drifted away from that pleasure while using the patches for a mental crutch.

I had a bad past with alcohol and tobacco, and I quit cold turkey three years ago. When I got drunk I was mean to everyone around me and had to call it quits when I blacked out and pushed my wife around. That was that November. That January, I took the first week of the year off work and stayed at home and quit smoking cigarettes cold turkey. It was easy then for some reason, I was mentally ready, and the worst I had from it was an unholy case of diarrhea. 

Before I quit my wife had suffered through my addictions for 7 years of our relationship. We never made much then, so I was often with booze and tobacco while we had empty cupboards. It was awful, and lead to fighting understandably. Now I make decent money and we own a home and smoking at the level I did would not be a financial strain like in the past. 

We had a big fight on New Year's Eve, and I felt so angry, and resentful, that I had changed so much but I felt like I kept being told I needed to be even better. I dont even remember what the specific fight was over, it was that petty, but I remember feeling and saying ""Why did I even do all of this, if I still am looking for your approval?"" It was a yelling screaming fight. I left the house, completely enraged, and drove to the local 7-11 and threw some Steel Reserve, my old poison, on the counter and said ""And a pack of Camel Filters."" Then I added ""Forget about the beer"" and pushed it off. I just bought smokes. I smoked them, and I told her the next day. She was patient with me for a week, working with me, telling me to quit that it was easy, I could do it, all of that. However I felt the old addictive patterns begin to form around me. I couldn't openly smoke at the house, and my job is non smoking, so I started hiding, and lying, and being caught again and again leading to gigantic fights and a thousand packs of gum hiding the smell from my employer.

I've risked everything to continue a habit I had broken years ago. I'm still risking it. I made it several days, but I got turned down for a life changing 6 figure job that I'd been working with a recruiter on for the past week and when I got the phone call, I bought and smoked a pack of cigarettes on our credit card. Just to make it even more like old times, we just had to replace our sewer line and have less than $50 available spread across three credit cards. I maxed one to smoke cigarettes. I lied and said I didnt smoke. That was yesterday. Today I went and tried to walk the dog by myself too many times, an obvious attempt to smoke, got caught by wife and now she's weeping and refusing to talk to me. I don't blame her, with all the times I've said that I'll just quit and lied. All the times in the past I've lied about quitting or buying them. Smoking is lying, because I can't smoke at home or at work, which makes my anxiety peak beyond my ability to control and the whole world gets claustrophobic feeling and I want to light up. I'm only happy right now when I am doing the very thing that is jeopardizing my entire life and hurting my loved ones. My long suffering and undeserving wife.

I try and deny myself cravings, while denying that I am smoking, and I've been snapping and yelling at people in my home over petty things and can't focus on anything. It's hard to deal with the cravings when you can't let anyone know you're going through them. Mental turmoil on mental turmoil. All of this manifests in feelings of anger and resentment towards my job, my wife, my entire life, when all anyone wants is to live a smoke free life and that is a reasonable desire. Still, I lash out because I can't keep myself from my addictive behaviors, or stop lying about it, or anything because I just want to please those around me. On top of that, I feel like I'm a coward because I cant own up to my actions and desires and just openly smoke anyway because first, I know its not the direction I want to take my life, and secondly my family won't stand for it and when I do it, it, regardless of the circumstances, becomes a wall shaking fight that is hours long. Afterwards, even if I want to quit, I am so triggered that I don't have the willpower to tell myself no and I buy a pack. Even while smoking it I know that there will be intolerable consequences but I don't feel like I can survive the moment without indulging my craving.

I need to reach deep down in myself and find the strength to say no again, before this simple addiction swallows my life, my family, and my job. I'm so sorry to everyone involved... but I've said that so much, then turned around and smoked, that no one wants to hear or accept that apology. It would be easier to walk off in to the night and never return than fix this mess I've made.

This go round I've been smoking for about 9 years, and I've smoked a lot more heavily than I ever had in the past.  I also have a lot more stress in my life now, so I'm hoping I can stick to it.

Yesterday I smoked a few morning cigarettes, and the last one was around 9am.  Then I just stopped smoking.  I've been having chest pains lately and not sure why, but I'm pretty sure it has to do with my heart.  I did go to the ER and they said my heart and lungs were ok, but the pain has picked back up and I get palpitations at night and have for over a year.  Heart disease runs in my family.  Cancer runs in my family. I have a 10 year old and her dad isn't in the picture - I *need* to live for her.

So I was planning on waiting until my dr appointment next week and asking for chantix or wellbutrin, and tapering down on smoking with the meds.  I had just bought a new pack and had 1 left in the old one.  They are in my trunk with my lighter right now, because I'm scared that if I throw them out, itll create that panic that you feel when you're almost out of cigarettes and itll make me want to smoke even more.

I just really hope I can quit, because I didnt plan it out this time, I smoked a cigarette fully expecting to smoke another one in an hour, then I just didnt.  But I'm scared over my chest pains, the state of my gums, etc, and hopefully that's enough.  I certainly am craving one, I've been smoking like a pack a week.

I know I still have a Vuse around here somewhere, but if I can, I'm gonna try not to use it.  I mean, it's been over 24 hours since I last smoked and it hasn't been as difficult as I imagined, but I've also been busy.

Lessgo! but I have a question.,"I mean I'm pretty sure I know the answer, but I would like to confirm my suspicions.  I woke up this morning, and made some coffee to enjoy (it's my Saturday, so there isn't any kind of stress or anything). I'm on my second cup, and I noticed the cravings were back, and much stronger than normal. Why would coffee trigger a much stronger craving response? My cravings are pretty hardcore right now. I'm deep breathing, and listening to some ambient forest noises and that's helpful, so I'm not about to cave.

another thing I need to mention here is; as with most people, I've associated vaping and drinking, however, I got drunk at my moms house a few days ago, and I easily ignored my cravings then, and i REALLY associated vaping and drinking, so that's why I'm confused right now.

Some back story here that is less relevant, but important enough to mention. I ""quit"" about 4 years ago and for a pretty long time, roughly about 9 or 10 months. what I did was test the waters and see when it becomes safer to drink without experiencing gnarly hardcore cravings. So I stopped drinking for the first few days. and tested out my hypothesis, came to the conclusion that: In about 7 days I was in the clear to be able to  ignore my cravings. This is why I mentioned the Alcohol part of this post and my conclusion is still true.

Usually Alcohol is the strongest trigger over anything else. This is what I'm trying to say. I couldn't articulate this correctly when i posted this. My apologies.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.959829568862915}"

Rather than hitting an apex of flu symptoms, or a psychological obsessiveness - mostly I'm feeling like I'd rather just eat more chilli chocolate (a tangent for a different post). I've been building up the intention since before Christmas, and maybe this week's payday will change my desires some, but right now I'm just mostly hoping it stops being on my mind so much.

My experiences quitting before, and my philosophies around it are complicated. I will be putting the £15 a week from roll-ups into something else. But that's not going to add up as significantly as people who've never smoked like to imply when they're being encouraging. My first time quitting was so horribly ill in the immediate days that I didn't try again for years. Quite a contrast to these last two days.

My biggest worry here is the long term spectre of the habit. I remember my mother quitting entirely for nine months - then taking it up again because she'd been miserable the whole time. Or so she said. I've also never been very good at personal discipline, from long term job hunting goals to weekly homework as a preteen. Probable ADD, but that's up to a doctor to figure out.

I don't really have a question here, as no-one knows if I can stay motivated 'til I get there.

It ""just happened"" over time, through some gradual changes, strokes of luck, and deciding to keep it up *voluntarily*.","A little less than a year ago, maybe 10 months, I switched to vaping for convenience's sake, but not immediately. I went back-n-forth between the vape and actual cigarettes, because, maybe due to the vape I got that wasn't an expensive set-up nor was it dirt cheap, cigarettes still gave a better drag and sensation of smoking. Flat-out. Maybe also because I made a point to not get a vape that produced massive douche-clouds, but this is where I would say the stroke of luck came in. 

Eventually I had half a pack of smokes sitting around for a couple weeks before I gave it away. Sweet! I'm off of stanky-smokes and on to them flavor-clouds! It's still not quitting, and it's still bad for me, however it is leaps and bounds better than traditional cigarettes.

So I'm smoking this vape, and putting in the highest nicotine content liquids shops offer, and I'm puffing on this fucker non-stop. Well, unless I'm somewhere where it's not allowed, aaannndd except when I've been in there a long time and I can justify taking a short drag and holding it a bit longer than usually to cut back on the cloud and smell. Again, douche-clouds. People don't like it, but I still maintain, that because it's a nice smell, and I left no cloud, *fuck em*. 

Next thing I know it's a couple weeks ago. I pick-up a new set of pods(they hold the liquid and heating element and are disposable) and I take a drag and get hit HARD in the lungs by pure fucking fire. Sometimes shit happens, you get a dud, it's rather rare though. But that burn lingered in what felt like the top of my left lung. 

I waited to take another drag, thinking maybe I went too soon and the liquid hadn't soaked into the cotton or whateverthell that stuff is, but nope. Fire again. I trashed that pod and popped in another one, but the damage was done and I now it all felt funny and tasted odd. Did I get *two* pods in a row that were duds? Shit, they only come two in a package! 

Well, that incident lead to a chest-cold, then head-cold, where smoking in general was just fuckin miserable. I tried. But the discomfort and messed-up senses due to being sick overcame my urge and desire to smoke. 

I had started trying to cut back on the vape when I worked out how much I was hitting it, how much liquid I was going through, and how much nicotine that equated too and actually had an existential reaction. Getting sick when I did was perfecting timing because when it became unpleasant to smoke I had already made decent progress at easing-off the vape. 

As of typing this out, currently 4am and awake due to pain, I'm 3 *complete* days without smoking OR vaping. I've had the odd drag here and there up until 3 days ago. This wonderful. I really hope I can keep it up, with a driving job no less! Was a smoker for about 15 years. 

Gradual changes and small efforts add-up! And take that opportunity when it shows itself(like getting sick, being unable to smoke, and continuing to not smoke as you get better)! I shit you not I had literally not even cared to make an effort to quit one year and more ago. That's why I say it *sorta just happened*.

I just turned 18 today and your the present i bought myself, cant wait to hang out with these guys, they are so cool. The manager smokes out there as well, really happy your going to help me find common ground with him.



	• Heya Cigarette, your a pretty cool friend to have around, you have introduced me to so many awesome people and i feel like you have changed my life, people who weren't interested before are now taking the time to talk to me, at first you tasted really bad, but never judge a book by its cover, you make me feel calm and are always around if i get stressed out thanks for being such a great friend.




	• Dear Cigarette, just turned 20 and my folks are on my ass, don't know why they are so concerned with you and me, they don't get it, whenever i go have a drink your there, whenever hang out with friends your there for all those good memories, even in the bad memories your there to make me feel better, i don't know what i would do without you, my brother started smoking a couple of days ago as well, he seems happy too, always having that little companion around.



	• Dear Cigarette, i don't know if you are the best thing for me after all, i felt pretty down today, tried going for a surf and felt pretty out of breath, surely its not you, everyone says its your fault but i haven't been exercising as much, your not the reason right? Maybe you are, nah you cant be, even as i light you up now your reassuring me, that little rush i used to get is gone but i know your making me feel better.


	
	
	• Dear Cigarette, today i screwed up big time, things between me and my girlfriend didn't work out and its all my fault, i feel so ashamed and so alone, only you are here forever faithfully by my side helping me get through this, i honestly don't know how i would get through life without you, your my closest friend, thank you for always being there for me.



	• Dear Cigarette, i honestly don't know where people get off telling others what to do, i'm 23 now and just been told by some chick that i need to choose either you or her, seriously? I told her to piss off, you were there for me through every hardship. Cant believe she would say i am an addict, seriously i stay with you cause your my friend, can stop any time but why would i?......


	• Dear Cigarette, i met another girl today.... She is worried about me as well, she wants me to be happy but asking why i spend so much time with you, she seems different from everyone else, i got pissed with her right away thinking she was trying to separate us....but she wasn't...she wants to understand...i think she really wants to help, i try to be her rock and i think she wants to be mine as well, she's really amazing.


	• Dear Cigarette, i think its time to stop seeing you now, my partner is taking a lot of time to talk to me about how she wants to support me through my downs, i really want to make her happy, wont be seeing you again for some time.


	• Dear Cigarette, you my oldest friend are always there to help, i had a fight with that girl and snuck out to the shops, just like you always have been in the past your here to help me, i was so angry but you calm me down, its been 2 days since i saw you last, i missed you so much. She doesn't want me to see you anymore so i can only see you in secret, need to hide it....it will be our little secret.



	• Dear cigarette, just turned 25 today, i tell myself that my partner doesn't know about you, that i have to live 2 lives is hard but i manage it, i cant believe it though, found out i am going to be a dad, thought i would celebrate with you, find a nice quiet spot to drive and have some one on one time with you, my partner doesn't know i'm spending time with you....she wouldn't understand



	• Heya Cigarette. Its getting really hard to spend time with you and hide it from the family, my partner found out about you after finding a butt out in the garden, i have never seen her so angry she feels hurt an lied to.....we are pregnant with our second son at the ,moment but she is threatening to leave me if i cant stop seeing you...... I don't know what to do...



	• Hi Cigarette, i have tried spending time away from you but its incredibly hard.......im starting to feel trapped by you....why am i itching to spend the next free moment with you....why do i prioritise you over my children....makes no sense......maybe my partner is right....maybe she's not so crazy...

Enough is enough......this is the last time, i am so tired of not being in control of my body, i have come to realise that you ARE the problem....any time i try take a break from you its like you have some magic power over me, i....

You are the worst thing that i have ever known in this world....making you a part of my life when i was 18 was the single most stupid decision i ever made and i have made a lot.... You have taken so much from me....you took my body...you took my health...you took my free-will, you took my money and everything from me.

This post isn't entirely specific towards this sub, but stopping smoking has a lot to do with it. This is just pure venting on how I feel this past week. 

74 days ago, I drank daily, smoked weed daily and nicotine daily. I had been drinking daily for 1 year, smoking weed daily for 5 (with a few days off in that time), and smoking a vape for 5 years. All started in college. I used to moke (tobacco and weed) for a year but quit that. 

Quit alcohol and weed 74 days ago. Still hard, but the cravings are managable. Actually not that hard - I've had maybe 3 bad cravings since NYE, including that night. Other than that, easy as can be. Been a better version of myself actually. 

Quit nicotine 23 days ago, and it has made the biggest difference, both positive and negative by far. Weed was causing me bad anxiety which I knew consciously, even when quitting. Alcohol wasn't doing a ton anymore, was becoming more and more depressed and irritable because of it. Both of these, quitting them, I could stay conscious of their drawbacks. 

These past 23 days have been a nightmare, however. I have been thinking of smoking much more consistantly than either of those, even though nicotine wasn't as fun as alcohol to say the least. It was just the drug that I used the most, I guess, and the high hit the quickest. Weed was the second hardest, but it was actually zero fun. Nicotine was just hurting my wallet, which is less painful. Nicotine was my void, and my favorite. It was like a whippit for me, or how I would imagine it, as I have never done one - like poof, pure dopamine, no worries, and the warm and fuzzies for a second. Of course this was rare (unless moking), but it was a treat sometimes that I miss now. Then again, it was rare, and mostly unfun, but you know what I mean. 

I am afraid that I will relapse in one of these addictions this weekend when I go to a concert, or soon. Afterall, I am only 23, I have a lot of temptation left. 

Yet I feel so good when I feel good now. When I have good hours or days, I feel like im cool, confident, and just so happy. I just don't wanna relapse, I wanna keep going, but with nicotine, sometimes my brain fog gets so bad I forget it all except the hunger. The cravings can last hours too, cause I focus on it. 

I will get through this, this is just where I am currently. I may drink again, cause my anxiety, but I know deep down that it will long term make it worse, but how else can I socialize and pick up a relationship again.

No drink or smokes for 28 days. But tonight he’s going out for a drink (which is fine) but he will likely smoke. 

I can’t help feel disappointed because up until this point he was able to say no to drink but because “the lads from work” wanna go out, he wants to go out and drink too. 

He has no willpower in this. I could smoke one night or have a drink and then not touch it for years and if I wanted to I could have one again. And a one point I forced myself to be a regular smoker for a year - but it was easy to stop.

I can just stop.

I find it so hard to understand why he can’t. 

And that’s why I’m disappointed because up until tonight he made a conscious decision to stop and he was standing by it. 

But now he’s making a conscious decision to smoke. 

At least that’s what it feels like. And because that’s what it feels like it’s hard not to feel disappointed. 
I still want to support him but now I feel like what’s the point? 

He’s literally only going to go x amount of days until he decides to smoke again- and look relapses happen.  

That’s fine, but it’s just the aftermath and that I have to deal with that.

I’m coming up on two years smoke free (after 13 years of a pack a day) and I wanted to share something that made a huge difference for me, in case someone else needed to hear it: One of the reasons quitting was so difficult for me was because for years smoking was my only mode of self-soothing. I had not ever sought treatment for my major depressive disorder or ADHD, and when I had mental obstacles throughout the day, my immediate reaction to every struggle was to smoke. The hardest part of quitting was learning how to recognize when I needed to self-soothe and developing a list of other self-soothing behaviors to turn to. Once I figured that out, I became a true non-smoker. 

If you are similar to me, and have a hard time dealing with distress, agitation, frustration, etc., without reaching for a cigarette — you might consider looking up self-soothing techniques for anxiety. There are hundreds of lists online, and there are techniques that suit everyone. (Some of my go-tos were 4-7-8 breath cycles, giving myself hand massages, yoga or stretching, cross-stitching and, weirdly, mindfully smelling food and flowers.) I typed a list and kept it as the lock screen image on my phone for the first month I quit. It helped me and I hope, if you need it, that might help you!

E: I also got a therapist to deal with my underlying mental stuff. A++ highly recommend if you’re also quitting while dealing with untreated mental stuff ... quitting brought some of that to the surface for me. But even if you don’t have diagnosed mental health struggles, self-soothing techniques are useful for everyone during stressful situations like chemical withdrawal!",37,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9806293845176697}"

I am feeling some weirds 'pains' in my chest like something it's changing i don't know if this is normal. My doctor can't say, he told me i'm healthy and maybe it's another kind of craving. Did somebody felt something like this?

I am 38 years old. I quit smoking on January 1st. This is the second time I quit. The first time was when I got married, I was 29. I quit for 3 years, until my father died. That was the day I started smoking again. I got divorced that same year. I was always kind of a light smoker, but last year (2019) I smoked a pack of 14's, every day. Somedays I went for the 20-pack. I didn't usually smoked in public, so those 14 cigarettes were always at night, alone.

A few days ago I had a homework from the app/program I am following to quit. I was supposed to help 3 people who are trying to quit. I didn't do it. I have been feeling really down.

According to the app, I have gained more than 24 hours that otherwise I would've spent smoking. This has made me realize that my life is very empty. I don't have a partner or kids, and besides my work and my family, I feel like I have little else. I don't get cravings anymore. I just feel... emptiness.

I know this is an opportunity for me to design a new lifestyle. It's just been hard.

Anyways, quitting smoking by itself has made me feel like Superman at times. Specially when I excercise. The first 2 weeks, even though were the hardest, were also the ones that I undoubtedly felt incredibly better, day after day. It's just that the hype is kind of passing already.

I guess what I'm trying to say is, if you want to quit smoking, make sure you have a list of hobbies or activities at hand. I think, at this point, this is my hardest challenge.

So... What did I do to quit succesfully?

\-Moved out

\-Quit drinking and avoided friends and social gatherings for 2 weeks

\-Followed 2 programs from paid apps (SmokeFree and QuitSmoking)

\-Used Nicotine Replacement Therapy (Gum)

\-Signed up to a gym 2 months prior

\-Made a support group of people who I consider succesful and happy who have never smoked in their life

\-Studied about Habits and Pleasure.

Yesterday in the afternoon I was watching my non smoker partner go home for the week, and while I was watching her leave with a cigarette hanging out of my mouth, I sort of just said to myself : let's see how long I can go without lighting another one up. When I was a kid I've been diagnosed with a ""weaker lungs performance"" (I don't know how else to put it in English), and ever since I started smoking, the doctors kept telling me that I should really consider quitting. I'll turn 26 in a few months, I've been smoking since I was 19. So basically, that's 7 years for me. Besides all that, I'm moving into my new apartment in a few months, and I definitely don't want to smoke in there. Further more, I'd rather invest my money into savings accounts or to renovate my apartment, instead of burning it up on packs of smokes... That being said, I'm pretty positive I have more than enough reasons to quit. I actually quit once, a few years back. I was a non smoker for roughly 2 months, and honestly I can't remember how or why I collapsed right back into it. I guess I'm sort of familiar with the nicotine cravings and all the shit that I'll have to deal with for the next couple of days, weeks,... at my first attempt of quitting, I still remember day 3 and 4 being the absolute worst. It was a nightmare. I really want to quit for good this time, but I feel when those days come creeping in, I'll collapse once again.

Anyone here who's just quit recently ? What's your coping mechanism ? I want to know what was the moment that really made you quit for good.

Its incredible. It was yesterday when I was venting as I took a breath to inhale the cold air from outside. I was so amazed about how good the air smelt. It does give you this special kind of feeling in your gut of chilhood, love, nature, euphoria, accomplishment and pride. Pride about not harming you precious body anymore.

I also taske a lot better. I used to salt my food pretty heavily, now I realized why: I wasnt able to taste anything because of the smoking. I love cooking and its so good so really be able to taste my food.

&#x200B;

**Breathing**

I stopped on the first of January, right after New Years Eve and instantly catched a cold. I finally start to feel better after being sick for over 3 weeks and so does my breathing improve. I had really bad wheezing which now slowly gets better. Its not so long since I quit but I already look nostalgicly back to the horrible nights after I came back from partying to lay down in my bed only to breath like a vacuum cleaner. I remember the first times this happend as I thought I was going to die. Its weird to say that i got used to it. Laying there like a dying fish without water. Breathing so slowly, so concentrated not to panic. It sounded like i had already throat cancer. Incredible I didnt stopped right there. I just kept smoking.

&#x200B;

**Depression**

As stupid as it sounds part of the reason I smoked was to escape bad feelings. It's so simple to just light up a cigarette and feel relief. I read about (on this sub/articles/yt videos) that smoking actually causes (to a certain degree) depression. I do a lot of things to feel better, smoking was definitely an important habbit to stop. There comes a lot of pride and confidence with quitting smoking. **it causes a lot of mental pain while not being able to stop a self harming activity.** Not being powerless and hurting myself gives me a long lost peace of mind.

&#x200B;

**Stinking**

You take a shower, brush your teeth, use some deo and then smoke a cig to fuck everything up again. kind of lunatic. Nobody wants to smell like smoke. its ridiculous. As an ex smoker i still kind of feel some nostalgia by smelling smoke but i guess others dont and it feels good to smell like a normal cultivated person. Also I usually try to make a good impression and I guess girls dont mind a good-smelling person as well.

&#x200B;

**Endurance/Fitness/Sport/Exercise**

Im looking forward to finally be able to go to the gym again. Also im so excited to incorporate running into my workout regime. Im excited to improve my endurance, spend more time in nature, do running as kind of a meditative habbit to take time for myself, reflect and process thoughts. Also to push myself and experience achievements.

&#x200B;

**Energy levels**

Are imporved aswell, I guess. Like my body should be able to transport more oxygen through my body because my blood cells arent clogged with tar and shit. So i should have a more steady energy level throughout the day which I guess is the case. Also my sleep is better but all of this needs more time for me to actually be sure about it. All I know is that I get pretty tired right now and i really want to go to bed.

all in all I feel really great. Im proud for achieving my victory over this extremely addictive drug. My health is improving as I can breath better and my mind is happy aswell to not being a slave to my bad habbit anymore. I wish everyone of you a great week.

&#x200B;

(Addendum)

**Calmness**

Not constantly worrying about having to smoke a cigarette again. I can now finally again go to sleep without getting out again 3 times to smoke the ""one last"" cigarette before actually sleeping. not to mention the bad sleep i had while smoking because apperently smoking disturbs your sleep, so you wont sleep as deep aswell as it takes longer to fall asleep.

* Also I can finally just watch a movie without having to get up 3 times because i ""have to"" smoke.
* I can enjoy sitting with my family without having anxiety about having to smoke soon.
* I dont need to smoke before and after lectures

&#x200B;

**Hearthrate**

Feels like my natural Hearthrate has decreased. Im sure you know what I mean by saying that after smoking your hearth beats faster which is if you think about so freaking annoying. Also all in all I feel so much more patient and focused and relaxed and clear minded (**less brainfog** which could be a paragraph by itself but im too tired rn so im now finally going to sleep:) )",42,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.832594096660614}"

I don't know what to say when he's practically begging for permission to smoke. I've told him it makes me uncomfortable when he puts me in that position.

I'm an ex smoker who took to vaping to quit 5 years ago.  I've recently decided it's time to end that as well.  I started about 2 weeks ago.  I was using lozenges and nicorette gum.  That helped with the cravings and kept my irritability to a minimum.  What I wasn't ready for was the bouts of severe depression.  It would come and go in waves.  I've heard people talk about how when they were quitting, they felt a real sense of power.  Not me.  Not this time.  I remember quitting smoking for a month about 20 years ago (I'm 41), and it wasn't any where near this hard.  

Running and meditation did help, but it didn't last.  15 minutes after my run, I would be back to feeling like everything sucked.  I gave in a couple days ago and picked up the vape pen again.  Depression gone, guilt has taken it's place.

There’s still a long way to go but it seems completely manageable now I’ve realised one thing - it truly has gotten easier.

I have about 3 cravings a day now, and most of those are really mild - like just briefly thinking about a cigarette. When I do get a strong craving I remind myself that in an hours time I will have completely forgotten that I wanted a cigarette, and in fact that I actively won’t want one.  And it always comes true - Every. Single. Time.

For me what is hard about a craving is the fear that you will feel that way forever.  That you will always want a cigarette.  I finally realised - that’s your addiction playing desperate games.  In a few minutes the thought of cigarettes will be forgotten and you won’t want one atall.  Picturing myself in an hours time, still smoke free and completely happy, gets me through those couple of dark moments per week.

I'm 19 and I think I can pretty much say I'm keen to be part of the tobacco culture as a casual-rare user, although I'm not sure if I should keep going.

So I had my first step with the tobacco experience a few months ago. To provide you some background of my motivation to try it: \[1\] I watched my grandfather smoke when I was younger (\*even though he often hid from my family and I when he lit up a cig/ btw, he is in his mid-70s and despite him picking up smoking young, as a casual user he seems pretty healthy and has never had complications derived from smoking); \[2\] They seem to be everywhere in movies and TV, and I began to take note of that as my interest to smoke increased. \[3\] After stumbling upon many old 50s/60s cigarette advertisements (because I am a big fan of history), I decided to try one. I owned a cigarette carton from Mevius (A Japanese tobacco brand) I had for collection, and decided to lit it up a few months back, and eventually I finished almost all the carton in about two months. I smoked occasionally 1-2 cigarettes a week, but pressure from my close friends to stop got me to destroy what was left in the Mevius carton and put the pack away. As I write this, I have not smoked a single cigarette since I destroyed my pack (it's been about 3 months), and instead decided to try vaping. I got myself a juul and began to vape as a beginner (just keeping the vapor in my mouth) but eventually I got the hang of it and enjoyed it very much. I vape about every week, always taking a 4-8 day break before I decide to whip out the juul again. I've gone from 5% to 3% to now less than 1% nicotine pods, however, I'm not sure I want to quit vaping or smoking despite my near relatives and friends suggesting it.

I’m a 53 yr old female with beautiful 12 yr old boys and a stressful marriage. I never thought I would be in such a suffocating, my marriage as well as smoking, circumstance. I have smoked off and on my whole life but was also athletic. I enjoyed running and riding. My exercising kept me from smoking on a regular basis, just here and there. I would find relief from my stressful marriage by exercising. I had a trainer, was in top shape up until I got pregnant. Since the boys were born, up to now, I smoke on a regular basis. I AM like THEM now, those guys, they are the real smokers! No offense to anyone, trying to share my mindset. I feel so trapped now! I have all the stresses on my plate every day so I run and smoke. I treat it like my friend, associating with relief & quit time. When I was younger I would always take care of me. I knew what I wanted, how I wanted to treat others and how to be treated. Then one day, it’s like a switch went off and just like that, here I am, feeling so alone, continually making this decision to smoke. I know I have my beautiful boys, most stop when their kids are born. Yet everyday I look myself in the mirror and say you are a coward. I think, why quit, it’s too late anyways, your doomed. You won’t exercise again! Ha! Your lungs are shot! You can’t even go up a flight of stairs. I know! I know the thinking is completely twisted! It’s as if I’m on the outside witnessing this other person making these horrible decisions but I can’t get back over to the other side. The side I was so in sync with 20 yrs ago. The side of me that stopped the bad thinking, the bad behaviors for myself. It’s not about the gum or the patches, it seems to be about myself worth. I really need to connect with that again to walk me back to the path so I can then, get the patch or the gum. I have chantex (sorry if spelled it wrong) but am scared to take it because of the depressive thoughts it can trigger and I’m already vulnerable.
Whew! That’s probably WAY more than most but I need advice, words anything to help me stop the smoking!!! Why I’m not doomed, facts, your own experiences... I need to attach a recovering smoker to my hip to help me get thru it. Ugh! Where did I go wrong?

The downsides are bad nausea with almost every pill (even when taken with meals), and crazy dreams that make me feel tired and unrested the next day. I want to get off them! But am afraid that if I do, I may backslide.

Thanks to my wife who motivated me and gave me that extra push before I leave my home for a METAL CONCERT. 

So yeah I am Metal Head and when I go to the gigs, I usually drink a shit load of alcohol and that leads me to smoke lot of cigarettes. Today was different I had made up my mind and in my heart I knew I needed to clear this hurdle and if I am able to do it I will be able to make my next phase of progress smoothly.

Went to the gig met my family of Metal Heads who were already drunk AF and few hammered, now I started getting offer's from my best buddies for some beer and I firmly ignored with a smile and shared my sober resolution and that I don't want to break my streak. For which they all made fun at first and then when they realized I was not joking around they stopped offering me booze.

A couple of bands finished playing their sets and there was a small break for the next band to set up their rigs and one of my friends call me for a smoke. I accompanied him and he was like dude you want one and I was like NOPE, I told him I stopped drinking ALCOHOL and I have NO urges to SMOKE either. I let him puff his stick while I was chatting with him about my sober life and how it felt good without a smoke or a drink, he cared less and finished his smoke and we went back in the crowd to mosh and head bang for next bands.

Now the show is done I am heading back home, I feel so proud of not having a smoke or a drink all day though out the entire gig which has never happened before in last 15 years. I text my wife and let her know that I cleared this hurdle. She felt so happy and proud of me and now she believes in me more than before. I am so thankful to her and her support in helping me quit my addiction from the day 1.

Finally, I want to extend my thanks to ""r/stopsmoking and r/stopdrinking"" members who inspired me with their stories. I hope my story will help to inspire others in need and I am sorry for this long ass text, which I have never done in my life lol.

More hard battles ahead of me, I now have gained so much power and inspiration with this first and looking forward to win the rest.

38 F here.  Ex heroin addict.  12 years clean and sober!  Hold your applause, I am still a smoker.  

Quit for 3 months once with hypnosis, and the crying never stopped, and I would talk everyone’s ear off about my days smoke-free.  Said fuck it and started smoking worse than ever.  People were annoyed, I was grumpy and sad, and that’s just what happened.   That was about 5 years ago.

Now here I am...down from about 35-40 roll-your-own American Spirits a day to 11-18 a day, plus nicotine gum since Jan 5th.  So when I wait too long between smokes I experience nausea, depression, extreme mental fog, earaches an underwater feeling, crying.  I feel like I’m in purgatory, still smoking, trying to quit, too scared to take the leap just yet, so I’m just obsessed with how many cigarettes I smoke.

Why do I want to quit? Two things: I couldn’t breathe.  Also, my dad quit smoking by chewing the gum and it inspired me.  


I really want to want to quit..I’ve started to add little routines like workouts, delayed gratification, and mindfulness to my smoking.  Any insight, encouragement, or stories shared here will be deeply appreciated.    I am not against spiritual (not religious) advice, also.

It took six months to get up the nerve to ride with them, and when I finally did, I was so slow that I got dropped from the “slow” group. I was ashamed of needing to stop & hack up phlegm that I told them to drop me. So, there I was... abandoned on the side of the highway, dry heaving from the effort it took to keep up with a group of moderately fit (at best) middle aged people. 

I’m still not fast enough for the cycling group, but I went looking on social media for other slow pokes and rode with one for 3 1/2 hours today!

THIS NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE. 

Moreso, I would have been so ashamed to do a 1:1 ride with a stranger if they had to see me coughing the whole time.

     It seemed like a good idea at the time because it appeared as if there weren’t any adverse health affects, it was more convenient, and I could make the easier transition to quitting after I stopped school. 
     Well, long story short I am more addicted to nicotine than I’ve ever been. I am about to enter my second week vape/cigarette free and I can’t help but think that if I had just quit cigarettes instead of switching to vape, then my journey would be a whole lot easier.

Long road to go but NEVER WILL I EVER PURCHASE ANOTHER PACKET OF CIGARETTES


I grew up with my parents smoking inside it was that normal - I swore I’d never chose that path (maybe slightly naive) but I honestly never thought I’d feel the need to pick one up. 


But then it opened a whole new level of buzz to the tipsy ness I felt from wine - and within a month I was funding my own new “social” habit


From then I was hooked.  30g park drive menthol was my choice of poison for the next 6 years


I was a daily smoker who hid it so well her colleagues of 3 years still to this day did not know I was a smoker


There’s something about having a secret daily habit that makes the relief of a cigarette after a 8 hour day TRIPLE.


Then one day - the shop didn’t have park drive so my partner thought it would be okay to buy me Holiday menthol - that was the beginning of the end


The difference in flavour made finishing the pouch hard work (first time ever struggling to finish a smoke)


Few days later - the price was increased by roughly $10!!! No longer did the relief I felt after a smoke, warrant $70 a week on cigarettes. I told myself that was it. I REFUSE to buy another packet at that price

My confidence in my 6-hours-from-now self is low, especially since I've quit several times this past year, usually lasting 1/2 - 1 day.

So let me game plan this out real quick:

1. Get rid of smokes
2. Put mental focus into why I want to quit and the absurdness of smoking (allen carr audiobook)
3. Delay responding to any cravings and note their dissipation.  Use walks as a distraction

After many many times of trying to quit the last six months, this evening after a long day at work I had a thought that I don't want to carry on with this habit.

I am 31 years old. I have been smoking for the last 15 years. I had two big breaks of smoking. But after a year or two I relapsed.

I was always trying to find excuses to continue smoking. That I will get fat, that I will be the only one with my friends who is not smoking. That I will be miserable.

The truth is that I can check my diet. That most of my friends have quit. That I'm pretty miserable now smoking so it can't be worse.

I will save tons of money. I get the minimum wage. This will give me an extra boost to be better financially which I really need and be more outgoing. It sucks to try to save money for packs of cigarettes instead of going to the movies. Or buy some clothes.

Of course there is the health factor not just me but my relatives. Lately I have lost many relatives who used to smoke a lot. One of them has a tumor in her brain and she is only 49 years old. I lost my loved grandfather due to smoking. He was only 62 years old.

My dog has been coughing and sneezing lately and I feel awful about that because I smoke indoors and he is the world to me.

I don't want to have any problems with my gum and teeth.

I want to get back that energy I had. I constantly feel tired and sleepy.

I don't want my house anymore smell like an ashtray.

I think it would be beneficial for my mental health. 

I want to have more chances with women. 😉

And lastly, I don't want any cigarette to have any control of my life.

Yes! It will be tough. Yes! I will have withdrawal symptoms. Yes! I will feel sleepy for few days. Yes! I will be cranky. But in the end of the day it will be worth it.

This is a beginning of a very rough journey. Wish me luck and please give me your positive energy.",38,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9563536047935486}"

This strategy might work for people who want to quit or who are maintaining streaks.,"So I always ask my little brother to visit my place every 2 months. In the past when I got the smoking habit I tried all kinds of tactics but nothing worked even after I mentioned this to my parents.

One fine day, my brother called me and said that he would be visiting in 6 days. As an elder brother I never wanted by little brother to get this habit so I didn't want him to know so I literally cleaned my room mopped twice for six days so that he would not get a hint of me smoking. After that I always asked my little brother to visit me every 2 months and He is quite healthy and always hated smoking and knowing this I always advice him to never smoke so every time I lied it was hitting my conscience.

And here I am 4 months have passed without any cigarettes. As for me the thought of my little brother seeing me smoking forces me to cancel my urge of cravings. As people can differentiate between smokers and non-smokers so every time I was thinking about smoking again it always hit me that my brother might know.

2020-01-23 04:14:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/esqmhe/2_days_in/,2 days in,"Hey people, 

I am two days in and wanted to let you know, that the post and comments of the people here are wonderful motivation, and I really appreciate them! The same goes for that app everybody seems to be using here. 

I have a bit of a paradox though. Even though I can already feel that my lungs are getting better and I breathe better. Still, I have the feeling I want to smoke, even though I know its irrational. Even though I have the nicotine replacements. I still want too. 

I was wondering, though. Couldn't I  just be replacing a smoking addiction with a nicotine gum addiction? And if so, would that be bad? I thought I could cut the packages of gums into smaller packages and drop them down every week. Do any of you have experience with this? 

Another problem I would like to ask for some advice for is the following. I used to be addicted to smoking weed/hash. I live in Amsterdam, and dutch people generally smoke THC in combination with tobacco. I replaced this addiction, with an addiction to cigarettes. Even though the cigarettes are worse for your physical health, the weed, if abused, is worse for your mental health, which is more important to me. Last year I had a pretty good try in quitting cigarettes though, but I noticed that I started to smoke more weed again. After that, I released into smoking tobacco. So it appears that my addiction is smoking in general, either weed/hash or tobacco. 

I don't want to quit consuming THC altogether, once every other week with some friends would be fine, because in my eyes this doesn't constitute addiction, like smoking alone every day, like I used to. The only thing I am afraid of is smoking things in general. So would any of you have advice for how I could consume my weed/hash every now and then, without smoking it? I know of vaporizing, but that's a lot of effort in buying al that stuff, same goes for making edibles. I want to do it in a way that is as easy as rolling a joint, but without smoking it. Hopefully, you have some advice, and if not. That's okay. If any of you know a subreddit which would be better suited for this question, that would be great too!

My main point is, this subreddit is great, and all of you are a wonderful motivation into not relapsing again! I'd like to thank each and every one of you for sharing your stories. And to the people who lurk but don't share, you are awesome too! Nonetheless, I would urge you to share because the sense of community in the battle against smoking makes it easier for other people to quit. The more stories I read the more I feel motivated to continue. So if you don't want to share for yourself, you might consider sharing to help other people. I know that I will need the motivation I get from reading your stories, and I am sure other people will need it too. 

Thanks for being awesome and stay strong! We in this together.

The stress of constantly making sure my addiction is fed, my smoking tools are nearby and an economic stress, mixed with the social stigma. It seemed so crazy to me in the moment that the human spirit, something that has allowed others to overcome the pain of death and torture and unending scrutiny, wasn’t present enough in me to throw away a juul.

Just the past couple days I started to tell myself that I need to at least get past 1 craving if I want to really quit and not use the excuse of “well if your going smoke another one after this then what’s this one going to hurt”. 

So yesterday morning I went and got my morning coffee which is always accompanied by a cigarette but decided to just power through it and told myself i can have one on my next craving if I really want. Ended up having a couple that evening but made it through some more cravings too. This morning I have done the same thing and I am seriously thinking this may be an opportunity for me to hit 24 hours for the first time since I started smoking. Didn’t think it was possible but it’s starting to seem like it.

Anybody else gradually cut back or preferred cold turkey? I always thought it would be cold turkey or nothing for me but learning how to fight one craving at a time seems to be the most progress I have ever made so I’m gonna stick with it.

For those on the fence, please quit before it gets too bad. Quitting isnt any easier when you're stressed about health issues. It's not a motivator, it's a trigger. If I'm dying then why stop now right? Makes no difference. I watched a very good friend die that way. He was disabling the alarm and smoking in his hospital bathroom. Nicotine just isn't worth that. 

Foe those struggling, try to find gratitude. You're escaping the nicotine trap and that isnt easy but it's worth it. You're discovering freedom and please try to embrace it. Dont romanticize smoking because it never did anything for you. It only takes.

Since I've been smoking from the age of 13 until now, age 29, and had my first cigarette at 11 years old I feel like I'm almost... losing a part of myself... I feel stupid for writing it, but hey... 
I've been telling myself for... Idk 7 years that this has to fucking stop at some point, but I'm never able to take a stand. Haven't even tried at all really.. I don't even like the taste anymore... Stopped liking it after I turned 20-ish.

I have taken a minor step towards stopping, and that is to stop smoking while I drive my car, which is the hardest time for me. When i got nothing to do or think about I tend to light up while cruising and its so relaxing.
I've done this since January, but I have stopped my car to have a smoke on trips longer then 1,5hours.. My thinking was to start having really negative thoughts about stopping my car just to smoke, standing outside in potential bad weather and transfer those feelings onto smoking itself. 
Sometimes it was as bad as 5 cigg pr hour.. And thats when I realised that this is freaking crazy. 
Also doing this when I'm home. Forcing myself to go outside instead of standing in the doorway. 

To be a little too honest, I have been a heavy marjuana smoker as well for the past 10 years, and I guess that is something that has hold me back considering I have to stop using marjuana if I decide to stop smoking. I don't think I can handle only smoking weed and stop with cigarettes at the same time... Double trouble. 
Quitting this too would do me a whole lot of good, but Im ''not able"" to drink alcoholic bevereges. I just don't like it. 

As I'm writing this I'm ""enjoying"" a smoke and fucking hate myself...

I quit smoking cigarettes quite a few months ago and it was great- I was running 10ks, going to the gym regularly and felt pretty good. A couple of weeks ago, I let some work and general life stresses affect me and I bought a juul online. Since then, I feel like I've been vaping nonstop. When I smoked, I would mainly smoke when I drank which worked out to be smoking once every few weeks (granted, it could be a lot of cigs in one sitting- around half a pack). Now, I am juuling all the time when I'm chilling at home and inhaling way way more nicotine and whatever else than I ever would have before. I tried to run 5k last week and I couldn't, my lungs weren't having it which is pretty sad.

Does anyone have tips on how to stop this madness or any materials that could even startle me into stopping, kind of like Allen Carr's book?

I've been struggling with depression for 3 and a half years now. When it started I had a girlfriend who was really supportive so I was able to live a normal life but she left me 2 and a half years ago. I started smoking at that time which to be honest really helped me cope with depression. I decided to stop multiple times but everytime after a few weeks smoke free I find myself shaking and crying at nights after her. It always ends up with me buying cigarettes again and continuing the habit.

I always felt like I could resist cigarettes. I could resist them when I was drunk, bored or needed a break. The only time I could beg to smoke is when that empty feeling of not having a purpose in life hits me. I have only been smoke free for 21 days now, but I feel like if I find myself crying one more night I just won't be able to resist.

I know this might not be the best place to ask for advice since my problem is rooted in my depression but I feel like smoking strengthens my depression and causes just as many bad things in my life. I want quitting to be the first step towards a happy and healthy mind and soul and I feel like commiting to it would bring meaningful and good things to me like being able to do sports, not being insecure to talk to people because I'm afraid they'd hate how I smell, saving up money to actually do and buy things I enjoy and much more.

It’s ok to feel sad, it’s ok to be upset it’s ok to feel.  You are making a difficult change in your life, if you can do this, imagine what else you are capable of?  One day at a time.  I promise it gets better.  For the first two weeks, I kept gum, Tylenol, and a bottle of water on me at all times.  When I went to bed, I took sleeping pills before the anxiety and restlessness kicked in.  Finally, here is a video I watched countless times link posted below.  I don’t know why it inspired me, but it always did.  Stay strong.  I believe in you.

Since age 18 I've had dozens of quit attempts, ranging from totally unsuccessful (an intention and buying a pack later that day) to semi successful. A couple of those attempts were for several months or more, but addiction has drawn me back in with several different disguises. 

It's time for me to face the facts. Cigarettes are not my friend, not my companion in grief nor a buddy in boredom. Smoking has been my steady coping mechanism but it's time for me to learn how not to rely on it and focus on healthy habits instead. 

I am now 24 hours into not smoking this time. I'm hoping I have the resolve to make this the final time I need to quit.  

I thought that writing my thoughts out here would help me process this and give a sense of accountability. In reading posts here I can see the sense of community and its encouraging to know so many people hold the common goal of quitting smoking.

Approximately 4 months in and I got back together with my ex again when she showed up to the finish line of my first half marathon in a couple years. She wanted what I had, sobriety and a smokefree life. Alas, the relationship went south again fairly fast. I began drinking when we were together about once a week when she passed out from her own boozing. Thanksgiving, I just said FUCK it, let's drink and smoke as I gave up and thought it would lead to us being better. That day prompted me to reevaluate, and I had a sober and smokefree December. January rolled in with an invitation to live with her...i did. January was marked by smoking and several drunk nights. I moved out to a new place this last weekend.

I reset my badges in both subs that help me see a valiant future without these vices...including the girlfriend that could not break her own addictions and couldn't love me at my best. Ugh, I will miss her immensely and have another bout with the first weeks of withdrawals. I'm excited to finish day 1 again, even though I spent the entire day inside doing nothing much. Tomorrow starts the workout routine again and new endeavors to further my life goals.

I knew she was a trigger and when i feel abandoned and unloved, alcohol was the answer...cigarettes were the norm. Thank you community for the support and stories that keep me going. I will keep my head up and be proud of my ongoing smokefree and sober life.

It's the journey of many to relapse, but the determination to stay quit is the test. One day at a time with goals....my next half marathon is less than a month away for this 45-year-old with 25 years of binge drinking and pack-a-day smoking.

I'm looking to move to zero nicotine vape pods (I currently use JUUL w/ 5% Virginia Tobacco pods).  I honestly *hate* nicotine as it makes me feel nauseous/anxious and only started smoking late in life after quitting weed.  Yet I found that I missed the ""lung hurt"" feeling of smoking things (sorry, there may be a better term I'm looking for) so it's more than just an oral fixation and a nicotine patch/medication won't resolve my issues.  I *completely* quit cigarettes this past year and moved to JUUL as the latter delivers that ""lung hurt"" feeling.  Unfortunately, the 3% pods don't give me that feeling and the tobacco flavor sucks.  Note, I don't like non-tobacco flavors but flavor is less important to me than smoke feeling.

So, I'm curious if there's nicotine-free juice/pods for JUUL and/or Caliburn that both (a) gives the same hit to the lungs like nicotine-infused vaping/cigs/weed and (b) has a passable tobacco flavor.

Here is my share, it is a little personal. I hope this helps someone put that smoke down tonight if you are tempted. I am just shy of day 19 of being a non smoker. 😁","
1) having someone to talk to 24/7. My coach is unusual, and I have access 24/7.  
This is a real comfort when I don’t have access to a friend and do not have any family support system.

2)  cinnamon chewing gum has filled a void like I never thought it could.  I did not know this, but it is proven that cinnamon fills a void and helps curb cravings.  

3) post-its around my home, computer, work space and car.  These constantly remind me of my mission to quit, my reasons to be smoke free and serve as reminders wherever I look. 

4) not drinking alcohol.  No explanation needed.  

5) keeping company of non smokers while I am learning to abstain. This is temporary and some of my dearest friends smoke.  I will never judge them for their choices and wouldn’t trade their friendship for anything. 

6) deep breathing.  It only takes a few minutes and changes your outlook when temptation strikes.  It helps eliminate the “oh screw it mindset”, while the craving dissipates. 

7) reading Reddit’s blog and learning that I am not the only one in my head who is experiencing this struggle, all the while recognizing that smoking is not the answer to anything I want to justify as a reason to have another puff. 

8) repeating my commitment over and over again, “not another puff, no matter what”....

9) wearing my Fitbit and achieving and surpassing a steps goal instead of smoking. This is helping me lost the last 10 lbs I need to lose and changes my mindset in the moment. 

10) squats.  No smoking is proving to get me a better booty.  And it’s working.  Wanna see?  😄

11) lastly and most personal, I just don’t want to give up on myself like many others have.  From family to friends, I want to love myself better than a cigarette.  I’ve had a lifetime of a toxic relationship with smokes and just like some other relationships, I am ridding myself of toxicity in 2020.

Yesterday I caved after my first 4 days of quitting cigarettes. I have been a smoker for 10 years, the first ciggie when I was 14 and I am now 25. I have made attempts to quit in the past, but this was my first cold turkey and I really think that is the way to do it. Generally smoked about 10 per day for the last year (use to be much worse), aside from when I'm out with friends at which point I may chain-smoke (say, once a week).

I want to talk about the reason I caved and see if anyone has any advice for me. I broke the rule of one minute, hour, day at a time, and kept thinking about how I will still be struggling in a month or so. Really, the withdrawal wasn't that difficult for me. I could have just continued to isolate myself (all my friends smoke) and also my first 36 hours were during air travel transit from Europe so I think that made it easier to resist the urge. Maybe my feelings of jet lag were muddled with withdrawal to make things worse, or better, I'm not sure.

The reason I caved was that I decided this wasn't the right time (like I'm the first to ever come up with that haha). I am starting a new role this week as a disability support worker, and in just over a month I will be starting the most competitive year of my psychology training (4th year, in Australia it is a bridging year between bachelor and masters/doctorate which determines what course you can do down the line). As it is so competitive, I just couldn't handle the prospect that I might have some hindrance to my performance against the other students.

But now I hate every cigarette I smoke. I hate the way my heart starts to race, my ears get blocked. I think about all the carbon monoxide. In a way, my resolve to quit is just stronger since failing, but I want someone to tell me that in a month, even if I still have the occasional craving, I will probably be able to study and work just as hard as I use to. That my concentration will return before March 2nd (course commencement date). I mean, maybe I would work even better as a non-smoker?

I WILL NOT SMOKE WITH YOU TODAY!

We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!

Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!

I'm pledging myself to not smoking today, no matter what happens - good or bad - and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopsmoking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've not smoked for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still coughing from a three day bender or been not smoked for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a day without cigarettes. For the next 24 hours, let’s not smoke!

This pledge is a statement of intent.

Today we don't set out trying not to smoke, we make a conscious decision not to smoke. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we smoke today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopsmoking, we're not ready to give up.

What this is:

A simple thread where we commit to not smoking tobacco for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopsmoking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

What this isn’t:

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.",13,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9850174784660339}"

I’m a 27 years old that smokes religiously since last year, before that I’ve had some three, four years smoke free, I’ve been a smoker since I was around 15. Now is the time to stop again, I’ve had several attempts last year and nothing worked, at most lasted a day, the addiction feels pretty strong now but I want to break it. I have a pack now, I’ve smoked around four cigarettes since I woke in five hours ago, eventually I’ll smoke the whole pack today as I always do, then tomorrow I want to be completely smoke free, I bought that app I keep seeing around here. Now here comes my weird, stupid question: I’ll completely stop smoking cigarettes, I’m definite on that BUT, I occasionally (couple of days every two months or so) smoke weed, I’d like to continue doing that because of the high, I don’t drink so it’s the only mind altering drug I’m using, do you guys think it’s smart to continue smoking weed? Should I stop that as well? 

Also, if you have any tips for me I’d be happy to hear them, I will go cold turkey and I’ve read that Allen Carr book which I found helpful in making the decision to quit.

I've tried quitting about 15 times so far. 6 times with Nicorette gum, 3 times with the patch, 1 time with nicotine aerosol, 3 times with Champix, 2 serious cold turkey attempts with therapy. I've done many many smaller quitting attempts that maybe last a day or 2 at most. The past 2 years I've made about 6 quitting attempts.

I've tried making lifestyle changes. Gone to therapy. I've read Allen Carr's book. I've tried vaping but didn't like the taste or feel, and it didn't help with withdrawal at all - i still wanted to smoke a cigarette after spending 2 hours vaping. I also tried the IQOS and didn't like the feel of that either. I still don't feel ready to fully let go of cigarettes either. The longest I've been able to be smokefree is 3-4 months at most.

The worst for me is that the withdrawals feel like my blood is boiling, and it lasts several hours. It's a bizarre pain all over the body. 

I think I had the greatest chance to quit with Champix, but after the second and third attempt it lost most of it's effectiveness that I was smoking while taking full dose. Honestly I have no idea what to do at this point - I think I'm slowly accepting that I'm not going to be quitting in this lifetime.

I'm 4 months off of cigarettes and any other form of nicotine now, and it's actually going great! It is currently costing me no effort at all to not start smoking again, even with heavy drinking and nostalgic moments. However, I've been increasingly feeling, wondering: ""Is this it?"", ""Is this everything?""

I mean, sure, I appreciate the not dying when I'm 50 part, but that feels so far away anyway that I feel like it hardly matters. My stamina during running has improved a lot, but not so much that I can suddenly make massive strides. My limbs still hurt after running, I'm still not really getting faster, and running in the first place (albeit slower) was never really an issue anyway with smoking. I like being able to smell more things, but that too is just a minor detail IMHO. My breathing hasn't improved that much, thanks to allergies.

All in all, the benefits feel ""meh"", if that makes sense. Now, I realize that smoking has exactly 0 benefits and that meh > 0. But somehow I thought it would be more awesome. The first month was awesome, now it's just boring. Hell, maybe it'd even be better if I still had to fight to stay sober.

I have used smoking to try and manage my emotions when upset or distressed or stressed. In the past I have used it to try to cope with social situations which is something I struggle with. I sometimes feel low and want to reach out and smoke again. 

So far I have bought a vape to try to quit. It was expensive but it really works quite well and quells the thought of cigarettes. It’s not the cure to it because I am still getting my fix of nicotine but I feel it is healthier than smoking cigs again. So technically I still fall back on the vape and I still depend on it in social situations. I still act the same but am not spending as much and am healthier on the inside.

What changes did you experiment?","Hello everyone! First of all I wanted to say congratulations to everyone who quit, and also to wish strength to those who are struggling...Hang in there!

I'm 23. I started smoking when I was around 15...or maybe 16. I might not remember how old I was when I started smoking, but I do remember my first cigarette very vividly. Back then I was having a very tough time; it was the saddest I'd been all my life. I can't remember what crossed my mind but I stole one of my mom's cigarettes and hid in the bathroom, smoked it and even though I thought it was nasty I finished it anyways. Worst decision of my life, basically.  It took a while for it to become an habit, obviously. To be completely honest I was just a casual smoker and only became truly addicted after finishing high school.

I suffer from very bad anxiety so as you can probably imagine I relied on cigarettes a lot. I officially quit smoking on december 13th from last year after several attempts that didn't last more than one or two days. Before that, I hadn't smoked in an entire week but fell of the wagon after an important test and smoked while waiting for my results. I felt incredibly guilty. That was my last cigarette. Today is january 18th so it's been more than a month since then...and I wanted to ask a few questions-- after sharing my experience, that is, since I think some context is necessary.

So far I've been doing good. I put on weight, which I'm honestly glad about since I'm naturally skinny and I was really underweight due to a combination of anxiety and cigarettes destroying my appetite. For someone who's surrounded by people who smoke and have no plans of quitting - almost all of my friends and my mom - I think I'm handling it very well...especially considering I smoked to handle stress and I felt it was the only way I could truly relax. I don't see myself going back, though.

Something that caught my attention though is the fact I'm breaking out quite a lot. My skin wasn't perfect; I'd have one or two pimples here and there and it didn't look 'radiant' per se... but right now I'm having a lot of pimples along with redness, and it gets dry on some spots- something I'd never experienced before. The only major change in my life was quitting smoking; my diet and pretty much everything else remained the same...so I'm assuming that's what's going on. Did any of you experience this? I thought my skin was going to look better but it seems it doesn't wanna cooperate.

And also, did any of you experience things you weren't expecting after quitting? (In my case, I certainly wasn't expecting to break out like this... I actually thought my skin would look better than ever haha.)

I'd appreciate hearing some of your experiences!

I'll sometimes talk about the future and how much money he'll save on smokes, that he can spend on video games and vacations! When he sees the actual $ amount, he gets excited.

But it affected me in my sports and work. So decided to quit by complete shut off but it didn't work out because I didn't know how our body and mind works. I had multiple streaks of days less than 3 days of no smoking but craving knocked my door and I welcomed like a puppy waiting for food. Then I started knowing things.

Once I read that it takes 21 odd days to pick a habit or change of the mentality and what kind of small and big ways tobacco, nicotine affects I tried to change things. What I did exactly is went home for a vacation, confessed this to my parents and told them to restrict me no matter what for 21 days but I never required them to warn me as I was dedicated and willing to change no matter what. I started exercising and everyday I started reading more about cancer and how it affected many of the people's lives so consciously and subconsciously I was training my mind. Slowly I started seeing changes in a lot of things that I was happy about which encouraged me to appreciate more about myself and increased my hatred for cigarette companies for killing us as they are adding things to cigarettes which makes cigarettes more addictive(source: The Insider).

After this I went back to office's city and completely changed my environment so that nothing reminds me of my old habits in literal words I changed my house and surrounded with people who don't smoke and yes I hangout with my best friends among which many are smokers but in my life I preferred to hangout with non smokers and till this date I am going strong as it's been approximately 6 months. AND JUST TO CONCLUDE IF I CAN DO THIS YOU CAN TOO. Mid fing to all the cigarettes companies.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9764768481254578}"

I was a social smoker when I met my current boyfriend, but after we met the level of dependency just increased with time until I was smoking a pack a day, or more when I was drinking (which was a lot). 

Over the last four years I’ve tried countless times to quit, but if he wasn’t on board as well I inevitably failed and got more and more frustrated. We quit together successfully two times, once for 3 months, once for 10 months. Just this past summer he started smoking again and I tried so hard not to fall back into the same old patterns but eventually I did. I got it into my head that I could only quit if he was quitting with me, so if he didn’t want to I used it as an excuse to keep on smoking. 

Today I am on day 4 with no cigarettes and day 6 no booze. 

My boyfriend is trying to quit as well but everyday so far he’s had a few cigarettes. I’m trying to tell myself that it’s ok, that I don’t need him to quit in order to quit myself. It seems to be working so far, so I’m staying committed. (Not drinking is helping A LOT.)

Anyways that’s been my biggest struggle. I love my boyfriend and friends that smoke so there’s no way to avoid being around smokers. It’s just something I’ll have to deal with.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9641415476799011}"

Definitely have cut way back on the cigarettes since the whole juul wave happened. I was smoking about a pack a day and now I have maybe two cigarettes a week - compounded with my pretty regular juul usage which is about a pod a week. 

The other day I smoked a full American Spirit and I think my body is actually starting to hate nicotine. I didn’t like how jittery I got. So as of now I think I’m done with cigarettes forever and I’d like to ditch the juul soon toon. The only issue is that I really enjoy the act of smoking/vaping. So I was wondering if anyone knew anything about essential oil juice I could put into a vape pen? I’ve tried to do some research online but didn’t really find anything solid about it.

Edit: I realize now essential oils wasn’t the correct term to use. I’m looking for aromatherapy type flavors to vape with little to no nicotine. Lavender, peppermint, eucalyptus etc",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9993854761123657}"

Anyways a week and a day ago, I finally quit vaping. I'm 17 and I smoked since 8th grade. Stupid fucking idea, I know. But I've quit for real now, I'm going completely cold turkey because I just want to be done with it already. Y'all already know those feeling. The cold sweats, the diarrhea, upset stomach, no appetite, the complete draining of your wallet. But, that's not of my concern right now. Ever since I quit, I've been having this feeling like my heart is going really fast, like a hummingbird is in my chest, it's all day every day. It'll stop for a maximum of like 2 minutes, even then I can still feel my heart beat faintly, then it starts back up again. I've gone to the doctors and my heart rate is okay and my blood pressure is a little high (no surprise) if that matters at all. I doubt anyone will see this but I'd appreciate a response, I've been freaked out for a week now. Also, sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this stuff. Thanks ✌🏼

2020-01-15 14:05:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/ep6okt/internal_conflict_shame_and_forgiveness/,"Internal conflict, shame, and forgiveness.","When we smoke, we have an internal conflict raging within. Part of you wants desperately to quit, and part of you wants to just keep on smoking. This is obviously true, or else you wouldn't be here at this sub. You would either quit today and never worry about it again, or you would go ahead and smoke cigarettes until you died.

Instead, you fight. Argue. Bargain. Just one more pack. I'll quit tomorrow. I can't get by without them. My friends won't want to hang out with me anymore. I'll have one after lunch. You try to quit, but after an hour or a day you want a smoke and you're pissed at yourself for it. The constant internal fighting is stressful, and exhausting. You judge yourself and feel ashamed and depressed. And what do you use to cope with stress, shame and depression? Oh right, you use cigarettes.

Maybe this feels familiar to you, so how do we get past this downward spiral and quit smoking forever? For me, it started with forgiveness. Yes, I craved cigarettes. I'd convinced myself that they tasted good, that I looked cool, that I couldn't get through a bad day without them. And while none of these things was true, it didn't make me a bad person. Addiction is truly powerful, and there's no shame in being its victim. I remember thinking about how 18-year old me wasn't thinking about how having a cigarette would become a 25 year habit that would follow me around eventually kill me if I didn't stop. I made a mistake, and that's ok.

So my advice for you is, if you want to quit (and I know you do, that's why you're here, right?), first offer yourself forgiveness and understanding. Open up both sides of yourself so that instead of being in conflict, you can be in harmony. Bring your whole self, open and vulnerable,  into the task of quitting. Now instead of being stressed and angry and depressed, you can be hopeful and eventually excited. Now you don't need cigarettes to manage yourself. You have a craving, it's fine. It will go away. Don't beat yourself up over it.

This all gets easier as you go along until eventually you don't even think about it anymore. Once you get your head on straight about quitting and stop fighting yourself, success is inevitable.

I hope this helps some of you out there. Nobody loved smoking more than I did, but I'm more than two years past now and I see that it was all a lie. Your cigarette habit has enslaved you, and in order to be free, you simply let it go. It'll be fine. I promise.",33,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.991114616394043}"

My new doctors aren't much help and laughed when I said how much I smoked a day, they said it wasn't much and they thought I was going to say 3 packs a day instead. Whether it's a pack or 3 packs, it's still unhealthy.

I decided to buy nicotine patches because I don't feel strong enough to go cold turkey. I just hope I can get through this and not worry about smoking again.

My mom has always been so angry when she found out I was still smoking and she would make me throw the cigs out in front of her. 7 years ago she had a brain hemorrhage and we had to let her go since she was brain dead. I held her hand and told her I'll quit smoking so she shouldn't worry anymore. I have since felt like a worthless piece of crap because I couldn't do that one thing I could for her, but I needed cigarettes to overcome the pain and the chronic depression that made me start smoking in the first place.

Today, I'm just 4 months smoke free, but I'm not going to smoke again. I realized quitting for others instead of myself was the reason to my failure. In my last attempt, I allow myself to smoke as much as I feel like (I have always tried to limit how many I smoke).When I accepted and forgave myself, I could really see that deep down I never enjoyed or needed to smoke. I did that because I wanted to prove how disgusting I was and punish myself for it, somehow it eases my guilt. 

Last year, we moved to a new country and use the opportunity to adopt a vegan diet (because that was an easier thing to change than smoking). As my mind and body was more clear, I started to look at my smoking habit again. I learned that I felt worthless because I didn't love myself, not because I smoked. Smoking doesn't make me a bad person, smoking is just bad for me, and I don't deserve that. I deserve to feel good and to be loved, especially by myself. If I can stop eating meat, stop drinking, quit antidepressants, then I can quit smoking too! (Although it's still toughest one for me)

Even though it took 7 years, I still feel blessed and proud that I did it at 30, as I promised myself. I'd like to think it's my parents in heaven whispering to me every night in my dream that made me see the light. I got the best 30th birthday present: health, love, youth and freedom. For the first time in my life I have enough love to give without sacrificing myself , and I'm here to see what I can to help others find theirs too :) love you all, you're all wonderful and deserve happiness!!

I would smoke 20 to 30 cigs on a night out, maybe more depending on how long its been since I smoked. I would be shattered for a couple of days after and smoke nothing, but after a few more days and couple of drinks the cycle would start all over again.

I am now at a stage where I no longer want it to be part of my life. My priorities and lifestyle has changed and I can't sustain this shit habit much longer. I am married now with a 1 year old boy and my wife is pregnant with our second child. I don't want to be the husband/father who smokes and misses out on precious moments just because I wanted a brief moment of (empty) joy. My biggest challenge is not to smoke when I drink and last night was my first real test. I had a meeting with a social club of mine and didn't touch one cigarette. I am very proud of myself and didn't think I would be able to resist once the first glass of wine went down. But I did, and it's now something to build on.

I'm almost 22 years old, I've been smoking for about 4 years on and off. For the past two years I've probably smoked a pack a day, there were some serious breaks where I vaped but it decreased my lung capacity so much to the point that I'd have to visit the hospital because I couldn't breath (likely actually panic attacks but regardless I through out my vape).

I want to quit so bad but I dont want to supplement my nicotine with alternatives like gum, patch, vaping, etc. But I get so much pleasure out of enjoy a break to have a cigarette, and I think I'm more obsessed with the almost meditative ritual cigarettes afford to me.

I constantly have anxiety about my smoking. My doctors all say at my age it shouldn't have had a significant effect on my health but hey I wouldnt be the first to have fucked their health over from smoking for a few years. I'm always checking my neck for lumps, I seem to always check the lymph nodes on the left and right sides of my neck for swelling. I look at my throat almost daily with a light. I always seem to have phlegm or some buildup in my throat that I cant cough up or expel. Lots of my friends smoking the same amount of time or less have couched gross gunk or even black phlegm but I never have, cigarettes dont make me cough and every single one I've smoked is still in my body. My lung capacity is low, or at least my lungs never feel satisfied with the size of the breaths I breath in. My doctor has said my neck looks fine, I had an xray of my lungs when I went in for vaping (I was vaping and smoking at this time) and the doctors said my lungs looked normal. I've asked my doctor to do some spit test a friend told me about for cancer indicators but she denied me because everything she has looked at seems fine and I haven't smoked long enough to cause that kind of serious damage. 

I've tried chewing a shit ton if gum, making a fake cigarette so I could do the ritual without the nicotine (worked for a bit actually). I've identified my triggers and there is no way to eliminate them. I want to quit cold turkey, research suggests this produces the highest amounts of quitters who dont relapse. But I've relapsed probably nearly 100 times by now not even exaggerating. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for me to quit? Is there a ""right time"" to quit?

I may be undergoing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy soon for another issue, but its suggested that only one behavior is focused on during this treatment because the changing conditions can change why you had behaviors and I dont want to screw that up. (This is why I asked if there is a right time)

Has anyone tried cold laser therapy? Are there any tests I should request from my doctor to make sure I'm in good health? Do my health concerns seem overly paranoid or is their merit to my concerns?

On day 19 of the rest of my life as a nonsmoker.

———

Years ago, while a smoker, there was a day when I saw the emptiness I feel as an opportunity to connect with myself. I wanted to learn how to become comfortable with it, to value it so I would place value within it instead of poisonous smoke. But there was a gap between my “knowing” and “doing” (hello, I’m an addicted person) so I kept distracting myself with cigarettes and the routine smoking required of me. 

I’ve been thinking about quitting for good for five years (yep). Starting about two months ago, smoking became less enjoyable. Of course I raged on smoking 4–15 handrollies a day (if I roll ‘em with less tobacco, it’s like I’m quitting amirite?). Despite the fading enjoyment, I was driven by my “nicotine monster”—conniving brat—to continue.

As with nearly all my past quits, I stopped smoking this time around when my body (ever helpful) got incredibly sick. In and out of hospital for six days, lacking consciousness to desire, my body beat the toxicity out of my system like an old dusty rug. Great. Then, on antibiotics, steroids, etc. my resolve for physical health drowned out any cravings. Why not keep this momentum and just quit for good?

Day 18 as a nonsmoker, yesterday, comes around and I’m back at the gym easing into my routine when it hits me—pop! The emptiness. Internal panic sets in, that feeling of fear that electrolyzes my body until I can’t bare to be that close to myself. Usually a perfect time to slink away for a calming smoke. 

The feeling lasted for the rest of the evening/night. When I thought about smoking though, I didn’t cave in. I didn’t want it. I knew the consequences (headache, achy lungs, feeing under oxygenated) would only distract me and/or further validate the fear I felt around the true driver in that moment, the fear of emptiness. It’s an emotion, and like a craving, I knew it would pass so I went to bed early and woke up this morning with more clarity to place self-love in that emptiness, instead of fear.

I think why I believe this quit will stick is because I ran out of patience with self sabotage as I learned how to love myself and accept love for myself. Accepting self love was the hardest and last thing I overcame before deciding to quit and stick with it, and tbh it’s still a daily exercise. But now that I have, I know I can’t go back.

I guess the moral here is that we’re all facing our demons, with or without the smokes.  But without ‘em, I was surprised to find that it’s so much more bearable.

When going through the first week of nicotine withdrawal, which just ended, now on day 8, I was frantically searching for resources on the exact schedule that I would experience withdrawal symptoms. I just wanted to know what was normal and what wasn't/could be other things. Mainly, I just needed to know that the symptoms WOULD PASS. So, here's my personal experience to anyone looking for the same:

Day 1: Intense cravings for nicotine, irritable
Day 2: Extremely fatigued, headaches, dizziness, intense cravings for nicotine, emotional - cry at the drop of a hat
Day 3: Less craving for nicotine but even more fatigued and emotional with headaches - still crying
Day 4-6: Less fatigued, no headaches, fewer cravings, general depression/disinterest in things
Day 7: Moderately depressed, emotional, general withdrawal and disinterest, mild nicotine cravings, mild fatigue and pretty sick of feeling this way
Day 8: Woke up happy, not fatigued and generally feeling back to normal - no depression, no nicotine cravings

So, it does end! By Day 7 I just kept telling myself, it will pass, it will pass. And it did. And it was so worth going through that because now I am nicotine free. According to my Fitbit, my resting heart rate went from 85 to 68. I don't have to constantly be going for nicotine to suppress a craving. I'm saving $5/day, which is $1,800/year. And among other things, now I can feel my feelings without having a crutch to make the uncomfortable ones go away.

Just know, you can absolutely do this - I did not go without nicotine for 10 years and now I don't crave it and don't want it. The symptoms will pass, and likely quicker than you think. Be easy on yourself, it's okay to slack on the chores, take a nap, order food in and be a little glum. Also, chew a ton of gum. This is a temporary condition with a major permanent reward.

Good luck!",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9926584362983704}"

I used to need a cigarette for every tiny bad thing that happened in my life. I lit up when I failed my interview for a job. Whenever I had a fight with someone. Whatever the situation was, I would have the cancer  stick in my hand. 

But, oddly I didn't find the urge to smoke. My mind told me that smoking would relieve the stress and give me an escape. I thought about it. If I let my mind have its way, the next funeral would be mine. 

It doesn't make things better. It makes you think so. And when you light up, you'll start to feel worse after the first drag. It makes things worse. 

To all the people who are on this journey, understand that the escape is not going to make your problems go away. Don't listen to your mind. Just don't take a puff. No  matter what. No matter what.

This sub has so much succes stories and made me finally decide to quit for good!

The only thing that really fkin me up is the impossibility to sleep, it started the moment i did stop smoking. But hopefully it is temporarily.  


Other things i started doing is:

* drinking lot of water / green tea / mineral water
* eating healthy
* walking every day for atleast 30 mins outside in the nature
* saving the money i used to smoke
* gave up alcohol

I already notice some benefits : Like food tastes so much better!, my heartrate is much lower and breathing is easier! Also no stinking cloths anymore. So lets keep this up!!!! Looking forward what the results are in a month from now on!

I am finally smoke free and want to stay one. I´ve been smoking for sixteen years, starting in my early teens. Finally I quit. I had problems breathing when carrying groceries up to my flat or rushing to the subway. Furthermore there was a disgusting taste in my mouth and I couldn´t smell anything anymore.

So I decided to take a course to stop at the Charite Hospital in Berlin. Fortunately it worked. As I was told it is a good way to alter your behavioural patterns and to stay away from situations that used to trigger you to smoke.

Thus I decided to stay away from parties and bars for about a month. It all worked very well. I feel kind of established as a non smoker right now. I could even go to a bar in which there are smokers or be around smoking friends. Luckily most of them are considerate enough to not smoke or at least reduce their consume when I´m around.

Also I felt that adding routines to your day helps. I always had the routines of reading the news and some pages in a book every day. I added sport, practice drawing and practice coding to them. These things make me feel good. In my experience they replace smoking. Especially picking up sport again is really helpful, keeping in mind that in my early 20s I was really into it and training 6 out of 7 days and then suddenly stopping it. This helps a lot.

Additionally I opend up another bank account to save the money not wasted on cigarettes every month on. This morning I transfered the first money onto it and it felt incredible.

I will keep it up, not smoking anymore, even afer such a short period of time feels amazing. I am more concentrated, more relaxed, feel fit and can enjoy food more!",28,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.997829258441925}"

I know you adsorb nicotine through the skin but all info i found was about green leafs, we only work with the dried leafs (black tobacco) after they are shredded.

We can´t quit or change work right now for money reasons, so my question is do the dried tobacco transfer less nicotine to the skin compared to green leaves or are the same?

Hello, this is Lenny who has been smoking for 20 years. Every year I thought I should quit smoking, but I was addicted to more cigarettes every year. 

It was difficult for me to quit smoking right away because I was too stressed, but I thought that I should reduce smoking habitually, not when I was stressed out a lot.

So, I made an app for me. If you are like me, I introduce you. I smoke HNB cigarettes and have a Bluetooth connection, but you can ignore it and press the plus button to record your smoking.

Thank you !

In order to eventually quit nicotine, those first few rough days/weeks of not having nicotine MUST come sooner or later. Theres no avoiding it - UNLESS you are accepting the fact that you will be smoking for the rest of your life.

By saying ""I'll quit one day"" you are simply prolonging the inevitable, and all the sudden you're 75 years old and still giving yourself the same excuse. But no, that would never be you!! You'd quit waaaaay before then ..right..? I promise you that once you make it through the quote-on-quote ""rough"" patch, you'll be KICKING yourself for not doing it earlier. In all reality, without your brain unconsciously making a bigger deal out of it than it really is, quitting is just not. that. bad. Yeah, it does suck, but you are not in ANY physical danger or under life threatening circumstances (you're actually saving your life). Again - there is no avoiding it, there is only prolonging it. Do yourself a favor, and start that process NOW.

P.s. Stop waiting for ""the right time"" to quit (A.k.a. when things are not so stressful, chaotic, unsatisfactory, etc.)
That 'Goldilocks' quitting time period will never come - and even if it theoretically did come, you wouldn't want to ruin it with the anxiety of quitting an addiction. In my opinion, the Goldilocks stress-free period come after a few days of having no nicotine - once you realize you are not reliant on a chemical anymore.",36,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9961220622062683}"

- compulsively check my Smoke Free app (it’s a good obsession right now).

I have been extremely active in this group. Whether it’s writing a comment to someone 3 days behind me or 2 years ahead of me. Every single time I’ve clicked or commented on someone’s words, it solidifies my own resolve to stay off cigarettes. I now feel accountable, and if I’m encouraging someone else then I sure as hell can’t fall off the wagon. It’s often said that “the best way to learn something is to teach it to others”. This forum shows that “the best way to believe it for yourself is to encourage others to do the same”.

This forum is an insane amount of help. The vibes, positivity, encouragement and understanding that people offer is incredible. I truly feel a different level of support towards one another than I ever had during previous quit attempts that I mustered through solo without joining a forum.

If you’re having a craving, use that 5-10 minutes to scroll through this thread and write encouraging comments. It does wonders for yourself and others.

I tried cold turkey and would go 1-2 weeks before breaking down and buying two packs and lighting up the moment I left the gas station doors. Then I tried vaping for about 4 months, hoping it would wean me off cigarettes. By September 2019 I realized I was running out of time to make a positive change for myself and my family. I threw out the vape pen and liquids, and haven't had any nicotine since. Occasionally, I see a movie or tv show with a smooth chap taking a drag and I remember the feeling, but it doesn't effect me the way it used to. Even walking past someone smoking and smelling it doesnt drive me crazy. I'm proud of myself for making good on my promise to myself.

In the first hour of waking up, I knew this day was going to be a tough one. I avoided every geo-tagged trigger on the way to work. Apparently, my sub-conscious mind thinks I am a disk jockey at a popular club in Tokyo. I walked into the club and strangely bumped into some old aquaintances, smoking by the bar. These people have never smoked in their life, but it felt like they were smoking just to tease me. I guarded myself from the surging desire to smoke by organizing my playlist, until I saw my ex-girlfriend walk through the door. She walk towards me, and not recognizing my bearded face, she asked me for a lighter to help with her cigarette. And just like that I found myself smoking my first cigarette in 10 days. In a few hours of catching up with her, dancing with my friends, I had smoked half a pack. I tore myself away from the crowd on the dance floor, to step outside and call my wife up. I was both disappointed in myself and scared. But just then, my phone's alarm starts ringing. And I wake up. I am in my Tokyo home, but sure as daylight, I'm not a DJ.

All of this was just a bad dream. It took me a long minute to process what had happened, and the fact that I am still a proud non-smoker.

I've done a great job of quitting smoking cold turkey, and since New Year's I've cut out alcohol as well. Generally I feel better, clearer, happier, healthier. I've started eating better, sleeping better, caring more. Started a very basic running program. I've been flying through tasks and projects at work!

Overall I'm already aware of the changes for the better that I'm experiencing. But when I finally left work this afternoon my automatic gut instinct was to pick up a 6 pack of white claws and a pack of menthols. I didn't! But it was the strongest craving I've had since before Christmas and it took a lot of willpower and distracting myself to get home without stopping.

Anyways, I opened up SmokeFree and looked at some old missions and thought I'd do a few to get myself back on track instead of in my head. Brought me back here :) Hoping tomorrow is stress and craving free!

""Hi, I'm new to Reddit. I've signed up just to join this community.


I'm on 30 days, also, and I'm feeling great, relatively speaking. My chest is still sore, here and there and there is still plenty of mucous coming out of my lungs but mostly - I'm feeling like a new person. 

I've never really had an intense craving in the past 30 days. In fact, I get slight pangs when I'm looking at my app or lurking on here. It's kind of odd. 

I've drank 4 times since my quit, and I had a pretty bad craving for a cigarette when I got drunk the first time, at around day five. I have to say, I thought it would have been much worse. Thankfully, it wasn't! 
Last night, I was buying beer and it didn't even enter my mind that I'd usually be buying a pack of cigarettes along with a box of beer until I was back home and then I realised that I haven't had a passing thought about smoking in about 6 hours -- which totally blew my mind!! 

The one thing I'd say is; I get this dreaded feeling that I will never smoke again. It feels so final or something. I feel like I'm in between being a smoker and a non-smoker. I cannot wait for the day where smoking feels as alien to me as being smoke free feels now, if that makes sense. 

I've really got a good feeling about this quit, though. I'm not having nightmares where I start smoking in my dreams. I don't have pangs when I see other people smoking - I pity them. I don't romanticise cigarettes or certain situations where I'll potentially enjoy a cigarette. I've came through alcohol triggers with flying colours and I've joined Reddit to give and receive support for quitters and would be quitters like me. 

I know it's been mostly plain sailing for the first 30 but I know that I am an addict and that I need to stay vigilant at all times. I'm not saying I should let this battle for addiction rule over me for the rest of my life but you wouldn't cross a road without looking both ways, would you? Anyway, here's to another 30 to the OP and me and anyone else who quit. Its good to be a quitter.""",225,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9028573036193848}"

I changed jobs and I'm not happy, I quit my shit job which was my security blanket and entered the world of corrections.

I understand I'm working with people at their lowest and suffering troubles but they can also be very unpleasant people.

Have a vape but it dries my mouth out and hurts my gums and face from hauling on it so I'm dropping that too. Plus I want to be nicotine free.

What got me through the first 7? Winning the mental gymmastics through awareness.

Cravings and triggers make me explore thoughts like:
-Eventually I will have 1 smoke in the future this isn't forever, maybe this weekend, might as well buy a pack right now then.
-Ill smoke a little bit but I will hide it from everyone so no one thinks I failed let's get a pack
-I deserve a smoke x y z happened and x y z is just such a unique stress / pleasure

When I have these thoughts I :
 1) FUCKING NOTICE THEM for what they are

 2) Tell myself that nicotine created those thoughts, 

 3) Take a deep healing breath of blue light into my diamond armor aura (you can skip this step because its autistic)

Every craving thought is mental gymmastics and the mental gymmastics can get fancy as fuck that's the key thing to be aware of.

Your thoughts will create the most elaborate, perfect excuses for why you can smoke because your brain IS you and KNOWS what you need to feel or think to justify a cancer stick. Nicotine hacks in to your brain and becomes an architect of addiction.

But once you can notice and identify these mental-gymmastic, nicotine architect thoughts you know the entire thought is bullshit. Because nicotine created it and nicotine is a fucking filthy, sadistic, psychopathic liar that wants your money and your health.

Now if you can get good at remembering this when you have cravings then you're motherfucking Neo and you're red-pilled. You know the red-dress girl nicotine is trying to sell you as real is bullshit- metaphorically speaking.

So that means.

-YOU DONT LOVE SMOKING nicotine lied to you (so many people say that shit on this subreddit)
-A dart and a beer on a summers day at the cottage is not actually enjoyable
-Smoking is not cool its dirty
-smoke and a coffee is not that great of a combo
-smoke after a joint is actually gross
-smoking after a heavy meal is not satisfying 

Whatever the fuck else you positively associate with smoking... we all have our own red dress girls it's the nicotine matrix that the nicotine architect built in your mind. Once you know you know forever.

Bad news though. That nicotine architect owns a lot of real estate in your brain I've smoked for 10 years and I can only imagine what it's like for a 20 or 30 year smoker. Nicotine owns real physical switches in your body and your brain and he will use them to torture you and make you suffer. Remember nicotine can ONLY influence you, scare you, hurt you, seduce you into smoking it cant force you to do anything. 

If you smoke then I hope the first thing you remember after that first puff is that the nicotine matrix won, you played yourself and you're happy being a blue pill eating cog ruled by your evil chemical overlord.",22,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9903196096420288}"

Not even one.

I smoked for about 30 years starting when I was 15-16. A few half hearted quits over the first 15-20 years before just accepting that I was probably going to die a smoker. When I quit I was smoking about 15-20 cigarettes/day and that was my heaviest but only because I absolutely refused to be a pack-a-day smoker and also because my employer was a smoke-free environment so I went 8.5 hours/day  M-F without a cigarette. I wanted to quit but I really had no idea how to quit anymore. 

I found the free Smoke Free app to be VERY helpful. I think I went ahead and paid $4.99 for it eventually, like 3-4 weeks in, but that was cheaper than a pack of my cigarettes so obviously it paid for itself immediately. 

I also used a nicotine free vape pen that tasted tobacco-like. I had a routine of going out on my porch to play on my tablet and smoke so this helped me to mimic that routine. 

I visited this subreddit a lot and found it to be a great resource both for inspiration from the success stories and also for words of support when the cravings were strong. 

I did all the missions in the Smoke Free app and one of them was about having mantras at the ready for when you need them, because need them you will. My previous quits usually failed because I thought I could have “just one”. That always grew into “just smoking other people’s cigarettes, if I’m not buying them I’m not really smoking again “, which would inevitably just end up with me full-on smoking again. My favorite mantras were the ones that emphasized that I COULD NOT HAVE JUST ONE. I kept them in a note on my phone and thought I would share them with you:

Be strong. Don't smoke. Not even one. Especially not one.

One is too many. One hundred is not enough 

I'm a puff away from a pack a day

A cigarette is like a potato chip - I can never have just one.

The craving WILL pass... whether you smoke or not.

It's not easy, but it's worth it.

This too shall pass.

I don't smoke, because I don't smoke.

One Day at a Time (ODAT).

Every cigarette is hurting you.

If they can do it, I can do it.

Smoking is NOT an option

I will feel like a failure if I bust this quit. 

Act like it's a matter of life and death. Because in the end it is.

The pain is temporary - The gain is permanent

I did supplement the first couple days with SNUS every so often (maybe 1-2 a day) but only had one on Sunday and then one late in the day Monday for maybe 3 minutes and decided I didn't want it and now have not had any form of Nicotine or Tobacco since then. 

Monday and yesterday I felt extremely anxious and had that ""butterfly"" feeling in my stomach almost constantly. Yesterday afternoon that seemed to go away and I almost felt relaxed. I feel like it was almost a perfectly executed (all be it unintentional) wean off with the SNUS and that may have helped reduce some of the withdrawal issues. 

As of right now the worst thing i am currently dealing with is terrible terrible nights of sleep. The last 2-3 nights I haven't been able to fall asleep and then wake up several times throughout the night over and over again but I'm hoping that will subside soon. 

I've never been this serious about quitting and never had this much momentum nor do I think I have ever even made it this far. I feel great and I'm not giving up now. I imagine I have to be about through the worst of it.

Thanks for the support!

So I am female, I'm 28 and have been smoking since the age of 16. Between the ages of 16 and 24 smoking for me was more social and less of NEED more just a want and could happily enough go with out when needed. At 24 my dad (who I'm very close to) was in a horrible accident and lost his right leg, obviously this sucked and was traumatic. Since that time I have been a major support system for both my parents and have also flipped my career on its head moving away from before death care (palliative) and moving into emergency medicine, I am now an educator and training to become a qualified EMT. Prior to all of this I gave birth to my one and only child at 18, his father jumped ship and very suddenly moved to another country and has not been in contact since. So given some of this background and my (very well managed) bi polar I have used addiction to cigarettes as a crutch in stressful and emotional times which has lead to the past four years developing a fairly major addiction (if I am honest about a pack a day). 

Out side of work I have spent time increasing fitness for the past year, losing 30kilos. I notice that I cant seem to progress past a certain point of fitness and strength and am assuming that is because of my smoking. I have also recently taken up surfing (I'm a grommet haha) with my partner and son (both 100x better at it than me). I'm hoping that once I quit I will be able to progress my fitness and strength, and live a more free lifestyle that isnt dictated by my addiction.

After that, maybe once a month, when I was really drunk, I would have a little cigarette as a snack. It wasn't a big deal. I never even really thought about it and never had more than one. It was more of a ""it's 2am, let's go outside and have a smoke and a chat and then I'm out,"" and then I would feel like shit and walk home like ""dang why'd I do that.""

During the past 6 months, however, cigarettes slowly creeped back into my life, leading to a full-blow relapse over two weeks ago. It started with multiple cigarettes while really drunk, to casual sober cigarettes with smoker friends, to buying a pack of cigs if I knew I would be out drinking all night, to just regular smoking by the time Christmas came around.

The biggest event was the death of two friends within a week of each other. They were friends I didn't see much anymore, so while sad, they weren't devastating. But of course, you go to a funeral, and people are nervously smoking, and I'm nervous, you're nervous, we're all nervous and awkward and don't know what to do with our hands. You go to the bar that night with friends who were closer to your old friend, they're drinking like it's the end of the world and it's awkward and your nervous and don't know what to do with your hands and.....

And that's what happens. The funeral was a week before Christmas, and then until the 2nd after that I was on vacation. It took up until Sunday night where I finally called myself out on my ""casual smoking,"" threw the rest of the pack out and went to bed.",22,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9982054233551025}"

I used to smoke a pack a day, for about 4 years. I had tried to quit previously a few times but was never successful. I had long dealt with issues of motivation and procrastination, so I had honestly accepted that I would smoke until I died, and that smoking would likely be the cause. On any given day, smoking occupied about 30% of my mind. I was anxious about when I would have my next smoke. I was anxious that I reeked of cigarettes in class. I was anxious that someone would see me smoking and it would get back to my parents somehow. Above all, I was anxious that I was slowly killing myself, and paying for the privilege to do so with money that I really didn’t have. 

Today, I hardly remember that person. Quitting has been the single best decision that I have made for myself, and still one of my most proud achievements. If you’re reading this only a few days into quitting, you can achieve this as well. I’m confident that you can.

What helped me the most was a change in attitude. I accepted deeply that I would be miserable for a few months before things got any better. I knew that the discomfort I was living in was my cross to bear and that the only way to truly be rid of nicotine in my life was to endure it and trust that life would slowly go back to normal without cigarettes. Thankfully, that was true. 

After about 3 months of enduring the discomfort, I began to notice that I would go an entire day without thinking of cigarettes. That is truly when I began to reap the rewards of quitting. From then on things became easier, and today I truly cannot imagine being a smoker again. I feel so free now that I am not chained to the smoking area of wherever I am. 

I know it feels like having “one last cigarette” is all you need in this moment, but that relief is fleeting. You will crave the next “last cigarette” about 20 minutes later. Be strong and endure what is ahead of you. Pick up your cross and bear it.",37,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9477143287658691}"

I am shocked when I think about how much I used to smoke and how my entire life revolved around smoking. I cannot relate to that person at all.

I LOVED smoking. I'd wake up in the middle of the night and smoke. I'd run home on a break from work and smoke. I'd be late for plans so I could have another smoke.

I wanted to quit so badly and kept failing. I would roll ""butt rollies"" from butts I dug out of the garbage can. I would make up my mind to quit, squeeze dish soap over half a pack of smokes, and then get up early the next morning to run out to the corner store so I could have a cig with my morning coffee.

I hated myself with every drag, I knew I was going to kill myself but I COULD.NOT.STOP.

And then I did. And it was not super fun for the first week, and still not really a blast for a few more weeks, but one month in I went out to a party, hung around with smokers, and I knew I had really done it!

You can do it too! If you are struggling, just know it gets SO MUCH BETTER. If you have quit 200 times, keep quitting! I think it probably took me ten years of half assed attempts before I actually did it. And rest assured, it is the most powerful and amazing thing I have ever done!

They don’t last very long; but sometimes they come on in waves- one after the other for about 25-40 minutes.  They are easy to work through but a serious pain. 
What has worked for me in the beginning (like the first 2 weeks) was drinking a ton of water, eating pretty much anything in sight.  I also repeated my mantras whenever a craving come on.  I cleaned my entire house and washed every piece of fabric in it- this kept me busy and got rid of a lot of the smoke smell.  I also had a stress ball that I would squeeze while I was driving, or bored, or whenever.  Breathing exercises definitely helped.  Just bracing myself for the cravings helped- I knew they were going to happen, so I just had to deal with them.  
Recently (day 15 to now) I have been repeating my mantras; doing breathing exercises.  Still eating but consciously making an effort to eat better/less.  Also, when the cravings come on I just think them through and relax- I think to myself “what am I doing right now that is making me want a cig?” Driving? Finished eating? Talking on the phone?  I think to myself how great it’s been being smoke free for 25 days.  How much money I have saved and what I am going to do w it.

The first 3 days were tough, but I’ve been getting by with only mild cravings.  I know I am not going to smoke, so these cravings go away pretty quickly.

Today however, my brain found a twisted loophole to torture me with.  I’m not a huge worrier, but I do get the occasional “doom and gloom” intrusive thought.  Today I didn’t hear from my fiancé for two hours after she had been walking in a kind of dangerous area.  I had a little “what if something happened?” moment, and normally that would be the end of it.  Well, I think that subconsciously, part of my answer to that question was that I would cave, and I would smoke.

I think my nicotine monster then found the only way so far that he could win.  For the next hour I was extremely anxious, worrying about my fiancé, wondering what I would do without her, and yes, craving like crazy..

I’m good now.  This just really surprised me.  My answer to my cravings so far has been “No, never, not one puff.”  Then when I give one little, “maybe” then the monster sees the weakness and attacks as hard as he can.

Look for situations where multiple triggers are combined for max points: for me it would be: after a meal at a funeral in the rain during a frost in Africa at a poker game after sex, for example. That would be a 7 for the triggers plus 6 for all the combos.

I'm coming up on one year smoke free (January 15th), and you guys helped a lot, and I feel like sharing my experience and tools might help some of you like it helped me.

First off, I visualized the cravings as a ""Nicotine Monster"". So it wasn't me who was having a craving, it was this monster that was hungry. I could then externalize and direct the anger I felt because of the craving to that monster.

This led as well to a weird sadistic feeling as I starved this monster every time he cried for hunger. The cool thing was (most of the time) his hunger hissy fits would last no more than 15 minutes. So all I had to do was get myself pumped to torture that f\*\*ing demon for 15 minutes before he would cower back down and keep quiet. To do that, I created a playlist that would really get me pumped up. Either they are just angry songs to help me drive my anger to starve and suffocate the monster, or the lyrics had a deeper meaning that can be interpreted as a battle against him.

Here are the playlist links if you want :

From there on, my friend introduced me to nicotine and even laughed at me since i had no nicotine in my vape. I wasnt sure but i tried it and then continued as i realized how much i enjoyed the buzz. We would go through extreme lengths to then get the buzz. It would become a morning/night thing. It would eventually come to a point where I just hit the juul just to hit it and not even for a buzz since that would come very rarely. 

From there it had become a habit. I would find myself hitting the juul in public location's, in class, and have the urge when i didn't hit it. Even though i stopped feeling the buzz, i was hooked and i didn't really know it. i would tell myself that i could get off it if i wanted to or that i wasn't really addicted. Its been almost 2 year's now and i have run through many vape devices of 50mg nic from throwing them out into the forest to quit to breaking them in half for my girlfriend who hated me vaping. At that time, the urge had always been too much for me and i found myself regretfully buying another new device. I tried quitting at least 15+ times. Almost recently, i found myself trying to quit but sneaking in cigarettes from my dad who leaves his Marlboro packs around sometime. Then i got onto cigarettes, buying cigarettes, throwing them away because of anger and frustration, and then buying them again. 

I definitely want to quit. I know how many times i have tried Cold Turkey and that doesn't work for me at all. Ive done research as well and its very rare that someone who does cold turkey stops smoking completely. So for me, i started nicotine patches at 21mg and i went for about a week but felt like i was good one day and immediately got back onto vaping. I surrounded myself with smokers and that's why it didn't turn out well. Even on the nicotine patch, i still hit a juul sometimes that fed into my addiction. After the patches, i was back onto another new device and i was on it for about 2 months. Those 2 months have now passed and i ran out of pods New Year's Eve.

So now, My story of quitting begin's again. This time, i am on nicotine patches for 14 mg for two weeks. I am currently on the first day of 14 mg after finishing up the rest of my 21 mg patches. Its been about 5 days and i definitely want to quit. I wanted to share my story with anyone who might also be going through a similar situation. I know that i cave in really easily to my urges and its really tough for me to think straight when i don't have nicotine. I am hoping that i can eventually get my patches down to 7 mg and then finally take them off. I feel like that's where the tough part will start where i have to completely resist my urges. If Anyone has a similar story or would like to share some helpful details that might've help them quit, that will help a lot. Thank you!

My plan is to:

Work out early in the morning and after breakfast put the patch on.

Then At night before i go to sleep, take the patch off so that my brain doesnt always have a constant supply of nicotine.

Currently:

I have been working out consistently but i had kept the patch in during the night time, so that will change today.",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9968473315238953}"

If I see something I want that is more expensive (ie. trainers eg. £30) then I know that I need to wait longer to earn that money to receive the trainers. 

I never really used to spend money on new clothes or anything nice for myself as tobacco and filters were my usual treat. It’s so nice to know that I can look forward to using the money I would have spent on something that I can keep and use, and also something that isn’t going to harm my health any longer!

the physical cravings are bad - sometimes horrible - but the prolonged mental strain is worse for me: the fragility of my self esteem and the need to not be complacent. the shame i felt was massive when i started smoking again after such a long time without, and being a smoker for so long again after failing to quit was just because i was convinced i couldn't do it, that i'd just start again eventually, and that i was weak.

this time (after watching 'rocky' on boxing day - obviously) i know i can do it. the one thing i've decided to do this time that i haven't before is look for support in a community - so i'm posting this!

good luck to everybody else who is doing the same thing. hopefully we can help each other.

I still have a few cravings a day, but they’re beat as fast they come.  Seriously, they hit; I take maybe 3 or 4 deep breaths and they’re gone.  
Yesterday, day 22, I did have some wicked cravings roll through.  Again, breathing deep, repeating my mantra, sipping water/candies helped.  Yesterday’s were just more harsh than today.  
My entire body, not just my lungs and throat, feel so much more relaxed.  I actually feel like I can handle more stress than when I smoked- or at least handle it better.  My mind is clear- I’m not constantly thinking about when my next cig is.  
I have a lot more energy; and I am sleeping a lot better.  I am accomplishing more because I don’t need to take constant smoke breaks.  
I can’t really pin point exactly what it is w this quit that’s making it go.  I think it’s a multitude of factors.  This subreddit definitely helps- just opening and reading/posting when you are going through the early stages was and still is a great distraction to the cravings for me.  
The smoke free app has helped track all the positives; whether it be the over $340 saved so far; the benefits to my health like how my breathing has become easier; or how the nicotine and carbon monoxide is completely out of my system.  The missions on the app are great too- I like the missions that ask you to interact with others, whether it’s through this subreddit or with family and friends.  
The mantras really help me when hard cravings come on.  In the earliest stages my favorite mantras were “a craving is not a command”, “not another puff, no matter what”, and my personal favorite “I AM A NON-SMOKER” (you gotta say it w gusto though- seriously, say if 10 times- the first few sound indecisive, by the 10th it’s adamant). When I was craving hard I would repeat these over and over in no particular order- sometimes I would only say one over and over, sometimes I would mix them in together.  
I think one big thing that helped me was just saying to myself “fuck it, I’m being selfish this month.  This month is about me; and I am not going let myself stress about work, friends, even family stuff.  I can do more good for myself, and others, once I get this crap out of my system and beat 100% of this addiction.”
Addiction- my past quits I never fully admitted or came to terms with the fact that I am an addict.  This quit I have come to the realization that I am an addict; and I now admit it fully.  It is difficult, scary, agonizing, intimidating to admit.  Why?- because in the back of my head I know that, along with admitting Im an addict, I have to admit I can never, ever take another puff of a cigarette in my life.  I know now that it’s not going to be “just one puff” or “just one cig”- I know now that it’s the first puff to becoming addicted to nicotine again.  Because I am an addict I can never have another puff of a cigarette again; ever; non-negotiable; period;- it can not happen.  It’s definitive and resolved that I can never smoke again.
Even typing this last portion about addiction brought on some anxiety and fear while typing it- That’s what nicotine does to the human brain- it makes intelligent, rational people think they need to slowly kill themselves to handle everyday things.  Before I ever started smoking when I got stressed i never said “I need a cig”; only after I was addicted did my addicted brain say “a cig will help you relax”.  It makes me mad that I chose to put myself through that, and now through the sucks of the quit.  
Rationally thinking this through steels my resolve even more to kick this disgusting, expensive, life draining addiction.",19,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.8809273838996887}"

I'm looking for some advice about a very delicate situation, sorry in advance about poor English.  


My family is 4/4 long time smokers, but due to a recent domestic accident that damaged her ribs and lungs my mother had to quit for a couple of weeks and she's been successful with that. The thing is... lung has healed, ribs are healing fast, she will soon be able to leave the house and she's already mentioned she's going to start smoking again. Only the 1-3 cigarettes she feels she ""needs"" but we all know how that works.

  
She was already diagnosed with COPD about 2 years ago but even after that she would still be reluctant to quit. Her recent accident seemed to have worked scaring her (and all of us) enough to consider staying quit, but that's passing too.  
We are all aware we have a huge part in her problem, and since she was hospitalized we came to the conclusion it was time for all of us to quit and that would be the only way for her to make it... but that hasn't worked out very well either. There is no cigarette smoked at home anymore and we all have reduced a lot the amount of daily cigarettes consumed, I have personally reduced from a whole packet to 2-3. That was a huge improvement but it's not enough. I feel this is like a train passing right now and we have to find a way not to miss it.

  
During the last 2 weeks of my mother's recovery i tried 2 times to quit for good, unsuccessfully. My father has bought a spray he's not using and he's planning to buy pills, but procrastinating. My sister doesn't live with us, but she wants to quit as well. I should also mention the main reason why i'm currently allowing myself those 2-3 daily cigarettes is a 3 years long severe depression that has only recently started to improve. I'm a bit scared i might go back into that state again but i also feel i kinda have to man up fast in order not to miss that train.  


It's a very delicate situation, I think my next move should be just quit for good (eaaaasy) and hope to inspire people around me. My biggest fear is to see my mother start chain smoking again anyway and lose her in a couple of years. She's been 2 weeks clean so far, how can I help her keep it up?

I’ve been a smoker since I was 15 years old, a pack a day smoker since I was 17 years old, now just recently turned 25, I can’t see myself continuing to smoke. 

But honestly, I can and the nasty little demon we call Nicotine, tells me to keep on puffing those tasty little fuckers. I don’t want to listen to him but he always wins. 

Rewind 12 hours ago when I put out my “last cigarette.” As the cig was winding down, I took my “last drag” and threw it away. “Fuck the cigarettes, I’m going to be smoke free for 2020, I fucking got this shit !!” 

All I could think about was how would I react when I wanted that next cigarette. Well, let me tell you, as soon as my buddy texted me on Snapchat telling me he’s going to the store, that dirty cunt Nicotine took full advantage of my nicotine addiction, pulled that 20$ out of my savings, and hitched a ride to go get more. 

I really thought I had some more willpower than this, but at the drop of a hat I’m sitting here with an American Spirit in my left hand, typing out why tf I can’t quit smoking. I want to. Fuck, I need to. Spending nearly $12 a pack, (Gotta love California) everyday, is literally breaking me. I know this, yet I continue on a path of self destruction, only to be killing myself in the process. Physically and mentally...

What’s up reddit. This is my first post cause I couldn’t find anyone else asking about this. My dad is turning 59 in a few days and has been smoking cigarettes (malboros) for a while. Not sure how long. I’ve known he’s been smoking for some time now and never confronted him about it but now that I am 18 I am thinking about buying him a juul. He has kept it a secret from me and my sister for our lives. I’ve gotten to the point where I need to do something about it. My grandma (his mother) was recently hospitalized to do complication from her smoking and my grandpa (his father) passed away at a young age before I was born due to a heart attack (he smoked also). My father works long hours and has a very stressful job providing for our family. I’m aware that getting him to quit smoking would be very difficult for him so I want to buy him a juul because it is a better alternative to smoking. I am just not sure how he will respond to me buying him a juul because he doesn’t know that I know he smokes. I’m looking for advice from people that have gone through a similar situation or could provide any insight for me. Should I get him mint pods or tobacco or another flavor? Should I buy a juul for him or just suggest the idea to him? Should I get him 3% pods or 5% pods or both? (I’m not sure how many cigarettes he smokes) but I know he does daily. I just want my dad to be healthy and want him to be around to know my children and I want my children to know him because his father didn’t get that chance. (If I have kids lol). Any advice or suggestions are appreciated. Thanks",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9934564232826233}"

Last night/today mark 3 months since I went cold turkey. Whipeee. I joked about having a cigarette at midnight but when the time came the thought disgusted me. It seems so gross knowing the lasting damage they cause. And with my (most likely) psychosomatic shortness of breath I don’t even know if I could smoke another cigarette.

With that said, I’m severely disappointed and bitter that since I’ve quit I’ve felt increasingly worse. I’m a fucking wreck, honestly. I’m convinced I have COPD even though everyone around me (including my Dr) has said I don’t. I feel short of breath, more anxious than ever and now I’m spitting up blood. Most likely it’s a gum infection and I’m going to the dentist on Friday but I can’t help but be terrified of what it means if it isn’t a gum infection. I know this is probably me wishing on some subconcious level that I’ll pay for the years of smoking, as if to will some cause and effect order to the universe upon myself and statistically I haven’t done enough damage to warrant any worry (1/2-1 1/2 packs a day for 10-11 years/27-28M) but I can’t shake the fact that right now I feel way worse than I ever did at the height of me being a smoker. 

So. With 2020 officially here I’m hoping that eventually I start feeling better. The path feels pointless right now but at least I’ve lost an appetite for cancer sticks, which is something I suppose.",3,{'infect': 2},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9995606541633606}"

I kinda thought this was common knowledge until I started telling some smokers that I never really quit, but realized I hadn't smoked in a long time.

Basically it's this: I knew I couldn't quit but I knew I wanted to smoke less. So I'd try to go longer without smoking, or when I was smoking two at a time I just would smoke one really deep. 

Got myself down to one midday, one evening, one at night. After that, one midday, one at night. After that, one at night. (it's a very long process, for me it took about two months to get from four a day to one a day)

Once you're down to one a day I recommend taking it easy on the cutback. Accept one a day as the new standard. From that day forth, I recommend disallowing yourself from ever smoking tobacco/nicotine more than once in a day, no matter what. I also recommend saving it until before bed, until you're confident in your ability to get through the night without one and have done so for a few weeks straight. 

The idea here is, don't tell yourself you're quitting. I've learned there's a lot of people, myself included, who struggle with doing things they say they will do, especially when it's miserable and uncomfortable. It's so much easier on the psyche, body, and mind to get through this difficult transition with the mentality of: I must smoke less.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9932509064674377}"

Did I get some real bad cravings today; and took my own advice.  They came on hard, and unexpectedly.  They didn’t last long at all thankfully, but I definitely felt them.  I had to back up a little and think it through.  In the beginning of my quit I knew I would have cravings and I knew I just had to suffer through them.. so that’s what I did- did anything I could to get my mind off cigs and suffered through them.  I laid back and breathed deep; repeated my mantra; typed some random friends a happy new year greeting; did some pushups.  
For the people not as far in to this- please learn from me- don’t ever let your guard down.  The cravings will sneak up on you; and they will hit you like a ton of bricks.  Stay strong.  Know the cravings suck, and know you can’t quit smoking without getting through them.  Just deal with them- They’re going to happen- have a plan for them already in place for when they do come on. 
We can all do this!!

Edit (9:10pm)- these cravings are still coming in waves.  I’m good for a while, then a major craving comes on; it goes away; then 15 minutes later another comes on.  It’ll settle down for a while; then start up in waves again.  I know I just have to let them come.  I’m telling myself it’s the nicotine battling w my brain to try and convince me to smoke.

I haven't smoked in about 12 hours and I am feeling motivated. I couldn't have picked a better time to quit. Maybe it's in my head but it just feels like change is happening around me.

I have smoked for about 12 years, I'm 28, and this habit is Killing me. I want nothing more than to stop smoking for good to prove to MYSELF that I am able to love myself and not rely on my pacifier to get me through tough situations. Life is not easy, and neither is quitting smoking. But we can do both with support from this community, our loved ones, and OURSELVES. Never ever give up! Happy New year!",9,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.94210284948349}"
