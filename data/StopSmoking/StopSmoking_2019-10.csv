I’ve gone from being a chain vaper (never ever left my hands or lungs for over 5 years) to quitting nicotine cold turkey. I’m at 22 days and some odd hours and minutes free from the devil chemical. My mother-in-law quit vaping just a bit before me and I currently have an entire bag of vaping supplies sitting on my kitchen table (it’s caused me mega anxiety for 3 days) Both of my parents still vape so she wanted me to pass it along to them. I’ve had a shit week and decided I deserved to take a few puffs off of one of her old vapes with 0mg juice. I took 3 puffs. IT DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR ME. I immediately put it back in the box. Why TF did I let those little electronic sticks control so much of my happiness???? SO SO SO DUMB!!! I’m so angry at myself for wasting years on this crap. Always hiding it from my husband. Feeling guilty every time I took out money to buy juice or coils. Constantly stressing out that my vape wouldn’t be charged and/or break. Actually CANCELLING plans if I knew I couldn’t vape. Not fully enjoying vacations/trips away from home bc I knew I couldn’t get juice/coils/fix my vape if it broke readily.  How awful. I was never addicted to cigarettes. Never really liked them (I know. Dumb that I got into vaping anyway). This has been tough as shit and I’m still kind of low and depressed but DAMN. this revelation tonight is awesome.

I was smoking up to a pack a day. I smoked for 5 years straight since the day I picked up my first cigarette. This is my first time ever attempting to quit. The thought never passed my mind, and when it did I was never seriously considering it. Until that day, for some reason. I just refused to let myself buy another pack. I never thought it out, it was just such an odd impulse. 
I had a nervous breakdown by the end of the day from my anxiety and caved in to a few drags off of a friends cigarette. 
Then just like that, in just one day, I went from a pack a day, to only 3-5 DRAGS a day! Here and there i’d steal a drag off my fiancé’s or a friend. Then a friend gave me their old vape with a very low nicotine amount in it. I used it for about 2 weeks, and then I got rid of it. Every since I have not smoked.
I’m extremely proud of myself considering i’ve been pulling myself through this on sheer willpower and impulse. I feel better mentally now, quitting helped me realize how many feelings I was avoiding and ignoring by just smoking. If i felt mad, i’d smoke. Anxious, smoke. Sad, smoke. Excited, smoke. Bored, smoke. It was in hand with everything I did, and without it, it was hard to mentally cope with my everyday life. Once I was aware that was my trigger, I was able to work on that and it made quitting so much easier. I hope you all the best in your journey. xo",4,0

To make this quick and easy there's three important steps in order to quit smoking permanently and not relapse.

1. Eliminate your belief's about what smoking does for you. It does nothing but hurt your health and keep you addicted.
2. Shift your mindset
3. Have someone hold you accountable. A friend, family member or mentor which can guide you to success by holding your hand the whole way.

I've been vaping more and more as of late and have decided I want to try and at least cut my use down significantly. I have several boxes of patches leftover from my last serious attempt at quitting, and they are all Step 3s - 7mg per patch, as my nicotine intake back then was far lower than it is now. Obviously 3 x 7 = 21, and I can't see why tripling up would deliver any difference in effect vs. using one of the stronger patches at a time, but I want to be sure that they aren't going to diffuse too much nicotine into me due to the greater surface area, or something weird like that.

By 20, I had promised myself that I would quit before 30.  Well, I cut it much closer than I ever thought I would, but my final smoke was 30 days before my 30th, just about 4 months ago.  After so many attempts that caused me to be emotional, sad, apathetic, depressed, and disgusted for being an addict, my quitting process was mundane, immediate, and anti-climatic.  I barely even noticed I had quit, I hadn't planned it, I just never bought another pack (actually, I threw away my last few).   This may be because I had been down to less than 5 a day for over a year, but I still expected... I don't know what.  Something?  Anyways, in the end, I couldn't be more pleased about this.  I'm laughing at myself for quitting almost by accident and without much thought or change to my life otherwise.  The timing was also coincidental, I had almost forgotten about the promise I had made to myself.  Possibly because I quit my real problem addiction (booze) almost 2 years ago, smoking was no longer caught up in such a destructive lifestyle, that it was easier to recognize that I was done with smoking as well.  I'm having a coffee now, watching the sun rise, while my partner who has never seen me smoke or drink is getting a few more minutes of sleep before we celebrate 1 year together.  I've never felt so much hope.  Thanks for spending a few moments with me, I woke up with this ramble in my head, and could probably be more eloquent, but my coffee is getting cold.

I pretty much never think about smoking these days and haven't had a craving in forever. Seeing smokers doesn't trigger me at all which I never thought would happen early in my quit. When I quit smoking I replaced it with alcohol so my drinking got out of control so I decided to quit drinking as well. And it has been a year that I have been alcohol free.

It's an amazing feeling to not have any sort of cravings whether it be for alcohol or tobacco. I still struggle with depression on and off but I don't have the black shadow of cigarettes or getting drunk to haunt me. Quitting both has made things at home much better with the wife and kids. I'm a better father and husband and I'm glad I am setting a good example for them.

I tried everything to quit smoking from Chantix to gum to patches to black pepper oil, you name it. But what finally worked for me was Allen Carr and hypnosis (which is actually how he quit).

This is the hypnosis video I used: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6A1IOkIsM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6A1IOkIsM)

Right now I'm on my 2nd day without a smoke. I smoked a pack a day since 2011. I used to smoke 2+ packs a day and quit for 11 years using gum/patches/entertainment on the net.   


Yep! I picked up smoking after quitting for over 11 years. Not a smart idea. I've been trying to quit ever since I picked up again. That makes it an 8 year relapse. I'm kidding - I'm not pretending it was a relapse. It was/is/? a full blown smoking extravaganza -- just like I didn't stop for 11 years prior.   


So here I am. On my 2nd day quit. I have 4 mg nic gum. I use liquid Stevia for when I can't chew gum. I have invisialigns and can't take them out whenever I want. The aligners have to stay in 22 hours a day. Stevia works ok - just as good as the gum, actually. 

Here at work it's going smooth. Nobody is bothering me today though. It's quiet and I can be lazy. Tomorrow my boss's calendar is blank so that means she's going to be here all day. She drives me nuts. I may have to run errands for the office tomorrow. She never asks where I go so I'm taking advantage of it.

Finally I have a light of hope with a new job offer and within a week I have to move 200 miles, go to court to modify divorce decree because I am required by the original decree (14 years ago) to stay at my specific residence/house - I am captive - and I have to start a new job in a new city, rent out my current house, pack, move...and deal with truly sick and evil mother and siblings who want nothing more than to fucking shit on me and destroy any chance I have at a job. My ex husband is fighting my move even though I am required by law and the divorce decree to drive the child back for the visitation every other weekend - to and from - which I obviously will do or will be in contempt of court. The child is almost 14. I need this job - I have been out of work for a year and finally got a job and it’s a good one at an executive level. His only  response was that I am required to stay in my residence (I guess for life?) and the only way he’d agree is if he gets to stop paying child support. So in the middle of packing, moving, renting out a house and finding a place to rent - I had to figure out how to file pro se to modify the decree, and then ask for emergency temporary orders because i have to give him at least 45 notice for the final modification hearing - and I need to be at my new job Nov 1.
In my immediate family I have lawyers: 3 siblings, one sister in law, two cousins, 2 nephews - 8 lawyers in this city - not one would help me figure out how to do this. One of those asshole relatives  said I probably ambushed my ex and that’s why he’s giving  me trouble - not true, I told him I was interviewing in the other city months ago and he asked our daughter about it. Then same asshole relative told me to pray the rosary - he actually said that instead of just telling me what fucking template to use for the motion to modify decree. And yes - he knows how to do it. Why he wouldn’t help me I don’t know. I guess because I’m just a woman. He helps my brother who isn’t a lawyer all the time, but since I am the only single mom in our family (or “divorced whore” as they laughingly called me when my first husband abandoned me and my kids in 2003).

So yeah, all I fucking want is a goddamn cigarette. I dreamt about it last night. In my dream I bought Marlboro Lights. 

I told my 13 year old and she told me to get on reddit. I take the Wellbutrin to help with cravings - but this is overpowering.

I won’t smoke, but I want to so bad. But I won’t. It is the calming effect the smoking had when I was stressed and breaking down. 

The last straw came today. My mother and oldest spinster sister live 3 miles from me. They haven’t been to my house in 10 years. We have tried and made a point to go there at least once a year - just so my kids could see their grandma. Finally last night when they found out I was moving - they came over for dinner. I was happy but not overly optimistic. My mother asked me to help login to her email - I did. And I don’t know if she wanted me to see this or just didn’t care - but right there in the inbox was an email reply to a request she had made to my former employer who fired me in 2011.  I had another job since then. She made an Open Records request for all my personnel records, investigations, notes, interviews. She made it in 2013, in 2017 and again just now - the same exact request. I was so stunned. I never kept my firing a secret. I fought that termination and won with the state finding they had no cause to fire me.
But the fact she is that deceptive and fucking cruel to do that. All these years I thought she just forgot about me and in reality she and my evil spinster sister were trying to dig up dirt on me. I am sure it’s to alert my new employer and try and get me fired.

What’s the point of not smoking when I literally have zero joy in life? Yes I love my kids - love them. 
But my life is solely work, stress, worry about money, cook, clean, help kids with homework, pay bills, deal with teenagers fighting and trying to teach them to be good people - and I have nothing else. No friends anymore because I’m just depressed. No boyfriend because the last one messed me up with his cheating and lies and I am so mad at myself that I let him treat me that way for 3 years. I don’t ever want to date again. 

I have to fight my ex husband just so I can move and work — and deal with his gross “deal” of allowing me to move if I cut child support.
I am so stupid! In the 14 years since we divorced, I never once asked for more child support - I could have had it reviewed every 3 years. And when his older son aged out after high school, his child support for our daughter should have gone up -  but I didn’t make a stink because at least he came and got her every other weekend and paid some child support. I never hassled him when he left town with her and didn’t tell me. I never said no when he wanted to change dates. And all that did was make him think he was entitled to those accommodations. He is an ingrate. He has done THE MINIMUM - he doesn’t ever see her outside the visitation weekends despite my repeated invitations to get her whenever he wants. He doesn’t pay for anything - just the paltry lowest amount of child support required by the state. He doesn’t pay her cell phone, buy her clothes or school supplies. He doesn’t even help her with homework. 

And now I feel the avalanche of shit falling on me - the ex, a court hearing, moving, not having enough money, learning a new job and people after being totally fucked at my last two jobs (7 years at each place) and knowing my psychotic mother and evil spinster sister have gone to great lengths to retrieve personnel records of mine from a job I left 7 years ago. 

I am broken. I honestly don’t see why not smoke. I am tired. I have nothing to look forward to tomorrow but another day of fucking stress and work and packing and figuring out how the law works and grinding my teeth about money ... I can’t think of happiness I have had (outside my kids) since 1989.
That’s when I met my alcoholic first husband and began a cycle of taking abuse. And my mother is a very evil toxic person who never loved me or my siblings and I’m sure that’s why they’re such assholes.

I don’t ever drink and I want to smoke so bad I can taste it. I am weakening. I am scared and alone and broken inside. 


I sound like an asshole I know. It’s 4 am and I want to run to the gas station and buy a pack of smokes. It was so hard to quit. I keep thinking maybe I could just have a couple and not fall back into it.

They’ve been smoking for about 2 years, and I’ve tried presenting options and plans to help, like moderately reducing number of cigarettes by one each week (it gets more complicated the closer to 0 but that’s the basic concept).  

They use cigarettes as an outlet for stress and anxiety and pain in general, and I don’t want to rip an outlet away.  Has exercise been helpful to anyone?  I figured that would be a healthy way to commit energy and release the stress throughout the day, starting is probably the hardest step because a smoke is an easier option.  Sorry, I just want to be able to help them.

Hoping dealing with this now pays off in the long run. I also never quit with an empty pack, so I have 2 cigarettes roughly 50 feet away.

so far it didnt seem to help, im still vaping as much as I ever did, but today I tried something different, I mixed up some vape juice at 3mg instead of 6mg

and it was only uncomfortable for a few hours, I dont know if I could have always have done this, or the varenicline made it easier

new plan, ill continue to take the varenicline just in case, but im not going to count on it to work, im going to cut my nicotine in half every few days

so today I cut from 6 to 3, in a few days ill cut from 3 to 1.5, a few days after that ill cut to .7 and ill probably try to jump from .7

hopefully all these transitions work as smoothly as my 6 to 3 transition today, if they do I think ill be a non user in no time

Depression sucks and may last longer than you expect. See your doc about temporary solutions to assist you while you quit if needed. Don't just assumed it will take an arbitrary number of days or weeks for it to pass and try to ""get through it"". You shouldn't force yourself to suffer unnecessarily.
2. Don't give in! It gets easier but so far cravings have still not gone away. Even last night I saw a guy smoking in front of a convenience store and my brain tried to convince me to ask the guy to buy a smoke off him. 
3. Try not to replace smoking with another bad habit. For whatever reason slush puppies seemed to replace smoking for me. I gained 50lbs since I quit smoking and now I'm trying to cut back on junk food/sugary drinks and it just making me crave cigarettes when I deny myself the sugar or fatty foods I'm craving. 
4. Don't get discouraged if you don't feel better right away. As I quit I put on weight and now I physically feel worse that before I quit. That being said my anxiety dropped off to almost nothing so mentally I feel significantly better.
5. Know your limits, better to play it safe than sorry. Reintroduce yourself to the things that you used to do while smoking but take your time if you need to. If I would have jumped back into phone games right away or working on stuff in my garage I don't know if I would have stayed quit. 
6. Reward yourself/ celebrate when you make it to your milestones. Knowing I made it *this* (what ever amount of days/months) far has been a major factor in giving me the willpower to deny myself the temptations like last night.

I quit at 21 and went four years without a cigarette.  I’ve had some only when drinking every couple months otherwise I never touch them.  I’ve probably had 30 cigs in 5-6 years.  I just recently stopped drinking so I won’t even be tempted.  I never buy packs I’ve just bummed them.  I feel so terrible about it.  What should I do? Should I beat myself up over that? 30 in 5 years isn’t too bad is it? Mind you I’ll never ever drink or smoke again.  Total I’ve smoked one year and 30 cigarettes since. I’m 26 now,1,0

I so over it, I’m done with the health anxiety smoking brings, the sneaking around because I’m so ashamed, and the way it basically rules my entire day.

Anyway for context im 21 and have smoked for approx 4 years heavily w minor breaks. Ive always smoked weed, since i was 14 with friends.

But not why im here.

At the beginning of college I was introduced to moles (bowls of tobacco and weed layered over each other). Got me hooked and from then on  had me smoking moles every once and a while instead of a typical bowl a greens. Then every other time. Eventually i only smoked moles exclusively. At my worst I was packing bowls with pouch tobacco and sprinkling flakes of weed dust onto the top layer, enough to give me the illusion of an actual ratio. 

But yea, here we are now. At my senior year still ripping them on occasion w little will to quit again. My cough sounds like death and the last week ive reproduced myself in mucus at least once.

Sbout an hour ago i rubber banded up my pouch of light blue spirit.

This is the new approach, as I typically just throw it away. Sadly it seems to always lead to me buying a fresh one days later. New approach is to add one piece of duck tape (a day) over the bag until its fully covered. By then hopefully the cravings will have passed and I can better focus on my shit.

Gonna add on to this once a day to try and remind myself why my life needs to do a reverse pronto. Also just to give me something to think about",5,0

At 15, when I started smoking, I vowed that I will quit when I'm 30. On the day of my birthday, I smoked 3 cigarettes. Left one in the pack. 23rd of october, morning, I had my last cigarette. Yesterday I had an operation in my throat and nose (non cancer or smoking related) and to be honest, I do not miss smoking one bit. I drink my coffee, eat my food (no alcohol yet due to operation) and I do not miss it one bit. I used to be a heavy smoker. Having like 20 cigs a day, and when I went out, could have 20 more on the night out only (with alcohol or just coffee). Now, clean as a whistle. I get slight sleepyness or minor headaches, but those can be battled. Good thing is I had this operation, 2 weeks downtime from work, I started before that, so by the time I'm fully of the meds (2 days from now) nicotine dependence will be gone. The only thing that gives me a cig craving is the habit. Missing the taste of the cig, or going out of the house for a break every now and again (I still do, but without a cigarette now)

But what these issues have in common is that it is bad for YOU. And most people really don't care too much about their future self. They can only really relate something harmful if they have already experienced it and it lasted more than a couple of days. Because lots have had that very bad hangover from alcohol that took easily half a week to sober up, but look it's Friday again and the alcohol starts flowing again...

So if you have a good enough why you can endure any how. And my reason will only help a very small sub-group of people.

I recently came upon a study mentioned in this podcast episode: https://after-on.com/episodes-31-60/046
That they have linked seasonal allergies and asthma to chronic smoking of your parents and/or their parents and/or etc. So if any of your ancestry was a chronic smoker, there is a heightened chance that you will have issues with your air ways. So smoking defects your gene pool and prones your offspring to have air way issues.

Now anyone who has asthma, or seasonal allergies, or other air way allergies like house dust can blame their genes for that condition.

tl;dr if you have experienced asthma or seasonal allergies and want to have children, then as a righteous person you wouldn't want your children to suffer the experience!",0,0

Recently I got a sinus infection and having to smoke cigarettes sucked, so I figured ""hey, I'm sick anyway, might as well go through nicotine withdrawals while I'm at it.""

It actually wasn't too bad until around day 5. The week after that was terrible, I had to do a lot of driving as I'm in the middle of moving, and I couldn't stop thinking about how much I wanted to smoke while driving around.

My buddy offered me a spliff over a week ago, and I almost convinced myself ""oh, just one drag, fuck it."" Then I mentioned to him that I was trying to quit, and he told me that if I take that ONE HIT it will invalidate my entire quitting process. He said if I take one hit I'll validate smoking again because I'll think ""well, I did take that one hit and it wasn't too much. I can just smoke a *little bit.*""

Last night marked officially 3 weeks since any nicotine has entered my body. The cravings are still there. Last night was a big test for me because I got really drunk with some homies and they are all still smokers. It felt really weird not having a cigarette with them but I managed to stick it out!

There's only one thing better than wistfully staring into the middle distance and mulling over your life as you drag on a cigarette... and that's having someone watch you, as you do it! 

Why is a cigarette my social crutch? I remember spending time at a very scary Memphis Greyhound Bus Station, yet as soon as I pulled out a ciggie, I felt 10ft tall, like I was almost playing the character of a super confident person that could handle anything. I also noticed that people thought differently of me as I started smoking, we had a shared humanity, a common bond. 

I honestly think I smoke because I love the response it elicits from people around me. I know that intellectually they don't think I'm cool doing it, but there's just something so introspective and artistic about the habit. 

I've never been addicted to it, so I've never actually got to the stage where I'm just smoking as another vice. It's always instead, been a measured, theatrical activity. 

 I really need to shake it off and am considering hypnotherapy to help perhaps plant some negative feelings about smoking in my brain as opposed to my rose-tinted, pop culture, movie saturated feelings about it.

They numb me to all the pain that I’ve accumulated over the years. I’ve been suicidal for close to a decade now. I started smoking right when I entered that state, after I swore to my loved ones that I wouldn’t attempt to take my life again. It gives me peace of mind to know that I’m slowly killing myself.

I honestly don’t see much hope in life for an over-emotional, fearful, and boring person such as myself. 

Lately I’ve been trying hard to overcome that, going back to the gym, attempting to connect with people. 

But people are so strange. Or I should say that I’m very strange. It’s hard trying to adapt to a world that’s so different from you and your beliefs. 

But the loneliness is relentless and I find that I have to try. I can’t waste my life hiding in the dark, afraid to live.

I’m afraid that if I quit smoking the wall will break and I’ll give in. It only takes one moment of weakness. And being an over-emotional over thinker, getting easily attached to people, and being discarded by others so easily makes it easy for me to fall into despair.

184,2019-10-23 20:11:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/dm8cl9/tough_but_optimistic_experiment/,Tough but optimistic experiment,"Hey guys, first of all I would like to start by saying how inspiring and supporting this community on reddit is.

I don't really expect anyone will read this, it's more for me and I think I might comment here daily with how I feel about the stuff that I'm changing. Neither do I believe I will last very long but I want to experience the good side of things that will come when I make these habits part of my life, so that I have something to aim for.

With that out of the way, I would like to share with you this experiment I have in mind - to quit everything bad at once and start doing healthier things instead. I know it is advised to drop bad habits slowly or progressively but hell, I never had any success with this approach. Here are habits I'm dropping as of 25. October:

**PMO** \- I'm not really having any problems in this area as I find it dead simple to go weeks without looking at porn or even masturbating. I just find this idea of me jerking off to pictures silly. You see, the people who raised me were very disciplined in many areas of life and in my mind, there is no doubt that they were slaves to masturbation. I want to be at least the same good role model to my children one day as my family was to me.

**Smoking** \- This is a big tough one - I've been smoking for a while now and it is around a pack a day. I wanted to drop this habit for quite some time now but somehow I never had the willpower to do so long term. I  want to quit cold-turkey, no excuses and just get through the tough moments. Not escaping from the negative thoughts, feelings and craving, but rather embracing them and learn to live with them until the go away. Most difficult times for me will be being at home and have nothing to do and then breaks at work.

**Coffee** \- This one I have no problem getting through and I haven't drank it for a few weeks now.

**Sugar** \- Another big one. For a year or so, I've been eating something sweet almost every day and drank a can of energy drink or cola everyday. From what I've heard, the craving for sugar will disappear around 2 weeks mark. 

Excessive use of my laptop - I have realized that it's very easy for me to go into this ""research mode"" and spend an entire day, even night, looking at the screen. I'm not really addicted to the phone and I barely use TV. I'm going to set times for when I need to use the computer and in it's stead, go out for a walk or do something else. Each day I will allow myself to use the pc from around 8 am until 2 pm for programming, which is my hobby and also I would like to have a career in this field. And on the evening, around 7 pm, half hour for checking and replying to emails, social media, paying rent and other similar activities. 

&#x200B;

Now the things I'm introducing to my life:

**Hydration** \- I'm quite a big guy so I'm going to focus on drinking at least 4 liters of water throughout the day. Also, Tea in the morning or evening if I feel like it. I would recommend you guys drinking warm or lukewarm water/tea in the morning, as the body doesn't need to use energy to warm it up inside you. I realized I'm not getting enough water when, on one evening I drank a lot of it and I noticed how much better I felt and my mood got a lot better. 

**Gym** \- Been going on and off for a few months now but I would like to go every second evening. I aim to lose weight and building muscle at the same time by doing a bit of cardio and a compound strength training. Currently at 105 kg. Hydration and cutting sugar also helps.

**Clean eating** \- I have a bunch of recipes I want to get into. It's not that I've been eating like a pig but I would certainly like to eat healthier.

**Learning new thing/hobbies** \- I play guitar and technically I'm very proficient but I want to learn more theory and enhance my improvisation skills. I'm also trying to get into singing.

And that's it for now. I might come up with new ideas for hobbies or feel free to recommend something to me. I will have a lot of time to do something new, especially in the afternoons, when I'll be avoiding smoking and sugar.",2,0

I had quit for 3 weeks about 6 months ago. Family visited for a week and stressed me out to the point of me starting again the moment they left. 

I was recently thinking about quitting and a number of things happened at the same time which made me decide the past week. 

Firstly I got sick. No fever anything but a terribly runny nose and a terrible cough. Was wheezing and coughing so much my tissues would get soaked from coughing only. Took showers constantly for the steam to clear my lungs up. Even though I k we this cough and other symptoms would pass, I realized this would be my life if I didnt stop. 

Secondly, I always told myself I would need to carry the responsibility of someone else in order to convince myself to stop smoking. Having kids or something you know. Out of nowhere I decided to get a kitten. A coworker knew someone who was looking to rehome and I was thinking about it anyway so I said I'll take the lil baby. I knew I wouldn't be able to smoke at home with her around not because I wouldn't physically be able to bur because she didnt deserve the smoke all around the house fucking her lungs up. Them I got her and looked in her eyes an was convinced I wouldn't be able to smoke and feel good about it. She was the responsibility I needed.

Lastly I had built my self up to quit. I would ask myself how I felt after each smoke and the answer was never ""good"". It was very very rarely ""fine"". But then I would compare how i felt with how i would have felt if i didnt smoke and in comparison I would always feel terrible. 

I'm happy I made this desicion again. I hope it last much lo ger than last time. Last time I quit on a limb. I felt trapped and unable to breath on a bus and decided to quit. Now I feel like I have a stronger motivation and a deeper understanding of why I want to stay off smoking.

194,2019-10-23 04:39:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/dlwcjc/thoughts_on_not_smoking_anymore/,Thoughts on not smoking anymore.,"You know, my life has changed. Not dramatically, but slightly, on the inside. No big differences at first sight, most people won't notice a thing. But so many things have changed. I got more time. All the time I went for a smoke, the time smoking, the timeloss from the switch from task to smoking and back, it saves me at least an hour a day. I simply have more time now. I don't have to see I have enough tobacco (I rolled my own) for the weekend, I don't worry about it. I became much more self-conscient, in a positive way. It gives me more self confidence than before. It also drives me to take more care of my health, start building up regular movement and action, Also, more sex :) . Sometimes, I am a bit cross that nobody sees this, especially my SO and kids. 'Don't you see this? Don't you see what a tremendous change is happening? I'm almost another person!'

Is it over? No way. I still feel the addiction sometimes. And it's f\*cking sneaky... It has been waiting there in my mind and when the resistance is the lowest, it shows up. So there are days I have to make the promise to myself all over. Take the notes in my hands I made when I planned stopping, back in March. Remotivate myself. Taking the notes on how I felt when smoking. The headaches, the short of breath. the coughing. The ~~smell~~ stench - I didn't know ... I still like the fresh smell of tobacco, but the smell of 'old' cig smoke is terrible. The one that comes out the breath of a smoker. That kind. But I'm doing it. I sometimes forget about that part of my previous life. I don't think about smoking at all for several days.   I don't visit this sub daily anymore. I visit sometimes, to encourage others, because I know it can be the beginning of a new you.

So keep going. It's worth it. You deserve this. You can do this, because you have it in you.

Never stop stopping.

Things are so much better now.,"Time to circle back and give you all an update. Two years, two months and seven days ago I decided to quit the 20+ year habit of smoking a pack a day. It was hard at first. Really hard. But each day was easier and easier. Now I rarely think about it anymore and there are no cravings. What helped me a lot in the beginning was my stubbornness and resolve. And also the support I found on this sub and from certain people I met here. 

Knowing I was able to quit smoking gave me the confidence to tackle other issues and set other goals. After I had quit for a full year, I decided to tackle the next big one: losing weight. Another year later and another goal reached: lost 35kg (75 pounds) and have now a healthy BMI of 21 in a healthy non-smoking body. I like to think that knowing I could fight this addiction, gave me the idea I could do anything I set my mind to. It kickstarted a lot of things. 

Some of the savings I spent on a new gaming PC. It's amazing how far that €5 a day reaches after all this time. 

Anyway, I just wanted to report back. I rarely visit here anymore, but I do remember that it was great to hear from people who had quit and managed to stay quit. You can do this too!",65,0

Whether if it's only due to cigarettes I'm uncertain. 

Life moves swiftly when you're happy just 'being' instead of needlessly worrying or thinking about cigarettes all day. I can't imagine why I ever thought cigarettes were any good for me.

I'm not saying bad shit doesn't happen; I've learned I have hypertension and prediabetics. And now trying to Killit... Diet... Something like that 😅 And not because of weight concerns. I'm starting to realize carbohydrates may actually be as addictive as nicotine. I used to think that was bs. Anyone got some fries? 🤪🍟

Everytime I get a cold, smoking is surpassed by other priorities such as chamomile tea, mead and food in general. 

I utilize my cravings as a replacement for the cigarettes, this gets a lot easier, the more sore the throat is.  

Let the Cold win. Don’t do things you normally would do, instead stay in bed, binge watch something or listen to some music. While constantly hydrating with water and sleep inducing tea, such as Magnolia Bark, Valerian Root or Chamomile.

In your current drowsy sick state, make it as comfortable as possible. When it comes to food, try to eat something you are not used to.

The first 24 hours should be somewhat undemanding, as you have so much else to occupy you. 

24-48 hours in. This is you where you should start making a half-hearted attempt to keep you distracted. Save some binge worthy shows for this duration. 

48-72+ hour in.   
This is the hard one, here you might start to really get better, all the while your body is depleting its nicotine levels, making you crave nicotine. This duration is up to your power of will. 

  
TL;DR  
In my experience it is easier to quit smoking if combined with a common cold.",33,0

Hold the train! I know, this might sound like the worst possible thing to some people that are just starting their quit now. Remember though, each  quit and each person is different. Just continue on to see what I mean.

The first few days of my quit actually went by quite splendidly. I was ready for the physical cravings, I was busy with work, and I powered through those days pretty easily. What caught me, to my surprise, was my first weekend. I've never simply dreaded time, but that is exactly how I felt. I made it through the so-called ""toughest"" first days only to be blindsided by the second phase that I thought would be easier. I never realized how much time in my life was organized around smoking and all things related. The problem was that I was expecting one thing to be the hardest part of my quit and it simply wasn't for me.

We all have a different experience and history with cigarettes and smoking and quitting is the same. One person might swear by NRT (nicotine replacement therapy) and another might argue cold-turkey is the best way. Should you buy the Allen Carr book or just go to Joel's website ([https://whyquit.com/](https://whyquit.com/)) and use his free information? (ps, both of which are awesome resources!) The point being, each person who has quit successfully just found something that worked for them at that time. Nothing more and nothing less.

I say, DO WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU! ♥ Use all of the resources possible and don't let anyone tell you that there is only one way. Be open-minded because you will find many examples of people who could easily get past one of the challenges of quitting only to relapse in the future for a different reason. What might be the most challenging part of on person's quit could easily be a small side note in  your personal experience.",30,0

Almost caved in when I came back to my home country but resisted. Here's to a full year!,"It's actually surreal that I lasted this long, considering I have the worst self-control ever. I haven't smoked a cigarette in over a year but I had tried to quit vaping many times and always failed. It's just the flavors and the cool new gadgets that convinced me that it would be ""just one puff"" but it always ended up in me going back to my addiction. After reading Allen Carr's book, I realised that vaping nicotine never made me feel good. It just made me feel like shit until I can get my hit and go back to normal. So I gave my vape and liquids to a colleague who was trying to quit smoking but didn't have the money for an ecig, and marked the day that I was officially free from the chains of addiction (at least nicotine, still can't function without coffee).

While way less harmful than regular cigarettes, ecigs were still bad for my health. Because it was more difficult to monitor how much liquid you've used, I ended up vaping more nicotine than I have ever smoked from cigarettes. It ended up making me extremely anxious, and my heart would race constantly, sometimes to the point that I would feel nauseous and on the brink of throwing up.

Just last week, I came to visit family back in Bulgaria, and cigarettes are everywhere! They come in fancy packaging, advertisements aren't banned, and everyone I spoke to smokes a different cool-looking version of Camel, Lucky Strike or Marlboro. I was so tempted to buy a pack just for one cigarette, but I resisted because I did not want to reset my streak and lose months worth of progress. It's all thanks to you all! You reminded me that there is no such thing as ""just one cigarette"". 

To those of you currently on the fence or struggling, don't worry, you've got this! I thought I would never last so long after getting hooked to smoking cigs and vaping nicotine, so if I can do it, so can you! Godspeed.",147,0

I’m not a heavy smoker, but always turn to it during stress, boredom, social situations- I turn 40 in 6 months, it’s time to quit FOR GOOD!

I started Champix 10 days ago, last smoke was on day 5. It definitely makes me feel ill, but I’m enjoying it in a weird way, means it’s really working! I wish I’d known about this drug years ago. I hope this is it now. I plan to take the full 12 weeks, but we’ll see how I go.

Quit Smoking With Me was a side project of a clothing brand company (Quit Rich & QR Clothing Brand) I've been building that teaches financial education through story telling elements. I know, it's a new concept and you've got to see it to wrap your head around it. But once you see that smoking could cost you over a million dollars in financial opportunity you might just want to kick the habit for good! It may even be the best way to convince a child to never start in the first place!

I’m 33 years old and I want to tell you my story. My story of how smoking affected me and what it did to me. It’s probably gonna be a pretty long post and I don’t expect much feedback. Mainly I just want to write this for myself, but I thought I wanted to post it in here as well. To show whoever reads it how smoking can affect you. Not in the obvious physical way, but in the mental and psychological way and how it can affect your actions.

I’ve been smoking for 18 years or so. I’ve had a few weeks off the cigarettes now and then, but I’ve never really quit with the mindset “That’s it! Now I’m free”. Whenever I’ve tried to stop, in the back of my mind, I’ve always known that I at some point would end up smoking again. I’ve never imagined myself as a smoker and I never envisioned that I would still be smoking when I was 33. I’ve always wanted to stop for all the good reasons. I just couldn’t.

Ever since I started smoking, it has affected my actions. My parents are former smokers and they’re both now very critical of smoking which has always made me feel ashamed of smoking and made me want to hide it from them. I lived at home until I was 21 and up until that point, I tried to hide it from them. They knew I was smoking, I knew that they knew I was smoking, yet I would still not smoke when they were around. I would go visit friends just so that I could smoke. I would sneak out at night when my parents had gone to bed to smoke. I would stay home from family events so that I could smoke. When I was 18 my grandmother was in the hospital and my family went to say goodbye one night when the doctors called to say that this was the last call. I stayed home so that I could smoke. Yes, I never got to say goodbye to my grandmother because I would rather stay home and smoke. I feel ashamed to write that, but that’s the honest truth.

When I was 21 and moved away from home, I moved in with my girlfriend at the time. She knew that I was smoking, and although she wasn’t fond of it, she accepted it. The following years, my life as a smoker wasn’t as pathetic as it previously had been. I was just smoking as I wanted to and felt ok about it. When I was 28-29 or so, my girlfriend and I started talking about having kids and she begged me to stop smoking for health reasons and because of our future kids. I wanted to stop as well, so I did. At least that’s what my girlfriend thought. I never stopped. Instead I started smoking secretly. For the next two years, until my girlfriend and I split, I hid my smoking from everyone except my friends.

Smoking started affecting my every action. I would constantly text my girlfriend to know when she was coming home so that I knew if I could take another cigarette and let the smell wear off before she got home. I had a jacket hidden in the basement that I would go put on and hang back whenever I took a cigarette. I had a jacket in my car that I would put on when I was smoking on my way to and from work. See, I didn’t want my colleagues to know that I was smoking either, so I never smoked at work. Instead I would have two cigarettes on my way to work, and I started getting up early in the morning so that I could check in at work half an hour earlier than everyone else so that the smell could wear off before my coworkers signed in. Whenever I was driving to work, I would rush like a madman and get angry at other drivers if they were going too slow for my liking, because I knew that every minute counts when trying to get the smell to wear off before checking in at work. I work as a teacher and whenever I had an hour or two between classes I would get in my car, drive 5 kilometers away and go smoke in a safe place where no one could see me. I would have toothpaste and deodorant in my car. I would park my car in a different parking lot than the one owned by the school, because I didn’t want my coworkers to see me leaving and coming back every day, because I was afraid they would figure out what I was doing. Smoking had become an obsession.

I never relaxed because I was constantly thinking about when I could have my next fix. I would plan days ahead. “Ok, Tuesday my girlfriend is coming home at 5 pm, so I have to smoke my last cigarette of the day at 4 pm. Wednesday she’s out with friends until 7 pm, so I have to smoke my last cigarette at 6 pm and then quickly go take a shower so that my hair isn’t wet when she gets home, because she would find that suspect”. Yes, that was the kind of thoughts that I had, how pathetic and crazy it may sound. I refined my ways of hiding my smoking. I started wearing gloves so that my fingers wouldn’t smell – even at bright daylight, and I would constantly look around to see if anyone was noticing me and think that it was weird that I was wearing gloves in the summer.

Two years ago, my girlfriend and I split up. I had become a shadow of who I used to be, and smoking was a big part of that. I didn’t want to go out with her friends because then I couldn’t smoke. I would rarely suggest us doing something together, because I hoped she instead would go out and do something on her own or with friends so that I could stay at home and smoke. I started going for walks on my own so that I could smoke. I would make up appointments with friends and instead just go for a long walk so that I could smoke. I was afraid of getting too close to her the first few hours after I had smoked, so the way I physically showed that I loved her became less and less.

When we moved apart, I had big plans for my life. I needed to and wanted to change a lot of things. I wanted to exercise, gain some weight, eat healthier and most of all, I wanted to stop smoking. But for the next two years, I continued to smoke. I really wanted to stop, and I often set myself a date, prepared myself for the stop in all kind of different ways. I read Allan Carr, I made lists, I read on this subforum, I understand that nicotine is nothing but an addiction, downloaded apps etc. I would look forward to my stop date with joy and enthusiasm, but I just couldn’t stop. Many nights I would stand outside smoking, look at the cigarette and tell myself “This is it. This is the last one” and be really happy about it, but the next morning I would wake up knowing I would smoke again in a few minutes and say to myself “Man, yet another day as a smoker. I really don’t want to be smoking”, but I would. Whenever I looked in the mirror, I was unhappy with myself. My self-esteem was very low. I loathed myself. I just wanted to stop and be able to look in the mirror with a feeling of proudness. As mentioned, I often set stop dates. Tomorrow, next week etc., and I would look forward to it. But my stop dates also prevented me from changing other things in my life. I wouldn’t get to exercise and I wouldn’t get to eat healthier – in fact I ate very unhealthy – because I always said to myself “Alright, that’s the quit date. Until then you can live like this, and then you will change all these things”.

Smoking affected me badly. It changed and defined my life. I was living as a slave to cigarettes and they affected my every action and the way I saw myself. It ruined my self-esteem and my confidence, and it damaged my physical wellbeing.

So, you might be thinking, since you’re writing this in past-tense, I assume you’re now a non-smoker? I am. I quit last night after writing this. Writing this has made me realize how pathetic smoking is and what it’s done to me. When I was reading it through, I was thinking ""This is crazy. If that was someone else's post, I would think that that guy is really far out"". But it was me. And I don't want that to be me anymore. I was the most pathetic smoker of all. I have no trouble admitting that. But I’m not a pathetic person. In many other areas of my life, I’m a strong-willed, intelligent person with confidence in what I do. I just fell for the same trap that millions of other people have and it took over my life.

You quit just last night you might say? I did. But I’m 100% certain that I will never smoke again. I already feel so happy being free from the slavery and I look forward to whatever small improvements I might feel. And most of all, I look forward to the withdrawal symptoms and feeling the physical and psychological need to smoke and then knowing that I’m stronger than that and that I’m going to win that battle.

This is my story. The most pathetic smoker of all.",95,0

Yeah I do crave cigs, especially in my car or at work (im a truck driver and cigs were my everything)
All I do is chew a gum or browse my phone.


I feel like the more my day is fulfilled with tasks the easier it gets.
Yesterday at home I felt a bit depressed so I drove to my GF and spent the whole night, didn’t even think about cigarettes!

My point is that I don’t feel much of the withdrawals just some minor cravings and wondering if it will get dramatically harder in the following days..  and also share it so il have something to look at when things get harder!

Not even once.,"So I learned the hard way recently that you’re never done quitting and figured I’d share with y’all so you don’t repeat my mistake. I smoked for 3 years and quit cold turkey in August 2017. Late summer this year I was hanging out with a longtime friend who’s a heavy smoker and is going through some hard stuff. After a few drinks I decide, what the hell, I’ll have one to commiserate with him. Been nicotine free for 2 years, so this’ll just be like those social smokers who have one every once in a while right?

Wrong. One turned into another and another and another that night as we kept talking and we both kept working through his pack. Then the next night I’m hanging out with my housemates, mixed group of smokers and non-smokers, same as I had for the whole 2 years I quit, and I’m really feeling like a smoke. Next day I’m stressing out over school and decide stepping out for a quick smoke will make me feel better. But I’m only having one at a time, and only when I feel like it! Totally safe to buy a pack so I can stop bumming.

Long story short, a week after deciding to just have one for the first time in 2 years, I was exactly back to where I was before quitting. I’m smoking the same amount a day and with the same triggers and same stupid voice in my head. Walking to class in the morning? “Perfect amount of time for a cigarette.” Having trouble focusing on schoolwork? “Let’s step out for a smoke, that’ll bring your focus back.” Getting in the car? “Hey, smoke first in case you want one on the way.” And so on.

I’m also back to doing the exact same bullshit things I was doing last time: lying to myself about not being addicted, fighting with my girlfriend, sneaking around my family (even though some of them smoke), going out of my way avoiding acknowledging that I smoke in front of non-smokers, etc. I walked a half mile in the pouring rain at 1 AM last night to buy cigs, ran into another smoker who was there for the same reason, and smoked with him under the store’s overhang before walking back. Also it’s definitely affecting my stamina in bed...and I’m only 19.

I’m getting back on the quitting train and will be posting here again as I go. I feel less nervous about it this time because I know what to expect and that I can do it. But hopefully someone considering whether they can have “just one” will read this and save themselves the trouble.

TL;DR: You might think you can have “just one” after being quit for a while, but you can’t. Keep quitting every day.",27,0

I'll admit that I don't think that happens and I am okay with that. My mother quit for over 30 years now and she still has the occasional thoughts about smoking. Reading through this sub I get the same impression that the thoughts of smoking get more and more infrequent but never completely disappear.

There are still moments when I stamp my feet in frustration and think about smoking. During the first few days and weeks these times were more common and excruciating, but they slowly become less and less frequent and more and more bearable. Now, I am at the point where it only happens occasionally. It does get better and everyone who has quit is proof that you can do this too.

Life can be difficult for smokers AND non-smokers. Whatever tactic you've used to deal with stress in the past, whether it be eating chocolate cake or smoking a cigarette, does not have to be what you use moving forward! You've got this and I am so proud of all of our members ♥",17,0

For all you that have kicked the monster, I know this reads as ridiculous, sad, and pathetic as it does for me, now:

You didn’t really lead up to your quit, mentally this time. That’s okay. You know you want and need to. It doesn’t need to be a perfect scenario of finishing a pack at the end of the day. Throwing some out is fine.

You got to five days and you squandered it. You did this because, even though you were proud of yourself, the junkie thinking told you this is great but you want one more hurrah before you quit for good. You told yourself better to cut it at 5 days and start over than to get to more days under your belt and lose all that.

So you did.

Now you’re starting over again. It’s quit day. You’re a little drunk and you’re currently smoking, so you’re bold. The nicotine need is being met so you’re free to acknowledge that you very much want to quit, and you feel good about it. Good for you. You want this for yourself. You’re sure of it. You’re ashamed of yourself for failing. Ashamed of all of it. 

On Monday you will want to buy smokes. You’ve literally repeated this scenario hundreds of times. You quit on Friday. You don’t smoke all weekend, and you again but smokes on Monday. You say you’ll only smoke Monday. That becomes Tuesday. And then it’s Friday quit day all over again. Repeat til you die.

This next Monday will be different. It has to be different. If it isn’t you’re done, and you’ll never escape this. You’ve had all your one more days and one more weeks. You’ve exhausted them all, one hundred fold.

The mental and physical pulls of this addiction keep winning. It’s time for you to beat them. To punch the junkie thinking in the face. To accept the cravings as physical chemical programming, and at the same time ignore them. To overcome them.

You want:
-To live as long as you can, for your little baby
-to not feel ashamed for smoking and also hiding it from your wife
-to breath better
-to look and feel better
-to grow a beautiful black beard without yellow nicotine stains
-to feel good about yourself. Gain confidence
-to overcome a seemingly insurmountable challenge.

Read this on Monday. This is how you truly feel. This is what you want for your life and your family.",17,0

Had the dream last night.,"I have been a smoker for about 31 years, starting at the age of 14.  I have attempted to quit and failed several times in the past.  It's usually a few years in between attempts.  

Over the last few months I started to notice a few things.  A) My chest was starting to feel tight.  B) I had a ""dry"" cough, where I would hack and hack for several minutes to no avail, until finally I would produce something small, but then followed by at least 10 minutes of having to constantly clear my throat.  This happened a few times a week (I assumed this was the start of a smoker's cough).  C) Cigarettes really started to taste like crap, like I really only enjoyed a quarter of the number of cigarettes I was smoking per day.  The rest literally tasted like chemicals (I recently cut a lot of chemicals/unnatural ingredients completely out of my life) and I wouldn't even finish most of them. 

I kept saying to myself maybe this is a sign that now is the time I am supposed to quit.  Then I went camping with a group of friends over a holiday weekend where I proceeded to smoke almost 2 packs a day!  I felt like absolute garbage each morning that I woke up, but proceeded to light one up as soon as I walked out of the camper and kept going from there.  I told my friends during that weekend that I really wanted to quit, and soon!  My supposed best friend replied to the group with something like ""Yeah, we'll see.  She's tried before"".  

So with the signs my body was giving me and what I took to be a challenge from my friend I resolved to quit.  I saw my doctor a week later and asked about Chantix.  I waited for my insurance company to approve the prescription, went to pick them up, and picked a quit date.  I started taking the meds on 9/28 and had my last puff on 10/5.  

I signed up for Text2Quit & Quit4Life.  Then I found the Smoke Free app, then I found this reddit and signed up and I also purchased Allen Carr's book.  I even made a fake newspaper clipping of an article about my promise to quit and hand delivered it to my niece and nephew and asked for support from my Mom & Sister (both former smokers a long time ago).  With the Chantix and all this support (especially you guys), I feel great and am so proud that I am almost at the 2 week mark!

My cravings haven't been killer at all, more the memory/habit type and I'm already seeing the physical changes.  I have to wrap this up, but I did finally have ""the dream"" last night.  Even in my dream I was so mad at myself that I smoked and I woke up sweating and angry!  I know this is the one...this is the time that it will be forever, because what does a cigarette really do for you?  NOTHING, nothing, nothing!  I am proud to call myself a NON-SMOKER!  Not one more puff, no matter what!

Thank you all for listening and being there with your own stories and advice.  I look forward to reading them daily!",22,0

I truly don't remember when I started. I think it was an off-and-on thing from the age of 13. Now here I am, about to turn 30, with many quit attempts under my belt.  I believe the longest time was when I was on tour with my band. That was almost 10 years ago. 

I remember it was February, not sure which year. I signed up for a ""Driven to Quit"" challenge. It was a stop-smoking campaign aid provided by the Province of Ontario (I believe). Rules were simple; stop smoking from February 1 - March 1 and you had the chance to be selected to win a vehicle (after a urine analysis). Being my first quit attempt, I had no idea what to expect. Looking back, it may have been the easiest time for me. Hardly any responsibilities, playing music every day, hanging out with friends - it was an easier time. I quit then for almost 3 months with the aid of the ""Driven to Quit"" support group calling me every few days to ask how my tour was and if I was doing okay living in a van full of smokers. Long story short - I didn't win.  However, I managed to experience the longest amount of time without smoking in my life. Never thought it would be still, the longest amount of time i'd spend without smoking. 

I am tired of the strain it puts on my finances, my health and most of all - my family and partner. Well this time, the price isn't the potential loss of a vehicle, it's the permanent loss of me being able to say ""I haven't smoked since my twenties"". I am currently on my last 5 or so smokes. I am planning on kicking it before my birthday, but I have already succumbed to the dark, frustrating ritual of having ""just a couple of more"". 

Anyways, I am a long-time reader, first time poster here. I am looking forward to beginning my journey as a non-smoker.....in my 30s.

Thank you in advance for reading this. I need a kick in the ass and I know some of what’s written makes me look like a bad person and I’m aware of that. I’m just desperate to quit and need help. 

I’ve 26 and I’ve been smoking for almost 11 years. I smoked my first cigarette when I was 16 years old. I stole a cigarette  from my grandmas pack and smoked it in the back yard. I still remember that day so clearly. Both my grandparents ended up passing away from lung cancer attributed to smoking. Yet here I am years later still addicted to nicotine. 
My addiction to nicotine has been out of control and a serious battle. I’ve tried quitting so many times I can’t even count. This past year I decided I needed to make a change and ended up switching from cigarettes to Juul. At the beginning I thought I was making an improvement but I’m realizing I’m just as addicted if not more to nicotine now that I’m smoking juul. 
I’ve spent so many years hiding my addiction and not being true to myself or others. When I smoked cigarettes I hid it from my ex bf for almost a year. I’d hide my packs and when I didn’t have any left I’d wander around outside trying to find half smoked cigarettes to feed the addiction. It’s extremely embarrassing and disgusting but at the moment when I really needed a cigarette nothing mattered at all. My ex never once noticed or realized I was smoking. I couldn’t be honest with him or myself. But in a way I felt satisfied because I was able to get what I wanted which was nicotine. 
Years have passed and I’m still hiding my addiction from my current bf. We both openly smoked cigarettes for a while and he decided he would quit when he turned 30. He’s been successful and I’m proud of him. I picked up a Juul without his knowledge and it’s been that much easier to hide it all because I can literally smoke anywhere I want without him knowing or seeing. I feel like such a piece of shit. A liar and someone who can’t be true to themself or anyone else. 
This addiction has taken control of my life in so many ways. COUNTLESS times I’ve told myself tomorrow is the day I quit, but then make up a reason not to the next morning or even a few hours later. There’s days when I think something “bad” might happen or I might have an argument with someone so I decide to not quit until the next day. And it’s just a cycle of that over and over again.
I’ve thrown away my Juul pen only to buy another. I throw away pods only to buy more. There’s absolutely no self control and it shows in other aspects of my life. I’ve read Allen Cars Easy way and it didn’t help. I went to addiction classes through my health insurance and it didn’t help. I think about my grandparents deaths and still it won’t get me to quit. I think about how disgusting it was to pick cigarettes up off the ground and it’s still not enough. I keep waiting for a day to wake me up and give me a push and it’s not coming. So many times I’ve pushed my quit day to the next. I’m aware there’s no self control. What’s sad is that there is motivation like my grandparents passing away but I can’t seem to get myself to actually do it and quit once and for all. I just keep making so many excuses. Everyday is a new excuse. 
I hate living this lie. 
On a side note, I’m pretty sure it’s even effecting my sex life. Im no longer smoking cigarettes but I’m pretty sure the nicotine in the Juul has COMPLETELY depleted my sex drive. I have no interest at all in sex or masturbation. I’m a female and I read that it really only impacts men but I’m not so sure.

It's about making an executive decision. Making the decision to not be a smoker. It's as simple as that. And I haven't looked back. I honestly pity smokers now. They all look deeply unhappy. They're all weak.

Cigarettes stopped being fun for me when I realised the feeling was only ""good"" because I thought it was good. I could feel the most amazing pleasure in my body, but when I really thought about it, I asked myself, what about this is good?

It's honestly scary, the things we will do and the lengths we will go for a cigarette. It's disgusting and pathetic. It alters our consciousness and makes us a slave. It's a dirty, evil, disgusting habit. Cigarettes are toxic, deadly and rob you of your quality of life. They are fake happiness. I have no respect for smokers.

I’ve been smoking for 12 years. The most valuable part of this past month hasn’t been the deep breaths, the stomach improvement, or the vanishing mouth dryness; it’s been the gradually increasing confidence in my own ability to stand strong. Learning to breathe through cravings and get more and more sure that I could survive them. Disentangling the benefits I associated with cigarettes (getting a break from or postponing stressful situations, change of scenery, an excuse to breathe deeply) from the cigarettes themselves. Realizing what a horrifyingly perverse decision it was (Allen Carr’s book was super helpful for this) to conclude that, you know, hastening my death by literally paying to inhale poison gas was just the price I’d have to pay to do those things. None of us intentionally made that decision - we fell into it. But we can make the decision to crawl out. 

It feels so good, you guys. Anyone struggling or contemplating - you can do this. I promise. I’m so proud of everyone here, and so grateful to join you all in making a better life for ourselves.",51,0

I wanted to tell you my story with the issue of ""quitting"".   
I had to move to Edinbrugh for my university and in UK cigarettes are quite expensive. So I was planning on quitting months before this.   
A month before departing, I've met this girl, who's now my gf, that encouraged me a lot in quitting.   
I felt really confident about it, I was ready for it.   


It lasted a week, I really cherished the promise I made her about quitting, but i failed, and it killed me emotionally.   
I finished a pack of cigarettes in a day and I told myself that it was a mistake that I'll never repeat  


Yet, here I am.  
I kept quitting for a week, then back to a pack, then quit again until i took a pack of tobacco to cut the expenses.   


But now, after a week of smoking I'm tired.   
I'll see her for the first time in 10 days (we have a long distance relationship since I'm in Edinburgh) and I'm tired.  
I'm tired of keeping this secret to her, I'm tired of being a smoke addict, I'm tired of feeling weak and I'm tired of not being able to keep my promise to her.  


Tomorrow morning I'll throw my pack of tobacco away and I'll do my final attempt, I will never touch a cigarette again.   
I'm so sorry for keeping this secret to her and I don't want to tell her because I'm scared of the consequences, but I swear this time I'll stop and when I'll see her I'll be completely fine.   


Thanks to everyone who has read this 'till the end, your posts have been really helpful.   
And maybe I'll update my situation, but trust me, I'll do fine and I'm never touching a cigarette again.",7,0

I'm looking for a similar Android app for my dad. He's interested in quitting and because of the nature of his work (driving a truck he can smoke in 8 hours a day), he'd do better by following a preset schedule with notifications to have a smoke, versus opening the app and tracking each cigarette himself.

We are going with the ""flexible quit method"" on their website, mainly because it has the highest rate of success & we feel like that one will be best for both of us, so the idea is that 30 days after starting the prescriptions we should be smoke free, but still taking the meds for a full 12 weeks.  Here's some other stuff we are doing to help us be successful - anything you think we should add?

* Use the Smoke Free app
* Toss all ashtrays in the house & our cars
* Clean the hell out of the house & the cars to get rid of the smell as much as possible
* Avoid triggers (alcohol, etc)
* We both need to come up with something to fidget with to give our hands something to do, not sure what yet

I can quit and not smoke for a week, two weeks, three, etc. But every time something shitty happens or i'm stressed instead of relying on healthy comping mechanisms I reach for cigarettes. It's so stupid, because it makes me feel even worse and I know it doesn't help me but I just trick myself every time. And when i feel alright enough to not smoke I don't really experience withdraw symptoms or the need to smoke. I can even go for drinks without reaching for them. I'm just so over cigarettes and wish I could end this ones and for all, but I just don't really know how. So my question is if anyone has had the same experience and has some tips for me on how to deal with this. I just had a week without smoking, but had a shitty thing happen on monday and now i'm smoking again. After i finish this pack i really wanna be done with it and not just for a week at the time.

I used to smoke a pack a day. Marlboro Reds were my vice. It allotted me time to myself every half hour or so, even more on the weekends when I was drinking my brains out.   

  

When I first quit, the cravings were insane. You will battle that for a while. After the 3rd day, nicotine has entirely left your body. This is when it becomes a real mental game. You will have weak moments - maybe a bad day, an argument, or something set you off. You'll think that having a smoke will make you feel better or relieve this tension you're feeling. And that's when you need to be strong the most. I'd routinely have dreams where I was chain smoking, waking up in a sweat. Then smiling loudly to myself, knowing it was just a dream and that I was still going strong.  

  

A month will pass and you'll get the strong urge to smoke maybe 4 or 5 times a week still, but it's easier to manage. Where in the first two weeks it took some serious mental battle to keep yourself from running to the nearest gas station, here it will be easier. If you can make it to a month, you've done 80% of the leg work.

&#x200B;

For me, I realized smoking helped relieve my anxiety. It gave me an excuse to be alone with my thoughts - I was very much a social smoker but also heavily enjoyed being alone. I could never fathom being outdoors and striking up a conversation with someone if I wasn't smoking or drinking. Even now, I think I'd be better at it if I was a smoker or heavy drinker like I used to be. But the benefits of not falling it that category are tremendous. My body feels so much better. I can smell things again. Food tastes incredible now. I don't carry the stench of cigarettes anymore (the smell now repulses me actually and I can't believe I thought my bosses wouldn't notice when I snuck out for a quick drag). All around, life is so much better without smoking.

&#x200B;

So if you're reading this - keep at it and know it gets exponentially better. Make it a week. Then two weeks. Then a month, Then 6 months. You can do it, we all can.",16,0

I remember I started smoking the first time to cope with rejection, a relationship that never materialized because the girl I was involved with suddenly didn't want me anymore in my life.

All through these 8 years, I've held on to cigarettes as something which are always there for me. 

Since childhood, I've been a very insecure person. I'm a people pleaser and always available for anyone because I fear that people will abandon me if I don't take care of their needs. I'm a short, fairly unattractive guy. I don't have a multitude of hobbies, neither I'm very good at anything except for computers. I feel that nobody would ever like me enough to want to be with me and even if people come into my life because of some lucky coincidence, they'll figure out how boring I am, that there are so many far better guys around them, and they would eventually leave me for someone else. Right now I'm struggling with the same thing again, a girl decided she doesn't like me enough to want to be with me and just stopped taking an interest.

Here I'm again, holding onto cigarettes who are always there for me. If I quit, then I'll have no one to depend on. I know smoking kills, but so do people, at least they don't leave me.",4,0

Yes I'm not a smoker anymore. Yes it is a decision you take with no other option to fall back on. Cravings come and go at times you watch it slowly fade away at times you sense your body changes when you crave for one. It does not matter if your partner smokes coz honest to f***ing God I'm doing this for my future self. 

Yes I miss the habit of smoking at times but I can't have the consequences of the health it probably has already created double and tripled by 60. And without smoking my mom has some condition which will be triple fold with smoking. 

----- total venting below ----------

I went for a walk after ages, I woke up early after ages not coz I suddenly could do all this , it's because I want to do all this and I am tired of my excuses. I'm running out of time and without a healthy mind body it's very hard to live with your chin up. All the science points to exercise food nutrition for chemical changes In the brain. I can't sit around waiting for ideas to strike. I gotta move baby. Move and create, fill my time up with all the knowledge of what I want to create. Talk about it research it study it and do little by little everyday every moment I get .....away from the bread winning work :D 

Yes it matter we create, it matter even if it does earn shit. It matters because it's worth it. It's worth doing for one person or a thousand. It matters to show kids it's important to create and not follow the freaking rat race. We need to know we can dream and make it real bit by bit second by second. Question the rat race question everything it's okay to question don't try to just fit in. The fucking industries counted on us to want to fit in. See how well cigarettes are marketed. It's fashionable it's cool it's hip it's fucking addictive. All the kids who did not really fit in got in with this shit. No one tried smoking coz they wanted to. Everyone did it to fit in. 10 yrs 15 yrs 30 yrs later if they living they trying to quit it. Some quit trying to quit.... they just don't believe they can. That is the sad thing. You think the tobacco industry care that they crush people's will bit by bit over years  making them shrivel into their own little caves to of self doubt.  They don't. Coz by then they brand you as the fucked up person with no control of the self.

It looks like he was quite active on this sub and I wanted to let you all know to keep up the good work, because cigarettes killed my father. He wasn't feeling well for a while, and at the beginning of June he started accumulating fluid in his abdomen and after a liver biopsy, it was determined that he had cancer in his liver. After further investigation, cancer was also discovered in his intestines, and as you might have guessed, it all originated in his lungs.

The only problem I could see is that I might get depressed again, and my brain will trick me into thinking that I need the nicotine. now that I wrote it down here, I know exactly what to answer. No! The nicotine is what causes you to need the nicotine. So be happy with your life! You are a non-smoker, and you can enjoy life because of it. And have pity on the poor smokers who are enslaved to it.

I'm not sure if anyone will even read this and I'm not too fussed about it.

A bit of backstory

I've been a pack and a half smoker for the last 7 years. I have also vaped heavily in the past and chew about 20-40 nicotine gum a day. I chew nicotine gum at work constantly, one gum in, get the nicotine hit and then spit it out and repeat, i do this until i start to get a headache and once the headache goes away i start it up again. I smoke on breaks and when I'm not at work. I usually have a smoke every 30-40 minutes.  
I'm very addicted to this terrible substance called nicotine and I'm sick and tired of trying to quit only to start up again a week later.

This will be about my 15th attempt to quit this year. Although I have a really good feeling about at this time. I'm going to suck it up and just not do this shit anymore. This addiction has taken over my life. My life revolves around this substance.

I just had my last cigarette about 15 minutes ago. I rolled the fattest ciggie i've ever had. And now it feels as if a part of me is missing. But at the same time I'm glad its missing as i don't want to smoke anymore.

I'm going to be very active in this sub and come to in multiple times a day as i battle through the withdrawals/cravings.

I've read a bunch of posts in this sub and I have to say that you are all amazing. 94K people supporting each other day in day out, it's truly mindblowing. Each and everyone of you are amazing and i can't wait to be an active member of this sub.

Sorry for the rambling i'm a bit nervous about quitting but I'm not going to give in under any circumstances.

I love you all and i hope you all have an amazing day/night.

I'm off to bed. Peace all :) :) :)",31,0

I thought I would be more excited, it's such a seemingly significant milestone but really, it was just another day out with my SO, shopping, getting haircuts, perfectly normal. Nothing happened, it just so happens that a year has passed since I smoked my last cigarette.

I do remember that day though, or rather, I remember that evening. I’d just gotten home from work and, as usual, I hit the couch and started browsing reddit, r/all this time… and I just so happened on a post from this subreddit. I read it and it was kind of cool, I mean I’d fantasized about how cool it would be to quit one day and I’d decided to stop treating cigarettes with any kind of respect a long time before, but I never really had a well thought out quit plan.
 
One thing lead to another and I stumbled upon a mention of “The easy way to stop smoking” by Alan Carr. Now, I’d heard of it before but had always been skeptical of the possible results. Nevertheless I decided to give it a go. Reading took about five hours, during which time I smoked furiously but when I was done… I was done! I very distinctly remember crushing that last fucker and the determination I felt, the very vivid and profound feeling of freedom, I KNEW I was done, this wasn’t a try… this was it and I knew it that moment.

While smoking my last cigarette I thought about the thousands of others, the life I’d lived thus far for the past fourteen years or so, basically from one cigarette to the next, I remembered that one time I literally had to pick between food and a pack and well, smokers know it’s really no contest. I remembered that time after my dad’s heart attack when he could smell the tobacco on me and I told him that yes indeed I did smoke, I remembered my first year in college when I realized my best friend started smoking on the regular after I did, and I probably contributed, I remembered my mother’s face when she caught me in the bathroom, and many many other moments.

So now after a year, I was going to tell you about the ~8000 RON I saved by not smoking about 25 cigarettes a day (just over 2x mean monthly salary here in Bucharest) and how it payed for my computer, my Oculus Rift and my Thrustmaster T150, or for those who aren’t into sim racing, about the trip to Crete I took with my SO that cost about that much… But that’s really just accounting. I might have been able to afford either of those regardless, both would certainly have been a stretch. One other thing I remember is looking in the mirror at around 29 or 30 years of age and noticing I looked 40, sure I hadn’t shaved in a while and the hat was ridiculous, but really it was the wrinkles and the eyes, a 23 year old gasped a few days ago when I told them I was 33 and said I don’t look it, I didn’t expect it or aim for it but hey I’ll take it.

You know what though, the added savings and the obvious health benefits are really just a bonus to the fact that I’m actually free now. it’s not the fact that it’s been a year that makes me free, it’s that I chose to be free to begin with.",62,0

 My crew smoked spliffs I asked for weed only and smoked a little yesterday and today in the studio, we were recording some rap and to be honest I think I lacked some inspiration, I was hooked on tobacco for 2 years and tbh my lungs and body feel better, but all this weed and beer definitely made me feel more cranky and lost because tobacco became such a hard habbit. I guess I gotta let autumn be autumn and chill out, I feel like rapping tires me atm, making beats is fun though.. Don't know about hanging out, my mind is craving a spliff so hard or a cigarette after watching my crew sharin the spliff and smoking joints alone, though I'll give myself some time without nicotine because it's such a life sucking habbit and I feel too weak atm.

But srsly I'm left confused about my social interaction and losing so much focus on weed without balancing the edginess with tobacco. Stimulating myself on the haze. Or exercise by myself on just small ammounts of weed without alcohol.. Idk omg did anyone beat this shit? Lol.  Tl dr : For me smoking weed after quitting tobacco for 3 weeks feels a bit awkward, but the good thing is I think weed by itself is less addictive than spliffs for me, but I shouldn't make weed a priority like before.",2,0

It's been pretty brutal, up until the last few days, where I haven't really thought about it much at all. I remember reading in Allen Carr's book there will be an ""epiphany"" moment where you realize you are a non-smoker, and don't even think about cigarettes anymore, and it will be around 3 weeks. I thought I had that moment, until last night.

I had the strangest dream; I was traveling to London, and bought a pack of cigarettes for some reason, thinking I would ration them and enjoy them on my trip only. People kept trying to bum one from me, and I was hoarding them like Gollum and the ring. ""My precious!!""

Soon I looked in my pack, and there were only a few left rattling around, and I realized I was hooked again. I felt so much shame as I walked to the smoke shop to buy another pack, as that pack was supposed to be my ""trip pack"" and I wasn't going to have any more after.

My girlfriend was with me (who is a non-smoker and has been helping me quit). So I had to hide the fact I bought more cigarettes, and smoke in secret, and it was awful.

I woke up freaked out, it took a good 5 minutes for me to realize I hadn't actually started smoking again. I was relieved, but now all day, all I can think about it smoking again. I've had more cravings this morning than I have had all week.

Fuck you cigarettes! And fuck you too, weird brain! I'm sure I'll get over it, but man, this is one way I didn't think it would have a hold on me. It's like Nightmare on Elm Street, only Joe Camel is tormenting me in my sleep vs. Freddy Krueger.

 A friend of mine walked up smoking American Spirit blacks, and I bummed one off of him.

And it was fine. I probably didn't smoke another one for several months, but then I had and itch to smoke another. I went out to the bar to justify smoking one. I somehow trapped myself in the ""I'll only smoke when I  drink."" 

Not long after I found myself buying a pack. I didn't think anything of it because, it would be my pack so I didn't have to bum from anyone when I went out.

It's been about a year-and-a-half now since I lit that first cigarette in 5 years, and I'm back to about a half a pack a day.

Since the day that I lit that cigarette, I can speak with 100% confidence that every aspect of my life has been hindered by that choice. I hate smoking, but it has its claws in me again.

I'm not proud, but I am damn angry...

I have the weekend off this week, and come Saturday morning I will no longer be a smoker.

It can rear its head at any point, and in moments of weakness we do things that we regret. In our mistakes, we find resolve. 

So, stay strong. To smoke is a choice, and while there are addictive properties of the cigarette it all boils down to the decision we make to spark the flame.

I used to smoke a lot, the stronger the better, from filterless camels to players navy cut, but most of the time i rolled my own using golden virginia rolling tobacco.  I was the type of smoker who would snap the filter off a light cigarette to get a better smoke.

But on 8 August I decided to go see if I could go a day without smoking.  It was really tough, but I made it through the day.  The next day, I decided to push out for a week, with intention of starting smoking again after 7 days had gone.  I thought it would be a mini health drive, I wasn't looking to make anything permanent.

That week was awful, I was at war with my own mind trying to defeat the urge to smoke.  I was so shocked at how I had lost control of my own brain that I decided I had to continue until the cravings were gone.

Week 2 was more of the same - a mental battle against the cravings.  But from week 3 I had some really heavy physical withdrawal symptoms starting - I fell asleep randomly a few times, vomited (4 times), had mysterious pains all over that my brain promised me would go away after a smoke.  I couldn't drive a car for more than half an hour before the struggle to stay awake started.  Also my brain felt like it swelled up a lot, so I got some really bad headaches.

I have no idea how anybody manages to quit if they have symptoms like this. Fortunately, I'm between jobs, but there's no effing way I could have quit if I was working.  It wouldn't have been possible for me to maintain the high level of performance that a stressful well paid job requires.  I was pretty disturbed by the withdrawal symptoms, it felt like what I imagine quitting heroin is like.  When I checked on line, the symptoms were just about covered by the description of nausea and mild flu but only because serious flu = death.

The worse the withdrawal got, the more determined I became to stop.  It was after week 3 that I decided I  was going to quit permanently.  I'm not really tempted into smoking when I see other people smoking, and the rationale I use for not giving into the cravings is that having just put myself through weeks of hell, there's no point in throwing away all of that hard work and suffering.

Over time, the physical symptoms have gone down, but I'm not back to normal yet - I still have a swollen head, but I'm not getting urges to fall asleep or any weird pains or vomiting.  Although writing this has made me slightly nauseous for some reason.  Have almost stopped coughing up tar - the colour is a lot lighter.  Also I've added 10 kilos / 20 pounds which I'm really happy about as I was thin as a rake.

Just discovered this subreddit and I'm super excited!  It's really amazing what's going on here.  Thank you to everyone who is participating in this subreddit, it really means a lot and has had a big impact on me.

I've been on and off smoking for several months now, but I just hit day 4 and I'm done with smoking.  I feel good and confident and I know that I am powerful and strong to overcome this.I'm done with the shame and embarrassment of smoking or quiting, I'm done with this slave driver tobacco, and I feel like I have my freedom back. It's on.

I've been thinking about my previous attempts to quit: some lasted longer, many were shorter.  It's always a trigger for me, I guess pretty much everybody, that ends my plans to quit and I'm right back to the rat poison race.  Not this time.  This time the air is clear and clean and I'm not polluting myself with the tobacco companies' poison again.  That's the attitude at least.  So, I need your help with your advice on how to deal with triggers. Some of my most common are below, and how I might deal with it.  Any advice you could give in addition to or to critique the plan.  My apologies for the rant, I have to get some of this out somewhere.

1. When I get upset or angered over whatever.  It could be an argument with my partner, some jerk I'm dealing with at work, or just a bad day that can happen so many ways.  This will cause me to smoke more often than not.  My plan to deal with this is to stop and confront and ""upsetness"" or anger.  STOP. Take a moment and think about how powerful and strong I am to have handled the situation properly (may require my apology to the offended party).  If I am able to address this before letting it stew it will be great evidence of my ability to handle the situation.  My craving then, compared to the situation that triggered it, is minor compared to the power I have to solve it.   Part B of plan is to do some quick exercise like jumping jacks.
2. When my partner leaves town.  To preface this, I'm not doing this for her. I'm doing it for me.  But when she's gone I devolve into full bachelor pad mode.  There are pizza boxes everywhere, I just through my crap everywhere, and the house quickly turns into a disaster.  I usually do a college try clean up before she comes home, but it could really improve.  Anyway, I'll just smoke like a chimney when she leaves.  To combat this major bachelor pad mode trigger, I plan to text my partner about my successes not smoking 3 or 4 times each day she is gone.  Part B of this plan is to take my dog on a quick jog each time I would have otherwise been smoking a cigarette.

I suppose that's all I have now.  Thank you again for everyone who participates in this forum for the betterment of people, it's truly a beautiful thing.",2,0

But I am done complaining about how hard it is. I have had incredible support from people here and I don't even know your names! Yesterday was one of the hardest day as it was the first day back at work.  I stayed strong because of the support from the people here. Special thanks to u/fness_e for your encouragement yesterday. I realise that you are in the same boat as me and yet you were there to help and encourage another in need. 
Instead of being consumed by the withdrawal and fear of relapse I want my journey of quitting to also be of use to others who are struggling to quit.

So here is are my suggestions to those who are starting out:

1. Stay very active on this subreddit. Ask for help if necessary and rant out your frustrations here. This will be the single biggest source of motivation and support in your journey.

2. Don't quit without sufficiently getting enough information and having a plan to deal with the sh*tstorm of withdrawal symptoms (I made the mistake of reading after quitting). There is plenty of good information on this subreddit but I also recommend Carr's Easyway to stop smoking and Butt Out a scientific way to quit smoking if you already haven't read them. Easy way is easier to read and is mostly about changing how we view smoking and the social brainwashing. Butt out had more solid information and gets you to think about things to do in the process of quitting but it is at times very technical and difficult to read. Butt out also gets you to think about relapse more seriously so you will work to prevent it. Read these books in that order a few days before quitting. Stay away from websites trying to parrot ineffective public health policies or pushing pseudoscience. 

3. Once you smoke the final cigarettes, seek help once again from this subreddit. But make it a point to help at least one other who is seeking help and support here. I now feel inspired by members like u/fness_e and believe that being a quit smoking advocate is the best way to staying away from smoking. The more you help the more permanent your quitting becomes. 

I know I will have more difficult times ahead but I have crossed the line of no return. I am done burning my health, money and time. Thank you for helping me quit.",6,0

I'm on a plane right now, feeling like shit, we know why. After a five year break, in a helish evening two years ago, I took a smoke, and that was it. I've been smoking ever since. Turned to vaping for a while and kept trying to quit.
I'm an edict. I can't smoke two cigs a day. I smoke a pack. More sometimes. This needs to be done.
For the past month I had two good tries, five days each, and listen, they were awesome. Yes, I had cravings, yes it was hard, yes I didn't poop (#sorry) but the health changes were so immediate ans so intense I felt I was walking on air. I could breath, did not have to use my inhaler, my skin glowed, I slept so well, I did not snore, I was energized and happy. I did not constantly crave something, I was more productive at work and my partner was so happy. I smelled great and my yoga practice got so much better. In five freaking days!
This weekend I flew to vacation with a friend. I arrived as five day clean, and the first thing I did was take a cig from her. From that moment I smoked, let's say, a pack per day.
And, not surprisingly, I felt Un energized, slept so bed, felt like I can't breath during the day and night, used my inhaler super often. I was a mass. Yes, I enjoyed smoking with my drinks, but I did not enjoy the holiday as much as I could have.
I arrived at the airport now and walked into the open smoking bar, baught a pack, and with two drinks smoked like eight cigs in an hour.
I'm on the plane now. I feel like shit, my heart is beating so loud it feels like it's struggling, I stink.
This is the moment I need to remember, and this is why I'm writing this
It's basically to me.

Life is less good like this.

The points below are just what I've learned- it only reflects my own experience, views and knowledge.I'm no expert nor a professional of any kind!Nevertheless, I know sharing experiences and insights with others gave me the motivation and tools I needed in order to quit, and if any of it tick with you- I'm the happiest :)

**The Scientific side of addictions (at the current state of research):**

TL;DR for the paragraph below- addiction occurs when a certain **non-vital behavior** makes us feel **really** good, and our brain get wired to constantly repeat this behavior.From a scientific view- being an addict doesn't equal to being mentally-ill or weak-minded.On the contrary- it means crucial and healthy neurological processes took place in your brain.Addiction is a physical process which begins with you doing some behavior.This behavior registers in your brain as ""feeling good"" by causing dopamine surges (the ""reward"" neurotransmitter) in your nucleus accumbens (the ""pleasure"" brain-region).Another brain-region (the hippocampus) stores this good experience in memory, and another region (the amygdala) ""condition"" it so you'll repeat it.Dopamine interacts with another neurotransmitter (glutamate) to teach your brain that this is a vital basic need.At this point- it's not an addiction yet- it's only a feel-good experience registered.Repeating this behavior gradually wires your brain to relate a lot of stimuli with this feel good behavior solution, and to adapt to those high levels of dopamine and/or substance of abuse.Since the dopamine levels get so high with your addictive behavior of preferences- it tries to get ""accustomed"" to it and to ""normalize"" it by regulating it down.Every time you repeat your actions- you encourage your body to have more receptors and to build higher tolerance.That's where it also get compulsive- this process allows your nucleus accumbens (the ""pleasure"" brain-region) to get more in control over your prefrontal cortex (the ""decision-making"" brain region) in this behavior respect.To sum it up- certain behaviors/chemicals ""hijack"" some of your most important brain mechanisms and the more you repeat it- the more difficult it will be to rewire your brain to stop doing it.It's not because you are weak- it's because your brain is very strong, just in the wrong way...

**The more important part- the experiential side of addictions:**

For us addicts- addiction means none of the above.It means we have a wish to stop/reduce our addiction-driven **actions**, however we fail to apply that wish.

I think the key to understand why we fail to act on our ""will"" is to understand the difference between what we think about will, thoughts and decisions, and how it's actually experienced by us.

It's going to be a bit philosophical one- but I'm not going to dive deep into it, and it's only here to make a point:We think there is a higher level of ""me"" than the one in present- one consistent person that goes through life.We imagine we are that person, that we control it and that if we change that person, it will impact his decisions in all current experiences he might have.Climbing down from the philosophical tree to our actual experience- we think we can decide to quit smoking, and that that decision (with enough willpower) will make us decide not to smoke anytime a craving may occur.

We're all been there- that's just not how it works.  
You can't use this willpower because **it's not your will**.  
There is no higher-level you...   
As you know- your experience (think/feel/want and any other conscious function) only exist **right now**. **at all times.**  
You can remember your last-week self or plan your next hour- but you will only experience it now!      
That's the most-obvious point I make- but also the most important.  
If you decide to quit smoking- you are doing it based on your current experience.  
Withdrawal (starts a few minutes after you extinguish your last cigarette and getting worse as nicotine level drops) will lead to cravings- and then **your will change**.  
Sure- after you'll smoke one your brain desires will momentarily change again to not wanting another cigarette, but your willpower is so strong that the next time it will be a will to smoke- it will statistically make you to smoke eventually.  

**The most important part- what you can do to change your will at the present moment of wanting a cigarette to not wanting one:**

Probably nothing.  
Addiction is a powerful will-changer, and nicotine is one of the worst substances to be addicted to.  
Nicotine hit that craving-action-pleasure circuit so hard and so fast it's impossible to change your desire when you desire to smoke.

You may think there is your overall desire and there is your current experience desire and that they are two separate things.  
It doesn't work that way- when you want to smoke- that's your current desire.  
The other thing- is just you remembering you decide to quit from a time your desire was different.

My first actual advice comes from this concept- don't try to force yourself not to crave a cigarette.  
It's bound to fail and backfire.  
Feel your craving, allow it to drive you crazy.  
In fact- when you feel a need to smoke- force yourself to focus on this feeling, you have no idea how fast it will dissolve when you do.   
It can emerge again so quick you will think you want a cigarette all of the time, but if you let yourself really feel it instead of trying to move it away from your conscious you will realize those bursts of wanting are only a few minutes long.  
Even better- if you manage not to act on those bursts of desire, they will become less and less frequent.

But how do you manage not to act on craving when you have one?  
First of all note them- you will never succeed to separate the cravings from actions unless you note them as what they really are-  
a short burst of desire, that when prevented from being converted into actions- making you feel anxious, impatient and irritated.

That's my second actual advice- don't try to feel good, especially don't try to force yourself feeling patient/calm/focused.  
Do try to fake it as hard as you can toward other people.  
Withdrawal feels bad and there's nothing you can do about it.  
Just remembering it can go a long way with social interactions.  
Remember you can't really tell if you are angry on a person because you really are- or because of the withdrawal (even if you think you do- the things that will normally upset you are going to upset you even more).  
Try to go for a forced loving kindness and forgiveness towards everyone just as a percussion.  
I'm repeating myself with this point since it's a big one for me- dealing with withdrawal is difficult enough, the added stress by being angry on people isn't helping.  
This is especially true when dealing with those who loves you the most, but says all the incorrect things to a person in your situation ;)  
If they don't get you- be glad they don't know how hard it is to overcome an addiction, and wish them with all your heart they will never will.  
Be glad they think ""you just need to really want it"", even be glad they think you are weak, and that if they were you they would just decide to quit and that's it.  
It means they have never been addicted and they are your loved once so...   
Come here to your fellow quitters- open up an account if you are a passive reader- and just whine your ass up until you get the support you need.   
Remember how a few too many lines ago I claimed you can only experience the present? It's not entirely true.    
Our brain is a complex structure of neural connections, and when we remember things- we re-experience them in ""reduced volume"" mode- sometimes not enough to register in our experience as an actual desire as strong as the craving- but your brain feels it and running the ""quit smoking decision"" path.  
That's one of the most powerful tools in your bag.  
Every time you remember it- you make it stronger.  
Check in on this form as many times as you can, tell yourself why you want to quit all of the time- don't wait for a craving to do so.  
Even if you do end up lighting a cigarette- remind yourself before, during and afterwards you decided not to.  
Try to feel this decision.

Don't ever beat yourself up for remembering you decided to quit when you smoke!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
You can't win over if you say to yourself you are weak because you are making yourself weak!  
If you look for a way to always fail- just make yourself feel you are failing.  
Truth is- you don't.  
You are just a human being doing what a human-being brain doing.  
We think we are rational, but that's not even remotely true! Not even for the most cold-hearted, logical person you know.  
You don't smoke because you weighted the pros and cons and decided to smoke.  
You don't smoke because the withdrawal symptoms were that hard you couldn't take them anymore, it may be how you explained it to yourself and what you think you think/feel.  
Truth to be told- you are just smoking because that's the most prominent feeling in your mind **right now.**

Changing this experience is what recovery all about.  
At the end there is only one cure- and it's time.  
When you stop to feed this process- you are rewiring your brain not to experience those cravings. 

Remember you don't have to act on your cravings, it's really hard to do because acting on them feels good and not acting feels bad.   
So try to slowly help your brain change that fact.  
Whenever you cough or feel any smoker health symptom- remember your last cigarette- it will help you to associate the bad feeling consequences with the actual smoking.  
Whenever you feel good for any reason- remember you are not smoking right now.  
   
A lot of people try to replace the nicotine's induced feel-good with any other feel-good (food, sport, weed, anti-depressant drugs and etc) or to keep having it with other types of nicotine-drug-injecting-methods (E-Cigs, gums and etc').  
There's a lot of advice out there for and against, and I don't know what works for you.  
Just be careful- don't run away from a cigarettes addiction to a new one.   
Just remember that withdrawal is supposed to feel like shit if you got a healthy functioning brain.

Finally- a relapse doesn't take you back!  
So what? so you smoked one, big fcking deal.  
If it doesn't make you say to yourself you are a loser- you didn't lose!!!  
The progress you made is still yours, and every exprience you gained with this goal in mind takes you one baby step towards it.  
The most important thing to realize is that when you decide to quit- you don't decide to never smoke again.  
You decide to never give up to smoking without a struggle with yourself again. you can lose the next battle and smoke the next one- but you can never lose the war if you don't surrender...     
My biggest advise- when you smoke one- grab a pen and a paper and set your desires and priorities back in check.  
Then- **make sure you are doing everything you can to experience the next craving as hard and as fully as you can**\- you'll know what to do from there if you do- I promise!  


I know it's very long and it could be summed in 3 sentences- just wanted to explain the state of mind that worked for me as good as I can.  
Hope I didn't waste your time, and I wish you to enjoy your journey, but even more so- to feel it even when it's not fun to!",15,0

I quit about 4 weeks ago. I don't count hours. I' m confident it will stick, I can do this. 

Pack a a day for 38 years. Since 14.

I was a swimmer, above average lung capacity, always took pride in my fitness, felt it fade as time goes by, but most of all; I don't want to feel nicotine buzz. Sober is the state I want to be in, to know what I' m actually like in ""no caffeine, alcohol, pot, nicotine"" state.

Cold turkey is harsh, success rate 3%. Tied and failed. 

Asked help at my local Montreal hospital, this program has more chances: 

Patch 21mg/6 weeks, 14mg/4 weeks, 7mg/2 weeks.

Supplement with gum or nicotine spray, nicotine inhaler, give up favorite supplement at 6,4,2 weeks.

I found this to be rather easy compared to previous attempts, cold turkey and vaping.

My advice; when quitting, try to remain in the ""flow state"", don't take vacation, don't quit your job or do anything that will stress you out or make you feel under stimulated.

When we met, she only smoked when we went out with friends. She quit smoking for a couple years while we had our 3 children (7 y/o girl & 5 y/o twin girls) but now she's smoking a pack aver 4-5 days at work and in her car before she gets home because she thankfully won't smoke at home in front of our children. Her father died of cancer in 2012 and last year her cousin had to have a mastectomy. 3 years ago we had a major cancer scare when her mammogram showed a mass in her breast. Before we got the results back she swore to me that she was going to quit.

Since then, I've been standing back and passively supporting her while continually smelling the faint smoke on her clothes and tasting the gum masked smoke on her breath when we greet each other with our usual kiss. I recently confronted her about it and she got very defensive and told me ""smoking is a part of me and I cannot be myself around you because you don't accept my smoking"". Especially over the past few months, it's negatively affected our Marriage. This past weekend we got to go to another couples house for dinner and she asked me in front of everyone if she can go outside to smoke with her friend, framing me as if I was the overbearing husband not allowing her to smoke....

Last night she told me straight away that the more stressed she is the more she'll smoke so don't ever bring the subject up. I'm aware how addictive smoking is and and very concerned for her increased smoking and health degradation. She's developing neuropathy in her legs and finds it hard to sleep sometimes because of it.

I've quit and restarted so many times. I quit for 10 years when I got married in my twenties, and started up again with the next guy I dated. That persisted through my second marriage up until I got pregnant last winter. And I wasn't an angel in spite of being pregnant, I had a cigarette now and then, once or twice a month when things were hard. My husband never managed to quit entirely, though he'd move to vapes eventually, he was working at a gas station and it meant people were smoking around him constantly and he was always a foot away from that giant wall of cigarettes. 


So a few weeks in after my baby was born, she had a 7 hour shriek fest and I was all alone with her. It cranked my cortisol and by the time he got home I was shaking. He put a cigarette in my hand and ordered me to take a walk and have some time for myself. And thus, cigarettes became my calm selfish ritual away from the baby. 


I started like I always do, just one on the way to work and one on the way home. Then it was lunch time, too. Then it was breaks. At first I resented that my husband felt he NEEDED his smoke breaks when we were home with the baby but then I needed them too. Soon we broke our rule about smoking in the car because the baby wasn't in the car as much as we thought she would be. Then I started seeing ash around and on her car seat. Then I noticed my work clothes smelled like smoke. We were careful about washing our hands and changing our clothes before holding the girl- then I noticed my hair smelled like it too. And I was starting to cough again, in my sleep, and when holding my daughter. 


So we bought a carton during our last paycheck and swore it was our last. Until we ran out, then I bought two packs on payday. And he got one since he didn't want to wait until I got home to have a smoke. Our finances as we both get back to work and catch up on bills make smoking a major issue, and yeah yeah, it's unhealthy but mostly, we're motivated by money. So we agreed to quit. 


He left me the last cigarette this morning. I immediately felt panicky when I realized this was it. I wanted to compromise and get another pack. But I knew I was starting to rationalize smoking, and just kept getting ready for work. 


After I drove into traffic with the sun coming up, I lit that cigarette and a good song came on the radio. And I thought about my Dad, a lifetime smoker, who recently and only very very narrowly survived cancer. It permanently changed him, he's a ghost. And I'll probably lose him in another year or two when the cancer comes back. 


I'll be 42 in January. I had my daughter very late in life, and the difference in our timeline has been on my mind since I got pregnant. If I were to get cancer at the same age my Dad is now, my daughter would only be in her 20s. Way younger and far more in need of support from her family than I am now. 


I'm so afraid to ignore that again. To fall to temptation, the need for a break and a little bit of self abuse to rebel against my responsibilities. All the other reasons, vanity, pride, they aren't as important as staying healthy and alive for my daughter. But I know my addiction can blind me to even that, the most important thing in my life. 


So I'm here, and I'm trying. I'm reminding myself that it is not an indulgence nor is it self-care. It's a deadly relationship that works in the opposite direction of everything I've ever wanted for my life.

Background: I have always been a heavy smoker, due to this 90% of my friends and also smokers. I have recently quit smoking and made a concious decision to remove myself from my existing friend groups as it makes it hard for me to stay smokefree as I am really bad at self control, I have spoken with my closest friends about this and they're all very supportive.
I've realised I don't really know how to talk to people or make new friends if they're not smokers, i am and have been an extorvert all my life, but am starting to lack confidence in myself and feeling not myself as I've never been in this situation.
I used to connect with people by offering to go outside together or hang together to have a session and what ever, and never noticed this being the foundation of friendships I built.
My question is- how do I form deeper meaningful friendships with non smokers? What do you do with them? Its weird I have to put it this way as people are people and interests are the same, but for some reason I'm really struggling to find things to do or to say, to find common ground as I've never been in this position before where smoking isn't the 'main topic' or 'common thing we're doing'.
I guess smoking has always been very social where I grew up and my workplace.

And yet - I have two cravings I fear to death - walking from my car to the office on the am, and back to my car in the pm.

I did not even think about quitting when I saw Snus at my tobacco store.  I bought a can just to see what it's like and did not want to smoke anymore after two days. I literally throw my tobacco bag in the trash and haven't touched a cig or even thought about smoking since.

Breathing is already a lot easier, my skin looks healthier and I can smell stuff again. 

Of course it is not healthy either but it's said to be a lot better than smoking. Maybe you want to give it a try aswell.

To those of you who don't know what snus is: it's often flavoured, cut or milled tobacco (most commonly in small pouches) and you just put it under your lip or basically anywhere you want in your mouth. It's available in a lot of flavours and can be used for at least 20 minutes. As opposed to normal chewing tobacco, you do not have to spit. I immediately went from smoking 20+ cigs to 5-8 pouches a day which does not only make it healthier but also cheaper than smoking.",8,0

(but I am still struggling),"You would think that after four weeks the cravings and the urge to smoke would finally be subsiding. But (for me) they are still as strong as on day one (stronger than on day 1 on some days). I smoked for 40 years. When I decided to stop smoking I was a two pack + a day smoker. The thing I don't understand is this: When I finally quit, I was happy and sure about my decision. At that point I hated everything about cigarettes. The cost. The smell. The coughing. Always worrying about finding a corner to sneak off to to smoke when I attended any type of social event... I smoked my last cigarette on September 5th and I changed three things on that day. 1 - I quit smoking. 2 - I quit drinking (since that was a trigger for me to smoke) and 3 - I changed my entire diet to avoid gaining weight. Everything is going well so far. I have not smoked, I lost 8 pounds and life should be great... However, I have been fighting non-stop with myself for the last three days not to go out and buy just 'one pack'. When I quit on 5 September I decided I needed some form of support and that is when I found the Smoke Free app and this site. I have never posted here before and everything is a bit new to me. I was wondering if anyone else here quit smoking after so many years and if so, if they are having similar experiences as I am? This has to get better, right?

Accompanied by that was a feeling of remorse and shame.

I quit now for a solid week, which is the first in a long, long time. So yesterday, when I was in this craft beer joint and I didn't have any cigarettes, I thought I might relapse as people often do in these kinds of situations. But to my surprise, when looking around, I counted the people who smoked and it was only 3 out of approximately 30. I always thought this was the other way around. So there I was not smoking and actually feeling good about me. 

The same this morning: of course, I feel a little weary due to a couple of pale ales, but it's different this time. I can breathe quite normally and don't feel like shot in the head. So maybe I should continue this. And cutting down on the booze also seems like a good idea. it's just not so much fun without the cigarettes so why bother?

anyway, a long and sometimes confusing train of thought and also a long post, but I thought why not share this.",17,0

Except that once I go to bed, I’m a non-smoker. 32, female. I’ve been a smoker for 14 years. Pack a day habit for as long as I can remember. That’s 102,200 cigarettes. That’s 1,022,000 minutes I’ve spent smoking. 17,033 hours. 710 DAYS OF MY LIFE HAVE BEEN SPENT SMOKING. What the actual fuck. 

I’m on day 12 of Chantix. Flew right through the first quit date I set because I still had full packs from the carton I bought. I STILL have full packs and god it hurts to drown them but I’m gonna do it. 

The Chantix has been doing its job. Sometimes I get partway through a lit cigarette and put it out because I’m bored of it. If I’m just watching tv or reading I don’t get that jarring “have a cigarette” craving like I used to. The addiction/muscle memory/force of habit is stubborn though. 

My triggers are driving and my morning “me time” with a cup of coffee. The evening not as much since there’s dinner to make and things to clean and yadda yadda. But I would plan out smokes around how long it takes a pot of pasta to cook or if I should sneak one in before or after the sauce comes to a simmer. And I never ever ever went to bed before my bedtime cigarette. I’ve read about changing my routine to break the habit. Maybe sleeping in and taking my coffee to go will be enough. Maybe I’ll do some yoga in that morning hour. Video games with my coworkers on my lunch break. Finally learning guitar in the evening hours. So many options. But I know sitting outside chain smoking in the drizzle isn’t one of them anymore. 

I’ve been noticing the smell more. I get in my car and take a deep breath. It stinks... my phone case smells. My hair smells. My favorite jacket smells. I’m sure my damn shoelaces smell. Hell I’m sure the change jingling around in the bottom of my purse has found a way to smell. 

As a non-smoker I want to be a runner. I want to be one of those crazy people that can run a mile without trying to die. I want to date a non-smoker and not agonize over when to drop “the bomb.” I want my mom to be proud of me and maybe my success will be incentive for my dad (who is somewhere in the 50 year smoker range). I’m in a good place to do this. I have financial incentive, I have future (and probably current) health incentive, I have teeth and breath incentive. 

I have every quit smoking app ever made. I have paper straws cut to size if I need them. I dug my fidget spinners out of the bottom of my desk drawer. I have my favorite time consuming recipes to make for the next week. I’ve been saving Shameless on Netflix and I haven’t done my laundry in a week.

A few tricks to quit smoking, on day 1 brush your teeth when you wake up this way you don't want to smoke. Get plenty of water and your sense will become heightened. You will crave sugar, you will crave food, and of course you will crave cigarettes. You have to want to quit. People telling you should quit is the most god dam annoying thing out there.

Advices: rest, less caffeine (avoided irregular heartbeat today, we are more sensitive when we are quitting), avoiding arguments and blaming, avoiding alcohol at all costs (at least for me)

You may feel shitty, but remember it will pass, **you're doing a great thing for yourself and that wins all over this shittiness we are experiencing**, so be happy! If it gets very hard, it's probably a wave of your body cleaning itself  of toxins, your body is going to feel a lot cleaner after it passes. 

But there's this small trick I've remembered and thought about lately that helps a lot, Th**x** God!!! 

***MOVEMENT BRINGS MORE MOVEMENT***...

1. Tell yourself every day to exercise for a short amount of time (For me 10-15 minutes).  Small amounts of work are hard to refuse, personally I like outdoors way more than gym. 
2.  The important thing is to do it regularly, every day if you can. The brain is going to remember it and create new pathways just like it did with bad habits.  
3. You're going to find yourself doing even more than ''10-15'' minutes of workout because it feels nice and may get you a bit high, but exercise does wonders for our body and brain (even a 20 minute walk google it). If you strain yourself by working more don't get discouraged, tell yourself to do at least an extra small workout the day later (actually good for muscle ache relief) 

(I was so lazy today I asked myself how the fuck I'm going to do wood splitting this evening because it rained and I was fantasizing about weed a little , almost didn't want to go on a bike and buy myself some food. After going on a bike I biked more than I expected. But it made me breathe in the air and the same air was probably fuel for my cells and I got motivation for the wood splitting.)

&#x200B;

The thing about weed is everyone mixes it here with tobacco, really bad behaviour I mimicked. Even if I try smoking just pure weed, my brain has this strong association for tobacco and tries to lure me in.  My city friends are into stimulants and weed so that's also dangerous for me. I live in an old house have sinus problems and smoking anything just makes it worse, most of them are financially in a better situation than me and actually I might say that this poor situation I've found myself in was my teacher that got me sober.  Tbh I'm a bit lonely but I was also **even more lonely getting high** all day even among my friends and I **lacked focus and verbal skills**. I've had great times with weed, but I've also didn't do well in high school, dropped out of college, attracted people who pretended be friends just to smoke my stuff. Anyways painful but great lessons of life, someone also wrote **it ain't good to be looking at the rearview for too long if you're driving forward in life**

I must remember the day I quit tobacco that my heart had been pumping like mad even though I did a little bit of basketball by myself. My lungs and physical condition felt broken for a 21 year old , getting a lot better now, exercise and a lot of natural food and ***HOMEMADE GRAPE JUICE***(great for lungs and heart) without added sugar really did wonders!

I am here seeking advice as a child of a chronic smoker, not as the smoker myself. My mom was just admitted to the hospital for passing out as a result of a multitude of things. When she got a CT scan of her chest, significant damage to her lungs showed and the doctors obviously told her she needs to quit as her oxygen levels sit around 84% without the little oxygen tube. 

My mom is in a bit of denial about her smoking and the harm it’s causing her. As her daughter, i’m just so concerned. I’m not judging her or her habits, but she refuses to quit. I understand addiction isn’t easy but nothing I do or say will change her mind about it. I’m in the health field and have been telling her these things for as long as I can remember and i’ve tried the “tactics” I’ve learned in school about how to help someone quit smoking but i’ve never encountered this and it’s a bit harder because she’s my mom. She has COPD, but that doesn’t seem to concern her either. 

I’m truly at a loss. At the rate she smokes (1.5-2 packs a day), she will eventually need to get procedures, and she will need oxygen constantly, and hopefully nothing worse. If anyone has any idea on how to get the ball rolling on helping her quit or explaining it to her in a way that will make her understand, please please reply.

This is my very first post but I've been lurking this sub for more than a year and I want to share my story.

Around a year and a half ago my now ex girlfriend and I split up after almost 7 years of relationship, as you can imagine, I was devastated even tho it was a mutual decision, I started drinking and smoking like there was no tomorrow, my job involves a lot of traveling meaning at times I was alone in a different city drinking and chain smoking my sorrows away.

This started going out of control pretty quickly, so after almost two months of ""partying"" like a rockstar, yes, it involved drugs, alcohol, sex and of course smoking(sounds fun, it isn't, really) I decided that I needed to move on.

I started reading about addiction and installed the smoke free app that I once bought in one of my many attempts to quit before, I never felt that I had an issue with other drugs (mainly MDMA and weed) but I knew tobacco was my real problem, I was right. 

As you know, the app recommends this sub and a few more resources in order to help with the whole quitting process. What helped me the most was the app itself and Allen Carr's book, so I set a date and made sure to stay focused on the goal.

I quit on the September the 30th, 2018 at 9p.m. I still had a half pack, after reading the book, I knew what to expect but I didn't throw it away, I am a software developer by profession, so I ""played"" this game where I was catching myself craving a smoke, recognized the feeling, embraced it and decided that was the perfect moment to ""refractor"" the connections in my brain for that specific moment, and lo and behold, craving by craving, I finally was able to spend an hour, a day, a week, without thinking of smoking.

Not gonna lie, there were times when I thought ""just one puff, do it for the good ol' times"" or ""if I can quit for two months this easy, I can do it again after this party"", but I know it doesn't work that way, I know ""just one puff"" will be the slippery slope that gets me back to where I was before.

I moved countries 6 months ago, and guess what I found while cleaning my old flat? Exactly, that half empty pack with a note to myself that I wrote when I quit: ""pain is temporary, glory is forever"", cheesy, I know. 

But it is true, I've come a long way since then: I haven't smoked a single puff, I haven't taken drugs either, I do drink alcohol from time to time tho, I broke all my personal records on the gym (I can deadlift 200 kgs now), I'm learning a new language, started climbing again, I'm almost done with the 16th book this year. 

I want to thank you all, I learned a lot from all of you, I stopped coming to this sub regularly after around 3 months, when I noticed I wasn't thinking about smoking all the time, but I always come back when I have that weird craving that hits like a truck. (at some point I didn't see the pokemon guy but there is a new one now :3) 

I know I have to be vigilant all the time, I can't allow myself to get back to the person I used to be, I'm doing this for myself, this is, without a doubt, the hardest yet the most fulfilling thing I've done in my life, I know this is something I put myself into and as such I have to deal with the consequences and that's exactly what I've done for the past year. 

For all of you that haven't quit yet, know life is better once you are free. 

For all of you that quit already, stay quit. 

And as cheesy as it sounds, yes: pain is temporary, glory is forever.",22,0

I thought I could take one light puff, but no matter how long I quitted it (2 month max), and no matter how gross it felt to my mouth, the habit kicks back in. Also, I admit that I'll crave for cigarette forever. Some told me they completely forgot about, but now I know I'd want to smoke a puff forever any day any time. So, again, once I'd take a puff, I just don't know when it'll end. And it can't be at hospital or anywhere like that.

This one book helped me a lot on this take. After a numerous tries, while it does ask for effort, I got comfortable quitting it for a couple of months. However I just couldn't give up the smoking experience. So I asked for help in this book to sort out and face the situation while seeing where I got to go. It wasn't light material but it did shocked me that this smoking habit that I got is abusing my life in every ways. And it also showed me where I'm going and how exciting and realistic it should be when I fought it in right way.

In the previous tries, I was always trying to overcome myself and be stronger to fight with the addiction. Turns out surrender puts me in better state of mind. It's a bummer that I'm not good at handling this certain substance, and I can't forget. However I suppose this would be a good journey to improve my life and whatnot.

\--

I'm writing this out on day zero. Started from the last night, morning was fine, feels like cravings would hit me every 5 minutes almost all day, though I know it'll stay down as time goes by. However I'm cautious enough that I cannot overcome this inviting feeling for cigarette this time. One day at a time! Just 5 hours more to finish this first 24 hours, and then feel that I'm living the different life since the yesterday.

I feel like I can do this 365 or thousands of days to come, and finally I'm focusing about what to do rather than what I missed and how scary it would be to be with or without cigarette. I guess I became more self-centric by surrendering.

It's just day zero and there is nothing to tell or brag about, but I thought it was good idea to tell if there were people checking out on this sub with previously failed attempts. I guess somebody needs 3 tries, and hopefully it's just 7 for me to realize (whether by oneself or with friends, books, professionals) that it's just good to 'give up'. Cheers for glorious day!",3,0

I decided 8 days ago that it was time to give it up. Smoking has been my coping mechanism for the past 12 years, my excuse to escape the stress and take 5 minutes to step away. Originally started as a way to get a break at work when I was 16, and that mentality has been with me since.

I am now 8 days smoke free (not nicotine free yet, am using gum). I dont particularly feel better but the habit is entirely selfish and so far my motivation for stopping has been entirely selfish, focusing on what I could buy with the money saved. I dont want to fall back into it, by deciding one day what I'm saving up for can wait or isnt needed.. So, I decided the money saved throughout October by not smoking will be donated to mind.org.uk.

Hoping that by focusing on what I can give to others, will keep me from the habit long enough to no longer feel like I need it.

Posting so that its public and as official as my little pact with myself can be..

I have this headache I almost feel as if it was stronger I would go insane or something. Actually minor migraine, mostly left side of my head I think.. it feels swollen from inside lol

Though I'm really thankful and my I'm slowly returning my condition, I'm soon going to fix up my teeth, a beautiful girl ran in the park and smiled at me a few times, I don't care if I'm going to be with her, but it made my day, also exercising, food and water always almost always helps with feeling weak and it reduced my lung pain today by a lot, but my head hurts a bit (more oxygen or wtf?)... Maybe I shouldn't have drank a beer and 50-70mL of liqour on Saturday evening...   It surely didn't help but I'm still fighting but I'm really confused about these headaches, is it really from the quitting tobacco or is it my house...  Also didn't smoke weed for 30 days

My mother used to have headaches and I thought she was a bit annoying by her nature, but idk... :/ I've had some headaches before I smoked, but they were small, I think smoking really brought allergies and bullshit reactions to an already poor home I'm living in.   I will move out soon and finish my game dev course in another city or be somewhere else so my health doesn't rot here.    Thinking of quitting coffee for my teeth and anxiety too.",1,0

yesterday I cycled 20km and felt great afterwards. no nausea, no breathless. just strong. and now, seeing 1 month in the app plus all the Health benefits i have received give me a motivational push.
