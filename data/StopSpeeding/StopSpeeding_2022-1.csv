I am stronger than I think I am. 

I will have bad days, hard days, exhausting days, just like the rest of society but I can get through it without drugs. 

Emotions are more overwhelming. The good emotions are so much sweeter without drugs. The bad emotions are so much harder without drugs. Remind myself-It‚Äôs part of being human, to really feel, to not be numb. 

Energy levels are coming back. I do still nap for about a hour every single day and some days I feel more exhausted than others but slowly I am regaining more energy. 

I still think about drugs everyday. 

It‚Äôs okay to feel bored and restless at times. Slowing down is okay. 

Food taste better, relationships feel deeper and feeling more at peace. 

This journey has been so tough but so rewarding. This group has helped me a lot on the hard days and I am grateful.

I‚Äôve been prescribed amphetamines for about 10 years now and can‚Äôt remember myself NOT on it. I mean I can, but it seems like a wholly different person.

I was consistently abusing my already moderately high dose prescription (currently a revolving door of 40-60 mgs of Zenzedi/Dextroamphetamine/Adderall depending on the availability), especially taking it while drinking or socially.

Long story short, I just quit 3 days ago. I was out of meds early anyway, have been thinking about quitting for a while, and it just seemed like the time to do it.

As expected, I‚Äôve been very sleepy and kind of irritable but nothing I can‚Äôt deal with. What I‚Äôm worried about is going back to work tomorrow; I‚Äôm in HR for a large healthcare system, and my job is built almost entirely on communication and interpersonal relationships. I‚Äôm worried I literally cannot do my job without amphetamines. I‚Äôm worried I won‚Äôt be able to do anything (see friends/family, do shit with my toddler/be a good mom, essentially anything that requires me to be‚Ä¶me).

But I‚Äôm really, really scared of work and finding out I can‚Äôt do my job unmedicated. That I‚Äôll lose it. And I‚Äôm the primary breadwinner and this anxiety is almost unbearable.

I hit a hard hard bottom with those substances and went to IOP, I just have never wanted to revisit that kind of self destruction ever again. 

Weed and alcohol have been harder to build up time on. I started going to AA a few months after that Jan even though I never identified as someone who had a problem with drinking. I knew for sure I had a problem with drugs, but not really with alcohol. It just felt like the right crowd to try out sober living with, bigger network of people in my city. Ive for sure done some things im not proud of when ive been drunk, ive worked through that with the steps and in therapy. I just don't know. I think I have a mental obsession now around drinking because ive been conditioned to think that abstinence is the only way im ever going to be a good person or successful in any form of sobriety. Ive read some other posts about shaming in AA, and I completely agree. I feel like the whole thing has been one colossal mind fuck. Would I have been fine with alcohol if no one had ever introduced that program to me? 

I don't know. I guess im curious about if there are people who are clean from stimulants but still drink recreationally or even smoke weed recreationally. Im trying to get some more information/think/talk to my therapist more before I make a rash and regrettable decision.

It became problematic when I began abusing my script of 30mg a day, and would be having about 60mg a day (occasionally up to 80mg), only for my script to run out, and go 3-7 days completely off them like a zombie. After abstaining completely from March 2020 to June 2021, I used Dexedrine sporadically between 10-15mg - about once every 3 months -  from June 2021 to January 2022.

Since January 16, I've been using Dexedrine every day - initially 15mg, but the past couple of days it has been 20mg. I know this isn't considered script abuse, and it has genuinely helped with my ADHD tendencies, but I know it isn't sustainable. It is losing its effectiveness, and I know if I want it to be effective again, I'll have to either up my dose or have a ""no med"" day which will make me completely lethargic and unproductive. No longer a mild euphoria, it's now at the point where they are making me feel ""normal"". I've realised I experience the same level of anxiety/paranoia when I was off Dexedrine, however Dexedrine makes it feel more 'concrete' and compartmentalizes it, which makes me become anxious of the anxiety.

I'll have to pick a weekend where I am doing nothing to go the first two days off them. I'm not going to beat myself up over it: I lasted so long before hand, my use is currently mild, and I remind myself why I decided to go on them in the first place (I recently moved house, and I have no doubt I'd still be living in a house of boxes if it weren't for the medication).

But I don't want to go back to who I was when off them, as I fell into dopamine seeking habits like porn addiction, internet compulsion, binge eating, and video games. I want to use this time on 15mg to continue learning new habits and embrace living alone. But I managed to do this while doing my Masters and working full time.

I keep seeing this situation as lack or white: be on Dexedrine and semi-productive beyond university and work, or be off Dexedrine and live a life of work/uni/be a zombie. I hope there is a third way, and I think that's learning new habits so I don't go back to the old habits when off them.

Ill try to keep my story as short as possible. Ive been taking adderall for the past 5months.  I started taking Lexapro May or June of 2021 for anxiety and depression after going through a divorce involving my 5yo son. It was tough to say the least. In September of 2021 my Pdoc put me on Adderall after I complained about my lack of motivation and tiredness on Lexapro. My anxiety was still around on the Lex until I started the adderall. The adderall completely killed my anxiety and gave me the motivation I was needing. At first it seemed like a god send. But as time went on I feel as though I have started to lose myself and now the anxiety has started to kreep back in. I feel extremely numb and have lost interest and love for things I normally have. So I have now decided to come off of both the adderall and the Lexapro. 

I started adderall at 10 mg daily and have increased over the last 5 months. I am now taking 20-30mg daily for the past month sometimes up to 40mg. I haven't really abused it as I am prescribed 40mg daily. I have had a couple 2-3 day breaks over the last 5 months but have taken it more days than not and have taken it every day the last month.  I have been on adderall before, In middle school d aily when diagnosed with ADHD, not sure how long but my parents eventually took me off. Again in my 20's (37YO now) for a year or more around the same dose I am on now. In my 20's I took M-F rarely on weekends.  I remember the withdrawal was bad in my 20's but cant remember as a kid.  I have noticed since taking it this time with Lexapro it doesnt seem to have as stong of effect. When I started the adderall I was on 15mg lexapro but the adderall helped my anxiety so much I have weaned down over the last couple of months to 5mg of lexapro. Should I get off the adderall first or the lexapro first ? How bad & how long would you expect withdrawal from adderall to be given my length of use and dose ?",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9985881447792053}"

I just want to sleep and people will say ‚Äútry this or that antidepressant‚Äù ; I‚Äôve tried plenty of them and they don‚Äôt work for me.

My boyfriend uses meth and because of his severe ADHD and it helps him a lot with his work and mood. I have schizoaffectjve disorder so for the past decade I've been with him I usually only do meth once in a while, and I typically stay in a good enough headspace for it to not be an issue.

About two months ago I got my first job in years and it's been great for my mental health and I have more Independence. However, the past 3 weeks I've been using meth on my off days, which are frequent since I have a 2 days on 2 days off work schedule. I found myself using so much that my boyfriend said I either need to learn to work with it or quit. So I tried experimenting with doing a small amount and going to work. It was awful, I felt like all the customers could tell even though my coworkers said I was fine (they thought it's the schizo). I decided I was using too much too frequently and that I didn't want meth to be part of my work life so I decided to quit and try to relegate meth to only being used once in a blue moon. But I think I took too much too frequently for too long and it's going to be way rougher than the first time I quit where I had the freedom to just slept for a week.

I'm scared. My coworkers are going to know immediately and I know some of them are going to say something. I'm afraid I'm going to be in pain at work or something worse. I don't know if I can prepare myself enough to get ready. I quit meth two days ago and I work today.

So basically i stopped doing any sort of drugs like 2 years ago and since then i thought a lot about my drug usage and how it affected me and everyone around me. My initial reaction was guilt about it because i lied used all of my savings lost the job and almost uni etc.

&#x200B;

The thing is that all of this true and i made a mistakes but recently i started to remember other things my memory for some reason didn't brought up until now. Like my childhood friend who took my videocard and drm ""to play"" pubg since i didn't need it right now and then later sold it as i found out year later. He at first pretended like he didn't remember so i guess without me telling about this i wouldn't get at least some money back. Guys ""Forgetting"" that i landed them money or remember less of it. The guy i was partnered at work basically abused the shit out of me then i relapsed and cut my salary in 20%. The thing is that he used that relapse as a point why he should get paid more even after i was one year clean. We split up later and now I'm doing even better at a job. At first i thought that he tried to motivate me that way but now i realize he just saw an opportunity and that i wasn't capable to stand for myself back then. My own mother still uses my past drug use as an excuse for her shitty behavior towards me. And i won't even tell how random people treat drug addicts i guess u all know that.

&#x200B;

Idk i can continue with that but i think you see the point here. Honestly it wasn't even the evil drug addict stealing shit out of everyone but a lot of people taking advantage of my situation: ""Friends"", ""Drug friends"", police, drug dealers etc. Fuck i didn't even stole anything for 3 years of usage and burned all my savings and my income and that's it. Honestly then i actually sobered up it becomes kinda sad to realize that nobody really gave a shit about it and for some people it would be even better if i still was tweaked out.¬†  


I wish i had that supportive cycle of people i keep hearing about everywhere but i really didn't. I only got some sense of understanding in recovery communities and maybe some ex-users and that's it really. I'm doing really good right now but i feel very isolated in ordinary life because of this experiences.

My 14 year old daughter has seizures that sometimes cause her to fall down. If no one is near her (and often, even if they are), she runs the risk of head injury when the seizures make her drop. That fact is a major reason why she is now required to have a 1:1 aide at school, per her IEP. 

I paid over $300 to hire an advocate to attend the IEP meeting. Money well spent, because for the first time ever, the IEP is personalized for her needs with tangible goals that make sense. Unfortunately, we live in Nevada and have one of the worst school districts in the nation.  

The district's staffing shortages affect all students. Yesterday it affected my daughter. Her life skills class was walking from the school to participate in Community Based Instruction. During the walk, she had a seizure and ended up falling into the street and hitting her head. 

She has a skull fracture. There's no sign of brain damage and the injury could have been way worse, but we're still at the hospital because she won't eat or drink anything. This is typical of her when she's sick or injured, she's sleeping it off. 

I was strong until now. Now I'm falling apart. I knew getting clean wouldn't solve all my problems, but it was a problem I needed to solve. Right now though I feel so alone and depressed and I hate myself. 

She has a roommate at the hospital that is seriously injured. She's fucked up. But hearing everything her parents are doing, all the things they're supposed to be doing, has reminded me (not that I ever forget) of how much I've failed my kids.

Social isolation, lack of emotion, hyper focusing on articles thinking I'm making some grand discovery, yo-yo dieting etc... The changes were very subtle and compounded overtime, until one day I looked back and realized how much this drug has destroyed me. 

Really what is the difference between taking 20mg or 200mg a day? In the end the problems are the same. Dopamine receptors downregulate, more dendrites form. Your body has now adjusted to the additional dopamine and you're back to square one. 20mg for ADHD or whatever becomes useless and you need to take more to achieve the same ""therapeutic"" benefit. Its not sustainable but doctors prescribe it like it is. 

I really believe no one should be taking stimulants long-term or daily. But it seems most doctors don't tell their patients this. Reading posts on /r/ADHD comparing Adderall to ""glasses"" or ""insulin"" is insane.  Now after stopping, I see ads on platforms like Tiktok promoting stimulant use for ""people who cannot concentrate"". And the cycle continues... its really disgusting.

I think the body just goes into fight or flight now following abuse, even if my use is within the theurpetic range.

To be specific, The past 5 days I have had 15mg of Dexedrine IR. Last week was two days, and the week before was one day.

Okay so about 2 years or so ago. I had a friend who had left some adderall at my house awhile back that he was getting prescribed at the time. I took one of the 20mg tablets he had and that‚Äôs where my addiction started. Adderall felt like something I was missing from my entire life. It gave me social skills, confidence, and led to me to learn new things about myself that I never knew. It also helped me with my music. I would take 10-20 Mgs and I would be up until sunrise writing music and creating beats. Overall the drug made me feel like a superhero.  Until I would say about earlier this year (February) my problem had worsened and now at this point my tolerance is thorough the roof. I can recall a time I consumed about 60mg and felt no effect other than insomnia but without the euphoric rush of energy I was use to that would keep me busy all night being productive. But this isn‚Äôt my problem. Around this time I noticed I lost my ability to produce a rock hard erection. I would like to add in that watching porn and masturbating was one of the activities that I frequented while on adderall. My sex drive used to be through the roof. Almost concerningly high at times but now that hasall changed. It has been a few times I can remember having sex with a partner and not being able to get it up but those few times seemed to have been temporary while It was in my system. 
Now it has been at least 6-7 months I have refrained from taking adderall but yet I still haven‚Äôt been able to get horny like I used to and get a full on erection. I would say the most erect I get it about 70% of its full potential. I hardly wake up with morning wood anymore and like I said if so it‚Äôs not what I‚Äôve know it to be. I also don‚Äôt get those unwarranted erections that men sometimes get throughout the day when they see a nice body or have a thought. In addition to all of that I have lost ambition and motivation to make music as much as I was. But that is the least of my problems 

Just a few extra details. I am a 25 year old male. 6‚Äô1 and 160 if any of that matters but I‚Äôve also went to the doctors office a few weeks ago and ran blood tests and t levels and things of such. Everything came back good and my doctor says I am only 25. Basically brushing it off but this problem is very alarming for me. I hope that someone will read this and being able to offer some insight for me.

So I started using meth (smoking) recreationally about 4 months ago, after trying it at a sex party. Following this, I got into a relationship with a daily user, which resulted in me going on 2-3 day binge every 10 days or so when I was with him. Alongside the meth I would dose GHB as well. Following these, I would always go home, come down, and get on with my life. I started a phd around the same time as first trying meth, and I had generally been managing to work on this as well as having days out for binges. 

2 weeks ago I went on a binge whilst I was with him, but for the first time, I ended up taking some home with me and carried on using on my own for 4 days, with some GHB use when I get anxious or rattled. When I‚Äôm using, I‚Äôm not functional, so I didn‚Äôt do anything at all during that time. Other than binge watch tv and go on my phone. 

I have now been using daily for 10 days and don‚Äôt seem to be able to stop. I know that 10 days isn‚Äôt long, but I also just cannot seem to not pick up the pipe when I wake up. I keep saying ‚Äúanother day and then stop‚Äù or ‚Äúgo until the end of this week and then stop‚Äù but it keeps happening.

It was an on-and-off affair at first to help me with university work, but it became something else entirely. I started abusing it along with alcohol and pot. Two months ago, 10 years into my addiction, the cycle had just worn me down so much that I just didn't want to be alive anymore. For two weeks straight I had told myself, ""Tomorrow you're going to stop taking these pills."" And for two weeks straight I still took those pills, feeling immense guilt, shame, and self-hatred every time. I actually ran out a week in to these two weeks...so I ended up stealing ADHD meds from someone close to me to get the addiction alive. 

By the end of the two weeks, I found myself in the lowest place I had ever been, and goddamn have I been in some low places before. But this was different. I just had this knowing fear that I was on the cusp of where this addiction to ADHD meds might turn into something more sinister (as in seeking out and getting addicted to harder drugs). I had been fighting with this problem for 10 years and just couldn't bear the thought of having to deal with it for another year or 5 or 10 or the rest of my life. I wanted out. First, I mistakenly welcomed thoughts of ""I wanted out"" to mean that I wanted out of this life, but upon further reflection I realized that what I really wanted out of was this position I had found myself in (addiction). 

I was depressed and down and feeling hopeless. I was going on a short family vacation for a couple of days and decided that I would leave my pills at home rather than take anything with me. I was hoping to use this family trip as a detox. Before I left, I bought a journal and a pen to write in every day to better connect with my feelings and the foundation of my addiction and trauma. I also downloaded an audiobook by Russell Brand called ""Recovery: Freedom From Our Addictions."" That was one of the best decisions I've ever made in my life. 

From the introduction I knew it would be something special. I know Brand isn't for everybody, but his book is so grounded and relatable and understanding of the way that I feel, especially when it comes to addiction, that it really began latching itself onto my thinking. I could go on and on and on about all that I've learned from this book, but I think it'd be better if I let you experience it yourself. It helped me stay sober for two months and gave me the slight push to begin meditating daily, journaling daily, reading Stoic philosophy daily, and setting up goals for myself. 

Two days ago, I found myself desperate for stimulants. I had one too many job rejections, my injuries had begun to pile up (from overtraining) and I just wanted relief somehow. In desperation I went searching in my room in case I had any pseudophedrine hidden about. Yes, i was desperate enough that the miniscule stimulant effect of sudafed was my addict brain's holy grail in this moment. And I found it. And I held it in my hand for a long time, mulling over the pros and cons of taking it. I ended up throwing it away and not taking anything. I ended up journaling and reading Stoic philosophy. I ended up going for a walk and relistening to a chapter of Brand's book. All I know is that 2 months ago, I would have taken it without a fight. But that day I put up a fight and won. And dammit does it feel good. 

P.S. I'm not trying to say that this book will solve YOUR problems, it might, but it also might not. I think the bigger thing here is that I didn't expect an audiobook to have this much of an impact, but because I was so desperate for help and open enough to whatever knowledge came my way it did. 

P.S.S. I also wrote a lot more than I initially intended lol so thanks for reading if you have the time and I hope this post can help you in any way.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8835021257400513}"

I lasted from March 2020 to April 2021 without taking a dose of Dexedrine, and then ended up having 10mg-15mg Dexedrine when university became overwhelming: April 4 2021, May 1 2021, August 21 2021, and September 21 2021.

I feel apprehensive to use the term relapsed since I was genuinely diagnosed with ADHD and, more recently, with atypical narcolepsy, however the past week I have used 10-15mg on every second day following complete lethargy once I moved into my new place. For better and for worse, I know Dexedrine gave me energy and made organization significantly more easy. I don't regret it, because without it I suspect I would still be sitting in my new lounge room with boxes and bags every where.

Certain ADHD tendencies have been curbed, yet there is still a subtle anxiety/self-consciousness that I recall turned into full blown paranoia in 2019 when I would binge my script. I am not concerned this time I'll binge my dose; I currently appreciate the current dose where I can still feel human, yet mitigating ADHD habits which have resurfaced during the pandemic. At the moment, I feel I recognize the difference between chasing an amphetamine induced euphoria and genuinely treating ADHD.

But my biggest is concern is the 'off' days or that they will lose their magic again to the extent the ADHD tendencies will no longer be curbed. I'm also reminded Dexedrine kind of kills the intuitive/unconscious mind, and I think my short term memory is better off them?

Is this sustainable? Worst comes to worst, this is a very mild ""relapse"" and there will just be a couple of days of mild tiredness. Or is this more of an issue if it results in full blown abuse?

Edit: If this isn't sustainable, then this is just a mild bump on the road of abstinence! :)",3,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9966520667076111}"

I‚Äôm 19 and I‚Äôve been on a year long routine of taking addy almost everyday. i had my breaks where i had to wait for my plug to get the script filled. or just took a couple days off because i knew my body was starving and sleep deprived. In the beginning it was great, i was so productive. My room and bathroom was always clean. Felt like i had my shit together. I was taking one 15mg ir a day.

Its like your trying to fill this hole and you think once you‚Äôve done all your ‚Äútasks‚Äù you‚Äôll be happy. Eventually i was taking like 60mg ir a day and went to the emergency room for a kidney infection. I was drinking 2 monster ultras a day and 60mg addy. It started to get to the point where i‚Äôd see outlines of people in the dark trying to grab me while my eyes were shut and trying to sleep. It felt so real and terrifying. I‚Äôve always prioritized my sleep so i never had 2-3 long binges. but i‚Äôd go to sleep and wake up early as fuck completely unrested and go on with my day. then i move in with my plug. Now i have my supply all the time. Taking 100-140mg ir sometimes. It got so bad i‚Äôd be uncontrollably shaking at work while having a panic atttacj under my mask.

Even if it‚Äôs not meth‚Ä¶ im doing exactly what my stepdad did before he went into a 3 year long drug induced psychosis and destroyed everything he ever worked for. Nobody even fucking knows how bad it is. I hide it so well but im fucking dying inside. I miss myself. I miss caring about what people had to say. I miss not caring if i was getting shit done or not.

Help with body recovery as well. thanks!","So I've been an addict for a while, I'm 19, turning 20 in 2 weeks. Teen years ive spent too much time deep into my addiction, not really tryna live through my 20s high the whole time, like I have my teen years. I'm over it. Currently my drug I'm using is Meth.

History:
14.5-15.5: constant weed smoking.
15.5-17: daily constant binge drinking.
17-18: rehab, completely sober at a boarding school.
18-19:daily constant binge drinking.
19-19.5: daily constant smoking fentayl.
Last around 7 months: daily constantly meth smoking.
Somewhere in there: 1 month of constant 3meoPcP abuse.

The overall takeaway from my lil history report is: for the Past 5.5 years, 4.5 of them were spent on drugs, the last 7months of which were meth.

I went to an intensive lockdown rehab for a year when I was 17, I have all the skills I will need to stay sober and not relapse if I really commit. Will probably goto meetings.

So my questions:

-What have I possibly done to fuck up my brain development, since the brain continues to develop until 25y. Especially, what I've done in the past 7months from the meth usage.

-are My dopamine receptors fucked? What may be wrong with my brain that is due to the drug abuse? Will my brain recover eventually? 

right now i am very unhealthy
I do Very little of the following:
-sleep
-eat
-drink water
-brush my teeth (I am going to get checked up by dentist soon)
-excercise

-to return to my healthy body, first I need to get back to normal, with doing all these things daily, BUT  what else do I need to throw into my daily life to return to normal health quicker? Multivitamin of course, and what else?

Also, I know this will be extremely hard for me to stay sober now, but ya gotta do wat I gotta do I guess..

I've been in a relationship for 4 years, we're living together and I've been using in secret, about once or twice per month. Unfortunately (?) though, my amph guy is in hiding, so I've substituted amphs with meth for the past three months (both illegal where I live). Great, innit? Also, I haven't done stims for 10 days now. 

**Anyway,** with all that out of the way, here I am tonight. My gf went out with her mates, I'm not working tomorrow so I had the *brilliant* idea of doing some meth, play some games but mostly watch porn. The desire was strong, it obsessively clogged my thoughts for an hour before she left. So what if I don't sleep tonight, big deal! So what if I'm a cranky and shitty boyfriend for the next week? So what if our relationship has been kinda shaky recently because of my dysphoric sorry ass? Pfffft, worthy sacrifice!

Yet... I didn't do it. As I write this now, a couple of hours later, I realize with insane clarity how fucking ridiculous all these wicked plans would have been if I had executed them. These drugs are horrifying tricksters, they confuse me and promise me glorious fun but they haven't actually delivered half of what they advertise with their twisted little voices in my head. Especially meth compared to amphs. The desire to use it is way stronger. It's actually scary. 

However, I'm gonna go to bed tonight and I'll sleep peacefully. And I hope I don't forget this next time I find myself in such a situation. Thanks for reading :)",20,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9557621479034424}"

i just feel so stupid for letting myself be consumed by such a mild stimulant when there are people sweating buckets, hallucinating, spewing from withdrawal and praying their addictions away (especially since i‚Äôm able to last the four days or so without it until i get restocked). i know it‚Äôs unhelpful to compare personal problems like this with others but i really struggle to take myself seriously and talk to anyone about it because i feel like it‚Äôs not severe enough to warrant concern from others. a substance that has the potential to help me to be the best i can be yet i choose to use it in a way that hurts me over and over again.",9,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9981856942176819}"

After trying it twice with friends I find out my ADHD head feels this majestic tranquility and it's awesome to get things done. Here it started.  


At first, it was 20-40 mg a day, then it got to 40-50 within 2 months. I started to notice that in the evening or when I did skip a day or two I've felt drained out, unmotivated to write even a short replay to the friend. That scared me and I started trying to quit. Got on antidepressants but as always after a month I have not felt any different from what it was before (was my third time trying different meds of this kind). I was sad that the happiness of the first month on antidepressants has gone once again and I started taking amphetamine together with antidepressants even though multiple people including my psychiatrist warned me that it's dangerous.  


I was trying not to do it on the daily basis, settled around once a week or even 10 days. But because of that, I was trying to get the most of the drug in the short periods I was accessing it. It got really heavy from this moment. Getting just 100 mg for a day was enough for the beginning, but then it got to getting high and not sleeping 2 nights in a row using up to 600 mg in 3 days.   


The autumn was about to begin. The year was tough in a lot of scenes but the beginning of September was the grimiest part of it all in terms of what was going on in my life. I was trying to endure it by myself but then I just could not. I started amphetamine on the daily basis again to get all the things done but it was making me hysterical at the point as well as I was getting more and more things to do. I also got off antidepressants due to some circumstances.  


Starting September 25 till December 23 I was getting it in about 160mg a day except for when I was getting a week off here and there a few times. I was worried for my heart not be okay getting painful feelings in the chest. (Recently I've got to the cardiologist and everything is perfectly fine which made me so happy.)  


At the beginning of December when I was actively trying to quit my friend recommended me Bojack Horseman and that was therapeutic and good. Like really good. And I started trying to be sober getting from December 23 to a day before yesterday without anything.   


I'm not ashamed of relapse because I'll just get sober again but fuck the first hour of the usage I was thinking how do I live without this feeling of this calmness and concentration. Then I felt like shit for 24 hours till now because it's always been a price to experience this crippling anxiety for a few days. It was difficult to believe that life without amphetamine can be anything but this was a couple of months ago and now I know that it'll be back to normal after a couple of days.  


Except that my normal was an apathy even before this drug and antidepressants were not helping me, I tried a few. And now this *normal* after withdrawal compared to the normal before feels like the yellow grass where the garden of wishes and feelings once prospered.   


What time do I need to wait till it gets better general? Can I speed up the recovery period somehow? (Rehab, for example, pun unintended) I'm trying meditations and that was progressing good till I forgot a couple of times, was ashamed to return to them for a week, and here I am :) And is it possible to get the life to the place much better than it was even before the abuse? Because from what I've read up to only 94% of the receptors are to recover and I was not happy with what I had to begin with.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9535145163536072}"

Update: I am now 26 days clean! I want to thank this community for being supportive and non judgemental. There are people in my life that I cannot talk to about this. Very happy for the person that suggested the discord because that was a big part of my sobriety. With it being my first time I was both afraid but curious like a cat. 

Going to take this as an experience and learn from it. Some things that happened during trying to quit: relapsed a few times, the ritual of it and the different ways I could use was, to be honest, exciting; I tested positive for covid with symptoms and it may have helped me quit actually. I have since then separated myself from the person I tried it with and said I would not be doing it anymore. No cravings but it feels like my ADHD has gotten worse. Had to restart all my meds because I was so sick with covid I literally could not get out of bed for shit. Today is the first day taking my Vyvanse again and I notice some improvement. I did let my doc know I stopped taking meds but did not mention meth use as I am afraid of not being able to take care of my ADHD properly. 

Although I did not get the usual experience from this drug I do want to say that I have respect for it now and will respect it from very far away. All the things I heard about it and the way it sneaks up on you. Damn. I can see partially why it's hard to get away from it. I have respect also for those trying to quit.

I have chosen life over this dreadful chemical romance. Our affair must end. We are like fire and gasoline, I am now good for you and you're not hood for me. At the dawn of the day, you only bring me tears and sorrow. Tina, free my mind and soul from your fist. I will miss you dearly, but this nightmare must end.

I finally dropped kratom, delta 8 and nicotine this year, but besides a one time 4 day addy binge in 2020 I hadn‚Äôt used addy since 2015. I also hadn‚Äôt used anything hard like opiates, coke or mdma since 2013.

So while I know OTC things like nicotine, kratom and delta 8 most definitely affect the brain, it‚Äôs been years since I was a regular hard stimulant or hard drug user.

Right now I‚Äôm mostly off everything.

But I literally cannot function. I‚Äôm brain dead. I‚Äôve been so used to for so many years taking a hit or taking a line or something before every task. I go days without going for a walk, days without making one phone call I need to make, sleep so much it‚Äôs depressing and when I know I need to muster the courage to get on the computer to fill out a job application, it‚Äôs like my brain explodes because there‚Äôs no brainpower to even open the computer.

I know it‚Äôs a common and valid discussion but in someways overly simplified to point to a faulty reward/dopaminergic system now, and I know it‚Äôs equally common for there to be positive stories about people improving and people crawling back from nothingness to have vitality as months add up. AND I know there‚Äôs no cheat codes - that doing something like work actually is supposed to be hard and uncomfortable

Stopped using opiates and drinking almost 3 years ago and I don't really miss those other substances I use to use everyday at all and damn near all the people I ran with are dead or in prison now so thank God I'm still here and free my life really hasn't been to crazy since leaving opiates behind but I use meth every single day and really don't want to. I feel as though I don't have a chance. I've tried to get clean more times than I count and have had some decent amount of clean time here and there utilizing 12 step programs.just over 2 years before my last relapse. I've followed all the suggestions and it really did help me understand myself and resolve some family issues and overall just kinda in a way assured me I'm not worthless trash like I had thought all my life before. But I never felt like I fit in with any of those people. All the time I spent in meetings and around those people I never felt comfortable around any of them and really gave me a shit ton of anxiety. Overall my happiness never improved and I got tired of feeling the way I did so I go back to meth. I don't go crazy with the shit like I see alot of others do probably because fucking doctors have been feeding me speed since a very young age. I pay my bills I go to work everyday I have a dog and nice things like guitars and bikes that I don't sell to feed my addiction like I did with heroin. As far as I can tell the only negative effect it has on me (besides physical health) is a big one. It is basically a ball and chain restricting me from doing anything I want to do. I have to stay in this area because this i where my meth is. I have to stay at my job and I'm afraid to travel because I'll have to take dope with me wherever I go and I don't want to go back to jail so I'm missing precious time with loved ones, which hurts me badly. Them as well. It's preventing me from growing. Just turned 30 and I know if I keep using this shit I'll wake up one day 50 years old and in the same exact spot if I'm lucky..... Speed is like my lifeblood unfortunately it's the baseline on which I operate. I firmly firmly FIRMLY believe that my brain does not and cannot produce much feel good chemicals because it's relied on capsules and in recent years crystals to produce them for the better part of 20 years now. really isn't working much anymore.

So I read something about how there is an acute and a subacute phase to withdrawal from crystal meth. The acute phase apparently and generally is supposed to last about 5-7 days and includes all those symptoms like extreme lethargy, fatigue, increased appetite, etc. But it seems, at least for me, that the subacute phase, which continues on for the next two weeks or so, is when the cravings really pick up, become more pronounced, range from some pokes and naughty little thoughts to full on romanticized reminders, graphic images, and an eventual fully convincing and seemingly diplomatic narrative that reads something like ""speed is the only thing that can fix the way you feel right now. You could pay your bills, do your laundry, catch up on all those calls, emails, and tasks that you've been avoiding. You could even invoke the energy to get in the shower, do your makeup, plan appts for the week, apply for some jobs, and have a reciprocal conversation with a loved one in which you sustain the emotional energy to provide them with support and presence instead of being distracted with an exhausted inner dialogue of shame and the classic tyranny of 'shoulda woulda couldas' "". So what do I do? I cave because those grooves in my brain or so deep, so entrenched, that I feel the gnawing pressure will only be relieved if I ""just one more"" the fuck out of my day. 

When you guys get to this point in the withdrawal process, what helps to interrupt this inner dialogue or put out the flames of self-denial and rationalization that perpetuate this nasty cycle? I know there is a prolonged withdrawal phase beyond this, and I don't think my knuckles can get any whiter.",19,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9974358677864075}"

I have been taking Zenzedi/dexedrine for a little less than 2 months now, before that I was sampling different stimulants with my doctor for approximately 1 month before finally landing on dexedrine.

3 weeks ago, I decided to take a 2 week break from medication after I noticed my dosage becoming less effective to see if I can reduce tolerance before making any other decisions.

I noticed around the 1.5 week mark after stopping my meds, I began noticing a weirdly restless, icy-hot, numbish sensation in my feet, which would then turn into a need-to-stretch sensation that would also spread to my hands and upper back/neck. I then remembered feeling this occasionally whilst coming down from my medication as well.

Needless to say I didn't worry too much about it so I went back on the medication for 2 weeks.

After the two weeks I decided to take another break. It is now day 10 of no meds, and the RLS sensation unfortunately peaked to very concerning levels last night when I was trying to sleep. I felt this insane need to stretch my legs and upper neck and just move myself aggressively. The sensation persisted in my feet and now in my hands, lingering on to a mild degree as I type this now the next day. Just from what I researched, it fits the description of RLS very well based on anecdotal accounts.

Just from the newbie neuroscience I looked into, it kind of makes sense. RLS is suspected to be caused by low dopamine levels, which is why it happens during opiate withdrawal. I figured it could also be caused by stimulant withdrawal, since stimulant withdrawal seems to sort of cause the same lower levels of dopamine as well. It also makes sense why restlessness seems to dissipate whenever I do go ON my meds.

You will... it‚Äôs far from easy, but if you go in with the right mindset, I promise you will succeed. I‚Äôm almost 5 years clean from meth. Here‚Äôs a little update as to how things used to be and how they are now.","Boy, I remember those first couple weeks. Those urges to use, bargaining with myself‚Ä¶ ‚Äújust one gram, then you‚Äôll be done.‚Äù I was using 1-2grams of meth a day, stealing to support my addiction.. breaking into sheds, houses, and garages. I burnt every bridge I ever made, and when my name was brought up, the first thing that came to people‚Äôs minds was meth. I wasn‚Äôt even embarrassed, I just didn‚Äôt care. Looking back, I was a piece of shit.. people deserve better, and I gave everyone the worst of me.

That way of thinking almost killed me. What saved me was realizing that I want more from my life. I‚Äôm still a person, and I was going through a rough patch, and yes‚ÄîI was destroying my life. I want relationships, friendships, family. I WANT to pay bills, work for and earn what I have, and not rely on stealing to support my next bag of crystal from the dope man.

Those first few months are HARD. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I don‚Äôt blame any of you for relapsing‚Ä¶ but what I will promise you is that it does get EASIER. Your mind will eventually go back to what it was before the addiction (I hear many of you asking this question) and when it does, it‚Äôs FREEDOM. It‚Äôs amazing. It‚Äôs inspiring. Don‚Äôt worry about recovering psychologically. You will achieve steadfast happiness, likely within 3-6 months of being drug-free (: 

Once you get back to that mindset from pre-addiction, you‚Äôre golden. Just make it a few months and believe in yourself. Stay away from bad influences, do whatever you need to do. I replaced meth with coffee, I worked 2 jobs and went back to school, and I was upfront and open about my cravings with my friends and family, and they saved me from countless relapses.

Focus on building a strong support system. Take it one day at a time, and you will make it! I promise you will. &amp; the things you can accomplish once you beat a stimulant addiction are ENDLESS. People don‚Äôt realize how much willpower it takes to overcome amphetamine/methamphetamine addiction.

I‚Äôm 24, and I threw away ~3 years of my life from my meth addiction‚Äîbut it made me stronger. I went back to school, and I‚Äôm about to graduate. I‚Äôve never been more proud of myself. It‚Äôs an amazing feeling, and it‚Äôs so worth it. I promise you this much.

I‚Äôm always here if anyone needs some advice, wants to be friends, or simply wants to talk about meaningless shit. Please feel free to reach out. I‚Äôm here for every last one of you, &amp; for people in every stage of recovery from this horrid substance. Love you all",37,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9903021454811096}"

And during my 20s I've managed to build really strong bonds with the best friends I could ever wish for. I was never afraid to share anything with them and was always able to count on them when I was struggling or looking for support. We always came through for each other. 

But in the 4 years I've been struggling, not once did I mention a single peep about it to anyone. I've been on a train that only leads to either jail or death, and it's been speeding up since it started, but not once did I ever consider to call up a friend and give just a hint of what was happening. 

A few months ago I was catching up with my best friend and in passing he mentioned that his new girlfriend is in NA. Today I randomly had the impulse to text him and ask for help in getting myself to a meeting. And now I have my first meeting scheduled. This is the first thing I've scheduled in 4 years. 

It's a strange feeling. At first it didn't really hit me; It didn't feel like I took a big step. But after a few hours I felt this tremendous relief, and excitement and optimism. Suddenly I find myself going through my contacts with an overwhelming urge to tell more friends. Fuck I wanna tell the whole world what I'm going through. 

But now, whether I like it or not, shit just got a lot more real. I can't hang out with people and lie and pretend that life is peachy and that I'm the fucking man anymore. They know that I'm an addict, and that I'm struggling. They know I took my first step to recovery and will want to see me take another. There's so much hard work in front of me, and I can't pretend anymore that there isn't.

For the first time, I've identified myself as an addict to other people. Addiction has always been a huge driving force in shaping my life, and now it's a defining part of my identity. For the rest of my life I will identify as either an addict or a recovering addict.

Passing thoughts of doubt, to intentional silent prayers, to finally mouthing the words to quit in the mirror. And then admitting to my SO out loud that I want to quit in 2022. My little secret was hidden to all but her. Took a year to go through those motions. That was hard, but extremely liberating. 

I remember the first pill I took, I was 18 in a college dorm. I couldn‚Äôt believe that kind of power existed in a tiny blue pill. Boom instantly hooked. But I also couldn‚Äôt see how far that rabbit hole can go. I hear it‚Äôs bottomless. 

I‚Äôm 27 now. With a very steady access to unprescribed adderall due to college town access. I used adderall all those years for leisure, but when the world shut down in 2020, the addiction got worse. I didn‚Äôt need to be around people, so I didn‚Äôt really need to be physically intimate with anyone. What was once a month, became once a day. For 2 years. 

I used it for everything. I hit milestone achievements in ranked online games, I renovated my home by hand, I masked my painful depression, I built my own business from the ground up (working 70 hours a week is easy if you have speed). I‚Äôm an engineer. Boom boom boom go go go. 

But now? I have literally no friends. Maybe 1, not sure I‚Äôd have to ask him. I‚Äôm a religious guy who hasn‚Äôt seen a church altar in years. I was an athlete but haven‚Äôt lifted a weight in 3 years. I love to do creative writing but I don‚Äôt give my brain the chance to wander. Humorous moments escape me. Invites go unanswered. My body weight has actually gone up from booze and bad food. I don‚Äôt leave my house, like ever. I‚Äôm very thirsty. This isn‚Äôt woe is me, it‚Äôs just the piper being paid. I don‚Äôt hate myself, but the little pieces that make me who I am, I‚Äôve made second in priority. That is what you lose. For me, losing the pillars of my identity was slow and gradual. Hilariously ironic. 

So, I‚Äôm done. I haven‚Äôt lost everything, fortunately. But I‚Äôm tired, man. I‚Äôm scared to give it up, it‚Äôs going to be a real shock to my system. I‚Äôm fried, tired and ready to feel again.
