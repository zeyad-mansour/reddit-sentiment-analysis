Our official sobriety date was May 9th. It all ended on August 9th, when we decided to ‚Äúhave a beer‚Äù and watch the Dodgers game at the bar. We had beer occasionally, like once a month, but I got a wild hair up my ass and drank four. Halfway through beer #3 i was texting our old dealer. 

In four months of being almost completely sober, we went from sleeping in a homeless shelter to renting a beautiful house, two cars, working steady jobs, nicotine free, gym every day at 5am, church, and more that we never even dreamed of. There was an elderly couple from our church that wanted to buy the house we were renting from our landlord, so we could do rent-to-own. It was a godsend because our credit is horrible. Like lowest 7% in the US. WE WERE GOING TO OWN A HOUSE.

We were only going to sniff it, only one night (it was Saturday) and then sleep it off Sunday then go to work Monday. My drunk ass decides to pick up a hitchhiker on the way to pick up, she was obv tweakin and long story short: she offered us clean needles. Which we accepted. 

Kind of a blur from there but we were so high that we (in this order):

-sold my truck for a third of the price I paid for it -bought a 1990 dodge cargo van to live in and travel, cus we lived in a small town and had to run ASAP
-returned the van the same day to craigslist sellers because we were paranoid it would break down (took a $200 loss on it)
-quit our jobs via vague text
-lied to landlord and the elderly couple about having a family emergency so we could ghost them
-missed out on a once in a lifetime rent to own agreement
-6 hour drive up the coast took us a week 
-spent over $2k on hotel rooms
-have been buying meth from homeless people in every big city to keep us going
-got ripped off three times but did it all anyway
-finally got some slightly above average shit and now we‚Äôve been stuck here in Seattle for a week getting more every day
-ran out of money yesterday and had to pawn our Apple products for more meth
-spent all the money on meth and now we will be ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù in the car tomorrow night like the fucking idiots we are
-all my veins in my arms, hands, and feet are gone which has been really uh... stressful to say the least 
-both of us lost 20 pounds and we weren‚Äôt fat at all before

All because we wanted to have a fucking beer and watch the game. For me, it will never be one night of sniffing lines. One beer feels good so of course I want another, and down the rabbit hole I go. I‚Äôm not distraught about it any more. I had a lot of feelings of remorse in the beginning but now I‚Äôm just numb. Not sure where to go from here but hopefully I make it out alive. Lol

I was diagnosed with ADHD nearly 4 years ago, when I was 42. I was on Prozac at that time due to anxiety. After several months of Ritalin LA and then Vyvanse - I decided that I didn‚Äôt need the Prozac any longer cause the ADHD meds literally made my anxiety disappear. And I didn‚Äôt want to be taking two psychoactive meds.
Long story short - over time I ditched the Vyvanse and switched to Adderall instant release. Never took more than 20-25mg a day (5-7.5mg every 3-4 hours) and even quit completely for 3 months. I always took a 1-2 day break every week or two, cause Adderall really messed with my sleep and cause extreme nicotine cravings.
I‚Äôm on such a break right now, it‚Äôs been 4 days since I took any and I want to stay off.
First couple of days I was very tired and depressed, crying a lot and feeling horrible. Now the fatigue is gone but I‚Äôm SO irritable and angry. Adderall really helped me regulate my emotions and made me the patient, calm mother I really want to be :( 
Now I‚Äôm snappy, impatient and feel agitated.
Is this the withdrawal? I really hadn‚Äôt been taking high doses and almost never more than 7 consecutive days.
I‚Äôm worried that this natural me. Prozac had helped with irritability and short temper, these are not new to me.
I also supplement a lot. L-tryptophan at night, magnesium. Saffron in the morning, Lions Mane, fish oil, b complex, vitamin D, cut cumin and more. And I‚Äôm on a ketogenic diet.
I just want to be happy and energetic yet calm and patient. 
I never took Adderall for a high or for studying. It was mostly for situations that are overly stimulating and for the calm.

Many times I would re-dose until I vomited only to continue redosing. Of course, I never realized how harmful this behavior was until quitting, though now I have been left with some rather uncomfortable feelings that I can only lessen with alcohol.

Essentially, for the past few weeks, I have been experiencing the most horrific paranoia (more so than the random anxiety I had on occasion whilst high). I have this deep-seated feeling that people I have encountered in the past are plotting to ruin me, that cameras are watching me, and that I am generally being observed for whatever reason.

I recognize these feelings are crazy, it just feels so incredibly real and I'm wondering if these are the manifestation of some kind of withdrawal. I also abused MDMA fairly heavily for a period of two months and am wondering if anyone has had any similar experiences from speed that they could share, and how long it took to recover.

I was prescribed 36mg of Concerta for around a year and a few months for Add Inattentive/OCD. Once concerta started having more side effects then benefits (ie Intense anxiety to the point of hair loss and depression) I was switched to vyvanse for a few weeks.

Vyvanse only furthered my anxiety and gave me a constant sense of impending doom. I was convinced my bus was always seconds away from crashing and my surroundings were slowing closing in on me.

Needless to say I quit all stims, including coffee and cigs. Ever since then I feel depersonalization, and maybe even depressed. I say maybe depressed because I've forgotten what ""normal"" feels like. Its been this way since I quit in December.

This whole experience has really degraded my personality, I've become such a negative person. I've only in the last few months been able to cry, emotions feel blunted. It's like I'm viewing the world through an old TV.

Why is this such a massive, permanent trigger to me?","It's been 107 days since I had a week long binge/slip I had on crystal Meth in a specific house in another state, 3 states away from my current location (NC). My wife had to return to a town in Florida for a week...due to a family members ailing health. She didn't want to spend money on a hotel so she decided to stay at that very house I had that slip in 107 days ago (may 7th)

***I decided to NOT go*** because I knew it would be a massive trigger on my cravings, which are now  dormant after 107 days off. She took a close friend instead and I stayed behind which I felt bad for doing. But I knew it was the right decision to remain clean off methamp. I specifically told her it is best I ***do not*** go there again.

She called me on FB messenger tonight and used her camera for some reason. When I saw the insides of the house through my cell phone my cravings got triggered really badly despite me being 700 miles away from her. Memories of getting high on meth there came flooding back within seconds. I also remembered my terrifying meth psychosis episodes which I am trying very hard to forget and bury in the past.

Why does this happen? I feel like that house I used meth in so many times is a bad omen.

When I had that slip 107 days ago visiting down there I remember walking through the front door, into the living room where I used to binge. It took not even 5 minutes and I flew into this irrational extreme stress attack. I wanted to get high so badly right there and then. Just visiting that household again set my relapse in motion.  I got high breaking 1.5 years of sobriety. Kicking meth after that binge was extremely hard on my mind. Just feeling those insane cravings ***once again*** makes me scared to go near it or anything associated.

A little back-story, I got addicted after moving states for work, I was 25 and only used for around 8-10 weeks while working away before trying to quit as that job had finished and was back to the real world. I was foolishly unaware of just how much of a process is involved in quitting such an addictive drug. I was very fortunate to meet the most incredible and supportive person during that time who helped an immeasurable amount over the next year. Unfortunately it took me around 8 months of constant relapsing (generally 2-4 weeks between binging) to finally reach out for professional help and enrolling in a S.M.A.R.T program. All the while isolating myself from everyone I had known for the shame of being found out - as the fuckup who moved states to make something of himself and ending up addicted to meth- and hiding the extent of my relapses from the people I had left. 
Eventually my relationship fell apart after an argument turned physical which left me making promises to stay sober & plans to do drug tests every day that were never followed through with. Although I was still managing 2-4 weeks between using up until earlier in the year when corona hit gyms shut and I hurt my back at work leaving me unable to exercise I started using weekly again for a month followed by a few weeks sober and the cycle continued until June when I finally broke the cycle, started exercising and creating healthy habits again.
Anyway besides the first month abstaining which dragged my mental health to the depths of hell these past 2 months have far and away been the easiest since the beginning of last year. I‚Äôve been managing cravings with either hot yoga or going for a big run, keeping myself busy as possible on the weekends but I guess I just slipped up and didn‚Äôt apply other techniques I had learnt at recovery.
Hopefully over the coming days I‚Äôm not going to beat myself up about it, but instead use this relapse as a reminder that it is important to keep attending meetings even if things are going good. I guess only time will tell.


TL;DR relapsed after not using for 3 months which sucks but the road to recovery has been getting less hectic

Edit: also if anyone has any advice or suggestions let me know, this is uncharted territory for me as I generally don‚Äôt make it past early recovery symptoms before relapsing",8,{'rona': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4207083}"

That was on the 10th of August. I was serving a two year sentence at a halfway house for a burglary charge, and was about to start this felon-friendly workforce re-entry program once I got my documents in order. Then the next day I decided to fucking run from the halfway house. To go be homeless and smoke meth. 
I have seriously done this exact same thing 3 times in the past year. Get arrested, do some time, then run from probation and smoke meth and live in a tent. To be honest the other times it was at least somewhat understandable that I didn't get my shit together for probation.  I have no family nearby, nowhere to go, no job, nothing. I didn't even know where to begin fixing my life so I just went back to what I knew. 
But this time was majorly different. I had a plan in place. I had somewhere to live and people supporting me to change my life. If I had any issues or problems I could just go talk to my case manager about it. I was sober. My dad who wouldnt talk to me for years drove across the country to come visit me in rehab. He told me how proud he was and he was glad I was finally going to get sober. Things would have been wonderful. I could feel every day that things were getting better, and for the first time in years I actually had hope for a future. Then on August 11th I signed out on a pass to go to apply for a job. The bus didn't come because of some road work, and I decided it was a sign that I should just say fuck it all. So I walked back to the park downtown where all my old homeless friends hung out.  I saw my old best friend, and we got high together. That night when I was supposed to come back I got a million texts from people at the halfway house wondering where I was. I even had a chance to go back that night and only get a write up rather than getting kicked out and sent to prison, but i was wandering around town twacked out of my mind hiding in the bushes when I got that text. 
This is so fucking awful. I am going to prison for a minimum of 4 years now with a 3 year parole tail whenever I get caught. Every time I get high I spend hours staring into the distance because I think the cops are coming. It is summer and it soooooo hot and being homeless in this is unbelievably miserable. the soup kitchen I used to go to closed because of corona. I used to shoplift to eat before but I'm too scared now of getting caught and going to prison. I am living off the last couple hundred bucks of my stimulus check and have no future money in sight. I dont even really remember how I would get money when I was homeless before. Sometimes I would shoplift things for people and trade it for drugs, but all the people I used to do that with won't answer my texts anymore. And I am a wreck mentally. I can't even hold a conversation for two seconds with anyone. My social anxiety has like exploded and I just start stuttering and sweating and shaking whenever I try to talk to anybody. And because of that, all my old homeless ""friends"" think I'm a fucking weirdo and won't talk to me. Even my ""best friend"".  I am spending days alone at a time. I don't have anyone to talk to and nothing to look forward to. I bought a helium tank and made a suicide bag attachment for it to kill myself. As always I chickened out but it's the closest I've ever come. I have it hidden under a bridge across town.

I ended up smoking weed, having a panic attack and going to the hospital . I figured that was it, but boy was I wrong, I have managed to use a total of ten times, it‚Äôs like a blur. Nobody knows. I haven‚Äôt suffered any major consequences yet but there have been some close calls. It feels helpless like auto pilot, I‚Äôll make it two weeks and than just, boom. It‚Äôs fucked. I have an amazing life and I don‚Äôt want to lose it all over this but I feel sort of helpless. Anyways it‚Äôs been three days since my tenth use and finding this group is giving me confidence to stop this now. I‚Äôve been reading the tips on here and have started a journal and am going to work out and stop drinking. It seems the low of a hangover is the best igniter of using.

2 Days Later I was about to crash and of course I was homeless and couldn't sleep in the car during the day so guess what I did?

Yes, I drove back to the spot where I threw the pipe because I was thoughtful enough to throw it still zipped up inside its case with the empty baggie and everything.

I don't know what I was thinking because I had already gotten every last microcrystal out of that thing but I clearly threw it away intending to come back for it ...which I did on May 20th 2019.

Of course it was gone nowhere to be found. I called around to my people and went visiting my people and I even crawled around on the floor at their house with tweezers and  flashlight... but didn't find anything. 

somebody actually offered me some for free but I didn't have my stupid pipe and neither did they have any paraphernalia and so somehow I told myself that meant it was time to turn it down. I almost swallowed it right then and there but I didn't and I drove away for the last time 

So that was the last time. For real. I've been clean for 15 months now :-)

The thing is, though, it feels like a lateral move. I am finding Wellbutrin to be very similar to adderall in many ways. For the first week or two I was really wired up, high energy levels, then after that, energy levels back to shitty as usual. Just like adderall. Increased general anxiety levels, like adderall. Trouble sleeping. Getting way too obsessed about certain things, like adderall (for me anyways). Crashing hard and napping 5 or 6 hours after dosing. Jaw clenching. Dry mouth. Same stuff, different drug.

I am not hating Wellbutrin, actually think it's been okay, and plan to keep trying it for a while, but definitely finding it similar to adderall. Probably not a whole lot of people here who have been on both a stimulant, and wellbutrin, but I wanted to see if anyone had the same experience, or if someone could just explain why they work in similar ways (something to do with dopamine, I wager!).

Thank you for taking the time to click on my post.

A little about myself.
I am a working adult currently. Have been a smoker too. 
Smoking itself is bad and i knew it. Been hooked to cigarettes since the age of 12. 
I‚Äôm currently 27 now.

So, i started meddling with Meth, ice or whatever it‚Äôs called since 2014. But back then, i was just a social user, a one time affair. Never hooked nor crave. It was all in the name of fun. 

So from 2014- early 2019, i did not even thought of meth or any illicit drugs. 
Until, 2019 mid year, I had a friend who comes out on me confessing he sold drugs. 

Before I continue, let me just quickly share that from where I am from, illegal drugs and traffickers or dealers are SERIOUSLY dealt with. It‚Äôs punishable by death even. 

So, saying that, its roughly known that whoever consumes or sell, are basically looked upon as rats or garbage of society. 

Back to the story jizz, my friend introduced me to this meth back then in 2019. I remembered smoking up to 0.5 at one go. It made me so paranoid and scared that I had a terrible anxiety attacks. (I still do get then now)

I had a few months break (approximately 2 months) as my wife just gave birth late 2019. 
Mind you, i was smoking it almost everyday for 6-7 months. 

I got hooked up again when another random meet with my supplier, got me plunged into darkness again..
Its from this year January to now. With breaks of weeks in between. 

Honestly, deep inside, all i wanted and wished for is to get out of this hell hole. It sucks being here. Each time i smoked now, i do not feel the high that i felt back then. No happiness. I know, i really do know, my dopamine receptors are fried. My adrenal glands are tired. 
Basically, my whole body‚Äôs fucked.


So, now i am looking for ways to detox my whole body, especially liver and kidney. 
I wanna be ‚Äònew‚Äô again. If not, cleanse. 

I have not touch the ‚Äòhell stuff‚Äô for 3 days now. Not gonna lie, the cravings are real. The urge to see the smoke üí® thickens in the room is strong.
But i have told myself, for the sake of my body, my kid, i wanna be a normal dad.

I know there are other veteran users, using for years yet they still function as normal member of society. 

But i do not wish to reach the line of no return. 

Thank you once again for taking time to read my rants.

Have a good day. Stay safe.

PS: If anyone can recommend a good detox tea or infusion.",26,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8097665}"

At that  I had been abusing adderall like that for over a year while being a multi drug user for 5-6 years. But after taking 3000mg over 9 days, having -500ish bank balance it gave me the rock bottom to restart my life. Prior to this I hadn't been sober for longer then 2 weeks and I only went sober that long twice. 

I finally found a job as a driver which would pay me enough to survive as a college senior, I had been wanting to be muscular for years and had put on size for the first time in my life, my relationships were so much better then before, I had a vision and some type of self understanding. 

Last Tuesday I decided to drink a light 4%ABV tall can and it gave me enough dumbass ignition to immediately cop 120MG adderall (around 11pm) then binge all night. Next morning when I was sobering up, I didn't want to so I bought Weed/Nicotine until my plug woke up for more. I took my last dosage 3:30 pm today after taking pills over and over since that Tuesday with little to no sleep and immediately knocked out for an hour. I knocked out after taking 120mg of adderall.

In one week of binging:

I had finally been sober from everything: Alcohol lead to Addy, which lead to tree and nicotine. Everything on the menu. 

I had finally gotten a job as a driver: Car got injured while I was buying drugs and vehicle won't be approved so now I have no job. 

I had FINALLY started gaining muscle definition after talking about it for a week:  I think I've eaten 2 meals in the 5 days, with no energy to lift anytime soonl 

I had improved relationships: My parents now think that Im on track to becoming homeless.

I had a vision: That I can't get myself to believe in anymore.

I've went through something like that once before,  and I actually didn't realize my progress and how much better I'd gotten, untill I got back to as worse as I once was. Like I was maybe using any stim once every few months, and even if I binged it was two days tops. But then suddenly I was having 3 day binges every few days.

It takes such a huge physical toll, even when staying hydrated, eating , taking every supplement in the book. Eventually my  body just ran out of steam and I started getting weird blood pressure spikes and drops,  lots of nausea and generally just felt like shit. And, just like last time I did something like this, I felt so so disgusted by the thought of doing even a miligram more of any stimulant, even including caffeine.

So ever since I've been totally stimulant free. I feel a really strong aversion towards stimulants currently, probably because my body would just reject it physically and it's giving me a psychological adversion as well.

My main problem is.... I know I've gone through this same process many times before. Once the initial ""ew that was horrible""   phase wears off,  I start to minimize it in my head, and think "" well I made it out fine.""  and  "" I hardly had a comedown""   or ""I'm able to keep it hidden and manage to do what I need to do in my life so it can't be that bad of a problem"" .  These thoughts are irrational because it really does cause a major impact,  the comedowns do get awful (mostly physical though) and I really have been afraid of causing myself major physical harm in these binges. How tf am I supposed to keep this current mindset? 

TL;DR  ;

I currently feel an aversion to taking stimulants, and really feel like this time will be different. But I also know I've felt this exact same way before, and still ended up binging at some point.

Burn your dealer's number. Get a new phone if necessary.

Get a hobby. Fuck it, get three.

Focus on making every day a little better than the last. You can't do it all at once.

Remember you're only as sick as your secrets.

There is no cheat day.

Find something or someone to fall in love with.

https://paulearley.net/download/pamphlets/7-chapter-5-of-the-cocaine-recovery-book/file

This article explains the cyclical nature of cocaine. This lack of daily use makes it hard to feel like an addict. Your sober 99% of the time right? 

I personally believe it is unique. Other stims I want daily to make the day easy. Not this one. Some users of cocaine are dependent (physically) but that‚Äôs actually less common.


The reason it was so hard to find the problem is because this drug is very different from alcohol. You probably only consume it once a week, a month, two weeks. You feel disgusted afterward.

Personally when I wake up after using I don‚Äôt even want to look at cocaine. I puke at the thought and want some comedown aid (downers). Try not to die and pray to god I won‚Äôt use again. 

But every time I do. I have gone a year. 6 months, 4 months. I don‚Äôt even think about it. 

If you think you are not an addict because you only use once every two weeks. Be aware of the fact, the compound works that way. If you have experienced damage, lost friends, money, wanted to stop, and you still used, your an addict.

What does a daily IV meth user, a twice a year cocaine user, and a prescription Vyvanse user have in common....

Absolutely fucking nothing beside using stimulants. That one beside is big though. We get come downs and ups.

When I take vtvanse I never dose again and again. I‚Äôve tried meth and hated it. The comedowns are manageable for me.

One night of cocaine literally makes me so anxious that I wake up chugging vodka for days until I piss out of my ass. 

I quit for 6 months but the feel for that drip and rush came back. One night and in squirting shit out of my ass chugging vodka searching for a way to seem normal.

But a year of no cocaine but casual drinks and prescription drugs I get a masters and a job.

Isn‚Äôt it clear that we are all different. Wasn‚Äôt this big book made before we knew anything about neurochemistry. And yes it is true that many non treated ADD patients have quit cocaine using your drug of choice, an amphetamine.

We all are here because we have experienced hell. I just wish that there was some more science, thought and intention behind using to word ‚Äúuse‚Äù ‚Äúaddict‚Äù ‚Äúdrug‚Äù. Are we talking physical dependence? Occasional binges? Caffeine or meth? Why is smoking cigs okay. 

If I do cocaine again I will lose everything. If I do not treat my ADD I will lose my job and relapse. 

My life is so manageable and I am so privileged until I touch blow. I know people who have focused on one substance, blow but still treat their ADD. Riding a bike is a mind altering substance.

Today I relapsed on amphetamines after 5 days being ""sober"" 

To introduce myself:  I'm Male (22) and started smoking weed daily when I was 15. At the age of 18 I had my first experience with MDMA.
I always was interested in drugs and how they affect our body and consciousness. Before I tried a new substance I always researched the effects and dosages etc. It was also important for me to take breaks after using to regenerate and not fucking up my brain chemistry too much. 

Last year I decided to take things slow while I was looking for a university to study social work. At the same time I was working once or twice a week for about 8hrs. That means I had a lot of time going to raves and basically party all year long. 

From taking things like mdma, speed, ketamine once every month rapidly became once a week or multiple times a week mixing all of them. Very fast speed became my drug of choice and I almost spent everyday doing it. It became normal to binge for 3-5 days straight. Over the year I had to deal with severe depression, an unhealthy relationship, friends and family worrying about me. 
At the end of November my ex gf called me and we started spending more and more time together. Obviously she noticed that Im on drugs all the time  and worried a lot. 
Depression and everything got worse all the time to the point I had to stop abusing all those substances. 
January I decided to become clean and looking for therapeutic help. Time was really hard and I kept struggling with depression and anxiety and the thought of relapsing.
Laat month was the first time I relapsed. I bought some speed and binged for 3 days........ The comedown was harsh and I was really ashamed of myself and what I have done. Since then i started using speed almost daily again.. I really want to quit! I'm exhausted! In that period I lost about 10kg weight. I currently weigh 72kg on 1.90cm. 
A week ago I tried to go clean again and well.... It lasted 6 days until today and Im speeding again. Snorted about a gram over the evening alone in my room talking to people on discord. 

Its really hard to think and write proper sentences so I'm sry if it's a bit messy. I just wanted to share my current situation with the community. Maybe someone can relate.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6636817}"

As of right now I'm still a daily meth user, smoke and i.v. Every few days. Sleep every night (maybe about 5 or 6 hours, but I'm sat here hearing my neighbour saying he's going to kill me yet again (psychosis that's happened before) 

So clearly i need a break. But here's the dilema. I've had to move back home with my mum after me and my ex split up, My sister was flat hunting anyway so we arranged is sleep on the sofa until she moves then I get her old room until I get my shit together. Pretty much she brought bed bugs back from her mate (I know exactly which one) and didn't tell anyone (dunno why)

We can't afford the prices of an exterminator so I've been trying to keep on top of it myself but they at so fucking resilient omg! White spiri t kills them s o I've been spraying everywhere daily (I know toxic but it's the only thing I've found that works) and washing sheets/ clothes constantly. Like everyday I'm focused on this 

This is my dilema. Every second I'm not fighting it they're breeding and laying eggs and it makes me feel sick. I need to take a break from the meth but if I do I'm not gonna wanna do anything and their numbers will start risin g..

Used to abuse Ritalin so much but my  addiction really picked up when covid-19 Lockdown begun. Long story short I went through a shit ton of Ritalin. But I done research I learnt about dexedrine and how much more euphoric it is. I had a friend who offered to sell me some 100 pills for $150. I know that it's very cheap he had gave me 70 mg vyvanse for $5 each previously and I was going to pay more but he said these are 5 mg each you have to be dumb to pay that much he said. So I went with it.
 having so much dexedrine leads to abuse & addiction very quickly especially when you have  low self-esteem. He became that bad we are used to look forward to waking up and taking it
Long story short I started to have severe panic attacks and severe anxiety and then started to. Dissociated bad for 3 months living hell. Even though I'm not abusing it anymore and have haven't for one month I constantly think about it have dreams about getting high. It's my security blanket is gone now. when I was upset I would get high when I was angry I would get high when I was bored I would get high. And the only time I feel like myself is when I'm high.. when I was I abusing it i would go through 100 to 150 mg a  day of dexedrine and be up for. Hours my longest binge was 3 days awake. It's just so hard when drug help me with my ADHD so much I can't live like this anymore I want my realself back so badly.",9,"{'covid': 1, 'lockdown': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6472986}"
2020-08-02 23:00:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/i2pec8/is_there_such_thing_as_a_therapeutic_dose/,Is there such thing as a therapeutic dose?,"I've been on prescription meds for around a year now. I've mainly used dex and Vy. When I asked my psychiatrist about the long term effects, they didn't seem  to concerned about any. The ADHD sub is inundated with threads about success stories with their medication, and generally there seems to be a culture of positive reinforcement towards people getting on medication. The thing is most of these folk posting seem to be on their honeymoon period.

Now I too felt improvements in the order of leaps and bounds. But it's gotten to the point where I can feel the tide turn. To the point where I can the feel the negative effects more than the positive ones. I just recently found this the sub and it has totally shone a new light on this matter. I'd only ever seen people viewing amphetamine usage as the miracle cure, and now all of a sudden I see there is a dark side.

It must be said. I've never abused these drugs, but I'm now questioning whether they actually have a place for long-term use. Asking a community that is trying to move on from amps has obviously a reason to move on from it. So I am expecting a certain bias in the discussion. But I do feel you folk are better position to give mature answers. Answers from a point of understanding of what using these substances in the long run actually entails. Especially compared to other communities who've perhaps not ridden as many waves.

So, therapeutic  amp usage. Does such a thing exist? If it's not abused? Perhaps in cycles, like you see with PED usage? On any given day I'm either on 40mg of vy, or 5-15mg of dex. It's had a very positive impact on my life, but if the path it leads to is a dark one, is it better to stop now and find a lifestyle better suited to my personality?
