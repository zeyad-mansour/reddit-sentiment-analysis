Physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually, you feel like you have been poisoned. Like something has gone horrifically wrong. And something has. Your pulverized brain has been completely drained of the chemicals that create feelings of happiness and pleasure and as a result these feelings become non existent in you. Nothing brings you joy or happiness anymore. Food doesn't taste good. Music doesn't sound good. Movies and TV shows and books and video games and all other forms of entertainment are no longer fun or enjoyable. All your favorite hobbies feel like nothing more than chores. Socializing becomes nothing short of torture. Even the touch of your lover feels like cold sandpaper against your skin. You feel like you're never going to be okay. You feel like this pain will last forever and there's nothing you can do to end it. All you want is to vanish from existence until it subsides. Physically you feel like death on two legs. You are dying of hunger yet you cannot eat. You are dying of thirst yet you cannot drink. You are dying of exhaustion yet you cannot rest. It's a torture I wish for no one. Your eyes are dry and your vision blurred. Your mouth and throat are dry and taste like death itself. Your teeth and dry and aching like hell. Your head is pounding as if there's a marching band playing inside it. Your heart feels as though its in a vice and about to explode at any moment. Your neck, shoulders, back, and chest are screaming in agony as it feels as though someone is pulling the muscles apart. Your abdomen feels as if it's been run through by spears. Your entire body aches and creaks as you try to move. You feel lightheaded and weak as a result of inadequate food, water, and sleep. You feel like you're going to pass out when you stand up. No matter what you do no matter how hard you try there is no relief to be found anywhere. You are trapped in your anguish, left to suffer alone as you yearn for the slightest ounce of relief. But it never comes. Abusing adderall is like taking out a loan. And like all loans, it has to and WILL be paid back in full with interest on top. After all, all good things must come to an end. Incredible pleasure comes at the price of incredible pain. A pain I have come to know all too well over the years. And in spite of that pain, I continue to use despite knowing full well that it will only bring me more suffering. The euphoria, energy, motivation, and focus those little orange pills once granted faded long ago. And in their place came an empty, hollow, perverse pleasure that can hardly even be called pleasure at this point. It's a monstrous feeling that pushes out all other emotions and consumes you entirely. I hate it, I hate myself, I hate what I've become, but I just can't stop. It's all I have. My deadly poison is also my necessary medicine. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to fight anymore. After all what's it all for? What's the point? Why try to quit when it's all that sustains me? When it's all I have to look forward to? This is no life. This is hell.",56,0

While I was using Vyvanse my weed consumption spiked massively. I thought it would go down when I quit Vyvanse but it’s starting to seem like I traded one dependency for another as I cant seem to bring it under control. In order to quit Vyvanse all I had to do was tell my doctor I didn’t need it anymore and there was no way for me to get it after my script ended. Pretty simple. But considering I live in a legal state weed is fucking everywhere and it’s never more than 2 texts and a 10 minute drive away.  


I myself have been stoning for over 4 years, my neighbor smokes, all my friends smoke, my boss smokes, my coworker smokes, there’s no avoiding it. That being said, weed isn’t exactly tearing my life apart like Vyvanse was; I have a job, girlfriend, active social life, good grades, and a very consistent, healthy sleep schedule. Weed IS however tearing my wallet apart. I just looked at my bank acc and I’ve blown $300 on weed just within the month of August. Do people have any tips for cutting back? Is there another sub like this for potheads?  


P.S. I don’t have any negative views toward pot or people that smoke and am 100% in favor of legalization, I would just like some help developing a healthier relationship with the substance.",3,0

My (30) husband (30) used to be a long time weed smoker & somewhat of a drinker. He stopped smoking weed but unfortunately it made him a heavier drinker. After a while of hitting his low, he quit. He was depressed for quite a bit, but slowly became normal. Not completely normal, because I know that theres a lot if him he wants to improve on & overcome. I'm absolutely proud of him because of what he's accomplished. I tried my best to let him know that he's struggling & that I'd be his rock as he's always been mine. I saw a new him that I hadn't seen before. 

I found a popper bottle thinking it was just a cleaning solution. Left it there without a second thought. Later as I was looking for something I found what looked like a meth pipe. After that I couldn't help but search everything & everywhere. Found a baggie with what I guess is meth?? & after researching the ""cleaning solution"" I learned that it was a popper. 

I don't know what to do or say. I'm nervous & I don't want to shame him, or make him feel like I'm judging him. I want to be open with him & let him know that I'm not mad, & I just want to help him. He's helped himself with overcome weed smoking & alcohol along with my support. I believe in him so much. I love him dearly. I want the best for him. I want him to have a good fulfilling life. 

But this is something i just don't know how to handle.. How do I help him? What do I say? How do I approach this? I could really use any advice. This is such an alien topic for me I feel completely ignorant & helpless.

Initially, I used everyday for a year before I got to the point of an 8ball a day habit and meth induced psychosis / hospitalization. After getting out of the hospital I was clean for 5 months, then began the cycles of clean time and relapse that have plagued me ever since. The most I’ve ever gone has been 8 months clean but lately I’ve been relapsing a lot more frequently, and it feels like a losing battle. I find that I don’t feel like myself when I’m sober - I just feel wrong. It’s sinister the way meth makes you a completely different person when you’re on it , and you get to the point where you don’t even recognize who you really are. I’ve struggled my whole life with chronic fatigue, depression , and complex PTSD that made it hard for me to be productive. Meth allowed me to become the go getter that I always wanted to be, but never had the energy for naturally. When I’m sober, It doesn’t matter how much sleep I get or what supplements I take , I am constantly tired. I am always having to force myself to  do things instead of laying down. I’ve tried healthy habits, exercise, NA, I moved to a new state and started over- everything. But I just feel so off when I’m sober. My brain function has deteriorated so much that I constantly have brain fog and intense anxiety, even after months of clean time. I feel like I’m fighting a losing battle and I’ve already done too much damage to function at a reasonable capacity without it… it bothers me how unproductive and “off” I am when I’m sober and I feel like I’m not reaching my full potential. I don’t know how to come to terms with that feeling or how to stop feeling less like a person when I’m sober.",19,0

One of my closest friends has been smoking meth for several years now. He has expressed wanting to quit or cut back, but never seems to try to follow through on it. As a recovering heroin/fentanyl addict myself I sympathize greatly, but I am getting so worried about him. 

He’s changed in the last year. He’s gotten so paranoid. He set up cameras around his apartment and outside and hardly ever takes his eyes off of them. No matter what he’s doing he has his tablet right there and just gazes at it for hours. Every little noise he goes “what was that” and will go to investigate unless I can explain it away as something that I did like shuffling my feet or my laptops cooling fan starting up. He double locks his front door and locks his bedroom door once we’re inside. He makes random loud noises under the belief that it will scare off anyone that might be sneaking into his apartment. 

He refuses to turn the volume on the TV up past hardly a whisper and he got really upset with me the other night for coughing too much/too loud cause he is always extremely anxious that if his neighbors hear anything from him they will call the police (and god forbid the neighbors bump a wall and trigger him). I actually felt pretty hurt by that — he just kept bringing it up as something I had done wrong when it should have been a normal, forgettable thing. I think that’s the most upset with me he’s ever been actually. 

I try to bring it up from time to time. I tried the other night. I told him I was worried about him and how stressed out he seemed and that I just wanted him to be well, etc. And he listened. He always listens, and he nods slightly, and he seems at least self aware enough still that on some level he recognizes his behavior as Not Good. But that’s as far as it goes. He never lets the conversation go deeper than bare bones acknowledgement of the problem. I asked him if there was anything I could do to help him and he just said “don’t cough again” and I sadly said alright. 

He’s such a good guy and I love him so much and I’m so scared that his brain is going to get so damaged that I’ll lose him forever. I’ve seen it happen to other meth addicts. But I don’t know how to help him.

I hate that it feels like I’m walking on eggshells whenever I try to express my concern for him or offer support, even though I know that’s just about all I can do. One time, months ago I told him he was acting paranoid and he said “I’m more paranoid now that you said that” and it got me scared now that I could say the wrong thing and drive him even further into the deep end..

He’s smart — he’s so goddamn smart, so I have been holding onto hope that he’s intelligent enough to put together the pieces that tell him that his paranoia is illogical so he can fight back against it, but….. that last conversation we had where I brought up how worried I was and he only responded by telling me not to cough again…. It was jarring. It’s telling me that he’s losing his awareness of what’s real or not. His ability to be reasonable is slipping. Even just a few months ago he spoke about his anxiety and paranoia with more clarity — he used to express that he knew what he was experiencing wasn’t rooted in reality, and he said that being conscious of that fact was keeping him grounded. “Yes I’m paranoid but I know that I’m being paranoid”, however problematic, was a lot more comforting than the silence he offered me the other night when I tried to bring all of this up. 

I just don’t know what to do. I told him I’ll always be his friend no matter what, but it’s already getting a little unpleasant to be around him. Watching him stare at cameras for hours, getting told constantly to be quiet and lower the volume lower my voice dont cough dont this dont that etc etc etc. having to wait for him to investigate nonexistent threats before he will get back to the video game we’re playing. Being around him when he’s filled with so much stress, it makes me get stressed too. I just miss when we used to be able to hang out without this blanket of anxiety over everything. I miss when he was able to relax. 

Sorry… I just really needed to be able to talk about this. I’m crying now so I’m gonna stop. Thank you if you read this, and any feedback or advice would be so appreciated. Thank you. Stay safe. Please.",14,0

Late teens and early 20's I used mostly coke, weed and booze.  Its pretty hard to hide a cocaine habit as an young adult who lives with their parents, because it is so expensive and the effects it has on your body and mood.  So with the support of my family, I got over the cocaine habit at around 21 years old.  Never stopped with the booze or weed though.  At some point a few years after that, I was introduced to amphetamines.  It was cool. I mean I don't really need to describe the appeal in this sub, right?  I used it occasionally when with certain friends, and eventually got a script of my own.  Again, I'm pretty sure most in this sub can guess where it went from there.  Taking the script in a few days day, buying more off the street to supplement the aforementioned abuse.  

I'm still abusing it and blowing tons of money, since I'm currently uninsured and Adderall is somewhat of a designer drug in the town I currently live in.  That's not my main concern, although blowing money on shit that inhibits me from growing and being an actual fucking person does suck.  I just want to get my life together.  The most frustrating thing about Adderall is that no one in my life can really tell how bad this has gotten.  And when I try to talk to people I trust about it, it doesn't seem as serious as say, opioids, or it just doesn't feel serious to them because I seem to be holding things together fine enough.

So I'm currently looking for a psychologist.  And I've given all this backstory to ask the simple question, what can I tell a psychologist?  Maybe its my speed brain paranoia but I'm really afraid of being forced into inpatient rehab if I am honest about my current situation.  Also, I believe my substance abuse and impulsivity may stem from unresolved childhood trauma, so with that.. should I seek out help from someone who specializes in substance abuse or trauma?",3,0

Or is it a hopeless pursuit?,"Hi friends. Tried amphetamines for the first time in 2016, used it every now and then up till 2018 without issue. Then I got diagnosed with ADHD, was put on 50mg Vyvanse a day, took that for a year and something just switched in my head.

I started doubling doses if not more, redosing all night long, it was all I wanted to do. It wasn't good for my mental health so I decided to try to cut it off before it became too big of a problem. So I quit my prescription. Didn't help at all, if anything I got even worse.

Started stealing pills from my SO at the time since she had a Vyvanse prescription too. If she didn't have enough, I could always buy regular street speed as well. I could write paragraph after paragraph of my gradual descent into madness, but that's not why I'm here.

I hit my lowest point in early 2020. I was staying up about 2 to 4 days at the time, popping benzos to catch some z's, only to wake up and repeat it all over again. And bang. Plane alarms are going off, the country is being invaded, I hear worried neighbors outside and I lose my shit. 

My own family was outside, talking shit, wanted to disown me, landlord wanted to kick me out, everyone was out to get me. I ran out the door, utterly consumed by fury and rage, screamed profanities and ran around the neighborhood trying to catch the people I were seeing.

5 hours in, I text my mom, ranting about everything she had said about me, and she had no fuckin idea what I was talking about. It hit me like a bullet, none of it was real. Took 3 days until I stopped hearing voices and the delusions began to fade, despite sleeping and staying away from the amphetamines. Definitely up there among the most traumatic things I've experienced in life. 

Went off on a little tangent there haha, but I hope it gives some insight into the depths of my addiction. After that experience, I stopped immediately. It was my catalyst for change and I didn't want to touch it ever again.

8 months later, I decide to try it again and the same behavior kicked in instantly. Excessive doses and binging. I ended up having a few binges spread out over the next 2-3 months, but it didn't get nearly as bad as it used to. 

So finally, to the reason I'm making this post. I've accepted a new prescription of Vyvanse, 30mg. I've made it a point to not take 50mg because I don't want to feel ""high"" on this which 50mg makes me feel. All in all, 30mg works surprisingly well for me. It's more of a background thing and doesn't take as much space in my mind as higher doses do. I feel like me, not high or much of any side effects at all.

I can see how 30mg of Vyvanse can help me get my life back on track and make some real changes to how I live my life. But... I got my first prescription 2 months ago and both times I ran out within 10 days after picking up my prescription. I picked up my latest prescription 2 days ago and I've already gone through 10 pills.

The addiction I've learned doesn't seem to be letting go... I was able to moderate my use before, but now I can't help but succumb to the temptation. This is such a frustrating place to be. I truly believe that using my prescription the way I should would do wonders for me. I want to believe that it's possible. I still believe it's possible... but so far, I haven't proven shit other than the fact that I'm still chasing the dragon.

So Reddit... What do you think? Perhaps asking /r/StopSpeeding is a bad choice as most of you guys probably want to quit completely, and those of you who've been able to moderate their use probably ain't hanging out here anymore. But still, do any of you have any stories to share with me? Am I clinging onto this in vain?",24,0

Is there any sort of methless meth?","Alright so basically if you've ever methed around and spun a bowl once or twice you probably already know the actual process of smoking your meth is an addictive activity by itself. The act of loading, smoking, rolling your bowl becomes a hell of a lot of fun for a lot of us and to be completely honest- I'm fucking tired of doing dope, my biggest obstacle (in my current opinion) is eliminating the habit of smoking it. Not the drug itself, ice is poison dawg, it's the oral fixation and undeniably impressive clouds you get and the fucking ritual of social smoking. Those are what's worrying me because it's high time for me to sober up, and I wanna do it, but I just feel like I'm gonna miss simply smoking a bowl too much to really commit to sobriety and this time around I really wanna be done for good. So reddit, this is my weak ass coming to you in my time of need- can somebody please tell me that there is an available product that is essentially ""near beer"" but for dope? Like all the fun of smoking meth but without all the fun of being on meth haha. Like hitting a vape with 0% nicotine. Nonalcoholic beer. A placebo, help me lie to myself and still hopefully go through the same motions just without getting high. I'm aware of how stupid of a request this is and I'm cool with that. But yo if there's an actual option like that out there for me that would be fucking incredibly helpful to me and my girl. Obviously this would only be a temporary crutch with the eventual goal being able to turn my back on this shit forever, but this would just make it a little easier on me. This is a weird post to try to word correctly but I hope y'all get what I'm saying right now. Also please understand that I first tried dope when I was 16 and now I'm 23 and I've been doing this shit daily since 2015. So unfortunately it's been a really major character in my story. My whole ""adulthood"" for the most part. So y'all help me out, is there a way to make this shit easier to get away from? Is there dopeless dope? Thanks 💜",1,0

One things I wanted to just bring awareness too, because it's been a BIG game changer for me, is that some of the symptoms we have, and which we likely used to remedy, may be issues with our genetics. 

For myself I had suffered with mood disorders all my life and chronic fatigue and fog. I have been diagnosed with ADHD-PI and medicine for that did really help me get my shit together and start myself on the sober path fully. However, it's often been the chronic fatigue, anxiety and down in the dumps mood that caused me a big barrier to enjoying life and what often made me turn to uppers to deal with it. 

I found out I am homozygous with a double mutation of my MTHFR gene on the c677t gene... Basically this means my body does and always has been useless at running it's methylation system and I don't convert things as I should be a very big almost 80% failure rate. I've been supplementing with methylfolate now for a month and the difference is incredible!!! I don't have chronic fatigue anymore and I still cannot believe it was ever  possible to exist for weeks on end with energy and a good mood and literally have no idea how the fuck I managed previously (except the obvious using drugs to force energy). 
There's also a heterozygous form of these mutations and it's really worth looking into seeing if you might have this going on because it's something you can easily address and manage and really should know about. 
There's many reports about the link it has with addiction... I can't recall figures but I'm one screening of addicts over half of them had one of these mutations... That's a lot considering how common the mutations are in the general public. Also, many of you here say you believe you have or are diagnosed with ADHD or ASD and this mutation is VERY common in those who have these conditions. 

Just wanted to bring it up as it's helped me out loads to learn this about myself and I had never heard of it before and assume maybe you lot haven't either.

But never really getting my sense of ""normality"" back.

Edit/quick background: my SO is a meth addict. He relapsed on Tuesday. We went to a store yesterday and while we were paying, I didn’t hear that he was asking a question. That was enough to get him in full of rage - because he had to repeat himself. He asked for an apology, I asked, “why do I need to apologize for?” 

That was literally the only reason why he called me every name in the book, and he told me “I can’t stand you”, “jacking off is better than being with you”, “being in a hotel is better than being with you” “you think you’re special?” among another things…

He was going to leave me in a bad place in town because I was ignoring his insults. I responded, and he then continued going home (continuing with arguing). When we finally got home, he yelled at the top of his lungs “GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY CAR!!!”

When I did, he immediately left to go get beer. While he did that, I went home, laid in my bed and started sobbing. He came home and started drinking in the living room, and passed out a couple hours later. I went to bed, with dried up tears, puffy eyes and emotionally drained. 

This morning he tried to act as if nothing happened. When he was surprised that I was still angry, he still tried to justify why he said all those things. His excuse? I didn’t show him respect, and that I didn’t apologize.

I've been sober 18 months. Early on, cravings were pretty intense but as I rerouted my brain into a new way of thinking/being, the cravings gradually subsided.

Fast forward to three weeks ago, when I left my normalized environment for an unsupervised work trip out of town. I used to love to hole up in a hotel room  and get high for 3 or 4 days and return home after the crash. I had to interact with patients who were high and had access to meth on a regular basis on top of it. 

The last three weeks were hell on earth. I'd say 70% of my waking time was spent in the craving zone. I was having using dreams EVERY night. Awful. The only thing that got me through it was meetings, talking to my sponsor, and exercise. 

Now that I have returned home to the environment in which I got sober, no cravings. Zero. Life has returned to normal in less than 24 hours. Environmental cues are HUGE when it comes to stimulant abuse. I know the adage ""wherever you go, there you are"", but I think a special caveat should be added for speed freaks. Triggers are VERY REAL. If I had been up there another two weeks, who knows if I'd still be sober. I feel like I learned a valuable lesson, just wanted to pass it on. Have a good day.",18,0

But I literally need them to be able to sleep at all the days after stims. I'm naturally a very poor sleeper so I have benzos prescribed, without them even a single dose of amphetamine could have me awake for multiple days.

The thing is, I've been in a binge cycle for a few weeks now. Binge in the weekend, regret and recover during the week, repeat. I've promised myself this was the last time but you know how it goes, I've promised myself this before. 

The thing is because this has been going on for several weeks I have been taking benzos almost every weekday for like 4 weeks now. I take very small doses bc like I said it's not particulary recreational, but I'm developing a fear of becoming too dependent on them and to be honest I do kind of abuse them by using them to lower the physical and mental stress of the days after the binge, not just for sleep.

Am  I worrying too much?  Because I know how fucked up I am with stimulants, I have a big fear of developing addictions for other things so I've freadked out about benzos before but so far my psych has told me every time that I have nothing to worry about and that it takes a longer time and bigger doses for dependency to build up. But I haven't told them yet about the last few weeks so idk. Wondering if anyone here has had a similar experience. 

Simply stopping taking the benzos is really not an option for me,  I can't sleep without them (believe me tried evefything)  when I'm in  a stressful mindset (which I always am after a binge)  and if I start missing sleep I risk (re)entering a psychotic or manic episode.",8,0

Dosing 90mg XR typically during the work week & 30-60mg on the weekends. Supplementing my 60mg/day XR script with IRs from a friend when I run out. Started 10mg/day in 2017 and the addiction took over from there. 

I want and NEED to quit. But every time I stop consumption for a few days, I feel like my emotions are out of control. 

This looks like:

-Crying for seemingly no reason a LOT 

-Irritability which affects my bf, family, coworkers. The smallest things will get under my skin.

-More joy/laughter. A good thing- but I laugh almost manically? Where I feel like I shouldn’t be laughing so much/my response is overcompensating.

I do also experience all the “normal” withdrawal symptoms including ravenous hunger, oversleeping, lack of motivation etc. While I know working through the withdrawal sober with these factors will be a bitch, the typical symptoms aren’t what prevents me from quitting. 

As someone who is relatively self aware & normally always in tune with myself emotionally, I just hate the feeling of being out of control and feeling psycho.

Has anyone else experienced this? Advice appreciated.",15,0

I think because I knew I was done and I had it in my head that I was never going to take Adderall again, the withdrawals were so much easier than those I would have in between prescriptions (due to running out).

To be clear, this is my experience, So I’m not saying this will be the case for everyone. But if you’re ready to stop it is doable.  It is nothing like opiate withdrawals or even benzo withdrawals.

Been using meth for most of this year, mainly smoking  but occasionally insuflating, drinking it or boofing. At best I've had 3 weeks off in a row, other than that usage has been consistent.

Currently consuming .5g-1g a day. I had always told myself that I'd be able to get on top of it when I was ready by myself but I've now realized I have no control over it whatsoever. I'm still trying to determine if it's because I don't actually want to stop using or if that's just the nature of the drug and my addiction?

My doctor told me he can't prescribe any medication to help with reducing meth usage and he encouraged me to talk to my partner about it (have hid my usage from her). I'm not sure if this is the best tactic as I was hoping to talk to her when I was somewhat in control of my addiction so she wouldn't just up and leave and then I'd have no support network.

I struggled with Adderall addiction for the better part of 10 years and finally decided to quit one year ago today, thanks to this sub!


It was really hard at first and for a few months I had almost no energy. But I did my best to keep as normal of a routine as possible, and found other ways to cope with my ADHD.


I also majorly cut back on alcohol, started running, and now I’m training for a half marathon. I’m back to my ideal weight (after gaining a lot when quitting) and have more energy than I have in years. I don’t crave or smoke cigarettes anymore. My relationships are INFINITELY better.


Also probably the best part of all: I got my annual review at work the other day. I got such a good evaluation that my boss had to submit it to *her* boss because nobody ever gets such a high score and it’s a big deal. 😭


I don’t know. I don’t mean for this to sound braggy but I am extremely proud of myself. And I can’t believe I relied on Adderall for so long when REALLY it was holding me back this whole time. I thought I would never ever be able to quit.


Only downside is my house is no longer spotless because it turns out I hate cleaning lol. But I’m working on it!

I know that my concerns may seem trivial compared to the risk of relapsing, you may think I'm making excuses, etc. I promise I'm not and this is something that legitimately scares me.

About a month or so ago, I asked my psychiatrist to switch me from Adderall to Provigil. I didn't mention that I'd been going over the prescribed dose, I just said it was making things worse and not helping.

I wanted to just quietly quit without making a big deal about it, and so far I haven't had any cravings or withdrawals. However, I came clean to my fiancé and tomorrow, I'll be seeing a therapist to talk about it and some other issues. Depending on how it goes I may tell my psychiatrist.

My main concern: What will happen if I'm diagnosed with a substance abuse disorder? I have some rare, difficult-to-treat medical conditions and I'm worried that if I'm branded as an ""addict"" then I'm going to be denied treatment rather than trusted to make informed decisions. If I have surgery, will they just give me plain old Vicodin or will they have to use some experimental drug that costs more, or doesn't work as well? If I fly somewhere, will my two doses of 0.5mg Ativan become a huge liability? Will drugs like Provigil or Sunosi become off-limits because the government arbitrarily decided they were as dangerous as Xanax? These things were never problems before.

I don't want to ruin the rest of my life over a few bad decisions. But keeping it a secret isn't an option, either. I just don't trust doctors after how I've been treated in the past.",5,0

She has BPD/traumas and ALWAYS craves, if she can't do any drugs then she'll overeat, oversleep or binge-watch Netflix, and that's what we did, got back in shape for these 8 months, but the last few weeks, we did some MDMA, LSD and 2c-b, all of which were great and liberating for me, but for her it was always different, right after she finished peaking on any of these drugs, she was having meth cravings so intense that she'd wind up having major depression or panic attacks, banging her head into the wall to ""silence the screaming voice"", etc. 

I love her a lot and this pretty much ruined all of my psychedelic comedowns, being in an overly emphatic state and seeing her suffer like that, being unable to help and just having to ride it out. I barely craved at all compared to her constant cravings over the last few months, but ever since these last few trips, which were meant to be ""healing"", both of us ended up with stronger cravings for meth than before. 

I am making this post as a last cry for help for preventing our relapse, since the trips, as she constantly kept referring to meth in everyday conversation and considering everything boring, I've been tempted into ordering a gram of high quality meth and 10x acid, neither of which is not yet in our possession, but most probably will be soon. 

Is there any chance or way of us not touching the meth to prevent the relapse, or possibly use just once or twice then get rid of it and not get any again? I've never had a bad trip in my life and never craved while tripping, honestly I wish we could take more acid and I just want her to go into thought loops and stop saying that she wants a big fat line when I'm trying to cuddle with her after the peak of our acid trip is over. 

On Facebook recovery groups I've read about someone being in a similiar situation, saying that doing both meth and acid together made them realize that they truly never want to do meth again, and claims to have stopped having cravings from then on. This sounds like it could either go truly South or actually help us rewire our brains, but considering that my gf's had traumas and psychotic episodes before, I am vary of the issues that could arise from such a combo. 

I am truly, deeply anxious about all of this and I am please begging anyone who's still reading this post to give us advice, any and all help or insight would be appreciated on what would be the best thing to do in this situation, thank you...

We both have tried a lot of different substances and so we are pretty used to drugs being a thing. 
So, I have a good friend who has been a ""functioning"" meth addict for 15 years. When I go to their house I have a hoot or 2 then that's that. 
About 3 months ago, they asked if we'd buy some to help her out and we did. I did a bit too much, started crying and decided "" I don't want this life"" and since then, I have still had some here and there if my friend comes by but have not bought it or had a problem with it. 
However, my boyfriend is not having such an easy time. He has been buying it regularly and smoking it almost every day. 
First thing I noticed was he started to hide the drugs, telling me he he has to because I have a problem and he doesn't want me to freak out like I did the time I mentioned before.
And now I've noticed his temper has become so short he is almost always on edge. He has been being rude to me, disrespectful, insulting me and yesterday when we went to a friend's, he started yelling at me and trying to argue with me, I asked, calmly, ""what am I doing that is upsetting you? Why are you trying to fight with me?"" Because there was literally no reason.. 
He just started yelling more, and saying no one listens to him. 
I went with one friend elsewhere on the property and the other stayed with him. 
He eventually calmed down and went to sleep. 
I'm so devastated. He has always been an absolute sweetheart, wrapped up in happy and love. And now he is.. this. My heart is breaking because I told my friend to cut him off and I'm going to talk to him tomorrow when he is off work and lay it down that he needs to stop this or I am gone. I've been through so much abuse and I'm not doing it again. I'm just so sad. He was the man who was showing me that I am worthy of love and care, he's always said, ""I know you know, but I will always prove myself to you, just so you always know for sure""
I'm wondering if anyone has some input here. Is there an advantage to the fact its only been a few months? Is there hope he can turn this around before it's too late if I can get him to listen to me?

Update: I told him that the drugs were changing him. Initially, he got pretty defensive and started to tell me that they weren't. Then I laid everything out, told him what I was seeing and what our friends noticed etc he calmed down after a bit of denying things and said that he could be hyperfixating on things that make him angry because these drugs can do that. When I told him I was scared he was going to choose the drugs he softened completely and just held me and told me he will not do them anymore. I'm going to keep my eyes on him and watch for any signs. Thank you all for your input, support, stories and wisdom. I will update again in maybe a week or two.

So it's been a tad rough but he's been clean from meth since we talked. I was so scared and all your words helped us get through this. Thank you!! Hopefully I never see the stuff again.",40,0

I previously lived in one where drug use was rampant and easily accessible and it was just full of drama so eventually I ended up using meth like they all were

I'm here for myself; hopefully someone else can relate to this and know they aren't alone. Also, its going to be so cool to look back at this one day and see everything I've overcome from this addiction. Also, also, this post is getting long~


Aug. 15th, 2021

Huge note: Every decision I have made is my own fault, no one else's. I'm not here to put the blame on anyone or anything, im here to just complain and vent about myself and my problems. If you read the whole things there's a bunch of positive updates at the end ❤

~I understand Meth is bad for you... obviously.. its literal fucking meth, which is why im actively seeking help and opening up about my addiction. ALSO I know things can be so much worse, no one will let me forget about how much worse things could be. As of now though, this is my reality and I just want to complain about shit cause its not been good and I don't have really anyone to talk to right now. Thx so much~

For reference: I started using in February of 2021 (about 6 Mos of use). I'm 22 y/o male, I have a connective tissue disorder called Ehlers Danlos Syndrome.


*Medical bullshit <3* 


1. I had pneumomediastinum, basically I popped a hole in my lung from smoking it and my chest cavity filled with a ""concerning amount of air"" and was starting to leak into my neck.
(Note: triage nurses said I was having (or had one shortly before going in) a heart attack)

2. I had an infection in the pad of my finger (called a felon) from a broken meth pipe and almost lost my finger 

3. I got a sinus infection from snorting it. I was getting copious amounts of fresh and clotted blood from my sinus cavities, I couldn't bend over for about 2 weeks without the pressure feeling like it was going to break my nose, and towards the end I was blowing neon orange out of my nose (my dad saw and confirmed that was the color)
(Note: I tore a membrane around my brain or something during my sinus infection and I've been leaking cerebrospinal fluid from my nose.)

4. I thought the jaundice I experienced after using was just ""bad lighting""... it turns out I have symptomatic hepatitis B and they recently found its chronic.
(Note: I have IBS so I ignored a lot of the 'gut' symptoms because I honest to god thought it was just my IBS.)

5. I broke my knuckle on my index finger a couple weeks before I started using, it took months to heal because of the meth use and I can't bend it fully anymore

6. My memory has just gone to shit. 

7. My nostrils collapse now so it's incredibly hard to breathe if I don't keep my head elevated while laying down.
(Note: I was having dreams where it was hard to breathe and would startle myself awake gasping for air. I didn't know what was happening until I went to clear my nose by inhaling really hard and they both just closed in.)

8. My mental health has just declined rapidly, its very hard to care about anything. Even when my body is begging me to stop, my mind wants more.
(Big note: I am okay, I am safe, I have no thoughts of self harm or anything like that I promise ❤ I am learning how to take control of my mind and separate my thoughts (if that makes sense))


Aug. 29th 2021

9. Apparently my kidneys are fucked up and they aren't expelling acids from my body. I thought my pee was burning from an STD (cause ya boy gets around), turns out my piss is just basic. They aren't exactly sure what's going on, but im not in immediate danger from it and I need to just keep a very close eye on it. 


10. I have a very big, very hard, but painless mass in the right side of my abdomen. It doesn't really move unless you push down on it, then it just shifts really hard back to where it was resting (I'm guessing). I noticed it like 2 months ago but thought it was from constipation cause it wasn't ""up"" for more than a day or two. It was ""staying down"" for a while until like 5 days ago, it will still shift if you press on it but it always comes back up. 
(Note: this is the first thing im bringing up to my new doctor. Also im not even sure this is from meth use)


11. My right shoulder is getting worse and honestly I have no idea what to do for it. I've tried everything and nothing is easing the resting pain, my range of motion has dramatically decreased, and I can't move it without it ""catching"" (getting stuck) and having to pop it to uncatch it. Whenever it pops it's incredibly loud (people always say something about it) and it's incredibly painful, like bring-ya-to-your-knees kind of pain. 
(Note: I'll most likely talk to my surgeon and see what he wants to do. I think this might have something to do with my recent meth use but it could also just be good timing??)


12. My left ear started bleeding?? This literally happened last night while I was talking to my sister in the kitchen. My right ear did something similar when I had an ear infection so im going to treat it like that. I plan on going to urgent care tomorrow though just to be safe. 
(Note: 100% from meth use, this literally never happened before I started using.) 


Not gonna lie I've recently accepted that my body is just slowly shutting down lol. It sucks but everything, in theory, can be fixed and cured. I'm not going to stress about these things though, it'll just make things worse. However, I'm not ignoring my problems either.


 this is what I have volunteerly put myself through for Meth, and fuck that shit.


Aug. 15th, 2021

 SO HERES SOME POSITIVE STUFF GOING ON!!!! 
 ~I have shoulder surgery at the end of this month and it's my first surgery in a long line of surgeries happening over the next few years. Some to fix the damage I've done to myself from using Meth, some to fix problems I've been living with for years. Honestly I'm so fucking excited for them, it's a big motivator for me to stop using. 
 ~ I am (very slowly) starting to do better, the in-between time frames of using are getting longer, the cravings are incredibly strong but they are weakening! Honestly the impulse decision to use after not using for a week or longer is my biggest downfall during recovery. Baby steps though. 
 ~During recovery from my surgeries I am going to start online school so I don't lose my progress. I was getting a degree in welding but now am going for engineering, since I won't be able to (or allowed to) weld during recovery.
  ~I live with my parents and they don't know I use (they probably do but I will continue to live blisfully oblivious until I tell them). I did recently tell my sister everything and she has been my biggest supporter through this and I couldn't be more thankful. 

Otherwise this has very much been a one-man-army type situation and it's been very hard. Things will get better sooner than later, I just really needed to get all of this off my chest. Thank you ❤

Updates ~ Not so happy first, to rip the bandaid off.

 My surgery was canceled because of my Hepatitis B (totally understandable) probably 3 days after I posted this originally. I was already a week+ clean at this point and kind of had a mental breakdown when it happened and I used again... I used 3 seperate times over the course of a week and a half.  I've waited 10 years to get my shoulders fixed and having it canceled even after staying clean and doing everything I was supposed to, it absolutely destroyed me.  But now I need to accept the fact that:

 1) I used again and fell back into my pattern

 2) my surgery is canceled, for now.  I need to keep moving forward though. 


It honestly breaks my heart about my surgery, but I've lived with my random shoulder dislocations for literally over a decade. A few more months or even a year won't be the end for me. I've also recognized what my ""pattern"" is and some of my triggers for using. I honestly think that, just even acknowledging these things, is going to play a big role in me quitting for good. Something I've noticed as well, is that after using the past few time, im in so much physical pain I can't function for a day or two. It's mainly Liver and Kidney pain that radiates strongly to my back, with a lot of joint pain.  ITS VERY BAD DO NOT GET ME WRONG but it's definitely helping a lot with not wanting to use anymore. 

Updates ~ very happy things! 

I finally have a new primary care doctor and see her on the 11th!  I go to my first group meeting Tuesday!  I'm also registering for online classes through Sophia on Sept. 1st!  I have almost finished my ceremony speech for my friends wedding (it's going to be based around plants <3) and im super proud of it! Im also finally going to get back on a schedule of some kind, which is going to help a lot with my mental health! My parents also got horses and they're super sweet and I love them <3

Probably the best thing though, my motivation to not use is becoming a thing finally!!!!  There's nothing profound behind the newly found motivation, there's nothing *special* about it, it's just kind of there and it's nice.  It's a small voice in my head right now, but it definitely has been growing a lot. 


Thank you for the support and just reading this in general ❤ I don't know if it's helping anyone, if it is though, then Good! I'm glad I can be apart of your healing process!! It truly means a lot to me and im always open to talk to anyone. No one should go through this alone ❤ it really helps me to open up about this crazy shit going on too not gonna lie. Things will get better though! Small victories are still victories.",33,5

The problem is that I'm trying to not do stims (because I always end up binging) and being around someeone who is always *so* ready to do it, and even trying to convince other people to do it (not in pushy way, he respects my boundaries but still being offered it so much isn't good for me either).
I feel like if I try to adress how serious this problem is, I'll just be met with a response a long the lines of ""you were so much worse and you turned out okay""  or a whole bunch of other excuses (because so far every attempt I've made was met with an excuse). I guess I feel guilty because I'm not even good at stopping stims myself, it feels weird to try to stop someone else. And bad too. It's really fucking with my sobriety. Which I have in fact lost now due tot this whole situation (not blaming my friend personally, this is the last thing he'd want).
I'm just lost, idk how I can help him before it's too late and he ends up being just like me. A ""casual"" binge user who completely destroys himself once every month or so for days on end and then cries in shame.

Because I know exactly what this is: it's all harmless fun now, a few exceptions here and there, maybe a few times too close together, just one more line at the end of the night (or just one more?)... It's like I'm seeing video footage of myself and it's frightening. Sure, now everything is okay, but I know from personal experience how quickly can turn from okay to hell and it's frustrating that they don't want to hear that.

I work in software -- a notoriously competitive industry -- and at this point in my career, I simply can't afford major lapses in productivity. Obviously, this has been a massive challenge, what with my having spent the better part of last year constantly hitting the meth sauce.

Caffeine has historically been my go-to crutch but let's be honest, caffeine sucks. Any energy I can glean from coffee or energy drinks is jittery and short-lived. It keeps me from falling asleep face-first in lunch pasta and that's about it.

Modafinil, on the other hand, actually helps me get shit done. It keeps me awake, focused and organized. It's not a fun drug: there's no orgasmic euphoria or any maddening surge of motivation. But there's also no debilitating comedowns or compulsive redosing; no rage, no obsessions and no porn marathons.

It negatively impacted my relationship with myself, with my SO, and with every other important person in my life.

In June 2020 I was laid off of work due to COVID. This actually provided me with an opportunity to get clean while I also continued my job hunt.

Quitting Adderall was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I’d been using it to cover up my personal shortcomings like self loathing and inability to draw boundaries. When I finally got clean, all that shit was laid bare. 

My confidence completely plummeted. It was like I’d been living on another planet and now that I was back home, I was seeing everything I’d done in a new light. 

I couldn’t remember words I wanted to use, the sentences I formed were non-functional, I was exhausted and so HUNGRY. I gained about 20 lbs. My creativity plummeted.

I know its so difficult. I’m sorry you’ve gotten to this place and that now you must overcome. But trust me when I say it’s so worth it to quit. You can do it. Your excuses are simply the drug talking. You will absolutely experience some troubling times and it will be tough, but you will recover and be so pleased with yourself

I am new here. I have struggled with a heavy meth addiction for four years now.  My addiction has cost me so much, and after years of daily use, I finally managed to get a few weeks clean under my belt.  I was fortunate enough to have an opportunity to travel across the country for a couple of weeks to visit a family member. Because of this time away from my hometown, I was FINALLY able to get off the drugs. I didn't think that would ever be possible with how bad it truly was, but I did it, and I experienced what life can be sober. It felt wonderful, I was so thankful to be freed from that constant ""chase"" that owned my life during my active addiction. After returning home, I slipped a couple of times and then pulled out of it and was sober for three weeks. While three weeks sober doesn't sound like a whole heck of a lot of time, for me it is a huge victory. However, this past week  I have been using again roughly every other day.  The anxiety and depression that comes with using is horrific. I don't want to give up and go back to the misery that comes with using. It felt so much better being sober. I'm trying so hard to just focus on today. I'm confident I can stay sober for today. I'm extremely nervous for tomorrow though, my current living environment makes it far too easy to fall right back into my old patterns. I am open to any advice or suggestions anyone may have.

I've been taking dextroamphetamine for about 4-5 months now. At first just occasionally and at sensible doses, but for the past 2-3 months I've been abusing it regularly.

I'm at the point where my tolerance is insanely high (150mg some days) and the effects have gone from positive to horrible. I feel like a zombie all day, feel frozen and disinterested in anything else, extreme guilt etc. I'm no longer experiencing any positive effects no matter the dose.

This has turned into a nightmare, I'm destroying my relationships with those who care about me and my mental health because of this issue and I'm ready to stop. I'm quickly losing all my money as well.

How should I go about quitting? Only 2 months ago I went a few days without the drug and it wasn't that bad at all, very manageable. Since then however my tolerance has grown and so have my doses, and the few times I've had to take a couple days off have been miserable (sleeping all day, can't get out of bed etc.)

Should I just quit cold turkey, or wean myself off? I'm determined to do it myself. Approximately how long does the worst phase of the withdrawal (extreme fatigue, inability to do anything) last, i.e. when will I become somewhat functional? And how likely is it I've done permanent damage to my brain? I'm hoping I haven't since the duration of use was short (especially of regular dose), but the abuse was pretty bad (on average I'd say I was taking 80-100mg a day at the end, occaaionally snorting). 

Any advice is appreciated, thanks.",5,0

I am now over 60 hours clean of any stimulants. I have used Methamphetamin ""only"" three times in the past four weeks. I used ""normal"" Amphetamin around three times in the same time frame, but mostly as a strong replacement for caffein. My first use of meth was actually exactly four weeks ago. Thinking that I´d only use it in a controlled setting and small doses, I used it the first two times as an aid for studying. Now last weekend I thought ""well I finished my degree in European Social Law and all the exams have almost perfect grades, why not use the rest of the Methamphetamin recreationally? I mean you only finish your academic carrier once right?""  
Well since I am an idiot and was only thinking about partying hard with the largest reward possible I took around 100mg Meth as an initial dose (my dosage for studying were around 30-40mg) and even redosed with around 150mg 8 hours later. (intranasal)  
Long Story short I experienced double vision for a short time and because I panicked that I overheated I instantly started to cool myself with wet towels for the following hours. Later my Muscels began to cramp and hurt, I felt dizzy, I had a tingeling sensation over all my limbs and head, I had short breath and generally I just felt aweful. But I thought of drinking enough and tried to eat a few bites of mixed salad, even though every bite made me almost gag.   
The symptoms didnt subside the next day. I panicked, thinking that I had damaged my brain and organs because of an overdose, or close to an overdose and even called the paramedics. Since they didnt find any arrhythmia and basic cognitive functions were present they told me to just sit it out and left again. 

Now almost 3 days later after the last dose I still have no appetite, I can barely sleep and even if I do I wake up two to three hours later, my muscles still cramp from time to time, I am short of breath, my pulse while writing this is around 80, but if I even think about walking 4 meters it spikes to over 100, I cant concentrate on anything and my memory slips through my head like sand through the fingers. But the worst symptoms of all are the depression, the anxiety that these symptoms are permanent or I may have permanent damage and short panick attacks. Most of the time these happen when I try to sleep, but cant. Then I get frustrated and desperate because I am really exhausted and then I get anxiety and depression because I cant sleep and so on and so forth.

I am 100% comitted to stop taking any stimulants period. Even detroyed any leftovers and tools (like fine scales). But these withdrawal symptoms are really getting to me. Especially the fact that I cant get any sleep. Its not like I dont get any joy from anything right now. I still like to watch a netflix series or play a few games or talk to my sister, but the fact that I cant concentrate on anything and feel completly exhausted really is pulling a toll on me. I dont even have cravings for any drugs what so ever (yet?). Quite the opposite, I feel sick just thinking about drinking an energy drink or god forbid snort some speed. 

To those of you who have quitted Amphetamins as well: How long did it take until the hardest of symptoms were gone or how long until the general exhaustion was gone?

I dont know whether I am lucky to have not used as much of stimulants in general or if I am unlucky (or rather an idiot) for using a hardcore stimulant like Meth in such a way... In either way",9,0

I went to the assessment thinking I would see a psychiatrist or psychologist and be able to access psychological support as I’d been experiencing issues at work and bad depression. 

At the actual assessment I was seen by two nurses who I was not aware at the time were allowed to prescribe medication. This is in the UK. The whole time they pushed vyvanse as the only treatment they could offer me. I said I wasn’t interested as I wasn’t even studying at the time and managed my job okay apart from being bullied and gaslit by managers which I thought a diagnosis would protect me from. I was told that I needed to trial medication in order to receive a diagnosis and had nothing to worry about from trying it. I said I was wary about stimulants as even two cups of coffee used to make me feel agitated and unwell. They reassured me that I would be given a very low dose and didn’t need to worry about getting addicted as it’s a pro drug. In terms of side effects they didn’t mention anything apart from to remember to eat enough and that I might get a bit of a dry mouth.

I was prescribed 30mg which is actually the maximum prescribed starting dose, unbeknownst to me at the time. Initially I decided not to take them until a couple of weeks later when I’d been struggling to focus on a book I was reading because of a lot of background noise in my house. I decided to try one and was amazed at the sense of being totally immersed in whatever I was doing regardless of what was going on in the background. I had not been prepared for the emotional effects of the drug; the euphoria, mania, subsequent crash etc. I had a history of depression and low self-esteem so obviously the effects were quite overwhelming for me. I had never taken recreational drugs except weed and alcohol before so I didn’t understand the nature of addiction or how to recognise I was in it.

After a few days the feelings of depression and irritability began to overshadow any positives I’d been experiencing so I decided to stop. I explained this to the prescriber over the phone but his response was that I should try taking 50mg instead as he inferred that the awful crashes I’d been experiencing were down to being on too low a dose. In hindsight this sounds absurd but I trusted him at time and followed his advice.

Logically starting again at 50mg without tolerance led to even worse side effects. But I quickly found that without taking them I struggled to focus on or enjoy anything I used to. Following this was a four or five month long battle with myself where I struggled every day with the cognitive dissonance of wanting to continue feeling the effects of the drug but at the same time being aware of the detrimental effects on my mental and physical health. I’d compare it to letting the most emotionally abusive, manipulative person imaginable live rent free in your head. You are made to feel like you could do anything for four hours and then beaten down and told you’re the most worthless pos on the planet until you take your next dose.

I eventually summoned the courage to bin everything I had left and sever contact with the prescriber. However, I was still left with a litany of consequences for my health. I had lost nearly a stone in weight, had terrible anhedonia, depression, tinnitus and worst of all severe tmj pain and muscle cramps all over my neck and shoulders.

I eventually had to leave my job because of side effects of other medications I’d taken to try and manage these symptoms. I made a formal complaint against the nurse who originally prescribed me lisdexamphetamine earlier this year. I recently had a response from the service which essentially put the onus on me stating it was my choice to take it and that no one was forcing me. This feels completely unfair. If a doctor prescribes addictive medication such as opiates or benzos they would be expected to carefully monitor treatment and determine appropriate dosages. I don’t understand why they feel it was acceptable to ply me with amphetamines, leave me to my own devices and then blame me when I ran into problems. I feel completely devastated and suicidal over this.",20,0

As long as Im abusing the adderall I should just accept that this weight of regret and shame on my shoulders is here to stay. I just need some positive uplifting and maybe if I can feel good about myself I wont need to use them incorrectly. Or maybe ultimately I need to quit them because I am an addict. I hate that about myself...",3,0

I am aware Meth and amphetamines in general are addictive, especially for non ADHD users. I have ADHD and whilst Meth does relieve the symptoms of my ADHD...I do plan on quitting. Fuck this drug and how addictive it is. Fuck the cravings, the dry mouth, the skin picking, the paranoia, the delirium ect. I will get clean and hopefully I can find another way to treat my ADHD. I hate myself for what I have done. I should have never tried this drug. This is 110% my fault and no one elses. I chose to try meth in order to treat my ADHD because I couldn't obtain standard pharmaceuticals. Big fat fucking mistake. I am only 2 weeks in. If I quit now it would be easier. In spite of this I try to be a responsible. I shower, hydrate, and sleep. I am not the best at eating and sleeping as much as I should but I do my best.

I fantasize about a nearly fairytale resolution to my boring and unhealthy life.  -
Me and the guy I like fall in love, stop using drugs, and i lose 200 pounds
He eventually becomes a spiritual guru of sorts and he overcomes his mental illness by sheer willpower and meditation.
I stop being super morbidity obese and get down to a normal weight.  We thrive together and live as close to happily ever after as possible 
Dreaming of this outcome whilst shoveling more drugs in my body and just laying here in bed wondering if my time is soon.
I think the guy I like is too untamable to be confined within a closely knit monogamous relationship.  He is magical but he won’t want to devote so much energy into just one person

I don’t wanna be like this anymore. 

I was given Zyprexa and Depakote while I was inpatient. but I stopped because of side effects. 

Tried zyprexa again thinking maybe i blamed the meds for symptoms caused by damaged dopamine receptors. But I just can’t handle the side effects.

Is there anything else that could help prevent an impulsive relapse? Naltrexone and Bupropion?

And I’ve read Depakote could help but I also read it can permanently fuck you up.

I’ve been sober off adderall addiction for about almost 7 months now and my life has improved dramatically. I’ve moved out of my parents house, got an amazing job, and pay for my own apartment in the city, dumped my loser bc, among other things. 

The only thing left I’m struggling with is the weight I’ve gained from quitting. It came on pretty fast and I’ve been trying to eat healthy and workout lately but i sometimes wish I had adderall again cause I know I’d lose like 15 pounds in no time and I feel so insecure with how I look.

I'm really uncomfortable talking about my struggles with addiction.  Let's just say I rarely do anything just a little bit.  I was a hard case teetering on the high functioning edge for well over a decade until I fell into a slump that gave me a choice.  That choice was to make a change or die.  What I didn't realize years ago was that you don't make that choice once, it's every single day.

Reset after reset on my sobriety counter. Time after time of ""this is the last time"". Today, I say no more.

I was on my way to use tonight when, after kissing my mom goodnight, she sent me a text ending with ""You are my heart."" Then it was like the universe tried to send as many possible alarm bells at once as possible.

A meaningful song that I relate to with my addiction auto played right after I read ""my heart"", the current time was my lucky numbers, too much to tell here, but everywhere I looked I saw things meaningful to me screaming LOUDLY at me to stop.

The universe has sent me so many warnings and I have faced the repercussions of living hell every single damn time. I ignore the alarms, relapse anyway, and pay the price dearly.

I just finished watching the movie ""Four Good Days"". It hollowed me to my core seeing the mother be so similar on many levels to my mom. I was almost a month clean until 3 days ago. 4 years clean when I relapsed in May. I've relapsed at least 9 times since May. Not a single person in my life knows. I don't have anyone I can tell without devastating them to their core.

I will NOT lose the unwavering trust and unfaltering love from my mother.

Meth has taken away moments in my life that were priceless. Meth is insidious and pervasive. I was a straight a and b student, an honor student. I was the poster boy for the anti drug campaign and yet how far I have fallen. If meth can destroy my life, I promise it can destroy yours too.

Today I say no more. No more. God willing, no more.

Okay so this morning I've hit the 3 day mark so I'm a bit clunky. Spends almost the entire day waiting for a friend to respond a few times to my texts. We usually did this garbage together and we'd video call for hours upon hours. 

He's not answering so I sent my ex(no closure for almost 2 years) a message saying she looks great and I'm so happy for her. She struggled with depression back when we had the title of couple. She replies with the usual thanks and all of those, but then asks how I'm doing. 

I tell her that I'm basically back to square one, but a bit worse off. She immediately knew what was going on, and totally flipped on me. After about an hour of her raging at me out of disgust, she noticed that I was in some sort of delusion. I asked her how can I stop. Only thing I could understand was her literally drawing a picture of me and the meth separated, as well as the other friends.

Now I'm sitting here with the girl of my dreams back in my life, telling me to quit. I wanted to quit about a month ago, but never had that drive. 

This is it everyone. I'm done. I can't wait for my new life. I have quit once for a year and a half but never saw the world getting it's color back.

Summer is here and I wonder whether I want to score again. Cause something inside me is telling me that I enjoy being part of that community. I found the power of Meth fascinating and I really am tempted. 

Throught the last year I have been in a wonderful relationship, doing school work, healed my mental trauma caused by Meth, almost started engaging in music again, feel like a human. Yet I want to rape my brain again. Why? Why do I like being addicted? 

Even though I didn't use Meth in a long time. I every day smoke weed, do kratom and drink. Just for the sake of it. It still fascinates me the chemistry, the experiences, the culture, the suffering. 

Something drives me to experience different states of mind and I love it. Yet I don't want to relapse cause I love myself my life and know it's not healthy.

Just to give you a bit of my background, I have used meth for 4 years now. I started out smoking then it's gone down hill from there. I generally suffer from low self esteem and when I use I loved how it made me feel.

Well the honeymoon phases only lasts for so long. Now when I use I experience bad psychosis. So bad that I've been traumatized. Despite the severe negative effects from meth I still want to do some more.

The biggest reason why I have a difficult time breaking this horrid addiction is because I enjoy the energy it provides and I enjoy working on stuff. I'm very worried about this mindset I have. But it's very true and this really bothers me.

Deep down I know that I need to quit but if this is the case I feel like a part of me dies. When I'm not using I am very lazy and I have no motivation to do anything. I try to push myself when I am sober but the excitement is non existent.

Does anyone have this problem? Let's say you love working on cars too being a painter who loves being creative. How on earth can I manage too have any motivation whatsoever? I don't want to give up on my hobbies either.",11,0
