I’m attending NA meetings, but haven’t been going as much as I was in the first month. I have my issues with the program and philosophy, but I do get something from meeting other addicts and hearing their stories. Plus it gives me something to do lol. It’s lonely in recovery but I put myself here. I pushed everyone away in my addiction and I’m reaping what I sowed. I love this community, it’s helped immensely. I just want you all to know that quitting that shit is tough and we are some bad motherfuckers. No matter if you’re actively using and wanting to quit, clean for a day or a decade, keep fighting the good fight. Be nice to each other but most importantly be nice to yourself.

Dropped outta school and played video games all day and sexted girls. I eventually quit, and the first year I was truly convinced I was retarded. I lost all my social skills due to drug abuse. Couldn't really function or drive. Still found myself staring in the mirror for some reason picking at my face even though I was clean. And every day felt like the first day until I said I needed help. I went to sober living. Then relapsed on Benzedrex because it was all I had. Ended up in rehab at 19. And now I'm out and in sober living again. Even though my roommates are understanding, they still think I'm slow. I stare at the wall, sleep all day, and basically do nothing at all. I keep getting fired from jobs for not being fast pace enough. And do nothing but chain smoke. And I'm just wondering when this pain will end. I then realized. If opioid addicts get put on maintenance meds then why can't a tweaker. So I tried some antidepressants and straterra and other crap. The only thing that's helped is Lamictal and Abilify. But even then I still have to have(not exaggerating) 4 bang energy drinks before I get outta bed. But even though this has been my life. I'm still trying. I can't dig the hole any deeper or shit will be even worse than it is right now and has been. Reality is a bitch, but I just wanted to share this to vent and maybe help someone know their not alone.

2021-06-29 11:59:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/oab7a8/this_isnt_sustainable/,This isn't sustainable.,"Hey everyone,

Prescribed Adderall for some years, but never took them very consistently because I am an opioid addict and know how detrimental adderall is.  

Well, I came off of opioids about 2 months ago, with a small 3 day relapse a month ago. I decided to use my meds as prescribed, 40-60mgs per day. Been on them for a couple of months. 

My fucking joints hurt, my skin has cystic acne, oily as hell, and my heart feels fucked all the time. I can't sustain this even though I'm sleeping and eating regularly. 

I'm in the worst health of my life and dreading the withdrawal, plus on top of that, it's been covering up the dreaded opioid withdrawals/PAWS, so I know when I jump off tomorrow, it is all going to come rushing back. No tapering, I'm just fucking done with it. I have scars from the acne that popped up from this garbage and pissed. 

I know it isn't anything comparable to what you guys are going through with big meth habits. I have no idea how people stay on this fucking poison. 

Couple of questions:

I am prescribed gabapentin, never take them consistently because fuck gaba withdrawals. Has anyone ever utilized this for adderall withdrawal? 

What can I expect from this withdrawal of taking 40-60mgs per day for 2 months? I have about 4 days to get through this, will I still be extremely fucked after this short time frame?

I have shrooms for microdosing and also LSD. When can I start utilizing these to help with the depression and withdrawal?

Any advice would be helpful. Thanks.",11

I was proud of myself and thought I had my addiction under control.  But I recently realized that my battle has only begun.  I'm still very selfish and only think of things through my own personal lens.  I have a wife and two children that I absolutely adore.  But over the past year I've been lying to my wife after she asked me not to stay in contact with my former drug dealer, who happened to be one of my close friends growing up.  We texted maybe 3 times over the year, and it didn't have anything to do with drugs; but I still did that behind her back and rationalized it by saying ""we were friends before using, and I don't want to totally cut him out of my life"".  Besides this example, I find that I often put myself first and don't consider other people.  I thought I was a good dad (other people, including my wife said this too, so it's not totally made up), but I realized that part of being a good dad is being a good, considerate husband; and I have not been that.

Has anybody else noticed these tendencies within themselves?  If so, has anything helped you be more empathetic, considerate, and less selfish?  Thanks for your time in reading this.  This is my first time posting but long time lurking.",17

Wasn't related to his death at all, but he was always disapproving and worried of my use; especially when i picked it back up after promising him I'd stop, after our best friend died from OD (opiates).  
   I feel like a shitty friend to him for this, but truthfully he didnt hate me for it. He understood what I was going through, and kind of gave me a pass. I guess he figured that it was better than when I was using heroin. Honestly after i picked coke up again it was in the name of dropping H forever. Fuck that shit. 
    Well it didn't work out that way. I ended up falling into a near daily 4 month long binge. I blew so much money, put my body at risk and I wasnt myself. It helped me get my house chores done and my sex drive (which is non existent, im in my 20's and it sucks.) 
   My best friend passed and I finished my shit and didnt pick it up again; i went 3 months without using...until today. 
    Saw my junkie family member and she just offered me a bump and i just said yes before i could think ""probably shouldn't"" or ""i stopped"". One bump turned into like 4 lines (which honestly, isn't that much compared to my binge  use). 
    Totally fulfilled my craving I've had for *months*....i fucking missed that rush. Don't like the come down but, 4 lines really wasn't much of one since I took some xanax and did some dabs. 
    I don't want to go down that road again. I don't want to have to hide my problem from my SO. I don't want to deal with the comedowns again. I really don't...there's something fucking wrong with me. How, after everything that has happened can I be thinking about ""well maybe just a gram and thats it"".
   The *hell* is wrong with me?
*Why* can't I resist the urge? 
I almost even crave heroin again. Why would I want to make myself sick again? I wish I wasn't always craving drugs. I don't want to disrespect my late best friend, but I already contacted the connect. 
    Its like, I don't wanna go through the bad parts, but I REALLY love doing coke, and all my friends are dead anyways, so whose to stop me? And why does it even matter. 
    I know thats depressing but, i don't know. I cant handle all the grief, the stress of just life, my mental health being absolute garbage. Its just bullshit. 
Hopefully I can say no this time.

To add on; i just really dont feel like I will ever be motivated without it. I am so depressed. Im off my meds, but even when I was on them I still ended up using heroin, abusing xanax and ambien, and eventually cocaine. I dont know how, or if i will ever stop craving fucking myself up. I dont want to be here. Honestly, i am so scared to end up like so many of my friends that arent with me anymore. On the flip side, i dont care about myself that much.",24

Hey y'all,

Last time I posted on here was during my last relapse and well, it happened again. Somehow, adderall found me on vacation out in a Minnesota town of 1,000 people. I was introduced to a good friend of my friends and his brother had adderall. In my drunken state, as soon as he mentioned that word the gears started turning again. He is not aware of my past of addiction so he didn't hesitate to give me two. After it hit me 30 minutes later, I literally started salivating for more. I asked, he said no, so while he wasn't looking I grabbed the pill bottle, took 2 more, and pocketed 2 for later. 

&#x200B;

I don't understand myself, and I don't understand this. How can my mind's barriers against addiction be instantly broken down by someone SAYING the word adderall?? That feeling I got from taking the adderall initially was other worldly. I felt like I was back to my old, happy and giddy self again who could talk to anyone or make anyone laugh. I felt like a god compared to what I have been feeling like these past few months I need this comedown to whoop my ass again so I can scare myself straight into not doing it again, and I am afraid it wont. I just stole from a guy I barely knew and it was medication someone actually needed. I just don't even know what to say for myself at this point. I don't feel like I have the ability to create a life that is without drugs and alcohol anymore. Sober life is fucking miserable 98% of the time. Everything I do in my life feels half-assed even though that's all the energy I have to do it. I don't care about anything when I'm sober. I am so used to self sabotage that I refuse to do anything helpful to help me move forward in life. Taking this adderall was the only thing that could get my head above the dark and stormy waters that is my life. I never ever steal from anyone yet I betrayed his trust and snuck a few more. I don't know what to do. I guess I have to face the music which is the horrid adderall comedown in a few hours. 

Stay safe everyone, thanks for reading.

Obviously my adderall was more important and hell my 4 shirts, a couple of shorts, and 7 socks got me through just fine.

But I quit and I look like a bum and I deserve to look good and have a nice wardrobe. So to the mall I go.

But I have no money. Really nothing. I knew that I couldn't bring anything home.

But just going in and trying on these crisp, trendy new clothes, and seeing how good I was wearing them did so much. For years I've looked in the mirror seeing the same sad dude in the same raggedy ass clothes looking back at me. 

I wasn't seeing new clothes that I could buy if I keep it up,  I was seeing a new me, a better looking me. And just contemplating which clothes I like tie most made me realize that I have the freedom of choice. In a few weeks I can buy those clothes. Or instead buy new bedding. Hell can go hiking in the fucking rocky mountains and enjoy the beauty of nature before fall.

I can do all of those things and millions more, or I can use. I'm Dumbfounded at how I forgot that I can choose to do so many things and that I have a say in what my life experiences will be.

These are such obvious simple things that people know and do all the time just to enjoy life. Duh, that's living - wanting something, working to get it, getting it,  experiencing it for what it is, and then move on to whatever you want next  

Here I am with this one dimensional inner struggle between ""get some pills man you need it,"" and ""no I can't keep wasting everything on binges and crashes""

All I saw was, either I use, or i don't use. 

Guys. We can use, or we can literally do whatever the fuck else we want. We can use, or we can go on vacation. We can use, or we can meet new friends. We can use, or we can learn a new skill. We can use, or we can have a good love life. We can use, or we can start a family. We can use, or we can get the world. 

It's almost laughable that I forgot that I want stuff other than drugs. I don't even want the drugs. And I sure as fuck don't want the hookers whose ads I look up for hours on ent l end. 

I have experiences and likes and humor and wisdom and empathy and love and a fucking lust for life and connection to people and society and our fucking planet. And I can get it, it' all just there for us right in front of our noses.

I’ve been really killing it this year. Top grades at University, Work is good, family is good and I’m planning on buying a house soon. 

I have schizophrenia, BPD and CPTSD. Which are all good.

I also quit smoking cigarettes and alcohol about 4 months ago. 

So I looked at the medication (neuroleptics/antipsychotics and benzos). I cut them down and got off them, but about 4 weeks later I was in a full blown psychotic state and extremely suicidal. 

I got back on my meds 2 weeks ago. But in the meantime to cope I’m back on cigarettes and alcohol which I’m devastated at myself about. 

Now I’m still not right. Meds take about 6 weeks to work. Living in psychosis and suicdality until then.  

Then last night at used Meth. It was so horrific I felt like I was gonna have a stroke, I didn’t get happy high at all. It was just so shit. With psychotic features and I feel like shit. 

And here’s a he kicker, Now I wanna just do it again cause I’m angry at myself and hope I do have a fatal stroke or at the very least wanna punish myself. I am great at going on paths of self destructions when I’m in these states. 

I just wanna get put into a coma until my meds work again Btw. I did say to my counsellor that I would rather die  then take meth again and that is a real issue for me.

1. My self image dictates what my body feels.

3. Lie to yourself.

Take a shower, brush your teeth and floss.
Get a haircut, do your nails, buy great smelling body wash, shampoo. Make your self feel and smell great. Even if you aren’t going anywhere.
Drink water, eat some greens, foods high in protein and then some more water.
Get a gym membership. Even if you don’t want to lift weights. Just hit the treadmill and walk. Everyone in the gym is working on themselves and it’s good to be around people that are on the same page.
Tell yourself that it’s going to be a good day, that you’re happy, and that everything is going to be fine. Eventually all those lies will become true, because you’ve spoken it into existence.

Posting today to let you know we are running a smart meeting in the RedditInRecovery discord! It happens every friday at 9pm central.

If you've ever thought that you need a meeting but you were scared to go in person, or you went to 12 step and it didn't fit with your mindset... I encourage you to check it out.

Here's a quick writeup of the program and how the meetings go:
SMART (Self-Management And Recovery Training) Recovery

SMART is a generalized non-spiritual/non-religious addiction recovery program that is self-driven, as opposed to standard 12-step style programs, built from science-backed psycho-therapeutic techniques (e.g. CBT/DBT/REBT) that are applied in the context of addiction. 

The focus is to help and empower participants by building sensible mental tools as part of their recovery to overcome the logical fallacies, difficulties in emotional regulation and other mental roadblocks that appear during the path to recovery, no matter what stage someone is at (day 1 or day 1000).

The SMART approach is built around ""the 4-point program"":

1. Building and maintaining the motivation to change. 
2. Coping with urges to use.
3. Managing thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in an effective way without addictive behaviors. 
4. Living a balanced, positive, and healthy life.

 Meetings 

SMART meetings are best understood by looking at the meeting format. Unlike other programs, cross-talk (discussion between participants) is encouraged.

1. The meeting opens with a check-in where everyone one-by-one is invited to speak about how they are today, where they currently are in their recovery, any stressors they'd like to work on and anything else that feels relevant in the present.

2. The facilitator will ask people who are dealing with an issue to discuss it, generally inviting other participants to chime in if they have relevant experience or some thoughts, then work with the current person on teaching them (as well as the group as a whole) a tool that is applicable.

3. The meeting closes with a check out in a similar style to the check-in, where feedback is given to facilitator as well as simple how you feel and anything that may have come up that you want to ask about.

I will be 3 years clean in october from various stimulants (adderall, vyvanse, amphetamine, mdma, cocaine) and I really cannot speak highly enough about how much the tools in smart helped me deal with intense urges and cravings along the way.

Hope to see you there!",16

Due to a very unpleasant and complex situation I was forced to cold turkey and am now forced to look back on everything I have wasted/lost because of this. So much time wasted. So many events gone away. So many things never accomplished because I spent hours in my room writing lists about the things I was going (but never did) accomplish. It helped me be productive in the beginning but quickly turned into a nightmare of wasted time and a whole bunch of other issues for me. The crazy mood swings, the odd apathy it gives you at times, etc.

And because I am also currently going through what is basically a mild benzo withdrawal at the moment I literally cannot go back to speed right now. I feel like my mind has been let off of a roller coaster and I am forced to look at the wreckage of the past several years.

I regret so much. Words cannot describe the amount of regret.",55

I'm afraid of being judged by you guys but I hate my boyfriend. When we started dating I thought it was pretty clear that we were a couple if convenience. I told him him that I just wanted someone for company that I could work on my life with but I'm not looking for anything romantic since my fiance passed. He said okay.

I guess he thinks I'm leaving him because he is over the top and talks about how much he cares for me but I can't fucking stand him. It gets harder every day. I invited him to the city and paid over $400 for an Airbnb for us and he kept getting angry about how he had no money and how I wouldn't lend him any to buy a gun. He got angry that we were eating gas station food because I can't afford to take us to restaurants. He gets angry all the time, never has money, and takes all his problems out on me. And I feel guilty because I feel like I'm using him but we were upfront from the beginning. I have been looking for a place to stay almost as soon as I moved in with him and realized it was a mistake but I couldn't.

I feel like the real reason he doesn't want me to leave him is because his wallet will be leaving him. Not his girlfriend. He makes me feel like a piece of shit when I ask him why isn't he getting groceries when it's his turn and he basically told me he expects me to pay for groceries from now on. I feel used and angry and it's making me hate him. And I still feel like I'm using him because he hints I am sometimes. 

He is so draining. I'm tired of being yelled at because the weather is shitty or he's broke because he makes terrible financial decisions. I don't love him, I barely even like him at this point. I wanna leave so fucking badly. This situation isn't good for me.

I feel like I'm trapped. I hate how he constantly criticizes me. He gets angry if I ask him not to bring alcohol around me and he's angry when I let him and drink too much. He makes fun of my body and what I say. I hate how I walk on eggshells all the time. 

I think I'm close to a relapse. I wouldn't have called that guy if I didn't want to use, even after he confirmed he isn't sober. He knows that I lied to my family about where I'm living who I'm with and what my job is because they're super religious so I can't go to them for help because it would expose me. I'm just not ready to give up. 

I'm so angry at my boyfriend and I have no one to tell it to and it's eating me up when I have to act like I'm sorry because he's giving me the silent treatment. I'm not sorry. I'm so angry I'm having chest pains.

Edit: I just broke up with him.",36

Has had multiple relapses and rehab visits in the last 5 years. More recently, he's gotten recurrent psychoses regarding the whole world trying to kill him. Despite these recurrent psychoses, homelessness, separation from wife/kids, he continues to leech off my parents and use.

Me: background in psychology and in a field of medicine that is able to cater to addiction/mental health. I've always been very understanding of mental health, addiction, and giving people the benefit of the doubt because you can never understand their circumstances. A large part of this stemmed from watching my other brother (B) battle through schizophrenia and associated psychoses. It was an extremely difficult time involving jail time, and my oldest brother and I were quite affected by it when it happened about 15 years ago. 

Despite my own background, I have an extremely powerful rage brewing inside me. Even though brother A watched brother B go through psychosis and how dramatically it affected the family, he is more than willing to use. I've had to watch my parents' health deteriorate trying to clean up after his mess. The crystal has made him an entitled narcissist. The first words he asked me when I saw him after a year were ""you got any money?"" He has no regard for his kids and I've had to do my best in visiting the city as frequently as I can to act as a positive male role model to them. 

Right now, he's stabilizing from yet another psychotic episode in the hospital. I  just want to tell him to fuck off and stay away if he wants to continue to use. I just want to cut this cancer off and tell my parents and family to do the same. Its so fucking enraging dealing with him despite me being in a position to be the most understanding about his ""condition"". Why the fuck should I be okay with the family helping someone who will lie, cheat, manipulate, exploit, and steal from them? 

Sigh. Sorry to rant. Looking for some guidance from you folk.

i never wanted to quit before honestly. This is the first time. I’m an addict and i can’t change that, but i can change my decisions. I always felt hopeless because I thought after 8 days being sober since I didn’t get my energy back that I might as well not give stims up.

 I’m reaching heart attack level doses now just to get a high and I’m destroying the relationships that I know mean the world to me because of how these fucking pills make me feel. I took 400mg vyvanse and a bunch of modafanil over a 4 day bender the other day and i didnt even want to anymore I almost felt like I had to. They don’t help me anymore. 

Im running away from my problems and I’m losing everything I care about for a fake fucking feeling and I’m done. In the most fucked up way honestly what keeps stopping me from quitting is I feel like without these pills I’m not going to be able to have the confidence or be able to accomplish whatever I’ve done in the last 3 years when I’m off them. I don’t know if I’m going to be able to work thru a rehab stint with my current relationship. I feel like I won’t feel happy ever again and that I’m in too deep now - it feels like now I have to choose between feeling like shit and be a zombie on antidepressants the rest of my life because of the damage I’ve done to my brain, or just accept this is how it is for the rest of my life I just need them to feel anything from now on. 

Sometimes I’ll take a short break and start smoking some weed and I almost feel like a bit of hope is still possible to conquer this without stims but then the weed wears off and I feel even worse. 

I have no idea what to do. I can’t find help right now in my situation because I have a high responsibility job that I can’t take a break from because of people / family that depend on me. I wish I could do 2 months outpatient but I can’t. 

Im in my early 20s, in a relationship with a girl that makes me so happy and sometimes when I come down I’ll get aggressively loud and almost mentally abusive towards her and when I wake up next day i feel so disgusted with myself. I made these decisions and I went down this road. Nobody forced me. If I can make those decisions to start using then I have to be the one to decide to stop.

2021-06-16 05:11:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/o10mbz/adderall_withdrawl_tips/,adderall withdrawl tips?,"so ive been prescribed adderall for about 3.5 months now, using it for 5. i have been taking way too high of doses lately and redosing too frequently. i am prescribed 20mg XR and 10mg IR a day but most days for the last month or so i take about twice this amount. i had a busy week so i copped some 30mg IR from a buddy and have probably been averaging at least 100mg a day for a week. 

i dont plan on quitting because i have bad adhd and i need it, but i feel like i desperately need a week or two off to lower tolerance and remind myself i can live without it. i plan on exercising a bit each morning and fixing my sleep, and drinking a lot of water. i take tyrosine, magnesium, zinc, vitamin d, fish oil, and a multi daily. i did some reading and ordered a plethora of nootropics that have been used to increase dopamine receptor upregulation because from my understanding downregulation is a big part of the issue. does anyone have any other useful lifestyle or supplement tips they have found helpful?

i am absolutely dreading this and am worried i cant do it. the fact that i think i wont be able to make it a week depresses and terrifies me. would something like adrafinil help for general lethargy (cant get modafinil)

side note: i am prescribed Pristiq and I use a variety of recreational drugs semi-regularly without any one of them being used consistently except for an occasional cocaine binge. i know xanax is helpful and i have access to those and am open to taking them if i really need to but i would like to avoid depending on this

any and all tips are appreciated and needed:)",9

I traveled for work before I got out of high school doing construction and was pretty smart. Out of high school for about a year get the opportunity to go to the sunny south for a few months for work, ended up being about 8months. Love it here and got a raise so I decided to continue to work here after that. In that time I got introduced to drugs first hand and fell right in even though I was so against them due to my mother being addicted to crack since I was 16and up and I had never understood it……. But now I do my love for her has regrown tremendously. Back to the point, I’ve been smoking meth for 9-10 months now started slow then it became everyday. I do take responsibility for my addiction but I am surrounded by bad influences. The top guy above me is the one who I get it from and do it with and I just don’t know what to do. I feel so much dumber than I ever have been so I don’t want to go get a new job that I can’t do good at and I just purchased my first home a few months ago so I can’t afford to not have good steady income. My parents now friends really know what I do but I feel that they suspect it but I just can’t bring myself to tell them especially my father due to my mom. I want to get clean so I can start pursuing makeing a small Business but I need my brain back. My body is shot from constant work, smoking shit , alcohol every day and xanin almost everyday so I can get some sleep for work. It’s starting to catch up with me and I’m done feeling like shit and worrying if my body is going to make it.
(Yes I do eat plenty and hydrate and vitamins) but that only helps so much. I’ve been trying To quit.I was clean about eight days only smoked weed but then start again I don’t have any stuff at my house but I have very easy access to it From one person…… i’ve been slow down since then but definitely nowhere near where I should be or want to be…..I don’t like work, I am stressed ,bunch-of anxiety I just absolutely hate this shit. Don’t talk to my friends or fam really at all…….work and my girlfriend are the only thing that really keep me from going wayyyyyy to far. I need and help anyone has to offer me",4

I try to rationalize using by telling myself that happiness + adderall = invincibility and it feels SO manageable in my head, even though I know this is a lie. Recently relapsed on street addy and xans after about a month off them both. The speed binge lasted longer than the benzos did, but im sober again now. 

This time around I've really been taking sobriety seriously. Feeling so much better especially since I'm finally sleeping and eating again. I'm trying to keep a good attitude but I'm really worried this is just a pink cloud and it won't last forever. I hope this doesnt become a drug in it of itself. 

In general I know its early, but I got a good feeling about this time. My family wasn't the best at helping me out even though I'm blessed they gave me their love and patience. But I'm 21 now and just started my internship today. I'm lucky I made it out for now, but I gotta learn how to be an adult. Learn how to live too. I can't run away from my shit anymore ive wasted too much of my youth. I gotta make some friends and make sure NEVER to find excuses to skip social gatherings just to go on a speed bender making music I don't even end up finishing. I gotta remember my dreams cause everytume I use, I slowly forget how vivid they used to be. 

Anyway, this sub really helped me this last week. Since I've joined the sub I've been trying to catch when I kid myself into thinking I don't have a problem. This group was the cherry on top to helping me admit that. Even more so than zoom outpatient rehab. Hope you're all doing well and thanks for reading my little shpeal.

I'll be clean of stimulants for weeks and weeks,  feeling okay, balanced, fairly motivated and energized, mood relatively stable. And all of a sudden I get this super intense craving.

I suddenly get so excited and it's all I can think about for a few hours.

For me this is the hardest part of quitting:   the days/weeks immediately after quitting, feel so shitty physically and mentally,  that it turns me off of using stims. I just don't feel like it at that point because they've "" punished""  me so much. But then when I feel good again, and my life is doing okay,  I get these cravings. And I feel like I've "" earned""  it beacuse my life is doing good again.

I've really improved my skills in managing stress, forgiving myself, avoiding being around stims and having them nearby, and taking care of my body after abusing stims. But the one thing I still suck at is simply resisting these urges when I'm feeling good. I wish I could understand either what causes them (what the trigger is)  or how to "" get rid""  of them.

Here are my experiences

Days 1 and 2:
These days SUCKED completely and I couldn’t really do anything, I ate a ton of food all the time, but was never able to have a bowel movement. I also had hiccups that just wouldn’t go away, which actually lasted into day 3. I know this sounds like a weird and minor symptom but it got really painful and annoying, nothing could stop them, they were nonstop for days. No idea why other than maybe overeating.

Day 3:
If days 1 and 2 were bad, this day was straight hell. I had no mental clarity this day at all, it felt like I didn’t even have a self, I was just jumbled thought in a very uncomfortable body. I could barely think, I just did everything automatically like my life was on autopilot. 

Days 4-5:
Last 2 days where I lived on the couch. These days were better. I could still feel really bad withdrawals but I had mental clarity to some extent and was able to do some things. I started feeling more genuine like I was in a mental state that I had earned, unlike taking adderall and being put into a mental state that’s not earned. This was my first glimpse into what the future would feel like. 

Days 6-7:
These days concluded my first week! Overall I felt better than days 4 and 5 and I can absolutely do activities, it’s just really difficult to do them. I was pretty depressed and overall just felt uncomfortable, like I was missing any kind of satisfaction.

Days 8-10:
Worlds better than days 1-3. I am starting to be able to function in normal life again. The only effects I feel now are fatigue, mild depression, which I can only describe as reminiscing on the past and knowing that it’ll never happen again, increased appetite, shortened attention span, less focus, and other things along those lines. But all these things, about 90% of the time, are mild enough to function through. I just am afraid that the rest of my life will feel like this. I know I shouldn’t think like that, so I’m going to be super patient. I hope that I will feel “normal” again. I’m sure I’ll be able to get there eventually.",10

He had a rough up bringing and started smoking pot, taking mushrooms and acid, benzos…but when he discovered adderall it was game over. Last year he was in the midst of a bender of sorts. I called him and he was just gone. He was saying all types of crazy stuff about the color spectrum and it just made absolutely no sense. His mom and I finally convinced him to go to a rehab facility, and for about 6 months he was doing great. He was on some antidepressants and antipsychotics, although I don’t know what they were. He had a job doing deliveries.

Then yesterday I text him to see how he’s doing. He’s not well and had doctor shopped and found someone who prescribed him more adderall (I thought there was a database to prevent this). Anyway, he took the whole prescription in 3 days. When I talked to him on the phone, I think he had been awake the entire time. He was apparently walking around a park and freaking out because he wasn’t sure if he’d be able to get any more. I would say his name, and he would not respond. I’d say it again and he’d go “yeah?” Then I would ask a question like “where are you man?” and he would just be silent again. This happened like 20 times. He then said something about extortion which made no sense. His mom called 911 but he refused to get any sort of help. Apparently today he is in the hospital, although I haven’t gotten an update. I’m worried he’s going to kill himself one way or another. He was like a brother to me, but this adderall addition has really messed him up.

So my questions are:

What is he going through and feeling after taking so much adderall and being awake for a long period of time? I’ve taken adderall and been up for 48 hours before, but he was just on a different planet with the stuff he was saying.

He claims he has “mastered” the drug and he needs it and has to have it. This is insane right? You can’t master a drug that’s been such a huge problem for you in the past.

Should I tell him I will only speak to him if he is sober and just have that boundary? I also think his mom enables him and I think I need to talk to her about that.

I am a female in my 30s and I have a problem with speed. I started using it as a party drug occasionally. My then boyfriend was a pretty heavy user and it became more and more normal to do a little line once or twice a week. Our relationship was very unhealthy and when I finally found the strength to leave him and go no contact, speed, cigarettes and alcohol kept me going through the day. 

Six months ago I quit all three of them cold turkey because I had to have surgery. I managed to stay away from cigarettes and alcohol for two months, and I was clean off speed for a little longer. I relapsed on speed when my workload (legal field) got too much. On speed I am way more focused and productive. I do my best work on it. That's the thing I hate about it, because the contrast between being on it and coming off of it is so big as far as work productivity goes.

Two months ago I relapsed for two days and then tried to stay off it. But my energy and focus just did not return. Last week I relapsed again and used every working day. I love my professional output on it but I hate that it makes me believe I ""need"" it to function. I never have needed it before 2020. It makes no sense. And I'm not becoming a better person outside of work of course. 

When using speed I smoke continuously and at the end of the day I need alcohol to help with the comedown. So these things go hand in hand. It feels most logical to quit all three again at the same time because they also trigger each other.

I have my supplements ready, I took a few days off of work, I know I can do this again... but I'm doing it alone and I would like to read some encouraging words, maybe some advice or success stories? My addict brain won't let me remember how good and accomplished it felt to be free of substances. I find it hard to truly believe in my own strength since relapsing again. I can recite all the reasons I have for wanting to quit but it doesn't feel like my whole being is behind this idea if that makes sense. It feels like a decision my brain makes, but I'm not fully on board with it. Even though I feel this stuff is going to give me a heart attack sooner or later.

That turned out way longer than anticipated, sorry! Thank you for reading and for those in the same boat, we will get there!",13

One of the things that scares me the most while quitting speed is socializing, I think it's one of the root problems I turned to speed in the first place zu and a huge trigger. 

It made socializing so easy all of a sudden but only for the first months before I was slowly sinking into this shithole I'm currently in. So basically the past 4 years I was hanging out with friends or met new friends I was always high on speed and basically all the friends I have now are people that I met while geeking out and only few of them ever met me sober, not all of them are tweakers one of my best friend only smoked weed and takes psychs every now and then but he understands me but I feel like its all slipping currently.

So today is day two, and I’m so thankful to be rid of the horrible tightness in my chest, but I’m feeling flat-out exhausted. Like I napped for two hours in the afternoon yesterday, slept 5ish hours, woke up ate breakfast and slept two more hours, and I’m still super spacey, and every time I stand up I get lightheaded. I’m feeling like this really set me back, and I’ve gotta work tomorrow. Luckily, I was only using it for about a month, and not every day, but it feels like it was turning into that. 

Does anyone else have experience with using this substance and have withdrawal afterwards? How long did it last?",5

I used the forward slash in the title because I still hold a lot of love for this guy and maybe we have a future together. He’s toxic in a few other ways but I’m just playing things out on the sidelines to see weather or not these traits may be exclusively linked to the drug problem. I say this because I have seen a really great man in him sometimes, he just gets lost I think. 

Unfortunately addiction is all I’ve known in life, lost my dad to heroin and my mum still battles. So I have a fairly good understanding of addiction and I understand that it has to start with actually wanting to recover. Something I’m not sure he’s really committed too atm IMO. 

I’m just wondering if you can impart any advice on steps I could take to try and encourage him as much as possible? 

We got him registered with a charity but it was during the pandemic and was limited to one phone call bi-weekly and in the end he lied to the worker and thus the case was closed down with him making out that he hadn’t had the relapses that he had. 

I personally struggle to understand his addiction because it’s so completely different to my parents. As in, he can and regularly does go long ish periods without using. But then he always falls back into it and his main problem is taking it at work. He has a manual labour Job and unfortunately it’s just the culture of his industry to the best of my knowledge he and “all the boys” are doing it. 

Thank you.",5

I’m looking at a traditional inpatient as well as more 12 step based rehab programs but I almost feel like I’d be lying or “cheating” going through it planning on drinking still. I have talked to the rehabs about that and they all just say they promote total sobriety. Does anyone have any insight?

I asked for help and you guys were there, even though the answer to my question was very obvious. You lifted me up and helped me make the choice I needed to make. I’m beyond grateful. I get to keep my job! And get my life back. Thank you, thank you.

UPDATE 2: Leftover adderall is flushed, the final paper script I had is ripped up and in the trash. I’m now coming down from the weeklong binge I kept going to get through the week. I’ll be taking the weekend to rest, since I’m off on Monday’s. I know it’s not going to be easy or feel good, but I backed myself into a corner so there’s no way to go but up from here.

I’m in a city where I don’t know many people so I’ll be checking back here. 

UPDATE: I did it. I messaged my doctor last night and told her I don’t want to take adderall anymore. I just said I felt like it was doing more harm than good, was having too many side effects, and wanted to let her know I’m going to immediately discontinue taking it. She said okay, and I feel good about the fact that I will never feel comfortable asking her to put me back on it, after I made it clear it was having such a negative impact. Also don’t think she’d say yes if I did ask. Thanks for all the kind words and advice! Now, I just need to make it through the day and flush the rest of my last refill. 

I moved to a new state last year, so it wasn't very difficult to get an adderall prescription here, without them knowing my history. I'm debating messaging my doctor and telling her something along the lines of, ""I have a history of not handling this stuff well but I thought maybe I could. I can't."" I've been trying to stop taking adderall for months, to no avail.

I know I won't go looking for it if I don't have access to my prescription anymore, but I'm nervous to message my doctor and tell her what's going on. I also know that if I don't message her now, I'll convince myself not to do it at all in a few days. I'm looking for a way to force myself into recovery again, if that makes sense. Is that stupid? I'm also worried about my doctor judging me, or being labeled a pill seeker in some sort of state-wide database. I know that sounds like I'm hoping to get back on it in the future, but it's more-so just that I don't want to be labeled and ashamed every time I go to a doctors appointment.

Things have gotten to the point where I feel like I'm not in control anymore and I need to do something drastic to get out of my own way. Thoughts?

I abused Adderall, Vyvanse and even meth (thankfully only once for meth) and I am almost positive it lead to a horrible surge in my anxiety. I f'ed up big time by going on a binge combining Vyvanse with Phenibut that lead to a horrible couple of weeks.

To make a long story short, my psychiatrist found out and I am pretty sure he will be taking me off all of the speed completely, which means I am pretty much done with it because I was only able to get access to it through his scripts (good thing too because it is a really sh%tty and even immoral thing to abuse meds a doctor is prescribing to help you if you think about it.) Been having horrible anxiety ever since then. Granted, being off the Phenibut is causing that mainly, but I know for a fact the stimulant abuse contributed.

Aside from just me though did anybody else end up getting really bad anxiety from their usage? I noticed that especially towards the end, even while using, I started to just get uncomfortable stimulation mixed with anxiety (and in some cases full blown panic attacks.)

I am now 25 and I have done it every year since then on and off. I stopped the longest in 2018 when I got into a relationship with someone in recovery. Stayed off of it for around a year before I did it behind his back in 2019. I’d only ever smoked it up and was off if it entirely just because I no longer had a source or people who did it to hang out with/get it from.

Then the worst thing that has happened leading to this post happened around 1.5 - 2 months ago when an old client of mine from many years before who I knew did meth but never did it with, asked me to come over to catch up. He knew I wasn’t on it but offered it to me anyways. Instant addiction response was “fuck yeah.” The only condition was, I only IV and no shops are open.

And the rest is history. I fell harder in love with this shit drug than I ever was. But it is the worst thing to happen to me. I constantly feel like I’m having a heart attack, I get anxiety, I perform poorly at the job I was ranked #1 in until I picked up the needle. I thought I could always keep my drug addictions under control and usually always have but….I don’t know if I can take the unbearable pain and comedown like I’ve been feeling each time I inject. I’m positive I overdosed two nights ago and my body feels different and is painful all over since. Yet, I still am craving it.

I’ve reached out to a 30 day impatient facility because even though I don’t think I’m strong enough, I’m not ready to die at 25 in the bedroom of my parents house. I worked hard to get to the spot I was in before I went back to meth. I’ve never been 100% from any drug/alcohol for longer than a week at max. 

I hope that I can prove to myself that I have what it takes to take control of my life back. No matter the costs or who I lose in the process.

It was speed (amphetamine). I bought 5g of it and it all started from there. Before that drugs I did were weed, benzos, but in a way I didn't care if they existed or not (now it's different). I did oxys meanwhile, from time to time, when I could afford them. 

Soon after speed I've tried all different rc's like 4mm/4cmc and so it is until now. I basically can't find a way to function without it. I smoke weed everyday or stop sometimes randomly. I can go like 3 days or something without it, but then I'm motivated as fuck to get some. Usually after a break I'd go hard for a few days, which is a weird connection. I tried not to give up at once as it's too hard, but to try to use less and less. In fact it worked for some time, but I'm here now after going hard for last 4 days. 

I realized I've got a problem, which I want to fight. I get those thoughts sometimes if I gave up on stimulants it would make me stronger. Scary thing is my brain seeks the reason to use again. Going out, doing house chores and even when I want to listen to music or smoke a cigarette. Literally music about drugs or movies make me crave it even more.

Now I don't get any rush, euphoria or other pleasurable effects. I just feel numb emotionally and I'm able not to sleep or eat for longer period of time. I wonder if there is anything I could do to get rid of them or at least make myself use only few times a month max. 

When I didn't use I did xanax, 1mg too less, 2 mg is perfect. I feel so sociable and cozy, but I guess trading addiction for addiction isn't the best idea.

Do you have any advice, tips, vitamins, medication that help cravings? How to start recovering and forcing yourself not to use?

Good luck and take care.",5

I love my husband more than anything. I have not relapsed, I’ve been in therapy, I’ve been doing everything right. He is leaving anyway.","It’s been over two months since I threw out my pills. I did it for us and the life we were going to build together.

I never really hit my own rock bottom. Pills were still great for me. The comedown sucked but I was productive on my weekend long benders, I got the things done I wanted to do. Plus it felt really fucking good. At the time, the good still out-weighed the bad. Other than the comedown the only really bad part was the fear of my husband finding out and the stress of lying and hiding it from him. 

And when he did find out and I threw them away I didn’t do it for me, I did it for us, and for him. 

I didn’t even fucking relapse, I didn’t DO anything!!! He fucking lost it because I said I miss them and still think about them all the time. He said he wants separate bank accounts for “when you relapse” because if I fuck up *at all* he is gone. Let me be clear: I never bought drugs ever, all I did was fill my 30$ script each month. I’ve never stolen anything. Im not trying to minimize what I did but I really don’t feel like this is proportionate to the situation. Especially since he used to SNORT THEM WITH ME ALL THE TIME!!! He is just mad about the times I hid it from him. Like what the fuck is this!!??

I don’t fucking understand why he is doing this when I have been doing everything right. I wake up everyday fucking hating everything about myself and the world and I still drink enough water and eat pretty healthy and work full fucking time and got a 4.0 last semester WHILE GOING THROUGH WITHDRAWAL AND WORKING 30 HOURS A WEEK!

I went through absolute hell on earth because he said if I failed a class he would leave me. I only did this for him. 

He wanted separate bank accounts and I had a full blown panic attack. I have done everything right. I am the one who uses YNAB, I don’t have a spending problem. This is, and he admits this, because he needs and exit strategy for “when you relapse”. I had a panic attack and now he doesn’t want to be with me. 8 years of marriage. Done. 

What was the fucking point of all of this. I was happier on my pills. And now I have no one I need to worry about hiding them from. 

I honestly don’t see a reason not to go back on them right now.",65

Here’s a little bit of background:

I’m 17 and was prescribed a daily dose of Adderall XR for the past 5 years. For a couple of those years my dose was at 15mg XR per morning. After that my dose got upped to 20mg XR every morning and a 10mg IR pill in the afternoon as needed. I’m not proud of it but I abused the IR pills and instead of taking them in the afternoon as needed, I would save them up and take 30-60mg IR whenever I felt like I needed it or was just wanting the high. Throughout all of this I would never miss my 20mg XR dosage in the morning, except for a day here in there when, for whatever reason, I decided not to take it. That was very rare, I’d say in the 5 years I’ve been on Adderall, I’ve only really had about 7 days where I didn’t take my morning XR. Throughout the past year, I’ve gotten into other stimulants as well, I would regularly use “stimulant junkie” pre workouts with a bunch of caffeine, DMHA, and other stimulants in them. I’ve since quit all other stimulants except Adderall. As I’ve started to mature, at least very slightly, I’ve noticed that Adderall is a cause of a lot of issues in my life and is definitely doing a lot more harm than good in my life, especially with the way I am taking it. I’ve never been able to quit this year because I’ve had school that I need to function for, and without Adderall, I would not be able to keep up with school at all. So I decided to quit cold Turkey over summer, which starts this coming Friday. 

I know quitting like this is going to be very rough, but due to extreme addictive personality, I would be in almost the same amount of misery if I tapered, but over several months. This, among other reasons, is why I’m quitting cold Turkey. 

I’m curious as to your opinions on the timeline of my withdrawal and the severity of my symptoms. I know there’s no exact way of predicting these things, but your opinions are appreciated.

I also want to know if you guys have any recommendations to make this withdrawal easier/better. Any habits I should try to build, supplements I should take, or any other tips you guys have would be amazing.",4

Long time adderall user- unprescribed for a few years and prescribed for 1.5. I have been slowly becoming ready to quit the past 4 months. I took the initial steps of weening myself down- I am currently taking one 25 mg XR adderall and sometimes a 10 IR on top. 
I just went on a trip for MDW so I didn’t take it for 5 days and told myself to keep that sobriety up and finally bite the bullet to quit. Lo and behold, yesterday morning I took it- I have been kicking myself!!! I know I want to quit, I know it’s going to be hard, I know it will be worth it. I had every intention to flush the rest of the script first thing this morning! Then morning comes and the past hour has been back and forth of my addict brain fighting w my rational brain
“Finish your script and don’t refill”
“Stop smoking weed this month and next month stop adderall”
“Don’t flush it, just hide it in case you need it”
“Is it really even that bad? 25 is nothing you are fine!”

I write this in hopes I read at least one reply that motivates me or makes me officially start my sobriety journey. I’m at the edge of the cliff- I know I have my parachute, I know I will get the hang of it- but I can’t get myself to jump.
I don’t want to walk down this metaphorical cliff disappointed again.",10

2021-06-02 02:17:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/nqf2hu/to_anyone_currently_using_or_in_active_withdrawal/,"To anyone currently using or in active withdrawal, I promise you that quitting will be worth it","As of today, it has been 52 days since I last used meth. I was using almost every day for a little over a year. I have a history of major depression and agoraphobia, and I was an alcoholic for several years as a result. I’m 24 years old.

When I first started using crystal, and probably for the first 6 months, I felt great. My thoughts were organized, that depression fog I’d been living under had lifted. I could socialize and process information quicker. I could get out of bed in the morning with a hit.

I thought I was an exception. I never “looked” like meth addiction. No one in my life besides my fiancé knew about it, and he was using with me. We dosed “responsibly”, we brushed our teeth, we took vitamins, we cooked meals. I worked on my art, we decorated our apartment. We were “normal.” We deluded ourselves into believing that we were just medicating ourselves according, because we were both so much more functional this way. 

If there’s any wisdom I can impart to anyone who’s in the position I was once in, it’s that I promise you are not an exception. Stims will tear through your neurotransmitters and when it has nothing left to chew up it’ll come for your personality and identity next. What goes up must come down. It’s not a matter of “if”, but “when.”

So now it has been 52 days since I stopped speeding, and the horrors I’ve read about how long it takes to feel “normal” again are what made me reluctant to stop to begin with, so I have 2 things I’d like to say about withdrawal and recovery:

1. “Feeling normal again”— try to eliminate this phrase from your mind when thinking about recovery. Because what does this really mean? How “normal” were you feeling when you smoked meth for the first time? There is something that lead you to addiction, and the “normal” that you’re hoping to get back to is likely more pleasant in your memories than it ever was in reality. 

Don’t waste time searching for “normal.” You will not be better or worse. Distance yourself from this language. You will grow and change just like everyone else. Work on yourself: spend time with trees, jog, read, bake, crochet, ride your bike,— do whatever it is that works for YOU. One small thing each day, if possible, that makes you feel good. If you can't? Try again tomorrow. Distractions are your friend, but I know sometimes the despair must be felt.

2. Getting clean will be worth it. It won’t always feel worth it, but it is always worth it. When you have that first moment of happiness and pride after quitting, write it down. No matter how short-lived or seemingly insignificant. The pain will come back, but you can remind yourself that so will the joy. Just as the human experience has always been. 

52 days. That’s not long. It didn’t feel like long. But I have good days already. I’ve had days already where stimulants haven’t even crossed my mind. I promise you can do this. I’m so proud of you.

2021-06-01 04:34:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/npp896/underwhelming_lessons_from_one_year_sober/,Underwhelming Lessons from One Year Sober,"I knew I had done some damage this time last year when, after bingeing Vyvanse and marijuana for a solid week after my cat died, dark blotches clouded my vision and my mind felt like it went into Energy-Saver mode: for several days my thoughts seemed to spark in different parts of my brain like fireflies in a field at night. About a week after the incident I was already beginning to feel somewhat better, though it was clear to me something was still off. I knew I had to stop the Vyvanse at least temporarily—mine was prescribed not for ADHD but for chronic fatigue following mononucleosis—but I thought whatever damage I had done would heal relatively quickly and that I could restart the medicine—without which the fatigue is staggering—after a few months.

What little I knew! The apparent recovery I experienced a week after my overdose and lasting for about a month in all seems to have been what is called the “pink cloud,” a temporary bubble of well-being and optimism before the post-acute withdrawals kick in. What’s difficult about my case is that I felt better during the pink cloud than I do today after a year of sobriety. I think I am in somewhat uncharted medical territory: on the one hand, my symptoms are worse than they were before the overdose, so that certainly played a part in how I feel now, but on the other hand, people who abuse harder drugs at greater doses and for longer periods of time seem to recover faster than I have so far. My working theory is that the post-viral syndrome (which seems to be partly neurological) and the overdose (which definitely pissed off my brain) inflicted damage synergistically so that what I’m experiencing now is worse than the sum of the symptoms of each of those events. In short, my brain is ultra fucked up.

Lately I’ve been treading in a shallow pool of relative emotional stability, which has afforded me the ability to have a good laugh at my early-sobriety self. What visions I had of where I’d be by now! I was positively intoxicated by the idea of sobriety. I’d become my best self, better than any version of myself before. I’d work out, get barrel-keg arms and diamond-hard abs, and run—no, *sprint*—miles every day. And even though my brain was fried, I’d read and study and learn languages and play piano: hell, I’d publish essays about recovery and discover some new groundbreaking treatment myself. And all those interpersonal problems that so many of us addicts have? Those would be a thing of the past, and I’d be more popular than ever. Finally, I believed, some true, complete version of myself would emerge from its infinity of cocoons, and everyone would recognize and love the real me. Everyone I ever felt neglected or misjudged or wronged by would spontaneously call me up and say, “Hey, you know what, Billy? I did you dirty, and I’m sorry, and what’s more, I think you’re really awesome. Cheers to you, dude.” Some orchestral music would play, the credits would roll, and I would be fully recovered at long last.

What a naïve child! Dear Billy-from-June-2020, son, you’re in for some ugly shit. At least once a week for at least the next year, you’re going to feel like you’re positively dying, like your brain is just shutting down, going dark. Instead of getting fit you will get fat, or at least fatter than you’ve ever been. In the next year you’ll read less than you ever have in your entire adult life. You’ll neglect responsibilities, you’ll neglect friends. You will unlearn the ability to feel joy or interest. You’ll spend entire weeks weighing the pros and ~~cons~~ additional pros of suicide. Music will become a succession of unwelcome sounds; the touch of your lover will be like cold lifeless sandpaper. Some days even the act of imagining will be too strenuous. All the parts of yourself you consider the most human will be reduced to a minimum.

The worst of all that horse-shit is, I think, over, but I have fewer expectations now than I used to about my long-term prospects for recovery. In another year I may feel slightly better or significantly better; neither will surprise me. It’s tempting of course to try to draw some lesson from what happened, to convince myself that what I’ve suffered was in some way ennobling.

If I learned anything it is this: if you lose your health, your friends, your future, your happiness, your self-respect, your hope—in short, if you lose all those aggregates of living except life itself—then you’re left with the rare opportunity to see who you are at your core. When you lose everything you are left with nothing but yourself and so unlike the vast majority of blessedly undamaged people you will have a solid answer to the question “Who am I?”.

I’m still not sure having that knowledge is worth sitting through the lesson though.",38
