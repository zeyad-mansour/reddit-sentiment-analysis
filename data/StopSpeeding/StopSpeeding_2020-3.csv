I‚Äôve been reading Russell Brand‚Äôs book, ‚ÄúRecovery from our Addictions‚Äù. He going through each of the 12 steps along with exercises to complete for each. However, I‚Äôm reading the book alone and therefore working through the steps alone. He highly recommends to do them, at least from step 4 and onward, with an admin or sponsor of some sort. 
I have two questions for anyone willing to weigh in...
1.) How important is it to begin this process in complete abstinence? The line between use and recovery is so fine... Does the line even exist? Or do we one day realize the why‚Äôs and feel empowered enough to just stop? Needless to say, I‚Äôm still using. I definitely I do not want to do myself more harm by using while going through the steps. 
2.) How do I find a sponsor? Other than going to AA or NA...

For awhile, I drank it away. Always the life of the party on the outside. 

For awhile, I used opiates, until I couldn't get them anymore. I detoxed without telling anyone.

Raised a kid, worked, graduated college, got a decent career. Involved in the community, lots of friends. Got married late in life, more because I was ready than he was the right guy. 

Managed to have cushy enough jobs with flex schedules and PTO to account for the days, sometimes weeks I couldn't get out of bed. 

Still running from it, but it started to nip at my heels.

Things got bad, then things got worse. I tried to kill myself.

I lived. No one helped me. 

I had been around hard drugs but never had an interest. I had friends who used off and on, but I was the helper. I wasn't a participant.

My husband and I did coke. It felt good and we actually talked. I felt less lonely.

A friend of his offered us meth one night. I took the pipe and learned how to hit it. Nothing that awesome really. Why had I been so scared? 

But I went back over and did more. 

I went back over without my husband and did more.

He gave me some and I bought a pipe. He told me where to go to buy one. 

I smoked in the closet while my husband sat downstairs. 

I slowly stopped trying. It was minuscule slips as it happened, but I see it all now. 

Still, it was only maybe once a month. I read everything on harm reduction. I wasn't that worried.

I went to my doctor and asked for Adderall. It took a few visits but she gave it to me. 

I got up every single day for work. I got so much done. I didn't sleep 10 hours a day. I didn't deal with crushing depression anymore. I wrote and read and lost all my drinking and depression weight. I didn't care so much for drinking anymore either. 

I still smoked meth when I felt like it, until I started to use more of my Adderall than prescribed. I panicked, I couldn't back slide into that depression again. I couldn't go back. 

So I bought some. Just to get me through till my next prescription. I told myself I'd only use it orally. 

I found myself hollowing out a light bulb in my brand new beautiful house we had just purchased. Just to smoke this one time. 

I tried to quit. 

But I needed to catch everything up, to fix everything. I'd quit later. 

I crushed up my Adderall and snorted it. Just to get things done this one time. 

I bought meth on work trips to take advantage of the freedom of a hotel room to myself. Just to indulge once, twice. 

Everything stared to crack, but I wasn't depressed so it was fine. Plus, I had my pills and I could catch everything up I needed to in one productive day. I had the magic pill. 

I stopped showing up to anything, all my community involvement and activities went to they wayside. 

I told myself I'd catch back up later. 

My husband kept buying coke. I did it with him for awhile and lost interest. 

I tried, but not really to work on my marriage. It was headed for disaster but we were both so dysfunctional, I thought we still kind of had each other.

I tried to quit again. 

I knew I had still had this under control, I just needed to catch up. I'd quit for real once I was caught up. 

We fell behind on everything. We were in financial ruin. I blamed him.

He found someone to have an affair with. I didn't even notice. 

I became so anxiety ridden from the stimulants I could barely function. The bills were too much to handle. I put them off. I became so socially anxious I didn't really go anywhere anymore. My husband started the typical gaslighting shit, telling me people were saying this and that about me, to cover his cheating, I sat alone paranoid most of the time. 

I lost friends. 

I tried to quit again. 

But if I just had a few weeks to catch up, everything would be fine again. I could quit later. 

I started to have a harder and harder time regulating my emotions. Anger came out of nowhere. I found out about the affair and it exploded. It was so, so ugly. I filed for divorce. He had me arrested for harassment. His family dropped me like I never existed at all. 

I was suddenly alone. Totally alone with no reason to hide anything anymore. 

I used my 30 day prescription in a week. 

Then I bought meth. 

I haven't been sober since. 

The depression finds its way in anyway now. 

I've managed to keep my job, barely. Because of the virus I work completely from home now and spend every day and every night in total solitude. In the house that once contained my dreams of the future, but now is a prison of what could have been. 

I reach out to people but it's been so long. No one has the capacity to fill this gaping hole of all that I am missing anyway. I am so, so needy and I am never fun anymore. Life has simply moved on without me. 

I text my husband out of habit, only to be verbally abused. 

I no longer have the attention span for TV or movies. The house is dead silent. 

The state is on stay at home orders, there is an end date but I'm scared it's going to be a lot longer and the lack of social connection or any kind of schedule terrifies me. 

I'm scared I'm going to go crazy here alone with the drugs and no need to keep a facade. 

I'm scared to quit the drugs here alone because the depression will be so, so bad and I am completely  isolated, which will just compound the depression. It's terrifying to even think about. 

I'm scared I'll run out of drugs anyway and have nothing to fall back on. 

I am in a very deep hole and I can't see it ending well. 

Unless I can just get caught up. Everything might be fine again. 

I've still totally got this, right?",17

Though my experience from my two day binge two days ago and today, I'm not sure if I see any reason to continue either.

I imagine losing the euphoria is common for most people, I know I did. That electric, tingly feeling and goosebumps all over + great mood. It faded slowly until I mostly only felt the effects on concentration and motivation. It also made stuff a lot more fun of course. I've been using for 4 years, though my abuse didn't start until a year ago.

Anyway, on my last binge and today when I've taken it: I barely feel anything. For context, I've taken 300mg just the past 2 hours and I only feel mildly stimulated. No gurning, no motivation and no desire to do anything in particular. Usually when it hits, I end up doing whatever just because I have so much energy. Now I just feel tired and unfocused.

Is this normal? I know that MDMA for example stops working for most people, but I didn't think amphetamines would stop working after using it for a while?

Either way, I don't see any point in continuing to use if it flat out doesn't work anymore.",34

Now that a couple days have past I‚Äôve been craving that dopamine spike. With the Coronavirus pandemic around I find myself alone more than I‚Äôd like.

1. you drove everyone away when you used. all of your friends who were around to see you deteriorate decided that they didn‚Äôt want to be a part of it anymore, and since you refused their help so many times, they bailed. you can‚Äôt blame them - it‚Äôs not up to them to fix you. everyone could see how miserable you were except for yourself bc you were so blinded by meth.

2. every time you shot up, you became someone else. in reality, you only feel comfortable having sex with someone you have feelings for, and you don‚Äôt shame anyone else with different opinions but when it comes to you personally, one night stands/booty calls/etc. aren‚Äôt really your thing. but whenever you shot up, for the first hour or two, it made you so hypersexual and you were so gullible and easy to manipulate. the guys around you only wanted sex and you were an easy lay for them after shooting up. you are worth something more than whatever that was. you don‚Äôt deserve to be used and treated like shit.

3. after that crazy rush from shooting up would fade, you became annoying and unlikeable. you were SO paranoid and anxious. everyone was always asking your bf if you were okay because you looked like you were having a panic attack. in reality you were sitting there thinking about how people in the room probably didn‚Äôt like you, how they probably thought you were ugly, how they probably thought you weren‚Äôt funny. then after a while, you‚Äôd realize how weird you were being, so you‚Äôd start getting paranoid ABOUT being paranoid. and your eyes, dude. you have big eyes as it is. but your eyes would get even bigger somehow and you‚Äôd look all bugged out and like a deer caught in headlights. not cute. not cool, man.

4. you weren‚Äôt funny or likeable or kind or patient, like you normally are. normally, you‚Äôre a pretty chill & cool person to hang with! but whenever you were using, you were awkward, paranoid, anxious, antisocial, nervous, irritable, agitated, etc. you‚Äôre usually so loving and caring, but when you were using, you didn‚Äôt give a fuck about anyone except for yourself. you tried to lie and say you were still that same loving girl from back when you had never used, but now you know that was a lie. you WEREN‚ÄôT that same person. you weren‚Äôt you. you were mean & cold-hearted. you only cared about yourself and how you felt. and you only cared about meth.

5. when you and your bf were still using, you guys fought ALL. THE. TIME. EVERY. FUCKING. DAY. you guys did & said the most irrational crazy shit that you would NEVER in a million years say nowadays. you guys hated each other. he was a neglectful insensitive asshole, and you were a needy paranoid hypersensitive crybaby. you guys literally broke up for a few days. the only reason you guys are still together is because you both agreed- NO MORE DRUGS. if you use again, he will dump you. that‚Äôs the rule you guys made and you need to follow it through because it‚Äôs for your own benefit.

6. you almost killed yourself because you were so miserable with addiction, and because you couldn‚Äôt see yourself getting clean. now you‚Äôre 90 days sober, isn‚Äôt that proof enough that you **can** do it? you deserve to be alive.

7. it didn‚Äôt make you more productive - it made you more messy, in fact. you literally skipped every single class, every single day. now you‚Äôre taking a gap semester and you have to go back and finish your degree, but you‚Äôre going to do it without drugs. dude, you were so smart before you started using - involved in local politics, a member of so many extracurricular activities, dean‚Äôs list two years in a row, and you had a job on campus you loved. now you have NONE of that. it‚Äôs all because of meth. if you use again, there‚Äôs no chance in hell you will ever be that successful again. no chance at all. if you stay clean, there‚Äôs hope. you did it once before, you‚Äôll do it again.

8. you were so high and barred out one night that you got a branding. you literally have a little brand tattoo of an orca on your wrist now. and you put it on your story for everyone to see. AND you accidentally posted a photo of your bf doing a line off your tits on your story and 9 ppl saw it before you deleted it. like, dude that‚Äôs proof right there. THAT‚ÄôS HOW INSANE YOU WERE. no wonder people thought you were crazy. do you want to be that weirdo again? 

9. you never ate or slept. you & your bf were exhausted all the time. you‚Äôd stay up for days at a time which caused a lot of the fights you got into. towards the end there, you weighed 84 pounds. dude, you‚Äôre 5‚Äô3‚Äù. that‚Äôs not normal. you looked like skin & bones, you did not look healthy. ever since you got clean, you‚Äôve put on at least 10 pounds and people have commented on how healthy & beautiful you look now, some have even said you have a natural glow. that‚Äôs sobriety, baybee. you know what that‚Äôs not? meth. 

i hope this list helped someone who needed it, it sure did help me.",15

So I was in a dedicated relationship for 5 years.  About 6 weeks ago, my girlfriend told me that she smoked a bowl of meth with some dude who she met online. Major red flag. Shes on felony probation and has done relatively well over the past 2 years (a few slips) and has less than a year left.  I kind of lost my shit but after my initial reaction I just tried to be supportive and come from a place of love and understanding.  Shes a very complex person and struggles with depression.  She basically asked me to find her some meth.  She started telling me daily that she needed it to get through what she was going through and was sincerely starting to contemplate suicide.  I gave in. I hit up my connect who has clean quality stuff.  I knew that if she scored it locally here in the north bay... there was a chance it would be laced with fentanyl.  I felt better scoring her the real deal.  I know, I made a mistake.  Theres no real justification for this. Anyways that was the start of a bender for her and she was able to source more locally and basically ran away to another county with $40 to her name and I decided that this was too much for my mental health and recovery and have cut contact with her.


A couple of days later I visit my younger brother.  He had over 2 years sober,  worked in treatment as a driver.  As far as I knew, he was sober. I look in his room and spot beer cans. I then smell weed and see bongs.  I then open up his bathroom door and see about 10 needles and blood on the sink.


Fuck. I just came here to vent.  I'm so fucking upset but I'm carrying myself through this situation well but it's really difficult not having in person meetings and support available. I have a therapy appointment Wednesday but I'm just really sad. I dont want to relapse.

Also, my closest friend in recovery (we got sober two days apart) has been snorting speed at my SLE and is using fake pee on piss tests. Hes been relatively lowkey and I'm the only person who knows about this because he told me and I keep trying to help him get sober.  Right now hes just sleeping a lot coming off of it.


But yeah this has been a really hard week.  I'm also the survivor of a parental suicide and another parent who passed two years later after my fathers suicide.


I know this is a lot but yeah just needed to post. Thanks for reading",34

But it was right there and autopilot got the best of me. It's so much easier to relapse than to stop yourself. As soon as I started smoking I knew I'd fucked myself up. There goes 10 days, there goes the start of the recovery. Back to square one. 

Every time I fool myself into thinking I have some self control but I don't. I have turned it down once, ever. Back before I was neck deep in this mess. Only because I'd overdosed with it and my MAOI meds. 

I went to hospital 10 days ago because I overdosed again, once again while on MAOIs. A year and a bit later like the worst kind of prophetic anniversary. It was the scariest thing I'd ever been through, I still have traumatic flashbacks about it almost daily. But that wasn't enough to stop me when it was right there. Meth doesn't give a fuck how it hurts you, it only wants to take control. 

After the overdose I told myself never again, never going back. I desperately wanted that to be true. I don't want to tell my best mate I fucked up again. I don't want them to worry about a call in the middle of the night saying I've overdosed. 

I'd never gone to hospital before meth, but since this started it's been 6 times in a year. Two meth related, the other ones all because of drugs. I don't know how long it takes to learn that none of this is good for me. 

I don't want to go back, never again. I hope this time it's for real.",8

Im also early on in this journey. I was a heroin addict, addicted to the needle. I love the needle but that's a whole other post. Suboxone helped me live a basically normal life again alongside 12 steps. *then* my best friend who is a gay meth dealer broke me out a line. I was legit running a marathon two weeks later. See, I'm also in the LGBTQ community in a small fucking town. Same said best friend was the one who introduced me to heroin 9 years back. We both kicked that. Then he slowly entered into the meth scene. Rationalizing. I had a fun night that turned into me leaving with a tiny zip of shards to enjoy at my serving shifts. I then after day 1 was like fuck that. I'm training, I've come to far....)

4 months later (January 2019)
I am sniffing every day. I am still maintaining my job because I'm taking a shit ton of benzos and my subs. I start getting sloppy.
One night at said friends, who was now moving about an ounce a day of high quality shit, after a shitty shift at work. Give me a pin damnit.
He fake argued but secretly wanted this to happen because I had a commodity that he didn't a license and a car. 
Cue dragons breath. Cue this was ALL that could ever be felt pleasure at once. Flushed. Dilated. Nauseaus. Inhaling and exhaling. White light.
...and that was the worst decision of my life.

Next scene: 5 months of crippling addiction. I did a speedball and was on a ventilator in ICU for 3 days. Did inpatient right after that (obvious right choice) got out after my 21 days and shot up that night. I was traumatized from that severe od or heart attack, not sure,  but ice was the only thing that mattered. My families broken, my girlfriend broke up with me heartbroken and in a solid recovery program, I disappeared.  

I soon  got too paranoid to keep being the driver on all these deals, and it started being me taking all the risks in my car while he made money. But I got free shit, cigs, and an apartment....

I wound up going to the psych hospital to get out of psychosis 3 times, 2 more rehabs, and a suicide attempt crash into a sign that turned into a serious dui. 

I lost my mind. And wound up alone. With horrifying delusions. I never slept. I didnt want the come down. It was super foolish. But I stopped taking the appropriate measures to tweak somewhat functionally. I was doing gram shots at a time, the amount heavy users of years were doing. Chasing that fucking dragon and all I got was fucking burned. From the inside out..


I entered long term, got on psych meds, and have 136 days. Its definitely hard when my brain still craves that dopamine surge but I will be damned to use meth again. I am running again, restoring personal relationships that I burned to the ground using, taking care of my rescue dog, living life,  going back to college in the fall, and hopefully getting my girlfriend back. thank you God.

And my friend? He got busted while I was away and is in jail. I do hope he changes, but I think he is in for good.


DON'T GIVE UP! I attend a digital AA meeting via zoom daily. I jam to music I loved before meth.

2020-03-20 13:46:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/flza8x/week_1_down/,Week 1 down.,"I posted here a couple weeks ago - have been addicted to stims, mostly amphetamines, for 8 years now. Started with Rx Dexedrine, had a script-happy doctor who massively overprescribed. Coke became a concurrent problem and after 3 years, I quit all stims. Cold turkey, no rehab, nothing. It was awful, but I did it. 

Then I went back to college 6 months later. And I thought, well, one couldn't hurt - I need a boost. LOL, yeah right. So stupid of me. I don't think I've been sober more than 1 day in 4 years between street amphs, meth, and of course, the pills. 

It's funny how everything they did for you at first completely inverts as addiction progresses - my memory is totally shot, I can't focus, I don't want to talk to anyone, I'm constantly anxious or manic or depressed or often all 3 at once. I had to drop out of university last quarter because I couldn't even motivate myself to do the work. That was the final straw. I'm going to get better, I'm going to go back, I'm GOING to finish my degree. 

My partner is off for the next few weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so I asked him to keep an eye on me while I detoxed starting last Friday. God. It's so much worse than the first time. I've been sleeping \~20 hours a day and maybe get out of bed for an hour or two - couldn't take care of myself alone. It's so embarrassing. My partner uses stims maybe 3 times a year, and he knew I was a daily user, but I don't think he understood the true extent of my addiction. 

Really, I've been high since the day we met 4 years ago - what if he doesn't like the real me? I don't even remember the real me, except that I hated her. Maybe that part of me is gone, and I'll find a new way to be. Maybe it doesn't matter. 

**The point is, I'm 1 week sober!** And I'm trying really hard to be excited about it but thinking positively is hard when thinking at all is hard.

Sorry I rambled so much. I just needed to vent a little. Could keep going but I need to rest again. Hoping this gets easier soon, even just a tiny bit. <3",41

Now I'm in the same cycle but my clean time is 1-2 months and I can't break it. (My fam doesn't know).

I've gotten clean before for 8 months but I had to go to a long term inpatient and then do outpatient and sober housing. 

Which I loved and would actually want to do again, but I have 2 problems:

-I cannot quit my job to go to rehab. This is the best job I've ever had and I already have really terrible work history. I finally make enough to support myself and I never could before. I'd rather improve it and stay longer than make my work history worse by quitting again after only a few weeks of work. The only acceptable alternative is getting laid off due to corona. My unemployment would be enough to live off of and I could justify going back to rehab. 

-My mom will make my life hell. She begged with me to move back in with her after I relapsed. She told me if I relapsed again she was done. I got scared and agreed. But the whole reason I moved out in the first place is because she used to treat me like shit and I couldn't stay sober. She's better now but my mental heath is terrible when I live with her. She's still really unhealthy and doesnt ""allow"" me to have friends or go out for anything but work. I'm twenty.  

When I explain why I want to leave (crazy rules, negative atmosphere, impeding life goals) She  tells me that these are excuses and the only reason I want to leave is because I want to do drugs. If I move out she says she will use that as proof of my drug use and will disown me for good this time. 

I want to figure out a good solution. I was trying to analyze why I relapsed when I realized I didn't have anything to stay sober for anymore. I used remind myself I could get a dog, or go to college when I got clean but everything I was looking forward to isn't an option living with my mom. 

My family and living situation makes me unhappy rn but I know I'd be devastated if I moved out and completely lost them. Reddit help.",20

Made myself coffee/chewed some Nicorette and take a short walk, about 25 minutes. This is hard. Have done this so many times. I‚Äôve done WD‚Äôs with almost every category of drug you could think of so I‚Äôm just grateful I‚Äôm not having tremors, not sleeping for days, and going into psychosis- seriously it could be way worse. I am totally between a rock and a hard place with the uppers though. I got narcolepsy four years ago, which is a debilitating and permanent neurological disease that prevents you from getting the stages of deep sleep you need to make you not feel like a zombie, not fall asleep uncontrollably, and have any cognitive function. It also causes fun stuff like terrible nightmares and being so sleep deprived that you hallucinate...good times. I haven‚Äôt been able to drive, work, or have any kind of productive and satisfying life since. Getting clean (from alcohol) was a breeze before I developed this awful disease. I feel like I always go back to medications because I know I won‚Äôt have energy to live a fulfilling life and ever feel good and healthy in my body even when I‚Äôm sober. I only had issue with alcohol (and some recreational cocaine and Adderall- pretty much under control) years ago and did the AA thing (All the steps and frequent meetings, met with a sponsor weekly) and loved how healthy and happy I felt. Fast forward to getting narcolepsy and being RX‚Äôd a litany of addictive medications (they‚Äôre all addictive or don‚Äôt work or have terrible side effects like seizures for example). I can‚Äôt take medications for this. It just never works out. The ones that actually do help- like Adderall I abuse. And even if I don‚Äôt abuse the Adderall, just taking it somehow fucks up my addict brain. I get into addictive behaviors and am just not myself. I just want to feel like ME. And I feel like that‚Äôs impossible drugs or not. I dunno. Imagine the fatigue of early stim WD multiplied by about ten and that‚Äôs what I deal with everyday. When the WD‚Äôs die down, I still have the fatigue and want to sleep my life away, so I get into feeling like ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äù. At meetings I truly can‚Äôt relate to people. Having chronic illness and being an addict at the same time is truly a whole different ballgame. I need a miracle. The medications are bringing my relationship down and me down, but without them so is the narcolepsy. At this point I‚Äôm looking into alternative healing (Reiki, Pranic Healing, Yoga, meditation) and finding some Chronic Pain/Illness Anonymous groups in addition to other 12 Step Groups. This was way long so if you read this I appreciate it. Anyone else have physical issues and/or disabilities who can relate? 

TLDR: Have severe chronic illness and feel like shit even off of the addictive drugs I am prescribed to treat it, but can‚Äôt not abuse my medications due to being an addict/self-medicating.  Anyone relate?",5

By now it feels like another lifetime, I've come a long way since then. Looking back on my addiction, it's unfathomable to me that I was in that place, and I've come so far since then in life. Anyhow....

Drinking heavy amounts of alcohol nowadays, which I do once a month gives me some euphoria but compared to my pre-meth use, it pales in comparison to how it used to make me feel. Before I ever touched meth or adderal, alcohol made me feel absolutely amazing. It felt much more rewarding and overall better/soothing. Since meth, it just feels meh and doesn't hit the spot, at all. I feel drink and uncoordinated, but I don't feel happy or euphoric, at all no matter how much I drink. It doesn't get ""all the cylinders firing"" so to speak.

Very seldomly (once every 3 months) I decide to use marijuana and when I do it makes me paranoid, **EXTREMELY anxious**, depressed and apathetic. **Before** I used meth it made me happy, curious and euphoric all on it's own. I decided to stop using weed altogether because I don't like how it makes me feel. In a way, getting high on weed post-meth addiction made me feel the same way meth psychosis made me feel. **Extremely uncomfortable and not good, at all! It feels like hell!**

Once I started my meth addiction 1.5 years ago , I quit weed because weed + meth together caused insanely bad psychosis, and terrible symptoms I could not live with. I quit weed for meth, then gave up meth for long term, grueling sobriety because meth had  destroyed everything I had (finances, health, sanity) and was literally killing me. I had no moderation or control over the drug.

***Does using meth and heavy RX stimulants forever change all other substances?***

Does the damage from meth abuse ever truly recover on it's own? ***Am I still in recovery 400 days off stimulants?***

**Or is meth really forever?**",37

Corona shit happened so the job I got as a receptionist/barrista at a hotel got put on pause. Didn‚Äôt have the same need to be responsible, what was I working for? Thoughts and comments surfaced and after a few days me and the gf agreed I would go out to buy.

Now I can sadly say, 82 days doesn‚Äôt mean a return back to the glory days. I got about an hour of euphoria, after which even my pupils shrank. I became catatonic and extremely passive. I would respond only to agree if I even responded at all. Voices crept in with a swift haze. Okay so I‚Äôll do some more? Did some more and more after that. Mixed with alcohol and neurontin. By the end of the night I was lying in extreme guilt because I couldn‚Äôt respond at all, every response or comment was forced through a million filters and nothing that came out was 100% accurate to what I meant. Neighbors next door commented when I walked out for a smoke (through the door) neighbors behind the wall talked about us constantly. When I left the room for a second gf was on the phone, I could hear the buttons tapping when she was in the bathroom. I didn‚Äôt trust her. 

Eventually I took 2mg risperdal and 25mg seroquel. To which everything started becoming visual as well. Cleaning ladies in suits in empty offices. Spies in suits and recorders on the top floor. One person having a stretch out in the courtyard (no one there) turned into 2 people fucking. The walls and ceiling morphed and portrayed messages to me, the neighbors gave me hints and I couldn‚Äôt grasp a single thread to respond to my partner. 

So now, sadly I‚Äôve only slept 30 minutes, I feel great, due to the meds mostly but I took a small bomb before I headed out the door. When I quit I was so drained of happy chemicals I was just a shell, almost 3 months later and it wasn‚Äôt even close to restored. Was really looking forward to day 90 for a while there, fuck

Edit: (Schizophrenia) and I don‚Äôt usually use meds.",5

It make some times now that I stopped amph (barely 2 years) and even now its hard to not relapse when someone offer me to take some.

Well a bit of background : 

Just moved to work in philipinne (swiss guy here) for 2 months as an intern. I usually somke weed every day or every oder day and it really help me to sleep. 

So here it's so hot even at night that I sleep like one night on 2 and it begun to piss me off like hell. So I was like why not getting a little bit of weed just to go to sleep when it's really hard. At that point nothing too crazy right ?

Well one evening I met a guy that tell me he can have me some ""good"" weed. I knew that I'll dont get some really good shit but anyway its just to go to sleep.

He tell me like we have to go to my uncle house to get some. So I just take enough money to buy a few grams and not any card or anything really important that can be stolen.

Went there

Arrived to a slum, and I was like ok nothing to worry about, most people live in those there. 

So went to his brother house. When we enter I already see that they have everything in a litlle box to smoke ice. I was like ""ok hope I'm wrong and that's not what I think"". 

So give half of the money to his brother to go searched the thing and while we wait they take out a little bag of white dust. I'm like fuck no, I already can feel my hearthbeating go high as hell...

They begin to make some hot rails, and tell me ""want some"".

1000 emotions pass by my mind before with some extreme effort, I respond ""no thanks"". In that small area I can already smell it, feel it. 

Geez, saying no was soo hard, didnt thought that even 2 years after stopping it, it would still be that hard.

Oh abd for the weed, like I supposed it was some shitty weed but idc got it and leaved the house as fast as possible.

P.S: just had to write this somewhere..",10

Send good energy please.,"The journey from First time user to daily user can be a quick one. My name is [redacted] im 23 years old and I've been addicted to meth amphetamine since I was 15 years old. It has had a prevalent role in my life from being a social tool; a tool for work; an escape, an experiment, a family tradition or just simply out of boredom.
Maybe reading the Crank series by Ellen Hopkins while I was in alternative school was enough first hand perspective to be curious; what's all the fuss over these drugs considered to be to heavy for public public lifestyle but still find their place in some peoples lives... well I'll tell you when my brother offered me that thin white line, I thought addiction was just an idea; nothing that I couldn't talk myself out of, afterall I read the books? What could it do to me that I wasnt prepared for? Turns out alot..
It started with self harm; moving away from my connections to the drug the first time was inevitable; my family has never lived in one place very long; not for any particular reason, although my mother claims it's because our ancestors were a nomadic people; maybe that's why I feel like I cant stop moving. Deep Slashes to my wrist that have left visibly depressing scars reminding me of a simpler time; dealing with the same issues I am now.
Then it came into my life again; this time at work, the one place I couldn't afford to avoid. Having it in the work place made me feel incredibly confident; I was ahead of the curve because I had this thing the others didnt; it made work mindless; it made interactions less personal and it was entertaining too. Getting away from it this time was easy because it was the first time I hit rock bottom; I had no food, no money, I was dealing drugs in an apartment that was compleatly empty from wall to wall; the electricity was cut off and I was pushing myself beyond my body's physical capacity for lack of sleep, food and hydration. Vomiting stomach acid; nausea, skin breakouts that never healed but festered worse every night of continued use, and chronic fatigue paired with an unsustainable figure that became my first true look at the effects it has on my body. 
I became disgusted with my appearance, I moved away from that poor excuse for an apartment but without a second thought after finding new residence I found another connection; at this time i felt fine; it was a place I felt safe from persecution, but as it turned out that was what I needed the most to find my way away from it; a heartfelt talk with a man I respected alot gave me the courage to confess I had been taking it too far but couldn't bring myself to stop; I threw away everything that was related to meth for the first time; including the friends i had. I moved again; this time of my own free will in an attempt to get away from it. I moved back in with my mom; we stayed in a trailer in a small secluded lot in port lavaca; a small secluded town on the gulf coast of Texas, I went through withdrawls the first time and felt my immune system punishing me for weeks, I didnt have weed, I hardly had cigarettes, but I had my mother who made me meals everyday rich in nutrients ideal for recovery. I had some idea that she may have been using; rumors among siblings led me to believe she was, but I never addressed it. I came to get sober and that was my intention; until one day it wasnt... fast forward to san Antonio, my grandma inherited a house from my late grandfather who I never really new for what I understand to be good reason. We stayed in the extra rooms; we cooked meals as a family; we went on long drives listening to classic rock and sometimes I'd be able to find a little weed through solicitation, or a family member passing through, but most nights it was just cold tile floors, a few blankets and my little siblings cuddling next to me while we watch a movie. Weeks pass; my drug issue seemed to be ancient history and I was learning more about myself than I ever had before reading books or opening up to people. Being completely sober made alot of things easier, it stabilized my mood, gave me drive and I had so much free time I was able to think alot about what I wanted for myself after leaving this place. Well I cant quite say when it happened but one day I was sober and the next my mother was passing me the pipe. It escalated quickly after that; we enabled eachother and bad stuff got worse; but we were in it as a family and one day my mom said that it were done; and we dug ourselves out of it as a family. Sobriety came back and finally I found a way out of that tiny trailer ( we only stayed with my grandma for a few weeks at a time; when we weren't there we were couch surfing friends of the family or in the trailer. My way out was a girl; she was exactly the type of girl I thought I wanted. We had a great run and are friends to this day; but while working at my first restaurant as a career line cook; I noticed one of the servers was speeding around daily. It didnt take more than a few months before I asked about it; and before I knew it i was using again. This crumbled my relationship with my coworkers and my partner. Back to square one; I moved onto my brothers couch, by this time I had recovered physically but was still doing mental gymnastics trying to stay away from it. Tons of adderall became a temporary issue, then substituting substances; eventually moving off his couch I managed to get my own place with a recovered addict who was beautiful, had a sweet daughter and a great personality, but one day I found she had been cheating on me and I kicked her out. When she left i was so resentful for being used when we shared so much happiness; I used again as a crutch. But not before It presented itself to me; I let an old friend from highschool crash on my couch with his girlfriend; my only rule? No drugs. Well one morning I woke up and walked into the bathroom and got a big heaping whiff of meth; a distinct smell thats pretty Hard to forget and even harder to mistake. I called them out on it and they fessed up; only for me to ask them to share with me if they wanted to stay. By this time I knew I wanted to be sober; but if it's just coincidental then maybe its okay? No, because then more and more things happened that lead me to chase it; finally I found myself again and stayed sober 9 months. I deleted the numbers, blocked the users, and for what had seemed like the millionth time I was sober again. Until one day a few weeks back, an old dealer found my number and gave me an offer that at the time seemed awfully convenient. I had been having cravings for weeks; I substituted sub therapeutic doses of other drugs in attempt to hide my feelings of addiction in other highs, only to find that all it took was one message from a dealer for me to completely backtrack and start using again.. so here I am 3 weeks in; and I've decided I wont continue this use any longer; I've given myself a deadline that I believe I can uphold; but in the meantime I'm still fighting this battle..
Wish me luck.",3

recently, i became friends with one of my friends exes, and she happens to have an adderall prescription for her ADHD, which she never takes (hates how it makes her feel) and is selling because they broke up and she‚Äôs now homeless. 

well about 2 years ago, before i ever became addicted to meth i was really badly addicted to adderall. so obviously i did what any rational person in that situation would do. i traded 40$ and a vape for 8 20MG IRs. and then they ran out, so i bought 20 more. 

for the last 3 days, i‚Äôve been taking 2 in the morning before work and 2 more to redose once i start to come down and feel shitty. i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôm physically addicted yet, but i do know that the emotional dependence is definitely there. 

i don‚Äôt want to see myself fall down the rabbit hole again, but i cannot bring myself to go to rehab again. i‚Äôm only 17 years old, and i‚Äôve spent over 2 years of my life in various rehabs and facilities of all types and i can‚Äôt do it anymore. i‚Äôm starting college soon and i finally have a real job, and i don‚Äôt wanna mess that all up. 

i really need advice and help and i feel like i have nowhere to turn to. i know i should toss these last pills i have but i can‚Äôt bring myself to waste them. i‚Äôm trying so hard to exercise self control and not just pop three right now so that i‚Äôll stop feeling like a complete scumbag. 

thank you if you read all that, sorry it‚Äôs so long. please let me know anything you think would help ‚ô•",10

A couple of weeks ago I decided to take it along with edibles and experienced a pleasantly mild euphoria. About two days ago I did it again but had a horrible experience that left me feeling overheated, anxious, and extremely paranoid among other things. I got so scared that I panicked and threw a fresh bottle of pills in the toilet. After coming down, I was annoyed with myself for discarding them but I knew that it was what I needed. I haven't been productive on them in a while and they make my chest tight and cause me to experience shortness of breath, not to mention the insomnia. I'm scared of what my world will look like and *feel* like without them but I think I'm losing myself. So I want to know, would using low doses of marijuana edibles help to counteract the withdrawal symptoms? I know they're gonna be a bitch to get through! Does taking another drug defeat the purpose of getting off of amphetamines? Should I just suck it up and do it all sober?",5

* **relapse** - when an addict returns to alcohol or drugs after a period of sobriety. A relapse can be a detrimental and deadly affair with devastating consequences.

* **slip** - a situation where someone has a very brief ‚Äúslip‚Äù where they drink or use, but they stop quickly afterward, avoiding a full relapse into addiction.

i hope this helps anyone who needs it. this isn't to give us an excuse to use again, but it's more of a reminder that yes - mistakes happen. realistically, the road to recovery isn't straight & narrow rather than full of twists and turns. at some point in your entire life, you PROBABLY will use again *but* it's up to you what happens after that. just know that if you use again, it doesn't have to lead to a relapse. it doesn't negate all of your days of sobriety before that.

This is the first time I haven't felt disappointed in myself for using. I've known for the past couple weeks that I would without a doubt. A lot of personal turmoil combined with a death was enough for me to decide that. That if I was going to use for any reason it would be because of this. 

I ended up buying some, I know it's a bad idea, I don't want to use it except in emergency. Because if things get too bad I didn't want to sell my soul by using sex to get gear. I want to keep my choice on what I do with my body. I would rather the risk of using again to the risk of putting myself in unsafe situations, unprotected sex, and ruining my self worth.

I honestly don't know if I'm going to do it again. It feels like my initial reasons for quitting are miles away from my current priorities. I'm a different person to who I was 8 months ago when I decided to quit for real, in that time I've only used twice. 

I know it's trying to convince me that I can keep it under control this time. That I can hide it from my friends and get away with it. That I can do every once and awhile while sticking to my commitments. I believe it while also knowing it's a lie, the ultimate doublethink. 

I've tried to make a contingency plan to try and prevent using, or delay as long as possible. At very least if I do fail by going back I will be taking every harm reduction method possible. But I know I'm just trying to justify it to myself. 

I know I'll lose close friends if they find out. The threat of legal ramifications looms in my mind. Then there's my health and sanity. I was sick all the time, I was paranoid and not myself until a long time afterwards. I didn't enjoy living anymore.

2020-03-03 12:15:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/fcxtt7/will_the_arrhythmia_ever_go_away/,Will the arrhythmia ever go away?,"I‚Äôve been sort of fighting an off and on addiction to Adderall for the past few years of my life (college, surprise, surprise), and while I never felt like a full fledged addict (knowing damn well than I am), my main concern has always been with my heart.

My main usage pattern has typically always been along the lines of ‚Äútake 2-3 30mg XR‚Äôs, dosing a large amount at first and then taking smaller bumps throughout the duration, staying up for two days, and then crashing, waiting a few days, and then repeat‚Äù.  Sometimes I‚Äôll have a moment of clarity where I realize I need to cut this shit out, and I‚Äôll stay clean for a few weeks or a month or two, but then I always end up falling back into the same pattern.

While I honestly feel fine aside from a lack of motivation, I‚Äôve got a lot of anxiety built up over my heart health, and I‚Äôm constantly wondering if I really fucked up or if everything will return to normal eventually.  I‚Äôve had a lot of different ‚Äúside effects‚Äù that I‚Äôve experienced over the length of my addiction, but most recently, my heart beat has been my main concern.  I‚Äôll admit, I used about two days ago.  Took a 30 when I woke up, and then took small doses of a second capsule throughout the day, taking my final dose around midnight, topping off at 60mg total.  I stayed up until around 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning.  Slept for maybe a couple of hours.  Woke up, went to work, got home, and then watched Netflix until I finally passed out around midnight.

Now, my main concern:  It‚Äôs been two days now, and despite not having touched the stuff, I feel this light ‚Äúpressure‚Äù in my upper chest, just below my collarbone, but like, in the center.  I don‚Äôt always notice it, especially if I‚Äôm moving around and doing things, but when I lay still, that‚Äôs when it gets me.  It‚Äôs weird.  I feel like I have this constant need to ‚Äútouch it‚Äù or tap on it in order to calm myself down.  This leads me to believe that there‚Äôs definitely some anxiety at play, but the fact that it seems to intensify after I‚Äôve used and then typically goes away once I‚Äôve been clean a while leads me to also believe to Adderall has something to do with it.  Vasoconstriction, perhaps?

However, I‚Äôve also noticed that my heartbeat seems really irregular.  Once again, due to the anxiety, I find myself constantly checking my pulse throughout the day.  Sometimes it‚Äôs normal.  Other times it‚Äôs 100+ despite having been laying in bed for hours.  It‚Äôs driving me insane.  Sometimes when I check my pulse, it‚Äôll feel relatively regular, but after this most recent binge, even now, two days later, every time I check it, it sounds like:

Dundun dundun dundun Duuuuuhhhhhdun DUNDUNDUNDUNDUN Dundun dundun

.... If that makes any sense.  A series of normal beats followed by one slower beat, and then a few really fast beats, almost like it‚Äôs trying to make up for that slow beat.  I‚Äôve been reading up a lot on cardiac arrhythmia, and I know this shit is only going to make me more paranoid, but I am genuinely concerned.  I like to exercise. I like to lift weights, but this issue I‚Äôve been having has had me scared to go to the gym.  I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll have a sudden cardiac arrest due to pushing the arrhythmia, and then that‚Äôll be the end.

Another thing is that I unfortunately don‚Äôt know if I ever had any sort of arrhythmia before, because I never really paid attention to it before.  I feel like the drugs are what triggered it, but now I‚Äôm fucking sick of it, and I just want it to go away.  I‚Äôm constantly anxious, and it‚Äôs been debilitating, especially coming from someone that never really had any problems with anxiety before.

So, my final question, like the title says:  Will it ever go away?  Has anyone here ever had a similar experience?  Should I see a doctor ASAP, or is it not really a cause for concern?

I don‚Äôt currently have a primary care physician, but I‚Äôm looking into finding one.

In the mean time, I just need some reassurance or, at least, a blunt dose of reality.  I‚Äôm really glad I found out that this sub existed.  I know a lot of users here are coming from a meth addiction, and I‚Äôm so lucky I‚Äôve never had access nor the desire to try it, because I have a feeling I probably wouldn‚Äôt make it out alive, but I love how supporting this community is.  Reading everyone‚Äôs stories has calmed me down, so I figured I might finally speak up and hear what you guys have to say.
