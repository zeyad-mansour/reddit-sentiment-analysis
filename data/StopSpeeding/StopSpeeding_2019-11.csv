I've been snorting Euro speed paste pretty heavily over the past months with very little breaks. I've been wanting to stop but I can't seem to stop until it's gone and then of course I contact my plug for more. It's the most fiendish of habits. Anyway, I have lost my current stash so I'm now 24 hours CT from this nasty habit. I don't feel too bad at all a bit of anxiety and depression but my energy is okay so far. I've taken breaks in the past and been extremely lucky not to experience much withdrawal but I know I am pushing my luck and I keep telling myself I will stop, but never do. Are my withdrawals/PAWS likely to worsen in the coming days or weeks? I've heard Day 1 is the easy part. I want to be done with this habit as I have zero self control with it or any drug for that matter. I haven't had any sleepless nights on this stuff but there have been nights I've only had a few hours. I work a very demanding job that requires a sharp mind so I don't want to be utterly useless and hoping for an easier time. How does the withdrawal from this stuff stack up against prescription amps? From what I've been reading, adderall etc. appear to have worse withdrawal. I'm scared of messing up my neuro chemistry and frying my receptors too so I must stop this before I dig the hole deeper. This drug absolutely has 100% control over me. I have kratom but don't want to use it having been through the withdrawal from that too many times to count. It was even worse than speed for me and dragged on for months before I felt okay again. I lost a girl I liked from this habit and my work and personal care is suffering too from deteriorating mental health. I seem to hate being sober and always looking to alter my reality in some way. My nose is also fucked from this shit and coke binges and it's sore and seems to have a minor infection. Thanks guys.",2,1

I was thrown on painkillers when I was a child and they worked for a while but with chronic pain I had no motivation. 

For years I've felt like my body was working against me. When I turned 17 or 18 I started doing coke, vyvanse, adderall, anything to help with the motivation and depression. 

I got sober at 20 and stayed sober from everything (including pain meds) for 10 months. I had great tools from rehab, IOP, and meetings, but no one ever addressed the physical pain. My doctors wanted me back on narcotics. 

After 10 months I was so tired of being in constant pain and not having the will to get out of bed except to go to meetings (and not even that constantly) that I got back on my painkillers. But I still didn't want to do anything. So I started doing out and drinking but it didn't help. Then at my new job, a coworker offered me adderall and vyvanse when he saw that I was tired and dragging. I knew I shouldn't but I accepted. That turned to me picking up coke once every month or two, then once a month, now it's every few days so that I have enough everyday. I ran out yesterday and was so fucked from withdrawals that I started screaming at my family. Then I had to come clean. 

Now I'm on 24 hours of my detox and I have to work in the morning but all I want to do is cry and pick up. I'm in desperate need of help but feel too ashamed to call my old sponsor or friends in the program.

Adderall is No Fucking Joke: An Absolute Rant and Confessions of an Extreme Type A Adderall Addict," lets go baby. 

So I wanted to provide an update on my 14 days since I last posted about my extreme Adderall abuse in grad school, and then a video brought me to tears of self pity and hate to more hope.

This rant of emotions starts super negative but **I promise‚Ä¶rant ends positively**, if you stick with me. Us Type-As have a tendency to go overboard and overshare - even when not on aderalll.

First things let me get it off my chest: I fucking hate grad school. Okay moving along.

2 weeks later: update ‚Äî> I‚Äôm worse. Grad school has magnified every single one of my underlying issues into extreme problems. I feel like I have to perform top tier all the time producing unrealistic work. 

When im off Adderall Im a crying, unstable, emotional mess angry human. When im on Adderall, im highly functioning focused producing stellar results organized for my peers and superiors. I understand regression models with Adderall but more importantly, I dont hate them because of Adderall. Dangerous thing that is. Then when i check canvas and see my grade is this highest I get this little high i cant even describe- such intense satisfaction feeding the addition. but im giong to burn tf out. 

My dose update since my last post is I take at least 80mg a day getting up to 200 in one awful day with an average of 120mg in 16 hours roughly. Last post I received Dms telling me this dose was insane, and I was like **shiiiit if the people of reddit are even saying you have a problem - u have a problem** \- YET I DIDNT STOP- I WENT UP. 

My paranoia is insane, i think every comment is a personal attack. I miss the old me. I miss my confident self. I used to get attention for being wholesomely confident and not arrogant -  now every guy is like literally holy shit ‚Ä¶unstable school crazed psycho girl STAY AWAY. Somehow ive rationalized that its okay for school to be my ENTIRE life - thats now how I wanna live.

I can‚Äôt believe i wrote last 135 bc I‚Äôm now 126...i used to work our 5-6 days a week and I‚Äôm lucky if i do 1-2. So i know a lot of this is muscle loss which sickens me, but also now adds to I‚Äôm scared of gaining weight bc i have a history of binge eating - i am just one of those fucking **extreme people**. Like i can‚Äôt just do anything without taking it too far. **Always, im always pushing limits**. My skin is also getting worse, like I consider myself averagely attractive, and I dont want to lose my outward appearance bc my inward appearance is just getting uglier and uglier.

My paranoia has gotten worse and my perfectionism is driving me crazy. It is clear i am a mess from the outside and my energy is toxic. I can‚Äôt quit cold turkey before finals, **BUT** i made an appointment with a psychologist specializing in perfectionism and ‚Äúgoal oriented high achieving‚Äù individuals with an emphasis on mood disorders...i hope it helps‚Ä¶I had to after every interaction this week I cried during without reason‚Ä¶friends, professors (so embarrassing), TA, random dunkin lady, etc, I was like I w t f I cant regulate a single emotion.

Also **PROTIP**: Do not email your professors while whacked out on Adderall at 3am with 6 paragraphs. They will reply condescendingly and your self -esteem will decrease when ur not on ur high.

I‚Äôm scared tho because I‚Äôm sick of this drug but i know when I‚Äôm not motivated, when i don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve proved myself enough, when I feel like I can MAKE SOMETHING BETTER‚Ä¶.I‚Äôm gonna go for my pills and that‚Äôs terrifying that dependence fucking with ur brain.

I pulled an all nighter for no reason last night doing BUSY work and during it i felt amazing like a weird high of productivity feeling like it had no end, now I‚Äôm like wtf why?!?‚Ä¶.still unable to sleep after taking 2mg of klonepam and 4mg of zanflex (that my doctor prescribed btw).

 **Curious about some of the examples demonstrating I‚Äôve fucking completely lost it:**

I‚Äôve hung thick blankets over my windows so i can‚Äôt tell what time it is to trick my body, my body doesn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs 10am when I‚Äôve been hard at work since popping addy since 5pm ha. I dont know know the time, so I can pretend what I‚Äôm doing is normal. (Ill post a follow up pic post).

**Another example of: oh shit the girl has a problem**:

I cashed in 400 of bonds that my deceased grandma, the biggest role model in my life ive ever had, gave me to purchase Adderall that I had to drive an hour to and from for. I feel sick.

Omg im am sincerely **SORRY for all this negatively**, I‚Äôm on a bad comedown and just wanted to write how I felt. But I **swear my original intention of this post was positive:** I wanted to shout out **@lex\_taliones\_ video of adderall addiction** that was so spot on. I wanna post a video like that one day and be that open. It was real and that was me.  **MUCH LOVE to this girl on her recovery** ‚ù§Ô∏è. Although im not at a point of completely stopping, I know I need changes. Im taking steps with the psychologist and this video gave me hope and made me feel not stupid for feeling those same erratic emotions. I need a mindset change is what I need. I was great before my addiction, i can be great after. I just need help retraining my brain:( 

I hope my next update is a more positive one as I try to navigate finals. If you stayed with through any of this - thank you and please watch her amazing video that brought me to teats. Its so crazy how u can think you‚Äôre alone, but you‚Äôre not ..**youre not alone**.",16,0

I took a lot of time to myself to look at my program and figure out what needed to be added to it to avoid further relapses. 
I implemented some new things, including alcohol anonymous literature. The Big Book has great insight for addiction, I just interchange alcohol with crystal meth. 
My sponsor got me the 12 steps and traditions, I‚Äôm going to begin reading that. I‚Äôm not a huge religious guy either so I just refer to any mention of God to instead my own higher power. 
It‚Äôs silly to dismiss these amazing tools just because of terminology used in it. 
I also began to journal. I don‚Äôt always get a chance to make an entry nightly but I average 4 entries a week. It really helps me process things from my day I have built up that I forgot about, so I don‚Äôt go into tomorrow with baggage from the previous day. It helps me recognize what I need to work on so I know to implement things opposed to just going about things the same way & again becoming overwhelmed to the point of relapse. 

I feel a lot better. In the last 117 days or so I‚Äôve only used for 2 days & that is insane to me. For 3 years I haven‚Äôt been able to get beyond 2 weeks without using.

A lot of them. By 18, my shamanic journey had dead ended into opiate addiction. Like a Final Destination movie, I had pissed off Death with what were surely close to death experiences (that, thankfully I am unable to remember most details of, thanks to the drugs that were killing me while rendering me amnesiac). 

I started with oxy
Then came Suboxone to ‚Äútreat‚Äù it
Then alcohol to ‚Äútreat‚Äù suboxone
And finally meth to ‚Äútreat‚Äù alcohol

And in the midst of that I contracted Hep C, a potentially fatal liver virus, from sharing needles with my sons father. 

Now, 10 years and a suicide attempt later, I am still struggling with meth addiction. And I saw a doctor of infectious disease today for the first time since my diagnosis. 

I am a very sick girl. My viral load was staggering, even more shocking than the realization that I probably have taken 15 years off of my life in the last ten. 

15 years is the age of my son.  I might have liver cancer in the next five. 

The selfishness of my choices is nauseating. The blatant disregard for a child who didn‚Äôt choose an addict for a mother and now very well may be stuck caring for a dying one. Or maybe if he‚Äôs lucky he can bury her before he is old enough to drink. 

So today is my day one. I could use all the help I can get with this.  My son is an avid Redditor who set up my account and pushed me into your lives. Lucky you :)

im gonna quit by just reducing my dose slowly until im off, currently i take 80 mg of vyvanse and 10-15 mg dextra a day, but today i only took 80 vyvanse and 5 dextra. it doesnt sound like a lot but im really struggling rn to not take that extra 5 mg pill.

i cant tell if my ""reducing dose"" strategy will actually work or if im just procrastinating because im too afraid to cut it out completely. also, i dont know if i want to quit because i want to get better, or if its just going to be a tolerance break. ive quit and gone back so many times i dont really trust myself",13,0

What's your experience?,"I've been taking too much for a while and of course have now ran out altogether. I will have to wait just over 2 weeks to have my script filled.

This is probably a good thing because my tolerance has become stupid, and it really doesn't do much any more. 
There's a lot on here about Addy as I guess that's common the US but we only really get methylphenidate here.

When I was starting out 10mg was great and 20mg was actually too much in some cases (insufflation) but now it's probably nearer to the 100mg mark over a day. Never used more than 36mg in one go in this way (as Concerta, which I peeled and has a lot of filler and crap so probably works out less as it's not as well absorbed).

There's not much info specifically about methylphenidate but it's usually lumped in with amphetamine. Seems to indicate that tolerance takes a week or two to drop so I am hoping after this I will not need as much.

Just a bit concerned how it will affect me mentally, I was using about 100mg a day which will be going to zero. 

I have had the odd day off but that may not be long enough to experience withdrawal (if there is any) so I'm a bit concerned that it will end up being a horrendous few weeks. 

Usage has been around 100mg a day and it's a waste really because I just end up buzzing but unproductive. I'll write essays to people in messages and then crash afterwards. I guess without it I feel really bored and time is incredibly slow and it's an easy way to not feel bored while at the same time not having to do anything. I would be taking it just to watch YouTube marathons which is so pointless.

Ultimately I think it will be good for my body to reset tolerance and actually eat adequate food.",8,0

I have no desire to increase my dosage, and I have a full prescription right now in my bathroom and I am responsible steward of my medication.
 
To be honest I hate amphetamine induced euphoria more than anything now. It used to be my world. The pills were my friend and my reason for being. They were my secret weapon but I now I realize I‚Äôm holding a butter knife

Literally everything I thought I was for the past 15 years is basically a lie and it‚Äôs goddamn terrifying to sense that truth, and when I sensed the call in my heart to finally put these damns pills down you know what I said to myself?

I don‚Äôt want to get fat.

That‚Äôs all I have left now. That‚Äôs my excuse.

I have nothing going for me no job,no future prospects on my mind. I just go to the gym everyday and workout for three hours and then go home.

I mean I don‚Äôt think I know what happiness is, what accomplishment really feels like, and my existence right now isn‚Äôt so terrible-

It‚Äôs just totally pointless.

Deep down the pills were a mask all along and I‚Äôm still that scared fat little kid who thought adderall was a good way to get through high school. 

Now here I am 15 years later with nothing left but a vague hope that life will get better when I let go- I have no assurances I‚Äôve been down this road before. 

It‚Äôs never really the substance that‚Äôs the issue it‚Äôs the self. It‚Äôs me.

So, when I do make the decision today, tomorrow,next week or next month could someone tell me it‚Äôs going to be alright,cause I don‚Äôt know which parts of me are real and which parts are just side effects.

Is it worth it? Is it really all the fault of these pills that I‚Äôve got basically nothing going for me, or is it my fault, maybe I don‚Äôt need to make such a drastic choice. 

Maybe I can make it with the pills, I mean since I‚Äôm not abusing them what‚Äôs the problem? Maybe with a high tolerance and so little effect I can learn to really cope with life and do things.

I suppose that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been telling myself. Maybe it‚Äôs true?

So I guess I have a few excuses left after all.

Can anyone relate to my story-literally relearning what it means to be a human adult after years of believing that the real you was a goofy mess that needed to die so you could succeed at life. 

The life everyone else wanted me to live,with a 9-5 job that I don‚Äôt fucking have and probably never will and goddamn a house and a fucking car...

I need help I suppose, today my heart unclenched it‚Äôs fists and finally let go, I don‚Äôt know when that‚Äôll translate into quitting-but I know I‚Äôll die if things stay this way. 

I know that deep down these pills won‚Äôt be in my near future and it is so scary to acknowledge that fact.",6,1

The end of yet another 6-day binge unemployed with no money, clothes, living in a room at my grandmas because she's the only one stupid enough to continue giving me chances to improve my life. I'm in and out of jail for petty stupid traffic shit because I am too spun out to bother showing up to court and too broke to pay my fines, divorced from my wife, 3 kids I almost never see who have watched me deteriorate with confused, sad eyes, and the contempt of most people that were once my friends and family.

I've been on a cycle for the past 8 months or so where I've basically ""quit"" every time I ran out of my supply, go about a week or two clean and feeling like there's no doubt I've finally nailed the addiction, and then -bam- the dragon chase is on.  Spending all your time stuck in a room in in front of a computer screen with 57+ porn tabs and no social interaction of any kind - unless you count constant sexting of any girl willing to do it with you (and digusting attempts at many who arent).

Making it a month hasn't happened in so long I can't even remember what that feeling would be like, much less 6 months or a year or life.

As the title said, I'm currently a little over a month clean from an IV meth and heroin addiction, and while life has gotten *so* much better in that short period of time, I kind of feel like I'm white knuckling it and fear that I'm on the verge of a relapse on meth specifically. I don't know why, but I've only had relatively mild passing cravings for opiates, but my cravings for meth have been constant and almost unbearably intense. So I thought maybe it would help if I made this account and joined some recovery-oriented subs for support.

I started using in December 2015 and have been trying on and off to get clean since July 2018. I'm what treatment centers call a ""chronic relapser,"" and my most vulnerable period seems to be the point I'm at right now -- 4 to 6 weeks clean. I've never made it past 62 days. Granted, I've always been kind of ambivalent about quitting -- I have severe treatment-refractory depression (meaning it hasn't responded well to medication, ECT, etc) and drugs are the only thing I've found that makes it go away, even for a little bit. However, the cost of using has become higher than I'm willing to continue paying. I've been homeless, prostituted myself, dropped out of high school, been unable to hold a job, and had multiple psychotic breaks as a result of my use. My biggest wake-up call was last month, when 2 days after checking into detox for heroin withdrawal I suddenly experienced cardiopulmonary arrest. They did CPR and were able to get my heart beating again, but I remained in the ICU on a ventilator in critical condition for 5 more days. Thankfully by some miracle I made a full recovery with no brain damage, but it was terrifying. They discovered while I was in a coma that I have what's called left ventricular hypertrophy -- basically, the left ventricle of my heart is abnormally enlarged, rendering it unable to beat normally, due to chronic stimulant abuse. Mixing uppers and downers was the proverbial nail in the coffin as it can cause arrhythmias even in people with healthy hearts. I'm only 19. I'm not ready to die, and this catastrophe opened my eyes to the fact that I am not going to live a long life if I don't make some serious changes. 

When I came home from the hospital, I moved back in with my grandparents and broke up with my boyfriend (who I'd been living with before). I went from living in a large city to now being in my rural Midwestern hometown. It's been a bit of a culture shock. The boredom is oppressive. I've been trying to keep busy and take care of myself (I just got back into running and clean eating), but it's hard because I have zero. Freaking. Motivation. I think about getting high constantly. I have using dreams almost every night, and they're extra disturbing because before when I had them I never actually got high, but now I'm actually able to find a vein and do my shot, and I even feel the rush. It's so weird. I haven't told anyone in my support system yet because I was too ashamed, but a few days ago I broke down and shoplifted a Benzedrex inhaler and ate the cotton hoping it would scratch the itch even just a little. It didn't. Deep down I really don't want to use. My family is even offering me these amazing incentives if I can stay on the right track -- they've promised to give me a car and take me on a vacation abroad next summer. I'm allowed to live at home rent free if I'm clean. They're being careful not to make me feel pressured to get a job or even do too many chores. I'm so grateful for them and what they're doing for me is amazing. I just wish I could be happier with this incredible jumpstart on my new life. But still I feel like I'm terrifyingly close to doing something stupid that I'll regret, something that may kill me.

So yeah. That's pretty much what's going on with me. I partly just kinda wanted to vent, but I'd also love to know if anyone else has gone through something similar and how you dealt with it. Also feel free to offer suggestions on what affordable easy activities/hobbies I can pick up and do by myself in the middle of nowhere.

I see a disappointing trend of self medication, and the worst part is- people are oblivious that it‚Äôs self medication.

My point being said, I‚Äôm shocked by the number of severely uneducated kids out there. I‚Äôm young (24) but to see 14-20 year olds acting as if the gates of heaven have been opened because maybe for once they actually felt normal or better after they tried a drug and then chase that feeling- completely ignoring the fact that the drug made have made them feel better due to the fact they have an unknown issue to begin with that made them extra anxious or depressed.


Their idea of being aware of addicts is picturing someone snorting coke, or someone doing heroin in an ally way- that‚Äôs how they view ‚Äòdrugs‚Äô and they don‚Äôt understand that if drugs made everyone feel great and were safe no one would be addicted and dying. 

And don‚Äôt even get me started on, ‚ÄúI did it before and I was fine. I‚Äôll only do it on weekends...‚Äù blah blah.  Sorry,, rant is over lol.

I was clean and sober for 2 years... I landed a job in a field and I thought this was my opportunity to break through. A high school drop out with a GED, 28 years old with some college credit- this was it. 

I quickly worked my way into a leadership role in this small company- and it required a lot of paperwork, with many tasks, and attention to detail. I was making quota, and boss was happy- but this just kept bringing me back. 

Got prescribed vyvanse- worked wonders, took it as prescribed. 

Fast forward 1 year. 

I get offered a job doing business development for one of if not the largest providers in the space. 

Health insurance termed- could no longer afford vyvanse. Switched to adderall XR. All is well. 

Work is extremely high demand- long hours, 50-75 phone calls some days, stacked on top of 3-4 meetings a day, and data entry. BUT I am excelling-I‚Äôm being noticed. 

Get promoted to director of business development at my site. However... 30mg of xr not doing it- I‚Äôm crashing. 

Doc prescribed 20 mg IR booster.... this is where it all goes down hill. 

Work load increases, pressure and demand increases. Sometimes it‚Äôs 60 hour weeks- but I‚Äôm excelling. Getting kudos from the VP and CMO for the entire corporation. 

Tolerance hits- start adjusting my dose as I see fit. Before I know it it‚Äôs 80 mgs of adderall. 

Go off of it for a month- go back on except I‚Äôm only going to take on week days- wrong, work has to be done on weekends. Tolerance back up- then off again.!

Then back on- running out, having to get from a friend to hold me over until next script- BUT- I got promoted to acting CEO at my facility (temporary) I‚Äôm excelling! 

And here I am. I have worked 17 of the last 19 days. I‚Äôm up to 120-140mga of adderall. Using it so I can power through work- as I have to to be on point at ALL times. I feel strung out, disgusting, like I‚Äôm missing out on life, I‚Äôm so unhappy. 

Fuck this. Week after next, I am taking a week off- and I‚Äôm going cold turkey. 

My doc prescribed my klonopin- I don‚Äôt need it, except I have taken it 3 x. One .25 mg dose, one .12mg dose and one more .25 dose. I‚Äôm using it to fall asleep. 

I won‚Äôt take this again. I will save 10 pills for the 9 days off. If I need them I‚Äôll use them- but I‚Äôm flushing the rest of my prescription.

Any recovering addict knows you need to find some activity that takes you out of your head, gives you something to focus on and feels rewarding. I finally found mine: puzzles. Like the jigsaw kind.

That feeling never lasted. Soon found out how much of a problem I really have (family has enabled this unintentionally for as long as I've been on it...8 years ago). Damage has been done there...I feel like a piece of garbage that has pushed away anyone who cared about me. Thankfully, I still have those very few that care on me regardless.

Haven't really had any hope for finding something or a reason to finally kick this awful drug. Other than my life feeling like absolute hell with how much I hate myself for not being able to quit this for the past 3 years knowing that this is doing more harm than good. 

Anyways, figured I'd share a song with you guys that I found today. It's ""The Girl on Drugs"" by Wale. Hope it touches some like it did when I listened to it the first time. It striked a nerve somewhere for me. Another one that had me in tears is ""Disease"" by Beartooth. Let me know what you think :)

Been silently reading your posts on here for awhile. Trying to find hope. Or some reason to give this up for good. I hope one day I'll get there. I think I'm getting closer. Been wanting to try out therapy because I barely talk about this to anyone (that knows what I'm going through at least).

Over two months after my first attempt at removing the hard drive on my other laptop (and subsequently discovering that all my screwdrivers were too big), I finally went down to the local Officeworks today and bought myself some tiny screwdrivers. Had a good conversation with the cashier, then went to the supermarket, and forgot to get either of the things that I went in there for, which sucked, though I did find a Wispa for fifty cents (would usually be like 5-6x that where I am). So I went to the other supermarket and got the things there instead. Went home and my cat was waiting for me at the door :)

This was an involuntary break from stimulants, but despite being mad about that for the previous nine days, I can honestly say I don't care. I might get back on it at some point, I might not, but all in all I can say that self ""medicating"" (I use that in the loosest sense of the term, this shit isn't medicine) was a bad idea. Not the worst idea I've ever had, but definitely up there.

Is sex different during meth withdrawals? Is it more difficult to stay hard? Is premature ejaculation more likely? Do orgasms not feel as great? Does sex help the withdrawals? Does the narcolepsy maybe make people want to finish early because they are too fatigued to keep going? Does sex feel better for guys over time the longer they are clean?

I ended my prescription a few months ago which is when this started. At this point, I find it so extremely difficult to quit because I've gotten so used to this. I fear I won't be able to do anything, that I'll turn into some lazy slob despite wanting to do stuff.

After I got on these drugs, I finally taught myself how to code. I've been wanting to do that for over 10 years. These drugs make it so effortless to sit down, write code and actually enjoy what would otherwise feel like a frustrating process. Any day I don't take it, I won't code. I had a period where I managed to stay away for 20 days roughly and I didn't code at all during that period.

I'm scared I'll go back to feeling dumb and lazy. I want to code, I've always wanted to, and I enjoy creating stuff. But I just can't muster the willpower to do it without these drugs. I've always struggled with that. 

It feels like I only have two choices. Either, I quit stimulants, go back to the person I was who struggled with applying myself and just deal with it. Or, I remain on stimulants, embrace the social anxiety, irritation and isolation and be somewhat okay because I get to do what I've always wanted to do.
 
Just that choice to quit is so hard to make. I feel like I'll lose no matter what I pick :( I want to figure out how to deal with these problems without stimulants. But I don't know where to begin. The pill is easier :(

I guess I'm just looking for stories similar to mine where they figured out how to keep pursuing their interests without stimulants. It's easy to feel alone and isolated with problems like these :/ So much taboo and judgment.",11,0

When will it end?,"Title says it all. Been using for 3 years now. I‚Äôll go 2 months maximum without meth, I‚Äôll start feeling somewhat normal again without it, gain my weight back, get healthier, fix my sleeping routines etc but it always finds its way back into my life at the most random of times. I‚Äôll relapse and use for two weeks until my body can‚Äôt take it anymore/I feel like garbage then clean up for a month or two and repeat. 

I used daily for over a year. Snorting and smoking but mostly snorting. Barely ate barely slept. It was gross. I got disgustingly skinny, looked like a rat. Now it‚Äôs gotten to the point where whenever I relapse, the first 2-3 days are satisfying then every minute I‚Äôm high after that I‚Äôm guilt ridden, feel weak, sick, anxious, jittery, angry, embarrassed, paranoid... I only have the motivation to get clean when I‚Äôm high. It‚Äôs a bit ironic saying that and contradicting but idk... if that eve  makes sense. I get high and I feel more, passionate and happy with the idea of getting my life together and getting clean yet I continue using. My family believes I‚Äôm clean as well as my significant other. I‚Äôve been in a relationship for 8 months now and the first 3 months were incredible. I was falling so in love and was so in love. I was a different me. But after 3 months I started relapsing and I turned into a different person and every time I get sober I can‚Äôt feel the same way I used to. I don‚Äôt love them anymore. I show little emotion or affection, I‚Äôm distant, I‚Äôm monotone. I feel like a piece of shit. I can‚Äôt give them anything good. They are deeply in love with me but I don‚Äôt deserve it. I can‚Äôt leave them cuz I still love them I just don‚Äôt know how to show it. I feel like I spend all my time wallowing and hating myself that I can‚Äôt love or appreciate anyone around me. 

How do I end this once and for all. Does anyone have experience with relationships and having a significant other while relapsing and using and feeling like they‚Äôre losing touch with their partner?? How do I fix myself? How do I make this relationship work? We‚Äôre poanning our lives together and I can‚Äôt and don‚Äôt want to leave them.",4,0

So as title states, 38 days today with 0
Adderall after taking it non prescribed since 2010 (most heavy during 2013-2017 for college and then heavy 2017-2019 due to working in a research lab )  I tapered for two weeks then went cold turkey .

Quick withdrawal timeline  symptom recap:
 Days 1-3: normal adderall comedown. (My dumbass thought this was withdrawal) 
Days 4-7: I‚Äôm getting there, this isn‚Äôt so bad. 
Days 7-16: Giant ball of depression, anger, and anxiety along with physically ill 
Day 21 and forward: not too bad and I‚Äôm less anxious But I‚Äôve done some research.

Since being clean, I noticed there‚Äôs been a pattern in my life lately. (Basically when I abused the most in January)  I‚Äôve just had my episodes of depression and anxiety. It would come and go, but last like two weeks usually then when I was feeling normal,‚ÄôI thought it was fixed.

Did some research, considering oh gosh what if I‚Äôm bi polar at this rate then I found PMDD. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
My adderall abuse kinda fucked up hormones all along. I was on birth control but constantly spotting and having issues but since I didn‚Äôt ever get pregnant then why change it?  

So, after realizing all the chemical imbalances stimulants can cause, and after being off of it now to rationally track the last year. I was able to kinda narrow down to the past year I‚Äôve randomly had two really good weeks then really depressed (also resulting in every adderall consumption) turns out these are the same symptoms of PMDD which is mid-diagnosed as bi polar in woman. Please check it out if you‚Äôre a woman trying to get clean and have a pattern in depression.  This is not the same as PMS by the way, it‚Äôs way worse! 


Anyways, I had some bad days last week but this week I felt good and I‚Äôll be returning to my job finally after 6 weeks on leave on Tuesday.

I was a daily adderall abuser for about two years and an occasional coke/meth/molly user. I won‚Äôt get too deep into the story because it‚Äôs been told on here by others a thousand times. I‚Äôve lurked on here since before I quit. My main reason for posting is to say for those of you who have quit and still suffer from constant physical anxiety months after you stopped, I can say personally that it finally does get better. It took probably close to 9 months to truly feel completely like I did before I ever tried anything (first time was molly/meth).

It‚Äôs been a year of accomplishments that I‚Äôm very proud of. I‚Äôm in a new career that I love. I know it‚Äôs a stereotype but I was one of the straight A college educated types in my corporate job post degree when I first came into contact with any drugs other than weed. It changed everything. I was hooked immediately. My social awkwardness gone. My confidence through the roof and I loved the false euphoria of my brain pumping at a new level. It quickly became an escape from the job I hated making spreadsheets in a cubicle 50 stories above the city. It of course finally caught up with me, but I‚Äôm still lucky and blessed it didn‚Äôt ruin my life. A few scares and close calls finally was my rock bottom that made me decide to quit. I‚Äôd be lying if some days I didnt miss it for a second in the moment of having a good time and knowing how it could be even better. But everyday that I wake up from that, I remember what that next day would have been like if I had fucked up. I‚Äôm happy to be free from it now. 

Im always down to message if you want to talk because I enjoy the community of getting clean. I enjoy the company of people that can relate and know what it‚Äôs like and can share the struggles as well as the accomplishments.",5,0

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone on this forum, after quitting amphetamines, was out on bupropion XL (Wellbutrin) and found that it helped them lose the extra weight or at least not continue gaining. I know that's not what the med is prescribed for. 

I just started 300mg a week ago, prescribed by my NP, at my addiction clinic, and I've noticed a decrease in appetite but I feel like I still keep ballooning.

I don't weigh myself because as a teenager I had an eating disorder and really don't want to fall into that trap again.

But ugh. I'm just feeling so gross. I know this probably sounds vain but I feel it's a legitimate concern. Being off adderall is hard enough. 

That being said, I am doing fucking fantastic in every other regard. The wellbutrin has helped immensely with my mood and energy. 

Being off speed is so wonderful guys. I'm finally starting to have money in my bank account, and my relationships with family and friends have drastically improved.
