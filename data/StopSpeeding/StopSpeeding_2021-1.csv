On that note, fuck you for destroying my meaningful relationships, making me feel worse than I have ever felt about myself, and making every day mundane tasks seem harder than imaginable. 
We shared a solid three years together, first two were relatively fun actually. You were always there for me to cheer me up. Until I couldn't find you for a day or two, my heart would miss you so much I had to call into work and stay in bed all day. Truly, that last year and a half you were so needy you consumed every waking moment I wasn't at work. Even then, I only worked to be able to support your expenses. Eventually I had to even start stealing from my amazing family..but for some reason I loved you enough that it was somehow justified. We were toxic, even though I didn't love you anymore I didn't wanna live without you. I was scared how lonely and broken that would leave me because I was already both. Eventually, my very best friend called me one morning and opened my eyes. She gave it to me straight and told me to get away from you for good. I guess maybe I was so embarrassed because for the first time ever, someone called me out on it. I was naive for ever thinking people didn't know I was trapped. I went from overweight to rocking body in less than 8 months and everyone knows I wasn't stepping in a gym. I did it for you, correction I did it with you. Doesn't really matter, that phone call somehow gave me the strength to call my work and tell them I was gonna need some time off. I was about to get out of them most draining relationship I've ever been in. I was foolish for thinking I could do it in month. I didn't expect you to take my will to live for the next year and a half though. I didn't even know it was possible to sleep 17-20 hours a day for months on end. My whole family was constantly worried that I was actually going to end up killing myself over you.. Not that it didn't sound good on a few occasions. Luckily somewhere deep down I was able to pull the only little bit of strength I had to fight. I couldn't hold down a job, but I really tried. I would do for a couple days, probably the excitement to tell my family I was making steps in the right direction. Then it would fade away and I couldn't pull myself to get showered and ready for the day. I couldn't even look in a mirror, I was so disgusted with myself. Please don't be fooled and think that the thought didn't cross my mind that despite all the damage and pain you had already caused me It was easier to just go crawling back. Fortunately, I had no money. I couldn't even steal the money for you because I had already drained from my loved ones. I spent tens of thousands of dollars on you. I didn't pay my little car payment for you, and I loved that car. I finally was able to get out of bed for an entire day, but I didn't even know that it was possible to be that bored. I didn't have anyone to do anything with anyways. I tried eating, it worked for awhile. Enough to make me double in weight but that got old too. The only thing that helped break the cycle was alcohol. Which was cheaper but much worse. I was an angry drunk. The alcohol did hold me over long enough that my family forced me to go to rehab for two weeks. That was the longest two weeks of my life. I couldn't even be with my other one true love, Lola. I regret all of those days I'd leave her behind, and then after that all the days I didn't get out of bed. Thank God for her, when I got home from rehab and looked in those perfect eyes I realized I was a fool. Loving her is a high unlike any other. I was finally able to  be a good momma, the momma she deserved. That gave me the motivation to get a job, get my shit together. Once I held down the same job for over month it just got easier every day. I still look for you around, and sometimes I even find you. I enjoy our random hangouts here and there. It reminds me of our first time together. That's all I want from you. A reminder that we were good, in the beginning. Also a reminder of how ugly things got in years to follow. So I think for now, we are gonna stay this way.",46,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.5522672533988953}"

My journey of quitting started a week ago when I posted here, but it wasn't until this week that I've stopped. I read A LOT about withdrawal before quitting. I've quit different drugs without any problem or relapse but meth had me worried. I got mentally prepared or so I thought.

That my depression was going to be worst? Fuck, ok. Psychosis? Ok, never had that in my life before but I'll prefer the consequences. Fatigue, anxiety, binge eating, irritability? Damn, I'll deal with that. I didn't took it lightly but I wanted to stop putting poison in my body and that weighted more. But you know what's the first thing that happens when you quit? Immediately you start sleeping a lot. 

Sleeping used to be a scape to me and more than that, for me it is even more important than eating. I dreamed every night, almost all my dreams were lucid and I could do anything I wanted. I used to sleep at 9 or 10pm and wake up at 6-7am every day just because, I couldn't help it, I've always been like this and I love it, it was something I was very proud of. Sleep is beautiful, sacred, holy, I don't know, you got the point. I could even sleep when I used cocaine but meth fucked this up. You know how it goes: lots of days without sleeping and eating. 

Now, this is day 4 for me after quitting. I've been sleeping a lot, A LOOOOT. 18 hours only interrumpted by a quick visit to the bathroom or to the kitchen. When I wake up I can't even open my eyes because of how tired I am but God, how I fucking hate the moment I have to go to sleep. The first night I had the most vivid and visceral nightmare, I woke up scared as fuck and, to my damn bad luck, the sleep paralysis started in that moment. I tried to move, to scream, to do something but I couldn't, then I falled asleep again and had another nightmare. This went on and on. Nightmares about murder, accidents, my family being hurted, people melting, ghosts, drug dealers trying to force me into eating my brother (WTF), rape, fights that come with the company of hallucinations of my boyfriend and friends mocking me for being an useless piece of shit that has done nothing with his life (the hallucinations only happens when I get the sleep paralysis). It is scary as fuck because It feels awfully real. The next night (or the next moment I had to go to sleep again), before I could even sleep completely, the sleep paralysis kicked in again. Woke up after struggling what felt like years and when I tried to sleep again, I kept hearing noises that made me jump off my bed (there was nothing here, it was all in my fucking head). I went to sleep eventually. Had nightmares. Sleep paralysis.

Now I'm fucking terrified of sleeping. The simple thought of it makes my heart go wild, it makes me fucking nervous when it used to be delightful. Last night all this happened again, the paralysis, the nightmares, and I only slept 3 hours. I called my bf and tried to calm because I dreamed about my child being murder by a shadow (I don't even have kids but the feeling... FUCKKKK!). 

I wish I had known about the nightmares before. I wanna sleep like I used to. I hope one day I learn how to forgive me for doing this. I don't feel like using (I mean, yeah, obviously I have the most horrible cravings but I won't fucking touch it). I miss me.",24,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9919986128807068}"

For the last 1 1/2- 2 years I was using meth, for majority of that time it was off and on, rarely used more than a couple days in a row, always slept, drank water, and ate food. Until about 8 months ago, my now ex boyfriend, was in a very dark place, and deep in his addiction to meth. I had a problem with enabling and giving up all of myself for him, leading to me feeding his addiction to keep him happy, but ended up worsening my own problem because I didn’t want to face reality. Almost 6 months ago, my ex tried to kill himself during a psychotic break where he thought the neighbors in the apartment above us were fucking with him, but really he just had about 6 different voices in his head. He tried slitting his neck open in front of me. Luckily I had already called 911 and the cops arrived right as he was cutting into his neck with broken glass. He was committed for a week and a half, then released. During the time he was committed, I told myself that he always controlled everything in our life for the last 6 years, and now he’s gone, I can do and have whatever I want. I wanted to actually experience the drug without him there to control or ruin it. Since that day, I’ve used nearly every single day after. He since came home, was sober but still had voices. Attempted suicide in front of me again, and much more violently, a week after I ended the relationship 2 months ago. He very nearly succeeded. Over the last two months, I’ve used more than I ever have, I lost my job, I’ve been trying to repair the nearly $3,000 worth of damages done to my apartment that I have to fix by myself since he isn’t allowed back on the property or near me due to a no contact order. I lost all but 1 friend, and now have realized meth has ruined my life and the life of someone I once loved that will never be capable of being the same person I fell in love with. So, it’s time to get clean. That, and I have no money left. Today is day 1 of sobriety.

I'm now eight months out from the marijuana and Vyvanse overdose that made me give up both. I still feel pretty awful.

What worries me is that I don't really know if I'll recover any more than I already have. There are two scary variables here:

1. I was prescribed Vyvanse in the first place because a few years ago mononucleosis seems to have attacked my brain and caused some problems: chronic fatigue, brain fog, depression, loss of libido, flattened emotions. It feels like my brain is swollen all the time.
2. Something really bad seemed to have happened during the overdose. Parts of my vision temporarily went dark. In the days after, it felt as if I could only have one thought at a time, like they just sparked slowly in my brain, disconnected from each other. My body felt weird to me. Sometimes, for example, I would try to use the restroom, and my brain felt like it was ""looking"" for the right parts to use. I'm worried I did permanent damage.

These days the fatigue is worse than it was before the overdose, the feeling of my brain being swollen is worse, the depression is worse--I just feel so hopeless. Leading up to the overdose, everything in my life was already falling apart. Now it's fallen apart further, and I don't understand where I'm supposed to get the energy to even begin to put it back together. I spend my days unable to stop thinking about every shameful thing I've ever done, about how there's always seemed to be something off about me, and about all the people I feel would actually enjoy my suffering if they knew the full extent of it. These are horrible thoughts, but I have no will to fight them. And yes, I'm seeing both a talk therapist and a psychiatrist.

I'm aware that people see improvements past the eight month mark. I'm aware also that it may not be surprising that recovery seems unending in the middle of a pandemic. And I am taking steps to improve myself: I read every day, I exercise at least a little, I've been playing video games and piano to stimulate myself. I'm not taking this lying down.

But some days, like today, I just get really scared that this will be my life now. I'm scared that between the post-viral syndrome and overdose, my brain is so trashed that I'll never really enjoy life again.

 I was on these for about 6 years and the 2 years before I was able to switch that addiction to suboxone I was up to using 90 every three days most of the time. I would also take neurontin, fiorcet, lyrica and whatever other pill i could find that would give me a head change.

I have been clean from Adderall, weed and alcohol for two months. I am happy to have hit this milestone. The last thirty days have been very challenging mentally. The first month I had a lot of enthusiasm and new found energy and after I hit Day 25 I fell into a physical and mental slump. I used Adderall every day to start my day since 2016 and I abused it to go above and beyond with work and creative projects in my life.

I can’t get out of bed in the morning. I wake up and my eyes are burning and refuse to open. I am unemployed and collecting unemployment and it has been temperatures below 30 degrees.

For supplements, I take four 500mg L-Tyrosine and four L Dopa in the morning (plus Ashwagandha and Allegra in the evenings and weekly testosterone shots).

I was on a roll with working out every day and using stimulant pre-workouts but out of nowhere my body became very lethargic and I could no longer excite myself to get to the gym. I’ve been bored with working out and eating good. There have been days when I sleep in until 1:00 PM and then I proceed to continue sleeping throughout the day.

I have nowhere to go and nowhere to be and the weather is dreadful. I have been counting the days and counting my blessings. So now I’m passing two months of Adderall abstinence. There have been many days where I can’t start the day to save my life and I know there is a refill bottle just waiting there at the pharmacy. I’m just like “when the F am I going to feel a little  bit of excitement or endorphins towards something?”

I’ve read a lot of stories online and I have found that this two month motivational slump is to be expected with amphetamines. 

I ordered some eye drops that are supposed to Jolt you up in the morning. Usually I can’t get up because my eyes are burning and it’s torture trying to keep them open to start the day before Noon.

Some days I feel Okay and can accomplish a few things and other days I can’t find a single reason to want to get out of bed. I keep telling myself I just have to get through February. I will reach the three month mark and days will start to get warmer and longer 🙏

2021-01-26 04:48:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/l5auhm/so_done_with_adderall/,So done with adderall,I’ve been an adderall/vyvanse addict for 10 years. It has controlled my life for ten whole years. Looking back on the ten years I have accomplished nothing. The only thing I have are some good memories of getting super fucked up. But also memories that embarrass the shit out of me. All because I was so geeked on adderall. I’ve stolen it from friends countless times. Even a boyfriend who took his responsibly. I love the rush of let’s clean the house and do the clothes after not having any for two weeks Bc I used all of mine up within days. The day I go get my prescription I always feel so much better after not being on it and then I do it again. It’s pointless. I don’t leave my house when I’m high Bc I have anxiety now from the high doses I take. I ignore my child and would rather clean or look through my phone. When I don’t take it I can play with her all day. And I find myself missing her even though she is right beside me. It’s the worst guilt imaginable. I’m just sick of it. I will never move forward in life if I continue to take it. I have no ambition to do anything other than things around the house. Not sleeping for days at a time. Scared to see family or friends because I look dead. Or I act dead. It has gone on for far too long and I’m truly ready to be done. Reading these stories about recovery makes me smile and look forward to it.,51,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8229203224182129}"

I need to keep moving on with my life at the least.

Though, I'm wondering how much an employer cares about your personal life. I worry that potentially stupid things from my late teens, that do not represent my character may surface and I'll lose my job or something once I feel safe. 

It sounds illogical but I'm still in that state of feeling like something could go wrong or people from my past are out to get me. 

I'm sweating all of the mis-steps from my life. These thoughts can and have quickly spiralled fast out of control into what would seem like crazy fiction to someone else. Last week I explained to a friend that I was having a genuine sense of dread that I would end up in a foreign gulag, despite never being overseas to have even committed a crime. You might find that laughable, which to me would actually be reassuring, despite these odd delusions feeling real. Thankfully the friend heard me out and didn't make a mockery of me, but tried to reassure me that it was not something that would happen to me. Though on the whole I feel a slight improvement compared to when I last posted here, despite the horror amphetamines have unleashed upon my brain.

Is this fear of getting a job and how it relates to my personal life misplaced? Or is it only famous people and the like who are scrutinised so heavily?

It’s possible folks. But YOU have to want it. Choose speed sobriety for yourself. But why. We all know stimulants feel amazing. I went on a vacation before the second outbreak of COVID-19 and was fucked up on Vyvanse and guess what? It was the best vacation of my life even though I was traveling alone and ran into numerous problems; so much dopamine in my system. But there IS NO FREE LUNCH. There really isn’t.

I’m turning 23 next August. I’m a male from Iceland who works in the artistic field. Growing up, I used to read about all my favorite idols being on cocaine, specifically my favorite musician David Bowie. Also, Stephen King, the writer, who serial published books like a machine. Both were coke heads. Being an author myself, I always had this thought at the back of my head: There are CNS stims out there that can make me a super-performer in my field. I have always been so productivity oriented, yet I’ve had focus problems and arguably ADHD for the longest time, so it was an apparent godsend to discover Vyvanse. But truly, it was a satansend. I would discover that later.

It’s been only 14 months since I first got my script so my stop in the world of hard-core drug addiction was brief but very serious. Last year I made two attempts to quit, in August and October respectively, but to no avail. It lasted exactly three weeks both times. The reason I gave up was because I wasn’t ready to quit for myself. I still loved the drug and thought the love was reciprocated. What a misconception! But now I’m approaching the three-week mark once more. What’s different now? Honestly, the only difference is that I sincerely hate speed now. I don’t want to have anything to do with it again. Ever. Do I still want it? Yes, of course. But what my addiction has taught me is that this is all fake. Being high all the time is a fabricated reality. The consequences are so serious and detrimental. So are the side effects of the drug proper. Or poison I should say. Here are just a few:

1. I became a narcissistic semi-psychopath. I was always a good person. No, I didn’t go around beating people up. I was not violent. I never even partied either. Remember, my party was the productivity; the David Bowie and Stephen King artistic super-performance zone. That’s what I loved. But I stopped caring about people. I had my “soulmate” pharmaceutical speed – so what need did I have for other people. It goes without saying that this severely undermined my relationships.

2. I lost all sense of judgement. One of the side effects of Vyvanse (or any other hard stimulant) is sudden death due to taking on dangerous activities. I became a traffic maniac. 160 km/h (100 mph) was the new norm. It is a miracle that I didn’t kill any innocent person during my addiction. It’s also a miracle I didn’t die myself. And surely it is almost unbelievable that I got away from fines and collisions. I still don’t understand it. The only reason I can thank of is that I was protected by God. There was even this one instance in Germany in August (during my vacation) when I almost caused an unintentional highway massacre and just barely regained control of the car. I was driving on an Autobahn with no speed limit and reached 245 km/h (152 mph) when suddenly a car and a truck entered the highway and I slipped between them. Vyvanse made my insane…

3. No sleep. News flash: sleep is really important for one’s health! If you keep a person awake for too long, they die just from lack of sleep. I was staying up way to long. Usually 40 hours at a time and then I slept 15 hours and repeated the cycle.

4. Anxiety. I also became a benzo addict. I never had anxiety before and took my first benzo last summer. It was a purely speed-induced addiction. Unfortunately, I’m still dependent on benzos to this day because the withdrawals are so damn long. But I’m down to 1 mg of Clonazepam a day.

5. Eye problems. At one point, I thought I would go blind. I stopped being able to use my eyes. This is a combination of a known side effect of Vyvanse and sleep deprivation.

6. Depression. This is a serious one. Both speed and benzos in high doses cause very bad sporadic depression.

7. Zero control of my focus. This was the most annoying side effect by far. Yes, I got laser focused and I loved that. But I just COULD NOT CONTROL my focus. I would pop the pills planning to work on my most recent book for instance and then I would find myself sitting on the toilet for five hours straight writing some bullshit on Reddit with the shit hardened on my ass. I also remember one instance, when I thought it was an excellent idea to empty 10 70 mg Vyvanse capsules and put the powder in a transparent waterproof glass vial in case I would ever need to go on see. And I don’t even sail! What the fuck!? And you can’t even snort Vyvanse. I knew that very well. Still, I spend at least two of the best hours of my high doing this insanity. Plus, the box itself is watertight as is comes from the factory. I know this because when I tried quitting Vyvanse for the second time in October 2020, I poured hot water into the box and shook it frantically and let the plastic capsules and the evil powder therein completely dissolve. Then I flushed it. But only afterwards I realize how bad that is for the environment. But well, maybe I would have died had I not done that. 

I still miss the feeling of being high. But I do not miss these side effects. I feel free now. I’m not nearly as productive. For the first days of my abstinence, I slept 16 hours a night, woke up and still had to take a nap after having been awake for three hours. Essentially one gets to experience CFS (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) when they stop speeding.

But there is hope my friends… I urge you to bid your “soulmate” adieu. I know it’s hard. But please consider all the positives. Now is the perfect time to go to rehab or to do it discreetly at home by yourself like I’m doing. Everybody is at home anyway because of this pandemic thing.

A few tips to help you quit. Drink lots of energy drinks. Red Bull is my favorite. I drink around 1,5 L (50,7 fl.oz.) just to get through the day. I choose the sugar free version because sugar is also an evil drug I don’t want to be addicted to. I know the following might be controversial but I don’t recommend sobriety from all drugs unless you are a poly addict. If speed was your only problem (and something like benzos or booze to go with it or whatever) there is no reason not to take advantage of other drugs to make with withdrawal process easier. Like microdosing acid or shrooms for instance.

Personally, I’ve been using Tramadol to ease my first speedless weeks. My Dad gave them to me because he has a script and doesn’t take that much anymore. Obviously, you have to know yourself. The last thing one wants to do is to replace an addiction with another addiction, let alone an even more serious one like an opioid addiction. But if used as training wheels, I believe various drugs may be beneficial. I’m currently on 100 mg of Tramadol. Therefore, I have the focus to write this post. But I can tell you this much: If I was on Vyvanse right now, I could not write a post like this because I COULD NOT be concise on speed. It just couldn’t. I remember I wrote a 3000-word private message to a random person on Reddit on my last speed binge about something I could have easily said ten sentences about. That was when I was sitting for five hours on the toilet in the middle of the night – with the intention being to work on my novel. Can you imagine how insane this is?

If you are a male, you might also consider testosterone. I’ve had low T for many years although I’m only 23 and am on HRT (hormone replacement therapy) now for 11 months. I no longer feel depressed and my success in the gym is way better. Vyvanse was horrible for the gym because it simultaneously robbed me of all motivation to do physical work and suppressed my appetite. Things are better now.

For the sake of absolute honesty, I don’t get my testosterone from a doctor. It’s all high-quality underground stuff I have access to through a friend of mine who imports it to my country. This enables me to blast (go on a steroid cycle) whenever I want. So yes, I’m on steroids but it’s still better than speed and it helps tremendously in the withdrawals. Arnold is still alive. So is Ronnie Coleman. It goes without saying that they have abused the fuck out of AAS and much harsher compounds than test. But had they been speed addicts, I’m pretty sure they would be long gone…

This is all for now. I hope I’ve helped someone by sharing my addiction in depth. Stop speeding but do it for yourself. Speed is not your soulmate. And the pharmaceutical industry DOES NOT have your best interest in mind. It’s all about money for them. Doctors are unintentionally poisoning people with these ADHD drugs while the government schedules psychedelics as Class I controlled substances and hardly puts men on testosterone even though they’re 40 years old and clearly have low T. We don’t have to be victims of the system. We can set ourselves free. WE CAN STOP SPEEDING!

Blessed be everybody,

Golden Trinity

EDIT: I decided to get rid of my Tramadol and go cold turkey on that one as well. I’ve just been using it for 19 days so I know I won’t get withdrawals from it but it does mean that my Vyvanse withdrawals will be harder.

Afraid I will talk myself out of it before the appt. next week. 

First started in on speed when they put me on adderall in 4th or 5th grade.  Started abusing in college.  I'm 33 now and I've tried to quit several times over the past few years.  Longest I'll make it is about 6 months before throwing in the towel and re-upping.  I really thought I was going to kick it for good last year but I caved when things got crazy at work, as always.  I am *100% incapable* of taking this medicine as prescribed.  About to casually run out of a 30 day scrip I filled last week.  The only way is for me to not have an option to go running back to my doctor every time things get tough.

I'm afraid to quit.  I'm working 2 jobs right now, pulling 15 hour days 2-3x/week, and I am overloaded at both jobs. I can't take a week off to sleep all day and I can't just quit and find something less stressful--I'm starting out my career and I need this work to get fully licensed.  I could drop my part-time job but it's such an unbelievable opportunity and with the way things are right now I count myself lucky to even have one job.  Plus I really need the money.  I'm about 70k in the hole after grad school.  Without the stims I am going to struggle and make costly mistakes at work and there is no getting around it. I will be hard-pressed to focus on any hobbies.  I will be depressed as fuck for a while. I will have to accept that.  

That being said, the reasons to quit outweigh any of the negatives that come w/ PAWS and unchecked ADHD. As long as I stay on this bullshit I am missing out on time with my beautiful wife because I want to be alone when I get home. My health is at stake. I have no balls anymore when it comes to doing things I don't want to do. I'm not funny or fun to be around like I used to be. Plus I am hiding it from everyone; nobody knows but me.

This will sound crazy but the number one reason I want to quit is for my dog.  He gives me this look and I can tell...he KNOWS when I'm on this shit and he hates it. And every time I skip a walk to stay at home to be a degenerate is one less walk I'll have with him before he is gone.  That is something I cannot accept. 

Addiction is a crazy thing.  My main concern right now is that I will change my mind before I am scheduled to talk to my doctor--I couldn't get an appointment until next Thursday.  I told the receptionist I want to talk to the doctor about side effects but I'm thinking maybe I should call back and tell her the truth so she passes that message along before I talk myself into some new reason why I should quit some other time.

Sorry for the rant, this felt really good to type out though.  The shame is real.  I'd give a million dollars to have never been given a taste of this stuff to begin with.",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9988275170326233}"

I did it the first time cause I was drunk and I loved the fact that I felt like I didn't need sleep or food and also my sex drive went up. 

Now, I wanna quit cause last week I had a job interview and I felt like shit.

&#x200B;

**TL:DR ;  I've relapsed into my anorexia and I've been using stimulant binges as an ""escape"".. I'm a little lost..**

Sooo basically my situation is that I've been doing stims again.... Just like when I first started, I started with a single session that was somewhat responsible, but then it changed into a binge. Now I'm binging on stims once a month or something again...  I had a realization yesterday that my mindset has changed,  I don't really feel motivated to stay clean anymore. I mean I do want it ,but I just don't have the willpower and effort anymore.

This is because, since a few months or more ago, I've relapsed into my restrictive eating disorder (AN). I've been loosing weight and am pretty underweight currently,  luckily I manage to stop myself from going too far most of the time, and try to sustain my health but my weight is still slowly dropping (people notice and some start to worry, idk how long I can go on without reaching a point where I'd need medical attention, even though I'm trying to loose as little as possible). It's very painful because, just like with stims, this is my addiction. It makes me feel really good in a strange way, and whenever something happens that triggers me emotionally,  I turn to eating less and loosing weight. And just like with stimulants,  what gives me the most pain is the thought of having to worry the people close to me.

I really don't want to be and look sick, and worry them, or even end up in the hospital. But since I'm going through all this,  my mind tends to go to ""fuck it"". It's all the same shit over and over in my mind and I'm so tempted to use stims again just to escape it. I'm trying to replace my restrictive addiction with my stimulant addiction:  when I was most recovered from my ED,  I was also at my worst with irresponsible drug use.

I know it doesn't make any sense to replace one with the other, and it will harm me. But it seriously feels like it's impossible to stop both at the same time. On top of this, I'm so scared of asking for help because I've heard from other sufferers before that they won't let you into treatment if you're also an addict,  and if I just go to a rehab,  I'll relapse even harder into ED rituals which makes me afraid for myself. If I just go to ED treatment,  I'll have to quit everything cold turkey and I don't know if I can handle that mentally...

Anyway I don't even know if anyone can give any advice that would help, I just want to get this off of my chest and any encouraging words would be very appreciated. Just feeling a little hopeless and alone, I haven't been able to tell anyone yet because I can't let go over the control I have over my eating and body currently, I get anxious thinking about people knowing because I'll loose that control.",27,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9937438368797302}"

So I’m diagnosed with pretty bad ADHD (trust me I’m one hyperactive motherfucker when not on stimulants) as a kid. Been prescribed stims since I’d say 5th-6th grade. I’m a junior now. But I’d never take it daily for a very long period of time. During vacations, I’d get like a 1-2 month break from adderall. Same with the week ends. 

People say they don’t like adderall because it kills their personality. Well actually, thats what not having adhd is like. Calm, focused, motivated, etc. I actually love being on stims because I really don’t like it when I’m hyper and day dreaming constantly. I also like being motivated a lot. My personality remains.

Now adderall has kept its effectiveness pretty well over the years. But recently, I really don’t know and it’s kinda scary... here’s why, so whenever I’d take adderall (I’m doing online school) I’d WANT to do something productive, like let’s say I was watching YouTube in front of my laptop where I do my school work. Watching YouTube won’t be enjoyable. Because my brain knows that doing this certain task won’t give me that dopamine hit I’d usually get. But whenever I do school work, I’m enjoying it and getting shit done. 

Now this leads me to my next point. As of recently I have no idea why, but whenever I’m on adderall, I tend to want to get “cheap dopamine”. Basically the complete opposite of what I said in the previous paragraph. Like I’ll enjoy browsing Reddit over doing school work, and this kinda scares me because idk but that may have something to do with being addicted or something with my dopamine receptors. I’d like to also say I take 25mg XR.

This is what blows my mind and is kinda confusing? So I check the medicine cabinet, and I find some Vyvance. Like 10 30mg capsules. I say, why not fuck it. After all it’s a prodrug to adderall right? Metabolizes to adderall pretty much. Well you won’t believe what happened. I got a fuck load of shit done. AND it lasted wayyyy longer. Adderalls focus would be worn off at around 3-4pm but I’m still calm. This shit lasted till like 6pm. Like I wanted to get work done, and any distractions were non existent. I didn’t wanna get “cheap dopamine”. What’s funny is when I was talking to my doctor recently (this was when adderall wasn’t being dog shit) she asked me about Vyvance (I forgot to mention this but whenever I was a kid I tried Vyvance and it sort of killed my personality) I told her it gave me undesirable effects a long time ago. But now I’m kinda thinking of asking her about it because this shit works too good.

What’s also weird is, I was thinking of giving Dexedrine a shot, but idk if I wanna do that now, vyvance works very well for me. 

My question is, why is adderall making me wanna get cheap dopamine and not do my school work? (Forgot to mention this but most of the time I push myself to do my work ik it’s not good to depend on a med). And why does vyvance work so well even though their basically the same drug?

It's now flushed and the money wasted will be a painful reminder. The 13th of January marked day 0.

Preface to this - I maintain a strict supplement regime, of which includes NAC (N-acetyl-cysteine). **NAC also has another effect of supposedly reducing cravings and what I didn't realise is also stopping all the fun dopaminergic effects of the drug.** (In a study it blocked all amphetamine-triggered dopaminergic release and prevented the down-regulation of dopamine transporter).

So back to the story... I did what I would usually do and consumed the drug like I usually did.

Heart rate goes up, a nice tingle.... But no pleasure. I knew it was good, had seen the effects on others, but nothing on me.

I then did a stupid thing and took more, a lot more which led to a fun 8 hour effort to stay calm during a fairly significant OD.

It took a whole day of annoyingly awake researching to realise that **it was NAC that caused me not to get my intense euphoric high I craved and that it destroys all the good effects of meth**

And you know something?

It worked. My lingering positive connection I had with the drug is destroyed, I will reassess this in time.

I detest thinking about it and what I went through the last few days.

I'll keep taking NAC, and hopefully this experience will keep me away from meth.

I was like, “we going?” And he even asked if I wanted to get high first. After he promised not to a little while back. I luckily was both turned off and being careful of interaction with my medication, so it was a much easier “no” than it ever has been since I started using. I feel better about letting that shit go now. At least drawing a boundary that I don’t want to be around him when he’s using.

In interest of full disclosure, I picked up an opioid addiction a couple years after I quit stimulants. I'm currently in rehab tapering off suboxone, will finish my taper in a week and hop on vivitrol for relapse prevention. Opioids filled the place of speed in my soul, though I didn't realize until this year that they were related. Now I'm going full abstinence.

    This survey has been approved by the moderators.  

Hi everyone,

I am Melvin Goh, a PhD student from the University of Wollongong, Australia. My PhD research focuses on improving the health and well-being of people impacted by alcohol and other drugs via health risk communication.

I am conducting a study to survey people living in Australia and the United States of America (USA) about their alcohol and other drug use, health and well-being, health behaviours, and the impact of COVID-19 (UOW Ethics Approval No. 2019/183).

**What’s involved?**

You are invited to complete an anonymous online survey about your use of a range of substances, health and well-being, health behaviours, and COVID-19. The survey may take up to 20 minutes, although some people may complete it faster. Please be assured that your responses will be kept strictly ANONYMOUS as the survey does not ask of any personal identifiable details from you!

**To be eligible to participate, you will need to:**

* Be aged 18 and above living in Australia or the USA;
* Have had problems with illicit drugs or alcohol and/or have attended alcohol or other drugs (AOD) treatment in the past 12 months.

Please visit the following [link](https://uow.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_dm1oXM1GmqDEJQV) to participate or to get more information on the survey.

Eligible participants who complete the entire survey can enter a prize draw to win one of five $50 Amazon gift cards (currency based on location). I understand that a lucky draw for a gift card isn't the most attractive incentive, but I hope you can understand that it is the most I can get as a student. More importantly, it will help me with the PhD and achieve my aim of improving the health and well-being of people impacted by alcohol and/or other drugs.

If you have any questions, please let me know. Thank you to everyone who took the time to read my post and complete my survey :)",4,{'covid': 2},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9326913356781006}"

Terrible idea.  That beer turned into 7.  Then 3 hours later my connect is at my house dropping off a baggie. 

I binge for 3 days, then I went 3 months sober.  Rinse and repeat.  Consistently.

I always made it my goal to reach the 6th month mark again. And I am happy to say that I am now 6 months and 10 days sober.

When I hit the 6 month mark on December 22nd 2020, the craving took over my mind for 2 whole days.  I got depressed and the thought of using took over.  It came at me like a wave.  Fortunately, I didn’t cave in.  And 2 days later it went away.

I find it interesting that every 90 days this urge to use hits me like a wave.  I get depressed and irritable.  And then it goes away and I’m back to my normal sober self.

Has anyone else experienced this?  Will it ever go away?  I’m afraid one day I’ll cave in.  I have a good life.  Good income.  My own family.  I don’t want to throw that away.

I didn’t like this zombie feeling so tried switching to vyvanse, then strattera then modafinil and all of them weren’t as helpful as dex. At the end of the year I felt like I wanted to be free of having to rely on dex to do everything so tried to quit the meds and since then life has been a complete roller coaster. I was so exhausted so lethargic and tired and just gaming all day and eating. Fast forward 3 weeks and things feel that they haven’t improved, I tried taking dxm to supposedly lower tolerance and speed up withdrawal, found some of my modafinil for some days that were unbearable. I feel like the control I had over my life has shattered without the meds. On the one hand that makes me feel like I need them, on the other it makes me feel useless because I can’t enjoy or be proud of any of my successes on meds because they weren’t me and were just the drugs. I gave my mum the dex and asked her to give it back after 3 months to see if I can handle when my brain has gotten over dependence but today it was too much and I took my brothers (who also has adhd) vyvanse. Feel trapped between, I am adhd and I need meds to live a meaningful life and I am the way I am now because I have become used to dex. I never abused it only taking the daily dose prescribed but at times I would sometimes take sublingually or with tums to make it last longer. I know this is long but I need some advice from people. The adhd reddit is so pro meds they’ll justify taking like 100mg plus and ignore all possible negative long term side affects",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.999249279499054}"

- Moderate to Overwhelming anxiety especially when I'm out in public. 
- Psychosis (disturbing visuals and auditory hallucinations)
- Disgusting body odor
- Terrible nausea (sometimes) 
- Uncomfortable and intense sweating
- Decreased appetite. Eating is extremely difficult if not impossible. Food loses it's flavour, difficult to swallow food. Sometimes I cough up the food.
- Difficulties drinking water
- Uncontrollable shaking. It looks like I'm very nervous about something.
- Difficulties urinating even when I drink water.
- Word Salad and studdering issues (sometimes)
- constantly thinking about having unprotected sex while watching porn
- Shitty comedown, sometimes I cry due too very low dopamine receptors. I start having bad, weird and disturbing thoughts during this time.
- I lose myself and keep redosing and redosing
- mental issues that carried over to my sober thinking for example I constantly think people are talking about me when ppl are in fact minding there own business.

I’ve been buying the same amount every day while my life crumbles around me. That thought never even crossed my mind. I’m so glad I came to this on my own and no one had to tell me, regardless of how long it took me to get there.

I started drinking and smoking herbs when I was 12. Thats just what we did in the town I grew up in. I started getting into trouble then. Ungovernability is what they called it. In reality I wouldn't listen to my newly divorced mom and was sent to group homes and then to the juvenile detention facility in my home state. I was supposed to be there for 30 days. I bucked all authority and they ended up keeping me there for 6 months. That being the maximum time they could keep me for misdemeanors. I was released and returned to my moms. She didn't want me and I didn't want to be there so I was sent to my dads. He was a buddy at best. Never a father figure.  I spent my high-school years smoking/drinking and bouncing from school to school and parent to parent. I stayed out of trouble ( didn't get caught), dropped out of h.s. and got my g.e.d.. it was simple as I am intelligent and well read. I enrolled in college when I was 18. Scheduled my classed around ""wasted wensday"" and the other parties that come with college if thats what your there for. During this time I was also stealing checks, creating fake checks with other peoples routing numbers, and spending mad amounts of other people's money. After 3 semesters of this I was busted. At 19 I received 3 ten year sentences run concurrently. I went to the state penitentiary and received parole after 3 years. Kept drinking and smoking herb and using other people's piss to pass my ua's. Met a girl and ""fell in love"". Introduced to meth and jumped all in. Wasnt out long before my parole was revoked. During the time I was out I picked up a new Federal offense of destruction of an air navigation system. I vandalized a v.o.r. in the woods on the top of a mountain.  I went back to prison to finish my 10 plus another 21 months Federal. During this time I was getting day for day good time which I got 6 months revoked. I ended up discharging my state time after 5 years and 6 months and going to a Federal prison for my 21 month sentence.  I got out of prison in 2002. Smoked weed every day all day.Did my 3 years supervised release buying piss clean drinks every week and smoking constantly.  Had my daughter in 05 and my son in 07. Got my B.A. in broadcast journalism and got a job as a local reporter. Had my green card, got pulled over for speeding in the news rig, had a 11 year old warrant, went to jail and was fired for the oz of herb in my company car. Got a couple editing jobs and landed my dream job. Was a camera man for an award winning Discovery Channel show. Traveled all over. Smoking and drinking like a rock star. Company AMEX. Met the woman of my dreams. Got fired for losing some footage. It wrecked me. Destroyed any self esteem I had. I bounced from one shitty labor job to the next. Spent the next 8 years hiding from my life. Staying stoned, drunk and miserable. Knowing that I did not deserve the love I was getting from the woman I was with. Got prescribed adderall and xanax. Got reacquainted with meth and smoked herb all day every day. I love her and her daughter. Our kids grew up together and they are brother and sisters. 
She left me in November.  I didn't see it coming at all. Told myself I was going to change. Quit the addies,xanys,meth and gambling.  Held onto the herbies with a dead man's grip. Found NA and a great group of people. Relapsed one night with meth. The next day I made the choice to quit. Everything.  I've been clean exactly 21 days. I have so many emotions right now. I am so very sad. I just went to see my dad and he didn't know me or my kids. It will be the last time I see him. I miss my ex so much it hurts. I am so sorry to her. I'm sorry I brought her with me on this o so shitty ride. And ya, fuck 2020 and covid. 
But I am thankful. I don't think I would have gotten clean without this pain. I needed it. I don't want it and I wish it would go away... but I am thankful for it. For the opportunity that I have right now to become the best me that I can be. I've jumped into NA with the same gusto that I jumped into dope. Have a sponsor and am working my first step. One minute at a time trying to become someone who I'm proud of. 
My life is shitty right now. I'm unemployed. About to be homeless. But I keep showing myself that I can do something I never thought possible. If I can stay clean through all this shit I can do anything.  Its going to take time. I have alot of problems I've ignored and let compound. But I so so so want to be a man that I am proud to be. Everything else will come with that.

I also need advice,"My ex is in active addiction to alcohol and meth. We were together for 8 years. I found out that he’s been addicted to meth since October 2018. His alcoholism got worse around that time too. I stayed in the relationship with the “promise” that he would quit, go to rehab, meetings, etc. Obviously, it didn’t work out since he was still using despite being in outpatient rehab and attending meetings, so I broke it off last year. He then moved back in with his mom.

Well 2021 is here, and we are still in contact. He is continuing drinking during the day/evening and using meth. He says he feels extremely alone, depressed, anxious, unwanted, unloved, judged by everyone, etc. But he doesn’t see (or in denial) about his addictions being the main cause of his feelings and problems in life.

We met yesterday, he said that he still loved me, that he missed me so much and wanted to move back in because the area he’s at now is extremely triggering. We hugged, and I told him that I NEEDED to see real change. He agreed and told me “this time it’ll be different”. Well this morning he woke up angry, saying that everything is my fault, I made him miserable, I make him feel unloved and unwanted. 

These mood swings are crazy!! Like night and day! He’s also gets mad very easily now. And he slept for 12 hours last night. Also, he would literally pass out mid sentence (would be snoring in seconds) then wake up in a panic a few seconds later not remembering what happened. That happened multiple times last night and it’s very concerning. 

My questions are:
How difficult is it to quit meth? 
Are these mood swings permanent?
Was he coming off meth or was it actual withdrawal?

Honestly I haven’t had many cravings in these 4 months but I’ve had a few dreams where I am picking up or on them. It’s amazing because I didn’t think I’d be able to continue pursuing my hobbies as I was taking adderall to further myself, notably in music production and also playing video games. When I was using I just felt so amazing doing those things but when I quit it took some time to fully dive back in. 

I am so beyond grateful that today I am sober (minus smoking a fuck ton of weed), and that I am still growing and motivated to continue pursuing my hobbies. I was so scared the only reason I was making music was because I was high. I now know that is not the case. I genuinely love doing it. 

In addition to quitting adderall, I quit a 5+ year long addiction to benzos, which I abused every time I came down from adderall, so daily, I quit my other Vice which I won’t mention but was so costly financially and emotionally as I was being a bad person to my s/o and I also quit gambling going on 2 months this weekend. 

A lot to be grateful for in these dark days. Wishing everyone a great week and all of the best moving forward in whatever battle you are facing!",61,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8331424593925476}"

This was never fun, not even the first time. This is the most devilish drug i have taken and i will never touch any substance after that. Got introduced to Amphetamine sulfate 2 years ago at the age of 16. While using between the years and not finishing school because i was doing speed with the 'homies'. I was starting to lose faith in myself. Got a Job at the start of 2020 with the help of my best friend. Now it's the 5th January 2021, after falling back into the drug at the start of november, things were still not all that bad,until i got 7 grams of some very good speed from my 'Friend'. now im sitting here after doing 3 days of no sleep, only to start up on the next day again and blacking out twice, ONE IN A BATHTUB, where my mother, which was kind enough to look after me because i was away too long, found me sleeping in. Apparently i jumped out screaming before i laid down on my bed, while telling her to fuck off and get fucking lost all the time.

Right now the only thing that i have in mind is suicide.

I have scarred my mother for life all because i wanted to be faster.

I'm probably not gonna kill myself, because i dont have the balls. But i'm hoping that the amphetamine gives me the last little push to go through with it. 

I don't think i deserve to live, nor still living here.

I've been awake for 25 hours and my eyes are just so dry, no amount of water or eye drops are helping either. I took another 160mgs last night even though I said I would stop at 100 this time for sure. And I think I'm finally ready to accept that I really do have a problem.

I don't use every day, its more like once every 3 days, and I'm thankful not to be an every day user but I'm not actually living life. I just look foward to getting high every 3 days.

I haven't hit rock bottom, in fact I'm doing fine. At least thats the face I put on for everyone anyway. I talk to all my friends on discord constantly, I have a steady job and I'm going to college. But nobody knows, not a single person knows just how high I am all the time. One of the worst aspects of being addicted to a stimulant is how lonely it is. I feel like I'm living a lie, I've kept such a massive part of my life now from everyone I know and it feels awful. 

I guess it's been this way for 4 years? I can't remember exactly when I got my prescription but I think I was 19, I'm 23 now. I can remember multiple birthdays of mine now when I didn't want to be with my family. I just wanted to get high and be alone in my room playing games or browsing the internet, and it makes me sick to my stomach just thinking about it.

The worst part is I don't even have anything to show for it. All I did was play games for hours and hours and thats it. I feel like I've wasted away my early 20s doing nothing and taking way longer in school than I should have. 

I know without adderall I still will have ADHD and it will be difficult to do normal every day tasks but I'll take that over being emotionally tied to a fucking pill. I'm just so tired of thinking about adderall all the time and I want to be done with it.

And so this is it, I don't have the will power to take adderall responsibly so I'm not picking up my next months script. I don't even have the will to get rid of what I already have. But I took a 6 month break a year back by just not picking up the script before, so I think I'll just make that permanent this time.

I'm sorry for the long rant post but thank you to anyone who reads it. I just needed to get this off my chest and out there somewhere.

 I would be lying if I said I wasn't scared about losing interest in the things I enjoy for a while. I know enjoyment and motivation comes back but like I said I took a 6 month break and a lot of that was spent being incredibly depressed and bored until the last month or so.

I start writing this long ass post about how I’ve lost everything and I’m stuck in this horrible situation that I can’t escape. That I’m doomed to die a junkie. Then, for literally the first time in weeks, it hits me. Hey maybe if you quit smoking meth some of those problems will clear up. I understand it’s easier said than done. But I haven’t even tried. I’ve been buying the same amount every day while my life crumbles around me. That thought never even crossed my mind. I’m so glad I came to this on my own and no one had to tell me, regardless of how long it took me to get there. Anyways, I’m not saying I’m cured of my addiction and withdrawals are gonna be joke time. I just spent hours today in absolute despair not knowing what to do next. So that’s the plan.

Yesterday my mom was diagnosed with cancer... Safe to say I don't think I handled it too well... She had a bad reaction to some medicine she was prescribed to take the day before going in for a checkup due to intense stomach aces. After swellings, non stop pains and throwing up etc, my dad drove her to the hospital and after she updated me via text, letting me know she was feeling better after getting some pain meds. I remember thinking how I wanted to go through the same thing on hopes of getting a morphine prescription. A couple hours later and an x-ray they found a tumor growing inside her appendix. I couldn't even look my dad in the eyes as he told me, scared my now giant pupils would be obvious.

 I've never been good with emotions, I'm generally pretty cold, not caring enough to let things get to me and spark any emotions. On top of this I have a really hard time identifying what I'm feeling, not knowing if I'm happy or sad in certain situations. But when did I become so heartless?! I spend a fair amount of time helping my friends, being a shoulder to cry on and someone who listens, but really I'm just seeing if I could give a fuck, I just act like I care whilst regretting getting myself into my current situation. Only thing to ever spark a reaction out of me was when talking to a close friend about her brother's suicide one year after he shot himself. She showed me a picture of him and it was the first time I saw what he looked like, suddenly I feel some tears flowing down my face, despite not feeling anything particularly. 

But even when being informed the stomach aces my mom has been complaining about for years turns out was caused by a tumors I couldn't give an emotion, except some shock and disbelief upon being informed. I've lived an incredibly normal life with incredibly normal realities, no alcoholics, no traumatic experiences, no addicts (except yours truly of course). No one in my family knows about my addiction but I can't help feeling like the fuck up, the black sheep set on a path of self distruction, with no reason for my behaviour, no trauma or something to suppress or bring out. Quickly after I started doing drugs I stopped seeing a future for myself, I always assumed I'd just go down as a background character who met with an early death, either to drugs, suicide or cancer from smoking cigarettes daily. I should've gotten that tumor instead of her. 

If my first thought was how jealous I was that my mom got pain meds after she checked into the hospital then wouldn't it been better if I were the one dying in the hospital whilst getting pumped with drugs and not an innocent women. I cant even muster up a real feeling, I don't even know what I should feel. Angry? That she is getting punished for things I've done. Sad? My own mother who raised me and giving unconditional love despite me doing nothing but lie to her face in return, could be on her death bed. Calm? Logically there's no need to get worked up over something you can't do anything about. 

I disgusts myself, prioritising drugs over checking in on my mom after getting hospitalised. Without a second thought start looking for answers in amphetamine and then not being able to look my own father in the eyes. Last time seeing her I was high and have a hard time remembering that whole day, and due to being high I have tenancies to be rude and abrubt along with avoiding eye contact as much as possible. Maybe it's my brain that's broken, I wonder what combination of drugs would fix it? Does it really have to take my own mom dying for me to feel anything? Or would I even care? Why do amphs console me better then my own family? 

:TL:DR mom got diagnosed with cancer and I don't know what the fuck to do so I just end up doing drugs and blaming myself

i am not diagnosed with ADHD and i'm certain i do not have it. that's not what made me reach for adderall, anyways. it started the way it always does; my friend offering to get me some adderall to help with school. it worked and i was in literal disbelief at how much more i could get done on adderall. the first time was literally life changing lol. i'm not very experienced with drugs but even so, i was certain it couldn't get better than adderall.

after the first time, i'd get myself some more every couple of months or so when i needed to catch up in school. the first several times were fine, and the crashes were still manageable. it initially started with getting five 20mg IR and i'd take one a day for five days straight with no problem, barely any withdrawal symptoms. with every ""binge"" i'd find myself tempted to take more and more. the third time around i was buying about 8 adderalls, and taking two a day for four days straight.

obviously this trend continued and i found that the breaks between these 5-day-long periods on adderall were getting shorter. currently i take anywhere from 60mg-80mg daily for several days straight and this happens about every month. i've experimented with different types of adderall, both IR and XR, and i pretty much am aware of what works best for me, or so i thought at least.

i don't constantly have access to adderall, therefore when the opportunity presents itself, i can't stop myself from buying some. the other day i decided to do so again, and after last night's terrible crash i think i'm starting to realize i have a problem. i came on here seeking answers about whether or not i was addicted. the fact that i manage to take several week breaks in between convinced me that i couldn't possibly be addicted. after having read a post about someone in an identical situation (who openly called it an addiction), i'm starting to think otherwise.

i've stopped being productive on adderall. i find myself promising that i'm going to do something school related, and then spending three hours on the internet instead. the crashes are absolutely horrible, and only getting worse, and yet regardless i find myself desperately craving adderall every month or so. i'm tired of sleepless nights staying up 48 hours straight due to insomnia, or eating a total of about 200 calories during the entirety of the five days, or convincing myself that i am literally about to have a stroke due to my suddenly numb arm and all of the other reasons combined.

i'm not sure if i'm addicted, and that's what i came here to figure out. i am MUCH too young to be struggling with drug addiction. i guess what i'm here for is to ask for advice. i do not have the option of reaching out to my doctor as my parents wouldn't take the news very well. i read online that it's not in my best interest to just go ""cold turkey"" but i'm not sure what other options i have. how do i manage the cravings? and the withdrawal symptoms? how do i make myself feel productive without it again? what are some of the most compelling reasons for me to WANT to stop?

I ask, how can I be joyous while knowing the hell that awaits me? 🤒
I ask, why doesn’t the LETHAL “Limitless Pill” provide sustainable superpowers the likes of water and nutritious food?
I ask, why is not LSD legal and prescribed by doctors? It saved my life once. The legal Vyvanse almost ruined it a million times. LSD will save me once more when the satan’s substances are out of my system.

Severe speed addiction (and benzo addiction as a result)... I wish I never tried Vyvanse. But I will forever love it with love the likes of that which Noah had for Allie... 💔 It is time slow down the romance and find something non-chemical to fall for; find something realistic to strive for career-wise. It’s fine to achive greatness but at the cost of one’s very ability to enjoy the fruits of their efforts once they’re there...? Probably not. I want to be a King. I am a King on amphetamine. But I want to build a Kingdom based on sobriety and one I may thrive in into old age with undamaged organs and an uninflated ego.

Can we really do this? Me and....... well me and me. Goodbye Vyvanse. 

Coming off of a 320 mg Vyvanse binge by sleeping 9 peaceful hours and then taking 7,5 mg of Clonazepam just to be able to sleep a bit more and kind of for the heck of it AND then also for experimental purposes exclusively dropping 90 ug of superior quality liquid LSD on top of the benzos before napping and then waking up a few hours later to start the final binge with 3x 70 Vyvanse at once (powder taken out of the capsules before ingestion purely to enjoy the taste of lisdexamphetamine) and going about your last Monday work-alcoholic-like productivity routine is one HELL of a way to bid a soulmate substance adieu. But wait... since tis is my last binge before going into treatment and there is an abundant supply of Vyvanse and Clonazepam in my drawer... maybe we will accomplish something even more extraordinary together before our immiment break-up. My soulmate substance, I thank you for all the good you have done for me and I forgive you for all the awful you have inflicted upon me and my loved ones and innocent people as well. R.I.P. Vyvanse. Btw, I’m 22,5 y/o male. 80 kg/176 lbs. 186 cm/6’1”. Been 14 months since I tried any drug besides alcohol and nicotine - both of which interest me not at all. 

TLDR; DO NOT GET AN ADHD DIAGNOSIS UNLESS YOU TRULY HAVE THE WILLPOWER OF A BUDDIAT MUNK AND THE ABILITY TO REFRAIN FROM INSURANCE-COVERED DOPEAMINE IN ABUNDANSE THAT WILL BE YOUR DEMISE WHILE YOU EXPERIENCE THE DEADLY DELIGHT THAT LEADS TO EARLY DEATH OR SEVERLY DAMAGED HEALTH... IF YOU ARE AN ADDICT LIKE ME PLEASE JOIN ME ON THE MISSION OF STAYING ALIVE. HIGH OR NOT. LET’S DO THIS TOGETHER AND ACTUALLY RESPECT THE BODIES WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN AND LIVE A LIFE FULL OF JOY AND NATURAL DOPAMINE...❤️

I send all struggling speed addicts my blessings. And also to each and every individual out there chained by chemicals to a varying degree - I send my blessings. I ask for nothing in return. But I do ask the Higher Power to allow me to survive my last binge (which thing is very likely) and muuuuchhhh more importantly make it so that this be truly my LAST one 🙏🏻.

2021-01-03 02:42:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/kpggb0/need_to_quit_adderall_for_good/,Need to quit Adderall for good," I have to quit Adderall. No one in my family or friends know I take it cause it’s my dirty little secret. I’m on a 20mg XR prescription but some days (most days) I take around 30-40 mg. Then I go on a 1 - 2 week break (because I’m out of it or I’ve flushed it down the toilet) before picking up my prescription at the pharmacy yet again. 

I know that it’s bad for me. That salty dry mouth taste is unbearable and the constant bathroom breaks suck. I literally get diarrhea every single time I take it. It makes isolated (barely talk to my friends/family), it zaps all creativity from me (music, arts, stuff I liked). It traps me inside my brain, makes me focus on really tedious things that aren’t efficient. It keeps me up at night and as I’m unable to go to sleep, I’ve been downing nyquil almost every night for it to help (which apparently is bad for you liver?-yikes). I’m real dumb about it, it can be 8 pm and just to get through a bit of work I’ll pop some addy even if it means I’ll have a shit night. 

Additionally, and this is what really makes me feel like a piece of shit: I have a chronic pain issue which gets INFINITELY worse with adderall. My legs cramp up constantly and my back and my hips get abnormally tight. If I cared at all about my body, I’d quit right away.

But fuck me the rush is amazing. Life is so boring and I don’t understand how most people are able to work their 9-5 jobs without being on something. I like feeling excited about work in the morning, I LOVE feeling productive, I like being an asset to my firm. But in the end, after all the rush is gone, and you’re driving home alone (or sitting at home alone as I’ve been since March), it leaves me again with the painful realization that I have nothing in my life. That I didn’t really talk to any of my coworkers during the day cause I was in a blaze of addy when they came by my desk, that I didn't get any texts from anyone the entire day, and if it’s a Friday, that I have no plans for the weekend and no one to hang out with.

I know I will be happier off it. When I’m surrounded by friends and family I don’t feel the need to be on it. I know I’m better without it but for some reason I can’t do it. It’s a fucking decision to be made. It makes no sense how this is a struggle for me or for any of us. Say what you will about addictions but I do think at the end of the day it’s a decision you have to make. I just don’t understand what it takes for my brain to make the right decision. 

I’ve been on it for 6 years (started at 24, 31 now) but I took about a 10 month break 3 years ago cause I was off work (so I KNOW it can be done). Not only that, I’ve taken 1-3 week breaks a few times this past year (like maybe 5-6 times) so I’m pretty sure that if I quit cold turkey it won’t be that bad (the first week break I took back in April was the big one and none of my other weeks have been that bad). 

I’m never sure if I’m addicted or just bored with a substance abuse problem but here I am at 2:30 am writing my story on “stopspeeding” so I guess it’s the former.

Also I am very sorry for my naivety.) But basically from the title, my younger sister is going to rehab for both a drug and alcohol addiction with her drug addiction mostly focusing on meth. She luckily never got in trouble with it, and she decided to check herself in and the state is able to pay for it, which we are all so proud of her for doing. The reason I’m posting this is for advice on what you guys would’ve liked to hear after you quit. I am completely new to all of this and have no experience with it myself so I am confused by everything. I never had any clue she was using because the most I had seen was just marijuana use, but how does someone get to this point? I just want to try and understand her and her mindset and see if I can be any help to her through this very difficult process or if I should leave her be. If anyone has any advice or comments, please comment. Thank you for reading and I honestly do appreciate it.",6,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9936951994895935}"
