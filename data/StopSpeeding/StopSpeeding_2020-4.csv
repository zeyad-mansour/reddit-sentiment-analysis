2020-04-28 14:57:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/g9t5q6/paranoia/,Paranoia,"In an attempt to quit, and stay quit, each day I am going to try to write about a particular aspect of my journey with amphetamine addiction. My hope is that with each segment, I will force myself to confront the horrors to which we all know or have known at some point. Today, I would like to talk about my own experience with drug-induced paranoia. 

During one night of my habitual bullshit, which included copious amounts of adderall and vyvanse, no sleep, no food, lots and lots of nicotine and porn, I turned to this subreddit and read something that resonated with me on a deep level. The comment had read something along the lines of: “I spend most of my time using thinking and researching how to get off this drug lol”. I had never agreed with any statement more in my life. The flip side of that statement was also true. I spent most of my time off the drug fantasizing about being on it. 

This oxymoron is perhaps the epitome of addict psychology. All of us struggle with our chemically-drained brain romanticizing speed, and its effects. For me, any benefits are rapidly diminishing, at best, and have been for quite awhile. The truth is, I know exactly what is gonna happen when I pop those pills. 

At the peak of my use, I lived in a constant state of pure terror. It goes so much deeper than paranoia. Quite literally, these pills drove me to insanity. Back when I was at school, let's just say I had a very dysfunctional routine. My morning always, no matter what, consisted of popping say 100 mg of adderall. I would go to the library, and try to concoct a list of things to do for that day. When I first got into adderall, there was nothing I like to do more than knock out a week's worth of school work in a day. It made me feel invincible. Speaking of paranoia, at the beginning of the semester, I skipped all of my classes because I was on ridiculous amounts of stimulants and I was terrified of being like that surrounded by 50 people and a professor. After I missed that first week, It was game over. I convinced myself that had I showed up in that class, everyone would fixate on me for not being there the first week, and then notice that I was tweaking, so I couldn’t show my face. I kid you not, I did not show up for a single class for an entire year. You’re probably wondering how this flew with my parents right about now. I went to astonishing lengths in order to keep my secret life going. Every single second of every day, I was worrying about when they were going to find out and force me to come home. Things had already been bad before that year, so my parents required that I call them pretty much daily. My life had become the ultimate antithesis of what I projected to others. Everything I did completely centered around making sure my image was upheld. As a greater distance arose between my external image and internal state, paranoia took over my life. In both physical and mental ways, I became consumed by it. To keep the ruse up for my parents, I would literally write entire essays to send to them that I never handed in. I would go into my grades on google chrome and change the code of the website to project higher grades. You see, in the beginning, I had so many opportunities to go to someone, anyone, for help. Instead, I grew so paranoid that even after missing only one class, or telling one lie, it was too much for me to deal with. I knew that things were headed to my never being allowed back at that institution at the end of the school year, and the idea of explaining this to my friends caused me stark horror. I had no interest in helping myself, even stopped caring about the pain I was causing to my family, all I wanted to do was pretend like things were normal, and that I was okay inside. Everytime I consumed stimulants, It made me that much more aware of where I was headed. Ultimately, that was to a deep pit, the likes of which I still probably haven’t fully comprehended. Paranoia is vicious, it entraps you in a web of false reality, it builds mountains out of moles, and it will eat you alive. In the worst of it, I lived in a state of terror, crippling anxiety, stress, and psychosis. I could barely even walk through campus anymore, out of fear of everyone else’s gaze, just that was enough to make me retreat. This quickly got overbearing, so I did the only sensible thing in a situation like that, I started drinking daily, even during the day, to calm myself down. The funny thing is that adhd meds are supposed to help you sit still, but by that point I couldn’t keep myself in the same position on a couch, or a table, for more than a few minutes. I became hyper self-aware of all my newfound tics, and body movements. At one point, I couldn’t even be in the same study room as any of my friends without getting up to leave every 10 minutes. So I would make up some narrative like I had class, killing two birds with one stone, and I would go find a new room to occupy by my lonesome. If that didn’t exist because it was a busy day, I would go home. I lived in a fraternity house with 16 other dudes throughout the duration of this. In other words, there was no escape ever. No peaceful room I could go lock because I had a roommate. No moment of the day where everyone home wasn’t seated on our family room couch watching some show and bantering. This was a ruthless place. Each time you sat down you had a pretty significant chance of getting roasted for one thing or another. This did nothing to help my anxiety about coming home for the day. Back to the routine, so in the morning I would go to the library, and basically stay for as long as I could handle the paranoia. Generally speaking, this wasn’t very long. Oftentimes I would lock myself into a study room, and start hearing voices talking outside, as if someone was going to barge in and arrest me or they knew I was tweaking. It would, without fail, become too much to handle at some point. I would look down at what I was supposed to be doing, and immediately look back up to the door, trying to hone my hearing in on what was going on, whether someone was about to come in. This cycle repeated itself until I inevitably gave up. It was a special kind of hell. In preparing to go home, usually a little after lunch time, I would have to stop at the liquor store. This was always the worst. I drove a bright red car that you could make from a mile away, I was always so terrified of being spotted in the middle of the day walking back to my car, with a bottle of vodka or tequila. After that I would grab some diet cokes or sprites and pour some of the vodka into a bottle of soda. I would then drive around campus, past many police cars I might add, sipping that drink until life became a little more tolerable. I would have to find some time to lie to my parents about my activities for that day, and most days I would put it off as long as I could. More recently, I went back through texts with my dad where it was me going “I’ll call you in an hour” at 10 am, then at 10, saying after lunch, then saying before dinner, etc. I was deathly afraid of that daily phone call, it was one the most real reminders of what I was doing with my life and the consequences it had. I simply could not do anything at the time. I’m not exaggerating at all. Even returning a text felt too overbearing. There were several times I missed flights home because I just didn’t go to the airport, like the time I skipped Easter with my family including grandpa who shortly after passed. I was so afraid of everything, I ran as far away as I knew how. Retreating to booze, xanax, and weed. It's genuinely a miracle I made it home to get help, I still remember what was going through my head. My parents were considering having me drive back to Florida, so that they wouldn’t have to pay for shipping the car or one of them to go up and get it. I had already planned on drinking that entire 20 hour drive, through NY City even. I would not have made it. Yet in my paranoia, that was better than facing what was waiting for me. They decided to have my fly home, and left explicit instructions to park the car at a long-term facility that my dad’s work had a discount with. I instead drove to the airport drunk, and parked in the short term lot at the airport, and still barely made it on time. The car was an absolute mess, throwing up everywhere, bottles of vodka and rotted food on the seats. Not to mention the fact that my leaving the car there cost my parents an extra thousand and my dad had to go get it a few days after I got back, the car didn’t even have working windshield wipers. I was supposed to get them fixed weeks ago, but couldn’t put up with the idea of sitting at the shop while it was getting done. Even at home, in my recent missteps, the paranoia has made a full fledged return. During this quarantine, I will be in my room at night, waiting for my family to go to sleep before I can go crazy with porn and nicotine, and that moment seemingly never comes. It has gotten to the point where I can’t even look at my phone out of this fear of my parents laying awake trying to fake me out and expose my entire plan. This has never once happened, never in four years has she come into my room after probably 10:30 p.m., but that doesn’t stop my head from assuming it's gonna happen at any moment. I am left lying there, wide awake doing nothing but thinking. Concurrently, I hear her voice or the hardwood floors squeak every minute. I literally jump every time too. My love-hate affair with amphetamines has been plagued by a never ending cycle of terror, anxiety, hallucinations, and psychosis. Almost immediately after I feel the effects coming on, I immediately regret the decision.

I've made a lot of progress in other ways (especially diet and exercise and also making more friends with fellows and going to a lot of 12 steps meetings) in recovery but it's frustrating that the underlying issues that prompted me to start using adderall and ultimately abuse it are psyching me out so bad (reading, writing, more ""Administrative"" work, etc.). 

I'm not even at 4 months off it and having abused adderall for almost ten years nearly every day, I know it's way to early even to entertain the idea of ""using it in moderation"" again, because my brain still needs more time to heal.

Gave myself away to someone who claimed they went through the same things than I am going through.,"Me & my ex broke up 9 years ago because he cheated on me with one of my friends from high school after a big fight we had.  Last year in November I messaged him about my addiction and how I haven't felt like myself since me & him knew each other. I've been on Adderall since my freshman year of college, and that was the year my step-mom gave me one of her pills and after that I got my own prescription and went on my way to get addicted to it a few years later (junior year of college). Been addicted to it since then. I feel like a prisoner in my own life because without it I am depressed, useless, and feel like my life will never get better due to my fucked up brain where I am not motivated to do a damn thing at the ripe age of 26. 

Anyways, after trying to convince myself to quit on my own, I decided to contact my ex that I felt like knew me better than anyone else (we dated for about 4 years before he cheated). Told him things that I haven't even told my best friend. He went through his own phase of addiction, so he says. He was addicted to spice & has always been smoking a shit ton of weed since I've known him. 

He always told me that our relationship was the one thing he regretted in his entire life. Even tried to kill himself at one point not too long after he was out of my life.  Fed me lies about how he felt about me and I truly believed that he felt genuine feelings for me. So I told him my deepest darkest thoughts about how I really felt about my addiction. Let him back into my life because I felt like it was right and I felt good about trying to get better with him around.

Now I'm left here worse off then I was before I let him back in. Told me that these pills ruined me. And that I am needy and will always be lonely. Obviously I am going through a rough time trying to end this horrible addiction that I think drives my life sometimes. Makes me feel useless when I'm without them. 

I just can't believe I've done this to myself. I knew I wanted to get better & I truly thought that, since he had been through similar things (so he says) that things would be okay and that I could be able to finally see myself being happy after I've gotten through the hardest part.

2020-04-22 09:15:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/g60wjl/i_relapsed/,I relapsed.,"So, I have a lot to say that you may have heard before. Hell, you may be able to relate to it in some way. I'll try not to go overboard, but I just need a release...

For starters, let me give you a little backstory:

I had used some form of substance since I was 17 years old. Not bad considering a majority of people I know that use now or have in the past started using drugs or alcohol years before they were 17... I digress.

I started the typical drinking and smoking at age 17, smoked a shit ton of tobacco, a shit ton of pot and i dabbed for a while... I took advantage of a golden opportunity to attend university and dropped out after my first year, met a drug dealer that I fell head over heels in love with, and that's when I began experimenting with other drugs. I tried psychedelics, pills, an assortment of uppers and downers... then I met that evil bitch Tina. 

My boyfriend had no problem coaching me through my first time doing meth, but was adamant about never allowing me to do it again. He was the type to always be able to go on a bender and drop it like it was nothing. 
We had a chaotic relationship given that I was only 18 and still in that reckless, stubborn phase .. After a few abusive arguments, I called up my mom (the one person I can count on whenever shit gets rough) and I left. I left and I walked straight into the arms of the drug I felt would comfort me.

Fast forward two and a half years later to when I found my rock bottom. I had gotten myself into some hard fucking times, all to chase a high I'd never get again... I'd sold my body. I sold drugs. I stole from people and surrounded myself with criminals that I had no business being around. I escaped being sold to a sex trafficking ring by the skin of my teeth. I had become homeless and bounced from trap house to trap house until I just... woke up one day. I really don't know how to explain it, but there was a day when the drugs weren't getting me high, the company I kept had suddenly started disgusting me and I was finally fed up with the bullshit.

By the grace of my amazing family, I flew out to Wisconsin (I'm from California, but my family moved to Wisconsin and I stayed behind and chose ""the lifestyle.""), spent the first couple weeks in a daze; I ate, slept... woke up, cried hysterically, ate some more and slept a LOT more, and on February 1st of 2016, I began my year long journey to rehabilitation.  I attended inpatient rehab until March of 2017, and I was feeling like a brand new person, as most do for a while...

That feeling lasted for a while until I found myself becoming bored with life as it should be... I had found a decent paying job that consumed a lot of my life, and I fucking hated it. I had a decent relationship, but I was putting more effort into it than was fair and I ended up hating that too. I had fallen into a deep depression and had reintroduced myself to alcohol, and that's when I slowly crept back into bad habits that I thought were dead and gone.

I was pouring everything I had into a job and relationship that gave me little in return and I was so unhappy. I became so tired of what I was doing that I allowed myself an excuse to drown myself in liquor, thinking that it would ease my pain enough to keep holding on until things ""got better."" One DUI later and I had slowed my roll a bit, but only for a short while. Eventually, instead of drinking at bars, I took my vice home and drank alone. 

I had a few too many one night and woke up still drunk, sick but not as sick as I was going to be the next day. I endured the dreaded two day hangover and went to work feeling okay, but something was off. This behavior added to my already traumatic past triggered the most severe anxiety I had ever experienced in my life. My family has a history of clinical anxiety and depression, and I had begun to feel the anxiety when I was in rehab, but nothing compared to the constant state of panic I had found myself in after that heavy binge drinking episode. I had become so riddled with anxiety that I was having severe panic attacks more than once daily (at least), and I had so much trouble getting out of bed let alone going to work. 

I filed for FMLA to cover absence from work until I got my mental health squared away, but they only allowed me four days of excused absence a MONTH. Given that I was adjusting to trial runs of different medication that made my condition worse for a while and also given that I was continuing to have daily episodes that were holding me back from performing the way management wanted, I lost my job after two years of commitment to the shitshow of a place. Albeit, I wasn't too disappointed as I know that I did all I could and that management was a fucking joke from the start. 

I had found a new job a couple months later once I found the right medication to help ease my panic disorder, and I fucking loved it. I am currently employed at this place and continue to enjoy every day I get to go to work (which has never happened to me before)... I had left the relationship that was dragging me down, and finally felt like I could move forward and get my mental wellbeing back into shape.

Almost a year into working, I had gotten back into touch with my ex (the one I had first used dope with), and it took me by surprise. I was skeptical at first, but we spoke for a while and somehow the spark between us reignited, he moved to WI and we moved back in together. 

Things turned sour once I realized he never changed, and he realized I had changed more than he anticipated. We have broken up and reunited a few times now and he still insists on trying again, but I'm not sure I want to dive into the same of cycle of toxicity all over again.

What does aaaall this have to do with r/StopSpeeding , you might ask? Well... 

I made a choice recently after having my last blow up argument with my ex and temporarily losing my job due to COVID-19... I had spent the first week enjoying school break, and usually I would've had a few beers and smoked a little weed to cap off the night... One night, out of sheer stupidity and lack of reasonable consideration, I ended up getting a small amount of
dope. I racked up a line (i used to smoke, but I felt more in control by racking up), took it to the face and got spun for the first time in 4 years. 

It surely did what it's known for. I had energy that I forgot was attainable. I was able to focus on things that I haven't found interesting in such a long time (like painting, drawing, writing, etc.) and was even motivated to do my schoolwork (I am attending college again for the first time since I dropped out in 2013). I felt all the energy that laid dormant for four years resurface in a way that (for some reason) I didn't expect. I hate glorifying something that is certainly not a good thing, but I fully believe in transparency and this is just how I felt at the time.

Since being under quarantine, I had given myself an excuse to dabble for a short while. I knew what to expect this time around, and I made the strict decision to stop with ample time for the comedown once I got a return date from my manager.
It's been about a month now since I've picked up the shit again (about a month and a half of no work) and my manager sprung it on me that we are due back to work this upcoming weekend under strict limitations. 

While I am happy to be able to go back to work and have something positive and productive to do, I have about two and a half days to come down and I was not  entirely prepared to be going back to work until another couple weeks.

I am ready to come down and have been through this ride before, but I am just analyzing the whole situation and I sorta feel shitty. I know that sobriety is a daily battle and that failure is often inevitable, but I just hate being reminded that I will forever have this demon stalking my every move, waiting for the day it can convince me that drugs or alcohol are the only things that can ease the pain for a while.

I don't want to lie to myself or to you all and say that this is it for me. I'm not going to say I will not make the mistake of doing drugs or drinking again... but I know for right now that I can get through this, and I know it will be easier than before. After all that I've gone through, I have made it through much worse. I have my vices, and they will sneak up on me again, but I will not allow them to take away the strength I have gained from years of heartache. I hope the same for others who have struggled or are struggling now. 

Thanks for reading if you've made it this far... If you can take anything from this novel of a post, just take comfort in the fact that you are not completely alone on your journey. You will fall. You will get back up for a while, and you will fall again. As long as a breath remains in your lungs, there is hope. 

TL;DR - I relapsed after reaching four years clean from meth, and I'm quitting this bender with humility and a refreshed point of view.",39,"{'covid': 1, 'quarantine': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9949234127998352}"

I've been on it since spring 2018, but granted I was taking too high of a dose from the get go.  I'm at the point where I've taken a total of 60 mg Adderall IR (orally) over the course of about 6ish hours and have felt extremely minimal effects.  Virtually no mental stimulation of any kind - no significant increases in focus, anxiety, euphoria, analysis acceleration, etc. Had some Mild physical effects: some sweating, some dry mouth, slight vasoconstriction, feeling a little more awake ""physically"" but not mentally.  The only reason I take it anymore is to avoid being completely unfocused and lethargic so I can at least do some academic work.

Just taking more would probably not do anything good: If I took like 90 mg all at once, I'm certain all I'd feel is weird/uncomfortable physical stimulation with little effect on mental stimulation, maybe some anxiety.  **If I'm taking as much as I am and still getting minimal effects have I ""hit the roof"" on my oral amphetamine use?**

I am trying to get sober and I have been reading lots about supplements that have helped many with their withdrawal symtoms/ extreme brain fog associated with coming off of stims. In particular, I read a lot about L-tryosine and 5HTP. I have been trying to figure out the proper dosing ratio and after reading this article : [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3415362/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3415362/)  I am extremely confused as to what I should be using as a supplement. This article states that in order to see any positive effects from 5HTP, it is important that you take it with L-tyrosine and L-dopa, and it is crucial that they are all properly balanced. 

Just wondering if anyone has any thoughts related to this or if they have any recommendations for supplements (and what amounts) they used to help them get sober.

So I've been clean from meth since the beginning of January. I've been addicted for 1.5 years, with 4 months clean in between. Unfortunately I switched to crack and used more Heroin and pills than before, knowing that I'd go to rehab in March.

I was a fucking literal crackhead at that time, smoking 30-60 bucks of crack and used a G of brown a day. That was obviously enough to keep me off the clear.

Now I've been almost 2 months clean off of everything and until a few days ago everything was great. I put on 8 kilos got a fucking Sixpacks going ain't talking beer.

The problem is that I get insane urges to take meth and have sex/masturbate again, which is all I did stimd up. I always think about that and get a dopamine rush that makes me wanna use and it's very uncomfortable.

Will this ever stop? I feel like I can never experience sex the same and never forget what it felt like.
Is there anything I can do?

So it's been 25 days since I have used Adderall. I'm looking to quit, and now seems to be the best time to do so. (Quarantine senior year before going into the real world.) However I'm falling way behind on the online school work and college application stuff I still have, and meanwhile my laundry is everryywhhereeee making little things feel impossible. After a weekish of internal debating, I felt that I had decided and called in a refill two days ago. It should be ready today, and my plan is to take 1 or 2 for myself to clean for a weekend, and give the rest to my buddy who can hold onto it for me. I don't expect the quitting mindset to vanish once I dose because the negative effects are so permanently seared into my noggin, so once I come down from that then should proceed to make sober progress on school work, home maintenance, life skills etc. in a cleaner, non-overwhelming environment.

When I first started using Adderall it was only every once in a while and so it felt really good and the side effects didn't build up, nor did I feel like death the next day. If I can have some self control with it (and a friend's help for now) then I think this could work, similarly to how it did in the beginning. (Except i'd be tapering off instead.)

The Good

I was first introduced to the drug by my best friend about 1.5 years ago- at that time, my own experience with drugs really only consisted of weed (was a massive stoner at the time) and a few occasional encounters with cocaine and shrooms. My friend had been diagnosed with ADHD from a very early age and had access to a very generous Dexedrine script. As we needed to cram through a relatively important assignment by EOD, he enthusiastically suggested I take some Dex- and as this was an important course, I said fuck it and accepted his offer. It was around 1 pm at the time, he gave me a 15mg XR and two 5mg IR pills, which I took all at once, not expecting much. About 45mins to an hour I really felt it kick in- the only way I could describe it at the time was that it felt like cocaine, but much more controlled and relaxed. I spent the next 9-10 hours demolishing the assignment, before moving onto other schoolwork- I probably completed about a week's worth of work in one sitting. Music sounded unbelievable, my Juul was hitting me on a different level, and I couldn’t stop talking. Although I didn't get a moments sleep and was later introduced to the hell that is as an amphetamine come down, I was fucking sold. For the remainder of the term, I would study with my friend every chance I could, largely to get my hands on more of those magic orange pills, which he was only too happy to provide. My grades shot up, I achieved nothing but As and Bs that term, ending the year with my highest average throughout my time at university. I used the stuff wisely too- when I had no schoolwork left, I applied to internships and jobs like never before, managing to secure a dream position at an investment bank that summer. By the time the exams ended and the term came to a close, I felt unbelievably grateful to have been introduced to this miracle drug- for once in my life/ university career, everything seemed to be under control and headed in the right direction- good grades, great job lines up for the summer and I had been accepted into the exchange program at my university. 

The Bad

There were a few early signals that these new habits were not as perfect as I perhaps imagined. For instance, at the end of the term I remember feeling sad that my exams were over because it meant no more dex-fueled study sessions- looking back, this should have been a major indicator that I was already becoming addicted/ dependent: what kind of fucking student is sad that final exams are over? (Lol). When I got back home to Europe that summer, those first days without access to dex I found myself in a lifeless, depressed state. Regardless, my new job and a generally fun time seeing old friends and partying got me through that summer. But in the back of my mind, I kept thinking about my first study sesh once I was back at school and reunited with my mate (we were both going to be spending the term on exchange). Whilst going on exchange during uni is supposed one of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences, spent partying and meeting new friends, it wouldn’t be the case for me. I ended up bullshitting my way to getting a prescription practically the first week of school (25mg/ day, 15mg XR and 2x5mg IR). I justified spending my days locked in my room studying by telling everyone I was taking a difficult courseload, made worse because it was a new/ different uni. The reality is that at this point I was completely hooked on dex- my daily intake typically hovered around the 50-60mg mark. I would pop them as soon I woke up and would spend the day going through my list of tasks like a robot with intermittent Juul breaks, whilst drinking absurd amounts of water due to the dry mouth. At the end of the day, I would deal with the comedown by smoking absurd amounts of weed- not a particularly healthy combination (mentally and physically). Although the point was to ace all my courses, it started having the opposite effect- although I spent all day studying and working my grades suffered more because I was rarely in class, usually skipping because I had been unable to get any sleep the night before. I lost all sense of enjoyment for the things I used to love- I stopped working out and playing sports completely, and I hadn’t come close to having sex all term (for perspective, I’d pulled 5-6 times that summer). Overall, dex addiction totally ruined what should’ve otherwise been a fantastic experience on exchange. 

The Ugly

We now arrive at the present aka this past school term until it was cut short by coronavirus. At this point, my life mostly consisted of binging dexedrine once I picked up my script, pulling 2/3 all-nighters a week and the occasional back-to-back one. Because I was consuming absurd amounts of the stuff, I’d usually finish my monthly supply within 10-15 days, the spending the time until my next refill as a lazy lump, mostly smoking weed and aimlessly picking around on the internet. I looked like shit- my weight fluctuated constantly and many of my friends remarked that I looked “older”, likely due to how little sleep I usually got. My logic or justification was that this was just temporary- a necessary evil to achieve the ultimate goal of graduating uni and moving onto the next stage of my life. When school moved online due to the coronavirus pandemic a few weeks ago, I ended up going back to my parents house back in Europe again where I was able to quickly transfer my American script and get access to the local equivalent. As usual, I wolfed down my script in no time (took only 10 days or so), but at this point my productivity is nowhere near what it once used to be, and my comedowns are causing me more anxiety than ever. The worst effects, however, would come once I ran out- as I had what can only be defined as a psychotic episode. Whilst attempting to sleep after a 2-3 day binge, I felI into a stream of 5-6 bouts of sleep paralysis in the space of an hour, which is terrifying enough to begin with, but each time felt so intense that I seriously thought I was fully awake and having a stroke. I have been able to really recognise the extent of my addiction/ dependency over these past few weeks- mostly bc of the fact that I’m in my parent's company (who can clearly see my mood swings/ changes in behaviour) and that there’s really no need at this point (moving online basically ended the school term early and most of the outside world is on hold atm). As I really have no reason to try and get more of the stuff (and definitely wouldn’t be able to somehow justify it to my parents), I decided that enough is enough- a long break is needed.",10,"{'rona': 2, 'virus': 2, 'pandemic': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9694191813468933}"

This is probably a smaller thing to what I've seen so far seen on this page but 6 or so years ago I was diagnosed with ADD and was prescribed dexamphetamine to help with the symptoms. In the beginning I was instructed to take 7 a day (35mg all up) anyway for a while there it really fixed a whole lot but then it started to go pear shaped. I took more and more over the course of maybe 3 years. Usually going through 100 tablets in a week. I always managed to somehow get repeats super early then kept running out and finding myself saying something to my psychiatrist and getting extras when I ran out. I went without in the end because I fucked up and spent 9 months or so unmedicated. Once I made it through the withdrawals I still felt altered. I feel like something is lost. Like nothing is interesting to me anymore unless I'm taking pills and it feels like I can't go back to how I was before I got diagnosed and medicated in the first place. My brain just feels like it's different and I'm nothing without this stuff. It's been running my life for years. I'm just wondering if anyone else has been through this and if you have some advice you could give. Thanks so much :),19,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9914785027503967}"

Has anyone had lasting damage from use and is it manageable/treatable?,"I am a 27/f Canada, 5’1” and 105 pounds for reference.

I was introduced to coke just over a year ago through my bf and have been using maybe up to 4 times a month, typically long into the night. I don’t know exactly how much I use but would say I do 2-3 lines an hour for up to 8 hours at most sometimes. I’d say half the times I’ve used I was drinking as well which I know is terrible.
Last July (6 months into this type of use) I had an ECG done as part of another checkup and my doctor said there was something unusual about the result, something about q-waves. She said they sometimes see that in people who have had a heart attack but I haven’t had one so she said she wouldn’t worry too much. I didn’t think too much of it and my specialist who was supposed to review the result seemed to have forgot to bring it up during my appointment and she’s retired now.

I am in a state of panic right now because I’m reading more about coke and heart damage. While I knew it was a huge risk, because I wasn’t using daily I didn’t think it would catch up to me like this.
A few days ago I was laughing really hard about something (like a can’t catch my breath type of laugh) and noticed a sort of pressure or pulling on the left side of my chest which eventually dissipated after I stopped laughing and calmed down. This is when I became especially concerned. I looked into anginas and it seems like this could potentially be one except the ache was only in a specific area centre-left of my chest and I didn’t have the pain that supposedly goes down the left arm or anywhere else.

Can someone please tell me if any damage I could have caused is reversible? Does it sound like I could have a heart attack any moment? I know I’m an idiot, know I need to stop. I’m not reliant on it to function but my boyfriend is an addict and sometimes I end up using with him.

He hears voices, is obviously laughing at himself sometimes, mildly paranoid, and is randomly agitated.

He quit using meth around March 18th after about 8 months of binging behavior, and (according to him) has relapsed once, the voices haven't gotten quieter at any point during his sobriety. The voices keep him up at night and apparently are telling him hearing voices isn't normal and he needs help. He has never had any mental issues before this- and with the voices starting so soon after he quit cold turkey, leads me to believe it is meth induced.

He isn't to a point where this is dangerous in my opinion, I am bigger then him and could over power him in most scenarios. He also recognizes these aren't real voices and normally catches himself if he is getting angry for no reason.

I am kind of lost here, this is my best friend and he dropped most of this on me the last few days and he doesn't know what to do. He is going to stay with me for the week so I can help him get a grip on things.

I hope that if I convince him to sober up permanently from meth, it can help clear this up, but I don't know if maybe I should talk to his dad about getting him set up at a hospital or something for 30 days. Which I doubt they would even accept him with the lock down going on.

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

I've pretty much always hated my birthday, idk why but the day always fills me with a deep pit of misery and for the past several years I've spent the day in bed feeling sorry for myself, until people start to drag me out for some celebration. 

I started smoking meth in January, bc my boyfriend relapsed back into his habit and idk I guess he wanted someone to smoke with. Idk why I did it, I think I was just curious and enamored with my new relationship, and I liked having something that was just for us two. I didn't even like this shit the first few times, it made me grouchy and lazy(undiagnosed ADHD, I think), and the nights of no sleep made me have multiple anxious meltdowns. I didn't want to do it anymore after the first couple times, but I also didn't want my BF to be a methhead on his own. I was definitely cutting back though, and no binging so I could still go to work. 

Pretty soon after that started BF had some issues with the cops and he decided to move in with me so he could be in the city instead of an hour away in a different town. I agreed, because I was infatuated with him, and most of the dope had been bought with my money, so I need his welfare to help me cover rent. He moved in, and basically what followed is 2 straight months of 3 or 4 day binges, a couple days of come down and recovery, being geeked on meth every single day at work, until in march both my jobs closed because of the pandemic. Somewhere in there BF got back into fentanyl, and his mood swings got lots worse, and my meth-induced fragility irritated him even more. Sometimes it was bad, but I honestly liked the fentanyl/meth combo better than just meth, because on opiates he would finally want to cuddle and hold me, and was 50x as affectionate in general. 

Things have just been getting worse and worse. I have lost maybe 20 or 25 pounds and while my body dysmorphia is somewhat happy finally, every time I look in the mirror I think about how heartbroken my mom would be to see me like this, eyes all glazed and sunken, bones sticking out where they never did before, lips all sore and red. I don't know how it got this bad, and I don't know how to make it better. I have no one to talk to about it, I can't tell my friends or family that I'm addicted to meth and my boyfriend doesn't want to hear me complain about the state I'm in. 

My savings have gone to dope. My apartment is a disaster, I can't pay rent, and I can't work because of the health problems we both have. I fucked up so so bad and I'm scared that this is going to kill me, or leave me huddled on the street somewhere, and then I'll have thrown my life away for someone who isn't sure if he truly loves me. I know he's just fucked up on drugs all the time too and that's why he acts like that, and he tells me to not take it personally but after a while it weighs me down, and I slide into depression. That's when I stop smoking, and then the come down makes me more depressed, which triggers BF to use more and he gets me to use again so I can be in a better mood and not just mope around the apartment. We're dead broke and he was having to steal bikes to sell to get our dope, leaving the apartment at 2am and coming back after it was light out. I feel like there's nothing left in my brain of the person I used to be, my personality has been wiped away and there's only hopelessness and fear. I don't see how I can keep living like this, but then the smoke hits me and I feel like a person again, not even high, just functional and thriving, and my brain is working and things are okay, until the come down creeps in and it wasn't even worth it.  

I just don't know how it got so bad so fast. I know I can come back from it, I know I can get clean and healthy and start my life back on track, but everytime he and I try to get clean and it doesn't work I get more scared that it just won't ever work. And as stupid as it sounds, I want us to get better together so we can be together as our best selves, not these hollow versions we are now, because he can treat me so well and make me feel like no one else as long as drugs aren't taking over his brain. 

I've felt a little more hopeful this week, I got some financial aid from the government so we got food and he started on a suboxone and kadian  taper for the fent use. I ordered some micro dosing shroom capsules for my withdrawals, and we would stock up on food and weed and video games and ride out the quarantine like that before starting our lives for real. I thought it was going to work, or at least we would have a few weeks of recovery even if we did end up relapsing. I still dreaded my birthday coming up, but I was kind of looking forward to ordering in some food for a treat and chilling on the couch watching tv together, since we just picked up good dope and meth, so we could quit on a good note. 

BF ate a couple points of the meth and did a few small dragons, and I had my pipe and last night was going great, talking and chilling while we each worked on little individual projects, but the meth we got was fucking crazy and once he peaked on it that was kind of the end of whatever I had hoped for my birthday. He got mad at me about the budget I had made for the month and said we werent going to spend any more money, so of course I wasn't going to expect a present or birthday takeout, and i've spent the past 12 hours curled up in my spot on the couch, smoking and sewing and now and then crying because fuck man this isn't how I wanted anything to go and the one person I can get any attention or support from is making it very clear that he thinks i am annoying and never really even acknowledged my birthday. I feel like a brat for crying because my birthday isn't how I wanted, but all I really want for now is have him cuddle next to me and watch some dumb tv show and I can finally feel safe for a few moments before the anxiety seeps in. 
He can't hold me even if he wanted, because i am currently monitoring his fever after he came in from outside with potential brain swelling. Everyone has said it's okay, but I don't know what i'll do if he goes to hospital or has a serious injury from this stupid fucking drug 

So I'm 21 today, and my boyfriend might be dying from meth hyperthermia, and I needed to get all of that out because I don't have a single soul I can tell it to. I just wish i had never touched that fucking pipe",33,"{'pandemic': 1, 'quarantine': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9895409941673279}"

Hey y'all. I'm graduating high school and don't want to be dependent on adhd meds forever, so after two-ish years I figured quarantine is the ideal time to quit for good and hopefully have my energy back before summer! I've taken tolerance breaks and half heartedly ""quit"" several times before, usually after taking miserably large doses and running out early. Those 1-2 weeks were usually just a relief, time spent relaxing, sleeping, and actually enjoying food, kind of like a reset. By the time I could get a refill the cravings would have started, so I would always go overboard and the cycle would repeat.

At the start of week 3, (which I haven't reached in who knows how long,) the negative withdrawal feelings really hit, hard. Although I did stop quite abruptly after a binge, it was so unpleasant that the first two weeks went really well. I felt a normal amount of sadness, an expected amount of tired and hungry but mostly just excited at the prospect of being off of it for good. When week three hit it was rough and I cried a lot, but I know it will pass, and I seem to be leveling out after that extreme dip.

My biggest issue now is the excruciating fatigue...  I've got so many messes piling up around me, fruit flies in the kitchen, laundry to do, etc. Easy, simple things to fix. But it's so hard to find the energy and motivation to do them when I'm reminiscing about the high of cleaning on adderall.. Popping a pill, taking an awesome sh\*t, saying ""today's gonna be a good day."" Then getting the boring chores out of the way in the morning while you're still coming up, it gets your blood flowing and leaves you free the rest of the day to do your own thing and ride that wave. It didn't happen every time but golly gee if I don't miss when it did.

I drink coffee and it does nothing for me energy wise. I need to take a tolerance break on that, too. I'm mostly ranting, but to anybody in a similar situation, past, present, friends, whatever, do you have any advice or reassurance? (I'm a sucker even for cheesy inspiration, so don't hold back lol) Even just discussing it would be super helpful, my friends don't really understand addiction/withdrawal.

Basically everyday give or take a day or two. I tried quitting once and I’m not proud to admit it but sadly that didn’t even last 24 hours... No one knows that I’ve been smoking meth except the girl that’s been selling it to me and as of recently her car took a shit on her so she won’t be able to bring me anymore. So I guess it’s a blessing in disguise. But even if she could still bring it I desperately need to quit. Not just for myself but also for my husband and my son. You see my husband has this really good job and the occasionally do random drug tests on him. I’ve done a lot of research and have thoroughly freaked myself out into thinking that by me smoking it and having it in my system I am somehow passing it on to him and could make him piss dirty and loose his dream job. So there’s reason number 1 why I need to quit. I’m also scared that I am somehow passing it on to my son by skin contact or my clothes or SOMETHING so there’s reason number 2 on why I need to quit. I don’t think I can keep hiding this from everyone for much longer... I feel like when I’m high it’s very obvious to everyone around me but I could just be paranoid... I mainly think this because my pupils get HUGE no matter how much or how little I smoke. Reason number 3. So I have my reasons to quit and I know I won’t be able to get anymore after whatever I have left is done with. I’m hoping I can have enough will power to just toss the remainder of the bag away tonight... I’m at least going to try my hardest to... I usually sleep almost every night. There’s been maybe a couple times I’ve stayed up all night just cause I got distracted on my phone but I always slept the following night. I eat decently... isssssh.... 


SoI guess the reason I’m posting here is because I’m curious what’s really in store for me once I’m finally out... 


What will the comedown/withdrawals be/feel like?


Is there anything I can do, take, or eat to help lessen them? I should probably add that I can only get OTC stuff. The only prescription stuff I have access to is Lyrica


How long does it all usually last?


Is there anything I can do to help myself with cravings? 


Any and all advice is greatly and desperately needed and welcomed!

Got off work around 3am in the morning. I got outside and as soon as I smelled the fresh spring air, I cried. I cried in pure happiness and yet sadness. The reason is as I smelled that pure spring air, it took me back to a decade ago when I was in middle school. Because in 2010 it was pure innocence and joy, you are free with no worries. I was only 15.. Had 4 good friends, I am best friends with one of them; he was a big reason I quit, because he was worried about my mental well being and really got me out the negative headspace and 24/7 use, (he does not use, he used to be addicted to cocaine. But clean now for 2 years). NOW back to what I was saying, I thought about that 15 year old (me), and I remember smoking weed with my friends and we talked about how we would ONLY smoke weed because meth, cocaine and everything else were something we would never dare to touch. Here I am 25 and thinking about myself from 10 years ago. If that 15 year old (me) saw me he would be in such disappointment. 10 years and here I am, getting clean for the 3rd time in 3 years, it’s an on and off thing with me, I got on binges and then quit for a 9-12 months and then do it again. But what I am saying is, I know what I need to do to better my life. It’s not fucking rocket science. It’s straight forward. I’m on day 4. It’s easy at times, but the emotional pain comes with it.

As I type this I am sitting down at work, before that I was mapping out tracks for a musical project I am working on with a couple of great people, started the project to focus on that than wanting to get high on meth. I guess I am okay. Not 100% but getting there. I am thankful for things in life because I really thought I would never escape, this is my 3rd time stopping. Before that i was sober for a year and half. The thing with me is, I’ll go on fat binge for 3-4 months and then stopping. I’m very hard on myself with certain things, this is one of them. I let myself down but I am trying to get back up and not whine and bitch because I did this to myself and this is my wrong doing, no one except for myself. I have only 2-3 people know that I told about my issue and I praise them for really getting me out of that. I am getting through this. A cup of coffee is helping. I think for me; it’s time to retire the whole “let’s get high and have fun” ya know? I’m not in high school I am in my mid 20’s and it’s just time to grow the fuck up. I used to have bad anxiety and cravings for the first 2 times I stopped. But this time it’s different “in a good way”. I think I have finally realized that I’m actually done with this drug or just drugs in general. I need to achieve my goals and become someone who wants more out of life than the little things I have been doing. Time to step it up. I’m more than willing to do that as well. Its been a crazy 4 months. I texted a friend and told him “where did the time go?” Because as I was on my way home on day 2, it just hit me that all I have been doing is creating art, working and going home.

The nature of my work made me unessential and I've been sheltering in place since about March 15th. Supporting a habit up until then was feasible while making ends meet... but only enough to make ends meet. Well, I ran out of money by about the 28th and have been sober since.

I really just wanted a platform to celebrate this and I felt like this would be the perfect outlet.

Granted, I'm still in the early phases and there's no telling what will happen once my unemployment and tax returns start rolling in, but I'm hopeful for myself as I am all of you.

Or we dont know how to help you anna weve tried everything. And my drug and alcohol counselor said she felt bad taking my money cause she had no idea how to help me. 
I'm talking about amputation of my husbands knees. I am 34 years old. This is childhood traumas controlling me and my brain. I can taste freedom from my(these) chains 

So.I did up to 15 inhalers in a day average was 6. For 3 or 4 days then crash and repeat for months till I found out I was 6 mos pregnant. I slowed down a lot. But I had stolen every inhaler from about 18 stores in 3 county's for about 6 months total. I would often not sleep for 3days. Drawing till my hands bled thinking the lump in my gut may be an obstruction from eating the cotton. 6 at a time sometimes redosing 6inhalers once or twice before I would rest over a day or two.

As of now Averaging 12 -24 per week. Mostly on my work days 3 or 4 at a time in 1 day sometimes 2×3/4. Does this make any sense? I tear it in 4 and down it with whole milk or smoothie. No taste. That's just the last year or so... This is the beginning of the 4th year since I discovered propylhexedrine. The 2nd year I had tried to quit with an iop and lasted 4 days and at one point I quit for 3 months...i was pregnant with my son and I wasnt using more than 1 at a time maybe 2 or 3 days per week. I tried. Most of the first year was rough though... I started buying a couple here and there and was at the tail end of a supply of Ritalin due to guilt from stealing it out of my clients grandaughters belongings. I couldnt live like that anymore and the inhalers came at just the right time so that I could continue to be enslaved by these various types of uppers. My tolerance is sky high from excess of coffee energy drinks ephedrine adderall vyvance concerta huffing aerosol cans robitrippin Benadryl tripping rarely alcohol or opiates go figure! Weeds not a drug but it makes me use sugar.. carbs and junk food pork. Obviously not all at the same time or durarion or intensity... But ive always had an issue with excess stimulants the last few years i was using way too much ephedrine and caffeine and lacked good nutrition or sleep for several years. Adderall was in my life for the first year and I screwed my job by stealing a bunch klonopin from a client and leaving my shift taking all of em and going to the ER. I had also recently been getting a liking for xanax that a friend was feeding me so they admitted me to detox. I never heard from that job and we moved into my parents camper and I huffed all summer. It had been 9 years since I did that as a teenager.    
 Anyway Im lost in the details cause Im trying to remember. I have a seizure disorder called temporal lobe epilepsy. And I'm sure itwas caused by huffing and triggerd by the excess of stimulants which dehydration and lack of sleep and food are also common triggers also.

In the time I didn't take it I was a full time competitive cheerleader practicing 5 days a week hours on end training and conditioning. I had well enough energy for me and never thought about the drug.

I am 20 years old will be 21 in September (:

While in high school I heard one of my friends talking about how they got prescribed and it was the best thing ever and I remember asking myself ""I wonder why I stopped taking my prescription?"" . Probably not long after that I started my prescription back up at a 20mg dosage and felt like a whole new productive me. I lost weight and felt like I was on top of the world but never really correlated the adderall and my productiveness, I was a dumb high schooler I know. But after my body started getting used to my 20 mg dosage I soon realized I hadn't been doing the same in sports or school and decided maybe I need to up my dosage so now I have been taking a 30 mg dosage ever since. 

I developed an eating disorder while in the mists of starting taking it again and went from 175 to about 110. I don't think the eating disorder stemmed from the adderall, just a toxic high school relationship, but I defiantly used it to stop my appetite. Thankfully my eating disorder has gotten better and I'm doing good with that, but as any person that has had a ED I'm so scared to give into the craving that my stopping adderall makes me have and completely hating myself:(

I am wanting to enlist into the military and have to stop taking it...

To be quite frank I'm scared shitless, because after switching to the 30 mg dosage I started to depend on adderall more and more. Say I accidentally forgot to take it one day or my pharmacy didn't fill my prescription in time I will break down in a anxiety attack because the effects of not taking it after taking it for so long are ruthless and just didn't want to have to go through it. The complete lack of energy I have and the appetite of 4 grown men really do a toll on me. I never really thought anything of it and didn't take it seriously, I just thought that it was me being lazy.

I don't know the clear defining of being addicted or being dependent on the drug I just know when I wake up I just have a routine of waking up taking my adderall having a coffee and some breakfast then after it would start to kick in I would proceed to do what I had to do that day.

I have tried not to take it weeks at a time, not stopping all together, every once and awhile because I didn't think the adderall was the thing making me, me. I would eventually gain weight from the constant eating, and then proceed to sleep and sleep and sleep. Eventually ending up taking it again thinking I didn't take it for a week and didn't like the person I was and just thought that was my personality.

SOOOO with all that said I don't even know where to start. I don't think slowly reducing my dosage will work, I feel FOR ME, I just have to stop taking it all together. I'm hoping there are people who have gone through similar situation or just even quitting the drug like I am attempting to do.

Tomorrow I am not going to take my adderall and need advice on what to do to help the crash of the drug. I am desperate for any tips because I am so scared of the physical and mental exhaustion from stopping.

I spend the whole day in a tunnel vision on things that dont matter, scrolling through my phone, video games, literally just wanking off for hours, bad habits galore.

I keep getting trapped in a cycle where my work-related anxieties and desire to be perfect push me into taking Adderall, only to have anxiety over the effects the drug is having on my brain push me into going off it again.

I'm afraid of going off. I'm afraid I won't be able to do my job well (it's a very analytical job). When I don't take it, I'm way more impulsive than I used to be without Adderall. Before I ever took this drug, I was very disciplined in various ways. I procrastinated, but that was really the only thing I wasn't good at. When I *needed* to study, I could, and there were times I was able to shut myself in the library for a full ten hours. Will I ever be able to get back to that? I'm afraid that I won't be. I was only just learning to be disciplined like that right before I got put on the medication.

I'm definitely not the worst case on here, but if I'm going to kill the habit, I want to kill it as early as I can before more damage is done. I threw away whatever Adderall and Vyvanse I had left today, and then I took the trash out to the dumpster to make sure I wouldn't go rooting through my trash to pull the pills back out (which I've done once before when I was trying to quit). These pills have destroyed whatever little confidence I had in myself to perform without the drug, so this is the only way I can make sure I don't take them again.

I still haven't messaged my doctor to tell them not to prescribe psychostimulants for ADHD ever again. I guess part of me still wants the lifeline of being able to go back if I get too afraid of continuing. I also don't want to cause a scene since my case really isn't even that bad, *and* I *did* move out of state since my last refill, so that also creates a barrier.

Anyway, I'm sorry that this post is so disorganized.

She gave me a slap across the cheek and we had to leave for work. Which honestly I cant be mad at her response. I was just hoping for some understanding. It was a short sighted, ""oh its right in front of me"", poor impulse control moment, after 3 weeks cold turkey. We later talked about it and she apologized for the cheek slap but she was just mad and disappointed which I get. I was too at myself the second I railed the line.


Fast forward 2 weeks (to 2 days ago), out of nowhere one of my plugs comes into my place of work out of pure chance to get some food. He asks if I wanted to pick up, and at that moment i was pretty down do to a lot of added stress the past week. I had made decent tips and I thought fuck it, I'm I've concealed myself decently before. Was kinda careless, did enough to give enough hints that I was high. Pretty sure my girl new because she made meth related remarks and jokes a handful of times throughout the day. And during a conversation, she told me that she wants to go back to how it was before where whenever I did it, I did it at home, around her so she can keep an eye on me, and it would only be once in a while, instead of going behind her back (she never directly called me out however) That arrangement came to a halt when I had gone overboard, without her realizing, and had a nonstop 2 week binge. I wanted to never touch this shit again, but I guess that would be kind of a lie. I guess I now realize the truth of only buy what you plan on using, nothing more.


I think it's pretty safe to say that she knew I was high. Maybe she didn't directly call me out to give me a room to come clean about it myself? Either way I'm conflicted, because I went behind her back a second time. And now she moved the goal post to accommodate, which just doesn't sit right with me, but the outcome is still mutually preferred.

I’ve been taking 2x my dosage everyday for the last 3+ years. I run out of my script 2 weeks early every month and go into a huge sleep / food induced withdrawal. I can’t concentrate, I’m extremely emotional and agitated. After two weeks of turmoil I get my script back, stay up all night cleaning the messes I made the weeks prior and pop the rest like candy until it’s gone. 

Every month I tell myself the same lie: “This month will be different, I won’t run out!” And by the end of the two weeks I’m disappointed in myself and my anxiety sky rockets. It’s embarrassing and I’m ashamed. 

I didn’t have the willpower or self control to limit my consumption. I became a slave to the vicious cycle. 

With all of this being said, I FOUND A WAY to get back on track. 
I had to put aside my pride, relinquish control and hand the bottle over to my fiancé. Every night he gives me my dosage for the next day. It took a few days of adjusting and reprogramming my brain to work with the dosage I had. After the first week, I felt better than ever before. I’ve even taken LESS than my daily dosage because I try to stretch the pills out longer——and what do you know? It works better. It works how it’s suppose to. I feel so relieved. 

I know not everyone has someone they trust to do this for them— but I just wanted to share my experience in hopes that it resonates with someone who needs to hear it. I went through years of painful, excessive binges and I didn’t see any way out.....but it’s possible.

One of the worst feelings about the lack of stimulation is the depression. It can feel like you're in some zombie induced daydream for months and sometimes even years depending on how much you used and what led up to it. Like you're not exactly dead, but not exactly living either. I'm not saying this to scare anyone because you can and will recover from this. But depression can make it hard to focus, exercise, talk, and even remember things. 

Sometimes I honestly don't even remember the days or the people in it. I just always find myself lying in bed thinking back on all this guilt, embarrassment, and fear. I want to feel alive again. I want to have motivation to find passion in things, to love to read again, and even play video games. I can barely even find the energy to cook a meal after work. Sometimes I wonder why I'm even trying.

But even though this might be a sob story, I'm at least hopeful. Any form of true drug abuse is a dead-end road. There's no happy ending to it.

I’m goin to rehab y’all! This post was originally a comment in another sub but it explains pretty much how i got to where i am.","Well i started smoking weed and doing drugs when i was 15 (i’m 16 now, yea shit happens fast) and my parents were always pissed off taking shit away like my door like stealing my cash and shit. I didn’t care tho i was gonna get high no matter what anybody said or did. So eventually i got involved with a bad crowd and really addictive drugs and i had to start stealing and robbing to support my habit. At this point i was using weed, like 7 bars of xanax, and shooting lot heroin everyday. So that went on for a while until i got arrested initially for aggravated assault, but the cops came into my room which had a lot of heroin and pills and weed in, like i shoudve gone to prison for a very long time idk how they only ended up charging me with just assault which was a misdemeanor it was crazy. So i served 30 days which was awful cause i was detoxing the entire time and i was literally having seizures and they didn’t give a fuck but eventually they gave me some anti convulsant or sum shit and somehow i didn’t die. But i got through it and i was like fuck drugs im going to rehab and i’m staying clean. So i went to rehab for 30 days after i got out of jail and it worked out for a while. I was just smoking weed and working construction with my dad. I kinda dropped out of high school but it was a wierd situation i was having trouble focusing in school so my school let me just work for now and study for some like diploma equivalency test that was supposed to happen in march but got postponed for like months because of the coronavirus. But eventually i started getting bored and wanted to do drugs again but i didn’t want to be all slumped and puking all day cause i wanted to keep my job. So i hit up one of my old friends who hooked me up with this chick who sold meth. So i started just snorting it for a while and riding around with her and my parents didn’t really have a clue i was just gone a lot. Like i would still go to sleep at night and eat and shit. So eventually me and this girl started dating and i’m kinda gettin involved in this drug game again but this time from a different perspective, i didn’t need to rob and steal from people to get high anymore. And i was still able to keep my job because the drug just made me more focused and talkative, nobody ever has a clue when i’m high on meth unless i’ve been up for days. But eventually my meth use starts to get more frequent and that turns to everyday. At that point i’m not even feeling the high anymore i just needed that drug to have energy for the day. But my girlfriend had been smoking it so i was like fuck it i’ll try that. I was instantly hooked and immediately went on a 4 day bender with her. And i knew i was gonna need more than weed for the comedown and we sold black tar so there was my reason to start shooting again. Come home absolutely trashed and my dad used to be a tweaker so i he could kinda tell i was tweakin. Shot up and went to sleep, woke up and needed to hit a bowl right then. I was in the cycle again. My mom eventually found one of my broken meth pipes and so my dad fired me. So i’m back just making money on the street and after about a month now i’m getting kicked out unless i get help.

I’m weirdly envious of my past self and those still in active use. It’s so just easy just to give in and get high when your life is already in ruins.

It was easier before this lockdown when my social life was starting to come back together. I was learning how to connect with people and have fun socializing for the first time in my life. But now I’m forced to isolate again. I don’t want to root for a premature return to normal life because I want other people to be safe, but the isolation is taking away my biggest motivator to stay clean and making me more likely to compromise my own safety. I’d rather risk infection than relapse but that’s not fair to everyone else.

I just bought components for an amazing gaming PC, but now I’m stressing out about how much I spent on it. I hope it brings me something to look forward to while waiting this out.

I’ve been on Bupropion XL 150 for the last 2 months with mostly positive results.  I felt unbelievable 2 weeks ago but have leveled off since then.  Feeling bad enough right now to get back on this thread.  

I have a doctor’s appointment on Friday.  Should I ask him about bumping up to 300 mg or is that too much?  I don’t want to overdo it, but I feel like I would benefit from going up a notch.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9828123450279236}"

It is not painful. Just very annoying. 

When I look in the mirror I can see little muscular twitches, in particular closer to the [front of the temporalis muscle by the auriculotemporal nerve and temporal branch of the facial nerve.](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B9780721605197000162-gr5.jpg) It's almost like muscle fasciculations, alongside with paresthesia (pins and needles) over the area - and it is unilateral (right side).  

I have had full physicals, blood work done, head CT, head MRI. All negative. 

I have tried physiotherapy, massage therapy, acupuncture, chiropractor, etc. 

The pharmaceuticals ibuprofen, clonazepam and pregabalin helps moderately. 

It's been happening for years now and has not gotten better nor worse. 

The onset was very sudden and noticeable, overnight one day. 

It is worth noting that my right TMJ joint is sometimes very sore. 

Appreciate any thoughts. I think I will join the ranks of /r/StopSpeeding and see if reducing Stims down to zero for a prolonged period of time helps.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9910686016082764}"

I’ve been through outpatient and inpatient rehab and I keep fucking relapsing. The reason why I relapse is because I’ve never been able to be honest with my therapists and group and it’s because I’m really ashamed. I end up taking pills that are cut with meth and I just watch porn and jerk off for hours on end (8 + hours). It’s fucking sad and pathetic, which is why I haven’t been able to tell anyone. I only use stimulants to jerk off. It’s so fucking hard to quit this shit. I need help. Please.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9982975125312805}"

Sharing this survey again  [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/P7KNLG5](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/P7KNLG5), as I'm hoping to get some more anonymous responses. I know it does take a couple of minutes of reflection, but it would be very helpful if you could share your experiences. The survey is for people struggling with an addiction, specifically about the challenges you might have faced trying to find the right type of treatment/help for you.

one random thing: a few days ago around midnight, i was trying to sleep when i heard a woman screaming “somebody help me”. all of my dogs were on super high alert, and i kind of froze in fear. i dont live in the best neighborhood, either. i ended up calling the police because i wouldnt have been able to sleep at night knowing i did nothing. but if this happened when i was still using meth, i can honestly say that i dont know if i wouldve called. i wouldve been extremely paranoid, not to mention there have been a few times where i’d do a really big shot and i’d start hearing things, so i wouldve been confused on whether of not it was real. all of this makes me really glad to be clean!",62,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.6212199330329895}"
