 I ll start by saying what has been up lately.

* 4 months ago i relapsed(had been clean for 5 months before this, all i used was coffee and i smoked cigs aswell).

* When i started to use again it was like 5 grams of speed a month. 
I would mix it with alcohol. (Mostly vodka, sometimes a beer)
* Sometimes i would smoke some cannabis aswell.
I only used on the weekends.
 Never used at work. 

This went on for the first 2 months. 

* The last 2 months

*  i've been buying 10grams of speed. (Which i thought that i would use only in weekends, but guess what... i starting using nights before i would be working)

* I started eating benzos again.

* I had eaten MDMA once in these 2 last months.

* And smoked more cannabis aswell.  

Now the past weekend when i went and got ""the monthly 10 grams of speed"".
 Which i was able to empty in 6 days. 
This scared me.

I have pretty good self control, but i just don't know how i could have done this.

So i am quitting everything and getting clean.
 I've decided this today. 

I was using with some weird types of users, and i just don't want to be around these people anymore.
 ( talking bout user that can't control their use)

So this is what am gonna do:

 * I will start using snus, instead of smoking cigarettes. ( have been smoking a while, but i find that snus is a lot nicer and i just want to quit the cigs)
 * I will only drink one cup of coffee in the morning if really needed. 
 * And i might drink some alcohol, but i will have a limit on how much i can drink.
 ( i will only drink on weekends, one day only, so not the whole weekend) (and i will only drink with friends)

Goals:

 * My goal is to be healthier ofcourse. 

 * I want to be able to meet new people and start doing something fun.
( find some new hobbies and learn to know myself alot better)

 * i want to be able to train alot more.

My use habits:
I used almost every day, smoking or snorting. The longest I ever went without sleep was 2 nights (day1, night1, day2, night2, day3, sleep), but usually just one night, if I was up - the VAST MAJORITY of the time, Ive been sleeping every night and eat SOMETHING every day. At first, a 10 bag could last me about a week, now I use a 20/wk.

In the past when I had to wait a few days to find a source, I mostly just felt tired and hungry. I've heard that people get fat after quitting because of all the food that they eat. I have been a fitness enthusiast for several years and am hoping I can use the weight loss to my advantage and maintain my ""lean-ness"" while getting back to my weightlifting program.
If I can maintain discipline to eat healthy and exercise regularly, could I potentially just start packing on muscle and not get fat?
Also, is being tired and hungry the only thing I need to worry about or am I going to get sick and start puking my guts out at work? Btw I am off work until Thursday night (I work nights, so that was a perfect cover for my odd hours 😉)",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.43222106}"

I just wanted to send some positive vibes out there for anyone who may be in their recovery journey and let you know that you CAN do this.

I was in denial for a long time about my addiction. I remember when I finally realized that the only thing I looked forward to in life was taking those pills. I actually looked at my pill bottle one day and thought, ""You own me."" And then I couldn't help but think, ""How sad is that?"" That was the a-ha moment when I realized how much of a problem I had. I was YEARS deep in my addiction at this point, but I had been completely in denial up until then.

Don't get me wrong - it hasn't been easy. I still crave Adderall all the time. I was prescribed Adderall for a debilitating sleep disorder, and so it has been a huge adjustment trying to live with the symptoms that Adderall helped to mitigate. However, I would rather feel sick than be a prisoner to a pill that I know will eventually kill me.

Life without Adderall is far from perfect. It's really fucking hard sometimes. But I know without a doubt that it's so much better on this side. I feel more in touch with my emotions than I ever felt on Adderall. My anxiety is back to normal and no longer crippling. I no longer have to worry about heart palpitations and whether my heart is beating too fast. I no longer freak out that I am going to die. I am no longer malnourished. I can actually connect with those around me. I am more in touch with my body and physical issues because I'm not distracted by Adderall. I can go about my day without worrying about when I can be alone to take that stupid pill. 

There is no magic bullet for recovery, but for me, running has been a tremendous lifesaver. It has made a difference more than anything else I have tried. I actually feel the runner's high sometimes, and it's wonderful to feel so great doing something that is actually healthy and good for you. 

I also have only made it this far because I told myself I was going to stop for good and I flushed my pills down the toilet.  I committed to it and I made up my mind that I was done. There's a quote I heard recently that goes something like, ""There are few things more powerful than a human mind once it's made up."" I think that's so beautiful and true.

Based on past periods of shorter lengths of abstinence, I know it's going to be very challenging in specific ways, and that having regular interaction/contact/engagement socially with other people going through similar things is a HUGE HUGE help (maybe better than any medicine).

My doctor said the amount of Adderall I was prescribed and authorized to take over several years is so high it's virtually unheard of, so he said I really need to aim for around 18 months of abstinence (based on scientific research) before expecting my dopamine system (currently depleted) to start to noticeably grow back.

I desperately hope to find other people who are interested in support one another through our journeys, especially in-person. 

I'm very fortunate to have a place/house in San Francisco that I can stay at during this period of abstinence, so I can really focus on improving my health through working consistently with the same doctors in one place, exercising a more and more (at one point this issue had be bedridden), and drastically changing my other habits like nutrition. 

I am even looking for potential roommates/housemates who might share similar goals and needs for similar lifestyle changes, to support one another during a time when I know I myself will be in a physically fragile condition (but I NEED to allow that to happen, as I need to go through it to get beyond it!). I'm lucky to have the space to potentially create a really enriching and supportive environment conducive to radical change and improvement, but I have limited spoons/energy in terms of planning it all, and the house is a bit of a fixer-upper that would require some elbow grease to get it in better shape for the first month or so (but nothing insurmountable).

TLDR: I'm looking to connect with people with similar struggles to mine (longterm high use of Adderall, and needing an extended abstinence period from stimulants in order to recover) for ideally in-person/IRL support and possibly as roommates/housemates with shared goals and lifestyle changes in San Francisco.",3,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.7351057}"

One year ago and two days ago, I arrived at rehab in New Canan, CT. A year and three days ago, I was in a hospital in Philly after overdosing on a combination of Methamphetamines and MDMA. Today, I live in Florence, Italy. I'm attending a post-baccalaureate program for fine art conservation and am working on applications for graduate school. 

The flick that switched my mindset was the realization that death was a certainty if I kept going on like I was. But there was a way for me to move forward.

My addiction started slowly and then progressed very fast over three years from alcohol and weed to psychedelics, to dissociatives, to RC stimulants, to meth and crack. In the end, I was binging and overdosing every chance I got and using downers and antipsychotics to ""get away"" with it. My friends in rehab don't know how I am still alive. Consistently, suicidally high on something. On anything. To not feel the pain of existence, the pain that was given to me, and of my own making.

That pain is often still there. But, I've gotten better at coping with it. Emotion is my fuel. 12 Step, DBT, and Buddism are my map. My support network and honest communication are the rails that carry me when things get messy. I know to keep moving forward in this sober life because this is so. Much. More. Meaningful. Than addiction. 

I attribute my sobriety to the many people who have helped me get to where I am now — my Clinician in rehab who turned me onto DBT and was patient with my panic attacks. My friends in rehab helped me feel like I could be me again. The staff at the sober house that I went to in Boulder, CO. The gay AA group that meets on Wednesdays at 7 pm. My fantastic therapist who helped me share and process some rotten experiences and actions. DBT. EMDR. The gallery that gave me a job and let me teach workshops even though only one person showed up to one of them. Ku Cha tea for keeping me caffeinated, not tweaking. My sponsor who was willing to spend hours with me talking about a higher power in light of a rough Mormon upbringing. Still, my parents helped me through this year, even though they knew what I had used. 

Have a blessed year, everyone. 

If it's not working, try something different.

May your load be lightened by the certainty of growth.

TL: DR

I’m 19m and I live in the Deep South. I’ve been on pills off and  on since 14 Xanax and oxycodone mostly. I went from sniffing percocets or taking hydrocodone to get high to pretty much only binging on roxies nowadays. For the past 2 years or so I’ve been letting my opiate tolerance get low as fuck for a few weeks or months then when I find some roxies I get high as hell for a few days. My friends hate I have the willpower to do this but it’s honestly not fucking easy and I always have to second guess most my decisions since addiction is a sneaky mofo. 

I’ve tried every major drug besides heroin, pcp,ketamine,ghb, and peyote which I’m not trying to brag I’m just letting you know how fucking wild my head can get sometimes with all the cravings or emotions, I feel like years of drugs use have really thrown my emotions way out of wack. 

I’ve decided to finally stop to better myself and to stick around for the people who love me, I know this sounds crazy but I’ve been to rehab and I’ve had councilors, been arrested, and nothing made me want to change. I had been binging on meth, oxycodone, and Xanax for 2 days straight and the comedown I got was so bad all I could do was think about how bad I’m ruining my life, I feel like I was at the point where my parents had a 90% chance of outliving me by a long shot and that was a scary realization. The first step I feel like was blocking all connections with my meth plug, which I really haven’t told many people about since my friends think I’m just a goofy stoner and I’d hate for them to know I fucked up. My meth plug told me he just got his re up, so I thought about it for maybe 30 seconds then cut off all contact. I’ve been over a week sober now, all by choice since I’ve been offered drugs and have money for the drugs but I’m just done for now. 

I know 1 week sober isn’t much but you have to start somewhere. Has anyone successfully gotten clean from a similar situation, where you felt like you’ve had enough and decided to leave this life behind? The one thing that scared me was how I always heard “meth can get you addicted on your first try” I always thought that was some anti drug bs but no, meth is really that fucking intense and I don’t even really like uppers besides coke.

Last night I had to give my best friend my pouch that I keep everything in because I was so spun out I felt like I was going to die but I just kept smoking. This morning I was getting ready for work, and he came into the bathroom, looked me in the eyes, and just said ""Please, please stop refilling the container."" I said I know...this isn't a little problem...I have a really, huge problem dude. I've been saying it's going to be the last time for three months. Every single time I get low, I re-up before I even run out. When I think about quitting I am filled with dread, fear, panic, anger, sadness, EMPTINESS, the list goes on. I don't even know how to think about not using. I know that I am absolutely out of control, I am literally ALWAYS high, I can't remember the last time I wasn't. Today I made an appointment for Wednesday at my counties mental health services office and I'm going to go. I am sick of living this life. I want to do better but I'm scared to try because I don't want to fail. This is the end though. I am going to go get evaluated professionally, and I'm going to get the help I need. I don't plan on stopping right away because I'm afraid if I'm this serious and I relapse, I'm going to not actually try ""Next time"". My plan is to get help to cope with my childhood, I need to find someone who can give me guidance on forgiveness, coping mechanisms, and just an honest outside perspective at times. I am going to go into this honest about my addiction. Even though I'm not going to stop using immediately, I am going to gather the tools I need to be able to stop. I am really nervous but kind of excited. This is me finally taking my first step to recover; and by fucking god I am going to do it.",17,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.67542356}"

But it was killing me, it took everything I had and just didn’t stop. I’m still in the mind of an addict(opposite of addiction is connection and I seem to be lacking that). Anyway, I snapped on one of my roommates. I thought going for a run at the gym would help but it didn’t. I burned 1200 calories and came back and was just PISSED. I yelled at one of them over food bs and I don’t even know anymore. I just want the cravings to go away. I feel ugly both on the outside and inside without speed. I lost my sense of humor and confidence for a high I can no longer even feel. That high that Vyvanse gave me was above and beyond anything I was getting in the real world and it simply consumed me. It was far more than me needing to stay up all night for work. I just wanted a friend.

I can't sustain motivation toward any particular goal besides staying high for more than a few days. Recovery requires sustained motivation for more then a few days. What do I do?,"I've been stuck in the recovery/relapse cycle with meth for the better of 10 years. Early on I could get up to a year clean, with a few 9 month stretches and several 6 months as well. I was never great at putting in work but at least back then I could attend meetings every day and maintain some sort of contact with a sponsor.

Since early 2018 I haven't been able to get more than 3 months, with relapses lasting 2 weeks or less. It always gets ugly fast, I usually lose housing or my job if I have one and by the time I'm ready to get clean I'm really, really sure that I want something better for my life. But a few weeks or a month into recovery even though I know hitting a meeting or calling my sponsor or taking whatever suggestions is conducive to my recovery and well being and sitting around or doing whatever it is I want to do instead is not, I don't do the recovery stuff.


What I'm really hoping for is to hear from someone who's felt the same way and broken through it. How did you organize your life so that recovery became the thing you wanted to do, or else how did you train yourself to focus on long term goals when you lacked the motivation to do so?

I had hit a wall with life and was feeling horrendously tired and unmotivated. Now I realize it was probably just stress and early depression. But my doctor took my symptoms, diagnosed me with adhd, and sent me on my way with some new meds.

At first it was amazing. Work was interesting again, I was pushing out projects left and right, I finished remodeling my home, and everything was great.

Then, 2 years in it stated giving me awful anxiety. I became more anxious about every little thing - stuff I had never been anxious about before. I was terrified of being wrong or doing something wrong constantly. I was incredibly self conscious all the time and spent an hour just picking what to wear. I was suddenly afraid of spending time with family and friends. I never felt good enough and was always looking for things to make me feel ""included"" - clothes, furniture, decor, shoes, etc. I just shut myself off from the world around me and grew so, so cynical.

At that point, it didn't dawn on me that it was the meds. They were my life support. Without them, I was afraid I would just fall asleep at any moment or wouldn't be able to function in any capacity.

A few months ago, we moved across the country to a beautiful city with so many outdoor opportunities. With the move, I lost my insurance and wouldn't get it back for months. So, my meds ended.

I was terrified of being without them. I would bargain with myself at the end, splitting one over a course of three days just to hang on.

But one day, I didn't have anymore. And I was OK. Soon, a week had passed and I was still OK.

I started noticing things.

* my jaws didn't clench so as much
* I slept so much better (solid 8 hours)
* I could enjoy coffee again without worrying about my heart 
* I was able to sit still and relax for the first time in forever
* I could go hiking or biking or walking or do anything without constant worrying
* I relaxed on the cleanliness of my house and stopped spending hours and hours on chores on my days off
* I stopped believing I had to be perfect all the time
* I stopped crying so often 
* I stopped being so angry and irritated 
* I didn't crave cigarettes like I had before and was able to quit 
* I wanted to reconnect with people again 
* I became empathetic and positive again 

I didn't know the meds contributed to a lot of these things. I spent way too long in a constant state of worry and panic and anger and am done.

I don't work any better or worse than I did when I was on them. Maybe a little slower, but that's OK, I never needed to work faster anyways. That was what I told myself when I was on them - faster, better, more perfect. 

Now, I don't worry about that anymore and am so much happier.

Well I got promoted to a directors level and then demand and pace increased. I take my work home with me- I have to. Like today, I’ve worked 13 hours. On a Saturday. 

I started taking more and more to stay sharp and alert- at the slightest sign of coming down/getting tired- i would redose. 

Well now, I’m dosing far more than I need to... and to make the whole situation even more fucked is:

I just got promoted to Interim CEO (I am standing CEO of the hospital until they find a permanent one). 

This goes effective next Friday. But I’m on the edge of spiraling. I have a 30 day supply, but at my current rate of use it’ll be gone in 15 days. 

I want to get off of it- and I have 4 days until this takes effect. 

HOW do I cope with the brain fog? HOW do I cope with the lack of motivation to do something as simple is pick up my phone when it rings? 

If I could take a whole 7 days off I know I could pull out of this and be clear minded on the other side past the negatives. 

In my situation should I taper? Cut from 90mgs to 40mgs immediately and then just deal with it, and then tape to 20 and so on? 

I don’t know what to do- I’m scared because my mind is even going to “well I can just buy some meth, and dose it in 10-20mg increments until I can have some time off and then I’ll just Quit”

Relapsed after two years, and my life got...better?","Edit: Before you read this, I want to clarify that I am absolutely NOT encouraging anyone to do what I did. Ive been beating myself up over it ever since it happened, but I've had these voices fighting in my head with rationalizations ever since. I'm extremely scared. If you're sober from stimulants, especially if you're early on in the process and have doubts on staying sober, I would absolutely say **STAY SOBER**. Take everything im saying with a grain of salt. Every mind is different and unique. 


I know some of you will relate to this, and I really need to get this off my chest and talk about options with some people.  


I've been on amphetamines my whole life - middle school, high school, college.

I couldn't afford my prescriptions due to not having health insurance anymore, and ended up doing 20mg oral meth daily for a while. I got caught, went to rehab, and was two years sober until last week.  


Those two years were some of the worst of my life. I felt like I couldn't do a single thing. I couldn't clean, I just barely got through work, I was irritable, and I just wasn't happy with who I was. When I was on amphetamines, I was extremely happy of myself and what it helped me do.  


My apartment was such a mess, and I couldn't bring myself to clean it. I was a slob, and hating my life every single day. I relapsed by buying a gram of meth, weighed out 25mg doses, put them in caps, and took one. My ""plan"" was to only take it when absolutely necessary, when i just needed that clarity and focus. That day, I cleaned my entire apartment, was more productive then I've ever been in my entire life, got back into wonderful habits and was overall being much more healthy then I've ever been (I was actually brushing my teeth, I was actually taking showers, I was extremely loving to my girlfriend, everything just seemed kind of perfect.)  


But still, the thought that I ruined two years of sobriety tore me apart that day. I flushed all of the meth, and haven't done it since that one single dose. But I can't stop thinking about what I need to make my life more like what it was that day. I'm proud i flushed all of it, and even the next two days i still felt productive and motivated without the drug. Residual effects, or something.

 If you can't tell, I have absolutely horrible ADD. When off stimulants, I was drinking daily and self loathing. That lasted two years. Finally having it taken away for one day was so cathartic. I realized I'm not a horrible human being and have worth, have the ability to function and be happy, etc.  


What the hell should I do? I talked to my girlfriend about this, confessed everything, and she was brought up that if I could potentially get prescribed amphetamines for my ADD, that she'd control my usage and would hold the bottle, give me my dose daily, and not allow me to abuse it. I thought that was a good idea, but still, I don't think I can get that. I haven't been prescribed it in two years, and I wouldn't even know where to begin as I'm in a new state now. My health insurance runs out in two months.   


I'm just so conflicted. I need to clarify here that I hate methamphetamine. I hate it's ""more-ish"" feeling when not done orally, which is why I limited my ""relapse"" to such a small oral dose. I was just scared that it would get out of control, as it almost always does when it comes to that drug. I just didn't let it happen.  


Can anyone relate at all? Can anyone give me some advice on what I should do?  


I'm sorry for the wall of text. I've been thinking about this non-stop for the past week. I just want to be happy, functional, and motivated again.

It's also worth pointing out that on my main account, I've always been a part of this community. Always helping people who relapsed through it, especially the hard users, but now i just feel kind of phony. I think I separate myself from the large-dose users but im not sure if thats really fair. Meth, as a drug, is absolutely horrible in my mind. But I've just found myself lately adding ""when abused"" after that thought.",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.58576167}"

I am a 20 year old female from the midwest and I am 53 days sober from meth. it’s been pretty fucking hard. I’ve been attending AA with my best friend, who is an alcoholic. It helps some. 

My thoughts are pretty scattered so I apologize for the rant-y nature of this post. I barely remember the withdrawal from meth. i’m pretty sure all I did was sleep for days. its mostly been a totally mental thing. I wish that I had a brutal ass withdrawal from meth so it wouldn’t still tempt me so. I think about meth every single day. Will the rumination ever stop? I don’t know. I feel like meth was the only thing that ever made me truly happy. I have very severe ADHD so for me, meth made my brain finally shut the fuck up and truly concentrate. That silence... it haunts me. It almost was like an illicit cure for my fucked up brain. I think that was the main appeal of it. Then, as I started to lose weight, that definitely was an appeal too.

I am also bipolar and right before I discovered meth, I was in the worst depressive episode i’ve ever been in. Meth skyrocketed me into mania. it still calls to me because i’ve returned to my depressive episode. Like “hey dude come back.. I gotchu... I can do everything and more”. while I was in a constantly chaotic environment while using, my addiction has made it so that that fact doesn’t even matter. Like I could be happy and confident and funny and skinny and be able to concentrate again and it doesn’t even matter that I was hangin around in dope houses and everyone was screaming at each other and the entire atmosphere could change at the drop of a pin. 

Feeling a little discouraged right now. I’ve accepted the fact that I’ll relapse at some point. Which is bad. I know that it’s bad for me but it’s like it doesn’t even matter.

Its like i get my hopes up and my families hopes and i screw up and let everyone down. Shame is a big factor right now as well. 
           The single biggest reason why i can't stay sober is because of my borderline personality disorder. Basically, I have the same issues as a bipolar depressive person, except the moodswings are rapid cylcing.. Like multiple times a day instead of weeks or months long. Also, it can't be treated with medication.. I was on psych meds for 15 years. Every pill, until finally a correct diagnosis was made and i understood why i was medication resistant.
            When my depression hits, its unbearable. I self harmed daily for 12 years to cope with the pain when drugs were inaccessible. Idk how in the world to cope with that despair that has become my well worn path to relapse. Sorry for the lengthly post and the self pity as well. Im afraid and i just want some kind of advice or support.
            No one knows I'm a daily IV meth user. I isolate from my family and no longer speak with them, people at work dont know either. So i cant open up to anyone and continue my charade, thus i have reached out on reddit. Please share anything helpful here, it is greatly appreciated.",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.9220848}"

so i was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult 19 Months ago and was prescribed rital XR. 

And the medication was sooooo helpful! 

I stopped forgetting everything

i could manage my temper

i could think straight, clear headed.....1 thought after the other

had a lot more selfmotivation

&#x200B;

Then i started to abuse my medication + alcohol in a phase of severe Depression for about 4 Months.

I went sober from alcohol to this day and stopped getting my prescription for ritalin because i could not handle it like i should.

But now in my day to day life (still fight Depression) i miss the benefits so much.

The thought of fucking the medication up for my self is crushing and fills me with a lot of guilt.

&#x200B;

The first time i took my medication was such a relief! 

And now its gone forever, because i fucked it up.

&#x200B;

I tried venlaflaxine and Wellbutrin and both helped a little with the ADHD symptoms but pale in comparison.

And now a couple days ago, i had the chance to try Meth and i took the chance....

&#x200B;

And i did not even liked it very much, a lot of anxiety, high was ok but comedown was hard (2 full blown Panic attacks)

But i did the same on Meth as i did on Alcohol +ritalin....fapping for 12 hours straight.

&#x200B;

So yeah....still Even i didn't liked it that much and the negatives way outweighed the positives i ordered 1g again from the DNM yesterday...because i craved it.

I instantly regretted the decision and asked the vendor to cancel the order, but he didn't and shipped it anyway. So it will arrive tomorrow or Wednesday. 

&#x200B;

So any tips to cope with the loss of ADHD Symptom relief for the rest of my life?

&#x200B;

And a strategies to be strong enough to take the meth and flush it down the instant it arrives?

2019-10-13 21:04:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/dhjcvz/adderall_withdrawl/,Adderall withdrawl," Greetings, I've been lurking here for about a week or so. This is my throw away account.


Let me begin, I was always a very hyperactive kid and couldn't focus on school stuff and that led me to around 4th grade being diagnosed with ADHD and put on Ritalin, I didn't take it for long because I didn't like it because I had trouble being able to run and play, so I'm told...


Fast forward, I'm now in my mid 30s and have been on adderall XR and the regular adderall for about 3 years: 15mg XR am and 15 of the regular around noon. I have never really abused the prescription with the exception of probably a dozen times in the past year and a half where I've taken an extra pill to stay up all night at work and pull a double shift after already working a full (or even extended) shift, my job offers me near unlimited overtime and I wear myself down to the bone chasing their money... I have bills and hobbies and a credit card that has a hefty balance and I've been juggling my responsibilities between work, being a single dad and my girlfriend and trying to have time for myself too. I'm an outdoors kinda guy, physical worker, enjoy building stuff even if it's labor intensive, I just keep going and pushing on and that's likely the same thing that put my dad into an early grave. We have a hard time stopping once we get going and unfortunately that extends to drinking too.


I usually get around 6-7 hours of sleep during the work week although that's my stipulation to myself now as I used to get up around 4am after going to bed around 12am... 


Well, I've felt like ass lately even with the adderall and decided to stop taking the morning XR. I was adjusting to only doing the regular adderall and then cut down to half every other day and I was tired and unenergetic but work was slow and I dragged myself around but then work started to pick up and I did two 60 hour weeks by after working Friday during the day, taking a cat nap for about an hour and then going back on Friday night around 11pm and working a full 16 hours until 3pm the next day and then going to bed at 9 or 10pm, essentially awake for around 40 hours and then sleeping for 10-12 hours and trying to go on like I didn't just add a whole damn day by taking an extra adderall to get through the night AND I was taking the XR that I had stopped taking late in August! 

The past two weeks have really sucked. I was extremely exhausted, weak, often uneasy on my feet, nodding off on break or just sitting at my desk. I have a busy work job and I have a desk for doing paperwork and stuff and other than that or maybe eating I NEVER sit there because I've always been a busy body worker. Sit down but maybe get bored right away or maybe sit and then think of stuff to do and go do it but I've find myself unable to bring myself to do aspects of my job. I found myself taking a whole adderall 15mg everyday for a week versus the half every other day because I couldn't function and I still had extreme difficulties. I didn't want to be at work anyway and found myself just sitting at my desk at times just staring at nothing and nodding off, wanting to just lay on the floor.


This weekend is a 4 day weekend for me and I've been able to get down to 1/2 a pill once a day again. The 1 pill a day had given me a temporary energy boost during the day and would get me talkative but within a few hours I was burnt out again. Today was the first day I felt really good and was able to clean my house and take a small hike and get food cooked and lunches prepped for the next few days and I'm hoping it continues to go favorably. I got some ginseng from the store to try to help with my energy levels. I'm going to continue to get as much resting and relaxing in until Tuesday, that's been the main thing I've wanted to do, just sit and chill and be left relatively alone and then all mad at life's responsibilities and my lack of time for myself and basically the ""i don't wanna move or do anything"" with life's responsibilities going ""BUT YOU GOTTA!""... If that makes sense...


I guess TL;DR: 

Didn't really abuse adderall, took mostly as prescribed for three years and having a hell of an energy crash with the withdrawals and trying to continue to taper off and get better and fully off of adderall.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.47072196}"

It laid pathetically on the floor in my room for about 2 months before I picked it back up, and I gave up on it at least 5 separate times. But I FINALLY finished it just now.

This has  been the biggest challenge for me in recovery, since art was (and continues to be) a way of life for me. If I don't enjoy making art, I don't really know what there is to live for.  

At first, I had pretty severe carpal tunnel from drawing and painting for 20+ hours at a time so it would be legitimately painful to paint and that made me really upset. I had to lay off of it for a while to let my wrist and shoulders heal and stop frustrating myself... however, I resolved to not let meth rob me of my joy of painting. I was making art long before I ever met meth and I will continue to do so long after. Anyways, I dunno if anyone else relates to this at all, but I'm super satisfied with the way this painting came out, and I think I'm gonna hang it up on my wall to remind myself to never give up and what's possible with recovery. My art when I was addicted was absolute TRASH yet I, somehow, thought I needed it to draw. Lol.

But instead of smoking it, I said “I’m glad I don’t smoke that shit anymore” and then took it to the sink and ran water through it, dissolving all the meth and pouring it down the drain.

I was not ready to quit yet.

Today about 6 hours after a small dose, I suddenly felt lightheaded, short of breath and just generally weird.  It quickly spiraled to chest pressure and pains, pressure in the arteries in my neck, and feeling like I was going to pass out.  I’ve had milder versions of these symptoms on occasion, but this was quite terrifying (and no it was not just a panic attack).  I couldn’t do anything for a couple hours except hope it would pass and debate if I should try to get to a hospital somehow, while I willed myself to stay conscious. This morning I had no plans to stop, and now that this was happening I told myself I had to.

All the time, I convince myself that this drug is the thing that will get my life together even though some quieter part of me knows it’s the other way around. There are SO many reasons to quit: other health issues, looking haggard, dropping the ball at work if I even have it, flaking on family when they need me, my rapidly declining memory and shrinking lexicon, all the time I’ve wasted searching for shit, using it, coming down, quitting (usually not voluntarily) and starting all over again, etc.

I’m so scared that I will start again. That’s why I wasn’t ready to quit. I wasn’t ready to say I’m done with this forever. When I finally thought I was dying earlier I was ready to say it. It’s not fucking worth it. I’m on my way to a heart attack or stroke or something. 

But now as I write this and my heart palpitations gradually fade, I have so many doubts. 

I know that the shame and drama and highs and lows of this lifestyle outweigh the gray, meaningless world of early sobriety.  I know that after a few months sober, I’ll be on the right track and get complacent and ready to fuck it all up again like I always do. And I know that I only really started doing drugs because I didn’t want to live in the first place! Ironic how now I must stop so I don’t die.

I guess there are fates worse than death if I continue.

I would love to quit. But I have no trust in myself. I have no local friends except a couple who use.  Not much to speak of for support. I’ve quit before when losing connects. Not so hard then. When I do have a source though? Well I don’t quit. 

I don’t know how to make this work. I haven’t ever been successful at much. I have very little diligence even though I try—another irony, that’s why I keep picking up this shit. It actually makes me feel like I can accomplish things. I know if I don’t stop now things are only going to get worse but that thought really doesn’t sink in, compared to the thought of giving up the one thing that makes you feel how you think “normal” non-depressed/anxious people feel. 

Thanks for reading. Sorry for all the negativity; I hope for those of you sober this serves as a reminder of the despair and just general shite felt when using.  You’d think that would be enough to stop me.  I really do want to. I’m so afraid that when this lingering chest pain fades, my resolve will go with it.",14,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.88866043}"

This is my life now.,"I'm 27 and I was addicted to addies for 3 years, on and off. My most recent stint lasted for four months, where it was at my worst - taking 60mg+, staying up until morning stimfapping for 12+ hours (I know, wtf?), missing work/going to work as a zombie, etc. I was a shell of my former self. I got constant heart pains and I was so depressed all the time. I'd eat one meal a day and never drink water.


But enough about how shitty it was. After a night of binging and missing work, I flushed 50+ pills down the toilet.


I'm 1 month clean today, again. But this time, I am never turning back. I've seen the real evils of addiction, and my heart goes out to those recovering. It's very difficult to understand addiction until you're a victim of it. It's easy to look at those who are addicted as weak, instead of people who were pushed or stumbled, and need a helping hand.


I've been running 2 miles after work each day, and I love seeing the sunset while I run in the autumn weather. It's my favorite part of the day, and it makes me feel like a kid playing outside again.


After I run, I feel like a god. I go shower and then have 3-4 hours to spend. I get right to my passions/hobbies. Sometimes it's making beats for hours. Sometimes it's playing new Nintendo games that came out - something I did religiously when I was younger. Sometimes I read a book and code something I'm interested in. I smoke weed, but I changed to vaping only - and I plan to quit after I finish my current sack. Alcohol is very rare now.


I stock up on healthy organic foods and go to the farmer's market every week. I eat fruits throughout the day - blueberries, mandarins, bananas, strawberries, grapes, etc. I just spent $30 on fruits. I bought fuckin chia seeds to put in my water every morning. I bought mixed nuts to snack on. My diet is the cleanest it's ever been, and I can fucking FEEL the difference. My shits are fucking amazing and come out in one giant log. My libido is way less now, but slowly getting back to my normal self. It scares me how strong my boners can get now with no effort (sign of good heart health). 


Quitting addies and cleaning my diet.. I get better sleep - and I wake up at 5:30AM every morning feeling great. And I love seeing the sunrise. I've also been getting to work on time now. I wake up kind of sleepy, but it's nothing to me since I know what it's like to go to work everyday with 0-3 hours of sleep.


Most importantly.. I'm actually happy. I don't ""snap"" on people I care about. I'm comfortable joking and talking with co-workers and shit at work. My belly is going away and I'm able to see my abs now (I heard addies slows metabolism).


I went to the dentist to get some LONG overdue fillings. I'm flossing everyday and taking care of my teeth, and trying to whiten them too.


You guys can do it too, I promise. I get cravings sometimes (I was so tempted to call my doc up again) but if you just wait they go away after 15 minutes (best advice I got here on reddit).

I quit and walked away 2x for 30 days from my meds. Then told myself I need them because of work piling up.

But I’ve opened a can I can’t put a lid back on- I crossed a line with dosing myself however I felt needed dosing. 90 days and going back on- well who’s to say 20mgs doesn’t “feel” like enough and I’m back at 60-70mgs?

If my new Vyvanse Rx 70MG = less than 1/2 the ""Stimulant equivalency"" of my prior Adderall dose 60MG yet peers are warning me Vyvanse 70MG could be more intense w/ more neg. side effects!","I had an appt. w/ my psychiatrist yesterday and he said it's time to try something different because I had been exceeding my already-likely-too-high-for-me Adderall dose of 60MG/day, and we were TRYING to ultimately taper off it in the near future. 

He suggested we try Vyvanse which I had never been prescribed before but had had recommended to me as an alternative a few times in the past, so I was very open to it.

Anyway, I said I had heard or read that there were concrete numbers for comparing the effects of the different ADHD stimulant meds, and asked what the equivalent in Adderall MG's the Vyvanse dose he was going to prescribe me (70MG) would equal, and my psychiatrist said it would equal about 30MG of Adderall. 

Based on my (clearly flawed?) understanding of these conversion or stimulant equivalency charts/tables, I thought I was actually going to be taking a significant step DOWN with this new 70MG Vyvanse prescription.

Indeed, my psychiatrist's estimate of about 30MG Adderall equivalency is confirmed by the convertors/calculators that seem quite prevalent out on the internet. (e.g. [http://www.adhdmedcalc.com](http://www.adhdmedcalc.com), [http://www.uacap.org/uploads/3/2/5/0/3250432/stimulant\_equivalency.pdf](http://www.uacap.org/uploads/3/2/5/0/3250432/stimulant_equivalency.pdf))

HOWEVER, my peers here seemed to be genuinely surprised I would be prescribed such a high dose of Vyvanse, and suggested that 70MG Vyvanse could easily be more intense and result in more negative side effects! I was truly caught off guard. I totally respect the folks because they are basing it off experience and seemed to be genuinely concerned. But I truly thought I was essentially cutting my dose of stimulants in half with this switch, so I'm seriously confused and sincerely hoping someone could kindly **\*explainlikeimfive\*** what exactly I'm not understanding or misunderstanding??

Fast forward to the last couple days... i find myself desperately trying to score while doing security at my work site(shameful I know, among many things im not proud of) i wander off when i got the chance and came across some homeless. Ive done this many times when i dont have a connect. One of the couple is shooting up his daily dose behind a dumpster. They didnt have clean needles for me to use and no way im sharing. But i manage to score some crystal for the night. Havent had much sleep the last couple nights let alone food,  and continually redosing, i was in terrible shape. All night into the day when i got home all i did was snort and smoke over and over, but i wasnt happy. Not even euphoric as I remembered it to be. I dont even know why i was doing it, why i was so desperate, why i was so helpless. Ive let drugs wreck my life and it will take everything i have left away too if i dont stop. I noticed later in the day a weird sensation in my chest. It literally felt like my heart was jumping out. Like a strong tug on it every few seconds. Kinda scary but i kept doing more regardless. I was powerless. Completely out of control. Throughout last night, i prayed for help, for a way out, for guidance out of this nightmare. I may have been an atheist for a number of years but after multiple overdoses and occurrences, im beginning to ask for help from a greater force. I cant do this alone. I need help.

I believe God has a plan for me, and I believe drugs mask who I really am, and knock me off God’s intended path. It’s not easy to quit, to give up the hyper-productivity, the accolades, the relentless work ethic that beats everyone else out. But at the end of the day, what am I left with? What am I selling my soul for? I have come to realize my outputs and the “rewards” for what I falsely believe is some super impressive work are actually not that great after all. Not to mention the anxiety, depression, sleeplessness and insane rebound hunger I am left to deal with when the pills wear off. I love who I am when I’m not on adderall - funny, caring, empathetic, goofy, always laughing and seeing the bright side.
