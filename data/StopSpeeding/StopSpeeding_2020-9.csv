I'm a software engineer for one of the FAANG companies and I can't bring myself to stop taking adderall. I started when I was in college and now I feel bound to the little blue bastards.

When I'm not speeding I feel useless and dumb.
I constantly fear failing and feel like an imposter.

I've started taking modafinil alongside my adderall usage to speed me up even more. I have been overeating and not sleeping enough.

Do you have any advice, books to read, or anything really, to help me kick the addiction?

If you read all of the above, I really appreciate your time and hope you're doing well.",8

I’ve been having panic attacks the past couple days in regards to the damage I’ve done to my heart. I started low prescribed to adderall like everyone does but have been prescribed to it for 8 years now and after it stopped working there were days im not going to lie I took up to 150 mgs in a 24 hr period. 120 mg was my usual though. 2 months ago I finally realized I wasn’t doing this anymore. In the past now almost 3 months I have not taken more than 60 mgs. Some even none or less. But now that I am coming out of that mental fog it places you in I am beyond petrified of the damage it has done to my heart. Last night it felt like my heart was racing, today it feels like its fluttering. I haven’t taken any. Im done with it. I can’t do this anymore. I’m 30, and I have a 10 year old boy who needs me to be here and I’m so scared I’m just going to drop dead any day. Can someone please give me some insight and hopefully telling me the damage is reversible??? I also smoked cigarettes this whole time but with that I am also sending them out the door too.

Looking through old messages on reddit, I came across a thread I started on this sub a year ago seeking help on how to handle my husband's meth addiction.... I got some great advice and PMs and I thought I'd share a message of hope, recovery is possible. 


My husband (I have his permission to share) is an alcoholic and addict, he had been drinking heavily since the age of 16, spent years in prison, and ended up turning to meth, fentanyl, heroin, and whatever else he could get his hands on. I spent years trying to convince him to get treatment, he tried IOP, intensive outpatient, inpatient rehab, and 12 step but nothing stuck and he always left AMA or quit. Last year, after 9 jobs and months of unemployment, I had had enough so I sought the help of strangers and people who have been through it. I was told I was codependent, which I was, and that I needed to stop enabling him, which I did. I gave him a choice and we found a rehab together and he checked in that night. He ended up leaving after 7 days of detox which was enough to get him over the hump and he has been sober ever since. He has found the right programs, a sponsor, and mental peace with meditation. He is now working again and our relationship is better than it has ever been. 


So, thank you kind strangers who took the time to share your thoughts and guidance. Much love to you all! 


For the addict that is still suffering, you are loved and help is out there, don't ever give up!",59

2020-09-27 14:10:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/j0vrxl/weed_and_sobriety/,Weed and sobriety,"So I used to be a stoner. Then later in life I got hooked on meth for a couple of years. I gave up weed completely because it didn't mix well with the meth :-( and now I have been clean from meth for 16 months. But I'm back on the marijuana because I really firmly find it helpful for my anxiety.

Now I've been going around telling people that I'm clean 16 months and they're all proud of me and stuff but I made the mistake of talking about weed on Facebook and some of the people in my life have started a rumor that I relapsed.

Now most of my Facebook friends are people out of town from my old life before meth and my current most recent Facebook friends are people from my church and homeless Outreach Services. I think one of them saw me talking about weed on Facebook because I don't hide that fact about myself. 

But whoever saw it consider that a relapse and address my boyfriend about it. He's not on Facebook and hasn't even seen the post. I shouldn't have to keep My weed usage in the closet. Church and Outreach people are my current support network because I got rid of all of my methamphetamine friends. I don't really know why I'm posting this except to vent frustration. I don't want to have to create different privacy groups Facebook just to talk about my life and I don't want to remove those people from my friends list either I just want them to not freak out when I talk about smoking a joint. 

I hate it when people think that meth and weed are on the same level. Yeah I'm still self medicating ...yes you could call it a substance use disorder too...but am I stealing things from people? Am I getting in fights? Am I taking apart all the Electronics and appliances and not putting them back together? Am I driving 90 miles an hour down the highway? Am I having psychotic episodes and losing my identity? Am I going for days without sleep? Am I losing 30 pounds in a month? Am I curled up naked in a ball on the floor in a puddle of broken glass and my own urine? Am I picking tonsil stones and impacted bowels out of my body? No! 

Self-medicating with weed has helped me stay with my caseworker and stay with my therapist and stay in the housing program and now I'm in a motel room waiting on a free apartment.I have not relapse. Grumble.

Anyway some people may view all drugs the same. But I'm one of those people who think weed is just not something to worry about nowhere near the level of the heroin and meth crisis cases that I've seen right in front of my face during my time as a homeless person.",47

Somehow reached the point of needing 30+ mg of adderall to not fall asleep (actually have adhd and lower doses make me sleepy) and due to heavy course schedule, working everyday in a fast paced high stress work environment, and my own stupidity, I was taking upwards of 70mg a day. 

today I went to work without adderall only using caffeine and although I was not sleepy as hell, my adhd was on max. I still have to work at max productivity for 3 days (research paper I have to complete and an exam the day after) 

Am I just going to have to power through this with ungodly amounts of caffeine? after 3 days I can sleep this off and return to prescribed dosing when my script is filled again, but caffeine only works to keep me awake at the cost of being geeked with nervous energy.

2020-09-26 03:09:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/j01gg9/another_demon_of_recovery_fits_of_shame/,Another Demon of Recovery: Fits of Shame,"I’m in recovery from three different substances. If I’m honest with myself, the first signs I would eventually have problems with alcohol started as early as eighteen, though the “problem drinking” didn’t really start until I was about twenty-three, and ramped up hard from twenty-four through twenty-eight (with fits of relapse for the four years thereafter). My problems with Vyvanse only lasted from last September through this May. The final Vyvanse binge that threw me into the emergency room coincided with heavy marijuana use, though I never really had a “marijuana phase.”

The real point is that I’ve had a bad relationship with substances for over a decade now (I’m thirty-two), and I’m realizing that it was right around the time I started developing those problems that my life started going to shit, at first slowly, and then faster and faster. I can’t tell you the number of people I’ve alienated over the past decade. At every turn I told myself that it was them, that somehow, through some insane statistical anomaly, I simply got wronged, betrayed, or abandoned by person after person, and that I was more or less always in the right.

One of the ugliest psychological aspects of recovery, I’m learning, is having to entertain seriously the idea that if there was an exodus of important people from my life, and if I’ve had such a hard time making deep connections in the past years, the problem has probably been me.

One difficulty is that I can never determine in what proportion the things I’ve done in the past decade were a result of the substance abuse and in what proportion they were just representations of what an ugly person I can be. And really: very few of us became addicts because we were happy and self-confident and well loved to begin with. What if I’m just kind of an asshole?

Cause and effect gets tricky here. Life gets hard so you abuse substances and then abusing substances makes life harder. You alienate people by doing stupid things when you’re hurt or high and then you do more stupid things because you’re hurt or high because you’ve been alienated.

Honestly, I really do still think there are times I was wronged, seriously wronged in the past decade. I have a lot of pent up anger and indignation that I have no real outlet for. People saw I was hurting and kicked me when I was down—people, no less, who flatter themselves that they’re good and caring and charitable, but who turn tail the second you become a liability.

But even though I’m quite certain I was wronged in some instances, I more or less have to accept that if my substance abuse had even the tiniest part in what happened, then I have to take responsibility. I simply can’t ignore the fact I started getting drastically less popular around the time I started drinking and experimenting with other substances.

The social aspect of recovery is also difficult. Now more than ever I need social support, but a lot of people don’t extend to addicts the charity they might extend to people going through other struggles. Shame really does adhere strongly to addiction, and I’m staggered by how powerful that feeling can be. I can hardly concentrate sometimes I’m so overwhelmed by unwanted memories of things I did and by how I imagine others feel about me. My day is a marathon of imaginary arguments with people I haven’t seen in years.

My current attitude is that my next few years may simply not be that enjoyable and that I should just look forward to having my health back, getting my finances in order, and slowly rebuilding a social life. I regret not having been more forward-looking in high school, for instance. I was an awkward gay kid; if I had just worked hard and told myself that my real life would start when I turned eighteen, then I could have done my undergrad at a university where I fit in better, and people probably would have respected me more for working hard rather than trying desperately to be liked.

Now, I’m telling myself, it’s the same: I’m not going to attract anyone by saying, “Hey, I know I was an asshole for the past decade, but I’m sober now, so please pretend that everything I did was the result of the substances and that I’m actually a newborn angel.” I’m trying to keep faith that if I work hard, stay sober, play the long game, and pull my head out of my ass, the universe might fling some nice things my way.",10

Went to my ""Adderall doctor""  and got a script today. Since then I've been popping Adderalls for the last 12 hours. Probably taken around 120 mg in that time period.

I know I need to throw my pills away and get sober again but I have a few important work things coming up in the next 4 days that I need to be awake and present for. If I throw away my pills right now I am really scared I will just sleep through my work appointments during the comedown. I am meeting a client in less than 48 hours and I don't know what to do, if I should just Adderall myself up for the next 4 days and then stop after that or quit right now and be at high risk for missing important work stuff because I will sleep so much and/or just be super out of it.

 I am meeting my therapist tomorrow; I told her I relapsed and I don't want to get back to my old habits again. I want this to be a short-lived relapse but now that I've been consistently popping 15mg tablets it will take at least 48 hours to be semi-functioning. Also I have Lunesta to help me sleep which is good. The smart thing to do would be to taper so that I'm functioning for work but not on crazy amounts/tweaking out, but I have no control when it comes to Adderall. I am all or nothing when it comes to this drug and it would be very hard for me to control my dosing so that I'm functional but not visibly tweaking. Anyone have any advice on coming down over a few days so that you can function while not taking insanely high amounts? Also I really only told one person I had relapsed and he is not in a position to ""ration"" them for me so it would have to be just me doing this for the next 4 days until my work commitments are finished.",4

If it's something like coke or meth, that is definitely not okay and I encourage you to stop using those as soon as possible. But when it comes to things like ADHD medications (which is primarily what I am referring to here), is being dependent on them really something you should be ashamed of? They are prescription medications meant for aiding a variety of things (way more than just ADHD), or at least, that's how Adderall helps me when I take it. It lifts my depression, any ounce of misery I have, and makes me feel so grateful and appreciative for others and everything around me. I feel like it puts me in a much more mature mindset, as well as makes me more confident. And that's on top of the fact that it helps me focus and get shit done! And yes, in case you are wondering, I am prescribed it. Do I depend on it immensely? Yes, I do. I can admit that. But I'm not necessarily ashamed of it. I would argue that being prescribed something like Adderall is no different from someone being prescribed a pair of glasses. Adderall = glasses, but for your brain.

I don't see the harm in treating Adderall as an antidepressant at all. Why should you stop taking something that isn't nearly as dangerous as coke or meth that helps you so much? Whenever I try to discipline myself or beat myself up for taking Adderall as much as I do, it never works because I don't see the point. That's why I still take it frequently to this day.

This of course is r/StopSpeeding however; I did not forget that. So if anybody has any counterarguments to this point, by all means share. I'd honestly love to hear them because I truly cannot come up with a decent excuse on my own to stop taking Adderall when it's as safe as it is and does so much for me; I honestly think it is absolutely beautiful, and I am grateful to have something that aids me in the ways it does.",1

2020-09-22 17:51:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/ixx67g/caffeine/,Caffeine,"Believe it or not (because I sure didn't), caffeine is an amazing coping mechanism and healthy(er) substitution for hard stimulants.  I've been sober off meth for 4 months now and have been drinking bang energy drinks routinely, and have never felt better.  They give me the energy to work all day, then to come home and feel little to no crash (bang is not sugar based).  To each their own, but I've found caffeine in general to be extremely helpful in terms of energy and even helping me be more social and extroverted.  While I was using, if you told me caffeine would help tend to some of the aspects about meth and amphet that I loved the most, I'd have called you crazy. 

Also, note that too much caffeine isn't really good for your health.  Anything, over time, will eventually take it's toll, as well as tolerance build-ups (which for me happens fairly quickly with caffeine).  For me, I'm going to try and make caffeine a short term thing, and I suggest you do the same, as using it heavily long term could have you run into some health problems down the road. But for people who are just starting out in sobriety, I believe energy drinks or coffee are great substitutions. Caffeine is definitely the lesser of the 2 evils when it comes to comparing it with hard stimulants like coke and meth. Do any of you have similar experiences with caffeine post stimulant use?


P.S. I understand for some people, dependance on caffeine is highly possible.  Caffeine isn't for everyone, but I just felt the need to share my experience with it in recovery, and see if any like minded people share the same thought process in terms of coping strategies.",13

2020-09-22 14:50:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/ixtnf7/try_to_love_yourself/,Try to love yourself,"One of the reasons stimulants are so addictive for me is because of the self love they give. When I got sober I quickly realized I hate myself. I hate what I've done to my body, how I treated my family, my friends I lost, etc. I ended up in a spiraling depression for over 12 months. I'm currently 14 months clean and I'm only just now beginning to love myself. Self love is more than a good diet and exercise.

Self love is when you can sit in a room alone and not be hit with self-loathing memories, pain, regret, and shame.

Just tell yourself whether in meditation or in secret, ""I love myself"". Because there's no point in living with yourself if you hate who you've become, all that'll do is lead to escapism. Take inventory of your mistakes, and love yourself for acknowledging your wrongs in your life. And try not to be a dick to the people around you so you can come home after a long day and finally be at peace(without drugs).

words speak louder than thoughts. ",71

I used Addy, Vy and whatever like a normal frat boy for my first two years of Uni. I then had trauma that was unbearable but needed to perform, ergo daily use.

After drug problems and ups and downs. I had to finish an elite MBA while detoxing by accident from daily med use. I was a risk of wasting two year’s and 150k of my dads money, and being outed, dumped etc.

I did meth. I did the research though it was dex with a methyl group which increases absorption through fat. I knew it would be more taxing on serotonin. I grabbed and ate. I was

It. Always snorted.
Always less then 200 mg per day. It was to be productive right? Well Vyvanse stopped
Working.

Exams ended and I got a dream job. So what did I do? Bought some Vyvanse.

Per day taper. I had no withdrawal and was ready to quit. 

Week knee: 80, 80, 60,60, 20 from easy Friday to Sunday.

Week two: 60, 50, 50, 50, 40, Friday and weekend at 30

Week three: 40, 40, 40, 40, 30 , Friday 20, Saturday 20, Sunday clean 

Week 4: 20 per day, now meth free (although my experience was short an no smoking, and not to party) but still one month clean from that.

Week 5: Modafinal 300x5 weekend off

Week 6: modification 3 times

Currently: 3 months no meth. Mod 3
Times a week because readjusting the brain is long and work is highly skilled.

Point is. You can stop getting ugh and still be in a very very insane job. This is just my story and for people who feel like it’s quit the career or nothing.

So I can't seem to stay clean. I start doing really well and then always go back when feeling overwhelmed...""just 1 more weekend so I can get my shit together."" Ha- yeah right. I take pills from my husband (it is his scripts) so yeah, I am a POS. I made him order a lockbox yesterday. I wish I could cut off my supply entirely..get them completely out of my environment. 

Anyway, tomorrow will be Day 1 for me. Again.

My husband hates me right now. He is so sick of this fucked up merry-go-round and so am I. He is getting really depressed- it doesn't help that he doesn't even have an office to go into right now for social interaction (working from home due to covid). I feel terrible for continuously putting him in this position--me being too ""busy"" to do ""normal shit"" (aka high and trying desperately to get my life together OR sleeping for days). He has to pick up the slack and it is not fair (we have a toddler).

At the same time, I wish he would just make some plans of his own-- like at least to go visit his parents for a weekend or start working out again himself. I feel like he thinks that once I'm ""all better,"" then everything will be great and HE will be happy again. I don't know..maybe he is right. But I feel like I have to carry the weight of his happiness on my back too and it is really stressful. I was always the leader and planner in our relationship. I haven't been that for him for a while for obvious reasons.

I wish I could just go away for a month and come back ""better."" It is embarrassing that he has to see me like this again. He hates me right now. I hate me right now. I don't know what to tell him other than I'm trying and to please not give up on me.",12

Anyway Ive had all the usual things, vivid ass crazy dreams, lots of sleeping lots of eating and massive weight gain, Ive probably put on 40lbs.. all in all once i actually got the courage to stop its not been all that difficult, Id even go so far as to say the cravings have been minimal to almost non existent. That is to say that unlike some other drugs where my mind would be entirely consumed these have been no worse than a craving for chocolate for instance..

I know I've got a long way to go towards ""normality"" and that's the problem.. I just cant seem to get anything done. I start and then stop. My brain doesnt wanna do jack shit.. its been getting better but still ive accomplished practicslly nothing these past few weeks.. and even though its not what id really call a craving, theres a little birdie in my brain that says ""hey man with a little meth wed get thesr things done"" and you know, its true. it really is true. thats not to say i didnt have times where i spent hours on end gakked out of my mind and got absolutely nothing done.. but I really was accomplishing and learning so many things. My output was 100 but now its down to a 1.

I dont know if anyone can relate but its less of an ""OMG I NEED METH OR IM GONNA DIE"" type thing and more of an ""I just wanna feel normal for a few hours and get some things done""

Its just that she devil tina trying to sink her claws back into me and I honestly have no trouble resisting.. but as time keeps going on Im just starting to find this to be a real fucking drag.. Im guessing this is basicslly what sets off the depression for most people too...

I even went and bought myself a new keyboard thinking itd make me more inclined to want to do some work but all I did was throw dampeners on the keycaps and write a few words and laugh at how ridiculously loud the cherry mx blues are... annd ive just been laying in bed watching ancient aliens reruns and hacking darts every once n a while.

2020-09-17 15:20:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/iuqd4y/how_i_flushed_my_vyvanse/,How I flushed my Vyvanse!,"This was originally a comment on my own post (the image with the liquid Vyvanse) but I thought it would be better suited as a stand alone post:

Hi everybody and thank you so so much for all the support in the comments! I’m currently on day #2 no speed, although technically it’s day #1 since I decided (being the addict I am) to do my very last binge right before flushing. That was a 350 mg binge at the beginning of which I started writing the promised post I said in the title was “upcoming” but of course I just wrote like 1200 words as if starting a book and then got “speed trapped” (focus stuck) doing something else entirely and then something else, never finishing the post.

That’s one of the things I had a strong love/hate relationship with with speed. Yes, the super focus is amazing. Yes, I loved it. Yes, I will miss it. But what I will NOT MISS is the lack of control that comes with it. Essentially, I would be high and focused as fuck during my use, both the moderately high use as well as the extreme abuse, and I would not have the slightest say in what “we” (speed and I) were going to accomplish together or enjoy together during any given period of use or abuse unless the dose was in the 50-100 mg range - then maybe. It was all up to the speed.

To clarify, my Vyvanse was indeed in capsule form. I flushed my last 26 capsules. What I did was, I poured water into the bottle and let them dissolve. Somebody rightly pointed out in the comments that flushing meds was a bad idea and thank you for that! I really wish I would have found another way to rid myself of the devil’s elixir. Anyhow, I knew the capsules would dissolve because I noticed during my use and abuse that even when leaving them on the tongue long enough, the thin plastic that makes up the capsules would start melting. Then I shook the bottle like a madman. Interestingly, it’s totally watertight. Finally, I let hot water from the tap pour on it for a couple of minutes. Then shook some more. This disgusting blue goo, the devil’s elixir, is what I ended up with. And down the toilette it went.

I will say I was tempted to take just another tiny sip from that 26-capsule-solution (1820 mg of Vyvanse in total) but thankfully the responsible voice in my head that desires a healthy drug-free life prevented that from happening and so my last binge didn’t exeed 350 mg.

Today, I am feeling very fatigued and kind of sick, not accomplishing much besides laying in bed watching YouTube, eating and going to the bathroom. It will be a real challenge taking the first speed-free shower and I don’t even want to think about that right now. Simple tasks like walking up (or down!) the stairs are very strenuous. But I will keep going strong without speed and take steps toward a life without fake happiness. Next step (an even harder one) will be talking to my doctor because if I don’t my “amazing” free supply will once more be at my disposal which it MUST not be).

Thank you all for the support, love and peace and be at ease ❤️✌🏻",4

I got the genetic test cheek swab at the doctor and it's telling me why certain drugs never helped me and I'm learning about this Gene I have making me ultra-rapid metabolizer of certain drugs. My test report covers ssris and opioids and lots of other drugs and explains that certain drugs that I metabolize rapidly will never help me and will just make me dependent or suffer from toxic side effects. This explains why antidepressants never helped and why I almost got hooked on opioids and why my dad did too. Now since I did suffer from a stimulant addiction and stimulants not on my report I did a little research about the Gene and there is something indicating Meth becomes quickly extra neurotoxic for people like me. This explains why I was able to fry my brain in only 2 years. Great. Thanks I wish I had gotten these tests before I picked it up.

I’m almost 10 months clean from heavy adderall use for about 6 years. I quit for my ex-bf who unfortunately doesn’t want to try to make it work anymore. There have been so many times that I’ve been so grateful that he got me to see the light, and feeling like my life is so much better without drugs, but honestly, since it finally seems like we are done for good I’m not sure I want to stay sober anymore. 

Truth is, I hate who I am now. I feel completely empty. For so long I’ve trying to follow a strict diet and exercise routine, and that did help, but it wasn’t like I magically felt better. It was more like I was fighting a losing battle with depression, but at least I was fighting. 

It’s all a very long story. I can’t even begin to explain it in a single post. Even with exercising and cutting out carbs 95% of the time, I’ve gained like 25 lbs. I’m embarrassed to walk around. The past few days I’ve done nothing but eat thousands of calories of junk every day, and it’s all I want to do. I don’t want to keep living this way. I don’t have any goals. My ex is pushing me to have goals that don’t involve him when he used to love how attached to him I was. I honestly have done so many things to improve myself because of him, and I was grateful for that. I don’t even know how to begin with finding what I want when just existing in this skin makes me cringe. There’s a big part of me who feels like I should just take adderall so I can stop obsessively binging on food, so I can feel interesting again and want something, but what if it didn’t even help anymore?

By 7 am I was feeling really up to just skipping the sleep what so ever because the sunrise was so beautiful outside. So I popped 140 mg at once - opening the capsules inside my mouth and savoring the sweet tasting powder and then swallowing the empty capsules also. Note, that usually when I do 140 mg a day it is with a 2-5 hour interval.

Funny thing is, my tolerance is so high and apparantly I was so tired that the first thing I did was taking a nap and SLEEPING like a baby for exactly two hours. The first two hours after popping are supposed to be the most fun ones. At least this is what I find. But I just slept. My allnighter plans out of the window.

Just wanted to share this with you guys. Tolerance to amphetamines builds up so quickly. I first Vyvanse 10 months ago. One 50 mg capsule would get my HIGH AS A KITE for 12 hours. So amazing. Some weeks later a 70 mg capsule would do the trick. I always had off days. Maybe only two 70 mg days per week to reset tolerance. I lived like that for some months. Then, the drug just got the better of me.

I am prescribed 120 mg a day by my doctor by the way. Some people go as high as 200 mg per day - prescribed. But this is dangerous. As soon as I started taking the Vyvanse every day, I was hooked. Now, there is no stimulant free day whatsoever. A 70 mg capsule every morning is just mandatory I want to wake up and fell not like shit. Recalling how hight that same dose used to get me in the past is absurd.

Now, I have to take 210 mg in a day if I really wanna get high again and fell like superman (fake superman). Unfortunately, I've also gotten addicted to benzos do to the anxiety the stims give me. But those are self-administered (my father is a doctor) and the phychiatrist who prescribes me the Vyvanse does not know about my benzo use/abuse. The benzos are very handy for sure to aid with sleeping on a speed binge. Yesterday, I took a 3.5 mg of Clonazepam spread throughout the day along with the 210 mg of the Vyvanse.

A few weeks ago I did a 350 mg Vyvanse binge on one day and then had to take 8 mg of Clonazepam to to get four hours of sleep, only to take 210 mg of Vyvanse at once immediately upon waking because I had a really important thing to attent to that day. Not all days are binges like that. My record is as stated 560 mg of Vyvanse in a 22 hour period along with regular benzo intake to regulate anxiety. This binged caused my to miss my flight because I got so obbsessed cleaning my appartment. I really wish I could stop taking those drugs... and just be satisfied with life without stimulants!

I don't drink alcohol ever. I don't like cocaine (very fortunate for health and finances). Opioids aren't my thing either although the only one I've tried is Tramadol and that one is supposed to feel more like speed than anything else. I don't smoke cigarettes ever. Never had a problem with nicotine. I'm not your typical drug user type of guy. But still I am very addicted to speed. Also, I get 120 mg of Vyvanse per day legally every month - and I pay 0$ for it! It's like free speed to your heart's content. Makes things more difficult.

Do you have any tips on trying to come off or lower the dose? Or should I just take my prescribed dose daily (with the occational binge) and face the fact that I will be addicted to amphetamine (and benzos) for the rest of my life? What do you recommend I do?

Many thanks and blessings to you who have read this far.

TLDR; I'm addicted to pharmaceutical speed and I am afraid things will wind up badly if I continue on this path.",7
2020-09-13 19:55:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/is9q9q/abusing_adderall_for_weight_loss/,abusing adderall for weight loss,I've posted on here before and really appreciated all the support and feedback I got. I was just curious if there are any people on this forum that primarily used adderall as a weight loss drug. I was prescribed it for ADHD obviously but found it made exercise and eating healthy so easy and fun. After I stopped working out as much and began eating more regularly (unhealthier but balanced) I did not gain any weight. As soon as I came off of it I gained back all the weight quickly and have lost so much self confidence to the point where I can't look at myself in the mirror anymore and seeing old photos of when I was skinnier makes me want to cry. I just feel so ugly now and unattractive and I feel like I will never be comfortable or happy in my own skin again knowing I once looked so good. Like for example a guy I didn't know saw a photo of me from about a year ago and was like wow that doesn't even look like you. It just sucks hearing stuff like that because it makes me feel so bad about myself,9
2020-09-13 13:49:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/is2w00/rebirthing_pains/,Rebirthing Pains,"Fair warning: this is a PAWS-fueled rant.

From the Netflix food-porn series *Chef’s Table* I learned a few years ago of a Japanese cuisine called *kaiseki*: an ordered multi-course meal with certain fixed elements and certain opportunities for variation. As one chef from the series puts it: “Everything has to be connected to one another and there has to be a flow.” “It’s really very melodic,” says another. It is the best metaphor I’ve tripped over for thinking about what it’s like to hit rock bottom. It’s not a single event, but a whole sequence of themed servings of disaster, which follow predictable enough patterns, but to which we all bring our own raw ingredients.

A lot of us, I’m sure, didn’t develop drug problems because we were happy, hopeful, well-supported, trauma-free individuals. I remember learning from school prevention programs and from pop-psych hearsay about all the personality traits and life events that can predispose you to drug abuse, and though I checked a lot of those boxes, I never really thought they applied to me. Even as my alcohol use and my experimentation with other drugs ticked up, I still thought of them as more or less unrelated to everything I had been told all my life made me vulnerable to substance abuse.

Four months into sobriety, I’m dealing with what feels like too much: all those things that might have steered me toward drugs are unresolved; I added to them a whole bunch of new problems with my substance abuse; I seem to have really aggressive PAWS, which I think is interacting in nasty ways with a post-viral syndrome I’ve had for a few years; I’m going into the sixth year of a PhD program I’m less and less confident that I’ll finish; and the whole world is going to shit—my state’s on fire, the pandemic is raging, and historically speaking it looks like we’re in 1938.

This whole complex of problems is giving me a temptation I’m sure I’m not the first addict to entertain: I just want to be born again, to rebuild from nothing, to declare Day One. I may actually be in a fair position to do so.

My family has always been crazy and I was already losing friends before I moved 2,500 miles away for graduate school. I talk less and less with what friends I had back home, I stopped hearing from my mother a few months ago and my father about two years ago, and I haven’t made many solid friendships where I am now.

My career path doesn’t look so great at the moment either. Life has thrown pile after pile of shit at me since I started this program. I busted my ass—or at least had frequent enough fits of intense motivation—from the time I was eighteen until I was twenty-five to get here, but I’m finding it hard to find confidence in or excitement for my dissertation. This new recession looks like it’ll further hollow out the job market that never fully recovered from the Great Recession. And because of what the virus did to me and what I may have done to myself with my substance abuse, I’m not sure I’ll ever again have the mental energy to do my work.

It sounds ridiculous, even childish, but part of me really just wants to save money for the next few months, rush through the dissertation without any intention of staying in academia, move to a new state, delete all my social media, change my name and number, and find a new community where I can uproot everything I think might have made me like this in the first place.

I said above that I never thought any of the warning signs of substance abuse applied to me. Ugly family history? Their problem, not mine. Childhood sexual abuse? I’m over it. Difficulty fitting in? I don’t need anyone anyway. One of my problems, perhaps my major problem, is, I think, that *I’ve never thought any rules applied to me*. And for about the first quarter century of my life, they really seemed not to. I could shoplift without getting caught. I didn’t have to push myself in anything because I was smart. I kept strange hours because in the dead of night I did my best work. I didn’t need a religion or a philosophy or even advice because I had all the answers. I could be an asshole because even if I didn’t fit in I could still draw people to me. I didn’t have to work through any problems because I thought I could shrug them all off.

I think that version of myself is finally dead now. I—if there’s even a thing left here to call “I”—want to try life again the other way: sleep at night and wake in the morning, take care of my body, act like an adult, do what I’m told, lay a foundation, find a god or a purpose, work through my problems, cage my pride and throw away the key—you get the idea.

But for the present I’m in hell, or purgatory, hell-lite. My brain itself feels like it hurts. I’ve never had such uncontrollable, horrific thoughts. I have to swat away suicidal ideation like it’s a bat that got in my house. I can be patient (from Latin, *patior*, “to suffer”) as long as I feel like the after-dinner mint of this shit meal is a second chance at life, a rebirth, but most days I am scared I had one chance at life that some combination of pain and sloth and stubbornness made me fuck up beyond repair.",22

It seems like the beginning,
7 months in.
Don’t know what I’m feeling
Slightly shaking, feeling thin.

You pulled me in, slow at first.
Didn’t know you were the worst for me.
Lying, lost and feeling fine.
But the low is a bottomless cave.
I’m brave, but can I be enough
To not reach back into your velvet rage?

You sit in shreds, my own doing.
But the deed had to be done.
It’s only day one, and I think about you—
And all the fun things we could do.

But what is fun?

You’re idea of fun makes my heart race.
I hate myself, my fingers shake
Spends hours on end doing nothing at all.
But feeling great, completely awake.

Everything has changed since you came my way.
I won’t let you steal another day.
I’m not myself when I’m with you.
You’ll tempt me back—
Oh, I know you.

But this time I’m fighting,
and I mean what I’m writing.
Goodbye to hating myself.
Not who I am when I’m with you.

You ruined my capability for love.
Love for the one who deserved my affection.
Spent time with you, and less with him.
You ended us.

I hope I’m strong enough.
These next few months you’ll make it rough.
Goodbye.

I’ll be thinking of you.",18

I was going to add a please don’t judge or hate disclaimer, but you know what. I hate the sound of what I’m about to write just as much as anyone, and screw it...if you need to judge me or hate me go ahead, maybe it’ll help to hear it. 

I’ve tried to quit and have quit methamphetamine a few times, some longer than others. 

For me, my biggest obstacle (in my head and also in reality, I think) is just getting past the first week of painful tiredness. Painful! I’ve always needed more sleep as a child, and I just cannot move for the first 3-4 days. I don’t think temptation is as romantic a notion for me anymore, it’s just the dang lack of energy that keeps me using. 

My problem is that I have a 2 year old child. I guess we can get through it together, but I think she’s at the age that she can get herself into some actual trouble if I wasn’t able to stay awake. 

If I had a friend stay with me for a few days, I would do this now. Well, I think I’m going for it whether I’ve got that or not. I’ve talked with someone who is a sober mother about staying with us for that week to help with my daughter, but she’s since found employment and I’m not sure if she is as available. Another wonderful sober mom friend lives nearby and wants to help, but she works full time, and has two awesome teenagers. It’s still a blessing to hear from her this morning that she wants to help. I’m grateful. 

Guys I’m in tears right now which honestly surprised me. Since covid, we have seen zero family besides her father. Zero. Then my mom got hit by a car as a fucking pedestrian the day before she was supposed to come out here to visit us. (We are a state away from where I grew up.) Then my cat died and we found her body. So I thought I was kind of numb to everything now. 

I just want out. I want out so bad. My dreams are always warning me about my health now. Like it’s a turning point for my body. My abdomen is swollen and I’ve gotten basic bloodwork done, and they say it’s okay, but I know something is wrong. I drip in sweat if I move a muscle, and I feel biley shit slosh up my throat every morning, and it looks and feels like there is an 8-pound alien in my belly. 

Anyway to my original point - are there any sober moms on here who would consider taking a free vacation for themselves for 4-5 days to help me get through this? I run an [[popular short term vacation rental website]] on my property, and live in a beautiful tourist destination in the Southwest USA. I don’t know if it’s breaking rules. But we are the “Red Rocks”. 
I have a spare bedroom up here with us. I’m scared.

I finally had a little bit of sobriety under my belt during the quarantine—about 5 months—and the day before I go back to school I decide to hit up my dealer.

Made the usual promises to myself to only take 1, then 2...then 3,4,5 a day. XR, IR, vyvanse, whatever my dealer had I was buying it. Right when I finally was getting in a decent place with my finances too.

The ridiculous part is I know that it doesn’t even help me with school anymore. Or work or socializing or whatever. I either don’t feel it at all or take too much and have a panic attack; either way I act despondent and detached and weird and can’t stop ruminating about all the negative impacts to my life Adderall and all that shit has caused me. Or like, that I’ve brought on myself, you know what I mean. 

I feel like I can’t stop though because it’s my senior year of college—really my 5th year, since I’m retaking half my classes from last year because I could not manage them due to my extreme substance abuse (I drank heavily when off of stimulants). Went to rehab briefly in December, they told me not to go back but I did after 45 days and boy I regret it now. I was cracked out of my mind January through the beginning of March, which is when my dealer moved back home and I was forced to get clean. I literally did nothing but lay in bed for two months, and while things got marginally better, I don’t want to be completely useless again either. I could not read, write, or process anything it felt like. 

I feel beyond awful lying to my boyfriend and basically everyone I know, including my therapist, about my Adderall usage. 

My boyfriend hasn’t noticed yet, or at least not to the point he’s said anything, but he’s not stupid and has made a few remarks about me eating less and being up late. I’m sure I’ll slip up at some point by leaving a pill out since my brain is so fried. I hate not being present with him and laying in bed for hours while he sleeps, debating on whether to fake sleep or get up or not. I scroll through this thread most of the

I want it still, I want to run
But i know if I go back
Nothing good will come of it 
And then I'll crack
Under the addiction, lose my sense of reality
Then I'll end up the same 
Begging for even a bit of sanity. 
The sober life feels lame,
I'm bored as fuck,
And sleeping all the damn time.
But my friends and family 
Seem to think it's fine.
""They're finally off the meth""
All the while I think about
That last shooting sesh
And how good it felt
And made me rush
It also sucked
Because i knew 
""This is my last one, im fucked.""
Or i can get better, become someone new.
Coming down is the *best* part
Because you see all the effects
It has had on your body, 
Especially your heart. 
You start to feel then let go
Of all the anger and frustration 
That the meth made you show.
You start to piece together 
The nights and days you barely remember 
And things you'd never do
It'll remind you of the monster 
Shooting meth made you.
Some people aren't as lucky
They can't release the grip
That it has and it'll rip
You from everything you love
Even the little things
You never even thought of. 
From experience I will say
Meth will ruin your life 
And you'll regret it everyday. 
The needle on the other hand
That's a different story.
You'll find yourself grand
Then want to stick your thigh
Because there's a vein popping 
""Ohhh I can get that one try!""
But what for? Why?
Because that ritual of preparing 
For that rush of hours long trying 
And finally hitting that vein
Gives you the adrenaline before the
Dopamine. 
You can't hate the needle
Because it's not the drug itself
So it's harder to put down 
Then you'll find yourself
Wondering what else can I inject?
Fuck, how can I make myself forget? 
Its similar to self harm
You like the pain, and the warm
Feeling you get when you cant think of anything
But the blood running
And forming that ring
Around the drain. 
The sober life is lame
That's for sure.
But it's better than being found
Seizing, foaming from the mouth
Or suffering from a stroke,
Scared to go to the hospital 
Because it's the meth that made you choke.",4

Since the middle of June, I have been going hard. There were two periods of week breaks, the first month was near daily and the last 3 weeks I went on 2 3 day benders and this week I tweaked every day except one. I usually smoke about h half gram a day, if its very good then a bit less. 

I am now about 32 hours since my last dose. I am feeling awful. My feet hurt as they often do after any longer than 3 days, I finally slept for about 6 hours last night, and I ate a big meal this morning, about to have another one. I had some benzos, but I still feel like I'm tweaking. In fact, I feel like I have social anxiety, I don't want to leave the house, or even go downstairs to pick up food. I am afraid of my phone. Luckily tomorrow is a holiday, but I would have liked to see my family. I dont think I should like this, plus I have wounds all over my hands from picking.

One of my girlfriends would like to come tomorrow, but I'm afraid I will be mean to her. Thats another thing thats started recently, I get very irritable with friends and family. I have a hard time feeling genuine love for them, although I always have and its always been very important to me. I feel a lot of love for people I tweak with, although I usually tweak alone, but not for people in my real life. When I tweak, I am not productive. I generally talk to girls on dating apps, watch porn and masturbate. I used to have a girl that did it with me, and the sex was out of control, but I have a hard time finding girls who are ok with meth (at least not the types who like me, who are usually the college educated and successful types)

I have messed up some minor things in my real life but nothing that isn't salvageable. But I look at my hands, and I look at my already receding gums (unless im imagining it, and my teeth are becoming more jagged as well) and I feel the inability to think after  a week with 10 hours of sleep and really only 3 full meals...,,.I just cant continue anymore. Meth is better than I imagined, its going to a total paradise land for a few days, but I need to remember my real life. 

How much damage could I have done in 3 months? And how hard do you think it will be for me? The other couple times in my life I used I went on week long binges, and I would think about it for a few months and then I wouldn't at all anymore. Could this happen this time?",6

Trough this whole period the side effects I've experienced I've been bleeding gum, 'meth teeth', constipation, the occasional sleepless night along with high hearth rate. 

The side effects got slowly getting worse and worse when I got a new supply over two months and this pills seem to be more potent than my previous ones. 

On Wednesday I took them in the morning, started studying and everything was going well, until afternoon when my hearthrate jumped through the roof and started feeling tickling sensations on the right side of top of my head. I took some phenibut to calm myself, felt fine for a few hours and then started vomiting...

Since then I've been:
* having strange sensations in top of my head, sometimes ticklish, sometimes like my brain is cold.
* minor pain in various places in my abdomen, 
* minor chest pain and increased health rate 
* strange taste in my mouth, metallic taste in my mouth(could be due to bleeding but I never had it before.

A couple of people encouraged me to speak to a Doc about antidepressant medication, buproprion was recommended.


I have tried this previously, in my pre-vyvanse abuse days, as an ADHD drug. It didn't sit well with me at all, gave me awful adrenal anxiety.


It's also a very hard drug to get hold of here in the UK, can only be accessed privately, not through our National Health Service. 


I can't afford to see a private Doc right now, but spoke to one through the NHS.


She prescribed me amitriptyline. A ""TCA"" antidepressant, which apparently works on serotonin/norepinephrine, and negligiblely on dopamine.


I'm reluctant to try an SSRI as my research on them suggests they may reduce dopmaine transmission?


That can't be good for my already dopmaine deprived brain, surely?

Long Post… please persevere…. 


I was addicted to amphetamine (base) for a couple of years around 2014-2016. I loved the way it made me feel and the only reason I came off it was that my daughter found it and threatened to stop me seeing my grand daughter. 

I had my own business , ran a home and had a wonderful marriage. I functioned well, although I was aware at the time that my tolerance was quite high. 


After I stopped using it in 2016 I became menopausal and developed a severely underactive thyroid. Both of these conditions caused similar symptoms, eg. weight gain, severe depression and together with the psychological and physical withdrawals from amphetamines I truly felt that my life was over, even after the withdrawal period had passed. I do accept that some of the symptoms would have been due to withdrawal, but they wouldn't have lasted four yeara, nor would they have got worse rather than better. 


I gained 4 stone (56lbs), lost my looks, my personality, my drive, ambition and energy. I underwent 2 stays in a crisis house due to severe depression, nearly lost my marriage and business and if it wasn't for my granddaughter almost certainly would have ended my life. 


This was due to the thyroid and the menopause combined. Endless trips to my GP and prescription thyroid meds, HRT and powerful antidepressants have not helped. Every single day is a struggle.  I cant remember the last time I laughed, cried or felt any emotion other than self pity. 


Fours years on, I struggle to get out of bed, need to sleep in the afternoon and even though I've joined a gym, eat healthily and have given up caffeine and alcohol, I still feel dead and hollow inside. 


So…. with an imminent house move and the dread of not even being able to stay awake some days to even think about packing, I today procured some amphetamine base. 


The tiniest amount this morning brought the sunshine out after 4 years of negativity, greyness and . Without being off my actual tits I have cleaned, done some paperwork, prepared a meal and had more physical and mental energy than I have for a long long time. 



My question is why shouldn't I take a sensible amount daily? Why shouldn't I take this drug in the morning when I take my Levothyroxine, HRT and multivitamins? 


I'm not asking for a lecture on the morality of this…. I'm well aware that drugs are illegal and I shouldn't have crossed that line… But it is what it is and today I feel better than I've felt in a long time. The prospect of spending the rest of my life as the last few years have been is unthinkable….and I won't do it.

When I'm that low I can unequivocally believe I have no other choice than to quit. But the sun finally broke through today and the acute symptoms are fading, so I'm starting to feel better. Now comes the kicker - when I start to feel better the cravings really hit hard. Some part of my brain says ""you are feeling good, so let's party!"" And with that comes the anxious antsy feeling that I have to act; that there is something I should be doing or something I forgot to do. That's the craving that has beat me before, not the depression ones or tired ones where I'm just trying to get back to even. I see you tricky craving. And I name you. Now the task becomes moving through the anxiety or learning how to disapate it so it doesn't keep building until I give in. I will render that pathway completely powerless then be on to the next.

I'm in a tight spot and I'm starting to get desperate, so I wanted to make a post here and check in with this community for motivation and to keep myself accountable. I've got a long rant to post to get some stuff off my chest, but there's a **tl;dr at the bottom**.

I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was very young and my parents were worried about me in school etc. so I went on ritalin by second grade. By middle and high school I recall not enjoying the feeling of being on these pills so I stopped around age 16. I never abused and was vaguely aware that kids were doing that, but I just didn't get it. Fast forward to university a few years, I was struggling with my ADHD and called up my shrink who was happy to re-up my rx if that's what I wanted. So I got a fresh rx, which I then used rather productively for a year or so before devolving into typical US college student abuse. Crushing up a line or two for parties and so on. It did help me get work done, but during this time I was also laying the seeds of my own destruction it seems. Anyway, my rx ran out eventually and being so far away I couldn't get a hold of my shrink so I went med-less for another good long time.

I later moved to a mid-size city where, eventually through random roommates, I acquired drug connections for more pills and other drugs like E. During this time I was extremely stressed out doing a Master's degree and a horrifying new behavior began to crop up. I was watching porn for hours on end in some perverse attempt to avoid responsibility/reality. I can't really recall if I was using ADD meds at this time to boost my wank sessions, but I remember them sometimes  lasting a few hours and missing coursework because of it. This really wreaked havoc in my sex life as I became unable to have real sex due to performance anxiety or maybe porn-induced erectile dysfunction. I even remember a few girls really throwing themselves at me (they were nice young women too, I'm an idiot). But, eventually I got lucky and got into a friends/FWB situation and was seemingly cured of the sex problems. Around this time I also started doing ketamine, which I love and find super interesting. However, this too was a largely motivated by escape-ism. Eventually I decided to move abroad to do my PhD to experience something new.

This is where I'm really getting fucked and I've been stuck in a terrible loop for about a year and a half. From the start my training experience has been pretty shitty. It's not uncommon in PhD-land but I have very little guidance and obviously this is super stressful. I should have seen immediately this was driving my drug behavior since moving, but I guess I didn't or didn't want to. It's a pretty big problem because where I live now, casual drug use is extremely normalized and drugs are cheap, strong, and plentiful. I was able to continue my moderate K usage (2g/month), again under the guise of psychonautics but more likely I was just running away. Eventually, I started dating my current gf that I'm completely in love with and I know she loves me more than anything. This pulled me out a bit of a K-induced tail-spin. Things were going good drug-wise, but at some point I thought ""fuck work is so hard, I can never focus. I should just take a bit of speed"". So I did. It worked out ok for a little while but after a few months it was more like I was just doing the speed to get high and doing anything while being tuned up. A while into this, I discovered the sickening joy of stim fapping which has done a real number on my psyche and emotional state. This brings me to about 18 months ago.

Since then, I've gone in and out of periods of moderate-heavy abuse. I think I'm somewhat decent at hiding my addictions (unfortunately). Even when I'm completely addicted to various hard drugs, I rarely do them daily for more than a couple days. So for speed and to a lesser extent K, this leads to binges of maybe 3-4 days or maybe 2x 3-days where I'll crush through a gram of speed paste while mostly stim fapping, drinking, and smoking weed, only going through the daily motions to make an appearance in the real world. These binges are usually broken up by 2-4 weeks during which I'll clean up and start functioning again a little bit.  

But, speed has been my destroyer. I'm a shell of what I used to be, physically and mentally. I've lost so much weight a lot of my clothes hang off me like they belong to someone else. My PhD, which is a trainwreck (part of which is not my fault) requires my strongest abilities and attention but FUCK! I can't give that now! It's hard just to get out of bed and feed myself and the stress just pushes me right back to picking up another g of speed when I go on my monthly weed run. Maybe once every 6 months I call out sick for a day because I'll have a binge that I didn't manage well enough, but there's been PLENTY of times where I showed up to work on no sleep and just sat at my computer like a fucking zombie pretending to play human. Even once or twice I was tweaked enough for people to say something and I came up with some completely unbelievable excuse.

 I've been keeping a journal for about a year now that was meant to keep me straight and it did for a while. Actually it became more a trip journal for a while once I thought I had speed locked down, more about my occasional mushroom or acid trip and general feelings on life. But when I look back over the last 6-9 months of entries, I've written ""DO NOT PICK UP SPEED, DON'T KEEP ANY IN THE HOUSE"". Yet here I am.... This has got to be the most classic sign of addiction of all time, right?

It's killing me because sometimes when I reflect on my life, I think I'm so lucky and I'm so close to achieving my dreams. Something that many people out there don't have the opportunity to do. I have an amazing relationship with my girlfriend. I'm highly educated and I have a strong family support system. But I just can't get there completely. I feel like I'm spinning my wheels in the mud. I think a big part of that was triggered by my shitty training experience, which has been unfulfilling. This led to me thinking about my ADHD and it crippling me in the past, and trying to compensate for that with drugs. At this point, I can't untangle this relationship. Am I fucked because I can't save my PhD studies because I'm fucking ADHD and not capable? Am I fucked because of my drug problem which has destroyed my ability to function highly? Would I be fucked even if I was able to give it my all? This is the shit that keeps me up at night and has me looking for an escape into a sleepless night of tweaking' (and beatin' my meat in, hehe/crying).

I've been reading plenty of people's posts and am glad to have found this sub. I'm sorry for the literal life story but I've never put it all down in one place. Thanks if you made it to the end. I'm planning to check in here from time to time, hopefully to celebrate those sobriety milestones and support others doing the same. 

**tl;dr:** \~18 months into speed addiction with about 1 year primarly focused on stim fapping. 2g/month at peak, more recently 1g/month amphetamine paste. Need motivation, support, and a place to stay accountable for staying of this disgusting shit. Thanks and good luck.",6

I'm really, really struggling with the depression. A sort of soul-crushing, near-total anhedonia. 

This depression in turn is giving me severe anxiety, thinking I've ruined my brain and my life.

In the past week or so, there have been occasions where the depression seems less severe, like little ""windows"" of mild relief.

My appetite is gone, sex drive too. I find it hard to sleep because of the anxiety but when I do sleep I sleep well.

I'm taking promethazine. Seems to help a little sleep/anxiety-wise, but I worry it may be compounding the depression because it's a moderate D2 antagonist?

I have zopiclone/ativans which I've resorted to a few times but I really don't want to go down that route having been through benzo withdrawal in past.

I'm eating very healthy, I'm running every day.

I've no job and very few friends left, so very isolated.

State of despair tbh. Hard to put it into word

Not really sure what purpose of this post is. I guess introduce myself. I found this sub a few days ago and along with my little ""windows"" of relief, it's given me hope.

2020-09-03 08:36:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/ilsjz5/having_trouble_quiting_stimulants_for_good/,Having trouble quiting stimulants for good,"Sorry for the long post. TL;DR at bottom. 

I used to be a semi-daily meth user a little over a year ago. That drug gripped me like no other. I tried to quit but relapsed. Tried to quit again and relapsed once more. This continued again and again but with longer periods of being clean between relapses. Progress was being made. This kept on and I'm now 4-5 months clean from meth.

However, recently I've ""relapsed"" on more than one occasion, not meth but other stimulants, with the intent of creating a meth-like high. 

The first relapse was with seligiline and PEA. I'm fascinated by drugs and pharmacology so i wanted to give it a try and thought I could control myself. Well the inner fiend in me snorted that caustic shit until I lost track of time and was even smoking it from a homemade foil pipe. Wasted days, numerous neurotransmitters, my lungs felt toxic for days and I had nose bleeds for a week. 

Second relapse. I bought speed intended to replace my Vyvanse script until the next Rx was made. - I didn't take more Vyvanse than prescribed -just couldn't get an appointment made before my supply ran out. I got the speed and the next day once it was dried, I snorted it all. Pure impuslivity.

Third relapse. I acquired some mephedrone which I was supposed to save for my birthday. The day I got it, I asked my gf to hide it because I don't have self control with that substance. She didn't hide it... Later in the evening I'm crushing and snorting line after line ignoring my olfactory pain receptors desperate for me to stop before my septum perforates. My gf walks in midway during this, demands I hand over the baggie and flushes it. As you may know with mephedrone, the redose compulsion is high. I start looking for anything I can take to get high, even contemplating carpet surfing. I settled for NEP which imo belongs in the garbage, at least the batch I had that. Alongside NEP, I took a very large amount of Vyvanse.

Abusing the medication I need to function crossed a line for me. I decided if I abused it once it's probable I will abuse it again. I handed over the bottle to my gf who is now in charge of dispensing it. I'm also no longer buying stims as I've proven repeatedly that I lack sufficient self-control. 

My main concern though, is the devil on my shoulder who's with me some days. Telling me something like """"you've earned it, you deserve a break and some fun, there's nothing wrong with taking stimulants recreationally sometimes. Do it!"" He can be very convincing, especially on my bad days. Even with my new measures in place, I'm worried I'll give in to the idea that being sober from stims is overrated. Maybe I need more constant reminders of the damage done when I binge...

I have an appointment with an addiction counsellor, but the wait time is long here. In the meantime, can I please get advice/tips on staying clean for good? I should also add that I eat a generally healthy diet, exercise often and tick off most of those basic related recommendations. Thanks.

TL;DR: ex meth addict. Sober for 4-5 months. Keep chasing the meth high with more benign stimulants but this is still causing significant strains in my life. I would like to get some advice on how to stay sober for good.",4

All I want is to do amphetamine again,"I was never a heavy user of amphetamine. Unless you count my binges where I went all in, 5-6 days of barely any sleep and multiple grams of speed. But then I could go weeks, sometimes a month or two, without taking any. Before that, I was prescribed Vyvanse 50mg for about a year (diagnosed with ADHD) from mid 2018 to mid 2019. 

3 months ago I decided I wanted to quit for good after suffering from my first drug induced psychosis. I ended up staying awake for around 100+ hours and well, I was playing with fire to say the least.

I was hoping that I'd feel better sooner. In a way, I guess I did. I reconnected with friends, I've found a new girl I've had a thing with for the past 1-2 months, started working out again and so on. But when I'm home alone? All I do is binge Netflix and YouTube. I can't be bothered to go to the store to buy food so I order takeaway instead. Can't be bothered to play games or do any of my hobbies.

Funny thing is, as soon as I'm with other people, all of that fades away. I'll cook food, I'll be a social butterfly, and life just seems alright. So that's what I've been doing the past 3 months, staying busy socially as much as I can. Though it's inevitable that I'm going to have a day for myself at home again. And today is another one of those days.

What frustrates me so much is that I feel no drive to do ANYTHING. I just want to be a lazy slob who orders pizza and numbs my mind with entertainment I couldn't care less about. I feel so numb and I know that amphetamine will make my gears start grinding again. I know it'll make me interested in games, my hobbies, cleaning my apartment and so on. I know amphetamine will make me stop numbing my mind and instead actually do something with my day. 

How do I forget this? Before amphetamine, I could be totally engrossed in whatever game. I could sit down and work towards something I truly enjoyed. In 2016 I used speed sporadically, but it still didn't affect the things I enjoyed. After a year of amphetamine prescriptions? I feel like I'm not able to go back there. My mind is convinced it needs amphetamine to enjoy anything. It's convinced I need it to be productive. Without it, I'm in a constant fog of numbness. 

3 months is the longest I've gone without in 2 years. I was hoping this fog would lift, but it hasn't. And now I've ordered a gram of speed. I feel like my experience with speed has permanently tainted my mind. As if I'll always associate everything in everyday life with speed. How speed makes everything easier.",61

Today marks Day 2 of no adderall (and no cigarettes - I don't even want them if I'm off adderall). I feel like I'm living in a fog. I can't string thoughts together. I'm not getting anything done. I feel totally worthless. 

Every time I try to stop, I reach this point where literally all I can do is stare at the wall. I know that taking 5-10mg of adderall would give me my energy back. But then I start the cycle all over again.

2020-09-01 09:17:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/ikk2va/a_few_tips_for_paws_relief/,A Few Tips for PAWS Relief,"Greetings, everyone! I'm a little over a hundred days clean from a nasty Vyvanse/marijuana binge that landed me in the hospital, and I have to say it's been a bit of a rougher trip than I expected. I'm really hoping the lingering cognitive issues I'm having aren't permanent.

In any event, PAWS has definitely been a big part of my struggle. I don't feel like myself, my body feels strange to me, and even on a ""good"" day what I feel is to happiness what La Croix is to flavor. On the worst days, I feel like my brain is dying or like I'm going to lapse into schizophrenia.

All of which has led me to develop some strategies for dealing with PAWS that I figured I might pass on, since I know many of you are in the same boat.

1. *Watch a cartoon series*. Cartoons, I find, are the right balance of stimulating and simple that, on the one hand, they get me out of my head when I'm suffering or panicking, but on the other hand, they don't overtax my brain and I don't have to concentrate too hard to follow them. I've been loving *King of the Hill*, *Venture Bros*, and *Neon Genesis Evangelion*.

2. *Microwaveable spicy ramen is a godsend*. I know we should be focusing on being as healthy as possible to heal the damage we've done to our bodies, but when I feel like hell at four in the morning and don't have the patience to cook something proper, something about microwaveable spicy ramen soothes my symptoms. I'm no neuroscientist, but I've heard that spicy foods release endorphins, which I think is what happens for me, because I usually do feel a little better after that specific meal.

3. *Try putting an IcyHot anywhere on your back*. I discovered this comfort on accident, but again, it consistently brings me at least mild relief. If you buy some IcyHots, or something similar, and put one on when your symptoms are acting up, you might find that the sensation both soothes and distracts you. The more ideal version of this--for those of you who have significant others or very good friends or relatives--is also to have someone lightly rub your back or head.

4. *If you feel decent early in the day, going for a walk might stave off PAWS later*. I've noticed that if I go on a walk within a few hours of waking up, I tend to have milder symptoms throughout the day. More rigorous exercise like jogging, I've noticed, is a gamble. Sometimes it makes me feel great and alert, while other times it doubles my symptoms later on.

None of these is a promise, obviously, and the relief they bring is at best moderate, but if, as I imagine, some of you are suffering like I am, then you're probably glad for whatever breaks you can catch.

Best of luck to everyone!",20
