As of last night I was scouring this and other groups for some information and I‚Äôm a bit overwhelmed. A little about me‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going to be 50 this year and I‚Äôve been addicted to some sort of stimulant for about 25 years. The first 10 it was meth, smoking around an 8-ball a day. I got clean, stayed that way for about 4 years. My daughter was prescribed Ritalin and the doctor suggested it would help me too, I used it relatively as prescribed for about a year before I really went full force. I started getting it off the street in addition to my prescription and almost lost my job. I stayed off about a year and got back on so for about the last 10 years we‚Äôll say I‚Äôve gone back and forth between stages of crazy abuse and more controlled abuse. Currently I have a prescription for adderall, 90 10mg pills monthly but usually take most of my daughters Ritalin prescription as well. 

I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard all this before‚Ä¶
When I try to stop I don‚Äôt last more than time to get my next refill. I‚Äôm the only one supporting my family and I have my own business and I‚Äôll be starting a new one next week. This last week of work really did me in. I have a little more to get done this weekend. 

I can‚Äôt live like this anymore. I‚Äôm letting down my family, my clients and as I was laying there trying to rest last night, all of the denial I‚Äôve been fooling myself with became apparent. I really want to give this up. For what it‚Äôs worth, I do have ADHD. I have a job in the community that really precludes me from getting help publicly, although I‚Äôm starting to realize I can‚Äôt use that as an excuse. I do have to support my family financially though. I can possibly take a week off but I‚Äôm really going to need a plan that can help me get out of bed and at least do the minimum for awhile. 

I probably have about 6 pills left ( btw, I crush and snort them) this time my prescription lasted less than a week. I‚Äôll stay up for days on end and really have no control over my use. Stress makes it worse. 

Unfortunately most of the time, my abuse has been rewarded. At least professionally.  My marriage is on the rocks‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre currently separated and I‚Äôm not sure if I use more because I‚Äôm unhappy in my marriage or the other way around. My spouse enables a lot of my behavior and would take me back in a heartbeat. I feel guilty about it, but so far not guilty enough to change.

I genuinely don't know how to feel about it. I've been doing all this research but articles don't help I need to hear from real people's experiences. I'm scared I'm making the wrong decisions or that meds aren't for me, as I have an obsessive personality I'm scared I'll become addicted. 

I'm on a 30mg dose of Elvanse, for about nearly 2 months. I honestly don't know if it works or even makes a difference? Somedays I'm like yeah I can tell the difference  and then others I just don't. When I didn't take it one day I was just lethargic and couldn't find the motivation to do the things I wanted to do, or do the chores that needed to be done. But sometimes I feel too jittery when I take them. But I've felt those ways long before I was even diagnosed. So to me, I just can't tell? 

I'm scared I'll become tolerant and ill suffer addiction and side effects. I want to increase my dose to see if I feel a difference, but I'm scared I'll become tolerant or dependant. 

I just feel hopeless. I know its not the same as street drugs but the properties are still the same. 

Can anyone tell me the difference or what it feels like to be on a too high dose? Or to addicted to it? Or what euphoria feels like? Or what it feels to be on a stimulant for someone who isn't diagnosed with adhd?

We in the mod team on our Discord server have been discussing the idea of having a mentor/sobriety buddy program, somewhat similar to the support an NA/AA sponsor would give to their sponsorees . This mentor would be someone a recovering addict could call/message whenever they feel the urge to use or relapse but want to be talked out of it, or during stressful times, etc. It could potentially involve contact outside of Discord at the discretion of the mentor and mentoree. Mentors will be carefully chosen, be expected to follow an ethical code of conduct in their relationship with mentorees and require at least one year of clean time. Would anyone here be interested in either being a mentor or having a mentor to message during difficult times, if we had such a program here? 

This would only be for quitting stimulants. Quitting other drugs would also be great, but not necessarily required by the program.

Also, this would not involve working the 12 steps or anything like that. This is our own thing we're considering doing here.

If you are indeed interested, please state whether you would be interested in being a mentor, a mentoree, or just interested in having the program in general (or not interested at all.)

ELEVEN MONTHS off Adderall

Yesterday was a very positive day and it ended with the notification that I am 11 months clean from Adderall.

I‚Äôm very vulnerable and emotional.
Mornings are very difficult. I wake up missing my GF who out of nowhere cut me out of her life (I researched and I strongly believe she has Borderline Personality Disorder).

I want to hear from her so bad. I don‚Äôt know how I became so emotionally dependent on this person. 

For these eleven months I have been unmotivated and undriven in my creative work and my career. People have been contacting me to start projects üíµ and I‚Äôm slowly starting again but like I mentioned earlier, getting my day started takes forever.

I took a part time job at Target to force myself out of the house and to be around people and that has helped immensely with alleviating the strong feelings of loneliness and depression.

I don‚Äôt necessarily crave Adderall, I just crave the feeling of feeling excited about life. I guess for 5 years I was artificially creating that feeling by popping an Adderall immediately upon waking up.

I‚Äôve had a decent amount of moments where I‚Äôm fully functional and social without drugs so that is positive.

I have a LOT of anxiety in my stomach constantly and I attribute that to being completely confused about my future (career, relationship, finances -- etc).

Also, This month I passed the TWO YEAR mark of quitting my nasty addiction to Kratom.

I think I‚Äôm going to start journaling again because it seems to help my mood when I get all of these thoughts out of my head.

As you can probably tell by my writing, my mind is jumping all over the place.

I am looking forward to being completely sober for the holidays. I have PTSD about Thanksgiving because that is my sober anniversary for Adderall and that was my rock bottom. I really miss my best friend / GF but I am strong because I have made it this far with basically only the verbal support from my parents. These past eleven months have been a completely awful emotional and physical prison sentence.

I need to get the unstoppable drive back that I had when taking Adderall. One thing is for sure though, I do not miss being stuck in a stimulated state (i.e. cracked out). Nothing is permanent and things will change for the better.

No longer able to take medication as prescribed?,"At the end of my use I found myself taking an entire script of Methyhenidate, Vyvanse in 2-3 days/nights. I would be able to take close to a half gram or so in one night. Doses were mixed with Kratom and Cannabis mostly. Towards the end I started to notice with Concerta that I would get bad chest pains associated and eventually shortness of breath and palpitations. I figured that I was simply taking wayyyy to much ( I was, obvs) and if I cut down or simply took the dose prescribed ( I have horrible terrible ADHD) the negative cardiovascular effects would subside. This was not the case. At the end I was experiencing the same negative chest pains that I would after binging a gram in two nights, just from taking 10mg or so. I then thought well maybe the Vyvanse would not have the same effect if taken as directed.. This was not the case. 10-20 mgs of Vyvanse had the same effect. Same with Focalin. These are substances that I took and abused for 10 years in very high dosages and dangerous combinations, with zero to little noticeable immediate adverse reactions. Now any stimulant I take even in the smallest dose prescribed I get very cardiovascular issues. I am waiting on  seeing the cardiologist next month. Chest ray and EKG came back with zero issues. I am convinced that I did some type of irreversible damage. I understand that anxiety can cause this and very significantly but this is 100% different. The second I would take a dose it would start and then for a few days after chest pains would continue. After a few days off they would subside.      


Does anyone have any experience with this? I understand no one can diagnose anything over the internet but any wisdom would be amazing. I'm not looking to hear that I'm fine or anything specific, I just want to get to the bottom of this, whatever the truth may be.  


 If nothing else let this be a warning, please. I injected meth for many years and abused all the stims there were with zero effects. Then all of a sudden after a binge on methlyphenidate, it all changed. I really need to be on this medication and when I finally started taking it normally my life changed for the best and my ADHD was finally being addressed. Now I no longer have the option of taking a stimulant. I never thought anything like this could happen to me, nor did I have any awareness this could happen to anyone really. But here we are.

Was wondering what you guys would recommend for my situation - I am obviously trying to stop using drugs, esp stims. My DOC is cocaine but I have pretty much zero self control when it comes to any stim lol. I don't consider myself to have a true alcohol problem (would be nice to drink, but I'm doing OK without), but the moment I start drinking the drug cravings become overwhelming and I completely forget the reason I want to stop using stims in the first place. Long term it would be cool if I could drink and smoke weed again, but I have enough mental health issues to deal with for now without adding any substances into the mix.

The thing I'm most nervous about is that I haven't hit an objectively low rock bottom - I've maintained a good job, didn't use daily, etc., so I feel like I'm overdoing it by going to one of these groups? I kind of have to rebuild my life after partying nonstop almost every weekend or multiple times a week, and I think the community support would be really helpful.

This is my first time posting on reddit like this, I just need some guidance. Here's my situation: I have been prescribed 20mgXR of Adderall for the past few years and have been doing well. Last year, I started experimenting with taking double and very rarely triple my regular dosage to get work done. Now, in my freshmen year of college, I've been swamped with work and naively saw Adderall as a risk-free solution to get myself to grind in the library. I kept upping the dosage, basically saying ""fuck it"", I need to do this work. The highest amount I took in a day was 120mg, SIX times my prescribed dose. 

I realize now that if I keep it up my tolerance will screw me over when I can't always take that much and I would run out in time anyway. Now, it is even harder to focus without any Adderall and I'm afraid my normal dosage won't have the same effect it did before. I feel lazy, hopeless, and dumb as fuck without Adderall. 

I'd appreciate any advice, guidance, or words or wisdom or support. Thanks",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7680019}"

I've tried going clean before, tho it didn't worked out before my social cycle did a 180 degree rotation. Last time I went cold turkey in spring and since then I was clean from amph. Solitude, exercise and learning something new everyday showed me a different path I could've been going all this time instead of being a junkie.

There were countless possibilities for me to not make it until this point. I was getting heart attacks when I first started exercise (was skinny af, 58kg back then) and I bet I could've not battled out Covid successfully if I still was using today. Mental health took a hit too, I went from being diagnosed depression/anxiety before the addiction to bipolar diagnosis, but I'm learning to live with it. Things are better now and I'm in a better shape.

But recently I noticed, that caffeine, cigarettes and lack of sleep can easily bring me back into that same mindset  which you have when going binge. Last couple of days I had lucid dreams showing me my ex-girl which I was with since our teen years and drugs. Today I even felt a smeel of powder before I woke up, which I thought I'd forget long ago. Told about this to my relatives and they confessed I was calling my ex by her name yeasterday at night.

I don't quite understand why it's happening and I'm blind to see where it can took me. 6 months mark are very close and I'm afraid somehow I can make a very wrong decision which I don't really want to happen.

But I‚Äôm ok. In fact, I‚Äôm much more than ok. I have acceptance around the situation. I understand and own my part in it. And I accept my powerlessness over their mum and her feelings and actions. While it got really tough at times this weekend, I turned to the tools and practices that have helped me get and stay clean. I prayed. I meditated. I went to meetings. I swam in the ocean. I spoke to other addicts in recovery. I hugged my wife. I spoke to my Dad. I played with my 11 month old and shared  moments of pure joy with him.

And I got through it. I took the right actions around the boys not coming. I responded appropriately. In a measured way without doing or saying anything I now regret. And I experienced another level of acceptance and letting go around my situation with my kids. Acceptance that it‚Äôs gonna take a long time and I need to be patient. And that all I can really do right now in this moment - is be ok within myself and available for them whenever they need me.

Which I am. Because I‚Äôm meth free. Because I‚Äôm in recovery and no longer driven by impulsiveness and irrational overly emotional thinking.

Long story short, that didn't work out too well, and I relapsed on monday, but that's not the point of this post.

Yesterday (this'd be two days after my last use) when I got to school, I started flapping my hands. This is normal for me; I have diet autism (adhd) so it's kinda just a thing I do sometimes. The issue arose when I was simply unable to stop for hours. My teacher made me go see the nurse since I literally couldn't hold my pencil still enough to write or draw (it was an art class). Eventually it just kinda...went away...but it was really bizarre and unlike anything I'd experienced before. And I should qualify that this hand flapping was like really fast and hard, to the point where my hand would often be a blur just twitching back and forth.

Is this a withdrawal symptom? I can't think of what else it could be, besides just mental illness, and the timing seems to imply it's related, but when I was looking at articles describing adderall withdrawal, nothing like that was ever mentioned.

I‚Äôve been going through a tough time with PAWS and lack of motivation. I‚Äôm pretty depressed and I have ADHD and depression which I‚Äôm dealing with now after 10 years of abusing Adderall and finally quitting. 

I had a few months of what I would describe as sober bliss, I felt like myself again and I was riding my bike and laughing and enjoying time with friends and just being ALIVE for the first time in a long time. That has since worn off and I‚Äôve been feeling sluggish, depressed, anxious, a bit dead inside. But I‚Äôm determined to get through it. 

Anyway, most of my family doesn‚Äôt know (except my sister, who is an ex-meth user, and my dad, who I‚Äôm very close to), but recently I was visiting my grandma and grandpa who I absolutely adore and they told me something wonderful. They said ‚Äúyou seem to be at peace.‚Äù Wow. I have no idea how I seemed before, but I guarantee my speedy, tweaked out self wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù or enjoyable to be around. Even though sometimes I miss being her. So that was really nice to hear from some people I love very much. Just thought I‚Äôd share. 

Love to each and every one of you. This sub helped save my life.",101,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.8519161}"

Yesterday I turned a corner a bit - I thought to myself that I want to be off and this is my chance. I have an Adderall prescription that refills on the 12th. For reference, I was a benzodiazepines addict but worked with my doctor and now I take it as prescribed. That was a huge hurdle. Due to logistics and paperwork, I don't think the same solution is available for my Adderall. My DoC is street based but for privacy I don't want to call it out. 

Has anyone made it accidentally or by someone getting rolled? I really think this is my shot at turning things around. The Adderall will feel really strong at first as I imagine my tolerance will be way down, so I need a plan on what to do when I refill that medication (I do have legit ADHD but Strattera caused significant, gross side effects and Wellbutrin turns my mouth into hell on Earth. Modafinil may be an option). I feel like I can make it off the hard stuff, I had a dream my supplier called and I just told him I quit.

Going into details is irrelevant, use your imagination. Lost my marriage, lost multiple jobs, friends, my truck, almost my house.

And then ironically enough I lost the good feeling that came with using. I had an outer body experience, possibly a clairecognizant experience. But now I eat well, meditate, and just cling to the present while chipping away at short term and mid term goals.

1st week: 
had my first and only meeting with an addiction specialist counselor thing. It was the only meeting because I didnt have enough motivation to be committed. (Sorry for ghosting you counselor)

I was extremely tired. Slept nearly every day this week. My cravings were so strong that I started crying but my counselor brought up how your brain will trick you into *needing* adderall. My brain was telling me that I needed it because I felt lonely, pathetic, and unmotivated without it. I pushed through and randomly called my friends (they are in the dark about my addiction).

Week 2:
My personality somewhat came back. I‚Äôm genuinely laughing more. I felt emotions again a little. I also slept really early at night too

Week 3: 
I relapsed on a pill i found in my baggie stash. I absolutely hated the feeling of coming down from that one pill. I‚Äôm not going to restart my week count due to that. Honestly, i know that if i restarted the count, my motivation to quit will be gone. 

This week, sleeping is very very hard for me. I would be in bed waiting to sleep and it made me want to hit up my dealer. 
I had a shit ton of anxiety this week. I felt alone. But I knew that it was better than actually being on the short high of drugs.

Gained 15 pounds.

Week 4:
Lost my appetite. Had to force food down my throat.
More anxiety and I had intrusive thoughts. It‚Äôs also a very stressful week for me. I actually got a job after the first week of sobrietyto keep myself busy. (It‚Äôs working)

Week 5: 
SO TIRED. FATIGUE 24/7. Its so hard to do normal tasks. Didnt shower for. 1 1/2 weeks. Barely brushed my teeth. Room is covered with trash and plates. 

I kept a jug of water in my room, kept trash bags EVERYWHERE so I wont throw my used tissues on the ground.

Week 6:
No motivation to do schoolwork. Forcing myself to do anything. I‚Äôve been restless.

Got CBD gummies to help with anxiety so I can sleep at night. Its meh. I woke up dehydrated for several nights and would only give me 4 hours of sleep before I woke up randomly.

Lost 10 pounds.

Overall:
Despite every negative thing, I would take it over a short lived high with major consequences ANY DAY. I slipped up week 3, but it doest take away from the progress i‚Äôve made as long as I know that I will continue to do better and be better. It took a lot of me forgiving myself from the guilt and hurt that ive had, and im definitely still working on it. 6 weeks doesnt seem long, but compared to my  past usage, im proud as hell",26,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.685184}"

I‚Äôm just over 14 months clean from a decade-long Adderall addiction and I can‚Äôt begin to describe how much it has improved my life.


However, things aren‚Äôt perfect (obviously) and I still find myself craving it from time to time. Especially whenever I gain weight, which is probably my biggest trigger because it took me so long to lose the weight I put on from quitting.


Also when things are tough at work, or if I‚Äôm going out to a party. I imagine myself going to the pharmacy and getting my last refill just to take a few. It‚Äôs hard but I get over cravings pretty fast and then of course am happy I didn‚Äôt give in.


Anyway the past few weeks I have noticed people in my life getting prescribed Adderall for the first time. And being really vocal and happy about it.


It drives me craaaazy because the first year on it was SO fucking crazy and fun and I was skinny and wild and I do get pangs of nostalgia for that time. Like it sounds weird but I miss trying to take a bite of food, getting full in 20 seconds, and going straight for a cigarette instead. I would sit in the library for hours listening to classical music and acing calculus homework, or chain smoke while translating Italian poetry. I really romanticize that period of my addiction (the rest was utter fucking shit).


Anyway idk ugh I just needed to rant I guess. Like I don‚Äôt want to read long-winded texts from my newly diagnosed sister because I can tell she‚Äôs on her meds. And it makes me jealous and annoyed and tired. And I especially don‚Äôt want to see Instagram posts of acquaintances talking about their ADHD diagnosis and every detail of what they did on their day 1 of Adderall.


Like I DONT FUCKING CARE but no clearly I do and until now I didn‚Äôt have to deal with people doing Adderall around me. I just came to this sub daily, read positive stories of quitting, and never had to hear about it in a positive light.


I mean I don‚Äôt know if everybody just got burnt out working from home and realized they have focus issues but god it is triggering as fuck.

I started taking dextroamphetamine infrequently about 3 years ago to treat ADHD and excessive tiredness (I am narcoleptic). I was prescribed 10mg IR 4x a day. I didn't use every day only when I felt I needed to concentrate more so than normal. I started using more frequently within the following years and for the last year I started taking low doses, 5-10mg a daily which helped for a while but gradually became ineffective and detrimental to my mental health. I should also mention, I have always struggled with severe anhedonia and depression which the dextroamphetamine certainly appeared to help at first but later exacerbated. 

In two days it will be a month since I stopped taking the d-amp.  I'm not experiencing much excess tiredness but my anhedonia has peaked in severity and my concentration is absolutely horrendous. I am trying to eat well, get enough sleep (though it's poor quality), and exercise lightly. 

I know it's a long road ahead but can anybody share their experience on regaining some ability to concentrate? I know that it will take a while for my dopamine receptors to return to homeostasis but what worries me is that my concentration will, at best, return to a pre-amphetamine state which is not acceptable. 

Any suggestions on improving concentration without medication?

Everyone‚Äôs at a different stage in their addiction and everyone has different paths, triggers, thoughts, ect.

This one was really unexpected. I‚Äôm pretty comfortable with even being offered it and saying no, which happens rarely because my people know I‚Äôm clean now. I‚Äôm a firm believer in ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt run from your problems, because they will find you‚Äù.  When I‚Äôm comfortable knowing I‚Äôll be around it or I know I might be offered in early stages and have no issues turning down (realistically no issues) I know I‚Äôm in a good spot. Now sometimes you might have to tear yourself away from situations to keep yourself safe and that‚Äôs perfectly fine. My tactic is don‚Äôt let the thought sit in your head at all. 

The classic going through stuff and I come across a forgotten bag. First thought, oh shit  that‚Äôs not cool to have around I better go rinse that out and trash it ( after examining it ).

That‚Äôs where I fucked up is examining it I think. I set it down on the floor where I am and finish my project. I come back to it and I consider what it would be like to do it. It won‚Äôt hurt that little bit, I‚Äôm strong willed now. I put it away and go across town and even voice to my friend later about me being tempted.

Well a week later and I just realized it‚Äôs still there. So I‚Äôm thinking why? What do I hope to get out of it? All it does it keep me from being bored and all this sober time has made me realize that being bored can be healthy. Being high all the time kept me content on just doing stupid bullshit for months on end. I get high now and I‚Äôll keep getting high because it‚Äôs a cheap thrill to keep me busy. But not the right kind of busy. 

Since I‚Äôve cleaned up I‚Äôve strengthen my personal relationships ( well I didn‚Äôt purposefully mean to, it was just a positive side effect I noticed ) and I finally enrolled in college while I‚Äôve been putting off for years. All good stuff. 

I‚Äôm just venting and maybe hoping to help another person through there struggles as well. 

Thanks for listening. 

BONUS STORY: So I went to meet up with someone that I had made a deal with while I was fucked off and I went to cash in on it. They had been avoiding me so I went to their house and surprised them. Long story short they fed me this long STUPID FARFETCHED story about why they didn‚Äôt have everything included on my item I was promised and HAD I BEEN STILL HIGH I most likely would have believed that story. 

I was just super grateful to have a sober head to be able to sort that bullshit out right away. To be fair some of it might have had true elements to it which goes with the territory but all and all‚Ä¶.y‚Äôall fucked my shit off and you can‚Äôt convince me otherwise.",7,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43938258}"

2021-10-09 19:19:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/q4wgap/flushed_that_fucking_shit/,Flushed that fucking shit,"3 months ago I‚Äôve relapsed to abusing Ritalin IR -mostly snorting- , my scholarship at university was about be cut off due to a mistaken attendance  report. I was mentally so prepared for that fresh start of semester after quitting my poly drug addiction -Xanax for comedowns, ibuprofen for the headaches and sore throat, anti acid medications, antipsychotics‚Ä¶ basically anything to just fucking enjoy Ritalin-. 


Since that 3 months I don‚Äôt know how many prescriptions I binged in. Almost 60-80 mg daily usage and I wasn‚Äôt even getting high or being productive on it like I used to when I first started it. Tho it cleared that I still have my scholarship, I wasted 3 weeks of the curriculum hating myself, chasing the imaginary dragon, going to raves, meeting people then not talking any single one of them back after‚Ä¶ 

It took tonight for me to give the decision to flush the rest of my prescription. I relapsed on a bing purge episode, completely isolated myself at my room but while wanting to be social, I couldn‚Äôt even look at myself in the mirror anymore. It was after that I throw up and looked at myself, truly looked at myself to stop killing myself slowly. My dark circles, my watery eyes, my enlarged pores but mostly the emotions showing adding all those details together. I heard my intuition, my higher self crying for help. 

I got so much to lose. My professors are worried about me because they see my potential, there are people listening, my mom paying for my therapy sessions, my friends telling me that they want me to be happy, my cat, my lovely sister, my hard earned degree, my body and my mind that I so hardly built up before all of this started.

I am never going back. This is day 0, again. I know self loathing, guilt, PAWS, depressive episodes are waiting for me but I now acknowledge the strength I have against them. They are not going to win.

I don‚Äôt need to learn to love myself. I need to practice it. 


There must be a reason for me to still surviving, if I failed all of my suicide attempts as a child, because I was convinced my psychopathic father was going to do it anyway. I survived earthquakes, I survived changing cities every 4 years growing up because my family was in military, I survived watching my mom going through intense PTSD after one night we finally escaped my father. I survived the man that I was damn sure to have my life with abandon me at the abortion clinic and her mom dying out of cancer.

Anyhow, standard story, I started abusing the Adderall, snorting it, binging it, stim fapping, etc. I ultimately stopped doing all the stims around January, stopped drinking alcohol in April, and went to an outpatient rehab in May. I have been sober since then.

My energy level still feels low. I don't have a job, and I feel like I don't get anything accomplished during the day. I'm sleepy and generally unmotivated, compared to how I was when taking the stimulant medication.

I feel like I'm in a purgatory. The ADHD meds did seem effective, but I did abuse them. I don't think I should start taking them again, but now I'm stuck with the ""untreated ADHD"" lifestyle, which sucks.

It's like I fucked up and got my stim card pulled, so now I'm stuck mulling around, yawning, stuck with the consequences.

All this said, I'm also aware that most recovering addicts having cravings for their former drugs, so I'm also aware my pining for stims could be drug-wanting.

I'm wondering if there is anyone out there who has successfully quit after daily, long term use. Yesterday I turned 42. I started doing meth when I was 22. For the most part, compared to other users around me, I manage to keep it together which I used to think was a blessing but now I know it's a curse. Maybe if I'd lost everything, or wound up in jail or lost my job - I'd have quit sooner and I'd be done with the stuff. But fortunately/unfortunately that hasn't been the case. I despise dope and want to quit. I wish I could remember what living life felt like without it. I hate being tied down to the stuff and worrying about getting it and it's annoying how much money I've spent on it. I hate lying to everyone around me. Only a handful of people who know me, know I'm an addict. I've tried countless times to stop and the longest I've quit was nearly 2 years but at that point I'd been using for 7 years. Now I've been using for I dunno 15? 18 years? I'm super scared about stopping because I hate feeling so bad. I know everyone feels bad and I'm probably just being a baby. I mean, I guess I have it good compared to people trying to kick heroin but whenever I stop it's just so unbearable. My entire life goes to hell. I stop working. The bills start racking up. I feel depressed and stressed over that stuff. It just gets worse until something real bad is going to happen like were going to lose our house or something then, inevitably, I go get on one and get myself back on track, but I'm not really on track because I'm still using. 

This has happened the last few times I've quit. I honestly feel so hopeless over this like I can't do it. But then I see other people who have. Like my own husband quit dope and became a helicopter pilot. I feel so proud of him and I feel like he deserves a better wife who isn't on drugs.  I feel a lot of guilt over it all and just like what's my problem? Why am I still doing this? Anyway. I was hoping there's someone out there who has had success after long term use because it's so hard for me to imagine myself in that place right now.

Hi everyone, 
So, a little background. I previously was sober for 7 years and was/am certified as a drug and alcohol counselor. Meth is all new to me, started last November. I got a about a month off in June, then relapsed. I can either detox at my new place or go to a psych ward/ detox. 

Right now I‚Äôm in an extended stay, it‚Äôs 6:20am and I woke up yesterday at 4ish. Today I have to check out at noon, mind you I have been living in hotels for the entirety of these 3 months so I have a ton of stuff. I have yet to be able to sleep and have done very little (for me) since I woke up. When I shoot up I do about .7 in a shot to feel it at all. My tolerance is very high. At this point I think I just have to stay up. I have a 6 1/2 hour drive today back home. Then to another hotel before I get my keys tomorrow. Also tomorrow the movers come. Long ass day. I will have enough to maintain until after the movers. 

Here‚Äôs my dilemma, when I come down/ detox I get very suicidal. So, initially I planned on going to a psych hospital to stop. The only real thing stopping that is that I don‚Äôt want my mom to know yet. And I have a number of doctors appointments and an appointment with my lawyer for a case on the 21st. I could reschedule all of those probably. My psychiatrist is an addiction psychiatrist so I could email her fit ambulatory detox (at home). But then the mental health is concerning. 

I currently take supplements to make up for what I depleted during my use and psych meds. I plan on getting a lot of bud too to help. I generally go through a Teener to a ball a day.

I'd take 100-150mg of XR Adderall and then go to town for the next 12 hours.

2 days ago I somehow unknowingly and fucking stupidly took 300mgs within the span of 6 hours.

I've been wired since then and have been fapping non stop this whole weekend and now the comedown is finally starting and I feel like I want to die. 

I dont want to do this anymore. I hate it. I hate who it makes me be. 

I am an addict and am willing to admit it. I need help stopping.

I never even needed adderall in the first place but because of that incorrect diagnosis I never spoke up , so basically it's been like straight meth for me.

I feel like my dopamine levels are never going to be fixed ever.

Honestly it hasn't been too bad so far: been to the gym every day i was off work to fill out my days and I've been working on music and eating properly.

The thing is this is how it always goes for me, super determined in the beginning and it fizzles out over time. Today is the first day I've noticed my drug addict mindset starting to pull strings at me again. I can feel the cravings and excitement start to creep in as the drug (4mmc) crosses my mind every now and again. I fear as time goes on my will to quit will degrade as cravings and reminiscing increase.

At the moment i couldn't satisfy my temptations even if i wanted due to being virtually broke (payday is closing in) and i can only afford to feed myself at work.  I've drawn up next months spending plan and picking up would for sure jeopardise some of the things i want to put my income to next month so i really hope i can keep it together.

You're just standing there with dead eyes and a stiff nervous smile... Or perhaps no emotion at all

I remember now it's actually connecting gazes which links your emotions and you become receptive to what they will tell you verbally and non verbally. It's non judgemental pauses that don't need to be filled, it's smiling without being aware of it. It's odd that this has been a realisation.

I'm so heartbroken right now. I 32F found out my husband 33M of 6 years has been secretly smoking meth for most of this year. 

We had a baby in the spring, turns out he had been using for a few months before that. 

I had been having a lot of mental health issues during the end of my pregnancy and the first few months post partum. During the time I could've used the most emotional support he kept becoming more distant to keep me from finding out. So naturally my anxiety and hormone riddled brain thought I was the problem, but it turns out it was him. He had become more and more erratic after baby arrived and eventually had a full mental breakdown. He claims that was unrelated to the meth use, but I can't trust him. He has a history of drug abuse and addiction, and other than medical marijuana had been clean and sober for almost 15 years. I've always known him to say he'd never mess with meth. He even told me this while he was lying to me. 

Since this has been out in the open he keeps saying how he was hiding it because he was ashamed of it and now he doesn't want me to tell anyone because he's embarrassed. But then immediately tells me how he's fine when using it and how careful he is to not get caught, basically defending the drug and his usage. I told him I don't like it and how upset I was that he had it in the house and used while he was on kid duty. 

He says he feels better that I know now because he doesn't have to hide it from me and could be open when he was going to use. One night he asked to have sex after he used and when I said I didn't feel comfortable with it he got mad, saying I was punishing him by withholding sex. He thinks I'm overreacting.

What really hurts is that one of the things that really drew me to him was his honesty, he can't keep any surprises because it feels like lying. He doesn't even like acting like Santa and the tooth fairy are real because he doesn't want the kids to not trust him. He was the only person in my life that I truly trusted. I don't know what to do at this point. The thought of leaving is devastating. I still love him dearly but this is something I don't want to have in my or my children's lives. I don't know if I'm looking for advice or just screaming into the void. My heart just *hurts*

So we‚Äôve got that going for us which is nice ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but fuck man is this worse than any of the other times. Idk if he was just deeper into it or if he didn‚Äôt ‚Äúreally‚Äù detox before, but we‚Äôre at the point that I can‚Äôt even sleep in bed with him because he‚Äôs constantly freaking out over how hot my skin is against or even near his and he can‚Äôt take it. Sensitive to light, sensitive to sound, night terrors, sleep paralysis; he‚Äôs gone from couch to bed and back again for three days now and is an absolute shell. I barely slept last night because he kept waking me up telling me ‚Äúthey‚Äù were going to take his soul and I told him each time that I would protect him, I was there for him, and like clockwork every half hour we reset. 

Idk what I‚Äôm doing. Idk if this is a support post or just a vent because I _can‚Äôt talk to anyone I know about this anymore_ under threat of some very bad consequences for me and I just ‚Äî- fucking fuck. Idk if anyone is reading or following this progression at all but I need someone to talk to. This sucks. That‚Äôs all.",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.9621538}"
