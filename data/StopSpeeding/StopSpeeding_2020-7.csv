I also notice a huge increase in confidence and in being outgoing. I am normally a guarded and self-isolating person but when I take Adderall it helps me really connect with my support circle when I would otherwise isolate. I feel some shame and guilt for using this when I don’t have ADHD, and I have social anxiety and embarrassment related to how outgoing and excited I am when taking Adderall. I am wondering if the anxiety, shame, and guilt are worth the productivity and social bravery that I get out of it. What do you guys think?",3

2020-07-29 22:47:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/i0e9me/tw_relapsed_after_six_months_clean/,[TW] Relapsed after six months clean,"So back in January I made the decision to get off the junk. Weekends turned into weekdays turned into every day and I tried to get off the shit for a month before I realized I couldn't do it on my own. Ended up getting grimy and I tried IV use for the first time and was disgusted with myself afterwards. Came clean to my dad and decided to get help. Relapsed day 1 in IOP and ended up having to commit myself after a manic spell that ruined my credit. Marchman acted into rehab which was completely unnecessary and lost me my job, I had already made the decision to quit and was super confident and excited for the future. 20 years old with an awesome job, my own place, and a newly kicked dope habit. There was so much on the horizon.

I rotted away in rehab. My mental state dropped off into the lowest of lows, lost all of my motivation and hope and a dream of a job, got super fat and just felt all around horrible. Went straight into a halfway house after a three month stint in rehab, it was a good program but I had everything I needed from it after the first week. Depression set in hard and I was basically immobile for like three more months, pitiful attempts to get a job or do chores around the house failed at every step. They say it gets better, and I did feel better after the six month mark, but jesus fucking christ it wasn't better enough to make a difference.

Fucked up even more financially, blew my tax return in a week and loaned hundreds of dollars to a friend from rehab. He's using heroin but nobody knows. We've lent eachother money and paid it back and bought eachother food, we were tight. Still are. But one day he offered me meth. I turned him down. He shot up his 20 in my truck, just to taper off of course. But the seed was planted.

Next day the deed was done. I tried reaching out and I tried to stop myself, and I ran into roadblock after roadblock trying to bum and trade for the dope and had so many chances to turn back. But I was like a zombie, just going through the motions. I'd stop myself and pace around for a few minutes and slowly work my way out to the car to go contact a dealer. Ended up being past midnight by the time I copped, and I was swinging out the gate.

I'm so fucking sick and tired of not being able to get out of bed. Being the unemployed fuck who plays video games till the wee hours of the morning and runs a junkie uber service for gas money. I'm sick of getting bills in the mail from collectors that I'm too afraid to call knowing damn well I can't pay. So fucking sick of being fat and tired and lazy and borderline retarded and not being able to put together coherent thoughts like I used to. Is it worth it to stay clean when you can't do your duties as a man?

And you know what, best decision I ever made. I got good as fuck. I railed molly fent h and ice, rolled the bowl all night long, drank and sang and hit a laced J and carpetsurfed for hours and helped my tweaker buddy pack up his house in the dark because he has no electricity and got robbed. I felt fucking fantastic.

Got home just in time to take my housemate to work, let them chatter about me being ""out all night"" and see if I give a fuck. I spent the day seeing clearly, speaking clearly, cracking jokes, running a to-do list. Getting chores out of the way that I've been putting off for weeks.

I went out to celebrate with some friends after they picked up their six month chips and I was cracking jokes even making the servers laugh. And I didn't fucking overeat for the first time in months. Now one of the girls wants to fuck me on the DL and I'm so fucking lonely.

I feel more in control than I have since the day I got admitted to rehab.

And I know that it's all a lie. I know that when the rocks wear off they start whispering, louder and louder the longer I let this go on until I fall apart again and everyone sees. But I need it, I want it more than anything else in the world. I need to be able to move.",26

I kept it a secret all this time and its been starting to eat me up inside when i’ve been going overboard ever since the pandemic started. I told my best friend of 13 years today and I felt very relieved. No judgement in the room, and she will be helping me as well. Im tired of taking adderrall all the time, drinking everyday, and sometimes even mixing all two along with weed if i’m bored. 

She’s giving me support to see a therapist and she’ll be there for me if i feel like relapsing. Overall, im glad that I have a friend who doesn’t give me judgement. I’m calling it quits and it’s about time for me to stop.

We recently went on a trip to a lake house (came back yesterday) and afterwards she texted me and asked if I was okay since I was acting different (not the same energy, keeping to myself, sleeping a lot) . Thats when reality hit. When your personality and excitement changes; even worse when people close to you notices a difference with your vibes.

2020-07-29 17:59:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/i09ozk/back_2_work/,Back 2 work,"I use to take 80-240mg of Adderall XR for 4.5 years. I quit cold turkey 3 months ago, and after a hospital visit this week- I was given a new script and have been back on 40mg XR.

I now understand and remember why I quit. The Adderall high is like no other- it's amazing, but you can't have the high without the crash that comes after. Along with the many other unpleasant side effects. The bad outweighs the good every time, and it's just not sustainable.

I got a new job and I start on Monday. I want to flush my new script before things start to spiral again and before I totally kill all the progress I made. Adderall withdrawal is unbearable- even after 3 months. I am so tired of being tired and depressed, but the only way out is through. And I can't stay on Adderall forever.

I remember being a beast at work and outshining all my coworkers. I was productive, efficient, and could work all day long and take on more if needed. I have to now go back into the workplace sober, without my Adderall crutch and I'm freaking out. How have you all coped being at work and not being as productive as you have been while on Adderall? Do you have enough energy to complete your workday? Were you able to concentrate and get things done without the Adderal? How do you adapt to the change?

I have 5 am shifts and I am not sure how I will be able to stay energized in the mornings without Adderall. I don't know how I will adapt to the fast-paced environment. I have badass social anxiety and that's a huge part of the fear that comes with being unmedicated at work.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated

Thanks <3

&#x200B;

Edit: I have been back to work for 4 days and completely sober. all I needed to do was show myself that I could do it. It's not easy, it's not fun like it use to be, but it is much, much better than I expected. I am so proud of myself for stepping out, afraid, and showing myself that it can be done.",6

2020-07-28 17:15:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/hzn8uv/is_mild_depression_2mos_after_stopping_adderall/,Is mild depression ~2mos after stopping Adderall normal?,"I was prescribed 20mg Adderall a couple years ago and initially took it a couple times a week as needed. As is probably often the case my usage increased in frequency (although I mindfully never raised my dosage above 20mg as I knew tolerance builds quickly and didn't want to become overly dependent on it) - at one point a year ago I was taking it almost daily, on top of drinking coffee (probably way too much tbh), and could tell it was not going to do me any favors in the long run. I was in great shape and getting a lot done but I also felt ""wired"" and would have trouble sleeping, and just started to not feel like myself. I was angrier and less in touch with my feelings. I also remember having my blood pressure taken for a doctor visit once and it was like 140, which was way higher than normal and that freaked me out a bit... So I tapered back again to 3-4 times per week over the last year or so, and then about 2 months ago I just decided not to fill my prescription. By this point I was only taking it once or twice per week, and had switched from XR to IR.

I felt totally fine for the first month of not taking it, but 2-3 weeks ago I began to feel very fatigued and unmotivated. I would often feel this way on the comedown from adderall and/or alcohol (ie hangovers) - but it has persisted almost daily since then, which is unusual for me. 

I wake up feeling fine but as the day progresses I start to slip into a negative headspace where I just feel sad, fatigued and find myself withdrawing from family and friends through text etc. I'm not suicidal or anything really serious, but I just feel sad and lethargic. 

I can't tell if it's my brain still recovering from the drug, or if it's  feeling down and out due to the quarantine (I live alone), or if it could even be from cutting back on my alcohol consumption (found myself drinking too frequently at the start of the stay at home orders and last month I decided to give it up as well, so my only vice at the moment is 2 or 3 k-cups of coffee each morning).

My brain might just be used to stimulants and downers that it's no longer getting, but I was never abusing the adderall and I know 20mg isn't that crazy of a dose. I also have gone a month in recent past without alcohol and had no depression or side effects, so it seems odd that either of them would be causing it... But maybe because it's both at the same time?

I've thought about going to my doctor and telling him how I feel but I keep riding it out thinking it's probably normal. I was wondering if anyone else who's given up the stimulant can speak to similar effects, or if 2 months of being off it would be enough time to rule it out as causing the moodiness?",33

I haven't told them about my use, but they probably suspect something was up. At least I don't have such financial stress, but now I have the pressure from my parents of being a normal productive human being and getting back out into the world, but I'd really just rather die.

I know there are so many things that I should/could be doing, but I feel like I have zero fucking motivation ever when I'm not high. I thought it would eventually come back after being sober for a while, but I still feel hopeless and useless.

2020-07-24 14:45:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/hx7hs5/dilemma/,Dilemma,"I was addicted to speed for some years. I basically did it 24/7, combined with benzo's. After staying up for 3/4 days I would crash and sleep for days. Then the cycle would repeat. Went to rehab for 3 months and didn't use for almost 10 months (now I only drink alcohol sometimes). In rehab all the shitty feelings came back; loneliness, anxiety, fear of failure, low self-esteem etc. I have made some progress but I'm still struggling. I have a hard time actually doing useful things and making steps in life. One of the few things that gives me some self-worth is the fact that I'm going to college again.

I have severe ADHD and I have a lot of issues with focusing on stuff such as school work and other things that can be boring at times. I got diagnosed at 20, when shit basically hit the fan (I started using speed to focus at school and work, it was basically a tool for me to function). So in the first 19 years of my life I developed a lot of bad coping mechanisms to deal with this (extreme procrastination, OCD like behaviour to manage the chaos in my head, avoidance, addictive behaviour).

I had CBT for these issues (and ofcourse a lot of therapy and help for my general mental health in rehab) and I have been trying to improve my study skills but I definitely feel like I at least NEED some form of medication to focus and to function in life. The thing is, I tried a lot of meds. Including non-stimulants. The best med that I tried was Wellbutrin, but it simply isn't powerful enough to provide the focus and motivation that I need for boring tasks or school work etc. I'm currently on Vyvanse, and it gives me focus and motivation to do things. But it is quite similar to the drug that I was abusing (which was speed, here in Europe it's basically very cheap and dirty adderall). It is the most effective med that I have tried and it doesn't have a lot of side effects compared to for example ritalin, but it often feels kind of ""wrong"" to use it since it's so similar to speed.

Currently I'm prescribed a pretty high dose but I sometimes still take a pill more (usually when I think I'm starting to come down). When the comedown starts I feel really shitty and I always question the fact if I even should be on it (btw, I'm also using kratom, CBD, and some nootropics too to feel less ""speedy""). Next to that it also makes my OCD symptons a bit worse. I wish I could function without this substance but at the same time it scares me when I think about it, because I'm afraid I won't be able to function (there will be a big chance that I fuck up college, and then there is a big chance that I will start self-medicating again in some way to cope with this). If I'm not on any meds I am very passive, lazy and not very social, this makes me feel useless and quite depressed. Yes I do realise that taking more pills than prescribed, taking all kinds of supplements / nootropics next to that and drinking alcohol as an addict are red flags.

I'm not really sure why I'm writing this whole wall of text, I guess I just want to get if off my chest.

But yeah, ADHD meds as an addict: yes or no? What are your experiences with this? Do you have some tips, advice etc?

Btw, the physician that prescribes the medication is obviously aware of my history with addiction. We talked a lot about it but I do sometimes question his level of knowledge / experience with this subject (ADHD meds and addiction), thats why I'm asking your opinion instead of his. I'm also scared to address this issue because I'm afraid he will stop prescribing me this stuff (which I know is not a good sign).

&#x200B;

TL;DR: been to rehab for speed addiction. Currently prescribed stimulants for ADHD, which help but also trigger unhealthy behaviour. Don't know if I should continue because feel like I can't function without it.",5

After three years of being fine and getting my life together the rona happend.

I live somewhere heavily hit by the opiate epidemic. Meth doesn't exist here. Ive never had friends who used or a dealer, but let's just say no matter what I can get it. I lost my job from the virus and I guess the stir craziness got to me or something but I ended up relapsing.

Its getting to the point where I am seriously unhappy. I wasnt to worried before, but ife never used so heavily.

I'm moodier and have bouts of depression far worse than last time, my tolerence is through the roof. I can't do this. 

Nowhere accepts or knows how to treat meth addicts here. I tried a lot of thibgs and reached out to many resources, my wife and I are the only ones who can work on this. I may have a job opportunity foe a decent paying but honesrly terribly mundane factory job that starts very early. I want to quit the second ahat I have left runs out. But im nervous.

I'm not sure if i should take the job or wait a couple of weeks to get used to being off meth? Staying home isn't exactly great for my mental health either but, at leadt im comfortable and can sleep lol. Im nervous, already thinking of just hiding it from my wife again so she won't be nervous, but I do want to quit.

2020-07-22 10:06:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/hvudo0/in_case_you_need_even_more_reasons_to_stop_former/,In case you need even more reasons to stop. Former addict,"A few months ago I posted an image of a fancy self made crystal meth pipe which was almost shockproof. I was proud about it, as I knew that pipe would not break or ""rest"" from me for a VERY long time.

After a 2 year ALMOST non-stop rush on meth, I DECIDED to quit 6 months ago. As surprising as it may sound I was able to do it without hesitation and without benzos. Why? How? The reason may also be  the ""how to"". 

I just wanna put you in context to add to my credibility:
I live in Mexico, I've been related to bad people and also have been part of the problem myself. I've been arrested twice in the past 3 years for things not related to drugs. However, during this time I managed to meet some cartel people (profitable business, sadly). At the same time, I must say, that I've lived a priviledged life, nice house, private university studies, vacations on the regular, fancy shoes/clothes etc. I'm VERY knowledgeable on A LOT of drugs as I have abused, studied and produced them myself (not meth tho'). I'm not proud about it as most people/friends I have with similar conditions have done MUCH greater things.

As many of you know, Mexico is partially RULED by cartels, you can look at Mencho's CJNG on YouTube in case you are not aware of. (Their power and influence is such that in some states they even have their own helicopters and paramilitary equipment and vehicles, they wander completely undisturbed by government). 
...


SO, if you've done that shit for a long time, most certainly you will relate to 3 or more of the following: 

-You are most likely convincing yourself in a smart and logical way that you have everything under control.

-You rejoice on being violent or having violent thoughts (overwhelming excitement)

-Complete lack of empathy, sociopathic behaviour becomes more noticeable.

-Your teeth get ugly as fuck. 

-You forget shit 

-Sometimes you feel chest pain or a ""weird"" back pain 

-You hate reading people like me and probably thinking I was just weak or not smart enough and could not handle it.

-You ""feel"" more keen and smarter than others.

-You lose interest on people and even yourself.

-You are aware that you are an addict, that you are killing yourself and just don't give a fuck.

-You look stupid and end up having to do meth with other lame-ass meth heads, which makes you feel as lame as them. 

-You become depressed or angry with ease.

-Complete lack of personality or authenticity, you are not thinking as you normally would (this applies to all but some don't notice and most won't accept).

-Regret from saying/doing stupid shit you normally would not do.

+You simply don't accept how great you are as a person or can't see it. 

The list goes on as this shit is basically ""fun"" poison (not even fun anymore, admit it, you just use it to avoid boredom) 


El ""crico"" or ice or meth that you smoke, if it's from Mexico, it's not quality meth, and is actually deadlier than REAL METH, long term users here MUST ADMIT that the meth they get now does not melt, crystalize and/or gets you high as before, If you get a hold with some supercooled pure acetone and use it to filter out this supposed meth you will notice different effects and crystallization patterns (honeycomb or football-like patterns, real footbal) some people even FALL SLEEP ON METH.


FACTS:
In order to produce meth in-masse some compounds/ingredients from meth have been 'replaced' to make it both profitable and ""to provide a better user experience"" which basically consists on making a drug more toxic and cheap. People usually underestimate how smart cartel leaders are and how  attentive they are with their market.
Meth now sells for as low as 1000 mexican pesos per OUNCE (28 grams) which is around 50 USD. Just imagine how bad that is.

PLEASE TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AND MY PEOPLE! If you live in the US, or ANYWHERE and really don't give a fuck about yourself just be aware that in my country people get beheaded, thrown in acid alive, burnt alive, raped, skinned like animals (alive also) because of that fucking drug. 

EVEN CHILDREN ARE VICTIMS OF IT! Either they get randomly killed and butchered to spread fear or they get recruited as child soldiers boosted on that same fucking poison, it is heartbreaking to see 10-14 years old wielding drugs and weapons. Nobody talks about this and usually people don't want to believe this is happening in a neighbour country. Even my people avoid this talk.

Don't believe me? Check out ""blog del narco"" on the internet, you can see people get killed on videos uploaded on a daily by cartels, and it is always the most graphic, disgusting possible ways. (Especially if its from CJNG). And yes, it is our fault no matter how far away from my country you are, no matter how good or bad or unrelated you may think you are.

TL:DR?
I know most people here won't really care about this and some will feel completely unrelated to the problem, that's what meth does. I'll be happy if at least one of you guys snaps out of this piece of shit drug. And just to make things clear, IT WON'T BE EASY, BUT GOOD THINGS NEVER COME THAT WAY. Be strong, you deserve better, you deserve love. There is always someone getting hurt because of you doing that shit, my people, someone who loves you and for the most part yourself.

God loves you all. 

If there is something I can do don't hesitate to DM.

Every time I abuse my meds and the comedown hits I think about how much happier I’d be without them and convince myself to tell on myself to my psychiatrist. But the next morning it’s like I never had the idea to stop and I continue to take them. I’m almost addicted to the feeling of when they kick in while I drink my coffee. 
Now that I’m working again, I’m too afraid to stop taking them and am almost hoping for another shut down. My job requires so much creative focus and customer service there’s no way I can work and detox at the same time. So I’m pretty freaked out I’ll be taken off them cold turkey 
I’m almost hoping he’ll be cool and taper me off but I don’t trust myself not to abuse them.
I also don’t want to lose the ability to get prescribed them again if I find myself unable to work. 
I originally got on them because not only am I ADHD but my Dr diagnosed me with chronic fatigue/ possible narcolepsy. I had a sleep study in the works but lost my insurance.
I tell myself if my county closes again I will detox but I doubt I’ll have the strength to get rid of my pills. I had the opportunity to get off them during the first quarantine but I stayed up all night making shit instead. I’ve been struggling for almost a year now and almost wonder if I preferred being an exhausted slug over a pill popping tweaker.
Has anyone admitted abuse to their prescriber?

At the age of 28 years old I hit a point in my life where I just wanted to end everything. Despite what other may see on the outside, I was just an empty body floating through the motions of every day life.

at the age of 28 years old I managed to become a full blown meth addict. I am truly in a dark place in my life. I started doing meth about two years ago, when I moved into a duplex. I moved right next door to a full blown tweaker. I mean this guy was fucking nuts blasting music 247, ten security cameras on his front door, and constant traffic going in and out. He was a cool dude, but at the time I seriously thought he was a whack job. I was going through a serious oxycodone addiction at the time and was always trying to one up the system to get my medication aka what controlled my life. I let oxy cotton get the best of me and I lost years of my life due to it, I lost relationships that will never be repaired. I lost myself. Sometime in 2017 I was finally getting off the opiates and that's when I was introduced to meth. It was just like Adderall right? So my neighbor being a huge meth head and me having an addictive personality it didn't take long for us to cross paths. I remember being off of opiates and being so bored that I would constantly YouTube what it was like to be on meth. After watching a few videos and hearing it was like cocaine x 100 I convinced myself to try it. Went to my neighbors and smoked it for the first time. It was the most disgusting taste I Had every ingested in my life. I remember the smell being so awful that my ex and I would make fun of the odor his house would produce. In the blink of an eye here I am two years later doing it from occasionally for work to a full blown everyday habit. I literally turned myself into a monster. At the time I was working independently and had become obsessed with growing my business. When I was addicted to Percocet's I used to get high and want to make money. When I had switched to meth that shortly changed within a few months of using.  I was living life fueled through a drug that was like cocaine x 100. I made myself crazy. I made myself parranoid. I went from 0-100. I had a beautiful girl, dog, condo, family, friends, assets and respect for myself. I was golden for success. Meth took all of that away and more. It took my ability to become happy. It took my ability to care for others completely away. If your debating using this awful subtance, please don't.",35

My issue with quitting is very minute compared to a lot I've seen here, but I was just hoping to a general idea of how long it will take for my brain to go back to normal after using a small (& prescribed by a doc) dose of 15mg adderall XR once a day for 9 months or so. I was never abusing it, and 15mg is a low dosage, so I'm hoping it won't take a long long time to get back to 'normal' me.

I've still had trouble quitting in the past, I would get very depressed/sad quickly after I tried to stop taking it for a day or two, so I'm always worried about quitting, but my depression has been much much better these past 3 months, so maybe it won't be so bad quitting this time.

I've had 6 relapses and one overdose, now I'm finally ready to get back on the quitting train. I want to break my last record and make it to a year clean and beyond. 

I started using again for two periods after extremely distressing events occurred. I used to escape the pain of loss because I don't know how to face those emotions. I craved meth because I lacked the feeling of connection that I desperately wanted, because being high with someone was the closest I got to intimacy. 

Through using psychedelics during this period I seem to have rewired my brain to crave it less over time. They have saved me from unbearable cravings. 

I have this lifelong complex of being unlovable that started in childhood. Being trans I didn't feel like anyone could want me the way I am, I worried that if I transitioned no one would ever love me. But if I didn't it wouldn't be real because that's not me. 

While sober I met someone who for for the first time in my life made me feel wanted, valued and cared for in a real way the first time meeting them. I've never felt that before, I've never had healthy, I've never felt loved. I can't believe that was what I've been missing all my life. 

Since then I used once more, deciding it would be the last time. Because after meeting them I don't feel an emptiness of connection that leads me to use. The last time for once felt like it was enough. I don't feel like I need it anymore and I barely want it. I should still be in the worst period of cravings up until two weeks but I barely have any. 

I don't want more, because I would rather have connection than have meth. Even if it doesn't work out with this person I know what genuine connection feels like and I know what to look for. I feel like I've finally found the root cause behind my use. 

I also want to share the story behind my overdose at some point but I've put it off because of vulnerability and I'm worried about the responses.",11

It started out fine I took it I wouldn’t have ever thought about abusing it. I wouldn’t take it on the weekends until I was tired and I had a paper than I had to take my meds , than I discovered I run much better on my meds so I took them and I was taking it everyday but it didn’t bother me I have lots of friends with adhd like myself who take them everyday. Than my effects started to wear off so I went from 15 to 20 and then the 20 started to wear off but my doctor refused to up my dose due to my rapid weight loss. Before I knew it I was doubling my dose somedays because I was hungover and had a huge paper due at midnight and than I realized that when I doubled my dose I ran faster AND got my school work done. Eventually I was tracking my days doubled so the doctor didn’t figure out I was doing that. I stopped doubling because you know I had to. Over Christmas break I decided to try to take a tolerance break and I had awful withdraws like puking , binging , and sleeping for hours. It was awful. Fast forward to now my 20s really aren’t cutting it for me anymore and I ran out of them this past week and so I started buying 30s from my friend and this whole week I took 30s just liking that I felt better and more productive and my workouts were great. One day my friend couldn’t get me a 30 until 1 pm and I was just itching for it and I was so mad he wasn’t home for me to get it. Once I got it my whole mood changed. I finally got my 20s filled today and I know that it’s not enough but I can’t double it. I can see this going downhill and I don’t know what to do I haven’t told anyone I wouldn’t even know what to say. Also have tried blow a few times and immediately loved it I don’t know if that’s related but it could be. I just never thought it would be me and I don’t really know what to do ://",40

At the beginning, the benefits surpassed the side effects. I felt that I had become a genius, and was smarter than everybody surrounding me. I was 5’6 and 110 pounds, and I believe that I was a God. Once freshman year of college came around, I literally did not sleep for a whole semester. I didn’t eat anything, and had a difficult time forming friendships. All of these side effects, but I still felt that I needed the Adderall to function. I have ruined every relationship in my life, and I believe my Adderall induced psychosis is growing worse. I’m currently 26 years old, and still haven’t finished my college degree, and am always searching for the next high. I have not matured in any way, and still act/behave as if I’m 16 years old. I really want to be independent from this medication, but I’m so scared that I’ll be a couch potato without it. Honestly though, how much worse can it get? I’m on the max dosage of stimulants, and can’t even focus to watch television. Other drugs have also entered in the equation to balance out the side effects of the Adderall. This COVID bs really sucks, because I want to go to a special inpatient rehab that specializes in Adderall/ADHD, but right now is probably not the right time. I’m blessed to have supportive parents that want the best for me. All my teachers new I would grow up to be a loser, I think it’s finally time to prove them wrong. I’ve always been dopamine deficient, because I never followed through with passions. However, I believe that Amphetamines are not a logical long-term solution. There’s those few responsible people, who can take a dose here and there, but I’m one of those people who intends to have one beer, and then goes on to binge drink, say the most ridiculous things, and then proceed to drive my car lol. It’s honestly not funny. I wish my life could’ve turned out different; I’m an old man now. If I was 20 I would say it’s whatever, but I don’t know, I’m losing hope guys.",16

2020-07-16 15:56:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/hsh2ll/wtf_is_the_point/,WTF is the point,"I was seeing a therapist for several months, including during the time I originally gave up adderall last year. I was abusing it and ended up with psychosis. The hospital diagnosed me as bipolar during that episode and my therapist and psych just agreed with it. I was not in the right mind at the time so I didn't oppose any treatment. However, in hindsight, that was a terrible diagnosis as I never exhibited those symptoms without abusing adderall. I really wish my therapist and psychiatrist considered that (and having known me for a years by then) before putting me on those medications.

When they started giving me the anti-psychotic meds, everything went downhill even more for me. At one point, I was sleeping 16 hours a day and barely functioning the rest of the time. Each time I spoke to my psych, I told him how shitty I feel. His recommendation was always to increase the dosage each time we spoke. My sessions with my therapist were pointless, I felt like shit all the time and we sat there in silence most of the time. I discontinued my therapy visits in May and was finally weaned off all medication since June. 

During this time I also gained 45 lbs and feel like a person I don't recognize. I hate everything, am argumentative, and want to just sleep all the time. I can't believe how much worse I let myself become since last year. I'm still having a hard time getting out of bed. I give the bare minimum effort at work and I'm fairly confident I will be laid off fairly soon. I have been trying to go for walks and do small chores each day, but I still feel like shit all the time. 

My friend recommended I try therapy again, so I signed up to talk to one next week. But I don't know why I bother. It seems therapists' advice is to be OK with feeling shitty. I guess I should just realize this is my new baseline for happiness and suck it up. This is just life now.",7

Takeaway: Even if Adderall is right for you and you never abuse it, it won't work forever and/or you can't take it forever. And when you do stop the pain of withdrawal is still something that will have to be gotten through.

**Long version:**

First off....thanks to everyone else who posts here. This site has been a tremendous help to me in my journey getting away from Adderall.

My background:  I first started taking Adderall in my late 40's after having taken my son (2nd or 3rd grade at that time) to get tested for ADD. During the meeting I noticed that every earmark he was showing in the way of ADD I recognized in myself to an even greater extent.  I always struggled in school (and other areas, I suppose) with paying attention and everything was hitting home. After a month or so I decided to go ahead and get tested myself, again, in my late 40's. I went through the testing honestly; no manipulation or acting...and, yeah, turns out I have it ADD too so I got my own prescription.

To this day, I really do think that I was at that time someone who needed and did well on Adderall.  I think my earliest dosage was 30mg XR (1/day) but before long I unilaterally cut it back to 20mg XR. I stayed steady at this dosage throughout my whole ""Adderall Career"" which lasted until about September of 2019. I loved the productivity and the energy. It really was wonderful. But in 12 or 13 years of usage I never once abused it.  I only ever took one pill a day. I never doubled up for a big project.  There were even a couple of times that I quit cold turkey simply because I resented having to take a pill to be smart and not because I really feared or felt like I was addicted.  From what I have read here a lot of people go through that.  But, in the end...and very I went back on because objectively (I think, anyway) I was more productive on it than not. I will say that back then I always suspected that Adderall was too good to be true and on more than on occasion asked my doctor about there being any long term downsides. He said he didn't know of any. It seemed counterintuitive but I took his word for it.

So, fast forward to 2019 and I am now 60.  Two things happened: 1) I began to suspect (and looking back at some things supports it) that while Adderall was still giving me energy I think its effect on my actual productivity was somewhat lessened. 2) When you are 60 you enter into a period of your life where other things enter into the equation. In my case it was blood pressure. It wasn't super high, but after going off of Adderall cold turkey in Sept 2019 for about 45 days my blood pressure dropped to acceptable levels.  I then went back to my doctor with the idea of continuing on Adderall XR but at 5mg/day.  Again, my idea, not his. He agreed. So I took that until about mid January 2020 but it didn't seem to be all that effective and my anxiety levels seemed abnormally high. (I am not a naturally anxious person).  In retrospect perhaps I was already going through withdrawal because of the lower dosage.

Then, in mid-January my wife of 30+ years went into the hospital overnight for what was thought to be a cardiac event. It turned out to be no big deal and she was released the next day....but not before I spent 24 straight hours wondering if I was about to lose my everything. So...add a possible PTSD causing event to the stack.

To review...I was already maybe in withdrawal by dropping to 5mgXR from 20mgXR. My anxiety was already high...then my wife's ""cardiac event""...the combination of which made me decide to quit taking Adderall altogether because its probable effect on my blood pressure in combination with my stress/anxiety levels I determined to be counter-productive to my long-term health. So I took my last pill back around January 10th or so.  I have been completely off of Adderall for 6 full months....although, going back to September I was only taking at most 5mgXR/day...and that's when I wasn't off of it for weeks at a time to see what it did to my blood pressure.  So, technically, I guess I weaned off.

And that is when the journey began that brought me here to this forum.

January/February/March were pretty miserable. I think my chief problem was anxiety...which drove sleepless nights...which, after a while drives towards depression/hopelessness.  To combat all this I have at various times been prescribed Buspirone, Clonazipam, a beta blocker of some sort. At one point I was taking 7 pills day. And I'm the guy that was trying to get off the one Adderall pill I was taking. (I'm the guy who never uses the whole bottle of pain killers after a dental procedure because how will I know if I'm getting better if I'm taking the pills?) Deciding I needed a specialist I started going to a Neuropsychiatrist. He took me off of all the other stuff and put me on 10mg of Doxepin at night to help me sleep. He thinks sleep deprivation is my biggest problem and is driving the anxiety. And....and....he is telling me don't go back on the Adderall. I think this guy gets it.  I have actually gone off Doxepin because I was suffering from brain fog a lot of days.

One pattern did emerge as I started feeling better (generally) about a 45-60 days ago: My worst times are between 4-5AM and Noon. After that I generally start feeling much better. I actually feel good through the evenings and up to bedtime.  And I can always, always, fall asleep with no problems.  I just can't get through the night. I'll usually wake up once, maybe twice, and be able to fall back asleep.  But then come that time you wake up and instead of returning to sleep the dread hits and life sucks until Noon. If you do return to sleep it is stupidly vivid, restless, crazy dreams. May as well just get up at that point. It's less disconcerting.

As of now I am not taking anything and am concentrating completely on sleep hygiene. I am getting better...but you know how it is. Everything comes in waves. 

The reason I am so glad I found this forum is because, for the first time in all of this, I have a true idea of how long it actually takes to get away from Adderall...even when one is (as I believe I was) a legit user. But just because it may have been proper for me to be taking it, it doesn't mean that it will keep working forever...or that you can continue to take it forever.  And I am discovering now that users have to go through the withdrawal process just like abusers have to, albeit it to a lesser extent.

Another issue for us old guys:  All of the weird physical ailments that one goes through during withdrawal...well, when you are 60 it might really be something starting to fall apart so you pay extra close attention to every damned tweak or quiver.

That said, there is one that is driving me the most crazy: Weak feeling in the legs.  I can still push the same amount of weights and I will typically put 20-30 miles/week on my bike...but my legs always seem to feel weak.  Anyone else get that?

Anyway, thanks for listening.",65

When I try to explain those symptoms to any physician or psychiatrist, they are sympathetic, but ultimately dismissive of anything they can't observe or measure. I'm sure there are doctors out there with histories of heavy drug use themselves, but I haven't met them, so whenever I speak to a medical professional, I feel like I'm speaking their second language.

What really did a number on me was Vyvanse and marijuana abuse, but before I get to that, I just want to unburden myself a little. I am one of those people who thinks out loud, so in some ways I am explaining myself to myself as I try to explain myself to you.

When I look at my life as if it were a case study, I do see a lot of data points that suggest susceptibility to substance abuse: difficult parents, severe depression from a young age, childhood molestation, lifelong insecurity and difficulty fitting in, growing up gay in a somewhat conservative area, alcoholism on both sides of the family, and just some general life shittiness--I'd call it ""unresolved trauma"" to make a doctor pretend to understand.

Nevertheless, when I realized, around age twenty-five, that I was addicted to alcohol, it took me by absolute surprise. Addiction was something that happened to other people: people who made bad decisions, people with rougher backgrounds than mine, people who in video games or anime would be tragic side characters or even villains--but it couldn't happen to me, protagonist.

But sure enough, while I was working a really stressful job while trying to apply to PhD programs, I found that I could push myself harder at night after work--read more, write more--if I had a few beers or some wine or, eventually, a few shots. I sent off my applications, thought at last I could pull back on the drinking--I had put on weight and didn't like the lack of control I felt--but found that I physically could not stop. Whenever I tried to sleep without at least a drink (but more often three or four and sometimes a full-blown binge) in me, I jerked awake shaking and felt like I was going to have a seizure.

Good news arrived--I got into a pretty good PhD program--and I moved 2,500 miles away from where I grew up to pursue the degree, confident that I could get the alcohol use under control on my own. I clawed my way through my first year, but by the end of it, I found myself in counseling, and eventually my counselor told me she didn't think I could ever manage moderate use: I would only grow more dependent, and so I should probably try out sobriety. She gave me Librium to do an easy, at-home detox.

The next parts are, to my mind, unfair, and perhaps because my zodiac chart is a cascade of water signs, I'm a complete martyr about it. I did fairly well getting off alcohol. There were slip-ups and additional detoxes, but my trajectory was clearly toward sobriety. At one point I realized that I saw alcohol in the grocery store the same way I saw pet food or feminine hygiene products--it just didn't apply to me. Unfortunately, life threw some additional nastiness my way: the SNRI I got prescribed after kicking alcohol was great at first but eventually seemed to blunt my emotions and lower my libido, and soon after I caught mono and was never the same afterward. I very likely developed what is called chronic fatigue syndrome, which isn't a positive diagnosis but rather a diagnosis of exclusion for a common pattern of symptoms following a major illness: severe loss of energy, some diminished cognitive ability, and some attendant depression. These are not good things to have to deal with in a graduate program.

My psychiatrist tried to help me. We tried Wellbutrin because I wanted off the SNRI but it made me feel crazy. We tried Modafinil to fight the fatigue but it hardly did anything. I had used Adderall recreationally before and I always enjoyed myself, but the next day I never felt the need to get more. That changed: I hungered for Adderall and noticed that I felt closer to my normal pre-mono self when I took it. My interest in things returned, sometimes I felt actual sexual desire.

When my usual psychiatrist--the one who knew I had a history of substance abuse--went on maternity leave, I made my move. I got the psychiatrist filling in for her to prescribe me Vyvanse, which I hoped would return me back to normal and allow me to finish the program I had driven myself into alcoholism to get accepted to. I knew it was allegedly more difficult to abuse than Adderall, so I wasn't simply aiming to get high--I genuinely wanted to get my life in shape. It sort of worked at first: I could concentrate for decent stretches of time and had more energy, but I became obsessed with my work at the expense of everything else, lost a lot of my interest in people, became easily irritated, and my comedowns were terrible. I very soon started abusing it--somewhat moderately, since I wanted my prescription to last most of the month--but more and more heavily over time. I developed a tolerance, and eventually got so far as having to have my roommate dispense the pills to me, or else I would blow through them.

I should have quit then. I would have been okay if I had quit then. I had all the evidence I needed to know I would never have a healthy relationship with Vyvanse and that it was hurting more than helping me. But, as with the alcohol, I was convinced that eventually I would get it all under control.

The death of my [very, very, very good cat](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybrosgonemild/comments/ee09pl/every_time_i_try_to_practice/) was the last straw. The stress of the program, the problems with my health, and the craziness of this year generally created a nice box of tinder. When my cat--who had seen me through quite a bit of shit--went from seeming a little sick to dragging his paralyzed back half around the apartment in the space of a weekend and I had to put him down, I lit the match. For the two or three weeks after his death, if I was awake, I was hopped up on Vyvanse and/or high on weed.

I've noticed that sometimes my sexual function returns when I smoke. It's like a part of my brain that the chronic fatigue and/or SNRIs shut down suddenly wakes back up. Coupling that with Vyvanse, I learned, helped even more. I was doing drugs and watching porn around the clock until one morning things got weird: my thoughts became very slow and fragmented, my vision or my perception of my vision seemed to be darkening, I felt disconnected from reality, my body felt numb and moving felt strange, as if I could only walk because I had memorized how--in short, I felt like my brain was shutting down. I stopped all the drugs immediately--it was a terrifying feeling--and after three days of my symptoms not improving, I went to the ER. They did a CAT scan and some other meaningless tests and said that I probably just did a number on my nervous system and that the symptoms should go away with time.

Not long after that trip, I had a week or even two of happiness and even modest productivity where my symptoms seemed nearly completely to disappear. Strangely, my sexual function seemed to return for a little bit--I was able to make love to my boyfriend three times in one night. My interests were interesting again. I was making sure to exercise and eat better. I was so optimistic!

In the throes of optimism, I suggested to my boyfriend that we go for a trip to Denver and back. We had a lot of fun--he had never seen the Rockies before--but for some reason my symptoms returned along with new ones, some of them worse than before: I had akathisia, depersonalization, difficulties with coordination, a sense of terror and hopeless, insomnia--it was terrible. It felt like I no longer really belonged in my body.

It's been two months since the incident--I suppose it was an overdose?--that eventually sent me to the ER, and every day now, typically halfway between when I wake up and go to sleep, I have a spell of feeling like my brain is shutting down. It's a difficult feeling to describe, but let it suffice to say that despite the fact it happens every day and that I'm ""okay"" at the end of each day, I never get used to it and I'm never fully confident that I won't die on the spot. There's a sensation in my brain as if the front part is just dead, a hunk of cheap gray steak attached to the panicking, working parts of my brain. I can't concentrate for shit--and I'm teaching a summer class. I rarely feel pleasure. I feel hopeless about my future. Sometimes--forgive me if this makes no sense--it feels like the part of my mind that says ""I"" and imagines things, the part I actively think with, has come loose. Even right now, as I type this, I feel like my brain's ability to hold the different parts of itself together has weakened and the part of me I think of as myself is just kind of wandering around in there. This is impossible to describe to a doctor without sounding dramatic or crazy. Every time I describe these symptoms I feel embarrassed, but they are nothing less than hell. I am policing my cognitive function around the clock because I have this strange feeling that my brain is just going to give up, that I'm just going to slump over in a coma or go to sleep and not wake back up.

My impression was that I was still at the shallow end of the drug abuse pool. Some of the stories I've read on this forum have been absolutely harrowing, and I'm in awe at what so many of you have endured. I know I had a pretty crazy binge with the Vyvanse--had been abusing it to varying degrees for about nine months and then rounded off that time by blowing through a fresh monthly refill in about a week--but all in all, on the scale of ways to mess yourself up with drugs, I really thought I was only at about a four out of ten. Yet here I am: not at all confident that this will ever go away.

I'm sure the PAWS patrol (bahaha, sorry) will jump in to say that this is probably PAWS, and that it will go away with time, though perhaps more time than I'd like to imagine. I've looked at information on PAWS from dopamine agonists, and I can in fact make those abstract symptoms lists fit this concrete hell if I squint hard enough, but the fact that I've seemingly gone backward instead of forward is scaring me. During my brain-shutdown spells I find myself entertaining the theory that the chronic fatigue was actually the onset of some neurodegenerative illness and that my drug abuse only accelerated the decay of my brain. Every night I stay up until I'm confident that I'll fall asleep right away, otherwise while I'm falling asleep I feel like letting my guard down will make my brain just give up. It feels like staying awake is the only thing keeping me alive.

Is any of this familiar to anyone? Is this just another flavor of PAWS? Can it get better and worse? Some kind of guidance--anything?",24

Downhill fast,"TL:DR- single mom, healthy vyvanse and weed medication shattered. Switched to adderall while unable to keep close contact with psychiatrist, quickly started abuse and all healthy changes not even yet solidified completely crumbled.

I have an appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow and have insurance so I can afford vyvanse and counseling again.

 Can I possibly get back to vyvanse responsibly, healthily, and safely? How can I truly make a strong routine that prioritizes rest, food, exercise, and deep connection with my child? Especially after screwing it up while being medicated? If I can't go back to vyvanse after adderall abuse, what can I do to help make it easier for my child and me to go through the week+ of irritability, depression, exhaustion, and general incapacitation associated with not just the withdrawal, but that being my no meds no weed baseline for existing? 

Background
29 single mom. Diagnosed at 14 but didn't get medicated until 27 because I felt it was time to get my life together. I had partied pretty good for a good while. Tried lots of drugs and drank too much but I never really had a substance that I had an addiction to. So I'm good to get on stims right? Since treating depression and anxiety alone weren't helping me much except to not have intrusive suicidal ideation thoughts.

So I got on vyvanse, 60mg in a bottle of water taken 2-3 times/day, and used weed, with my psychiatrist's knowledge. I moved from Oregon to Texas end of 2016, so the weed that helped me so much was illegal but my psychiatrist still knew and was in support off the record.

Well, I was trying to do right. Doing my best to create and enforce routine and structure and diet, exercise, and sleep. It was a huge transitional period. House sitting for a few months while working and saving and looking for a home to move into. Taking meds as prescribed. Attending counseling regularly.

Then my insurance got dropped. I got in some trouble, for the first time in my life ever, because I had weed in my system and now have to take a monthly drug screen. No more weed. I can't afford vyvanse. So I had to ask for a more affordable option. I changed meds and couldn't afford to see my psychiatrist, so I would communicate through his nurses...

Adderall has been shit from the very beginning but I felt like I was on such a great track of figuring out how to be a person, I didn't want to lose everything I had worked for! But I metabolize these meds so quickly, I have to dose IR like 6x a day just to make it through the dinner clean up bath bedtime necessities of parenthood. Before meds, we were eating package dinner and baths were inconsistent at best. Unmedicated energy to pay any attention to my child, let alone to actually play? Forget it. Vyvanse had no rollercoaster of crashes, irritability, headaches, etc. But adderall was just constantly trying to experiment to make my 30mg last all day while navigating the crashes and side effects completely on my own.

Needless to say, it didn't take long for me to start abusing adderall. Taking about 90mg most days. No days off, because I don't feel like I can afford to be basically out of commission for any days with a little one and nobody to help. Tolerance shot up because of frequently dosing through the day. What routine I had started to crumble. So sleep, diet, and exercise are horrible. I'm barely able to just maintain our house and basic needs. I do play with my child often, but I'm so disorganized that we don't really do anything except play pretend. No activities, crafts, educational activities, and it's unbearably hot so not much outside adventures either. No job. And I feel like I'm constantly telling my little one ""okay, just a minute. I need to bla bla lame unimportant housework, I'm almost done"". But I never feel done. When I do pause to sit and play, it's so hard to be really present and spontaneous and curious about my child because I'm thinking about all the things I have to get done, and how I wish I had some of my own ideas, or was looking at the thousands of pinterest ideas and could actually make a decision, for adventures or games or crafts or anything for us to do together.

Unmedicated:
I've never been able to really keep a job, very impulsive. Never had any resemblance of routine, even when living with my parents. Terrible sleep, I slept all the time... always tired. Nutrition? I had a good thing for about a year. Exercise? Never. Social life? I wanted friends but I never wanted to reach out to them so they all would always fade away. Always lazy, never really creative... When you're so tired all the time, and have such a disorganized mind how can you pick just one thing to muster up the little energy available to create? Self discipline to implement my own healthy routine? Laughable.",6

Well it’s been three days of continuous use since my relapse, actually today is day 4 of use. I am going camping this weekend, and all I keep telling myself is that it will be shit and I’ll be awful company if I don’t flush it right now. I keep thinking also, if I do flush it, I’ll be very grateful I did at the end of the weekend. But that worry of shit is going to hurt, I’m going to be depressed, and tired is what’s holding me back.

What do I do guys? I also am now in such inner trumoil because I’m back using. It never sits well with me, it’s not what I want to do, it’s not who I am. So now just the feeling of suffering of “I can’t believe I’m high again, how am I ever going to stop, I just want to be done with this shit.” Is happening. 

Idk. I actually dealt with heroin addiction and haven’t done that in six years, and that shit was psychologically easier to quit, the cravings were nothing like they are now. Yes the physical was way worse, but I was able to leave it behind. And even that, isn’t really reassuring becuase I feel this has been way harder to quit. And I’m not looking for AA- that shit doesn’t work- well at least for me. I’ve looked into rational recovery and that didn’t work that great. I just wish there was more ways to quit this shit that in my opinion are smarter and more brain braced or even more psychology based.",13

basically, i've been addicted to amphetamines (mostly dutch street speed, been told it's known as amphetamine sulfate outside of the the netherlands?) for a bit over 2 years. within months after i did it for the first time, i was using daily and heavily, pausing my use only to go to sleep - which tends to happen 1-3 times a week. even then, it's not even really sobriety as i just drink until i fall asleep, sleep for a few hours, and start using again.

next week, i'll be starting 10 weeks inpatient treatment. obviously, that means i can't use. but i'm starting to fear the idea of getting sober. on one hand, i fucking hate using speed, every second of using and being tweaked the fuck out. i hate it and there's nothing i want more than to stop living like this. but, the more i think about having to go through life sober, the more i'm considering to just not show up for treatment? to let my life go to absolute shit and die in the near future, because it seems better than dealing with myself, getting better, or being sober?

i'm well aware that 2 years isn't all that much - honestly, at 19, i haven't experienced anything in life in general and i know nothing - so this feels dramatic to say, but i genuinely cannot remember or imagine what life used to be like. i can't imagine how my brain worked, what i was like as a person. i can't remember things i thought, how i felt about things that i know have happened. i look at pictures from before i started using, and i can't imagine me being that person. 

i haven't had to deal with emotions, and i know i haven't processed any of the shit that happened in the past two years. i know that it's better to face it, and that i gotta put in effort to get better, and if i do i'll see that it was all worth it or whatever, but i just....don't want to? i barely have the energy to get through the day, let alone put in the work to get better? maybe i'm literally just lazy.

besides that, i'm terrified of seeing what doesn't get better if i get sober. i'm scared my personality will stay the same, and i'm just kinda eh to be around 'cause there's so little substance or positive traits to me. that i'm really just a shitty person, who does and thinks shitty things, whether i'm addicted or not.

i'm scared that i messed up things in my brain, and that they won't get better with time. or get better, but only very slightly. i know i was smart as hell a few years back. recently found back notes from presentations i did in high school, and i know i should be able to follow along, but nope, stringing together thoughts ain't happening no more. this has actually made it hard to speak - i fail to string together words/ideas, so any sentences i manage to get out just don't make sense? but all of that i can still blame on speed, and somehow that seems easier than being sober and having to accept that's just how it is.

if you're still reading at this point, thanks a lot for hearing me out. i guess i'm just incredibly conflicted and tired. i know that most of what goes on in my brain right now is a fucking mess, not rational, and probably not too reliable, but have no idea what part of it i can trust. any input that's not from my brain, any thoughts, experiences, advice, whatever, is appreciated.",10

I currently have 3 jobs, i picked up another one last week so I could keep myself busy and not use as much. How much money have you spent?",5

I finally made it into recovery. I’m 39 days clean and man my head is still fucking buzzing. The sleepless nights without dope get hard, man. All the changes and mental cravings. Just fucking pray for me guys. 5/28/20 I had seizures and went into cardiac arrest. I was smoking/slamming too much and not taking care of my health. I ignored all the warning signs, ignored all the health advice and gave everything I had away just to keep tweaking. I wish I could be one of the few who can hold it together. I’ve tried for the past 8 years and just couldn’t do it. I’m grateful I made the decision to get clean and I hope I don’t look back but I just wanted to say I finally feel okay. I’ll be around here awhile for support I suppose and I’ve been attending 12 step meetings again. Fuck I just wanna be clean and experience a normal life one day.

I went in with honest intentions. Sure, I didn't tell her about my abuse of 10-15 tablets a day (prescribed 6 a day), but I told her I want to get off the meds and not be reliant on them long term. I told her I ripped up my script up in early April. She was most happy to hear this, especially as we have bonded over our mutual love for mindfulness meditation and geared towards rewiring the brain.

I lied to her in the past about needing an increased dose in 2019. She seemed a tad suspicious of me when I tried arranging early appointments, only for her to tell me that she can't refill my script yet. So, as to not disappoint her, I wanted to show her that she has an ADHD case that doesn't need any medication anymore. I wanted to show her that she has genuinely helped me.

But then she asked how I've been coping at work and with distractability and WFH etc, and I genuinely realised it is evidently more difficult off Dexedrine. She suggested to decrease my dosage and repeats and just ""take them as needed"" - 100 5mg Dexedrine bottle with 2 repeats for 6 months (I used to be on 200 5mg Dexedrine bottle with 5 repeats for 6 months). I tried telling her how I also don't like not feeling functional off them, and then taking them as needed will be hard, but I agreed to it. Because another part of me felt excited I could still get the meds even after being honest with her. I feel I can now justify using again - this time only occasionally and without abuse. Can I get the honeymoon period back? Will the highs, the psychosis, the paranoia all be gone now because I'll only have 1 to 2 dexies a day? 

I feel like a kid! A new prescription is arriving! I've waited so long! Yay! And this time will be ""different"". It's a new beginning - a new relationship with Dexedrine. But I'm also now annoyed that I'm getting such a little script and my brain is trying to calculate how many I can have a day before I see her again. If I just have 1 a day, that will last 300. 2 a day will last 150. But the next appointment is 189 days away. So, I can have 1.26 a day.

But I want to keep going. I know it's hard, but I'm nearly Day 100 without Dexedrine. 

I have to rip up the script when it arrives in the mail, don't I?",25

At this point I need to decide if I'm going to return to the school program or withdraw.

I think it would be hard to successfully complete the school program while staying off Adderall (although I think doing the job itself, nursing, might be something I could do without Adderall. I really struggle with the heavy reading load of schoolwork though, where Adderall was so helpful).

Anyway, I'm thinking of switching my career direction to something ""safer"" in the sense that I can do it without needing to as heavily do tasks that I became so dependent on Adderall to do.

One alternative career path actually does also involve going to school again (to become a licensed therapist/counselor or LMFT), but so far I believe that I might be able to get through this therapy/counseling school program without Adderall more easily than nursing school. In researching a couple therapy school programs, it seems as thought the course styles are more lecture-based and interactive, and involve more essay writing and such, rather than the tons of textbook reading and memorization that nursing school entailed.

I'm curious if other people also made big life/career direction changes in tandem with recovering from adderall use.",4

well he caught me again this morning. he looked so disappointed. he has every right to be. he has every right to just kick me to the curb and tell me to fuck off. i’m so tired of this double life, the lying, the highs and the lows. i’m so miserable and i hate myself so fucking much. i think about offing myself everyday, it just seems a lot easier. i know my boyfriend catching me is what needed to happen, because i hate this feeling of disappointing him. i love him so much and i don’t know what to do. i don’t want him to leave me. he’s my best friend, my forever, my favorite man. 

i don’t know how to explain to him that i didn’t mean to hurt him, that just because i was doing all of this it doesn’t mean i don’t love him. how do i explain to him that i just don’t know how to stop? i don’t know how to live my life without getting high anymore. and then how do i tell him that i don’t really want to? i wish i wanted to stop. i want to want to stop. i want to finally hit my rock bottom-i’ve thought i have so many times & then i just keep falling. 

i haven’t prayed in a long time, but right now i find myself on my knees. begging for whatever the fuck is out to give me a sign that it’s out there, that there actually is someone watching over me and trying to steer me away from tina. 

i honestly wish i never met the dirty whore. she knows what i want and knows i’ll pay any price to spend just a night with her just so she can leave me with nothing. she  never loved me-it wasn’t a part of her plan. she just wants to steal and rip my heart out ruin my life, she wants my identity and everything i’ve ever loved. she’s the girl i didn’t know existed til i entered her cruel kingdom-now she’s the only woman i’ll ever truly know and the only woman i’ll ever love-even knowing that she’ll never love me. she loved watching me fall in love with her just this black hole of emotion waiting to suck you in, i could only see her beauty though. she fills the holes that live inside of me and she knows that, she thrives on it. she knows how badly i yearn for her on those nights where all i can do is cry and feel so fucking empty. she makes the moon feel like perfect company. she’s the only one whose never left my side. when no one helped me she did. she’s kept me alive more than she’s killed me. she’s given me hope in my darkest hour. she’s made me laugh when all I wanted to do was break down in tears. made me make friends when I didn’t want to get out of bed. through thick and thin she always know how to fix me, how to fill the voids inside my heart and in my soul that i left with every person i’ve ever loved, every person that took something from me that wasn’t theirs to take. she makes me forget about my pain. 

she knows that i’m not good at goodbyes. she knows anytime i say goodbye i don’t actually mean it. she waits for me, she waits for the moment my heart breaks or i just don’t care about life anymore. she makes my life worth living, but more often than not she makes me believe that i have never had anything to offer this world. that i have no place and i’ll never become anything. she puts those terrible thoughts in my head and tells me that all i’ll ever be in this life is a drug addict, nothing more. that i deserve every bad thing that’s happened to me in my life. she makes me fall on my knees and scream and cry for her not to leave me. she makes me so fucking empty and makes my loved ones hate me. i cant stand her, but i wish i could say i hated her but i cant. she’s so beautiful, i just wish i could understand why something so fucking evil makes me feel so good. 


all i want right now is to crawl in bed with my boyfriend, i want to feel his skin. i want him to hold me. i wish i had the courage to at least try and do that. i just don’t think he wants that right now-and i’m not sure if he ever will after this.",15

Right now my self-control is all but nonexistent. If I know there are any kind of ADHD meds somewhere in the room, I will keep looking and looking until the pills have been found so that I can then take them. It doesn’t even matter how I feel at that particular moment or in that particular instance or anything else like that. It is almost always certain that if prescription stimulant pills are within my reach in any way, I will find them and then take them as soon as I have the opportunity, regardless of the circumstances or consequences. This addictive behavior has followed me around for the past 8 years because, well, my addiction to ADHD medications started 8 years ago. I can’t stop myself when it comes to this kind of prescriptions. Whether it’s my Adderall XR or my fiancé’s Adderall IR or someone else’s Ritalin, it doesn’t make a difference, I just cannot stop myself. 

How do I even begin to get a handle on this situation? Where and when do I start rebuilding the level of self-control that I used to have over my actions? I want my self-control back more than anything else because I am convinced that it’s lack thereof is the biggest contributing factor to my massive prescription drug problem that keeps plaguing my life. I need to fix myself. I’ve tried doing it alone before and obviously that didn’t work well because here I am, asking for help. 

I truly believe that prescription stimulants are the devil in pill form and that I’ve been living in their own personal version of hell along with them for far too long. I want and need to fix this problem immediately. It’s gotten to the point where I simply cannot survive like this any longer. My ultimate goal is to be able to take my Adderall XR therapeutically and only as prescribed on a daily basis, but if that’s not something that can happen then I will have to say goodbye to it for good. 

Until now I’ve been so embarrassed about my situation that I’ve been pretending it doesn’t exist, but today I’m accepting it as reality despite how difficult it is. Any and all suggestions, ideas, pieces of advice, or bits of encouragement are greatly appreciated, and thank you in advance.",9

**A bit about me:** I am a sober alcoholic. I spent my first year of sobriety as a ""dry drunk"", attending DBT therapy for mental health but not working a program. At around 1 year, I went to AA because I still felt unhappy and unstable in my sobriety. Around 1.5 years, I committed fully to AA. I am now 2.5 years sober.

**A bit about him:** My boyfriend had a severe cocaine problem a couple of years ago. Diagnosed as a child with ADHD. Primarily used alone, he said it helped calm his thoughts and enabled him to relax. Around 2 years ago, he overdosed. Fortunately, he was able to call paramedics before his heart stopped. They revived him, he was in the hospital very briefly, and when they left, they offered him rehab or treatment. He said no, and that the experience was enough to keep him sober. He has depression, anxiety, and self-diagnosed PTSD. I don't know what caused the PTSD; he says he has never told anyone.

**Now:** Due to many circumstances, my boyfriend has been suffering from worsened depression and anxiety (family issues, COVID, and his physical health). He had gone from being a casual drinker to a daily drinker (6 pack a day). I had had a hunch for about 2 months that he was using, but I didn't have any firm evidence. I did not know him when he was using, I only knew him off drugs. He was loving, caring, empathetic. He was patient. He struggled with low moods sometimes, but he had a sense of humour about it. His own pain made him so compassionate with other people. I fell so in love with him. I couldn't imagine life without him.

Suddenly, his personality changed overnight. He was withdrawn, had an extremely short temper, was downright vicious when he was mad, disinterested in sex, no physical affection, taking way too many sleeping pills, had ""allergies"" a couple of times a week. He was taking daily ""drives"". I asked if he ever felt tempted to use again, and he was absolutely livid that I even dared to ask him (even though he'd asked me how my sobriety was doing a few times). 4 weeks ago, he punched a hole through the shower wall after his mom had made a playful joke at his expense. At this point, his mom asked me if he was using, and I said I didn't know. The following day, he was extremely apologetic to both of us. He said he needed to get therapy for his trauma and depression. I thought maybe this would be a rock bottom for him and he would get help. I still wasn't sure at the time if he was using, because I hadn't seen it for myself.

1 week ago, I discovered cocaine in our bathroom. It was unmistakable. I'm sober, but I've been to that party, I know what drugs look, smell, and taste like. I spoke to his mother, and she said she had felt it for 2 months as well, and had been researching rehab options and how to help him. I told her I had to leave and return to our apartment in the city (we'd been staying at her house about 4 hours out of the city). She said this was probably for the best. I told him I was leaving physically, but I am not leaving him. I told him I love him so much, and I am here for him. He told me that I am worthless, he used words I won't repeat here, I'm a liar, he hasn't used, I'm crazy, I'm making it up just to ruin his life, and that he hopes that I relapse and die. I didn't respond.

Last night, he emailed me with a vaguely threatening message saying it's in my best interest to pack up all of his belongings and ship it to him. I have NO intention of withholding his things. It will be expensive and difficult to pack and ship them to another city, but I will do it. I haven't responded yet though. I don't know how to respond. I don't know what to do. I know what addiction looks like, but I have never experienced this level of denial before. 

Is there anything else I can do or say? I know that you can't force someone into recovery if they are not ready. I know he is as safe as he can be at his parents' place. I know his mom will be there to help him if he is able to realize he needs it. 

I want to tell him that I love him so much. That I'm not afraid of his addiction, that I will stand by him, that I will be there for him. I want to tell him that he is so worthy of love and support. I am scared that if I say those things to him, he will just get angrier, or worse, feel triggered somehow and use more. I don't know what to do, and I would love any insight or advice. I myself am an addict, but my alcoholism was a different experience. I imagine I would have been angry and defensive too, but nobody ever called me out, so I was able to just quietly get help myself.

Once you form your own opinion still navigate and remain tolerant to other people opinions.

Personally I am meth-head. In clean recovering from last 10 month. Experienced psychosis horror as well as cloudy. It is the best time we all take care of each other and spread our word. Drug addiction is a worth experience to make you humble and understand the complexity of life. ",2
2020-07-01 08:03:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/hj8wb2/i_think_my_boyfriend_has_a_meth_problem_and_i_am/,I think my boyfriend has a meth problem and I am looking for some advice and insight.,"I’m using a throwaway because I’m embarrassed and probably will sound really stupid in this post, but I’m hoping some people can look past that and just offer some advice and maybe answer some questions I have. This is going to be long to get the basis of the story out, so if you read through I super appreciate it. I’ve tried talking to my friends but of course their reaction is basically “WHY ARE YOU DATING SOMEONE ON METH?!” And yeah well this is why:

We haven’t been together long, and we only recently reconnected after having had a month long fling back in November. I thought that something was “off” about him then, but he has really bad ADD and I kind of equated it to that. My anxiety makes me naturally a bit “quirky” so I have no judgement there. Maybe TMI and I apologize, but I also remember our sex the first time we met and as awesome as it was, he was never able to cum. He got super embarrassed at one point and told me it was because of his ADD medication, which lying on the bedside table, I understood and tried to make him feel better about it.

We ended up ending things because he said he had a lot going on and it seemed like we were moving fast and he wasn’t ready for that. I agreed as I was still questioning whether I wanted to be in a relationship myself so we ended on friendly terms. Over the next 6 months we talked here and there on Instagram, sending eachother memes back and forth. I want to note that I have done my fair share of drugs and I occasionally still dabble. So the idea of my partner doing drugs wasn’t something that bothered me, and we had talked briefly about this.

However, when we talked back then, he had taken a trip out of the country with his friends for a motorcycle rally. These things are notorious for partying and I expected as much. He told me he wanted to find some coke and I told him to be careful (again no issues because I do it too sometimes but being in another country I was a little worried for his safety). When he came back he joked with me about how he accidentally ended up purchasing meth because of the language barrier. I asked him how that was possible and what he did with it and he said he had done some, but kept the rest. I remember back then not really being sure what to think of that but he also wasn’t my boyfriend so it’s not like I could really get too upset about it, we were just a fling. 

Flash forward a month ago, we are on Instagram flirting back and forth and I mention that I am watching my moms house (which is close to him) all week while she is out of town and I’ve been wanting to party. I tell him I have some coke and even though he doesn’t drink, I would be and he could come hang out if he wanted. He mentioned also having “party favors” since it was the week of his birthday and I assumed this meant more coke, so we end up linking up and he comes over. We do the coke I have and go swimming and at one point I mention that I’m now out and maybe we could do some of his. He starts making lines and when I go to do some he stops me and says “you should know that isn’t coke.” I was confused and said “what do you mean?” And he tossed me a bag with a rock in it and said “well it’s this.”

I was drunk, and having done cocaine for the last 8 years on and off of my life, I figured I had probably dabbled in some mixed with meth before and didn’t see the big deal in it. So I did some with him. And that turned into us doing it all night. We never slept, and the next day I felt like complete garbage. We also did all of it and there was none left. I was pretty ashamed of myself but this is also typical me behavior when I’m partying I don’t really stop to think of the consequences. 

We end up spending the next few days together since my mom is out of town and really start to like eachother. We open up about how over the past six months apart, we have both been thinking a lot about eachother and discover that the strong feelings I thought I only had developing were being reciprocated (I had really really REALLY liked him back in November and was super bummed when we stopped talking, even though I thought it was best at the time). He tells me that he sees this as maybe a second chance and that he’s in a better place now, and in talking about the future he mentions that this week was what he wanted to be his last “party week” and he didn’t want to do that stuff anymore. I asked him if he did it often and he said he only did it occasionally when he wanted to party. He doesn’t drink and hasn’t for over a year. But I figured this was something he did recreationally when he was at the biker rallies he goes to and what not. I understand because I party too sometimes with my friends and will do coke for a few nights or molly or whatever happens. But the fact that he expressed wanting to quit and leave this life behind I felt a little better about because I mean, I’ve always considered meth to be pretty serious and after the night of doing it consistently, I knew I never wanted to do it again. 

Our next week consists of normal stuff like watching movies and cooking and nothing crazy like the first night. A few nights go by and one morning we wake up and he asks me what I want to do that day. We had spent the previous two days in bed basically having sex and watching tv that I think even though we were both enjoying eachothers company, we also felt like lazy pieces of shit. I start coming up with ideas, there’s not much to do because of the pandemic but nothing is really sticking. I’m pretty set on the idea of going for a hike somewhere and getting outside but he doesn’t seem to like the idea. Anyway, at one point he mentions that we could “party” again like the other night. At first, I’m like “yeah I could see if my friend has any blow but who knows how long it will take to get them to get it to me.” But I’m also still feeling the effects of the other night and not really into it. 

He then expresses that he isn’t really into the idea of doing coke because of all the fentanyl laced stuff going around. I agree somewhat but also explain to him that he watched me do it all day the other day and I’m fine. He then says he wants to “party” one last time for his birthday week and I realize what he means. He wants to get more meth because we did it all. I’m immediately uneasy with this idea and I KNOW that I don’t want to do it again because 1. I hate staying up all night. Even on cocaine I will eventually stop so I can go to sleep. On meth it was impossible to do that. 2. I felt like such trash the day after (which was also in part of the drinking I did I’m sure) but I just didn’t want to do it again and I had already made that decision the day of my hangover.  He then says “we don’t have to if you don’t want to, it’s just an idea.” I nicely tell him that I wouldn’t like to do that again and that he said he wanted to quit anyways so let’s just do something else.

Well an hour or so goes by and he kind of just outright says “it’s my birthday week and I want to do it again so I’m going to get some. You don’t have to do it if you don’t want to.” I was kind of in shock I didn’t know what to say, and yeah I guess this is where I’m an idiot, but I was basically like “fine do what you want.” So he leaves and goes searching for the guy because apparently he doesn’t have a phone he has to just drive around and find him. He comes back after an hour and a half and says he got some and starts doing lines. I don’t partake and am actually working on homework for the summer courses I’m taking and kind of leave him to do what he wants for the evening. 

He ends up doing it for most of the evening. It’s like laid on the bed side table and in between us having sex he pauses to do more and every time I feel a little more uneasy inside. Over the next 2 days he finishes the “new supply” he has. My mom is stuck out of state due to weather complications so we are going on a week and a half at this point of hanging out. I just keep telling myself that once he finishes this bag, that he won’t want to do it anymore and we’ll be good. When he does end up finishing this bag, I asked him if he was “ready to start his new life” so he had put it before, and he seemed pretty bleak about it and said “I guess.” The next two days that he is off it, he gets super irritable with me and even snaps at one point when we are trying to get my car to start that has died.

I thought it was an over the top reaction, but since he was also trying to quit smoking, I figured this was where it came from. I mean we had spent several days together when he finished the first bag and was without it and he was fine. So flash forward my mom comes home and I go back to my house and he to his. We both agree some time apart isn’t a bad idea as it’s not healthy to spend everyday with someone. But then he starts to become distant and is talking to me less. I go two whole days without him responding to me and one of these days we had plans to have dinner at my moms house (he had wanted to meet her and even though I thought it was soon I was happy that he wanted to). So I was pretty bummed he was acting so cold all of a sudden.

Eventually I get a hold of him and he tells me that he’s starting to get scared because he realizes he has serious feelings for me and doesn’t know what to do because his last relationship was terrible and he doesn’t want to hurt me etc. I convince him to meet up with me so we can talk in person even though its nearing midnight. We end up talking most the night and I seem to calm him down. At one point in our conversation I mention having taken an oxy earlier in the night that I had laying around because I was feeling sad (I probably do pills a couple days every few months if I somehow stumble upon them.) I was feeling sick to my stomach because I don’t do opiates a lot and he says “do you want something to wake you up?”
I ask him if he bought more of that stuff and he nods his head yes. I ask him why, I thought he wasn’t doing that anymore and he had said the party week was well over etc. He tells me he’s just having a bad week and that he needs it to function with his ADD sometimes.

At this point I don’t know what to say. I’m mad, but I’m also on drugs as we are having this conversation. But I also don’t them as often as he does and it is seeming like this “once in awhile” thing is more of a habit than he lead out to be. I start to think about the few texts I’d received from him the last few days and them mentioning how he was going “non stop” and had “too much to do”. I kind of put two and two together and realize that he was most likely on this stuff when he was ignoring me. At this point it’s 3am and he has to get up in 3 hours to meet his friends at the river to go tubing. He had invited me but I thought it best I didn’t go. He is falling asleep but I tell him that I don’t know if I can date someone who does this stuff as often as it seems he is. He is half asleep at this point but tells me he doesn’t do it all the time. I ask him if he thinks he has a problem and he kind of laughs and says “no I don’t think I have a problem. I just like to party sometimes.”

We end up falling asleep for a couple hours and when we wake up in the morning he gets up to start getting ready for his day trip. He tells me to just sleep in and I don’t have to rush out so I try to fall back asleep but I can’t. At one point I sit up to check my phone and he comes over to kiss me. When I look in his eyes I can see that he’s on it, and then continue to watch him while he gets ready. He’s buzzing all over the place and I just know that he’s on it. I go to the bathroom and notice a 5 dollar bill next to a shaving cream can and figure he must have crushed it up and snorted in the bathroom when I was trying to sleep.

At this point I’m feeling super sad and I decide to go home. He kisses me goodbye, oblivious to any of my emotions because he’s high out of his mind and I have tears in my eyes because it’s hard to see someone you care about like that. 
That was 4 nights ago and I haven’t seen him since.
He ended up ghosting me all day the next day again and part into the day after when he finally responded to me and sent me a message saying he thought he needed some space to figure some things out about himself before diving into this relationship full force. I take this time to mention again, I don’t know if I can be with someone who is doing the drug as much as it seems like he is and I would like to talk about it more. He doesn’t acknowledge that text and I end up leaving him alone so he can have some space and tell him when he would like to reach out I am here to talk.

He ends up texting me today and we talk a little. I mention that I am going to on his side of town again this week watching over my moms house because she is going camping for the weekend. I make sure to mention that in a way that isn’t like I want to party again but like I would like to meet up to talk since we will be down the street from eachother. He says that he thinks he can do that and he will keep me updated. So as of now, my mom leaves Thursday and I’m hoping to see him Thursday or Friday before she comes back.

I know this was all really long but I feel like it’s necessary to explain where I am coming from and how this all happened. I’ve been using this past week to reflect on a lot of things. Thinking a lot about the first time we “dated” and how maybe his odd behavior was because he was high then? I remember one incidence where he was just rummaging around non stop in his kitchen and wouldn’t take a second to even talk to me. He seemed all over the place and I thought maybe he was off his meds or something. Flash forward to now and that look in his eyes is similar to the one I saw the other day when he kissed me goodbye. 

I feel really stupid. Like I just thought someone could use meth on and off like that? I mean can you do that? I also dont think I expected to see him again after that initial night, but now that feelings have developed it’s obviously an issue. He’s told me he is falling in love with me and I believe those feelings are real, by how he’s been around me, but he’s also said he has things about he himself that he thinks will ruin this and I think maybe that’s what he’s talking about but we haven’t been able to have a real discussion about it. He mentioned the other night when we were in bed talking that it is something he is embarrassed of and that he doesn’t want his friends to know he does. So this makes me wonder if it’s why he kept it so secretive also. In reference to his ex girlfriend he often says “she had to put up with a lot.”
And this makes my mind go there as well.

I obviously know I need to talk to him about it. I haven’t had a chance to because he went so distant he won’t talk to me on the phone even. That’s why I’m hoping to see him in person this week and finally get down to it. I’m obviously not talking to everyone about this but I have brought it up with a few close friends. My one friend is telling me there’s no way he can just “do it here and there” and that meth “doesn’t work that way.” He’s said that he would not be able to just quit it and that rehab is the only way. I don’t know why I thought it was like something you could kick on your own. I guess I’m just super confused and I feel really stupid that I’m even in this situation.

The other weird thing to me is that he doesn’t stay up for days on end. He sleeps early and gets up early. He has a pretty normal schedule. How is someone who’s on meth all the time able to sleep? I’ve also read about how people with ADD experience meth differently. I think that he thinks it obviously helps him function and that’s why he uses it, I don’t believe he gets that euphoric high feeling most talk about. I’m not trying to downplay this by any means, just from how I think he’s thinking of his usage.

I guess my question is, is it possible to just stop? He expressed he wants to, says he doesn’t use it all the time (but now I’m questioning that) and that he’s always done it like this. (Just uses it occasionally to party and then goes periods of time without it). Am I that stupid that I would even believe that? When all is said and done, I don’t think he is a bad person. I do think he is ashamed of his using and I do think he really has feelings for me but also is struggling to date me in spite of this because he’s now found out I am not okay with it. 

What do I do? Has anyone else been in a situation like mine? 

I really appreciate anyone who read all of that. I needed to get this out of me. Please be kind, I know it’s easy to call me an idiot. I’ve been doing that enough myself lately. I just really care for this person and want to help them, even if it is just as my friend and not my boyfriend. He doesn’t have much and I don’t think he’s a monster. He just has some demons like the rest of us.",4
