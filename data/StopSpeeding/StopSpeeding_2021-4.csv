I've been taking Adderall for ~7 months, and I desperately want to get off of it. I take 30 mg IR. Adderall has made me super irritable and extremely depressed. The way I treat the people I love when I'm on it, especially coming down, makes me feel terrible. I'm not an angry person and sometimes I have a hard time believing the person I am when I'm on Adderall is not the person I really am. It's fucked with me so much that I would rather stay away.

 I've been scared to quit but I went cold turkey today. I feel great. I finally had a steady normal mood and it was so nice after so much emotional stress. I kind of just felt groggy, like I wasn't entirely awake for the entire day. I felt really good for most of the day but feel exhausted now. Is my mood going to be greatly affected by this? I've only been taking it for 6 months, but my comedowns consisted of a lot of crying and irritability, both of which are not normal for me. If Adderall affected my emotional state this bad, should I wean myself off? I can keep going like this -- unless it will inevitably get worse?

I can't seem to piece more than a month and a half clean and haven't since last summer when I had six months clean. And even when I had 6 months clean things weren't better...

So here's the thing...either I really am being stalked and harassed..and set up by almost every individual I have partied with and come into contact with in the drug world. Or I have definitely developed schizophrenia or a schizo-effective disorder and am extremely paranoid. My accounts are always being hacked. I feel like I am always being followed and set up into situations where people can manipulate my situation into something where I can be incriminated into something later on down the road. All of the people too.... all though and up oddly being connected when being analyzed....so I definitely think it could be real. But at the same time I think it could be being paranoid. I guess i am posting this because i want to get people's experiences on how real things feel in the moment. Like I walk down the street and (being sober for months) feel like people are organizing situations and know things about me. 

I've been using for almost 4 years. With 10 months of sobriety and 6 months of sobriety and random spurts in between.... I use IV once in a while now but for the first 9 months of using I injected almost a gram a day. I've experienced several events of psychosis but now I feel my life is just one psychosis where i feel people are trying to set me up and or the police frame me etc... it's horrible.... it causes me to have no hope... but at the same time I honestly think it's happening too because I have some individuals who do not like me and have some hatred towards me and we all know meth heads can be psychos and fixate and dedicate themselves towards one thing and if that one thing is hatred... and there's money involved (drug dealers) then I'm fucked. 

Because I have evidence that shit has actually happened to me and my personal shit. Like not everything I think is paranoia and delusion. It's scary. Idk what to do. I've gone to the police so many times. But because I don't have an actual singular crime with one individual to present to them they don't do anything or offer any help. And I live in a small state where everyone knows everyone especially in the party scene.

First time i relapsed I got 3 pills instead of my usual 6-7. I was going 2 weeks strong so after that day I felt so guilty. The reason why i relapsed was because i had nothing to do. 

Second time I relapsed was after a week of being sober and the reason why was because I felt so lonely. Like no one was there for me or felt like there wasn’t anyone that I could reach out to. (There definitely was people but my mind played tricks on me). Picked up 4 pills. 

Third time i relapsed was a week and a half after that. The reason why was because I have a side job that requires me to work on my own time... and make stuff.. yeah you can see how that happened. 

Positives: 
- i started going to the gym! And the days when i went, i didn’t feel the need to pickup. 
-i’ve went down from taking 360 mg of “Adderall” every week to 90mg or none when i (when i did relapse) 

-i’m not going to beat myself over it. Even staying a couple days sober was such an achievement to me because I once convinced myself that my worth was because of a drug. (Ngl i have those thoughts sometimes but I understand its a process. Big thanks to those who post their progress!)


- i just feel like It’s useless to beat myself down anymore to such an extent. It’s a disease. I hate it. But i guess the only thing I can do is to not dwell on it and to actually try and be better. To be more forgiving. To not speak of myself negatively and to treat myself as if I was a friend in the same position. When i was using nearly daily, I was close to ending it all because I couldn’t find my worth outside of the drugs. 


Overall, what i’m trying to say is to be more forgiving and to be more empathetic for your own self. Don’t excuse the behavior but analyze it and figure out how to tackle it. Like a lot of people say on here, you have to want to quit.",15,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.44403765}"

I've hid my abuse from my psychiatrist and convinced her to get me ADHD tested so I can get my pills that way. The testing hasn't happened yet but it will in the next month or so. I might actually get diagnosed with ADHD and get stimulants prescribed. It scares me to have easy access to them so I might cancel the testing.

I would take Vyvanse in the morning and go back to sleep so I can get out of bed at a reasonable time.  I took it on the days I felt tired and shitty. I have a shit sleep schedule so I used it to stay awake at normal hours while I'm sleep deprived. I was taking it almost every week day so I can ""focus on studying"" but to be honest I wasn't focusing at all. I just watched YouTube/Netflix or do other dumb stuff while submitting school work before right before the deadlines. I also used it as a crutch for social anxiety.

I've had some time to think, and I'm taking more seriously now something a few people commented on [my (also pessimistic) post before that](https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/m93ivx/is_recovery_a_lie/): I need to work toward my recovery instead of expecting it to happen spontaneously on its own.

My complaint has been that my symptoms just don't seem to be moving in the right direction. I have been particularly defeatist because a) I fear my pre-existing condition may be responsible for my symptoms, b) I fear I may have done irreversible damage with my Vyvanse abuse and overdose, or c) I might just have really aggressive PAWS.

In any case, I feel like shit. Lately, however, I have enough energy to feel sick of feeling like shit. I'm wondering of the aggressive downturn my mood took is actually the result of some healing. Whereas before I was so sapped of energy that I couldn't feel anything and only looked forward to going to bed, now I have enough energy to realize how miserable I've been and how much my life has fallen apart. Going forward might feel like going backward.

Anyway, I've knocked together a provisional list of changes I've been trying to make over the past few days and hope to continue into the future:

a) a half-hour of aerobic exercise at least every other day

b) multivitamin and fish oil every day

c) no porn, less junk food, less video games

d) more anti-inflammatory and neuro-protective foods

e) begin looking for a recovery group to join, or at least post here more often

I'm one of these people who needs to be held accountable. This version of myself cannot be trusted to make any lasting changes without supervision.

I’m back seeking more advice. I constantly read posts from others but sometimes it’s best to reach out when help is needed. Thank you to everyone who posts though, regardless of where you’re at in your path, there’s always someone hoping to follow in your footsteps.

I’m at almost 6 months sober from Adderall abuse, upwards of 100+mg daily for 5-6 years. I’ve been struggling with the anhedonia, apathy and non existent libido. I’ve also learned I have some sort of problem getting my words out now whereas before my abuse I did not. Not sure how long I’ve had this problem because I was probably too fucked up to notice until now. 

Today, I took one 20mg Adderall. That’s all I thankfully had, as I just wanted to ‘feel’ something. I did and part of me regrets taking it but the other is sadly relieved to feel something, even if it was a facade. I know if I had more, I’d be high as a kite, but that’s why I only took one from a friend. Now that I’m coming down, I know that ‘feeling’ is still the same old lie. 

How do you keep marching forward clinging to a hope that you’ll one day feel normal again? How do you keep on hoping you’ll get the frisky feeling of wanting to jump your significant other’s bones? How long can you hope for until you sell yourself to the devil again?

My background - 28F prescribed 2 XR 25mg a day for the last 8 years. About the last 4 years I burnt through a script fast as fuck. I’d buy full scripts off buddies or vyvanse. I was at one point taking upward of 150mg a day. My favorite was the 30mg IR boost somewhere in the mix. I slowly realized there’s no responsibly taking it for me anymore. How many times do I need to keep lying to myself? When is it enough? So...when I tan out I ran out. I blocked all my plugs. And I was fucking terrified. Today is day 17 and this week I’ve felt fucking fantastic. I used OPMS Kratom to brace myself for the first 5 days, then stopped that too. I also firmly believe using IR’s only in the very end helped too because I didn’t have adderall constantly pumping though me. I also have a nightly vitamin regiment that I think played a significant role - CoQ10, pre and probiotics, B12, Vitamin D, Magnesium, 5-HTP, and melatonin. I also started doing yoga, and ensured before I stopped my house was clean and I was in a really positive and peaceful environment with my dogs only and my kiddos. 

This is my personal experience. I do believe environment and mind set can play a role. I feel great and didn’t expect such a fast turn around and I’m grateful for it and will never go back. Others experiences are just as valid, please do not think I’m discrediting anyone, but simply encouraging anyone whose seeking to get clean.",23,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.6673378}"

I’ve made posts in the past voicing my concerns about being hooked on it, and while this is the first one I’ve made in a while, I just wanted to write this because I wanted to share what I feel like makes it so hard for me to stop taking it.

Adderall just does everything for me. And when I say “everything”, I mean literally everything, and as a result, I’ve completely thrown my life away to it. It gives me all the dopamine and pleasure I need, so I rarely ever step out of the house to seek any out. It makes me super confident and talkative, so when I do make plans and hang out with people, I’m super chatty and can carry conversations easily. When the workload for school gets heavy, it gives me the energy I need to get it all done. And those are just a few examples.

I feel like I’ve been brainwashed to the point where, if I stop taking it, I genuinely believe the only way to feel any sense of pleasure, to be able to socialize, to get my work done, etc., is by popping another pill. When in reality, all of that can be done by myself without a pill to do it all for me; it’s just a matter of taking the initiative to seek out said pleasure, learn communication skills and gain self-discipline naturally. Because if Adderall is doing it all for me, I’m not actually learning anything. I’m not actually gathering the tools necessary to improve and grow as a person. Instead, I’m just popping pills, kicking back and relaxing while I watch myself (what appears to be) prevailing, but is actually getting absolutely nowhere. Kind of ironic for a drug that motivates you, if you ask me. But that’s just the irony of it: Adderall doesn’t make you motivated; it just motivates you.

In other words, externally, I’m making progress. But internally, I’m making none whatsoever. I just wanted to propose that, perhaps, this may be something important to realize when it comes to quitting a drug like this. While I know that cravings for this drug exist and withdrawal symptoms can be brutal, from a psychological standpoint, once you realize after you quit that it’s all up to you, and that even though you might not feel as good, you are gaining the skills, knowledge and experience you need to become a stronger, better person without a pill just doing everything for you, then just maybe quitting might become easier. You gotta do it for yourself.

This whole time I just thought I was addicted to the high, and while that may be true, I realized that I was more addicted to everything it was doing for me, and that living happily without it is still a possibility. You’re just not going to have the extra help you’ve been receiving for so long that you now think you absolutely need.",67,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46572286}"
2021-04-24 07:30:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/mxi4qa/talkin_bout_suicidal_ideation/,Talkin' 'bout Suicidal Ideation,"My calendar for the next month is riddled with appointments: therapist, psychiatrist, neurologist, whoever will see me. I am making what feels like a final effort to recover.

More and more I recognize myself going through a series of behaviors common to suicides in their final months: withdrawing from friends, preparing a final statement, tidying up the apartment so as not to leave behind a mess. I even have a sum of money to leave my boyfriend, though he is taking delicate steps to become my ex-boyfriend. These aren’t the actions of a hormone-addled teenager who in a fit of passion knicks his flesh with a razorblade before changing his mind. These are the level-headed arrangements of someone who sees no other option.

I do not want to die, but I cannot live the way I’ve been. My case is complicated because before my Vyvanse overdose, I had a lingering post-viral syndrome that gave me chronic fatigue, brain fog, treatment-resistant depression, and killed my sex drive. I have the distinct impression that the virus disconnected or damaged the most human parts of my brain. Life has had a different texture since the virus: it feels colorless, or as if I experience it through a veil. The strange thing is that—especially early on—if I smoked marijuana or took Adderall, it felt as if my brain reconnected itself. The veil lifted; my head cleared; suddenly other bodies *meant* something to me again. It strikes me as an unambiguous signal that the virus did something serious to my brain.

But you can imagine how skeptical doctors are of such an account. The vast majority of them don’t know what it’s like not to feel normal, and so they don’t even know how magical normal feels: to be interested in things, to see other people as people, to feel as if you are actually in your own body. When I describe my symptoms, they run irrelevant tests and stamp me with the lazy catch-all label “depression.” I’ve dealt with depression most of my life; this is different.

Eventually I got the Vyvanse prescription to combat the fatigue and brain fog. It granted me about six hours of normalcy a day—more if I abused it. The abuse started early, grew in severity as my tolerance increased, and eventually I overdosed. No doctor has offered an explanation of what happened during my overdose: my vision darkened, my thoughts become slow and disconnected (imagine fireflies in a field at night), and I spent about two days unable to do anything.

I recovered to a slight extent quickly, and actually felt quite good—though still impaired—the month after the overdose, but now, eleven months later, my symptoms are terrible: my brain feels swollen; I’m overwhelmed by the least tasks; my emotions are entirely flat; and anti-depressants have a very strange effect, as if I’m about to lose control of my own mind. Many days I cannot get out of bed. The anhedonia is the worst part. Nothing brings me joy, but my brain craves it. I eat too much; I play video games too long; I look at porn that means nothing to me. If I had to hold a normal job (I’m a graduate student), I would not be able to support myself. It’s impossible, at the moment, to imagine that I have a future because my symptoms show no sign of improving.

I tried to do the responsible thing by letting my therapist know how far toward suicide I fear I’ve traveled. One of the things she suggested was that I let my boyfriend—whom I had plans to move to Colorado with in August—know how I was feeling. So we had a long talk where I told him everything and expressed my fears that I was a burden to him: that he wouldn’t want to live with someone who could barely support himself, who can’t make love to him, who spends entire days in bed, et cetera. The result: we are now going through a slow-motion breakup. I am losing one of the last things I had.

Before we move out and go our separate ways at the end of summer, we’re still in a relationship of sorts, but we’re now “open,” so he can finally spend time with men who can actually have sex. We had this talk a few days ago, and I told him I was okay with the arrangement, or at least more okay with it than the alternative of feeling that I’m holding him back, but I was caught off-guard when he told me today that he already has a meeting arranged.

On Sunday he is going to meet up with another man while I sit home and try to distract myself. My imagination weakened after the overdose, but I suspect it will rise to the occasion. No distraction will prevent me from imagining some other healthy guy doing to him what I want to do to him. I do not blame him; he is young and healthy and attractive. I want him to be happy. After a year of caring for me, how can he not take the opportunity to be with someone normal?

So: I’m making a last effort to get better. I’m seeing professionals. I’m forcing my zombified body to exercise. I’m eating fish and taking vitamins. But I just don’t see signs of recovery, and the tortures and indignations are really piling on.",13,"{'viral': 1, 'virus': 3}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6534185}"

I was myself. I’m a medical researcher (not an MD) who struggled with Adderall abuse. If you’re losing hope and want the real medical understanding of brain recovery after stimulant abuse, here it is.

First, do things that we know promote faster brain cell growth, such as aerobic exercise, stress-reducing activities (e.g. sex, meditation), and neurobics (brain exercises):

TL;DR: 
The brain will heal, but slowly. It will take years, and it may never be 100% what is was.

With that said, you could be back to normal in many areas within a few years depending on duration of abuse and amount used.

I think ALL drugs should be legalized and controlled the way alcohol and tobacco are. 

At first this seems counter-intuitive as it appears to endorse the use of drugs like meth and crack. In fact, the opposite is true and here’s why.

Cigarettes are legal and a majority of men and women in the 1940’s smoked. Today that percentage is a tiny fraction of the once popular vice. What happened? They stigmatized, educated and invested into stop smoking aids. Where I live in Vancouver, smoking is about as cool as shitting your pants, but they are still legal. 

In the 30’s during alcohol prohibition, the world got its first look at organized crime, not a reduction in alcohol use. All prohibition accomplished was put large sums of money into violent criminals pockets. 

This is exactly what banning drugs like cocain/meth and heroin accomplishes. The demand for a substance is the same whether legal or illegal. The issue with illegality is that if I’m a drug dealer and I get robbed, my only recourse is violent retaliation. What are they gonna calls the cops to report a theft of their 2oz of crack? No they are gonna shoot the person that stole from them, or they will continually get robbed. Criminals only recourse for almost everything is violence. The Mexican cartels are responsible for unbelievable violence and the casualties are comparable to a war zone in some areas.

If we were to legalize, 90+ % of organized crimes income is instantly gone. They will find other means I’m sure, but there is no question it would cause a massive reduction in crime across the board. With legalization would come reallocation of resources wasted fighting the war on drugs. Invest into education, treatment and research to help those who still are trapped in their addictions. I can’t even imagine if I knew what meth was, and all the damage it would cause me before I tried it at 20 years old. Maybe I wouldn’t have used it. I was naive and didn’t know what this stuff was. There was no education about drugs and addiction when I grew up, just a bunch of BS eggs cracked onto a skillet saying,” this is your brain on drugs” “just say no”. 

Not only does crime go way down, so do the amount of ppl needlessly locked up for non violent drug offences.

I refilled my Vyvanse two days ago and half of the bottle is gone.  Yesterday when I realized that I would run out early I decided to be an idiot and try to find someone to sell me something on reddit.  I seriously don't know how I thought that this would be a successful plan but I was convinced that it would work out.

I started talking to a guy that was going to overnight me some adderall.  I was really worried about getting ripped off or arrested so he video called me and showed me his face and probably about 200 very real looking pills.  I had always thought that my judgement with these things was pretty good but it must have been on vacation yesterday.  He was really nice and I didn't have any concerns after talking to him.  I apologized to him for taking so long while having trouble with the bitcoin app too and he offered to throw in a few extra for being a ""new customer"".  He said he wanted to make sure that I would buy from him again.

After I sent him the money he said that he was going to ship it out in the morning and he'd give me the tracking number.  Well guys.....the tracking number must be on vacation too because I never got it.  I was also blocked from calling or messaging him.  Oops.

I was so angry and embarrassed that I put myself in this position.  I was so desperate that I didn't spend any significant time researching his account or I would have seen that multiple people called him a scammer less than a week ago.  How could my judgement be so bad?  I used to work at a bank IN THE FRAUD DEPARTMENT!

I then had a moment of clarity and realized that I have taken over 900mgs of Vyvanse in 2 days and that this can't continue.

2021-04-22 12:23:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/mw8inl/interesting_paws_take/,Interesting PAWS take,"The following quoted text is from here  [PAWS? Science? : quittingkratom (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/mw2mq7/paws_science/)  and it is about Kratom, not amphetamine, but there may be some crossover re amphetamine PAWS.  It is from a self-described doctor who specializes in addiction mechanisms.  I have seen the general idea expressed elsewhere by experts. It is true I believe that PAWS is not in the DSM, though that does not mean it does not exist in one form or another. I have no reason to doubt this posters credentials but I have not confirmed them either.

""So if you look through my post history, I'm a doctor that specializes in mechanism of addiction.

Let me first start off by saying that PAWS is not a medical diagnosis and it was choosen to be omitted from the DSM-V due to lack of sufficient evidence.

Due to this it's very difficult to study because there is no strict definition of what PAWS is. If you cannot agree on a definition of something, you cannot systematically study it.

The general definition of PAWS is such that it means any negative symptom after acute drug withdrawal. When you have a definition that wide it's essentially meaningless.

We know that if you have 100 people quitting a drug and look at their symptoms at 90 days their symptoms don't differ from the general population, which means that quitting the drug does not cause lasting symptoms and symptoms are not caused by opioid receptor regulation.

However many patients do experience ongoing symptoms and so what causes this?

Well guess what, it's not the fact that drug is no longer bound to receptors. That is not what is happening.

What likely is happening is one of three things.

1. The experience of squiring and taking said drug and the experience of addiction (which is very stressful) changed the persons brain such that they now developed depression and anxiety, but were not aware of developing these conditions due to the masking effects of the drug.
2. The continual use of the drug damaged the brain and masked the effects while doing so. When I say damaged I'm referring to aberrant synaptic plasticity and rewiring. Under this hypothesis it's antithetical to continue taking a drug due to fear of PAWs, because your PAWS will get worse.
3. Nocebo effect. We know from clinical data that if a patient doesn't know of PAWS or has never heard of it, they almost never develop it. The expectation of paws makes people hypersensitive to any symptoms and given that a person in addiction likely had symptoms that caused them to self medicate with opioids or other drugs in the first place, it stands to reason that the persons symptoms would be worse after a long bout of addiction with a drug that masks the symptoms.

Clinically, PAWS has no definition, has never been proven to exist, and cannot be systematically studied because it's definition is too broad.

However, that doesn't mean that you are not experiencing symptoms that are not PAWS due to reasons 1, 2 and 3 listed above. The fact that you, who is not a physician is self-diagnosing oneself with PAWS does not make it so.

One thing to understand is that when you started taking Kratom, you were sick. There was something wrong with you that you needed to self medicate with Kratom. Then what did you do? You didn't get treatment for it, you self medicated for years without actually fixing the problem and it got worse without you knowing. So when you come off the drug, you think that it's the quitting of the drug that is causing your symptoms, but the reality is that the mechanisms of your symptomology have been there the whole time OR have been caused by the damage that drug abuse causes. Y

I'm an expert in this field, and if anyone in this thread attempts to give you explict mechanisms ( sertotonin/ dopamine/ mu receptor systems etc) for PAWS, they do not know what they are talking about. Receptor regulation and neurotransmitter release are what cause acute withdrawals. Once acute withdrawals are over your receptor levels are balance. If you continue to have symptoms after acute withdrawal-- it is caused by another mechanism that is not related to receptor regulation.""

I quit Adderall on August 2019. Prior to that, I had used occasionally from 2014 to 2017 and, then, daily from 2017 to 2019. My problems mostly arose from daily use.

Why did I originally quit? Well, like many of you, the comedowns were bad. I started developing an ""OCD"" about a trauma I had on my youth and would text my parents 100-150 times a day if I was abused. This isn't an exaggeration, it caused turmoil in my family. I also had to use massive amounts of marijuana on each comedown so I wouldn't spiral down to a depressive state.

However, I never once abused my prescription. I was taking 10-40 mg roughly during that period of use.

Looking back, I've been clean for 1.5 years, but the last 6 months, I have been so grossly unproductive it's ridiculous... Depressed is an under-statement. I literally do dopamine-seeking activities all day like browse reddit and check YouTube. I need some urgency to my situation, so I'm considering getting a script again for Adderall.

I say “sober” because I have smoked socially a couple of times, in isolation, but I never bought any or kept any on me after the socializing ended. So, that was the rule I made for myself when I got sober, that I would never own any of my own. (Because we all know how well that shit worked out the first time ‘round... ha!)

Anyway, after 5 months of facing the music of daily life, I bit the bullet and went to a doctor for depression. I was crying all the time (I’m not a cryer!), I was fat, I was scared of everything, the slightest obligation or decision to make sent me into an anxious despair and I’d just hide in bed. 

I’m not saying the 6 years of meth abuse caused this, but I’m pretty sure I wasn’t that bad before I started it...

Anyway, they checked hormones and thyroid and since that all came back normal, I was given Wellbutrin by a general doc over the phone. 

The next day (!) I felt better, I had energy, and I haven’t fantasized about my next “social smoke” session since. I’m happy because, I’m sure I would end up purchasing again, just a matter of time. I’d rather have nothing to do with it. 

I swear this drug (bupropion / Wellbutrin) is made for former tweakers. And there is no guilt or shenanigans regarding trying to prove ADHD in order to get Adderall while trying to not look like a shady motherfucker trying to score some Adderall. Just a good, honest 5 min chat about depression. 

I also mentioned weight gain, and wanting to stop smoking cigarettes, and she suggested Wellbutrin right away. 

If you’re struggling to stay sober - give this a shot. It might just help your dopamine survive without you turning to a relapse.

If you’re struggling with meth and want to get sober - let this give you some hope that there are medical options that might help you. 

I AM NOT A DOCTOR, and I never mixed meth and Wellbutrin, I am only advocating for its use ONCE you’ve stopped. 

That being said, I feel like if somebody said the following to me years ago, I could have gotten out of my addiction that much sooner:

“Get your script for depression and/or smoking cessation, and you don’t even have to quit meth until you have that script in hand. Then go through the hell of coming down, sleep for a week, and then wake up, take your Wellbutrin and live your life without looking back.”

If it’s not Wellbutrin, use pot, use friends, use manic exercise, use AA - you don’t have to do it alone. But don’t be ashamed to get some pharmaceutical support.

I genuinely never thought I'd ever want to get clean or manage to stay clean. I tried to rationalize my usage so much that I convinced myself it was helping me more than hurting me, and that life would be substantially worse without it. I got really intense comedowns all the time, and I convinced myself that if I stopped using, it would be like a permanent comedown. I had no idea what real sobriety felt like anymore, because I was always on some substance, usually Adderall, and when I wasn't ""on"" anything, I was coming down, or my brain was trying to recover from my excessive usage. I thought these experiences would be permanent if I stopped using, and they were so awful that I never even considered getting clean. To me, getting clean was synonymous with feeling like shit all the time, mentally and physically, so why would I do that to myself? 

I got clean, though. About three years in, I was using such high dosages that were probably really unhealthy for my body weight (and my heart condition), and I realized how cruel I was being to my body by constantly putting myself through this. I made a commitment to get clean, and I stuck with it. There were a bunch of times when I almost relapsed, but I didn't, and I'm proud of myself for it. 

It's almost unbelievable how much happier I am now. I'm physically and mentally the healthiest I've ever been, and I know it sounds fake, but I feel like a new person -- or, at the very least, the person I was before I started using. I came to this subreddit a lot in the early stages of getting clean, and reading through everyone's posts was super helpful for me. I feel like people don't talk about Adderall abuse a lot, since it's a prescription and there are plenty of cases where Adderall use isn't abuse. 

Anyway, this got long. If you're struggling with abuse, I really wish you the best. If you're trying to get clean, please know that it gets so much better as time goes on. I'm new to Reddit, but please feel free to message me if you ever need support!

In quick summary, I’ve been heavily addicted to stimulants for atleast 15 years now.  I was on a road to disability, and my life was had become devoid of relationships, happiness, and any sort of joy.  
In 2018 I went into a downward spiral after my dad’s sudden death, and after about 5 months in rehab, I came out even more lost and hopeless.  
Thankfully I joined an IOP with a brilliant doctor that was able to help me (in fact, he was so proud of my improvement, that he used me as the subject for a research paper on treating hopeless, treatment resistant body dysmorphia and stimulant dependence.  
My depression had completely lifted and I became motivated to pursue my lifelong goal, to become a doctor.
I got accepted into medical school, only to fall gravely ill with an aggressive COVID pneumonia.  Recovery took 4 months ,just in time for me to start my medical journey.
I was surprised, that at 36 years old, I was still at the peak of my game, and doing very well.  I had 1.5 years clean and was focusing without any help other then coffee.  
But I guess inevitably I relapsed... somehow I pulled myself through with honors in my first semester.
So what does a single guy who seemingly has changed his life around do next?  
Not even through direct intention , I had met a girl on an adderall discord server. We started to date and I thought I fell in love.  She was beautiful , smart , and could relate to the struggles we both shared.  I was her main source of support throughout her own withdrawl, and I actually thought that she was the only good thing that adderall ever gave me.  
Fast foward 1 month , she’s flirting with another man on discord, and from the time stamps, it was almost exactly when I was literally laying in bed with her thinking this is the woman of my dreams.  In fact , she had already fucked another man , and boasting her new love life with yet another man.  How am I supposed to take that , being insecure and vulnerable myself?  How am I supposed to feel about someone who claimed she loved me but didn’t even mention of my existence to others?  Well, to cut short , feeling like a worthless piece of shit that she scrapes off her shoe, I relapsed hard .  Very hard .I stopped all my meds and have regressed to some childhood state.  She has made me look like a jealous monster and honestly think she would hope that I just die quickly so she won’t have this “problem”. 
Well, if you’re reading this Laura, I just wanted to tell you that I’ve let go .  I accept that you’re a troubled person , and actually wish you the best . I’m in severe withdrawl , but sincerely wish you a good life.  But to close , I will achieve everything I set out to achieve .  I will match into residency , find success, and when you will be crying for help (and you will be), you’ll be insignificant and non existent to me at that point .
Hope to talk to anyone who can relate.

A brief backstory- I'm a 22 yr old who's struggled with substances. In high school I got really into RCs and supplements, and it progressively got worse, culminating in me kind of going off the rails, failing out of my dream college, and basically destroying nearly all of the relationships that were important to me. I then got a great job but destroyed that as well. Then I completed a rehab program (\~6months), during that time I stayed on my Vyvanse 70mg as I had been prescribed it already. I've been diagnosed Anxiety/ADHD/Depression but I'm not even sure what these labels mean anymore. 

Anyways a bit about me, parents thought I had autism/Aspergers when I was young. I was really into computers, I've been coding since middle school, had a few run-ins with the law due to computer hacking. I didn't feel like I belonged with kids my age really, but online I found I was accepted and even liked on ""underground"" communities, I guess populated with others like me who feel separate in some way. I guess maybe everyone feels that way to some extent, but I'm not sure. 

Anyways, over time I developed this passion and skills around computer programming and security. But the whole time I was also on and off a variety of substances. Now fast-forward to today and I've relapsed I guess by starting to take Lyrica/Pregabalin without an rx, and also abusing my vyvanse. I have zero desire to dig a hole for myself again, so I'm contemplating quitting both, as soon as possible (I figure once my summer vacation starts in 2-3 weeks and I don't have to worry about school).

&#x200B;

tldr

The problem is I don't know who I am without these substances. Particularly with my interests, computer programming/security, they really ""help"" in the short-term by increasing my ""productivity."" Now I'm questioning if these things are really my interests, was it me or just me on the substance. What if I'm not so good at these things without external help? I want to be free of all substances, but I'm afraid of what that means for me.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5144874}"

I really love injecting cocaine. It more or less ruined my life and when I hit rock bottom, 7 and a half months ago, that's when i decided to get clean.

I mean the entire time I was clean, I was constantly reminded of my addiction in my dreams, and every day life. Cant escape it. It literally haunts me day after day. I'm sure most of you can relate to the constant cravings. The weird part is, I think I miss using the needle as much as I miss coke. The ritual of getting shots ready is an addiction in of itself. 

Anyways, I digress. About 2 months ago i had an idea, since I'm always gonna want to do coke, and the likelihood of me staying clean forever is about zero, I can moderate my addiction by using the occasional relapse as a reward for myself, if I complete certain goals I set for myself.

So, I came up with a couple goals that  would take me about a year to complete. Andddd thata where I fucked up. Immediately after that the dreams of using went into over drive, and I started feinding. So I guess my breaking that mental barrier and ""allowing"" myself to use in the future, my brain said fuck it lets do it now. 

So anyways, here I am, post relapse sitting up in bed because if I lay down I feel like I'm drowning. But I learned something from all of this. 

I cant control my addiction. Theres no half measures. It's either I'm going to use or I'm not. Theres no ""rewarding"" myself. That was literally just my brain trucking me into relapse.

(throwaway acct for obv reasons)

I've always had an adderall connect, it was too easy and cheap to get them. But for a long time I was very cautious and careful (years) about overusing them. I had one hard lesson where I took it too often and ended up feeling depressed, but the dosage was relatively low so the effects weren't this extreme. This was a few years ago, and I thought I had learned my lesson, but it seems I was ready to push the envelope again thinking I could handle it. 

Fast forward to 2020 where this individual has an even higher prescription of IR now and I still get them for insanely cheap. Anyway I start using it to be more productive, crank out things I need to crank out, but at some point I started to take them because I was bored. What I didn't realize was happening was that I was taking them to offset the imbalance they were creating in the first place. Over a period of 6 months I became addicted and started to justify taking them every day, and when it stopped being fun, it really stopped being fun. I entered a cycle of guilt and anxiety, ""You need to stop this"" during the comedown and then the next day, ""Eh what's the harm? You're fine again."" Rinse and repeat for months and voila, you have an addiction. 

Unmotivated. Bored.  Massive mood swings I'm not used to. Fatigued but can't sleep. Meal skipping constantly, and I have some body dysmorphia so I always internally justified it. I developed insomnia for the first time in my life and for almost 4 days, I could not fall asleep. Not even with OTC sleep aids like benadryl. I would just stay awake while it hit. My life became miserable and that's when I put my foot down.

You cannot abuse adderall (amphetamines) responsibly. You will lose eventually, and if you're in the honeymoon stage right now, you're going to tell yourself you're fine and you're different from me, you're doing it ""the right way"".

So I want to get into a routine and want to try putting in work and take small step each day without falling back into that vicious cycle, also I want to learn to forgive myself.


I know yall no therapists but I think some of you felt similar and can relate to those feelings more then my family or friends can and maybe have some advice.

The higher the climb, the lower the fall

I have gone from the top of the world to the depths of despair in the blink of an eye. 

I’ve been lurking for weeks reading everyone’s posts. They have given me a glimmer of hope. I am the girl who always has something to say and who talks nonstop even without drugs and until now I have tried multiple times to write a post but couldn’t even articulate how I was feeling. Sorry for the novel guys. 


30F. Misdiagnosed with ADD 15 years ago in 9th grade. Was prescribed full doses of vyvanse and adderall simultaneously until 2016. At 17 i completed my first IOP program. Since then I’ve gone to detox, inpatient and completed IOP/PHP programs too many times to count. I haven’t taken any amphetamines in a while mainly because they’re hard to find. I never was exposed to crystal growing up & used to joke w my friends “can you imagine if I did crystal meth?? Thank God I don’t do crystal meth.” Because I already knew that it would be psycho. 

      In December 2018 I tried crystal for the first time. Since then I have had various lengths of sobriety & went to rehab twice. The longest amount of time I had was 9 months until I relapsed this past October. Since trying it in 2018 I have had 5 periods of binges, which in total don’t even add up to a year. 

     I have had two teeth pulled in the last two years. Have a third that will have to be pulled next week. I’m a type two diabetic and it has contributed to my awful neuropathy. I have gone to the ER twice this year, within 3 days, for severe dehydration. I have trigger finger in both my hands majority of the time. My skin is picked to shreds. I go into psychosis often. I’m scared of my own shadow. I accidentally hurt myself regularly. I spend more money on pedialyte & icy hot & other treatments for my drug-induced ailments than I do on actual ice!!!! I am a hot fucking mess to say the least....

       I have never felt this hopeless about getting sober again. I usually am quite confident, I know exactly what to do to create lasting sobriety. This time is different- It’s darker. It’s so much bigger than me and I honestly feel like I don’t stand a chance. It’s like a black mass that follows me everywhere and I can’t escape it. I know that my addiction does want me dead. That’s it’s job, to fucking kill me, right? 

     I don’t know who I have become. Who that monster is in the mirror. The shell of a girl who used to be everyone’s most positive & happy-go-lucky friend. 

     Meth- The devil I know. It’s just plain evil. Cunning baffling & powerful. I am paying an extremely high price to destroy everything around me. My body hates me, my soul is gone & my spirit broken. But, I found my holy grail after all these years. Now that I’ve tasted this, how could I ever give this up???? How??? It’s honestly such a mind fuck because I end up feeling 100x worse than the initial negative emotions I use to escape from. There is no better living through chemistry. It’s all a fucking lie. The human body is NOT meant to feel this good ever. It’s just not. It’s not authentic, it’s superficial as fuck. 

     I want sobriety. I want peace of mind. I want my 3yr old son to grow up with his mother and be proud of her one day. I don’t wanna break my parents hearts anymore or make my mother cry. I want to make myself proud. It’s really simple- give up everything for one thing OR give up one thing for everything. Why is this even up for debate? Well, because I have so many reservations. I’ve never stayed sober longer than 9 months over the course of 13 years. History has shown that it never seems to stick long-term which I believe leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy of my relapses. FEAR- Failure expected and received. Fear runs my life. It is my jailer. Everyday I am sentenced to my very own hell. Sobriety is like a carrot dangling in front of my face but I can’t quite reach it. It seems like the most unattainable of goals.

     I was supposed to end my binge this past weekend but I am terrified of coming down. I slept last night (thankfully) & had one small line to get me through work today. Then I’m gonna buy some more weed to combat the inevitable comedown. Tomorrow I am getting the vivitrol shot. In 2019 I got the shot for 4 months to kill my cravings & when I didn’t get my 5th shot I relapsed. I can’t help but believe there is a correlation here!! I take Wellbutrin as well and as many of you probably know there are new studies suggesting the vivitrol/Wellbutrin duo for methamphetamine addicts. 

      I want to start working out for the endorphins and so that I don’t gain all my weight back. I have a top-notch therapist. I have decided to try SMART Recovery because I like the CBT approach. I also want to try Life Ring which is a secular sobriety program. AA will always be my home & I strongly believe in its principles & the effectiveness of step work but I feel like it’s time to try something different. I don’t hangout w tweakers so I honestly don’t have a lot of people to cut out of my life which is a plus. My boyfriend is a recovering alcoholic and is so supportive. My child’s dad as well as my parents are also very supportive and I am very fortunate. I know what needs to happen. 

      My problem isn’t lack of knowledge but lack of application of that knowledge. The only thing in my way is ME. If a better life if what you want, you first have to take off the noose. People don’t change til it hurts bad enough. Although I don’t quite yet want to be sober more than I want to use, it fucking hurts y’all. I’m ready to get out of my own way. I want to be the comeback kid. Every hero has adversity in their past otherwise they wouldn’t be a good hero. & lastly, as Bukowski once said- “if you’re worried about losing your soul you still have soul left to lose”

My ADHD symptoms came back worse than ever. I couldn't focus on anything, and I'm just way too pumped up to functionally direct my energy and I (probably foolishly) ended up taking a 7.5mg tablet, after waking up for the 3rd time, going downstairs and eating handfuls of cheddar cheese from the refrigerator. It seems so pathetic, but it's the truth. Just mindlessly eating, and it had me terrified. I definitely feel bad about taking the tablet because I'm afraid it could lead to more tablets., though I'm going to make sure that's the case. I have got to be able to control myself. I didn't get rid of the tablets, and I probably should have- though it has been my choice to quit taking them because of how they make me feel.   


If it's not my choice it's not going to stick. I need to be able to have them there- and not choose them to win this battle.  I'm not so sure I can deal with my ADHD symptoms. I have got to see if I can be prescribed a nonstimulant for my ADHD. I feel like I'm cornered by these pills, because they were super helpful in the past when I was doing it right, but I fear that now I would never be able to do that. They wear off, and I feel awful, and it just want another one to make that feeling go away. I fall for it every single time. No matter what, every time I take this medicine I feel defeated at the end of the day and alarms are going off in my head letting me know I have a poor relationship with the medicine.

 I lost everything to this this drug, my personality, my hobbies, my real life friends (I only have friends Online at this point), my realitionship to my girlfriend of 1 year that was very loving and supporting is suffering she can't handle my addiction and realized she can't stay in this relationship if I don't get serious help and work on my problems and behaviour.

It's been very rough the past month since I had a serious borderline episode and almost died in her arms after impulsively overdosing on ghb and alcohol because of a rather stupid reason that left both of us traumatized, 

my family is also suffering very badly since I isolate myself for days in my room when using and not talking to them or even looking them in the eyes, it fucked up my mental health very badly I can't even describe how fucked I am mentally it feels like my brain just stopped developing at some point and I'm stuck at the age of 16 or something.

I do not work and I think I'm also not able to maintain a stable job with my current state on mind, I was able to live off my parents since I didn't need much of anything other then food and water all the speed I got extremely cheap either from my older brother (15 years long speed addict lives in the same house as me) that sometimes gives me a couple grams for free or I get it from the internet where you get quality speed paste for insanely low prices.

I am sick of how my life is right know I'm sick to my stomach of not being able to stop for more then a month without either relapsing or start turning to other drugs like kratom, ghb or alcohol while being sober for a while.

Whenever I take speed nowadays I just do basically nothing then sitting infront of my pc for days not eating drinking giving a fuck about my hygiene sleeping or leaving my room for other things then using the toilet browsing twitter or reddit for hours and being an absolute cringe bastard while texing people while being psychotic and regret every word I said when I come down. Being high feels like being trapped in a prison I built myself that I can't move out of. It feels like I'll be hopelessly trapped in this hellish state forever because whenever I'm sober I want to go straight back and experience this crazy self mutulating hell all over again because I seem to forget how much it fucks me up each and every time.

I will most likely get downvoted. I am a pathatic selfish loser and a very bad individual that takes all of his life for granted and just throws it away for some high that is no where near enjoyable. 

I want to change but I have no idea where to even start since I failed so many times trying to get off these fucking drugs I lost track of how often I relapsed.

The flow of life in my local community, visiting the shops and grabbing dinner and my morning coffee. Is just really lovely. Really wonderful. I’m super lucky that I live near the beach in a beautiful part of the world. But I’ve always lived here and for the years leading up to this recovery I had no appreciation, no gratitude for where I lived. But more so I just wasn’t comfortable being “part of” any community or life no matter where I was. Today I love just being with my kids. Having my morning coffee. Going for a swim. Having dinner and hanging out. It’s hard to articulate but I just never got any joy or pleasure or freedom from anything other than getting high. Today I get all my pleasure from such simple things. Things that are available to me all the time and at no cost. And I feel so grateful to have discovered it. To have discovered that life in all its simplicity is just really beautiful. And all I need.

Abstinence is really hard but it’s possible and it gets much easier with time : which I never believed. Not for this addict. I’d stopped and started and relapsed and fucked up and let myself and my kids and my parents down SO MANY times that I just figured it wasn’t possible to get and stay sober. And coming off meth was just unbelievably hard because I had no energy and no drive and I gained weight and felt hopeless for many, many months. And in truth it was a bitch for a year. I felt some glimmer of hope around 5-6 months and now and again I’d make a bit of progress but it was a grind like I’ve never experienced. If I’d seen a psychologist they would have put me on anti depressants for sure. But I didn’t - I just put one day in front of the other. I decided if I wanted a life I couldn’t go backwards again. I couldn’t pick up again. I committed with all my soul to sticking it out and not picking up no matter what. And after a year things started to change. I started to change. Life started to get easier. I saw glimpses of the old me. My mum died and I could be by her side in her final days and speak at her funeral. My kids saw me fortnightly in 43 supervised visits - and I showed up for every single one of them. On time and with love and compassion - for them and for me. And as the days and months went on the desire to use and my commitment to abstinence grew - and so did my love of life and sobriety. Today I can’t quite believe I’m 1000 days clean and sober from all mind altering substances. That meth is just a distant memory that holds zero appeal. Today I know I have a choice - stay sober and move forward with joy and love in my life; or pick up and destroy everything I hold dear and go back to loneliness and misery. I know I can keep making the right decision for the rest of my life one day at a time.

I couldn’t quit meth or stay sober on my own : by myself I am powerless over addiction, as part of a recovery community and a fellowship of other addicts I’m part of something bigger than me and it’s absolutely key to me staying sober. I spend many years trying to get and stay sober from alcohol and stimulants. I got past 90 days 8 times from 2012 to 2018. I went to 3 rehabs. I tried moderation, hypnotherapy, AA, NA, self help, self will. I could stop, but I couldn’t stay stopped. This is the longest I’ve ever been sober. 1000 days. I’ve done it by committing totally to 12 steps in NA and AA. I got a sponsor, worked the steps. I call other addicts every day. I meditate every day. I open meetings in my local area. In 1000 days I’ve attended over 1000 meetings. I don’t for a moment believe this is the only way to get and stay sober and know it isn’t for everyone - but it’s what I’ve done and it has worked for me. The biggest single ingredient is the sense of community and belonging I feel combined with the fact I take ACTION every single day to invest in my recovery. I take it really seriously and I spent 60-90 minutes a day in action around my recovery. Today it feels effortless and gives me an anchor point for everything else in my life. I have a community of people I connect and check in with as I go about my daily life of family and friends and work. I tried for a long time to get sober my own way - but following the 12 step suggestions has worked for me and I really love being part of it today. In the future I may well do less meetings but right now - a commitment of 60-90 minutes a day and staying closely connected to other addicts and their recovery has given me a new life and for that I’m immensely grateful. Take what you want from this and leave the rest but whatever you do - try and get connected to others who are trying to live a better life.

I have ADHD and my medicine (Adderall) has gotten out of hand. I'm tired of the compulsive behaviors, like hiding away in my room so I can ""touch myself"", I know I have ADHD but I think I will be fine just being me. It has to be better. Things have to get better. 

I initially worked with my doctor and reduced my prescribed dose down from 60mg daily to only 7.5mg, but as soon as I get the tablets from the pharmacy I take at least 60mg worth over the span of the first day, I don't even keep track. I have been disrespecting myself that much. I have no self control. I feel terrible and fatigued, then go off them for one or two days, and then the urge returns. I take more of the pills. Too many of the 7.5mg tablets.

 I'm not going to let my doctor give me another prescription for Adderall. If she wants to try a non stimulant that is fine,  but I can't so this anymore guys. I take the pills, lay in bed and do my thing for so long, and I hurt so bad and feel so foolish afterwards, and like I've let everyone who invested their time and energy in me down unless I can rid myself of this problem. It's becoming physically painful to take the pills, it's never helpful for my ADHD like it used to be, they used to help me focus but now I never get anything done.

That being said, once I start and eventually crash, the depression that comes next makes it almost impossible for me to stay stopped as I eventually give in. 

I’m scared. Scared because previously I’d stop and accept help (get into treatment) when my body could literally take it no more and I’d have no other choice.

I was prescribed 40 mgs of adderall a day and took it normally. I had been on it 11 years roughly. Then, one day my normal dose had me hallucinating and completely losing touch with reality. I was sent to a mental facility for evaluation. The adderall caused me to have an unwanted ""trip"", or substance induced psychosis. I was so addicted to adderall I had overlooked the paranoia leading up to this point. I knew I was chemically dependent on adderall, but I didn't know the detriment it was causing to my brain health and wellbeing.

Apparently this is more common than what is heard about. I was told this medicine is a ticking time bomb for a psychosis event. I didn't know that before. I'm recovered and not on adderall anymore. Just dealing with normal PAWS. 

Be cautious using adderall regularly. One might think substance induced psychosis can only happen from binging or abusing a substance very aggressively. No, it can happen just by using it as prescribed.

Yesterday, I found myself procrastinating from my uni assignments and indulging in usual ADHD symptoms, so I took 10mg of Dexedrine - 5mg about an hour apart, around about 4pm and 5pm. As my previous post outlines, I have entertained the thought for a while.

Today, there is a mild level of day after brain fogginess and some guilt. Overall, however, I do not believe I have reset my progress. On the contrary, it was a refreshing reminder that it is not the panacea that recent dreams or fantasies have led me to believe. Today, as I've found myself procrastinating, my mind is no longer going to ""therapeutic use"" but certain skills I've tried learning over the years.

There was about 1-2 hours level of greater clarity, focus, self-confidence, some mild euphoria, but I was quickly reminded of all the negatives about 2 hours in: the anxiety, greater levels of intrusive thinking, self-doubt, increased memory loss, heart palpations, the paranoia being more concrete and acute (as opposed to my non-Dexedrine anxiety being more subtle) and feeling less like a human and more like a shell. The day ended with an hour masturbation session, which was immensely enjoyable; I sincerely doubt it would have been so prolonged nor obsessive if it were not for the Dexedrine.

I know 10mg is nothing in the grand scheme of things, but it did feel as if I was back to where I was over a year ago. And, while today I am grateful that the honeymoon period is well and truly over, there is a greater temptation again - both for productivity and the association with euphoric masturbation - since it is now so fresh in my mind. There's some mild thoughts of having 5-10mg again today to curb the mild mental fogginess, but I know how that starts. And I currently rationalize that I can afford to do about 5-10mg on the weekends when I need to study.  And, really, I think I can have that level of control; I'm proud of myself for only having 10mg and not having anything the next day. But my issue is that even such mild doses just resurrect all the negatives about an hour or two after dose unless I keep redosing. Those negatives will never go away. The ship has well and truly sailed.

When it comes to productivity, and curbing ADHD symptoms, I need to continue cultivating my own inner resources. Still, I am a bit scared the cat is out of the bag. We shall see.

Took medium-to strong doses for seven days straight. I stopped when on the 2nd of this month I'm pretty sure I ODed. I had a four hour long anxiety attack, gasping for breath, my whole body felt f$cked up, heart about ready to beat out of my chest, felt like I was about to just lose it. I didn't even take an extreme dose, 40mg orally, which I know is high but nothing insane. Day two now, the drugs been out of my system for 51 hours and I still feel horrible.

My whole body feels damaged. My heart is acting odd, I keep on getting these weird sensations throughout my body. I seriously felt like yesterday at one point my heart really did just almost give out (although I did also take 10mg of hydrocodone to take some of the pain/anxiety away, stupid.) Worst anxiety of my life and, while the anxiety is subsiding to an extent now, I am having horrid depression. Should I go to the hospital? Did I permanently F myself up? Is my body in danger of failing me any second now and am I about to die? Will this ever end?

Never touching this crap again. Again, should I go to the hospital and come clean (no pun intended.) Even my Adderall and Vyvanse binges never put me through anything like this.

\*Edit: Forgot to mention too, right before and at the beginning of my meth binge I took ten 0.5mg Klonopins in the span of one week. While its doubtful I'm experiencing full on withdrawals I am probably having some rebound anxiety from that which isn't helping.

I'm finally at a point in my life where my relationships are great, my physical health is great, I have a very promising career ahead of me. And today an old acquaintance who I used to smoke meth with in the past contacted me, I picked up his phone not knowing it was him. And he offered that I take a few hits with him, I declined politely multiple times, he kept insisting and I couldn't fight the urge. I ended up smoking with him for a couple of hours, Talking and talking which I feel especially stupid about. I don't like talking about my personal life with people I'm not very close too.

I kinda tapered off Elvanse and on off after uni just to feel a buzz or something.

2 years later i got the opportunity to finish off my last year of Uni about 5 month ago, i was off Elvanse for a few month and i felt good, like i understood the concept of how to learn, like doing things little by little, it takes time to get good at things, its not easy and i was going for a run in the morning which was a next high on its own, but i convicted myself maybe i can do better work with elvanse because im going slow but that turned bad and now with 1 month left  i havent done much uni work other than be addicted to the feeling of Elvanse, The amount of no sleep days i get is actually worrying me, its making me lose hair and making me look shit and maybe older but still i take it, sometimes it make me a do a bit of work but i know if i kept exercising and just kept going little by little progress i would have done wayy more than I have. instead i went to gaming, wanking so so much, not sleeping well and just feeling bad about life. So much is wrong with Elvanse, and to top it off i take more then 70mg when i do take it because my tolerance is so high. when i stop i feel soo sleepy and tired then its like a never ending cycle.

So in my late teens and early 20s i binged adderall  and then started using meth, luckily i was able to drop the meth after a few monts off abuse, the adderall was more off a weekends thing. I stopped for almost 2 years then one night tried Dex and was addicted, i would binge this constantly, losing jobs, friends, getting further from everybody so i stopped the dex.

The worst decision i would ever make would follow shortly after, i relapsed and went hard on a dex binge and thought hey lets see if i can get this prescribed to me, sure enough i head to the doctors and he gives me a prescription, every refill i would slam through the bottle right away then go back to my dealer to get more i kept doing this and eventually changed my prescription to adderall. I would do the same with this. It got really bad and my girlfriend who doesnt touch the stuff who has been there since the beggining eventually told me this cant keep happening and she was leaving, i begged her to stay and told her i would get rid of the prescription.

And I actually did I quit for over a year then i begin to thing maybe i do have ADHD and convinced my self I could ""control"" my self and do the perscribed amount so I was told Vyvanse was less addictive, Got a prescription for Vyvanse and off course did the whole bottle right away, I have this on a 2month refill period, i get the bottle binge over 3-5 days then just stop and convince myself i wont get the next refill, off course i always do. I see the shadow people the spiders and the one i hate the most is CLEARLY hearing people in my house speaking in my head saying how awful i am and how much off an addict I am when i know they wouldnt say this or when they arent even there, i hear the voices clearly

As I type this i'm coming down from a 3 day Vyvanse binge and I started feeling a little better reading this reddit, even to be able to type this and share my story makes me feel a little bit better, I know i need to quit doing this, i can tell my girlfriend is almost done again, the fact shes even been with me through all off this the broken promises the porn binges the lies. I know I need to do this for my health and for her.

&#x200B;

As a final question for people who have quit, what do you find controls the urges or helps you get past the crashs? i've used alcohol for way too long to try and get past this (obviously not a good idea)

Thank you everybody and i really believe this will be the last prescription refill I get I have promised my girlfriend i am going to call the doctor on monday and explain that I cant be prescribed stimulants I am an addict.",18,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.62911713}"

I joined this sub and Reddit in general to both see people trying to get clean from meth and people still doing meth. I haven’t posted in here in a while so I’ll just do one because it’s interesting looking over past posts from a year up until now. I have 2 sponsees in AA and now I’m back in school. I have the same job and I got a gym membership about a month ago. I workout at least 4 days out of the week but haven’t lost any weight. I have gained some muscle. I wish I could lose weight working out as quickly as not eating on meth. Still in my relationship from before my relapse over 16 months ago . It’s difficult to meet her needs which really aren’t much but for whatever reason I’m kind emotionally detached even though I do love her. I find myself thinking about smoking weed and driving my car or having a drink at a bar and realizing those things won’t bring me any joy. I also got a dog for girlfriend. The dog is ok but I miss my dog that died last year and find myself comparing them. No dog will ever be as a good of a boy as my dog that passed so I take that out on the dog and my girlfriend. I love my girlfriend but sometimes I just want my own space and just want to be alone. Maybe I like the gym because I get to be alone there .",17,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49051502}"

Lying in bed now in agony. The melatonin worked but I’m still up obviously. I have to get off this crap. Half a decade if this filth has literally turned me into a subhuman.

We’re both codependent, so being separated will be a good thing. He’s going in because he just can’t seem to quit meth (addict for 3 years), no matter how badly he wants to quit, he would relapse once a week. When he didn’t use meth, he’d just switch to beer. When he didn’t drink, he’d use meth again, and the cycle would continue. Weed was always daily, multiple times a day.

He voluntarily went to inpatient today. He dropped everything to focus on his recovery and nothing else. I am SOOOO happy he actually went through with it!

I hope this is the end of that drug fueled horrible nightmare, and he comes out sober and dedicated to his recovery, so then FINALLY we can focus on our future.",61,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5003101}"

I decided that I would be quitting meth and everywhere I read said withdrawal would start 24 hours after last use and they talk 
About having chest spasms after 48 hours in for 3-10 days.

I’m only at 18 hours after last use and am having whole body convulsions and bouts of confusion which all together are pretty debilitating, I am writing in between episodes. Which has taken me about an hour to write all of this.

I am curious if anyone knows or has suggestions on what would be a effective way to alleviate some of the convulsions. And curious to why I started before the 24 hour mark and why it’s been so intense right out the gate, everywhere online that iv read says after 48 hours is the most intense and that it’s for 3-10 days.

If anyone has anything I’d love hear it because the thought of it getting worse two days from possibly a week scares the shit out of me, THANK YOU MUCH!🙏

I figure my dopamine receptors are messed up from nearly 2 years of heavy use along with other stimulants. Not exactly sure the extent of it’s truth or how long it takes to heal. Used to take stimulants prescribed to me now, like adderall, with no problems. Now it really takes a toll on me and I become incredibly stressed and paranoid. Unfortunately it’s a health for wealth trade off. 
I only know of Lions Mane and certain cannabanoid CBD derivatives, like CBC and CBG, that have been scientifically proven to heal nerve damage and repair/heal brian cells.. also magic mushrooms but I’d rather not psych myself lol. 
If anyone has any thoughts please comment! I’d love to hear some different perspectives because I’m still struggling after 1 year of no use.
