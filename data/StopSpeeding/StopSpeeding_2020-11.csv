Quick background: I was a heavy alcohol abuser my entire adult life... crippling anxiety my whole life starting in high school that I self-medicated to alleviate. Drank copious amounts towards the end. I eventually kicked it for good, and in the process started really focusing on personal growth. Therapy, Psychiatrist, intense exercise regimen, diagnosis and treatment for sleep apnea, diet change, etc. One thing I uncovered in therapy and with a psychiatrist, is I have pretty severe ADHD, which I basically knew all along. It was suggested that my anxiety and substance abuse could stem from complications of this disorder.

I started treatment with Adderall. 10mgx2 was first titrated dose. Could've been sugar pills for all I knew, didn't even notice them. Next dose was 20mgx2, could feel them, but not much of a noticeable improvement. I also work a full 12 hours, and 2 doses wears off by like 1-2pm for me. So it was upped to 20mgx3. Eventually switched psychiatrists for one that my therapist recommended, and explained her my situation. She told me to try 30mg x 2 for a week and see what that does.

So I did. And wow. It legitimately works. Still wears off before 2, but even with that I have more productive days than I ever have before. But I want this treatment for a full day. So I'm going to report back and suggest that 30x3 is ideal for me.

I have very few side effects. Some increase in HR and BP but nothing to scary levels. If I wanted to, I could go to sleep an hour after dosing. I get 7-9 hours of sleep per night.

All that being said, I have seen some horror stories on here, and some of them involve people completely falling off the rails on a dose I'm currently at, or taking the dose I want to move to. That scares the shit out of me, because I know what it's like to have a substance consume your life.

ADHD has severely crippled my life, and prior to treatment was causing serious issues in my marriage since we run a business together. I really do want to treat it. But fuckin a, this sounds like a scary drug! I can see the allure to it, as it makes me productive and in a better mood.

Am I playing with fire? Should I bail on this shit to be on the safe side? Obviously you folks know the dangers of it much better than I do.",1

Luckily I go into a residential rehab facility next week and look forward to getting thru this and living sober, not constantly worrying about dying from an OD or freak interaction or who knows what else. I've been a poly-drug user for over 6 years now and when I saw how fast I got dependent on meth I decided it's time to pull the plug on getting loaded at all.

My psychiatrist is having me start 4 medications to help with preexisting mental conditions and I was wondering if anyone else has had the experience of quitting an addiction to amphetamines while being on any of these drugs or quit and later started taking one or more of them: I have read some people have found Welbutrin (bupropion) useful for the post-use depressive stages. Has anyone getting clean been prescribed Latuda, Clonidine, or Propranolol during that time? What did they do for you?",3

Then there’s a chance I still wouldn’t get the shit done that I have been not dealing with and they’d take literally forever on something ridiculous and I’d be over it and annoyed and we wouldn’t get sleep and I’d feel awful (yet again) for my visit to my family and shit would be coming out of my pores where my skin was healing. And then a chance I’d be hiding in the bathroom snorting because I can’t smoke there and then I’d be absolutely desperate for a cig and make up a lame excuse to run an errand and sneak one and return and be overly sensitive and stick to apocalyptic type of conversation topics and be so utterly drained by the time I drive home. And then a chance it would continue for days again like it used to while I feel worse and worse and get crazier and crazier and need more and more and dig the hole I’m in deeper and deeper.

But I think I’m going to sit here on this bed and ignore my texts. Circumvent my damaged prefrontal cortex and play the long game tonight. With a bunch of stuff left to do before I leave in the morning but resting and letting some of the bad feelings in that have been making everything...heavy. And maybe a few good ones too. Tired but calm knowing I did my absolute best today and there’s also a chance this can be the first of many times I make this choice until it’s easier and I start really healing.

I don’t want to go through bad addiction/withdrawal again, but this combo just seems to cause really bad anxiety/jitteriness sometimes, not to mention the variable nature of kratom, sometimes making me feel awake, other times making me feel a bit drowsy.

They were essentially feelings of impending doom that I would attribute to relatively inconsequential things and wildly blow out of proportion.

Issue is, I'm nearing 5 months of sobriety from amphetamines, yet the relief of time seems to have stopped about 2 months ago. I haven't experienced any further mental improvement since the start of October. If anything it's getting worse again. That aside, the only lasting benefit I've had is that I no longer have nightmares revolving around doing drugs. 

I talked through the paranoia with a friend who told me that I'm over reacting and that it really is only in my head. That these scenarios that are crippling me won't come to pass. Unfortunately it all feels so real, like I've got to take action to prevent some horrible life altering tragedy.

Unsure if it's related, though I had a tumour removed along with part of a non-essential organ almost a month ago. I dont feel nearly as terrible about that as I do these symptoms of withdrawal however. Part of me almost wants a bad pathology report because I'm not about this kind of life.

I need help, please, any further advice or experiences would be really appreciated. I don't want to live with this forever.",4

I tried to stop on my own afew times but I couldn't keep my life together and recover at the same time so I always went back. Nobody ever knew. I got arrested when my probation officer came to the house and everything was in plain sight. I was honest and showed him where everything else was. It really felt like a blessing in disguise. Still wanna give that guy a hug. I did 45 days in jail. I dealt with the usual devastation of going to jail and after sleeping alot and getting some muscle back,I was actually happy and hopeful while I was in there. I ended up getting put into drug court. Another blessing. I have no intentions of getting high again. Im finally past the initial uselessness of withdrawal and i refuse to go back. But when I was in jail the love of my life moved to Florida and wants nothing to do with me. I went from happy and hopeful to dying inside. When I used i was a positive and spiritual person. Not saying it was the drugs,that was just my state of being. I used to listen to ghostmane when I was high just because I liked the bass. Didnt really relate to the lyrics,much less listen to them. I didnt even like all of the songs. Now i listen to his music,all of it,and i completely relate to every single word. It scares the shit out of me. If anyone told me this darkness existed I would've told them to cheer up,be positive. Blown it off completely as nonsense. But I keep finding all this dark music and visual symbology to reflect my internal state. Im not psychotic enough to think that it was made for me. I think this is a place that alot of people go to. Im worried ill never be that spiritual positive guy again. I dont want to do anything. I dont even really wanna die. But it can't be the drugs. I was the same old me before I got out of jail and found my world in shambles. The thought of ever being with anyone else makes me want to vomit. I feel like my polarity has been flipped on its head and I can't even do drugs to fix it. I refuse to. Well,meth atleast. I have a san Pedro cactus that I planted acouple years ago. It was  about 3 1/4 feet tall and I cut about 3 feet off. I kept the top to replant and made the rest into Huachuma (cactus tea). I plan on drinking it tomorrow. I dont even want anything out of it. I asked the plant to take me where it wanted,ill surrender. Idk if it will be heaven or horror,due to my internal state. I dont even care man. I just don't want this to be where I reside. I see so many people like ghostmane coming from that dark place,and it seems like they've been there awhile.",5

that’s the thing. drugs have never really agreed with me. seven times out of ten, i’ve had an awful time with drugs before or after or nothing’s really happened. i just keep seeking them out.

even when i started getting better friends, i still felt the need to take substances. when i was 15, i took acid. i came off my medication to do it but nothing happened regardless. the next day i was in a bad state. i was throwing up everywhere and crying. i was at a large meet-up with loads of people i knew and there was a lot of talk about the state i was in. i kept begging people for valium so i could calm down but obviously no one had any. i got concerned messages.

the thing is, it’s been over three years since then and those desperate situations have happened many times. sometimes it was just with weed alone but also with many other substances. at a festival in 2019, i was constantly taking drugs all weekend. i ended up in the medical tent on the last night because i had a breakdown.

after that festival, i went down a bad path with amphetamine use. i took it four times a week at one point and all of my closest friends noticed and were upset and exasperated by the situation. it was the time where my problematic drug use was most obvious.

recently i’ve been struggling again with cocaine. i’ve tried to pretend it isn’t an issue but every time i’m drunk it’s all i can think about. i get drunk and end up sneaking off to blow my money on cocaine. the thing is people rarely join in, it’s usually just me. people would be concerned but they just don’t notice, i pretend everything is okay. i’m trying to deal with it on my own, with no one knowing but i’m so embarrassed. i take it and wake up the next day and all i feel is embarrassment and regret. i’m disgusted with myself.

it’s only now that i realise that i’ve got this weird fixation on substances and i haven’t really been able to deal with this for four years. it’s like a long term problem that keeps coming back. even when i go ‘sober’. i’m actually in drugs counselling but i think my problem goes deeper. it’s a strange fixation and need that i can’t really stop, i always fall back into patterns.",4

Update 12/21/20: 
I went cold turkey on december 4th and I'm just now feeling like my old self again. I slept a lot considering I slept frequently while using. I sadly used last night after 16 days of detoxing.

I don’t have any drive to do anything beyond running a few times per week and doing yoga, which I mostly do for my mental health. 



Nothing really excites me, nothing really feels good. I’m wondering how much of this is PAWS vs. regular old depression (which I suspect had been pushed aside from taking pills.)



I’ve previously worried about people saying they feel like a zombie or lose their ability to have sex, but fuck I feel like that anyways. Starting to wonder if I should see a psychiatrist in addition to my therapist. But shit at that point... do I just get my own adderall script and say fuck it?

Throughout my time on this group I've read lots of discussions about prescription medications. I'd like to know what has worked for people and what hasn't, which has had intense side affects and which did nothing at all.

 A little back story on me. I've been working on my sobriety for over a year. I was stuck with psychiatrist that was strictly for med management and I never felt like he heard me, through out that time I was on Wellbutrin 300XL and an antihistamine as needed for panic attacks. The last time we met I approached him with a list of meds people here have had success with. He would not entertain the idea of discussing certain ones with me. After we argued he told me he couldn't work with me anymore and transferred me to a different Pysch in the building. Another 2 months of BS and appointment switches I've finally got an appointment with the psychiatrist I want - one that will listen to me. I'd like to have as many facts as possible when I walk in there tomorrow morning. 

 I know certain meds don't work for certain people, Wellbutrin has done next to nothing for me. That is why I want to hear first hand stories from you all. Thanks in advance.",2

[VENT],"**Most** of the time I don't even think about using anymore but when it does cross my mind, the thought still makes my heart skip a beat like I'm on my way to see a long lost lover. For the past 2 years +, I've been in a position where I haven't been able to use... My life isn't the best, and as that certain day creeps up my anxiety heightens. It would be so much easier to just get high again I feel like, just one last taste. One last day to kiss my sorrows away. Maybe just a few puffs, a tidy habit... to get skinny and beautiful again instead of spending thousands of dollars on surgery then I'll sober up again. I miss the way it burned my nose on the way up, and tears well up in my eyes and slowly go away as the edges of my brain feel fuzzy. Or how when I hot-rail/smoke it, it'd be like icicles electrocuting from my lungs out to every tip of my body. I miss the way I could stare at myself in the mirror for hours, admiring myself. Sober, I'm not in the slightest narcissistic. I miss who I was on meth. The life of the party, free, beautiful... I was the best at sex then, now I rarely ever wanna do anything... **Most** days I'm proud of being sober for so long, it's a breeze and I don't struggle but when I sit and think about it for a moment, my heart shudders. It's been over 2 years but there's still times I obsess over it. I remember the day I quit, clearly. I was exhausted, days away from dying. 72lbs and 5'5"". I knew it was time, I got arrested that day even. But if I knew my time was done years ago, why do I still want it? Why do I feel like my life is over and I **NEED** it when I have so many goals and dreams, I wish to achieve that I never could with dinner plate pupils? I hate that I'm stuck right now, with no idea where my future may lead me. Some days I wish I could just get high on crystal one last time and then die. At least I'd be happy. I know I've ""come so far"", but it doesn't really feel it when my sobriety was basically forced rather than doing it on my own. I feel so lame now. I dedicated the majority of my teenage years to drugs/sex that now I don't know much else. I don't have any friends, the only people that I have in my life just want to get into my pants but I don't have the energy for it anymore. I'm only 18 but I have nothing to live for. Did meth really ruin my life? or was it the only thing that made it any fun or worth living? This is so ridiculous..  all this over seeing someone doing a hot rail in my feed. Oh god, how the fuck am I going to survive once I'm free to roam and do whatever? I hate that I just eat, I've gained a hundred pounds since I've gotten clean. ONE FUCKING HUNDRED! The stretch marks just keep seeming to appear everywhere. This triggers almost instantly every time I take a moment to look at it, that I had such an amazing body when I was skinny. Maybe I was too skinny, but I still had an ass thru it all. No stretch marks, I was in a shitty place but at least with an chemical induced smile on my face. Now I don't even have one of those kind of smiles. I was creative on meth, I could write and draw beautifully.. things I could never come up with now. I couldn't stand not having a pen and paper in my hand, and now I have to force myself to do anything of the sorts. I don't understand why I still don't have energy to do anything, I thought that it came back with sobriety time. I'm so sick of this hate/love relationship with meth. 

For those who are trying to quit and read this, please know that most of the time, I am happy I quit but there just the occasional time things get overwhelming. I'm on house arrest for a murder I didn't commit, and the trial is coming up. Everybody who was once my friend talks shit about me, I lost everyone because of rumors and hearsay. My lawyer is very confident I will win my case, because like I said - I didn't even do it so there's next to no evidence but statements from people that hate me. I'm just so sick of living this nightmare. I just wish with all my heart I could go back in time and rewrite the past. When I look back, I know I hated my time addicted to meth but at the same time that was my last opportunity to freedom. That was the last time I remember being truly free and happy. Meth is my association to happiness and it's the worst feeling ever.",8

Finally began to feel some depression creep in which may have been part of the reason I was drawn to this drug in the first place. I was at a point where I could either find my own prescription and continue down the rabbit hole, or face my demons. Here we are. 



Since quitting I’ve felt a major lack of motivation, increased anxiety, and socializing is much more of a chore. I was at a small gathering last night and I just felt so uncomfortable. For starters I already feel like a bit of a wet rag these days without many opinions or things to contribute to a conversation. At times like these I find I’m residing deep within my own head, over analyzing everything etc. 



Historically I’ve had a very high libido. Sex was one of my favorite activities. There was one night last year where my ex and I stayed up all night fucking on adderall. Otherwise, my sexual encounters would usually happen far later in the day after taking my dose. 




Last night this girl practically threw herself at me, and made all of the moves. I thought I’d go along with it and try to enjoy it, but I found myself very detached and anxious. I gave her head and eventually got a hard on but wasn’t able to finish. I hardly ever get morning wood or aroused at all besides when I masturbate a few times a week. 



I think this could be due to PAWS or maybe just attributed to my depressive / anxious state in general but nonetheless it’s been very disheartening and it’s hard to feel like “myself” when that sort of vitality I used to possess is gone (for now). Just wanted to share my experience and see if anybody has gone through something similar. 



Either way, still no adderall for me.",18

After a nearly 15 year addiction, I have been free for over a year. And I am so fucking happy. I have money, I'm in a new (and healthy) relationship, I have a new job that I love, I'm in grad school and have been getting straight As the entire time (all without drugs).

I'm so grateful for this community. I haven't visited in many months but I wanted to stop by and say that it is worth it. I know that everyone has vastly different lives and struggles but my god, anything is better than the hell of addiction. I never thought I could make it. It just felt like something I had to do for the rest of my life. But I was wrong. So wrong. 

Here's a poem that really resonates with me right now, and that I hope you find inspiration in:

There is freedom waiting for you

On the breezes of the sky 

And you ask, ""But what if I fall?""

Oh but my darling

What if you fly?

Two months of derealization followed by 10s focus span and extreme mood swings. Everything was gray and uninteresting. My thinking was so slowed down that videos and people talking seemed x2 sped up. Word recall was also slow. I was unable to follow basic conversations. This started 2 weeks after binge.

My thinking is fine now and i can talk without pauses for fetching commong words. Mood swings are mostly gone.

I was stuck in lala land for a long time and still am to an extent.

Taking nac and magnezium supplements.

My current problem is that im so ""not present"". I just cant push myself to care. Almost nothing excites me. I am ""not present"" and everything is falling apart arround me. I still feel mentally slower when it comes to maths and coding and cant bring myself to give any fuck. Solving problems used to be fun.

I did god damn ecstasy 3 times this year and took about 5 grams of street speed paste. Im preety sure i got addicted since i took a bit every day for 25 days.
It was ""its not neurotoxic im in control delusion"".

They said “it’s like a nice warm/numb feeling, it’s the best feeling ever, idk how to explain it really”  but now if someone were to ever ask me what it’s like, I would tell them.. 

”Its like spending every single penny you ever had, on drugs. 
Its like going days without eating even if you were starving, but you needed the withdrawals to stop. 
Its like having to lie to every family member and friend youve ever had. 
It’s like lighting a whole pack of cigarettes and never smoking one. 
Its like waking up hating yourself from the shame and guilt. 
Its like going into withdrawals every 8 hours unless you had more dope to do.
Its like never attending any family event because you needed to get high. 
Its like everyone eventually stopped inviting you anywhere or talking to you. 
Its like everything was on your drug dealers time. If they said a hour. You’ll wait 5 hours or more.
It’s like being late to every single day of your life even if you started getting ready long before you were supposed to be somewhere.
Its like losing so much weight you can’t fit into any of your clothes. 
Its like losing everything you’ve ever owned in your entire life. 
Its like nobody believing a word you said, even if it was the truth. 
Its like being a prisoner inside your own head. 
Its like contemplating suicide every single day. Its like never being scared to die, because that’s what you wanted. 
Its like trying to shut your brain up for even five minutes. It was worth that little time of peace. 
Its like seeing your family beg to spend time with you only for you to leave and go get high. Because stopping wasn’t an option. 
Its like you’d do anything for more.
It’s like talking in circles for hours about absolutely nothing.
It’s like losing days,weeks,months, years off your life and not even realizing it happened.
It’s like going inside places you’d never go before you did meth.
Its like everyone hating you no matter where you went, because they knew you were a drug addict.
It’s like thinking everyone is out to get you and people can read your every thought.
Its like walking into treatment 100 pounds with the clothes on your back and being scared to death. 
Its like giving your entire life away..”

When I was a heavy coke user, me and this girl would use it together. With coke being a ""ritualistic"" drug, when I was an active user and I knew I'd be doing coke on that night, in the couple hours before starting it, my body would do certain things and behave in certain ways. My body and mind would ""prepare"" for using coke; I would be completely psyched up and my heart racing, for the drug; I would be extremely aroused as we had violent, aggressive sex together on the drug; I was unable to control my bladder because of being so excited; I would struggle to form proper sentences as my brain was too hyper-active; my nose would be overwhelmed by the smell of cocaine.

All these effects occurred while I was under the influence, and they also occurred in the build-up to using coke with her. 

On Saturday, I spent some time with her, and all of these effects happened again. From about 1 hour before seeing her, I had a really strong smell of coke in my nose that I couldn't get rid of. I was ""coke-aroused"". My heart was pounding, my bodily functions were like they were on coke, I couldn't think normally, and I was sweating a lot. 

I have spent plenty of time with her since I stopped using, and none of this happened before. But this time it was like my body demanded coke and expected coke, in exactly the same way that I used to use it.

I just don't understand how I can still be having these 'withdrawals' an entire year later. Has anyone else experienced this sort of thing? And can you offer any advice?

For the most part, although I still think about coke and still have coke dreams, I'm able to compartmentalize it and I accept that I won't use it, much as I would like to. I was discharged from the drug clinic a few months ago as they said I no longer required help to stay clean.

Thanks, and any advice would be fab. <3",19

2020-11-18 10:15:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/jwhjt9/adderall_is_back_a_rant/,Adderall is back. A rant,"My posts started here nearly a year ago when my adderall addiction became out of hand. One day I’ll make a post about the progression but I ended up take 200-300ng of IR a day. Then taking Klonapin, Valium whatever the f I could to come down. I was in survival mode and i was miserable.

I got stuck in Australia during corona and i was forced off it -no choice. Ever try coming off of 300mg daily to going cold turkey - whilst also popping Valium and klonopin and some other random anti anxiety and anti depressant (which i was only talking bc i thought it would give me more serotonin and the adderalll would work more ha).

Anyway got stuck in Australia bc of COVID. Came here high af to visit a boy i met on vacation for the two weeks i was off adderall. I was unwell and 114lbs faking 300mg addy daily. Why i thought i could handle who knows (my school counselor legit said I’m scared for u and i was like i don’t cate about anything anymore). Me and my boy fought so i hopped on a plane to another part of Australia with 3 days of being away and I was away popping my limited addys because i was only supposed to be here 2 weeks so only brought like 60 (saying that out loud is ridiculous 60 30mg pills for two weeks wtf) . Really knew i had an issue when wasn’t taking them to study but just to legit move at this point.

I couldn’t function/!;  i ended up in a hostel private room taking lods of addy but unable to do ANYTHING for my classes online back home. I was there two weeks when i finally crashed and couldn’t move my uncle said “what have u been doing for two weeks?” I couldn’t tell u bc i did no school and no work- none. I don’t know what the fuck i did for 14 days mostly awake. The addy feeling would get me sorry high but i couldn’t go ANYTHING. My high was clear and i was okay when I up ish but clearly frantic from the outside anyone who looked at me (deadass a random airport security guy told me my eyes told a sad story lol ok). When i ran of my addy officially. I lost it. I can’t even describe i couldn’t life my arm up..i had ZERO energy. I can’t describe it. 

I had no one to call bc i lost my friends who never dealt with addiction before and no one understand. I called my mom and she just cried for me so scared i was there alone in the pandemic begging me to come back but I just didn’t want to. I didn’t want to succeed in school for the first time ever. I said fuck it. I slept three days straight after that and then one the fourth i went downstairs and i met these girls who said wanna go on a hike. They saved me and had no idea. I was so tired but i pushed through this hike and then slept for 2 days after. But i started to come out of it. I took a 5 question stupid quiz and it took me HOURS but i did it. I was heavy breathing trying to think. 23 years of pure self discipline down the drawn with adderall. 

I got lucky my grad school in America got moved to all online bc i was able to BS it all and pass unbelievably bc professor so lenient - what better time to have a mental breakdown. I didn’t take adderall for three months and i was the happiest i ever was. It wasn’t fake happy it was free happy i loved life again and it radiates off of me

Still needed to finish my MPH tho bc i didn’t go through the torture for nothing. Schools much easier here than in Australia so i transferred. But i still didn’t have capability to do the research work without my beloved addy. I paid thousands to get it shipped from America. I said I’ll take one two max and suddenly i was at 150mg. What the Fuck. I felt myself shaking as i was trying to get more and take it. I looked up and was like ur a fu Kong addict but i continued.

I pulled about 4 of these all nights all semester and do ALL the work for the whole semester in them. It blew but i did a bender of 2-3 days awake then would
Recover after a week but my happiness I gained back was gone and my dersasive thoughts intrusive: what the fuck am i doing in Australia where i got a chance to restart. 

However now i have two jobs and school (why the fuck do i do this to myself) and the addy is back. Addy is impossible to get here. Impossible. But i booked a psychiatrist appointment when i got here in March and the waitlist only got me in to see hi six months later.: i went in going to after my adderalll prescription but ended up hinting of my problems. He still prescribed me dexamaphamines bc i am unable to do work without it but they’re ducking me again. Now I’m taking everyday and not sleeping and I’m fucked.

I just took 30 mg of Valium and nothing. How the f do sleep. I take my goddamn vitamins like u wouldn’t believe and i hydrate. I’m fucking master of public health for crying out yet i have this issue and i can’t stop. When I’m up it’s so good and when I’m down I’m like chill the fuck out I’m so embarrassed at what i email like it must be so obvious this girl is out of her mind.

The sad thing is i lost so much weight i loved myself again i went from 140 to 114 where 114 too low but the 125 stage was beautiful. I’m back up to 145 and i can’t help but thing maybe I’ll pursue this addiction for the weight loss ...how fucked, but i notice the changes in my personality. I’m not me. My boufriend here is noticing it and this is how it all started last year

I though i recovered but i didn’t. I just simply didn’t have access and wasn’t doing any work..my work was self improvement and I loved it. I didn’t crave addy like I do all now. I always find an excuse for my pill. I just wish i would hide it from my boufriend but now my comedowns are so bad an im so flat i can’t. Oh and I. any talk to any friends or family at home bc when i left i was a train wreck about to be admitted into rehab so i can’t have them worry. 

Tho i really think if i could mf slee it would help bc when i don’t sleep i take more just to feel okay. 

Also literally reminded how much adderall makes u care so much about stupid details. I spent 3 hours designed chart colors. THATS NO OKAY FUCK ME. Ugh. 

I can’t get to as bad as i was at the estate of the year
..i can’t . Worse bc my boufriend lives with me I’m paranoid of contact judgement. At least in America i could hide in my room and be high. Now i always have to face someone.

I just feel so sad bc i had a taste of how amazing life could be without it again and now I’m back here and almost have this mindset I’m okay with being an addict again bc i feel like shift and i just pop another but what the fuck why. And then these comedowns man i swear they get worse and worse. 

I tried doing one dose of 25mg and still had wretched anxiety and depression and sleep issues . I used to be okay with 25mg and could sleep. Now my brain so so fucked i can’t. I’m really at a loss and just feel like survival mode all over again.",11

The thing is, I literally think about smoking again all the time even though I know if I use again, I will be kicked out of my house and homeless. I’m just really feeling hopeless that I completely fucked myself by reminding myself how much I love smoking meth. 4 years ago it completely destroyed my life, so I’m not so delusional that I think this time will be any different; I just literally cannot stop thinking about it.

Some backstory is I am a college student and been using Adderall (IR) to get by school and just graduate. 

I've been struggling with Adderall (IR) and can say I became dependent and abused this drug. Recent weeks I would take it daily around 60 MG and just recent would take 90 MG for about 4-5 days straight.

However this past two weeks I am able to take 3 consecutive day breaks from using it, but then after I resort to using 90 MG again after my 3 day break. Does anyone have or had experience with this?

2020-11-17 13:26:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/jvybec/weight_loss_in_sobriety/,Weight loss in sobriety!,"Hi community!

I recently put down the pipe after 6.5 years of daily smoking. 

Towards the end of my use, I was convinced I had a tumor somewhere in the center of my abdomen, or a swollen liver or parasites or something. 

I went to my primary doc and all my bloodwork (CBC) and an ultrasound came back clear. My doctor proudly diagnosed me as “You have fat!” And I probably do. 

Naturally, after getting clean I’ve adopted a routine of eating everything constantly at all times, and eating while thinking about what to eat next. 

But even when on dope I had a super swollen abdomen so who knows. 

I’ve dedicated to staying clean and I love it and I’m not looking back, but it would help to fit in something besides my pajama pants. 

So I guess I’m wondering what, if anything, has helped someone in a similar position - readjusting to how to eat (since it’s been 6 years since I ever had to think about it). And less so if anyone has anything to add to the lingering suspicion that my stomach was bloated for a medical reason, starting while I was still using. 

Wishing health and happiness to everyone.",10

I need days off to eat and sleep properly, for the sake of my health. My dose is either 30 or 40mg depending on the urgency of work that day.

I hate the side effects and have no real urge to abuse it, except I have binged a handful of times only for school emergencies, e.g., massive projects which I had procrastinated until the night before.

I feel dependant on this drug, but I am also quite confident that I have ADHD.

I don't want to be dependant on a drug forever, but I also genuinely question whether I can ever function as a remotely responsible adult without it. At the very least, I don't know if I can pass school without it.

From what I understand, this subreddit is about stopping stimulant addiction/abuse, and cutting out stimulants to prevent this issue. But what about therapeutic use that follows the label? Is this drug safe when taken in this way, or am I still hurting myself in the long run, albeit, in a more subtle way?

My friend, who has ADHD and is also prescribed Vyvanse, said he believes it causes damage to dopamine receptors even when taken according to the label. This kind of stuff has me worried.

I hope this post is okay for this subreddit and does not break any rules.

Earlier this year I seemed to be doing really well and even went a month without using at all, I would only use one or twice a month as opposed to using them daily like I used to.

But then I had a very nasty falling out with my best friend during which he repeatedly called me a 'reckless, destructive nihilist' for breaking lockdown to take drugs and he blocked me on everything. I don't think he's coming back, but i talked to him every day and he knew almost everything about me. It turns out the only reason I was almsost getting sober was because of him - i dont know how to do it for myself.

Being sober seemed unbearable so I very quickly returned to taking four grams speed and tramadol at the same time, I was awake for about four days and by the end I was fully delirious and psychotic. I fell asleep and decided maybe to try and stay sober, but then these unbearable feelings of loss and hurt came back and I returned - another four day binge. Starting with one gram of speed and some dexi-amphet.

This time I ended up going to a friends house because we thought we were going to have a ''sober night'' with a few drinks but i'm ashamed to say I bought another gram of speed anyway simply because I wanted to stay awake. Plus her flatmate bought some ketamine and we ended up doing that. I showed up to her house completely unwashed and unshaved because I was so high on speed whilst at home that I couldn't force myself to wash. It's hard to describe but when im on speed I just sit and focus on one thing and its hard for me to break out of that.

All her friends had been informed I had a speed problem and kept commenting on how long I'd been up, I overhearrd some of them saying I was ''acting like a tweaker''. After evveryone went to bed I continued staying up and doing speed, someone woke up and saw me and I was so ashamed of myself I cried. I can't bare to even talk to my friends right now, I feel like they all seem me as some worthless addict

I would get more but I dont have any money now and I think my dealer is getting concerned. I don't knwo what im going to do for the next few days anons. I knocked myself out with valiums for a few days but now Ive ran out, now im stuck having to face reality alone or try to beg my friends for money.

I sit there at work trying to get started and then anxiety sets in when I think about all the work I have to complete and how I can’t even get myself to start. Then I can’t concentrate or remember anything once I do get started, which ends up taking me 5x longer to finish one assessment and this is when I decide I need the adderall.

2020-11-14 21:24:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/jueava/super_motivated_to_get_sober_precovid_now_not_so/,"Super Motivated to Get Sober Pre-COVID, Now Not So Much","I had been using Adderall on and off for the last ten years, but the last three years it got really bad. Last October,  I made the decision to quit. I was done. I felt miserable and like my life was a wreck. I found a really good therapist who specialized in substance abuse; she is expensive but I made the financial commitment. I was so done last October. Something in me just snapped and I couldn't do it anymore. When I got sober, I started making more money, I looked better, and began running. Did my first 5K in March.

&#x200B;

 Then COVID hit. At first I was OK but after a few months I started to realize COVID was not just a short-term thing. I live in one of the hardest hit areas and my job & income were drastically reduced. I became pretty depressed and angry that I had to get sober right when COVID was developing. I kept thinking, I can't believe I got sober for this. I was sober 10.5 months  when I started using Adderall again. I have been starting and stopping using it for the past 2 months. I am quitting again tomorrow (still seeing my therapist thank goodness) but I don't feel that magic urge to quit that I felt last October. 

&#x200B;

I know I need to stop using but I don't feel the same motivation coupled with despair that I did last October. I think a lot of my ambivalence has to do with COVID and the uncertainty surrounding when life and my job can go back to normal. I truly believe that if COVID had not happened I would have stayed sober. I was SO motivated to get sober last October and truly changed my life around. It was just a breaking point for me and I don't feel that way now, even though I know I need to stop using.

&#x200B;

Has anyone else experienced this kind of super-charged urge to get sober, where you change everything in your life and don't look back? And is it possible for me to stay sober without that same urge or do I have to wait for some sort of magic breaking point again?",8

Clean. Had couple relapses after first post. Cold turkey didn’t work given amount of pills I was banging. Reduced over a week to 2-3 pills per day, then pulled the plug.

First 2 weeks hard.

Also had bout of combined bacterial tonsillitis and glandular fever - recovered almost fully now.

My head is clear and clearing even more. Delusions, psychotic symptoms no longer.

Everything I was as an individual is coming back. Self-esteem, confidence, clear views and approaches.

Interviews for jobs on the way. Social being rebuilt.

I’m feeling great.

Go for it guys, if a dickhead like me can do it, you can too.

And yes, I could go and pick up my usual prescription of 300+ pills at any point tomorrow. Just like I could have for past 2 weeks.

No need - there’s bigger and better things to do with my life.

Love and strength,

Now, I’m not willing to relapse just to improve my sex life but I figured I would vent on here about it because it still feels like a low blow. I like being sober and I know it is worth it in the long run but damn do I feel sexual activities are a little boring now...

2020-11-10 14:35:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/jrrs5m/if_im_not_speeding_i_fall_into_other_addictions/,"If I'm not speeding, I fall into other addictions","I've been clean for a bit longer than 5 months now, although I had a relapse 2 weeks ago. Small one, no all nighters spread out over 3 days. 

Without speed, I seem to gravitate towards other addictions. Fast food, weed, alcohol, benzos, Reddit, YouTube, and of course other drugs. I'm not proud of this, but yesterday for example I ended up doing about 300mg of MDMA. Nothing wrong with that necessarily, but just 7 days ago I also did MDMA. 500mg in one night. I've been using MDMA responsibly for the last 5 years with appropriate breaks and doses, and I know how neurotoxic it is. But in that moment, when the boredom hits and I'm feeling restless, it's like something takes over. My gut is screaming at me, telling me that it's a bad idea and I go back and forth if I should do it or not. Unfortunately it usually ends up with me saying fuck it, why not. 

If I buy ketamine, the baggie is usually empty by the time the sun sets. If I got any other random drug, I'll probably take that instead. If I got benzos, I'll dose every night so I don't have to toss and turn. I'll order large pizzas not because I'm hungry, but because it scratches a certain itch. And if there's no drugs, I run down to the store to buy myself a six pack of beer. Oh and of course, weed every single day. 

The other day I was seriously considering to buy Oxycontin even though I know how addictive shit like that is. I've had fentanyl IV at the hospital and I remember telling myself I shall NEVER buy any opiate/opioid because that shit was way too fucking good. But yeah, I'm more open to it now despite my better judgement. 

The reality is: I don't know how to spend my time without escapism. Everything feels like too much effort so I just go for the easiest, most gratifying solution in the moment. Even though it usually ends up with me feeling bad.

THAT is what I miss about speed. With speed, everything was satisfying. That way I could actually work on shit I actually cared about. Explore my hobbies. Without it, I feel like a mess who can't put their mind into anything for more than seconds at the time. Let's not forget how much cheaper it is compared to what I'm doing now too. Sometimes, I wonder if it's actually better for me to use speed than what I'm doing now.

I don't know, guys. Sure, there has been some positives about quitting. I've opened up more socially, although I still feel lonely. I lift weights three times a week and I've made decent progress. Sure feels good to look at myself in the mirror to see all that hard work pay off. But that's all. I haven't made progress in other areas of my life. In fact, I feel like I've regressed in a lot of ways. It feels like speed made it possible to to do more ""heavy"" work in regards to using your brain. Like programming, which I enjoy but feel like I can't do without speed. 

Then there's of course what this post is all about... Speed keeps me away from all these other addictions. It's getting harder and harder to keep telling myself that not using speed is the better option. I've been diagnosed with ADHD too so it feels like I'm doomed to this vicious cycle of seeking out instant gratification. Of all the things I've done and tried in my life, only speed has made it possible for me to dedicate myself. And I miss that. A lot.

Just feeling a bit hopeless today. Drank three beers while writing this post. I'm sure there's someone out there who can relate. I hope this gets better because I'm nearing a point where I don't see any reason not to take speed. Truth to be told, I'm actively trying to get my prescription back.",15

He called me a loser, said the most hateful things to me. I pleaded with him to work things out but he said I was the reason him and my mum argue and if I was not around there would not be an issue.

My mum is caught up in the middle and she is the last person who cares about me. I am now at a dodgy backpackers with my life in tatters. All I want is to be happy again and compartmentalise the betrayal I have felt. I would have done anything for him but he has just made things so awful.

My whole future is now at risk & I do not know how to handle it.If it was not for my mum then I would either be straight back on the gear or checking out permanently.

Sleeping is the only peace I get & when I wake up, there is this soul crushing despair about my life.I did the right thing, I admitted I had a problem, I allowed myself to be completely vulnerable & instead of protecting and helping me, he has used this time to kick me while I am down.

&#x200B;

I would have done anything for him & now that love has turned to hatred that he could do this to me.I feel trapped because I love him so much but after what he has done and the things he has said, I think permanent damage has been caused and it feels like someone has died.

I think even if he was to admit he was wrong, and as much as I want him in my life, I do not think he deserves to be forgiven.

Do you think anti depressants might help me through this time and avoid a relapse on meth.Meth makes me happy and it removes negative emotion, how to anti depressants compare & can I stay on them without any adverse effects?

I really am at the lowest point of my life.",5

I was going days without sleep, not doing my work, self loathing, family problems, the works. Now I never really think about them and it makes me feel really good. When friends start to describe how they feel on them I still get kinda fiendy but Im not pressured to take any. Im just so glad I left and have control over my life again. Keep it real, and stay safe ✌️",5

Writing things out here because someone in the future might be comforted by it and I want to be able to come back to this for myself too. 

The first time I did meth I was around 17 and did it with a sexual partner. 
Shortly after that I met up with another guy and had a 12 hour long binge that ended in me getting insanely sick and having my first crash that I did not handle well. 

Then I went to college and these 16 hour sex/meth binges started happening more. It became a pattern once every few months. I would go to meet up with someone, sometimes even subconsciously seek it out, go smoke, do some unholy things, and then live in a shame spiral for 3 months. Rinse and repeat. 
But I never let myself buy my own because I knew I would be done in. I forced myself to keep it as a thrilling, “every once in a while” thing that I could only access via hooking up with guys that had it. But I noticed myself normalizing it to myself. I’d make excuses why it wasn’t that serious and how I could use harm reduction practices to control how much damage I was doing/feeling. But like...what the fuck?

I hadn’t used since last winter. Graduated college, I was doing good.
But a few weeks ago I went to meet up with someone that I didn’t know had it, and was offered it. Aaaaand i ended up accepting. 

I hung out with them again last night and did the same thing and now I’m honestly just having a come to Jesus moment with myself. I almost made plans to chill with them again tonight and then realized I’m gonna blink and have my own bag and be wrapped up in some shit I can’t hold back on. 

I want to legitimately work on breaking this cycle and be free of this bullshit I’ve been doing. Kind of using this post as a way to remind myself next time I want to go get wrapped up in it that the will is there and I just need to keep my mind straight for a few hours whenever I feel that urge. It’s not even worth it. 

So yeah. 11/9/20 9am is my new date. Hoping to stick to it for a bit longer than the last one. Cheers.",18

2020-11-09 16:40:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/jr72aw/i_have_more_energy_than_i_ever_did_on_meth/,I have more energy than I ever did on meth,"Near 3 months in, one minor slip, my other posts are out there. It's been a wild ass ride. I've gone from complete imbecility and feared brain damage, to a point where right now I feel like I am so much closer than I ever have been to figuring out my life.

I legitimately have more energy than I ever did while taking meth. My focus is still terrible, but it's getting better every day.

I would like to share my secret because I feel everyone needs to know this, a lot of it is going to seem completely obvious. The only caveat I have to disclose is that I may be bipolar and slightly manic at the moment, but what I'm feeling right now has been sustained now for a few days and I'm going to continue to reinforce the fuck out of these behaviours, because I love how I feel right now and I've never felt this good before.

&#x200B;

1. Sleep. Wind down at night, turn on full comfort view to block all blue light if you must look at a screen, lately I've been laying down with a podcast and the lights off to wind down, but books are great too. Make sure your room is DARK. No lights, turn off your PC rgb's, you must be in darkness. When you wake up if you have no direct sunlight turn ALL your lights on.
2. Quit smoking. No seriously, quit smoking. I'm going to go out on a generous limb here and assume that pretty much all of you doing meth are also cigarette smokers. I was a pack a day. I'm on day 8 no smokes
3. Stop mouth breathing. I didn't know this but I've pretty much mostly mouth breathed since as long as I can remember. I grew up in a second hand smoke smoke-box and I more than likely developed a poor physiological response to being poisoned 24/7 since birth. Mouth breathing is HORRIBLE for you. Breathing is just as if not more important than food. If you don't breathe out of your nose there is a massive cascade of deleterious effects as a result. It's estimated upwards of 50% of the population are mouth breathers. Breathe from your nose and only your nose. Your mouth is for eating. Learn the Buteyko technique to clear your nose if it's too stuffy or hard to breathe - it sounds insane but it works amazingly well and involves nothing more than 15+ seconds of holding your breath and pinching your nose.
4. Vitamins. I take a basic multi and 5000 IU of vitamin D. Let's just say after 3/4 of a year locking myself in a basement and only coming out at night my system wasn't getting any vitamin D. Most people are severely deficient. I also take an omega 3-6-9 pill. Very very basic.
5. Basic exercise. Even if it's just walking. I'm working my way up to running, but I have very bad knees. Either way, if you're like me there's a good chance that even a solid hour of walking will tucker you out. Throw on a podcast and go walking. Lift some dumbbells if you got em. Just do something that makes you move.

Basically everything I've mentioned works together in some sort of symbioses. If you're sleeping better you're going to be more refreshed and have more energy. If youre breathing better you're going to have more energy, and you're going to sleep better, which in turn also gives you more energy. The vitamin D is actually not a vitamin but a fucking hormone and it's responsible and required for soooooooo many metabolic pathways.

&#x200B;

I wake up, eat a banana my vitamins and make up a coffee and wash up.. I don't even need the coffee I'm not even fucking kidding. I am bouncing off the walls, I feel like I've removed a massive weight from my shoulders. Music sounds fucking amazing and I'm sitting here vibing like someone on MDMA..

&#x200B;

But it's a clean energy. It's pure. I don't know how else to explain it.. there's no dirtyness. I feel incredible. I'm so much more rational and clear headed feeling too.. it's just it's fucking amazing. 

Give it a shot.",65

For me I had a spiritual awakening, I went to hospital, the police were called and now it's like I know something they don't want us to know, because our culture is geared around materialism, doing stims made me turn inward and this is the one time in my life did I see things clearly, now I have spiritual guide.",5

2020-11-08 22:26:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/jqpzsr/quitting_now_or_in_the_near_future_isnt_the/,"Quitting now, or in the near future, isn't the hardest part-- but I'm scared that in the long run, I will never be able to truly rid myself of my addiction.","Sorry for how lengthy this post is, I just feel like my usage patterns are so different from the usual that I felt the need to really elaborate on them.

So it’s been 3 days since I last did adderall. I’ve been using it for about a year and a half, starting at 15 mg. At first I was only using about once a week to once every two weeks. I’ve never binged on adderall and not slept overnight because of it, although it stays in my system for a long time so there have been times where I’ve ended up sleeping at 8 AM because it just took 15 hours for me to stop feeling it. I kinda became dependent on it for school, using it to catch up on studying for midterms or essays. Sometimes I’d end up taking 30 mg in the morning for the 3 days before my midterm and then I wouldn’t use it for a month until I had another big assignment. The thing is, after using it for 3 days in a row almost always I’d tell myself I was done with adderall and would quit. Somehow I’d always convince myself to change my mind a week before a new test or so.

Fast forwards to three weeks ago, I realized I had 3 huge essays due for school and just completely freaked out, as I was really behind on everything. I then proceeded to take 35 mgs one day, telling myself I’d take it every other day for about a week. I’d always tell myself that I’d “only do 20” or a small amount most of those days, but when the high kicked in I’d always end up taking more. Gradually, the “one week” turned itself to 3 weeks, where I worked my way up to 60 mgs. I did manage to only take the adderall every other day, but I did WAY more and for WAY longer than I intended to. Also want to mention that I’ve never snorted adderall or anything, just took the pills orally. I finally made myself stop 3 days ago once I hit 60 mg which I heard is the maximum prescribed dose for narcolepsy and it dawned on me that I was doing way too much.

Looking back at this whole situation, I’ve finally realized that my drug use is out of control and I’m really not in control of it— I’m an addict. Yesterday—2 days after my last dose— I started having the worst withdrawals I’ve ever had, which consisted of depression and anxiety. The anxiety part is what is messing with me the most— I’m just so scared of relapsing. I’m only 19 years old and have whatever amount of years of life ahead of me to potentilly relapse. I know that I won’t do adderall for a month or so— it’s not the immediate withdrawals that lead me to start using again. The problem is I ALWAYS think I finally quit and then somehow I end up convincing myself that it’s okay to begin using again. The only thing I want in the world is to make my decision FINAL and be assured that I will never just trivialize it and convince myself that it’s okay to do it again. The whole “take it day by day” shit doesn’t work, because I need to be able to make a decision that sticks, as the me making the decision today doesn’t know if in 3 months, I will make the decision to use again. Does anyone have any insight on how to make this happen? There’s a part of my brain telling me that if I QUIT quit, that down the line, maybe in 2 years, I’ll try it again, and spiral downward faster than I’ve ever done before— and that instead, I should just control it and take 10 mgs VERY occasionally, like maybe every 3 months or so.

Tl;Dr: Desperately need advice on long-term forms of quitting adderall for good, as I have no trouble quitting for periods but I always come back to it and each time it’s worse.",7

&#x200B;

It's so challenging having to deal with my underlying reading disability off adderall. 

&#x200B;

I don't even know where to begin. The learning disability resource center at my school has this app to read or convert text to audio (like in a siri voice) except since the textbook is not formatted to really be used for that, the app basically is interrupted every couple sentences by saying an error message every time it encounters an asterisks or footnotes or arrows or bullets.

i'm looking into different formats for students with disabilities that the publisher of the textbook might offer but everything is just an unreasonable amount of extra legwork. the publisher seems to perhaps have some tools but it's through yet another partnering platform that I need to get set up with first, and may not even be the platform used for my other textbooks. It doesn't recognize my registration key or code for having purchased the textbook so now i have to wait to hear back after emailing customer support.

&#x200B;

it's so frustrating. i feel like i'm just dealing with a lot of the limits of recovery right now....my underlying issues don't necessarily get fixed by the tools of recovery. and i feel like being anonymous about these things doesn't necessarily help.

Even WHILE I was under the influence of it 3 months ago, I still felt guilt for what I was doing knowing the consequences of what it was doing to me mentally.

Cravings can get bad sometimes but the thing I'm happy about now is that I don't feel like meth is in control anymore, I AM IN CONTROL NOW. It's important to realise how your cravings manifest themselves and realise that the urge does not last, it'll pass. Just breathe and tell those cravings to fuck off. The cravings hardly last any time at all now for me, they are way less mentally taxing and I can finally fucking focus on the important things in life. I'm happy to be alive.

In Australia the price of meth went from about $200-240 a gram, a price which had been pretty stable for at least 5 years to at the height of Covid-19 hitting $800 a gram.

I was getting sick a lot because I could no longer afford the amount I needed. Add to that the increased prices caused a rash of scamming on the darknet so the reality is if you count the losses I faced including one time getting rock salt & I just could not keep up the charade of being normal.

I ended up admitting to my parents that I was addicted and they helped me a lot. I think I am strong enough to never touch it again but Covid-19 definitely was the main factor in me giving up and getting square.

Anyone else here had the virus and the lockdowns that occurred to thank for their sobriety?",15

I consider that a huge achievement and something I am very proud of although I am a long way from the finish line.I am living in my parents granny flat (mini house seperated from the main house) and they have helped me out a lot, no denying that & I am thankful for it.

For 6 years I have kept my habit hidden from everyone, nobody ever knew so part of giving up was to be more transparent about my life. My mum said after the argument that there are just some things they do not want to know about. This to me is a completely confusing message & they also said they felt really humiliated by what I said after they had told everyone how good I had been doing. To be fair, my mum is a peacemaker so when my dad hit the roof, she just tries to say whatever she thinks will make the problem go away, I do not blame her at all.

The issue is that whenever a disagreement happens, it is brought up about how much I am being helped and that just feeds into low self esteem.

My Dad drinks and we only ever really have disagreements when he has drunk too much (Yet even though every major argument happened when he drank too much, it is not the alcohol) Also I am myself 46 so its not like I am a teenager. He has never been violent or anything like that but he does say pretty mean things which is the opposite of me, I never say something to someone unless I actually mean it.

Now Sunday we went to lunch & as is the case, the nastiness appears when I am sort of at my happiest which currently is not that often as anyone trying to give up meth can probably attest to.

I have said many times to my parents in the recent past that I will never touch meth again and it is a promise I intend to keep no matter how hard it gets but will likely at some point in the future probably have psychedelics again. I do not feel like them now and it may well be years if ever that I feel in a good place where I feel comfortable taking them (DMT/LSD or Mushrooms)

I rarely drink and decided to have a couple & of course, my guard lowers, I am a happy drinker and maybe am more open when I have had some drinks. The topic somehow came up and I said that I probably will have LSD again at some point.

My dad said in front of non family people & in a crowded public place that he thought I was a loser, pathetic among many other things however they were the most hurtful.We had a massive argument in the car where I tried to calm things down but once he gets to that point, he just spews out hate.

We have not spoken since. He tends to re write history so that somehow his terrible behaviour somehow becomes we were all a little bit wrong and then a month later the same thing happens.

I am starting to lose respect for someone I care a lot about. Why are some people so hurtful to the people they are supposed to love and care about?The only reason I have stayed is because my mum is caught in the middle and I do not want her to be hurt any more. I would rather live in a car park and pick food out of rubbish bins than be put through that regularly.

I do not know how to handle the situation, I mean I am still at my weakest & it gets to me that every time an unrelated disagreement is brought up, how much I am being helped out is the first thing mentioned & he always tells me I am the one getting between him and my mum yet I disagree with that. I just think if you disagree with someone, you stick with the disagreement at hand & do not personally attack the other person & you do not blame them for every related thing that may be going wrong with your own life.

I love him to death but I do not like being treated so badly & do not know what the right move is.He is great 95% of the time and then his mean streak comes from nowhere. It used to be the 95% was worth putting up with the 5% but I am not so sure anymore.",4

I don’t see how people can be so hateful and coldhearted though. I’m so upset and depressed that I can’t manage to stay off this garbage for more than a couple of days. I have a couple of good offers but I won’t pass the required drug test. So I spent my last money on a ball  and Ive been getting my things packed and moved all by myself. Im smoking now. Haven’t slept in a couple days. I just cry and smoke and pack boxes. I’m put my things in storage and I’ll sleeping in my car that I barely have gas for. Im a woman in my 40’s. I used to be so strong and smart. I raised my 2 children on my own. I thought i was a good mother. I’m an embarrassment to them I guess now. I’m so sad and so scared. I wish I could just die.,48

I was wondering if anyone had this type of conversation with their doctor and how it plays out?  Are they generally receptive to the idea or want you to stay on something else?  I feel like my ADD diagnosis was false from the beginning because I clicked one box too many on the checklist and now I have an adderall addiction.  I just want to be off of this stuff but worry about how it then looks to  insurance, employers or anyone else who sees, ""Oh you had ADD but now you just don't take your meds for it?  Or you just don't have ADD all of a sudden.""  Not sure if anyone was ever in a similar position.",4

But I pledge to stay sober for today

I’ve been vaping (menthol) nicotine the past few weeks and yesterday and this morning noticing after I take a (what seems like big) pull, inhale, exhale, I’m tasting a familiar sort of ammonia but just sort of thick meth-y taste at the end. It’s happened multiple times. Not noticing on my cannabis vape, but also remember in the past when I’ve been off meth that I’ve tasted it when I’ve smoked thc and get too big of a hit and cough. Also I think I’ve noticed it when I’ve had a deep cough before. 

It’s only been four days since I last smoked even a tiny hit out of an old bowl but been a solid 10 days since I’ve had a more normal size meth sesh. I also noticed this in the past for up to maybe a month after.

Just curious, have any other current or former smokers noticed possible remnant tastes like that, when abstinent, or heard of such a thing?? Am I still trippin? Probably not too much consequence but wondering how long our bodies could be physically detoxing, on a significant level. Happy Sunday all.",5

My girlfriend is unaware of my recent daily use and we have had a few great months. I had 8 months clean after a year of random use up until a few months ago. I was drinking and snuck out and got a bag. Got away with it a couple times before my girl caught on and ended up relapsing with me that time. Weeks went by and she caught me the next time, and relapsed again w me. Then we both agreed we had to be done. She doesn’t want to do it but has trouble saying no when it’s around. I get caught up in it and seem to find a reason to keep going. 

A few weeks ago I snuck and got some more and when I told her she asked me to leave. I did and we have worked things out, but I’m back staying at my house now, and I ended up getting more on my own. Then after 2 days up I figured I needed a little more to get through the weekend. Last weekend it was her moms birthday party and I knew I didn’t want to crash, said to myself I would crash on Monday.. but I had a little left, which I did, and got more. Then it had been 5 or 6 days. I slept, ate, and told myself I was done. BUT I had a little left again.. so i ended up doing it and was up all night. Then we had Halloween plans with her kids this weekend and I didn’t want to crash so I got enough to get through this weekend and now here I am. With just a little left. Trying to get to sleep, telling myself I won’t do the rest. 

I’ve gotten stuck in this vicious cycle and want to stop. I know how it works.. I know I will need rest and nutrition, I know it will be hard. Oh, I may be starting a new job soon, so I need to get though this detox and get better, for myself, and to have a future. 

Any thoughts, advice, recommendations for movies to watch?

I enjoy watching music documentaries, conspiracy documentaries, music videos, drug movies, recovery stories etc to pass the time.

Thanks I’m advance. I appreciate you all!",1
