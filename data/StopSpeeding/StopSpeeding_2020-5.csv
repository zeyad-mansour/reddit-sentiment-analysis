I, like many people, got into adderall in college. It helped me focus to study, lose weight after gaining the freshman 30 (Whoops), made me social, and allowed me to keep drinking late into the night. Because of this, I ended up getting a prescription, took it for nearly two years, and abused it for probably a year or so of that time. I mean taking 4x my prescription (60-75 mg /day and snorting it regularly).

I stopped in October of 2017 because it completely changed me. I've always been anxious but this took my anxiety to the next level. I was weird and nervous and sweaty all the time and starting having episodes after heavy usage where I thought I was having a heart attack and would get extremely dizzy. 

I went to the hospital a few times during those episodes and they always said I was fine. Since then, 2.5 years after quitting, I still have extreme periods of dizziness (Think sitting on a rocking boat or tumbling around in the waves), have crazy social anxiety (My body heats up and I can't think straight), and trouble concentrating. Sometimes, I'll feel this way for days at a time. It's more than 50% of the month that I feel like absolute shit. 

I've asked EVERY doctor I've gone to (Cardiologist, neurologist, gyno, nurse friends, etc...) and had every test in the book completed and they all come back fine and tell me it's HIGHLY unlikely I've done permanent damage. 

My psychologist thinks it's anxiety and I think that's feasible - it could be my body's trained reaction to stress/stimulation - but I just can't let go of the idea that I've fucked myself permanently.

We were happily together in it, I was reminded why I had loved her so much. It felt so real that when I woke up I almost cried. Needless to say I've been in a melancholic and regretful mood all day. It's like my brain is trying to get me to use by triggering the emotions that drove me to drugs.

 I keep wishing I could go back in time to when I just started using and warn my younger self. Back then I had plenty of friends, I was always laughing and cracking jokes, a total goofball. Now I'm a hollow shell of what I once was,  I haven't genuinely laughed in years, only forced ones. My back hurts from spending 12 hours every night hunched over in a chair getting high. I'm 27 and feel like my life is over.

I can't bring myself to eat. Only sleep, going to bed hungry. This is only day 4 though so I just have to bide my time. The supplements came yesterday, I took them this morning and they had absolutely no effect. Oh well, I was hoping for an instant fix but maybe they just have to build up in the system.

To be honest with you guys I have a low dose script of Vyvanse waiting in the pharmacy for preapproval by my insurance. My plan was to give it to my mom to hold and stop by her place everyday for next morning's dose but now I'm not so sure about doing this. I really want to get to the point where I can laugh again, won't that just prolong it? And that's assuming that I take it as prescribed which isn't 100%. It's just that I legitimately have adhd and that makes everything worse. Even before I started abusing adderall my life was going nowhere. Maybe it's still to early to worry about this.

But still unemployed and kind of clueless :-(,"The depression still seems to gradually be softening. I don't notice the physical healing of my brain as much or as fast as early on (where each day I noticed improvement) but I still feel like if I look back to where I was 3-4 weeks ago, I recognize I am still physically improving. 

That said, wow, I still really struggle with the reading, writing, mental/cognitive, focus/ADHD issues that led me to being prescribed Adderall in the first place! 

But I was on it for about 10 years and I'd say 7 of those years was heavy overuse/abuse, so I have to look at not-even 5 months off of Adderall as basically being nothing. I've heard it can take 2 yrs give or take for your brain to heal. 

It's confusing though. As mentioned, I lost 60 pounds (diet and also walking a TON, maybe 3-6 hours a day during quarantine). Then given my major cognitive/ADHD symptoms struggles, sometimes I'm like ""hmmm, maybe I should become a personal trainer or a kids basketball coach!"" -- i.e. something polar opposite to the type of school work and job work I was pursuing before getting off Adderall.

I knew recovery would be like a totally different existence/reality, but it's confusing and hard to try and reinvent myself and my life accordingly, especially because without Adderall the best way for me to learn new things and achieve change is through social interaction and COVID makes that so limited still.

This has caused me to become paranoid and just worsen the cravings even more. I hate that I can only sleep for 2 hours and then wake up and sleep for 3 more MAX (average 5 hours a day) when I was used to sleeping 6-12 when I was an addict as meth actually kind of helped me sleep due to my ADHD

I won't let this deter me from the progress I've made such far and definitely know this is just a way for my addiction to meth to just get me to relapse once again.

Anyone deal with the same? And how did you deal with it? Even cannabis won't help and I've become fearful of falling asleep due to the fact of me thinking something will happen to me in my sleep and/or nightmare.

I started doing street speed for school, and as soon as I felt that sweet sweet dopamine release I couldn’t help myself and did decently strong doses daily for 3 weeks straight, with only one or two days break in total. Maintained regular sleep, ate and drank less than normal during that period but I’m eating and drinking fine now. 11 days ago, I was on the speed comedown when I smoked a fat bowl of weed and proceeded to have a panic attack which I thought was a seizure at the time. I thought my arm was swelling when it really wasn’t and my heart rate felt like it was through the roof, like 170 bpm. My left arm was numb and tingly and I thought my neck was spasming, but it’s hard to tell because of the comedown making me feel like crazy. Since then, I quit the drug completely and I’ve had 4 panic attacks since. Similar to the first time but not as severe. I’ve already make it past the acute depression as I am starting to enjoy life again but that first week was miserable. My concern is, my baseline anxiety is so much higher. I feel like I almost constantly have adrenaline in my legs and I get light headed very easily too. I never want to touch that drug again. 

The anxiety is really getting to me though as it doesn’t matter what I’m doing, it can get triggered for no reason and the panic attacks leave me feeling depressed and depleted for days after. Is this normal? It’s very scary and I am worried I’ve damaged myself. 

I’ve even quit weed this week because every time I smoke now I go into a panicky state. Even as we speak I am on the toilet because the adrenaline feeling in my body makes me want to shit haha. I even went to the doctor and got my blood and heart checked and everything came back fine. 

How long until I’ll go back to normal? I just want to proceed with life again as I’ve learned from this terrible mistake. I am now taking a low dose benzodiazepines every second day as the anxiety gets bad enough that I am scared I’ll go into another panic attack and have to suffer the days after too. Will this go away? I’ve never suffered from anxiety before amphetamines. It feels like that adrenaline rush you get on speed but I’m getting it in daily life and it’s not fun or pleasant in the slightest.

After take off, I felt a slight prick in my neck and about 15 minutes later, I was overcome with INTENSE emotions and I could not stop crying. The crying lead to a panic attack and I made my way to the bathroom. After about 20 minutes of hardcore crying, yelling out that I will never do drugs again, and realization of what I had done (my relapse), I manage to open the door to leave the bathroom. Upon leaving the bathroom i look at the attendant (or medical professional) and tell him that was the most intense thing I have endured, to which he responds ""uh, huh, you're CURED"". He was wearing some kind of t-shirt that had the word Recovery on it. 

After landing, I had a second wave of effects from the drug. I could absolutely not stop bawling my eyes out and feeling somewhat the same effects of Ecstacy minus the euphoria.

2020-05-17 15:58:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/glm639/what_substance_helped_you_quit/,What “substance” helped you quit?,"I know the general approach for quitting amphetamines is typically cognitive behavioral therapy. Since science has not been successful in over 30* years developing a proper pharmacotherapy I think it’s a cop-out to classify treatment as cognitive/mental based. 

At this point it seems obvious the cause of the addiction is epigenetic related mainly from the severe accumulation of overexpressed DeltafosB. With the knowledge science has showing how this addiction is epigenetic based I cannot see how they have any excuse at this point not to have a successful DeltafosB antagonist or at least a deltaJunD agonist which would act in the same way. 

With that being said I’m wondering who has used a particular drug, compound, substance, etc. to help with the tolerance and make it easier to taper off the drug and eventually quit? It seems like drugs science investigated as potential pharmacotherapies like wellbutrin and Modafinil worked mainly as DAT inhibitors and even showed some success towards Cocaine which shares more with inhibiting DAT as it’s main mechanism so I can see why that would make sense but what I cannot see is how they would not be successful for amphetamine as it too shares a strong inhibition for DAT with the main difference being at also has a strong releasing agent.

What’s troubling is,  it would be one thing if these DAT inhibitors(bupropion/Modafinil) simply didn’t help with amphetamine addiction but they not only don’t help, they actually dull and decrease the positive aspects of amphetamine like many of the wake enhancing properties and overall euphoric feeling. 

This makes absolutely zero sense and It appears those drugs might be beneficial when you have actually gone off of amphetamine and would be dealing with any type of withdrawal but I’m wondering if anyone has found anything successful to argument with amphetamine to make that process of actually getting off easier and more realistic? 

Besides the obvious of other stimulating agents to augment like caffeine and nicotine there seems to be nothing else helpful. Dopamine agonists do nothing which was surprising to learn and there are only a few nootropics that show synergy like oxiracetam and semax. Bpc-157 is hit and miss as some have stated they get the opposite goal which is rare but there has still been a few. 9-me-bc did nothing, Bromantane did nothing,etc..Very low dose opiate augmented showed some synergy but your just opening a new window of problems trying to go that route. Ibogain seems like it may show some promise but it’s not practical to fly somewhere for expensive therapy that takes weeks with no promise at all. Besides that I feel like I have tried everything except low dose Selegiline Which I’d like to hear more reviews on if anyone found success in that? 

Other than that, anyone who has beat this demon using a substance or compound or whatever to augment with I’d like to hear your success? Thanks!

P.S. A lot of people who have not dealt with this addiction seem to go with the mainstream approach thinking it’s not that hard you just sleep it off but it’s not fair to compare unless you have actually gone through it. The only reason why mainstream states that it’s ok to quit cold turkey and rehab does not have any medical approaches and typically we just have you stay for a few days is because it’s an addiction that doesn’t cause a risk of death (via seizure) when abruptly stopping like opiates and benzodiazepines. The simple reason of not dying when stopping is not justified to neglect pretty much all pharmacotherapy. That only has to do with FDA/Gov liability reasons which is obvious why they still prescribe it like candy knowing of the severe addictions just like they did with opiates. It’s obviously financial based to continue prescribing knowing of the addictive properties and low risk of death through seizure.",11,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6224362}"

I’ve been a heavy mephedrone user for around a year, previously only having consumed pre-ban many years ago. Honestly, the quantities I can get through scares me. Tonight was my worst, and had the worst outcome.

I hide my use from my girlfriend, she doesn’t know. To get around this, I stay in a hotel room around once a week and tell her I’m working a night shift. If she’s at work and I’m off, I’ll use.
I’m a shitty person and hate myself.

I consumed 13+ grams in less than 2 days (all intraNaselly), and this is a highly potent batch. My nose and areas around look awful. Seriously.

Things were going quite well! I was kind of enjoying myself. During the second night, I heard some noises coming from outside. It sounded like people were throwing stones at the hotel windows. This building has a reception down the road, so no staff are here. I thought I heard a window smash and someone shout, I guess this didn’t happen. I even recorded what I could (it was dark..), and they even said “he’s filming us”, but I couldn’t see anything due to the darkness.

After this, the hotel room next door (they’re paired basically) started being really noisy. Like obnoxiously noisy. Banging things around on purpose, music ridiculously loud etc. Every time I blew my nose, they would play the same song really loudly. And every time my bathroom dripped (the ceiling had a small leak, wasn’t a big issue) they would make even more noise, like they thought I was doing it on purpose.

Next, they kept playing this song which I couldn’t make out too well, but was saying “someones gonna die, we’re gonna kill you” or something. I just thought they were trying to scare me. Then I heard him calling upstairs, and someone was moving about up there. Next I heard a gun being loaded. I literally thought I was going to be murdered. Before the phone call, I was texting the manager, asking him if I could have an escort when I leave in the morning. He said it would be silly but I can come to reception now. I was too scared too, and I told him.

He turns up a few minutes later, and I’m packing my stuff as quickly and quietly as I could. He knocks at my door and I open, he asks who the troublemakers were. I just kept whispering that I just want to go, let me be safe first. When I said it was next door, it turns out it was the security office, with the security guard in there. I realise I must look crazy - sleep deprived, really inflamed nose, talking like a mad man. I tried to turn it around to the people throwing rocks outside, and he said it was impossible and he had already checked the cctv for the neighbours and no one else was there.

As he left, he said to take an ambien and get some rest, it was probably just a bad dream. I feel so stupid. As soon as he said it was a security guard next door I realised it was just in my head. Nothing like this has ever happened before, and won’t again. I’m going to flush what I have left, because I really can’t risk this happening again, and also I’m just on a completely downward slope as it is. I’m just grateful that I didn’t call the police when I feared for my life (I was close to), and also that the manager didn’t call an ambulance or something.

Sorry for the long post! It was more so I can remember it in the future, but maybe someone will find it mildly entertaining?

It’s 4.20am now, and my first recording was around midnight, and the manager turned up at 3.40am.. just for rough timescales!",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7236402}"

I was prescribed amphetamines for ADD four years ago, first Vyvanse, then Adderall (20mg) for the last two years after my new insurance didn't want to cover Vyvanse.

I've been seriously considering discontinuing ever since making the switch, for several reasons-- not liking the side effects, not being in grad school and needing it as much as I used to, and disliking being dependent on it and scheduling life and travel plans around making sure I can get it filled on time.  When I made the switch, doctor and insurance nightmares meant I was without either drug for a month and I had miserable withdrawal.

Because of COVID 19, the system has changed for my refills and now my doctor is almost a week late getting it refilled.  I don't want to go through this cycle ever again, and I figure that as long as I'm going through paperwork hell again, I might as well take the opportunity of being stuck at home and not having a job lined up until September to just quit.

I'm also bipolar and take gabapentin, which manages my mood just fine. \[EDIT: I forgot-- I also have fibromayalgia, so I already have fatigue and brain fog and it's been way more of a struggle in the last two years, so I'm afraid of that getting worse, too.\]  But google isn't really helping, and of course my concentration is shit right now- most of what I'm finding is advertising for rehab centers or other treatment, and bullet pointed lists that say that the withdrawal lasts like 2 weeks.  I'm just at a loss, but I want the withdrawal I'm about to go through to be the last time.  I don't know what to do or expect.  Can anyone point me towards resources or advice? Thank you so much.",2,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.813185}"

Side effects were: off balance (slight feeling of being pulled forward and back), nausea, bad head pressure, weird head dissociation (feels like I am looking through someone else’s eyes, very detached feeling). I have been taking between 10mg-30mg daily for the past 15 years. 

I figured during quarantine I would give adderall a good break so I’ve been off it for two months now and my sleep sucks. My sleep wasn’t very good on adderall but it’s worse now. It takes forever to fall asleep and when I do I toss and turn all night. Luckily I can sleep in since I am working from home. I take all kinds of herbs: valerian root, sleep thru, l-tryptophan which don’t work that great. I have some over-seas benzo knock offs which work but I try to not take those very often.

Today I felt like sharing my experience and maybe it will help anyone who is struggling with meth addiction, this might be a TW but I am gonna keep it pretty positive :)

I had always messed around with drugs, since I was 13, and a lot.. then i tried meth when I was about 18, and never went back, I used every single day from that point on.

I was in a 7 year relationship during most of the ordeal, which was extremely toxic from both parties, I wont get into that though. This time, last year, we broke up and I had just gotten into the stims online community at the beginning of that year.

I met a guy from Texas on a stims discord, naturally we started video chatting every day and doing meth ""together"" for hours. A lot of crazy shit happened in that time, our relationship grew really intense and our goal was to be together. He tried sneaking into Canada because he was a felon and Canada is strict, and I had ongoing warrants that I didnt deal with

He got arrested and detained and deported at the border, and met a friend and went to get clean and travel, and we didnt talk much for a few months.

Meanwhile, my addiction was at its peak, using a half oz a week at its worst. I had never fucked with needles but one day I was bored and said fuck it. I got my neighbor to shoot me up, and that was it, all I cared about was the needle.

He was back in texas right when this all happened, when I decided to bring my addiction to its next level.  
I loved him but at the time not enough to stop.

After a few more months of chaos, getting kicked out of my place, moving in with my religious grandmother, having her find out about my use, doing sexual acts for the drug (which is something I never thought it would come to for me) my partner was sick of watching me destroy myself and gave me an ultimatum to leave and come travel in the US with him, and create something that will help other people  who struggle with addiction

About a month before that my grandma helped me get my passport and ID so I was ready. I had about 2 days to get to washington, and so I packed my bag, didnt tell anyone in my personal life and left.

It was the best choice I have ever made in my life. I wont lie and say it wasnt a bit rocky at the beginning, we both trigger each others addictions and we have relapsed 3 times (only for a day each time) but I dont think I would have ever been able to quit, nor did I know I wanted to quit, if it wasnt for this experience.

We rode freight trains hobo style through the west coast, taking psychedelics and smoking a lot of weed and now here I am on the other side of the continent, waiting for this COVID bs to finish up so we can leave again.

I cant say it was ever easy, there was points were my cravings were unbearable but I do believe now my addiction for travelling and new experience is way more than my addiction for meth

Theres probably a lot of stuff im missing haha but if anyone is struggling with meth or any addiction and needs help, and is willing to let it all go and wants to try hopping a train, please DM me, we would love to help you and I mean that from the bottom of my heart.

I had no idea that this is what I needed, but trains and psychedelics deffinitely have changed my life

If anyone has any questions or needs helps or whatever please dont hesitate! <3


tldr: Struggled with meth abuse everyday for 7 years, started using the needle, fucked my whole life up really bad and burned a million bridges. Had someone who cared about me give me one last chance and I packed a bag and left Canada to hop freight trains with my partner and quit meth and its been a life changing experience!",73,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.49647903}"

I'm a 30yr old male addicted to stimulants, I also have a very addictive personality so I have a hard time keeping things under control.

I've been abusing ritalin/concerta/vyvanse/coke on/off for the last 9 years. Recently, I've been binging and snorting ritalin, it ranges from 2-30 pills per day. But any time i have the chance to get high, I do it. I've experienced some psychosis during the last 2 big binges, gambled online for 10 hours straight, accumulated big debt and now im depressed and seriously starting to worry im going to spiral out of control... Although I clearly already am. I'm omitting alot of details about going off the rails with coke while drinking because it hasent happenned in the last little while. As I get older I'm not going out to bars as much and partying hence why it's probably subsided.

I've been extremely fortunate where I was always functioning and able to hide my problem. I got a university education and played semi professional sports. Now I have a very good career and an amazing job with amazing earning potential. 

I recently got out of a long term relationship with a very career driven girl. She didn't know that I was abusing the prescriptions (she also has one but rarely used it). But as my usage got worst, I started to distance myself. I didnt have a sex drive and often would go on the couch on my computer and watch porn while high instead of going to bed with her. We coined it as a mutual breakup, but deep down I know it's because of the drug usage that the relationship failed.

Most people would think i'm crazy to risk it all, but addiction does crazy things! Anyways, after some serious depression and self loathing, I've come to the conclusion that I need help. I've reached out to my local addiction and metal health department and was told that there is a 2 week wait list for a consultation.

This seems like a long time and am ready to make the change now, what are suggestions to do in the meantime? I'm also thinking about an out-patient program so that I can still work during the day. 

I also plan on coming clean to my mom. It breaks my heart because I know how devastated she will be. She's been my biggest supporter my whole life... I'm tearing up as i'm writing this part.

Anyways just looking for some guidance, I really want control of my life back.

I've had an issue with abusing adderall for many years now... when I moved in with my currently boyfriend 3 years ago.. I found out he had like three months worth of 30mg adderall... He didn't know I had an issue with the drug and I didn't tell him. Well I let myself slip and decided to take a couple.. that is what started this entire downward spiral... I ended up using all of his pills and ended up having to admit it to him.. he would have found out anyway. He was furious.. but did forgive me and we moved on...

Then I was in his moms house one day and I came across a STOCKPILE of adderall.. Like.. Idk why his family does this but I guess they get prescriptions and like... wont take them and they just pile up? IDk... but I was like oh fuck me.. here it is again.. and of course I was tempted to sneak a few.. and a few more and few more and a little here and a little there.. anytime I felt like it.. I mean.. 

It's been 3 years of this... (not so much the past year only a couple stints including the most recent one) but now I've gotten to the point that the amount missing can't NOT be recognized.. and I know this.. been living with that guilt and fear/anxiety for a year now.. and I actually did manage to stop for a while.. like.. to stop taking them because.. well, they're almost gone and I think they would notice if the bottle was COMPLTELY empty... and who knows.. they're from like 2010 or earlier.. they might have become less effective and thats why I always thought I needed more.. or maybe I just became addicted them.. (duh)

Then it came the season to get to doing more things done, spring cleaning and yard work and so on... and I was like.. well if it's already this low, doesn't matter if I just grab a few more.. and then I'm like.. I REALLY can't take anymore.. but at this point.. I may as well just have taken the bottles completely. 

I'm living with this intense guilt and fear for what I have done in this drugs grasp and couldn't stop myself from taking them. I'm guessing when she finds out.. (assuming she will at some point) theres nothing I can do to make it better.. I think i've dug myself in a hole here.. worrying that she will cut me off and out and I'll lose my relationship as well... I don't think she will be cool about it. 

yeah, I have ADD and yeah this drug helps me a LOT.. but I've also been known to abuse them so I can't trust myself with them... I cannot control the urge to take them if they are in my reach. I think its a combo of self hatred and wanting to be more productive and social and successful and simply enjoying the way it makes me feel. I also take prescription pain meds for chronic pain and they make me sleepy and more depressive so of course Adderall makes me feel more awake and happy. Whatever, it doesn't matter...

Idk what to do... I've even gone so far as to contemplate if it was possible to make sugar pills to replace the ones that were taken... Or if I could get someone to prescribe it to me so I could put them back. It's a mess and I don't know if I can do anything at all to make this better... 

I know I have an issue with these.. and i've told my boyfriend and my family that they can't keep that stuff around me or I will be tempted to take it. (He doesn't know about the ones at his parents house) I can't stop myself most of the time... I simply can't be around it.. and yet I came into a relationship with someone who had tons of it and who's family also has tons of it.. it's like a trap that was set just for me and since I was more depressed 3 years ago, the drug was a very welcome change. 

Now I just wish I could erase it from time and never come in contact with this fucking drug again... but the damage is already done.. I'm just waiting for someone to figure it out. I just needed to say this and hear some feedback because I literally have NO ONE TO TALK TO ABOUT THIS and it's really got me miserable and scared and angry at myself.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.55673856}"

Hours go by and one of his roommates starts to fish out/OD and needed to be rushed to the hospital because he is overheating and cant see straight. I start to head home, bumping GO:OD AM because it was the most recent Mac tape at the time. As I'm crossing the bridge it gets to the second half of Perfect Circle/God Speed, where Mac is talking about ODing and dying and how his family and friends would react wishing they could have done more and could have him back. That part struck a chord with me and I actually started to cry because I didnt want to devastate my family like that considering what I had just seen at my friends house. So at that moment I decided to clean up my act and never touch that shit again.

Weed story: I was shopping at LIDL when I got a text from someone that Mac Miller had overdosed and died. I couldn't believe it, I nearly collapsed on the floor right then and there. I headed home, put on my Swimming hoodie that had arrived literally the day before, and bawled my eyes out while I took GB after GB. Time went by and I realized that the weed wasn't helping, the overwhelming pain was still there. So that night I put it down and decided to go to an NA meeting the next day. Went to the meeting, picked up my chip, and I dumped my weed in the river right then and there. Afterward I went to a tattoo shop and got my Mac Miller tribute tat on my left calf. 2.5 months went by and I relapsed because I was upset about a girl. That lead to a spiral of depression and self loathing that didn't let up until I decided to get sober again November of last year. I was listening to Mac and crying again and decided that I was going to be better and do better, and the first step was putting the weed down again. So I did just that. 6 months have passed and a lot has happened. I've wanted to use again many times but I stopped myself by thinking about my promise to Mac. So thank you Mac, for saving me twice.

Scroll down to ""why I'm here"" title if you dont want to read so much.

Background: 

I am 21 years old with a history of drug use starting at age 12.
I didnt use anything apart from cannabis until I was 15. From there I tried mdma and coke and of course I loved them both.
I used mdma and/or coke reguarly once or twice a week along with some alchohol for around 3 years. I ended up being at the point where I was taking 10+ pills a session and didnt really think anything of it as a couple of my friends were doing the same. At 18 I moved city stopped using MDMA and coke. For a couple months I stuck to just smoking weed and a few beers here or there. I started to use a mix of benzodiazepine based drugs. Maybe 3-4 days out of the week and only at night for sleep and rest. As I was focused on study and training at the gym. Eventually got bored with them and just stopped, didnt feel any negative side effects or withdrawals really. Between the ages 19 and 20 I started to party more often again. Resulting in I'd say 4-6 times a month getting drunk and taking coke. This lasted until around January last year. I still continued to drink but much less and didnt bother so much with coke except for a handful of rare occasions but I never bought it. 

Fast forward to September last year I ended up losing a role model and close family member very suddenly. Alongside this my close family also had some big problems in terms of relationships/mental health issues that all came to breaking point around the same time. After this i started to drink and take coke more often once again. This slowly progressed into an issue but I'd say I was using alcohol and coke around 6-8 times a month so not daily use. This continued till january this year.

Why I'm here:

At the start of February this year a friend of mine I was visiting overseas offered me speed paste which until this point I had not knowingly consumed as I didnt think much of it. I was wrong. First time using it I ended up smashing it everyday for a week. (Slept every night still) For about two weeks after this experience I was using almost daily and by week 4 until present day I have used speed paste daily apart from a couple days here and there when I was sleeping or on benzos. I feel trapped. I know it's a stupid way to deal with my issues or feelings but I cant see a way out. I have progressed to using a g sometimes more a day. I also drink alchohol daily but nothing crazy just a four pack. I sleep maybe around 14-20 hours a week. I am conscious of my decisions and the effects it is having on me mentally and physically but for some reason I cant stop. Last three weeks or so I  have been having some pretty wild hallucinations and obsessive paranoid/depressive thoughts. I am starting to not feel like myself at all anymore almost in the third person at times. I feel lost. 

I need to get off this before I'm in too deep for myself and my relationship which is also suffering. I have also cut off my family as they are quite toxic at the moment due to the reason mentioned above. I am currently still managing to hold down my job which is quite high stress (hospitality) but I dont know how much longer I can go. (Other stim/alcoholics also work there) 

What was the best way you all found were to get off this stuff?

What are some hard reduction techniques I can use to help myself while using and coming off of it? 

Any help big or small is appreciated and I'm am also up for conversations over PM if you have any further questions.

And if you took the time to read all this I appreciate it alot. The people I have around me dont understand and i dont have the courage to visit the doctors or speak to a therapist currently.",9,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4608829}"

Initially I was just using it in low doses to get schoolwork done, but it quickly turned into me taking larger doses so that i could get high bc i craved the speedy/tweaky feeling.. I knew i had a problem and the weight loss really concerned me, so I cut back on my adderall usage and was using it maybe once every week or two from february-april. Recently ive picked up my adderall use though:/ I’ve been using it pretty frequently and i know ive lost weight bc of it and since the beginning of the year ive lost contact with my dealer that was selling me his prescription and have turned to using presses from random dealers, which im almost certain are just meth. I’m so tired of letting this substance control my life! I’m tired of planning my schedule around my adderall usage, of the anxiety/panic attacks resulting from the comedowns, and the physical effects of bunging and not sleeping/eating for days. I recently got into a relationship with a really great guy just a couple months ago and i don’t want me abusing adderall to have a negative affect on our relationship (he knows i use it and he is aware that i was very addicted, im just scared for how if i spiral again it could damge what we have). I think i’m finally ready to go completely sober and quit using this substance, I want to change and better myself, not fall back into heavily abusing adderall again. I’ve already quit other hard drugs and even stopped smoking weed, but this substance really just has a hold me.

As of now only my wife knows, others know of my past and the things I used to do but none has grabbed me and held on as tight as meth. To my embarrassment my wife has caught me with my stash multiple times over the last few months. She carries all this by herself with no one talk to. Caught using the day before mothers day what a great gift. I've ruined many moments with my use, and God i love my kids so fucking much to lose them would break me. I'm a great Dad and I know it but I'm going to lose it all and if that happens ill never get clean. We go through cycles, I get caught, sober up, get clean everything starts to return to normal until slowly i start using again and eventually go back to heavy daily use. I feel so much guilt putting this all on her. Today she said if it wasn't for the kids so would have been long gone but she sees how much  the love and admire me and know it would break them if I wasn't in there life. Why do I keep tossing this life away. I'm not suicidal but I have days where I think if I was to just die they would be sad but in the end they would get over it and move on and she would never have to tell them about there junkie Dad. The Dad that picked drugs over them and there Mom. I basically begged her to stay. To help me as selfish as that may be. Where do we go from here? Who can we both talk too? I said I would do anything if that means telling my family or hers, my boss, our friends, treatment. We both agreed talking with someone would be a good first step. We don't live in a big city center but I have to try something. She's so exhausted and broken all by my hand and I have to fucking try.

Has anyone else experienced these issues? Are they possibly heart-related?","Male, 23, CW: 200 lbs. Athletic (frequently run and lift weights) but also a little chubby. We’ll call it my quarantine gains. No known family history of heart problems with the exception of my grandfather on my mom’s side, who had a few strokes, the first one occurring at 49—was also a life-long smoker. Only real family health problem is diabetes (type II in all cases), but this does not apply to my mother or father. I get occasional migraines with aura, but they’re rare—a few times per year at most. I drink occasionally but never to excess, and I don’t smoke, but I do vape (with nicotine). I am also a former amphetamine/stimulant addict (not meth, but Adderall, Vyvanse, Ritalin, and Focalin in very recreational doses). I still use occasionally, but nowhere near to the degree that I used to (and not nearly the same doses). But this past abuse is what concerns me.

Whenever I read about the symptoms of heart disease or a heart attack, they mention feeling pain in certain locations: Chest, neck, shoulders, left arm, between the shoulder blades, upper abdomen, etc. What has me worried is that I occasionally experience pain in these locations, but it seems damn near impossible to define exactly what ""heart pain"" feels like. Are the pains sharp like someone stabbing you with a needle, or are they dull pains as if someone is pressing down on you? Does the pain typically only occur in one place at a time, or does it always radiate to the other areas? Are the pains constant or do they come and go? Below I’m going to list what I usually experience when I start to feel anxious about it, but these symptoms also describe the way I would feel on the comedown of a heavy binge. Hopefully someone else whose dealt with this in the past can share their experiences:

&#x200B;

\- Sharp pain in the left and right side of the neck near where the carotid artery is located. Always brief and randomly occurring. Unable to relieve by stretching, but doesn’t usually last long enough for stretching to make a difference anyway.

\- Same sharp pain as my neck, but in my jaw. Always briefly occurring.

\- Burning sensation in my upper back/lower neck, on top of the spine, where that big “bump” of your spine is, just below your neck. Once again, always brief and randomly occurring. Sometimes gets better with stretching—sometimes doesn’t.

\- Shooting pain in my chest on either side of my rib-cage, but usually toward the center. Sometimes I can feel the pain to the touch, which leads me to believe it’s likely costochondritis. It almost always gets better when I change positions, and it seems to worsen after drinking alcohol.

\- Very brief burning sensation in my upper left pectoral, just below the collarbone. This one occurs more frequently that the others, but it never lasts long, and it’s not quite as “agonizing”. Again, could just be costochondritis.

\- Sharp stabbing pain on the outside of both of my shoulders where they begin to connect with my triceps. Generally short-lived, but lasts longer than other symptoms. Sometimes alleviated by moving my shoulder—other times not.

\- Light sensation of pressure in my upper chest near where it connects to my neck. Doesn’t feel like I have a weight on my chest, but it feels like something’s pushing on it. Can lead to a globus sensation that makes me feel like I constantly need to swallow or pull my shirt collar away from my neck. Usually lasts for a few days at a time, though it’s a rare occurrence. Best alleviated by laying flat on either my back or stomach.

\- Tightness in my upper abdomen, just below my rib cage. Gets worse after a large meal. Doesn’t happen often, but usually lasts for a few days when I experience it.

\- Pain between my fingers on both hands that generally comes and goes depending on how I hold my hand. If I squeeze my fingers together it gets worse, but aside from that, it doesn’t really bother me.My fingers also sometimes feel tingly.

\- Tingling sensation in my feet when I lay down to go to bed at night. Usually only happens if I was on my feet a lot during the day, so I’m not too concerned about this one. That said, I also used to experience this often after an amphetamine binge, which leads me to believe it could be blood flow related.

\- Strange breathing pattern where my exhale doesn’t feel “smooth”. Instead, it feels more… I don’t know, “jagged”? From what I understand, shortness of breath is when you literally feel like you’re struggling to get air. I never feel that way. Just that sometimes my breaths are shallower and like I need to take more in order to feel right.

\- Shaky legs when walking downstairs. Never upstairs—only down.

\- Dull pain behind my left eye. Never lasts more than an hour. This one occurs far more rarely than any of the other symptoms, though because I get occasional migraines, it could be related to that.

\- A “heavy” heartbeat that usually only lasts a few days at most and gets better with sleep. I wouldn’t quite call them palpitations, but I become hyper-aware of it. Feels like its pumping harder than normal.

\- One slower, heavier heartbeat when I take a deep breath and then exhale. This is probably related to normal sinus rhythm, but it seems to be potentiated by stimulants (only caffeine nowadays, but Adderall would cause the same thing).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I’m well aware of the typical heart-related symptoms such as dizziness, shortness of breath, nausea, weakness, chest pressure, and pain that worsens with physical activity. But out of all the resources I’ve looked into, they’re NEVER specific about what the pain feels like or how long it lasts (aside from one source that said more than two weeks is a cause for concern). I’m sure I’m probably fine, and I’m sure anxiety has a lot to do with it, but as a former stimulant addict, I can’t rule out having concern for the muscle that keeps me alive.

I’ve spoken to my parents about seeing a cardiologist, but because I’m on their insurance, there’s not much I can do, and they think I’m just being paranoid—“You’re too young to have heart problems.” Thing is, they don’t know about my past drug abuse, so that’s why I want to hear from those of you who are in the same boat.

Real quick, I also want to mention that I posted this in /r/AskDocs but I made a few edits before posting here since this sub seems a bit more chilled out and less formal.  I proofread everything, but if the syntax/formatting seems a little whacky in certain places, then that's why.

UPDATE: I shot 1 gram of meth into my veins over a 12 hour period 9 days ago. That was my second session IV. I was admitted into the psychiatry ward 24 hours later (yes, in the middle of a pandemic) for a psychotic episode. So I’m 9 days clean.

Here I am, as a 20 year old premed who finished his freshman year minutes ago.  Upon pressing the 'submit' button of that last exam,  I grabbed the pill bottle and poured the remaining 20 little blue devils into the toilet, pissed all over them, and flushed the greenish-blue toilet water. It's been two years and a month since I began poisoning my fucking soul  by popping addies.  **That kid from two years ago, who was pleasure-seeking, optimistic, extroverted and excitable kid, with so much energy and resilience, is dead.  Slowly but surely, I've all but lost the ability to feel genuine interest, satisfaction, joy, closeness or pleasure.  I have entirely forgotten what excitement and a state of flow feel like.  My mind is filled with either confusion and mild anxiety as to what the fuck I am feeling, or just random, unrelated bullshit.  The anhedonia and constant mental bullshit means I pass the time doing mindless, unfulfilling activities, simply to escape the discomfort of boredom dissatisfaction.** 

I am truly grateful that I've been dealt such a good hand. I've had a safe, functional and loving family for my whole life, and a blissful childhood.  Seeing I come from an upper class family, I've never endured the hardships of food insecurity, poverty or crime.  I have the resources to attend a top 20 university as a premed.  

A little about myself, I'm a 20 year old half filipino dude.  I'm fortunate for many reasons.  Appearance-wise, I'm average height, muscular and, stated with humility, handsome.  Though diagnosed w ADHD, I've always been bright, clever, thoughtful and logical in the classroom.  I've never had issues making friends because of my lovable and zany crackhead energy.   With good company, I'd bring energy, absurdity, laughs and the fun to the group. I also had passion, focus and direction.  Up until this year, I was a serious soccer player - I probably could have gone low level D1 but chose D3 in favor of academic prestige.  On the field, I transformed from a joker to a general, as tenacity and hard, clean tackling were my strengths.  As a center mid, I would direct and organize teammates, with a focus on improving our team's tactical system and a no bullshit attitude.  When I played shitty, it was hellish, but It *always* gave me an overwhelming motivation to do better next time.  Playing well or winning was pure euphoria.  Sometimes for several days, I just felt this extreme contentment, and every time I thought about how well I played, I was just so damn happy.  **Of course, I would experience anger, anxiety, confusion and boredom.  But, no matter what, I would always be able to find genuine joy in the world.**

 Drugs enter the picture in 10th grade.  Aside from the immediate intoxication, I loved thinking about how each drug amplified certain things in life and parts of my personality.  I loved how weed made me giggly and kinda retarded, and I loved how alcohol made me wild and ridiculously extroverted.  As much as I enjoyed getting fucked up, I never even came close to having a problem with booze or weed.  **I never used drugs for escape - only for enhancing life.**

Finally, here is where the naïve, overconfident 11th grade me begins the journey with amphetamines.  On the Friday before a busy weekend in January of 2018, my friend brings up the topic of Adderall.  Before an official diagnosis, I knew I had adhd.  Not surprisingly, I do the math: ADHD kid + ADHD drug = safe, clinically-approved productivity.  At this point, I had zero expectations as to what I was in for and how I would feel.  Shit, at this point the only stims I take are 5 hour energies before soccer games, and I loved them.  The focus, the energy and the exhiliration - from only 200 mg of *caffeine* \- was my baseline here.  So she gives me the Adderall (which was actually Vyvanse but I had no idea), 40 mg, blue and white.  

Woke up Saturday morning, ate breakfast, popped it and made some coffee.  Sometime later, as I slogged through my required reading, I started taking detailed, comprehensive and ridiculously thorough margin notes.  The reading, which I normally wouldn't be thrilled to do, became fascinating.  Reading the mundane book felt interesting, exciting, and of great importance.  *Oh shit,* I thought.  *This is it.*  As I'm probably peaking, I enthusiastically decide to start the 7 page precalc packet I've been dreading.  This exact moment I remember in *vivid* detail:  I was listening to WORK remix by asap ferg.  It sounded  otherworldly.  Each note clear and crisp, the beat powerful and thumping, and asap's wild, untamed and savage adlibs lighting up my brain.  To put it mildly, I was in the fucking zone like never before.  So much so that I finished the final page of the math packet, fully expecting more fascinating problems to analyze.  But to my displeasure, there was no 8th page.  I couldn't believe it, but I was *pissed off that I finished my math homework because it was so intensely interesting*.  **This 40 mg Vyvanse is what led to me fucking myself:  40 mg Vyvanse = 15 mg Adderall, but I thought the Vyv I took was adderall.**      

Fast forward to March 2018.  My grades start to really slip, I get an evaluation, adhd diagnosis.  Not shocking.  Later, I see a psychiatrist and I have an Adderall script by April.  They start me on the 10 mg XR trial runs but that magic number of 40 mg is seared into my head.  Sure, the 10 and 20 mg doses  helped chill me out and facilitated academic focus.  But I wanted the ""40 mg"" rush that forced me into  hours of laser sharp focus anywhere, anytime, that made everything exhilitaring.  At the end of April 2018, I had a script for 40 mx xr with a 15 mg ir booster for the afternoon.  What I did not have was enough caution or awareness as to what could happen - **my eyes saw a medically and parent approved life hack - not just a performance enhancer, but a potent life enhancer.**

I was taking 40 mg most days in May of 2018, with no issues at all.  The 40 mg yielded consistently positive results: laser focus on command, profound analysis, motivation to work, music enhancement, increased interest/importance for everything, mild euphoria, and even a desire to socialize.  Even better, the crash wasn't a crash, it was just not feeling stimmed.  No exhaustion, depression or apathy, only a return to reality.  June-August, I used like 15 mg IR 1-2x a week to study for SATs, again no problems or tolerance.  

Senior fall (fall 2018) is where shit hits the fan.  Overly determined on getting into the college I'm currently enrolled in as it's damn hard to get in here (thanks, soccer), **I approached senior fall with the mindset that every detail of every assignment would be perfect, and that I would dedicate my Friday and Saturday nights to work if I saw fit.**  Of course this was easy for me to say before I developed legit adderall tolerance, as popping a pill and being in the zone for hours in my room was intensely pleasurable.  So, I developed some seriously unhealthy habits.  While on the high school soccer team and wired as fuck constantly, I lost serious weight: went from 145 to 135 in 2.5 months. I discovered the dynamic duo of porn and adderall, thus stopped paying any attention to girls in the real world.  But **because I was taking 40-60 mg amphetamine every single day for 3 months while ignoring the things I actually cared about, I was essentially destroying my personality and soul without realizing it.**

As you all probably know, the effects of Adderall change subtly but drastically over time.  At the end of September of 2018, I remember how the Adderall's effects of increased sociability and were euphoria were waning.  but I actually *loved* how intense, serious, driven and antisocial I was on adderall.  **I felt like a fucking beast - When addy'd up, I was addicted with the rush that competition and achievement provided. I genuinely believed I could thrive without the distractions of friendship and compassion.**  lmao what bullshit.  Fast forward to thanksgiving break of 2018, my first time off adderall since September of 2018.  I'm always feeling a vague, indescribable feeling of dissatisfaction, barely noticeable at the time.    I do know that being with my family for thanksgiving doesn't evoke that emotional warmth and the serene happiness that it used to.  I just felt a vague emptiness which I'd never experienced before.  This was seriously confusing to me.

Under the belief I needed adderall to do academic work, I continued to take it thru June 2019 not everyday, 4-5x/week.  The effects of adderall continually changed.  In the winter, the intensity from 40 mg adderall was replaced by a sort of frantic, unpleasant stimulation.  The motivation, music enhancement, sociability and mood boost was completely gone at this point.  By spring of 2019, I had two panic attacks, horrific sensations which I'd never come close to experiencing on adderall.  At this point, the only thing I could actually focus on while addy'd was porn or video games.  

Fast forward to last summer, which I spent Adderall-free, but I was depressed the whole time, I just tried to convince myself I wasn't.  Fucking stupid.  Inevitably, at a demanding university as a fucking premed I reverted back to addies.  After 3 months of complete abstinence, they were dangerously effective.  Aside from euphoria, sociability and music enhancement, Addiess still allowed me to get deep in the zone.  And, as an idiot would know, the effects diminished over time.  **For me, adderall is non a sustainable treatment whatsoever.**

So, finally, let's fast forward to today.  Since march break/coronavirus pandemic seriously took off, I've been isolated in my house with mountains of academic work to complete that I give 0 fucks about.  Thus, I've been popping addies at least 5/7 days of the week.  **I took 85 mg Adderall today to simply feel awake; I still lacked any focus, organized thought efficiency.**  Adderall simply gives me a vague, physical stimulation with no mental attributes.  Off of it, I have absolutely 0 energy or intensity. More importantly, I fully lack passion, focus and purpose.  I have lost my ability to feel joy, interest and contententment w/ the present moment.

It's now 11:04 on the east coast and I'm drunk.  Alcohol doesn't make me a wild, euphoric party animal anymore.  It simply numbs the boredom and purposelessness constantly surrounding me.  So, for the time being, it's all good, I'll feel shitty tomorrow but fuck it. I'm taking a gap year focused exclusively on meditation, rehabilitation and the ability to enjoy life as it is once again.  I sure hope it works, because if it doesn't I frankly would choose death over this bullshit.  I feel like my happiest moments and my best self have already died.  But I suppose we'll see what happens; if life is joyful enough, I hope to be alive next year to look at this post and be grateful I soldiered on.  If not...I don't see the point in existing like this.",45,"{'rona': 1, 'virus': 1, 'pandemic': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7851528}"

It’s hard to talk about this stuff with friends/family and it gives me hope to see you cheer each other on.

I’m not sure if this is the right forum but I thought I’d ask if anyone has had experience getting off Addy’s and Benzo’s  at the same time. Just for context I run through about 60-90mg of adderall each day often taken with Xanax (.5 -1 bar). The addiction started a few years ago when I found the combo recreational and it just started to spiral out of control from there. 1mg of Klonopin each night for sleep, but sometimes I switch to Ambien because I’ll go through cycles where Klonopin does nothing for me - likely because I’m abusing Xanax and building a tolerance.

Has anyone dealt with withdrawals from this combination before? And if so, did you find it was easier to quit one substance first rather then both at the same time? Or was it easier to taper off of both simultaneously. Or just straight cold turkey? 

To be honest I’m deathly afraid of quitting either, I’ve had weeks where I was forced to (burning through my prescriptions too fast) and it’s hell each time. Any advice on how to approach this would be appreciated.",6,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46322814}"

as you saw, i am almost one month clean from meth. i tend to have an issue doing it on and off. whenever i am off i am clean for 6-12 months and during the course i get cravings but resist the urge, but of course i failed in the past. whenever i am using i am using for 4-6 months straight with no breaks. this is my 3rd time getting off it and i am so glad that i have not once had cravings at all. i am working out more and more, i am meditating and reading often as well. when i initially got clean last month i wanted to just see what it was like to be sober and not use. i enjoyed every second of it, of course i ate and slept a lot. but i am so much better. 8 hours of sleep, eating right, taking vitamins, feels like i have done 0 damage to my body. my teeth are healthy as i saw a dentist last week. even during my use i brushed and drank water and maintained my health ways i could.

At first, it worked wonders and I saw how much of a difference it made in my academic performance. Until I got hooked. I found myself being overwhelmed by projects and exams and due dates, and the minute I said “I’ll just take one extra for a small boost and that’s it” it was over for me. I began to spiral into the cycle of abusing it, saying I’d never do it again and this time would be different, to relapsing and doing the same shit over again. Nobody knew. A medication I was supposed to take 2-3x a day, I was taking 6-7-8x a day. I was popping these things like mints. And I was so ashamed. 

My health began to deteriorate. I became less social, more withdrawn from the world. I’m a 5’2 18 year old female and at the time I must’ve been like 16, but for me an average weight of around 115-120 dropped to 95 pounds and I hadn’t weighed that much since the 6th grade. It was bad. 

Until one day several months ago, I got ice cream with my dad and it just sort of came out. I told him I was abusing my prescription, it had gotten out of control and that I needed his help. At first he held onto it and distributed however many I needed for that week. But then he eased up and kept it on the kitchen counter and I did the same thing again. I told him, and the next time I saw my doctor I told him too. He kept the same medication but instead of taking instant release I was prescribed an extended release version of the same medication. So I tried it for awhile, and it’s like after finally telling someone, and a mix of the new prescription, things just changed. Like a switch flipped in me or something because I had no desire to keep up with that sort of pattern, I knew it was so bad and I saw the damage and toll it had taken on me and I realized that that wasn’t what I wanted for myself. 

So I went from taking twice as prescribed *everyday* to now using responsibly as prescribed and I even choose not to take it on the weekends when I don’t feel like I need it and just want to relax (: 

I understand that my experience is not the same as another person’s. But I just want to say that my personal experience is that things started looking a little brighter and I began to improve once I realized and really processed what the possible results where had I kept going down that path. I didn’t want it for myself. And I learned that the voice in my head that justified those patterns wasn’t benefitting me in any way. For me personally, I figured that handling the humiliation and accepting it for what it was and asking for help when I needed it, the shame was temporary and in turn, I was able to get better in the long term. I feel free. And I’m just happy and relieved to say I don’t feel like a slave to my own mind anymore, at least not in terms of that addiction and that point in my life",21,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7267682}"

I'm a muslim meth addict. Rare, but it happens. I got clean for eight months and accidentally slipped up in December. Ever since then I fail to relapse every eight weeks. Usually just for a night but I'm sick of it. Every time it gets harder to stop again. 

Right now it's Ramadan so I'm fasting and I also went vegan. I am willing to go to rehab but I don't want to if it's not necessary. I've been to rehab 8 times and while it's helped a lot I realized that I mostly need it to get through the 8 week mark. After that I can stay sober on my own. I have 5 weeks sober and have been fasting for 1 week. I am feeling the usual meth detox and 100x the speed and intensity because of the fasting.

 I dream about shooting meth every night and I wake up and it's like I'm high for a moment. Maybe this means it's leaving my system faster and I don't need to go to rehab? But if I do relapse it would be terrible. My 8 weeks is set to hit on Eid and it would devastate my family if I missed Eid AGAIN, especially if it were for a relapse (last year it was because of rehab).

My state also only funds rehab so many times. I'm not planning to relapse again but if anything happened and I really needed to go to rehab and I couldn't I would probably kill myself. I am afraid of blowing through all my chances. I also don't want to lose my job or get kicked out of school. Both would happen if I went to rehab, but I don't want to relapse again.
