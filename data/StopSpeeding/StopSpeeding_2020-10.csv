2020-10-30 09:40:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/jkwy60/adderall_is_going_to_be_the_literal_death_of_me/,Adderall is going to be the literal death of me.,"You know, I have made a lot of posts here on Reddit. And in my two and a half years of being an active user with over 900 posts on my account, I genuinely believe this is the most important/crucial one I have ever written.

Let me preface by saying: I do NOT have ADHD, hence why I believe Adderall affects me the way I am about to explain in this bible-lengthed post does. I am currently 20 years old, a junior in college, and am one of if not THE most irresponsible user of Adderall I know (I guess you could label me as an abuser of it), considering I don’t know any of you personally lol.

Having literally just become aware of how much this drug is actually fucking up my life (of which is technically my own fault to begin with) after literally just receiving an email from one of absolute humblest/kindest professors I have ever had in my college career thus far, who stated with a rather angrily upset/disappointed tone that I have missed three classes so far, and that if I miss anymore, my letter grade will drop by a half for each day I do not attend. Now, I know this might just seem like an email he sent as a result of looking out for me, but on a personal level, it was a damn wake-up call. Allow me to explain...

Holy fuck, actually. I don’t even know where to start!

Alright, first of all, I wish I did not love Adderall as much as I do, and I especially wish I listened to all the warnings people gave me over the years when they said I was on some pretty fucking thin ice on all of my “Adderall appreciation posts” that I’ve made in the past. I don’t know what it is with this drug... no, I mean like, I LITERALLY don’t know what to make of it! It’s so fucking beautiful and appealing, yet ironically it has the capability of putting you between a rock and a hard dick. Perhaps it is a demon disguised as an angel to lure you into its grasp to the point in which you can no longer function without it constantly (if not always) holding your hand.

I am just going to put the reality of which Adderall has completely blinded me from in a nutshell for you:

I have not touched, hell, even thought about any of my school assignments in over a week (and my agenda is loaded), I have not slept for more than 4, MAYBE 5 hours in over a week, and whenever I do manage to sleep and avoid taking any pills, it’s usually for 24 hours straight. Thus, I have missed about seven or eight classes in total now (not just the one the professor who sent me that email I mentioned above teaches; I mean all the classes on my damn schedule). I have barely eaten anything and am \~25 pounds lighter than what I should be, I got two parking tickets because I was too lazy to park my car in the fucking garage that I PAY FOR... LESS THAN LITERALLY ONE BLOCK AWAY MIGHT I ADD... I have been getting so much shit done lately (all of which will probably benefit me and my life by a factor of about 1⁄100, yet somehow Adderall makes it feel like those things actually hold some sort of significance), I have compulsively spent more money than I can admit and have been draining the fuck out of my bank account (of which is actually going to be in the ER soon), and I have isolated myself in the outside world because I have all the dopamine I need right here at home in a bunch of cursed, orange pills.

(That isn’t even everything, by the way. If I listed all of it, the previous paragraph would have been nearly twice as long.)

So, in summary, **my life is crumbling around me while I am in la la land.** That’s my situation in a fucking sentence. You want a TL;DR? There it is.

I have approached my excessive Adderall intake in no other way than the following: make excuses, find unreasonable purposes for popping another pill, and most commonly of all… deny, deny, deny. I′m sorry, but what in the name of Jesus Saint McFuck has gotten into my immature, lazy, fried ass brain to have come to this? (Oh wait, that′s right–it’s Adderall! Silly me, that was an easy one!)

With all that being said, I guess you could officially consider my furniture dusted, because I am in WAY too deep with this drug that DISTRACTS me from schoolwork (among other priorities), responsibilities, self-care (among many other things), and if there is an exit, believe when I say, I know it′s far… VERY far out of sight by now.

P.S. And you know what? Fuck you too, depression... maybe if you didn’t eat me alive every day, I wouldn’t be so compelled to take at least three times the amount of this shit that I ACTUALLY need.

And with that, I appreciate it if you made it this far, and (I know this is r/StopSpeeding, but) I truly hope you do not ever find yourself in the same situation as me because you matter, you are loved, and you deserve way better than any of this.

I’m proud of myself for going this long, and I’m looking forward to what day 100 feels like. Honestly I’m not feeling much different these days. Maybe closer to a midpoint than the low I was at when I quit. I remember the week that I quit, every time I left my job I’d be tearful, and I was crying a lot that week. The last day at that job was the last day I used. While I’m not tearful anymore I do feel an overwhelming sense of apathy all the time. I’ve had these consuming thoughts about how nothing matters, and unlike others I feel like I was better able to connect with people when I was on the drugs than without them. 



My thoughts are all over the place. I’ve been wondering if something is wrong with my brain. It’s almost like I can’t discern my own thoughts. I feel like I have no opinions on anything and planning things seems like it’s impossible.

I'm unaware of anyone who uses stims in the manner I do, and so I'm not quite sure how to approach it. I kept a pretty tight leash on my usage for a year or so, before it devolved into a binge of 3-4 doses of amphetamine in one day, once a week. It slowly escalated up a total of \~300 mg of amphetamine binged over 3 days every 10ish days. I've improved over the past 4 months though, I can regularly take 2-3 weeks off and I rarely binge, and never to nearly that intensity anymore.

At this point I feel so beaten down and disgusted with myself, and I want to quit, which I know is the first step. The problem I'm currently facing is that, ironically, the better I feel, the more tempted I am to use, so as I spend more time sober, I become more susceptible to relapses. I know it's ineffective but sometimes the cravings are so intense I feel like all I can do is sit still and try to fight it, and usually the craving wins.

Anyways, partially just kind of wanted to rant, but if anyone has faced a problem like this, I'd love to hear from you whether or not you've succeeded, and perhaps we can work together on it.

And also the person I became on it/how it left me feeling afterwards. 

My heart was literally beating out of my chest when I made the trip to get some and jeez it’s like I’ve been saying I don’t want it and how using it barely gives me any positive effects anymore, yet getting at least one pill for ‘safe keeping’ as my mind put it, was enough for me to go and grab some. Like if I know it isn’t good for me why would I need some for a stash later on? 

I know I don’t want to take it. I really don’t. But just having these pills on me is making me really want to even though I’m literally repeating to myself how awful I’ll feel today if I do, how tweaky my conversations with people I care about will go, how paranoid and anxious I’ll be.

But it’s hard to not fall back on the one remaining issue in my life at this moment and it’s that studying and doing homework has become such a “I’ll do it later” / “I don’t care enough to do it” type of issue for me and I don’t know how to cope with that. I’ve genuinely tried to sit down and get it done but I don’t know, my cares for school this semester have gone straight out the window. 

I really don’t want to fall into the category of me being another statistic with adderall addiction, but Jesus. 

The last time I used I had a very hefty crash with it where I was depressed for weeks. I’m still rather depressed from it as it wasn’t that long ago, and that’s honestly not a word I tend to throw around often. Not to mention other things in my life not being so hot, it just feels so easy to give in to addiction / using adderall as a gateway for other things. 

I don’t want this to be a long post, I just honestly want some help and advice. I don’t know what to do about the problem itself, nor do I know what to do about my issues with focusing as it is. Like I really wasn’t that bad at school when I started using, I just wanted an extra boost. But now I’m so much worse than where I was.

I was researching articles on withdrawal and came across this community, read through many of the posts and it’s a very supportive and informative environment. Thank you for the space!


I’m well on my way to a serious adderall addiction - which to me is the same thing as a speed/meth addiction. I was doing pressed street pills in 2018 to help with work & studies during a stressful month. I naturally fell out of it - I’m a bit of a stoner and like psychedelics every few months, but uppers weren’t my thing. This summer I got hired F/T in my field (remote work) with two semesters left to complete my degree. Along with the other projects (art/community stuff) that I’m a part of, *and* the general lack of social/emotional support networks due to Covid (my city is quite locked down - therapy has so far been underwhelming), it’s been lots of new responsibilities/experiences coupled with unprecedented levels of stress and personal expectation. 


Tasks & deadlines piled up, and the grand all-day-nighters where I smoke a pack of cigarettes and finish assignments a/or reports a/or clean my place have been happening with increasing regularity. I picked up a fair amount last week and have enough on me to last a while - I’m also only doing adderall because I can get it from my friends who are prescribed it for cheaper than the lower quality street pills. I don’t want to try to finesse a prescription due to time+ the prospect of formalizing this dependency that I’ve been downplaying to myself until recently. 


There is definitely a big romanticization of it - how satisfying it feels to get so much work done all at once, and really how fun it is in the special >>getting things done zone<< that I curate for myself. I know I have some issues about self worth <-> productivity that I need to address, but it won’t be until after I graduate in April that I can meaningfully slow my (major) commitments down. 


I’ll stop for a few days to a week, but then I’m too low energy to keep up with everything, it all piles up again, and I need to pull another bender. I do the D3+B12, I’m getting better at consistent exercise, cooking, cleaning, and *I know that I don’t want to be living my life on meth all the time*, but I’m having trouble seeing a way out anytime soon. I keep doing higher doses more often. I’m telling myself I can accept it for now, hold on until winter break, and then use that time to detox. On one hand I feel like that’s just my addict brain making excuses to delay addressing things before I’m in too deep. On the other, I feel if I tried to go cold turkey now, then I would just repeat the cycle as I always do, and further my addiction + stress + guilt. What are your thoughts here? Is there a reasonable compromise between these two ideas?

But last night I had my first meth dream ever. It's really weird timing. I can't think of anything that would have subconsciously triggered me or caused my brain to project that particular imagery because I haven't been around the stuff in a long long time and I have not been having cravings.

There wasn't even any context or situation in the dream. It was very straightforward there was a pipe and a bag of meth and I checks to make sure I was alone in the room and then had a very detailed dream of the whole ritual of filling the pipe and smoking it. In the dream I even remember that instantaneous getting high feeling after inhaling. And that's kind of when I woke up.

I have semi aware lucid dreams when I wake up and so I remember being sort of half awake feeling this very familiar meth high, becoming afraid that I would jump out of my warm bed and start tweaking and cleaning my room and wasting my dey, and how was I ever going to get enough sleep now that I've smoked this crap, and finally thinking wait a minute this isn't right I don't have any so I'm not high. Phew. The Dream High dissolved instantly but I was almost about to jump out of bed and peek through the window blinds to make sure nobody knew I was smoking it. It was so realistic.

Then I rolled over and went back to sleep for real. I'm so glad it wasn't real. But it was so weird. There is no explanation because I have not been struggling the drug has not been around and I have not had cravings like I said.",14,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.989683985710144}"

That the vertebrae in your neck aren't supposed to be visible, or even really felt? I honestly have put on 50lbs. Yeah, there's some fat, but there's a lot of muscle too, in fact I feel almost like more than I had before the dark time, almost as if in addition to messing up my problem solving abilities I also managed to completely fuck up my endocrine system. I don't have gyno yet, but I do have this weird bump under the skin behind my ear that if I didn't know any better would surely have come to the conclusion it was an alien implant a couple months ago (although there is still part of me that secretly hopes this is true, rather than it simply being some sort of benign cyst.

My meal planning has gone completely out the window.. that bit I had planned to save for lunch tomorrow.. nope, that's after dinner dinner, and we just ate half a strawberry rhubarb pie too. Oh it hurts to sit or stand does it? Well let's eat some more.

I've taken to eating soda crackers like potatoe chips. I've had 8 slices of brown bread today, 4 with 2 cans of soup, another 2 with 4 eggs and a steak, and another 2 with jam just because. Entire packs of bacon weep in my presence. Apples, bananas, big blocks of cheese, more soup, crackers, cookies.. You know those wafer cookies? Entire pack, just gone, inhaled like it never existed.

And yet, I am still hungry.

I feel the tension boiling inside my belly, I can feel the little demon inside my brain going absolutely apeshit inside his little straight jacket, racing back and forth, boucing around and smashing himself along the insides of my skull. Eat. Eat. Eat more. MORE.

Then I came across Clayton Jennings and like I really want to do better, not always be ripping and running..

I could definitely use someone to talk to, even just words of encouragement. I also recently came off a 3 year 180mg daily Methadone prescription. I've only smoked weed but its state legal here. I'm just scared I'm going to mess up and lose everything I have been working for...
Even worse, I dont want to die...

Someone here mentioned it makes you a little like a emotional psychopath & I think that is a pretty fitting description. Because you are happy all the time, nothing bothers you & I never really thought about how that impacts the people close to you while I was on it.

Been off it I suppose about 11 weeks now after 6 years daily use (6-12 times a day) & I have to say, its not easy. I have good days and bad days & focus is still so hard. I am coming to the conclusion I just cannot operate at the level I used to.

Still I am left with the knowledge that in 6 years I achieved nothing. I would be lying if I said those 6 years were not fucking awesome from the moment I awoke to the moment I fell asleep (often waking up with the pipe still in my hand)

I think the hardest part is having the knowledge on how magnificent it made you feel.

Ultimately though the benefits became less & the reasons I took it up (weight control/sociability & focus) diminished to the point that the negatives (life on hold if supply fell through, loneliness of being the last one going, cost quadrupling during covid) outweighed the positives.

I also told my parents, they have helped me out so much & I could not have done it without them. People often say you need to do things for yourself. I do not always believe that, I could never touch the pipe again because I could never betray the trust of my parents after they have helped me get through this.  


Still a long way off yet. I still have trouble getting used to the negative emotion after not feeling it for 6 years & it sometimes catches me by surprise but I am getting there.

Not sure why I wrote this but it made me feel a bit better. I do miss the rush sometimes though.....",45,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9891078472137451}"

It was already heading south. But at the same time before I started I had interviews and stuff ready. But I binge for three days and ended up not caring about the employer calling me. After the binge knowing what I did sent me deeper into depression. I've had multiple suicide attempts. I have permanent heart palpations it seems. I can never feel happy anymore. All I do is crave the ppx. And it's all I think about day in and day out waiting for that 7 days to be able to feel another dose. On another note. I truly believe this stuff has brought on latent psychosis. I've had stim psychosis before with 4-fa. Ended up doing like 2 grams of it in 3 days a while back. But the psychosis from this broke me down. And now I always have question reality. See outlines of shadow spiders. Sometimes see random shadow bugs crawling on walls for a second. I've considered voluntarily committing myself. But idk if that's the right. Move. I need to get a job and get my life on track. That will only set me back more. I need advice on what to do. How to approach my family. They will hate me. I've been lying to them about having a job for so long. Meanwhile I was just sitting in a parking lot or at my gfs house. They're probably going to kick me out tbh. If they do ill have to live at my gfs house. She'd let me cause she understands. But I don't wanna be more of a burden on her. I just have no idea tho..

2020-10-16 21:39:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/jcmlgf/accountability_and_day_1_of_recovery_45hrs_since/,Accountability and Day 1 of Recovery (4.5hrs since last dose),"I started taking methylphenidate late November 2018 at 15mg x3 / day. Increased to 30mg x3 / day after 2-3 months. 

I started abusing (over prescribed dosage and insufflation) around late Spring 2019/ early Summer 2019. Initially (I believe) lightly, however I remember being on holiday in Amalfi at the rented apartment whilst my ex partner and her mom were on the beach, snorting before/ after going to meet them. Probably was snorting about 3-8 pills a day at the time. 

From September 2019 to November 2019 it got worse as had lot of work (elite professional services start-up) and I started going through prescription way too quick: snorting 10-20 a day easy, 2-3 day lack of sleep once every 2-3 weeks where I worked through the night.

Rationalised to myself that it was for work. That it was okay as I would take a week or two break here and there inc no dosing most weekends.
That it was actually good and under control, since I was truly being the most high functioning and successful I have ever been in my life (both personally and professionally), with insane continuous growth.

Then... mid-November 2019: my ex partner with whom we committed to for life and had a firm 2yr future plan ongoing half-way (naturally, also living together) split on me completely out of the blue without any rationale or cause: from hearing daily that I am the best person in the world, to her saying one unsuspecting night “I don’t respect you, you don’t do shit and I have been thinking what the fuck is the point for months”. Then 3 days later she told me that she was completely delusional and apologised. 

However, this led to a chain of events which led me to I find out things which have been happening behind my back. 

Long story short, I broke up with her mid-Dec 2019, she moved out mid-Jan 2020, we tried until end of Apr 2020 - at which point she went to therapy and then got a letter from her few weeks later that introduced the words “BPD” into my life and after 2 months of research I was confident to conclude it explained everything I all this time put down to her being overly emotional, immature and “somewhat” traumatised from her past life.

Back to my bullshit - from mid-Nov 2019, I went HAM. 10-30 pills a day - but it was still early days in this whole fuckery. 

I also upped my prescription from 10mg x3 / day to 15mg x3, but purposefully in a way so that I’d get 168 10mg and 168 5mg pills for 1.5 months prescription. 

From Feb 2020 onwards, I would go through 336 pills in about 1.5 to 2 weeks.

Do the maths, that’s about 35-40 pills a day (accounting for the day or two I slept/ couldn’t snort anymore). However, it wouldn’t be per day - it would be continuous and sustained, as I would not be sleeping at all for days at the time. Think longest without sleep was 5 days. As ran through prescription, would then have 2-4 weeks clean (first time rough - having 6-8 double espresso shots in 1 sitting x3 times a day in the office and still falling asleep in meetings).

With Ritalin, this has been going on until now - albeit some “decent” attempts and breaks to reduce usage but always ending up not giving a shit time and time again.

Alcohol played big part Jan 2020 - July 2020, each night coming from work picked up 5-8 bottles of 125ml 12.5% cherry wine OR 6-12 beers OR 1-2 bottles o’ wine for the night. Post July only 2-4x a week wasted on alcohol.

Also combined with frequent 3 days to 3 weeks long, heavy cannabis binges (~1-2g/ night) as well as heavy daily kratom use May 2020 - Aug 2020.


I have made myself completely oblivious through deceiving myself (as addicts do) to how bad it actually is. Especially since “I was high functioning” with amazing job, amazing relationships etc. 

Then post mid-Nov relationship fuckery I didn’t care. I was broken beyond belief at the incomprehensible nature of everything that was happening, happened behind my back and knew was to happen. So, I was super happy to be purposefully fucking myself up.

Seems like from what I am reading from others and research papers, I have about a 6 month recovery journey ahead of me at least with really heavy withdrawals. Science says ΔFosB in D1-type medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens have accummulated greatly in my brain by now (just in a 4-5 day binge 2-4 fold levels?!) - these are the cause of addiction in general and have very long bioavailability and half lives.

The way I see it, my brain is under emergency at the moment. Especially in terms of psychosis and development of mental illness/ personality disorders.

I am resolute, but what the absolute fuck have I done??? It’s like a dream where I achieved top 1% status for half a year having been building for 5yrs prior, life said “not yet - fuck you, here’s some unexpected dick to choke on”, so then I literally destroyed my life and tried to erase myself mentally because I wasn’t ever going to give into suicidal urges out of consideration for others - seemed like the next best option. What a dickhead.

I consider myself extremely stupid and privileged at the same time to be talking around this like it’s nothing and feel confident in getting out of it (delusional af), having finally made the choice to assess my past year and attempt to take accountability.

BUT. I will suffer. So thank you all for providing your stories, examples and materials that I will find very useful on this journey.

2020-10-16 21:11:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/jcm6n8/is_it_possible_to_be_functional_without/,Is it possible to be functional without stimulants once you’ve been dependent on them for so long? [POSSIBLE TRIGGER WARNING],"I love stimulants. I have for over 8 years. I was young, experimenting with different substances, until I had my first stim, cocaine. I fell in love. From there all I wanted was more of that hyper stimulated euphoric feeling. Tried crack, Adderall, Ritalin, loved them all. But it was  all over the first time I did meth. 

I smoked it, and from that first hit I was in love. Meth was (is imo) the perfect drug. I had never felt more powerful, motivated, happy, and ready to take on the world. This spiraled extremely quickly into a full blown addiction that took everything from me. After two overdoses it was time to say goodbye to my love. I haven’t had meth since 2012. 

However, I never stopped chasing that stimulant rush. Over the next 8 years I tried EVERYTHING I could. Got back on adderall. Ritalin, Huge amounts of caffeine, Modafinil, Adrafinil, Propylhexedrine, Nicotine, MDPV, Mephedrone, hell I even tried using DXM and the “stimulating” strains of kratom. Some were better than others, and a lot were fun and helped me through day to day life. But nothing ever even came close to what Meth gave me. And I’m no doctor or chemist, but I feel like these days stims of any kind barely do anything. 

I will soon be trying 3-FPM, but don’t have super high hopes. It will be my first experience with RC’s. I am also researching Cathinones. But, looking back, and even now typing this out, it seems crazy. But through the years I’ve tried to let stims go, but I become utterly useless without them. I can’t even get out of bed without some sort of chemical stimulation. 

These days a mix of a high dose of Adderall XR, Adrafinil, caffeine, Nicotine, and the occasional Methylphenidate are just enough to get me through the day. I wonder at this point if I could ever quit? I mean if I stopped right now, I’d lose my job, house, car, everything. I have a family I have to provide for. And I can’t even imagine the damage I’ve done to my cardiovascular system and the dopamine receptors in my brain. 

Sorry for the rant. I guess mainly I wanted to ask if there is a life after years of daily stimulant dependence, and if not, any suggestions on what I should try next? 

Also, I want to be honest here, so I will say I don’t want to stop. I love stimulants, and with my new descent into the world of RC’s, there is a literal buffet of different Stimulants to experience. But, I know this train can’t run forever. I’ve just been thinking about how this ride will end for me. Thank you to anyone who read all this, and to anyone who takes the time to reply.

I've never used stims myself, and his behavior honestly reminded me of someone who has bipolar disorder and refuses meds, although his ups and downs were too frequent to be bipolar.

He'd act like he was experiencing a manic episode for days at a time - hypersexual, not interested in consequences, hyperactive, talking continually and ""on top of the world."" Then he'd crash and show deep remorse and depression.

The denial ran deep; he told me that he was broken and needed help when he was crashing, as well as saying that he'd ""do terrible things to feel that way one more time"" (I'd assumed that he was talking about his ex-fiancée, at the time). Then, within a day or two, he'd be back to talking about how great he was and fucking everything.

I guess that I'm just wondering how likely it is that he knows that he has a problem and feels actual remorse. Was it all just a show he put on? I know that I need to stay away from him and the situation for my well-being, but I want to *get* it.

PLEASE HELP!,"So I have been on gabapentin (600mg/2x daily) for about a year for a disc issue. I quit the gabapentin about 3 months ago for a while because I felt stupid on it. The physical withdrawal was HORRIBLE. Sweating, going from freezing to burning up in a split second, muscle aches, NO energy, etc. I also had terrible depression from my brain I guess trying to level out. It was incredibly stupid of me to start using it again after what I went through, but it did. However, I decided I'm done for good yesterday. Here we go.


Well, since gabapentin make me feel unable to concentrate on things, lethargic, and tired all the time, I decided Adderall would be the best option to help. I have used it maybe 5 times my entire life (as in one dose each time). I have a friend that doesn't use it anymore and was on 30mg (instant release). I started taking it about 3 weeks ago. First few days it was GREAT! I then slowly realized, oh shit, I'm taking 90mg a day within a week and a half. With a little research, I realize I have messed up. I want off this stuff NOW. It's literally like eating candy at this point. I feel no different when I take it, at all. 

My question is, how much am I going to suffer getting off with this amount and time of use? Also, is the gabapentin going to make the mental side worse? (I know gabapentin works in the brain as well)

I would REALLY appreciate any advice. Anything at all. I took magnesium when getting off the gabapentin and that seemed to help a little, but it still SUCKED for about 7-8 days.

For me, it's always felt good, I haven't experienced negative side effects, I haven't felt like I needed more afterwards. But I guess she was different, bec she apparently decided to keep doing it. I know I remember at least one time a few weeks after the first time she asked me to do it again and I didn't want to, then I don't think I heard anything from her about it for a few months when we did it together again, at the time she still seemed normal, despite knowing she had done it a few times without me as well, I didn't pick up on anything that made me think she had any issues with going on. We've dabbled in a few drugs together and she always went a little farther than me, like we tried coke, I just did it the one time but she would always do a little more, like just a cocaine week or whatever, so I figured that's all it was with her doing meth a few more times than me. 

The 2nd time was in July, I haven't seen much of between now and then but when I did she was always really quiet and would be like testy and not in a great mood. Idk if that had anything to do with a developing drug problem or if she was going th something emotional that may have contributed to her turning towards meth more. But fast forward to yesterday, I hadn't seen her in like a month, she had visibly lost weight, she's still a healthy weight but definitely smaller, her weight tends to fluctuate tho so I didn't think much of it. There was no plan to do meth, but she invited me to spend the night at her place, I thought we'd just smoke weed, but when we get there she pulls out the meth, I guess I just thought sure why not, should be fun. But after we took it I noticed how strange she got like, compared to when we did it before, it was affecting her more than me (she may have been doing much bigger lines than me), like she would be like totally blanked face, and she kept like moving her jaw over making her face look droopy. Like she was just trying to snap her jaw which is normal on meth, but like she just held it like that. And we had plans to watch a bunch of stuff and all this and the entire time, for like 18 hours we hung out, she just kept the tv on youtube and she just selected a song and paused it and would go find another song and pause it. And like I could barely get her to say a word to me, it was just really bizarre, and not at all how she was acting the last time I saw her do it. So all that, plus noticing she bought in a much larger quantity than in the past made me sure this is or is becoming a regular thing for her to do.

I did notice a big red flag before the meth became part of the night, that her apartment is absolutely filthy, and I initially figured it was a mental illness thing. I guess that's an important factor too is that she's bipolar and tells me she has another diagnosis that she doesn't want to share with anyone. I don't know if she stays on her meds. I imagine her mental health failing led her to self medicate with drugs, but the drugs are probably just making her mental illness worse. Does anyone have any advice, I really have no idea how to approach this. She gets really sensitive and upset about being called out on things, I'm scared if I confront her about it she'll just get upset and push me out so I can't even try to help anymore and it'll just push her farther into it. I don't really know anyone else I can ask to help me, she has a small group of friends that I don't really know at all and that frankly probably aren't good people for her to be around. I know her parents are in the area but I have no idea how to get in contact with them. So please, any advice or anything is so appreciated

I knew it was a horrible drug and it was doing terrible things to my body, my social life, my relationships, and my marriage.   BUT IT WAS FUN!!!!!!!!!  AND OOOOH, THE ENERGY!!!!! And then it wasn't.  It got gross and scary.  I'm more committed to quitting than I have been since I started 10+ years ago.  

I'm off that awful shit one week today.  I know that's nothing to hang my hat on but it's something.  And this week sucked.  The last time I got high, I knew I was out of control.   I was hallucinating and I was afraid I was going to die.  
I've made it a week a few times before so I knew i was looking at days of being dead exhausted. (I slept 20 hours on Friday.)  The last time i went back, it wasn't really bc i was craving the high, but because I needed to get out of bed, get a shower, leave the house, etc.  

I guess the point of my post is to ask those of you who've been here - how long until I start to resemble a human again? When will I be able to get through a day without needing a huge nap?  

There's no way I'm discussing this with my doctor and my therapist is on a leave of absence for her own health reasons.  I've built a good relationship with her and I don't really want to start that over with someone new quite yet.  I've looked into SMART recovery but haven't reached out to them yet.  I'm really just interested in hearing from y'all right now.

I finally stopped as I moved across state with my girl, got a nice job, and live in a decent area. So given that and the fact that I'm only 20, I consider myself very lucky. However this is the longest I've been clean in a year. The constant low energy, low mood, and lack of interest in just about everything is making the day to day long and painful. I do get some good days here and there though. Video games don't interest me, watching YouTube or shows don't interest me, music barely holds my interest, even sex seems like too much work for too little payoff and my libido is on the low side. My girl is being supportive and trying her best to help me, but there's only so much she can do. I'm currently waiting for my insurance to kick in from this job in about a month or 2 so I can hopefully get put back on an antidepressant but until then I don't know how to make each day somewhat enjoyable. I get home from a painfully long day at work, try to play some video games or watch some TV only to get sick of forcing myself to be entertained after the 5 minutes of enjoyment wear off, and then I just put some music in the background until I fall asleep for the next day. Which I'm sure my girl enjoys too /so.
I want to just experience some excitement and energy and drive again to a point where I'm fighting myself on getting a certain OTC cotton since I (thankfully) don't have any connects in my new area.

I've been doing great lately,   and can't even remember the last time I had a strong craving.

I hit a real rough patch recently and got very depressed and basicly stopped eating,  (I'm doing better  now though luckily)   and even after that, I didn't feel tempted to binge on stims. I've also been more prone to psychotic symptoms for a while, which is also starting to become less of an issue as time goes by, with the exception of mood episodes like depression/mania.

What has made the biggest difference, for me,  is daily exercise, and daily cooking. Cooking my own (healthy) food makes me feel very productive, and most importantly it makes me feel like I'm in control of myself. I've noticed that once I'm always ordering take out, I've already given up on self control and I'm only one step away from binging on stimulants. The same is true for smoking weed, which is why I've almost completely stopped smoking weed. It's not as important to me as stopping stimulants, so once in a while I let myself smoke but basicly, just like ordering take out, for me (frequently) smoking weed is a signal to myself that I don't care about discipline and self control.

Daily exercise has helped with my confidence, my energy , my discipline and my motivation. I don't even do anything intense, I just walk daily, and recenly I've added a small workout onto my daily walk.

I've been taking LSD once in a while and it helps me a lot mentally, and with suppressing cravings. I'm not sure why,  and I understand that for others it might not be beneficial or it might be a gateway to using different drugs. But to me it has been therapeutic and a mood boost.

I hope everyone here is doing okay, and if you've recently used, not to feel too down. Remember that failing / giving in once does not mean you have to give up completely. Good luck to everyone.",10,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9700931310653687}"

We divorced 6 years ago on good terms & she is a fantastic woman who I admire a great deal.

Shortly after we separated I began my 6 year love affair with meth & so never really grieved over the loss as the meth blocked out all of the pain & grief I should have felt.

I still and have always found her attractive but the importance of our relationship now is far more important than ruining it with unwanted advances.

I purchased a car in the city she lives in & she let me stay with her for about 5 days.

I have been off meth for 9 weeks & been doing ok but am at my lowest, basically a mess. It was a good few days & we enjoyed each other's company.

Last night was the last night & out of nowhere I became an emotional wreck.
I cried in front of her, asked her if there was a chance we could get back together even though I knew there was none & generally made her, a woman I care a great deal about, very uncomfortable after she welcomed me into her home.

It came out of nowhere & a day later I cannot stop crying & it's embarrassing because I am supposed to be on a driving holiday with my dad & out of nowhere there is this massive hole in my heart that before this weekend was not there.

I am so confused & I messaged her a bunch of times today & find it's compulsive the more she pushes away.

1yr+ clean. Slowly getting back on feet.  car accident,, eviction, job loss, abusive relationship, and started methamphetamine usage all within one year of each other. within 2 years was kicked out and homeless.

Anyway, it was my abuser who introduced me to methamphetamine. He's been doing it for the last 25 years. He lives in the Bible Belt middle of nowhere making a California salary for software development working out of his home which is a trap house. He sprinkled meth all over town he's the meth runner for his whole little town. Money is no object to him. He's never successfully quit and I don't believe he ever really tried. He never had a breakdown on it like I did. He kept his job friends and family house and car is just fine all this time. But I collapsed into failure. Why do I have to be the poster child for don't do drugs? When is he going to get his comeuppance? He hasn't seemed to suffer a single consequence. He has the attitude that if he had never dated a non meth user we never would have had any drama.  But the psychological and Financial  and emotional abuse didn't come until after I discovered he was a meth user and it got so bad that I just started using myself so that I could fit in and be accepted by them. And I'm the one who suffered. Why isn't anything bad happening to him? He already owns two vehicles and he bought a pickup truck just to blend in with the locals on his run to the city. And I'm paying a mechanic $700 to move a car that they can't get running because I don't own the title because I f***** my life up anyway it's a long story but anyway I'm just like I was a user for 2 years.

But meth was the one that got me, even over benzos. That one time turned into one last time. Little did I know, there is many last times.

Meth turned into a every weekend thing then quickly went to a daily thing. I was lying to myself telling myself that I could quit anytime I wanted. I got married at 18 before the meth came to my high school sweetheart and I am still currently with her at 21.

But by 19, I was having sex with all kinds of people, doing disgusting, unspeakable things that actually felt good on meth, as in I was a sick fucking tweaker that was basically falling into some kind of sex addiction. It was pathetic and I hated myself sober but meth would make me feel less bad about myself and keep repeating these disgusting things. I was oblivious to who I really was because meth made me look good in my eyes. But then again, every thing looked good on meth. 

My wife and I had three ways, I cheated on her behind her back while she was pregnant. I was a true worthless scumbag. The sad part of it all is I grew up as kid telling myself I'll never be that ""guy"". I'll never be a drug addict, I'll never be a cheater, etc. And I failed myself. At one point, I even took my gun and pulled the trigger but the safety was on and here I am today still alive. Then my wife divorced me.

Getting heartbroken and divorced at 20 was extremely emotionally painful. And while it was a sad time, it made me mature a bit quicker. Trust me, I wish I was able to be that immature teenager but I missed the part of my life because of meth. I was in denial about my addiction.

One day I bought an ounce, went home, and just straight up flushed it. I felt amazing after that! While I threw away money, I don't see it that way at all. Money can be replaced by hard work. Something other people dont realize tbh. Getting a job isnt hard when you have motivation guiding you.

So here I am with three years of my life wasted with a crippling meth addiction. But then one day I decided to eat healthy and try working out for a week. When I mean work out, I mean HARD work outs. I was doing 500 push ups a day and while that sounds like total BS, it's TRUE. Trust me, I was sore as fuck. But I got a literal high from working out. I was also running a mile a day and doing tons of crunches. Often people referred to it as the ""runners high"".

Then I stuck with this workout routine for 6 months with no drugs other than weed and phenibut. I developed a panic disorder after meth use for some reason and phenibut helps that. The weed helped working out be more enjoyable. I even worked overtime at my job. I was getting ripped and working hard for cash.

Through the heartbreak, humility, suicide attempts, panic attacks, I felt like a fucking warrior. A goddamn gladiator if you will. The confidence I built up was astonishing! I learned that loving myself was the key to happiness! Because without out self care, you can never truly be happy.

In this time of working on myself, my wife and daughter actually came back to me. She saw that I was sober and truly doing good for myself. She didnt care about my money or anything of material possession, but she still loved me and wanted me to do better before we settled down. So I got remarried and have a loving family now. 

But one day, recently, I blacked out xanax hanging out with an old addict friend and ended up with meth that I still have no idea how I got. Like it fell from the sky. Please note I havnet used xanax in awhile. It was just a black out after drinking a few beers on half a xan.

And I've had it for about a month now but still haven't touched it. I'm not sure what to do with it. I dont crave it, I don't need it. I keep telling myself I'll use when I party one day, but yet haven't used it yet because the fear of falling back into addiction. 

I'm happy now, but meth is in my dreams. Very vivd dreams of me doing tons of it then waking up in disappointment because it was just a dream. It haunts me and taunts me. Screaming at me! Like the devil on my shoulder whispering in my ear.

Can I call this true sobriety? Am I truly on the right path? I got everything I need. A family, a house, a healthy body, a beautiful baby girl. But there is something missing. Just a feeling within that something isn't whole. And I have yet to discover that thing.

I used drugs to hide my depression. Meth numbed any sadness I had within me. Completely void of feeling any pain. But it wasnt real. It was synthetic happiness. Because I have now experienced true happiness for what it really is.

I conquered my meth addiction and obtained a warrior mindset in it all. Self confidence was the key. 
But something is still missing within. And I feel like it always will.",14,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.8876276016235352}"
