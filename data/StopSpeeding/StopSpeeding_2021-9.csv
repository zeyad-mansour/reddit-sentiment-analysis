My mom and I settled on Vyvanse for a few reasons: 1. Extended release: I could take it before school and wouldn't have to remember to take another pill, while still having the effects last long enough to do homework. 2. My family doctor at the time said I could take it asynchronously - if I had an ""important"" day ahead like tests, lots of homework. We ended up settling on a 30 mg dose, and it worked for me for years. I'd take it when I ""needed"" it, because I was fine with my ADHD symptoms on the average day, and Vyvanse sometimes felt very speedy/weird - albeit very helpful.

Fast forward to around this time last year: first-year university student, pandemic caused classes to move online, and I was already way behind in most. I started taking my 30 mg every day in order to catch up on classes (ended up dropping 2/3 of them..lol) and *drinking Redbull*. At the time I didn't know the long-term risks of mixing the two and ended up getting hooked on the Redbull + Vyvanse induced ""Limitless"" feeling. I started working a summer job doing lawn mowing/physically intense labor and kept taking 30 mg and drinking 1-2 Redbulls a day. Honestly never really felt terrible over the summer, it was actually the best I've ever felt productivity-wise (duh) and I could sleep easily, probably because I was using up my energy and drinking a ton of water. At a certain point I felt like the Vyvanse wasn't giving me the same good feeling and I was crashing earlier so I started taking 2 pills. It was good until it was....not...and I went to a walk-in doctor who upped my dose to 40 mg. I took only 1 a day until it *still* felt like it wasn't ""working"" and then *started taking 80 mg* on certain days.

Once classes started again (online still) and I got a job working at a hardware type store, I kept taking 2 pills and drinking 1-2 Redbulls - until I started getting heart palpitations and went to the ER. I've now gone to the ER twice and both times they've told me I'm healthy, but that I should not be doubling my dose. I go through phases where I'm determined to tone it down but then I have days where I feel like a zombie and then I go back to taking 2 pills or splitting a second pill in half. I’ve tried Adderall, Concerta….supplements…med breaks..

I feel like I'm stuck in a loop. I feel shame and physical exhaustion when I put all this stress on my body, but without the little rush of stims I feel my executive dysfunction kick in hard. It affects my sleep and I get a ton of other side effects and lately a lot of arrythmia/circulation problems/shakiness. I want to feel productive without sacrificing my overall wellbeing but I have school and work. It’s my understanding that it’s almost impossible to go back to taking Vyvanse as directed or on ""important' days? All I know is that my body is tired and I'm stressed. I just want to put life on pause and let someone else take the reins. I started out with SUCH good intentions!!!",10

I used daily for a few years and decided to get Sober. 

Anyways, after a relapse I will feel terrible for weeks after and everything will drag literally for months.  I will not have any motivation, cannot think for myself etc.  The thing is this last time I slipped was 13 days ago and I used for 4 days after.   The difference this time was I had those ensure meal replacement drinks, I took vitamins and I had something for the comedowns.  I also start tinkering with a research chemical named 9mebc.  This chemical had created new dopamine pathways in rats that were drug addicted.  

So it's been over a week and I feel identical to how I felt prior to relapsing.  I didn't feel unmotivated I felt the opposite.  I actually had to stop drinking caffeine because of the anxiety it was giving me.  

Is it possible that the research chemical along with my vitamin supplementation helped my brain to rebound extremely quick?  So quickly that I had to completely cut caffeine out of my life due to anxiety?

Literally over a month ago i was bitching to a friend also in my same shoes about the lack of motivation and he also felt hopeless.  All of a sudden I started taking that research chemical and feel rebounded even after a relapse.

Since some people are curious of my stack.

I have a problem.","I’m a 28 year old woman. I went through all of school undiagnosed. I was tested for a learning disability as a child and they said that I’m actually pretty intelligent, but that I don’t like math. LMAO. The audacity. Anyway, I tried adderall briefly in high school, but it didn’t seem to be helping, so I got back on the struggle bus, went to college and dropped out because I couldn’t handle it. 

I then went on to work a series of mind numbing corporate jobs and things got so difficult for me that I decided to seek help again. I went to a psychiatrist who prescribed me focalin. I started out great, then eventually I found myself doubling and tripling the dose and sometimes even staying awake for 2-3 days at a time. It doesn’t even feel GOOD. It feels awful. But I kept eating those pills like candy. And here I am after a 2 day binge. It actually got worse when I started working from home because it was easier to coast by without having to look and act presentable in an office. 

I felt compelled to post this because I see so many people acting like stimulants are THEE solution for ADHD, getting so pissed at doctors and sometimes even other patients when they want to discuss the risks of addiction. “Oh you can’t get addicted if you have ADHD, it’s almost impossible.” Lol well, bullshit. I think they can be a good tool if used sparingly, but people like you and I can’t do that, and we need to be realistic about it. It would be nice for those mornings when I’m chronically fatigued and I just can’t get moving, but I don’t think that’s an option for me.

I eat like a normal person I sleep like a normal person you would never tell that I was using but I want to stop for my own mind body and soul and I feel like my body at this point is so dependent and my brain is so fucked up because I’ve been on it for so long (30mg time capsules since 1997) I feel like I have no hope for ever not being on drugs and I know it’s gonna take some serious medical attention to even figure out and I don’t have any type of money like that to figure out what is exactly wrong with me.

The worst thing as also gaining more weight as I used to be obese since I was 5 years old. I try to control my consumption now as I love being productive and full of energy and motivation.

I’m making this post to hopefully show people that it’s possible to quit and get through the withdrawals. I was using meth for just over a year, and I got to the point where I was using about a half a gram every 24 hours. 

Where I live that was costing me $300 each time, so just being clean for 16 days means I’ve saved (or not spent) $3387. 

I use an app on my phone to track my progress, I find that helps keeping me motivated. 

And since I’m not spending all of my money on drugs I’m able to reward myself by buying some nice things like new clothes, or ordering from a fancier restaurant with Uber Eats, or trying out new flavours of nicotine juice for my vape. 

This action of treating myself is self-reinforcing, and makes me feel good. Being kind to yourself during recovery is so important. 

I go out every day even if it’s just on a bus into the city where I can walk around among lots of people. It’s so much better than being hi all the time and confined to my room. 

I got a thought in my head today that was just like: “you should be proud of yourself.” It was just a fleeting thought but it felt nice. 

If you’d asked me a month ago whether I could quit using I would have said no. For so long I didn’t believe I could care about wanting to live again. 

The main reason I started smoking was to help hide grief I was feeling over the loss of my mother in late 2019. 

Now I’m dealing with that in a healthier way. Yesterday I saw my psychiatrist. He said this was the best he’d ever seen me. 

The main reason I was able to quit was that my dealer wasn’t getting back to me for 2 days and by that time I was half way through the really intense comedown that I thought fuck it, I may as-well see this through and see what happens and it worked. 

The only “negative” thing I’m noticing is that I’m always hungry and eating and I’m gaining quite a lot of weight. Still, I’d rather be a bit overweight and sober than high and becoming gaunt.

Im gonna remove myself from all relevant subs and try to resist any temptations in the future. Its gonna be really fucking hard i know because after a few weeks i tend to stop caring as much or more appropriately, i lose the drive and power i once had.

if anyone has any good tips / resources please send them last time

last time i said that it was that only gonna be a break for a few months. this time, this is the end of my 4mmc use. This drug has proved time and time again you cant just use every now and again because the second that >!line goes up your nose!<, that's it.

i know my parents know, they're not dumb. they've seen the packages and the place i keep it was opened today after i got home from work. i know its hurting them but they wont say anything anymore.

my addict brain is already pissed off that i flushed it, but I've never took it so far to actually flush it but i needed to make a point to myself and actually take back some control of my health and life.

I've been sobbing all evening in secrecy all evening about this; i cant keep fucking doing this to myself and i have so many better things to be doing with my life besides getting high, feeling awful for the first half of my working week just to get back from my last work day and do it all over again.

2021-09-26 12:16:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/pvwy66/24_year_condensed_timeline_of_dexedrine_useabuse/,24 year condensed timeline of Dexedrine use/abuse and recovery through PAWS,"1. Early 90's prescribed Dexedrine 30 mg a day for adult ADHD. (Timeline actually covers about 28 years I guess. Recovery more like 22- 23) ) Definitely had the symptoms of lifelong ADHD along with depression and other psychological difficulties, including a mild form of bipolar and relatively minor drug abuse with a taste for opiates and occasional stims, though I managed to avoid addiction and to live and appear rather normal as a middle class college graduate who eventually got married, had a small business and a young child. In retro I had a lot to lose and not that much to gain from a risky relationship with a notoriously addictive drug.
2. I must have been sensitive to the effect of amphetamine as the effects of this moderate dose were rather dramatic. This was contemporaneous with a painful and psychologically destabilizing separation and eventual divorce. I was ostensibly on stims as a strat for saving my marriage by getting rid of the ADD symptoms my wife found EXTREMELY annoying. (turned out she was a grandiose narcissist and I took her ridicule on needlessly, ugh) But the separation proceeded anyway. This produced a psychological crisis for me.
3. upside - several years of overall good therapeutic effect - significant weight loss down to ideal weight, markedly increased focus, wellbeing, and anti-depressant effect.
4. downside - intolerable anxiety as drug wore off late in the day. Other classic stim side effects. My sense of well-being and self-confidence ranged into hypomania bordering on outright mania/megalomania in the form of unrealistic ideas about myself - thought maybe as a total amateur I could make a living as a great poet, just as one example. I held these ideas somewhat privately as I did not quite trust their reality - thankfully I was aware this all MIGHT be an amphetamine induced delusion and I better play it safe - I partially succeeded in keeping this to myself but it turned out it was more apparent to others than I realized. In retro I can now see it was a combo post-divorce crisis AND amphetamine induced effect.
5. stimfapping reared its ugly head - compulsive all-night porn/masturbation while bingeing through my prescription. Was able to reup early to keep it going in three month stretches until eventually I had to face several weeks without drug while waiting to get new prescription. Repeat process for at least two destructive years. ugh . . .
6. Severe post-binge depression and sleeplessness from the all night sessions led to the near complete collapse of mental health, my my small business and most social contact. I was isolating and ignoring responsibilities. This reached a hard bottom of undeniable and unacceptable damage to my life and as a bottom line I felt miserably depressed.
7. Misplaced a monthly prescription and was forced to endure full withdrawal and over a month of waiting to see doc again. Decided to take the opportunity to quit permanently and I did. This was late 98, maybe early 99, almost  six years in.
8. Six years of use/abuse now over I faced withdrawal and recovery - acute W/D was a few days of sleeping 15 hours a day, intense brain fog, etc Not too bad really.
9. The first month was interesting. I emerged after the first week feeling relatively confident and good. I felt some relief and fully expected the worst was over. All along this had been my backup plan I think - push stim use as far as I can and then pull out of the tailspin and get back to normal life.  But in that first month a dark cloud slowly descended. I began to face up to the reality of what I had done and felt growing shame and regret until it hit me ""WTF had I just done to myself and my life? There was no normal life to get back to. OMG. Lots of distressing and anxious thoughts intruded. I avoided social contact - this became crippling and I sank into a long dark depressing period. It hit me that this deep rut of mental fog and anguish MUST be the after effects of six years of stim abuse. Maybe on speed I would have had the self-confidence to push right through these self-doubts and lulls but I had none of that and speed no longer worked that way. I had almost no joy of living and what motivation I felt was crushed by the shame and self-loathing. But I had some faith this would eventually pass.
10. I began to slowly try to put the pieces of a broken life back together but most of the things I tried by way of making a living again failed because of my poor choices and self-defeating psychology.
11. Approximately a year later things are looking up. I'm working again, this time for an old friend, doing the same profession I had been self-employed  in before my fall. My friend was a recovering addict active in the 12 steps and also held a post-graduate degree in a mental health field - in retro I can working side by side with him for a few years he offered me a kind of informal therapy and served as a 12 step sponsor of sorts even though I never consciously embraced the 12 steps. I also picked up tennis as a hobby - lots of sun, exercise, and socialization for nearly 20 hours a week! I really think working again, earning my way, and the exercise and sun were HUGE in healing my psychology and my brain. Brain plasticity - in a single concept.
12. At some point in the first year or two of my recovery my brain ""lit up"" again. This was a revelation! After many months of no joy or enthusiasm at all I am driving along, listening to music. and a wave of happiness came over me - it was inexplicable, nothing had changed - if I had to put it into words it was like life TASTED good again, almost like a sugar high there was a real connection to my GUT, hence the sense of tasting life, just the idea of BEING, of having a life at all. I realized I had felt like that most all of the time before amphetamines - it felt the same - a flood of happy memories came back. There was a sweet sense of anticipation. Kind of like that feeling you get at work when you think ""when I get home and kick back with a video game and a diet Dew and that's gonna feel so good, yeah!"" And it did. The simple pleasures of a good game and a diet soda were actually engrossing, stimulating! Could it be, could it possibly be? had my brain reattuned itself to getting dopamine rewards from simple, wholesome life?
13. This feeling came and went but eventually it seemed to get stuck ""on"". The intense joy of it faded but that was a temporary contrast with the deep lows preceding - what replaced it was a steady sense of pleasure and purpose, of having a ""future"", I literally had a spring in my step, internally animated, pumped - kind of like normal human life really.
14. Steady improvement from here on. There was a clear and distinct feeling of being ""back"", largely free of PAWS. I had a one day relapse TEN YEARS later that failed immediately - the hangover and sense of being right back in the shit again was intense. NO WAY I was doing THAT again.
15. One last experience FWIW. Maybe six years into my recovery I was still plagued by occasional depression - mostly on weekends and holidays - one Thanksgiving day it got intense, so intense I decided to meditate out of sheer desperation. Shortly into my meditation (I had many years ago been deep into mantra  meditation) I had the thought ""oh, there's that immensely heavy lump of depression, right there in my chest, in the heart area, it hurts! But there it is I can feel it!"" At once I realized ""I"" was over here feeling the ""pain"" over there - more as a physical sensation than as a mood - in other words, as irrational as it may sound,  I felt separated from the pain, which was itself quite a relief. This was visceral, not wishful thinking or mood-making on an IDEA of being separate from the pain -  quite naturally and effortlessly I began to think the mantra and feel the lump of depression on my chest at the same time, as if I were thinking the mantra ""in my heart"". Amazingly the lump began to shrink, and shrink, and then ""poof"" it was gone! Replacing it was a fucking warm glow, a 180 reversal, full transcendence in the sense that I still had a heavy holiday feeling that was bitter-sweet but now mostly sweet, not bitter. The feeling was equally intense but the tenor of the mood was flipped - the meta-interpretation had changed, if that makes any sense. When I emerged the depression was mostly gone! What a miraculous relief! Something had clicked in my brain. I honestly think a brain pathway came back to life. I have no other explanation for such a sudden reversal. That particular heavy depression NEVER came back. Brain plasticity is real - you need to reawaken the old pathways. That's all I got. Happy to field any questions or comments.",39

We’ve talked in the past few weeks and he knows I know he’s using still; I told him I would rather he tell me than I just found out and last night I walked in on him loading his goddamn pipe. Just a quick bashful “oh, heyyy” and no real discussion, no real remorse. He’s making less and less sense when we talk and he’s like not understanding what I say - simple things, very basic explanations of something that happened in my day and he’s just not able to get it. Yesterday I had a package that was clearly labeled as a subscription box I had and he was like “oh, I thought it was Amazon?  It’s a random assortment of things, that’s really cool” like we’d never even talked about it before.  And when we talk about our issues it’s my communication, or my eating disorder, that need to be addressed first - not the drug that’s literally eating his brain and turning him into someone I can’t at all recognize. 

I don’t want to give him an ultimatum because I know first hand they rarely work. But I need to get him to fucking stop and I don’t know how without taking nuclear measures.",9

I’m diagnosed with ADHD and have been taking dexedrine spansule 15mg every weekday for about 2 years. I find the side affects pretty frustrating so I’ve never felt the urge to take more than prescribed, plus it doesn’t get me high/spun out/anxious or anything just helps me focus more.

However I can have a fairly addictive personality and enjoy drinking and smoking weed but I’ve almost always done it socially or to get me to sleep. I took a week long t break because I noticed my weed tolerance going up. in an utterly dumb lapse of judgement I decided to reward the end of the break with smoking a few bowls, having a few glasses of whisky, and some of my brother’s old vyvanse.

I ended up overamping. I experienced psychosis and hallucinations, had a panic attack, almost killed myself, and possibly had serotonin syndrome (showed all the symptoms except diarrhea and passing out). That was when the little lucid part of me fully realized what I was getting myself into by doing this to myself. This shit really can kill me and with the way I am right now I’m perfectly capable of doing it myself. In recent months, I’ve noticed an urge for something stronger than weed and alcohol but have always ignored it. When school, work, relationship responsibilities etc. started piling on at the start of September, the intensity, length, and frequency of this urge dramatically increased. I had finally satisfied that urge by taking myself to the worst place imaginable and getting the highest I would ever wanna get. The clarity I felt that night and day after affected me more than any psa campaign, lecture, therapy session, and threat could ever. I came out of it with a completely different attitude towards drugs and never want to experience that ever again. I flushed the excess vyvanse and I’ll avoid weed and alcohol for a bit because of my current headspace.

I still have my dexedrine script that I need to take though. When I’m off it, I feel lethargic, distracted, and impulsive. I took my normal dose two days after my overamp and felt alright (although the comedown from the vyvanse was hell). Should I err on the side of caution and not take it? Or go with my gut and continue taking my dexedrine?",8

It's a pretty awful feeling tbh because I try to run away from it and not think about it, to avoid the anxiety, but that only makes me think about it more. The positive side is that it's really discouraging me to make me want to use.

But sadly I also know that this feeling never lasts forever, once I get the idea in my head that I want to binge again,  the anxiety goes away and I just get really excited when I think about it.

I had a ton of energy and was really surprised by that, I attributed it to the vitamins I’d been taking. Then I had some drinks and found 10mg and popped it before I could convince myself not to. That was a couple days ago and since then I have been seriously dragging ass, super tired and lethargic. I thought I’d bounce right back but I haven’t.


Can that small of a dose really set me back that much in my recovery or is it more likely the drinks and staying up a little later that night that is causing me to feel like ass? Or maybe work has just been more mentally demanding since that day... I started feeling like I can’t do this today, that I need my adderall back.


If anyone has testimony on how a relapse can impact a quitting effort, I’d be interested to hear it. Thanks!",3

Over the past 6 days more days I’ve started to return to a point where I feel almost back to normal, maybe 75%. My hunger has come back with a vengeance, and honestly I’m loving eating big meals multiple times a day. I’m getting 8-9 hours of sleep every night and go to sleep at around 11pm so that I can wake up and experience the mornings, afternoons and evenings. 

One thing that’s quite jarring is just how slow time passes, or at least my perception of time. And I look back on a year of using Meth and to me it only felt like a couple of months. 

I’m not gonna lie the thoughts of getting hi enter my brain, but every time that happens I read over a list of reasons why I quit and then find something else to do to distract myself instead like watching Netflix or looking for new music to listen to. 

I know some of you advised me against vaping nicotine and that it’s a gateway to meth but I was a smoker/vaper long before I got hooked on meth, so I doubt it will negatively affect my goals. I basically vape as a substitute, and I believe that that helps me. 

When I was using meth I would be awake for 3 days most of the time, and then take one of my prescribed anti-psychotics to knock me out cold. (I’m Bipolar type 1). But a few times I was awake for 6 or 7 days and during one of those periods I started to hear voices, one male and one female, but instead of being freaked out by them I took them as my subconscious mind speaking to me and wrote down what they were saying. Those and my private journal entities from that time are so jarring to read now that my mind is more or less back to normal. 

Bring on day 12

&nbsp;

The Vyvanse was helping me get stuff done at work, so I thought it had ""fixed"" me. But the truth is, now that I've taken a step back, I see I am as disorganized as ever. I never learned to prioritize properly or manage my time. When I could rely on Vyvanse, I could make something my singular focus and binge through it. Who cares if my other priorities fall to the wayside, as long as I am getting this one thing done? 

&nbsp;

This allowed me to excel at certain tasks, and sometimes look good at work — but, far from helping me reach a normal baseline, the Vyvanse made me into a productivity maniac. Instead of learning coping skills to make smart decisions about what to do and why, it allowed me to keep a childlike all-or-nothing mentality. If I had a presentation due, I would do NOTHING but work on that presentation for the days and nights leading up to it. I was literally working more, but was I working smarter or better? 

&nbsp;

This week, now that I've gotten through the worst of early withdrawal, I have been setting up organizational systems like Bullet Journaling and time planning. I never felt I ""needed"" them before, because I was so capable of brute forcing my way through tasks with artificial dopamine boosts. Although I still think it will be extremely hard for me to stay focused and productive without any medication, I am kind of excited about learning to be a real adult and developing intelligent coping skills.

I would like to go cold turkey and not taper off. The issue is I work in research so I always gotta be on top of my game, and I’m still waiting for med school interviews and other shit that will require maximum cognitive performance, therefore why I want maximum and accelerated recovery.

I’ve gone done lost everything and gained it all back several times before but I’m no longer willing to lose like this and after so many times, some of what I would lose might not be willing to come back anymore. So here’s day one. Gotta work on Monday and already know my level of productivity is gonna be shit but after the third or fourth day, I’ll be fine. Yea… if it were as easy as that, I’d be just fine. But I guess I wanna put myself through a little discomfort. I wanna show myself how much power in my will I have over most any fucking thing that demands me to be less. I’ll let you know how fucked up it gets but for now, cheering this bottle of water as I chug down some vitamins.",9

Either my tolerance was way too high or the stuff that I’m being given by my dealer sucks. That and the time in between him being able to get me more stuff opened up a window of opportunity for me to suffer in the short term to reach a point where I can say I’m done with this stuff. 

Days 1-3 were hell, it often felt like my whole body was being squished by something or that I’d been hit by a truck. I guess 12 months of sitting in awkward positions for hours and smoking stimulants deserved that reaction from my body. 

Day 4 was okay, I was able to get out and walk to the supermarket and back and began to get more social with the people I live with, which is a change, I isolate and go quiet and watch adult movies when I’m hi and I was hi almost all the time almost every day. 

Day 5 is today and I rewarded myself by buying a new vape pen and some nicotine juice to help me with cravings. It’s nice to sit on a bus and not feel frazzled or out of it like I used to, but to just take in my surroundings and write this all down. 

I downloaded an app that tracks days I’ve quit for and how much money I have saved (over $1000 so far I was spending wayyyyy too much money on shit that made me feel like a ghost in my own life). 

My biggest challenge in life now is finding things to do with my time, boredom is the quickest way back to stims in my experience so I need to work on that. 

Just thought I’d post this so other people who are reading can see there is hope in all of us to quit you just have to find the right moment and then tell yourself the withdrawals are shit, but they’re good for you, and you should be proud of yourself while coming down that you’re reaching a point of taking back control of your life. 

I wish you all the best. ❤️",22

He's been to prison multiple times and I just found out he's going back again. We have been on and off for 7 years. Sadly some of our happiest times have been when he was in prison because he was off the drugs, he is such a smart, caring, passionate, funny person naturally. Every time he gets out it never takes more than a few months for him to start using again and when he gets high he just doesn't care about anything, won't hold down a job, and treats me like shit if he bothers to contact me at all.

We don't live together and i hadn't seen him in a while. Anyway I ended up spending last weekend with him and he just kept going back and forth between kissing me and holding my hand, to just going off on me for the smallest things, calling me stupid, a liar, so much awful stuff. I've been through this with him before and I refuse to do it again.

He's disappeared again, but if he pops back up I'm going to let him know that I'm breaking things off as long as he keeps living this way. And I know that by doing this I'm ensuring that I'll probably never hear from him again, because he has no desire to do anything but get high and commit crimes. Doesn't want a relationship or a career or anything but this insane lifestyle. I'm not writing or visiting him when he goes to prison either.

Problem is, I still love him with every fiber of my being. I can't imagine my life without him. I've been crying for two days. It hurts sooo much. I love him so fucking much. When he's clean off drugs, he's my rock. He's the first person I want to share with when something good happens. He's the first person I'd go to if I was upset. He made me feel beautiful, and when things were going well I always did so much better at work because he made me feel so confident. It's terrifying to think of never experiencing any of that again. Idk yall, I just need support. And if anybody here has been in his position and has any insight you could give me, I'd really appreciate it. I can't stop crying.",29

It will still be a wait until my first appointment so the focus until then is staying strong and sober. But I’m already off work for the week due to a horrendous weekend that landed me in hospital and stitched up following a suicide attempt.

I'm looking for advice on how to recover and quit this medication permanently.,"Using a throwaway because I'm super ashamed, embarrassed and scared about this but I need help.

I'm prescribed 50mg Vyvanse and was previously prescribed 45mg of Adderall (IR). I asked to be switched to Vyvanse because I thought it would be easier to control myself (obviously not what I told my doctor). Long story short, I'm just as bad with the Vyvanse as I was with Adderall. It doesn't even make feel good or anything yet I have this strong desire to take it (and more and more).

I usually binge my prescription over the course of a week/week and a half then wait until it's time to refill. I don't get it from other sources or do it consistently. I have legitimate ADHD and the first day of a binge I function better than I do without meds, it's a decline from there though as I take more and go without sleep or food.

This most recent binge has me feeling awful, probably the worst I've experienced with Vyvanse. I'm wondering if anyone has advice on how to manage the comedown and recover from it in general? I'm also wondering about how to go about stopping this disgusting behavior while managing ADHD? Can someone realistically get past addiction/binging and take stimulants as prescribed?

If it helps, I have klonopin (.5mg), aspirin, and a low dose blood pressure medication. I also have a relative willing to give me a few xanax (1mg) if needed. I'm drinking a lot of water but I still can't eat. I feel tired and stimulated at the same time, I'm anxious, full of guilt and shame. I can't stop thinking about how stupid and fucked up of a person I am. I know that mindset isn't going to help but I can't seem to break out of it.

I would really appreciate any advice or insights.

edit: I take 100-150mg at a time and redose anywhere from 8 to 16 hours later (sometimes longer), occasionally I take a 50mg dose sometime between the big doses because I think I don't feel it enough or tell myself it will make me feel better/improve my mood (which it never does).",12

I started a low dose of 5mg of Adderall XR a few months ago and immediately noticed improvements in focus attention planning ef functions etc etc. All was fine until I started getting migraines. I'm prone to migraines but they would occur after dosage so I knew there was a causal effect. 

The thing that really made me worry was when I flew the other day I got a horrible sharp pain in my left temple. I thought I was dying and would get a stroke or an aneurysm or something. It happened two times both on descent. And I never had this before. 

I decided to stop and today I had the worst day ever. I felt restless and had tons of anxiety and crazy mood swings. Also my ADD came back and so I felt super unproductive. 

I'm thinking I should taper down and skip everyother day or something? Idk if you can get lower than 5 mgs. I'm super light weight I know but my doc knew I was hesitant and I'm honestly pretty mild.

I know yesterday I said day 6, but I realized it’s Monday today. And last Monday was when I started.

Struggled this morning. Woke up around 6am, took a nap 9am-11am, woke up pissed and lonely. Tried to cuddle the dog but she’s a cunt that only wants food. Think maybe I’ll start a Facebook account now that I’ve moved away from everyone. I haven’t had a Facebook in 6 or 7 years.  I considered using stickers to reinforce doing tasks, just like how my mom potty trained me. also, I considered maybe I can let myself become pathetic again like I was in elementary school and letting myself replace my need for friendship with stickers or RPG characters. Dark times call for drastic measures.  I don’t mind letting myself just fucking lose it.  Some of the stickers I have are really cute animals, though, and my stupid bitch corgi doesn’t want cuddles. Fucking bitch. Literally. Unfortunately I couldn’t find my damn stickers. Watched a bunch of 30 Rock. I’m almost done with it. Put three pieces into a puzzle. Smoked half a joint. Got real lazy. Played Mario. Weed+Video games = postponed suicidal urges. I didn’t throw anything today. 

I did find a bunch of ephedrine I bought like, 3 years ago, with the intent to make into meth somehow, back when my ex-side piece Jonny was still alive. (He ODed January 5th, so I pretty much didn’t care about the capitol riots). Jonny was supposed to teach me how to cook. That was initially the whole purpose of letting him into my inner circle in the first place but it never ended up happening. Think he was trying to protect me. 

Anywho, took like, 7 of the 12.5mg ephedrine tablets. No joke, shit kind of helped. Just feeling that bronchial dilation, even if it’s some placebo shit. I didn’t think it was legal to sell, but it was at some Walgreens in Chinatown in Boston circa 2018.
So I got my basic ass goals done. I shaved a little bit of my vagina, the patch that was irritating my clit, and one leg. And shampooed a quadrant of my head. There’s too much hair to do all that crap all at once. 

My main goals were to empty the dishwasher from last night, clean the dishes from last nights dinner and then cook dinner for my bf. Did all three. Fuck ya.

Last time I cold turkied it was off Vyvanse and without weed. I was doing it the NA way. Set up for failure all or nothing bullshit. The main issue was the suicidal ideation was constant. If only I had smoked the occasional weed I might have not thrown that six months away. 
No offense to any 12 steppers. That shit helped with some stuff, back when it did. Way back before I really knew what dependency was. 


So today’s success was brought to me by this combo

Ephedrine + weed + videogames = day 8.

I thought I had 10 full days, and I’ll get my refill the 17th, so i guess I have until Friday? Sometimes I can get it two days ahead. It depends on how difficult Walgreens wants to be this month.
 
I got to hope that at least my tolerance will go down, a little, right? I’m sorry but I’m not in for the long haul. I have to start working 60 hour weeks again next Monday, and 715 more days off is not in store for this adderallic of 20 goddamn years- almost. My first taste was at a Worcester palladium show New Year’s Eve 2001. I had just turned 15, two weeks before. Crazy how fast time runs, and how many years addiction steals",7

At the moment he's deep in the throes of acute withdrawals/crashing so depressed, sleeping a lot, etc. He's detoxing off of speed so he can get into ibogaine treatment in a couple days and I was just curious if you guys had any recommendations for things that might help over the next couple days?

But then I freaked out, thinking  ""so this week is my last chance to do it? would be a waste not to use that last chance"",  as if the only reason I'm not trying to do it is for other people:  the harsh reality that I somehow literally can't remember every time I make the decision to binge is that I don't even enjoy binging. It's a scary, confusing, and honestly sometimes traumatizing experience. Sometimes I wonder how I never had to go to the hospital, because in that state of mind I am not capable at all of taking care of myself, you easily spend 12 hours doing the same task in the same position only to realize afterwards all your muscles ache and that you're extremely dehydrated. And the way the doses have escalated... I thought since there were a good few weeks between the last binge and this one, my tolerance would be down or something. Well actually I think it was,  it's just that feeling everything isn't enough for me. It has to be even more for some reason.

To make things worse, this year I've ""graduated""  from 'normal'  stim binges to entactogen (mdma and other serotonin releasers ) binges. And god is it much much worse. The after effects are so bad and making my mood fluctuate like crazy. Also they just don't work well as something binged, the feeling of actually rolling never lasts more than around 5 hours, no matter how much you take or how late you take more,   there's definitely still a feeling in the next doses but it's not at all what it was before. And every consequetive dose puts more and more strain on my body, to the point where I feel physically sick and somehow I still force myself to take one more. The binges themself are scary, I completely loose track of time and become so hyperfocused on stuff like music that I'm basically not conscious,  8 hours will have gone by in what felt like a second. And that's why it always turns into a binge:  I take it, suddenly it's over,  and I wasted all my time doing nothing (or so I think at least)  sooo I think I need to take just onnne more and then I can really enjoy my time. I try not to even think about the dosages I've used because it literally scares me. Coupled with the not taking care of my body I could have easily put my life in danger. Which makes me feel stupid. Somehow I thought I wanted this. But I truly don't. Not even just for the parts that are euphoric, it's just so unnatural and forced and adds no value to my life. It's like eating pure sugar:  it's sweet but it's meaningless without other ingredients.

Anyway this is just me venting because I'll go crazy keeping all this in. I am definitely telling my therapist but not my SO and friends.. Firstly because I'm ashamed, but also because I know it will make them worry and I really do truly think that my chances of quitting will be much much higher as soon as I get specialized addiction care.",19

And I was talking him out of it saying, bro whatever party drugs you do, doing those for a week would still be less bad than doing this once, and it will take a week to recover. And it will ruin your life. Him thinking about it and being disbelieving that it would be that bad. Then I woke up

There's still times I wake up having using in my dreams but it's always accompanied by the relief that I didn't, and I'm still on my recovery journey even if I still have cravings. I usually reaffirm that I don't want it anymore. Does anyone have any advice for dealing with cravings in these situations?",6

With the permission of the moderators, I am posting this request.

My name is Susie Bennett, and I am a researcher at the University of Glasgow. Through my work I look to understand male suicide risk and recovery factors better. As some of you may know too well, male suicide is the biggest killer of men under 50 in Britain, and according to the Samaritan’s three-quarters of all suicides in 2018 were male. Having seen people I love experience these feelings, I wanted to build a greater understanding of what causes suicidal feelings and behaviours in men and what more can be done to help.

I have developed a survey to explore some of these issues. The survey takes 30 minutes to complete and covers topics including childhood experiences, self-esteem, connection with others and mental pain as well as suicidal feelings. Even if you have never had suicidal thoughts or feelings before, your answers would still give me valuable insights.

The survey is open to all men 18 and over, located anywhere. The more men I can get to complete the survey, the stronger my analysis can be, so please do share this post and details with friends, family, colleagues, community groups, or drop me a message if you know a way I could help get it out to more people. Your support would be greatly appreciated.

Here is the survey link: [https://glasgow-research.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/men](https://glasgow-research.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/men)

Please do let me know if you have any questions and please do complete the survey if you feel moved to or share this post if appropriate.

Many thanks, everyone,

However, one thing that helps me, is I think back to my acid trips and it just gives me a wave of serenity. It's like my way of dealing with my obsession with drugs is to change it to another drug.

I figured it was probably time to kick the can & call it quits as I’ve had issues with addiction in the past, although not specifically with Vyvanse.  

My question is: how do you guys even find the motivation to eat, or do anything for that matter, after quitting?  I took time off of work specifically for this, but I sleep at least 16 hours a day & I’m so depressed that even when I’m awake I don’t leave my bed.  People always talk about voracious appetite & gaining weight back, but food doesn’t even taste good.  Nothing seems to matter anymore.  I’m not suicidal or in danger by any stretch, but I have to actively force myself to even shower or brush my teeth. 

For context I quit 3 days ago & I’d been on my Vyvanse regiment for 2 and a half years, give or take a few months.  Just looking for some tips/tricks to make this more bearable.  I’d like to avoid any other substances at this time, but I guess I’m not above trying nootropics if it comes to that.

I have never posted anything like this but seeking some support or advice. I have a long history of mild to moderate depression. It began around the age 12. Grew up in a very dysfunctional family with mental health disorders and alcoholism. Anyways, I moved out when I was 17 and went to college. I think the excitement of college got me through the first semester but then my lethargy and lack of motivation creeped up again. This has always been a constant battle, along with losing things and being unorganized. So I went to see a psychologist/psychiatrist at age 19 who diagnosed me with ADHD (which I truly believe I have). Anyways I started taking prescribed stimulants and don’t think I would have made it through college without them. Now I’m 32 and am still taking them. I have never been able to really function without them. I’m totally dependent on them and feel like I can’t go one day without. I have 2 young children and no family support. I do have a husband who is a great guy but does lack patience and mental health understanding. I have tried to take less but then some days I just can’t get through the day. I’m in my last semester of grad school so I know it’s probably not the best time to try and wean off of them. I guess I turned to this forum because I’m at a loss of what to do. I wouldn’t mind laying in bed and lounging around but I don’t feel like that is ever an option when you have 2 kids who depend on you and a job. I have even considered rehab. Although I do take my prescription as prescribed and don’t take the medication to get high but I still feel like this is a major life issue with no end in sight. I also think I’m more apathetic the longer I continue taking stimulants. I’m not sure how I would function without considering was base line was a constant struggle.

These days, I've replaced Dexedrine with nicotine patches/gum, but tbh they barely do anything, I've been spending my days doing pretty much nothing, other than playing video games or watching shows, just to pass the time because even these things don't bring my joy anymore. Don't even get me started on how scary it is to jerk off, then climax but without the high. 

Now I'm starting school in a couple of days, and I only have 2 courses to take, might drop one of them, haven't decided yet. Problem is I'm not even sure that I can do one course this semester, and getting back on the Dexedrine is not really an option because I don't think it has helped with productivity in a long time. It increases my motivation, but it also makes me very anxious. The psychiatrist I used to see a long time ago suggested I take a betablocker to counter the increase in norepinephrine from the Dexedrine, but I'm not sure that's a good idea in the long term, it would probably screw up my brain even more. 

So I was thinking about Wellbutrin, I see many people suggesting it for amphetamine cessation. I'm mainly concerned with its withdrawal symptoms, and whether it's better or worse than Dexedrine in the long term. 

My current script is 5mg Dexedrine IR (I've been tapering down with my doctor). I'm also considering just taking this if I can't manage the 1-2 courses I'm planning on taking. I've noticed that 5mg don't really give a hangover,  which would make it easier to not take it everyday, and maybe I'd be able to allow my brain to slowly heal that way.

It's a really difficult situation that I'm in, so I'd really appreciate any feedback.

When I was in it, I was so sucked into the high that it made me emotionally numb and able to ignore the reality of what I was doing to myself. So thinking this through on a clear mind is kind of disturbing. Primarily because it makes you such a zombie and honestly coming from a methhead, seeing other people visibly damaging/have damaged their brain with methuse and seeing them spun out on meth, while I'm sober, is uncomfortable and really sad. Like some of the bad methheads on Soft White Underbelly or even the few meth addicts I've met in real life (I was a loner DN methhead so I didn't get out much), it's scary and gives me a nice reminder of what I don't want to be again.

Some of that sadness and fright probably stems from me watching exactly what I was doing to myself, you know. But then being able to relate some of that perspective to that of my familys' in relation relation to my addiction, then adding on top the fact they were watching their own son/brother/etc. go through it. Destroying my brain, seeing rapid weight decrease, going insane and hallucinating strongly every second almost instantly upon using, isolating from everybody, fucking up my face, and casting that thousand yard stare looking gone.

I don't know if I'm explaining this well because it's more just a weird thing to think about for me. I accept that it happened, but I kinda wanna forget those memories. Although I guess that's motivation to move forward. Thinking of the pain I caused them is a good deterrent. But the specifics of it is just hard to think back on.

I don't know. 1 month off meth in two days, so it's a bit fresh and has been worse on every relapse (classic), but just typing randomly cause I don't talk about it much in real life. And this recent recovery process has been my most hopeful so far, doing great honestly and happier than usual, so I'm feeling good overall no worries.",15

In my past I used to binge drink and was addicted to a handful of different hard drugs through four years. Now I'm sober and strongly against the mind-altering substances.

Today was sort of a family gathering and I clearly stated that I'm not going to drink. Felt no cravings and my mood was quite alright. There was this one lady who's my distant relative who knew about my previous struggles, but it isn't me who told her so we both pretend like she doesn't know because I haven't said a word about it.

First thing, after I stated my sober point she (ironically?) asked my why I didn't quit smoking if I'm not going to drink today. Lady like how the fuck it's your business?

Second, when she was already drunk to the point of talking non-stop, singing and dancing, she went out to the balcony where I was sitting with a cigarette after my workout session. Asked me about my workout, this is where I got engaged in the conversation and started telling her about some nuances. I got quite gesticulating and made my voice clearer and louder since I was telling her about the thing I love.

And that's where she interrupted me with a line: ""Why are you acting like that? Waving your hands here and there! You think it's cool, why you got to show off like this? You're acting like a complete druggie!"". I was shocked and my response was something like ""What?.. I'm just interested in that topic and you know that I'm very emotional by nature."". After that I shut down into my thoughts.

FUCK. In that moment my head wasn't quite clear since I was resting after a long heavy workout. And her words even made me question myself and did shaken my self-confidence a lot.

I don't know how to feel about it now. Don't wanna talk with her ever again, not a single time in my life. You're not my family member if you're not even showing compassion but going straight offensive on my trauma-related topic.",12

Even though it was the most underwhelming drug I’ve done, i LOVED it. Fuck I hate her so much for introducing me to that shit. After just doing it with her about three times, I thought about it every day, but didn’t have any money to get it.

My birthday was just a few days ago and I used my birthday money to score a gram. This was the first time I was able to do it since I did it with her, and my first time using it alone. I only finished about a quarter of the bag on my birthday, did it all by myself.

Everyday since then, I’ve been doing keybumps and medium lines of what I have left, usually one in the afternoon and one in the evening. I did a key bump before going out to dinner with family today, that kind of made me go “wtf am I doing”

Yesterday, I went to my girls place and drank a shit ton of vodka, smoked a joint and did bumps with her and her sister. That combo made me extremely paranoid and I was convinced I was gonna die. 

Didn’t stop me from doing more though lol. When I got home, I organized a ton of shit and rewarded myself with a line. I thought I deserved it for doing something as menial as organizing all my cds. That was day 5 of using coke daily alone, what the fuck was I thinking??? I guess my body kind of told me stop because that line made me very anxious and gave me chest pains.

I have about 0.4 left of it just sitting there in a tin. This is not a drug I can afford, my family is very poor and I fear once I get a job, ill end up impulsively buying more.

Every time I do coke and come down, I think “I hate this drug I’m never doing it again” until I do more the next day. It’s just a vicious cycle and I’m so scared because I feel like I’m losing control, I really underestimated this drug and how addictive it really is.

What should I do with the rest of the coke? Is my life ever going to be the same, I miss when I had never done it

TL;DR: did coke a couple other times in social situations and loved it. just turned 16 and bought some to celebrate. Now I’ve been doing it every day since then, alone. Think I’m losing control and don’t know what to do. Still have half a gram left and idk if I have the guts to flush it",15

2021-09-02 09:00:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/pghes8/completely_lost/,Completely lost,"They say you must first be lost before you can be found. I’m starting to feel like I am never going to be found. I repeat the same cycle relentlessly thinking that it’s totally innocent and I must not be doing any harm to my body because I can’t see or feel the damage. I play these minds games on myself subconsciously without any effort and what I struggle with is how to stop myself from being the player. I’m so sick and tired of having to lie constantly to cover up my actions or protect my desire to use. I hate myself for what I’ve become and I am finally starting to accept that this is actually the path I chose and now I need to figure out how to get off it and choose another path. My reason for this post is…

I signed myself up for an IOP program or Intensive Outpatient program starting soon and I’m scared that it isn’t going to be enough. I don’t get why this happened but I was steadfast and profound about going to an inpatient rehab to get help. But then I starting pushing it out further and further until I eventually became too scared to go and created some BS reason in my head why going to IOP would be better for me. I have the time off from work to go, I have the support from my family, all it’s missing is me. Everybody says that the withdrawals are hardly existent and all you’re going to do is sleep for days. But that’s not the case for me. I experienced strong withdrawals especially about 7 days into sobriety. Primarily extreme anxiety and the onset of full blown panic attacks. The type that you need to use medication to return to a sense of calm (such as a benzodiazepine). I’m afraid of seizures, debilitating depression, psychosis, and the struggle to re-wire my brain back to the norm. I’m thinking that for being a heavy user for nearly 2 years, IOP isn’t going to have the ability to treat what I’m up against. So it points to the question; is Inpatient Rehab the better choice than going to Intensive Outpatient? What was your experience if you received treatment to stop speeding? What’s your advice? 

I really appreciate your input. Thanks for reading.",7
2021-09-02 08:38:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/pgh1kd/readjusting_to_normal_person_time/,Re-adjusting to normal person time,"When I wrote on speed, I would clear the calendar. Like, if I had a deadline at 6 pm on Wednesday, I would not schedule anything for Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. Or when I would decide that a day was a ""work day"", I would clear the calendar, because obviously once you're in the speed zone, you don't stop yourself and then go meet someone for coffee, right? Or at least I didn't. I simply had speed/work days, and days for dealing with people and pretending like I was a semi-functional, normal human being.

I'm having a hard time adjusting to normal person time now that I'm sober. Like, if I have a meeting at 3 pm, I won't do anything else that day before the meeting. I still block things off like I'm doing them with speed: no obligations with people on Thursday so that's a work day. I recognize that normal people will work during the day, and then maybe meet someone for drinks or dinner after. But in my speed user brain, a day where I have to meet another person means ""healthy functional non-working day"". 

Anyone else self-employed/freelancing have trouble organizing their time post-speed? It's like everything in my life is still organized according to drug logic, even without the drugs.",24

I had already had problems with drugs and alcohol, and the legal problems that come with that since I was in high school. I’d been doing good when I got addicted to adderall though and nothings had a hold on me like this shit. 

Spring and summer of 2020 was the worst it ever got. I spent weeks by myself, staying up for like 3 or 4 days at a time just tweaked out of my mind. I got my shit together eventually, but was still using once or twice a week. Being functional though. In November 2020 I had a seizure after staying up for like 2 days. I was alone, didn’t realize it was that till weeks later when I was talking to someone whose had seizures. It scared the shit out of me. I didn’t do it for months after that. 

Spring of this year I started again, just here and there and much smaller doses. I always think I can control this shit idk why I keep testing it. Im fuckin spiraling with it again though. Back to using a couple times a week, and staying up all night and letting it fuck with my life and relationships. I know I gotta stop but idk how to commit to it. Idk how to stop the urges and stop tryna convince myself that this time it will just be one, that this time I’ll be able to control it. I know you have to be fully ready to stop for good, and I don’t think I am. Being high is hands down my favorite feeling and I don’t wanna have to give that up.

My husband admitted 2 years ago that he was smoking meth.  I was so shocked but promised I would help him in anyway possible.  For 2 weeks he pretty much slept and ate.  After 2 weeks he started to perk up and everything was going great, until January.  He lost his job when he failed a drug test.  When I questioned him he claimed that he went to a friends house and smoked meth the night before.  He swore it was only that one time.

I believe that he is using again, however he denies it anytime I ask.  I have been researching signs of meth use, but he is very good at hiding it. This is where I need help.  I have noticed changes in him.  He stays up most nights working in the garage.  He has taken apart lawnmowers, dirtbikes, gokarts.  Pretty much anything that has a mower.  He has not put anything back together.  He has been driving around picking up junk that people leave out for trash.  He brings it home, claiming he his going to build all this stuff for the house.  I have also noticed huge personality changes.  He was always so calm, and friendly.  Now he is argumentative with everyone.  He seems to have a lot of rage.  For example the other night we were having an argument, nothing serious and he threw his plate of food across the room.  Another time he punched a hole in the door.  He has also become super jealous and is constantly questioning me on who I am cheating on him with.  I am getting so fed up.  I asked him the other day to just be completely honest with me and let me help him get help, he blew up and said he was tired of me accusing him of using.  I just don't know what to do anymore.  I love him, we have been together for 20 years.  I feel like I am slowly loosing him.
