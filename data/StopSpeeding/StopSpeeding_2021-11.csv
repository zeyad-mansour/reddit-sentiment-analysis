I do coke with friends but can't really afford so I just do it whenever my friends have it and offer.

But I havent used any stims in awhile. But all of a sudden, after 2 years of sobriety from meth, I'm craving it extremely bad. I had a dream last night where I was doing meth with my friend then woke up disappointed because it was a dream. 

Now all I can think about is going down the path all over again to get some. That clean, euphoric, amazing high. I've done tons of stims, but nothing came close to the awesomeness of methamphetamine.

I haven't had a meth dream in a very long time. I almost forget shard even existed. Then BAM! My mind tells me to go get some.

I know I'll always be an addict. Even sober, I'm an addict. And it's a constant battle. And I know if I relapse, the game is undefeated and I will not win against it. No matter how much I try to justify my addiction. 

What's your guy's advice to ignoring these demons? I seriously feel like a monster is taunting me right now. Maybe  working out could help?  Then some meditation? Or some healthy brain food? I don't know what to do.

Idk how to really talk about this so I might as well just start spilling 

So I am experiencing extreme boredom, I'm incredibly depressed, I still have crippling ADHD, and to top off the mental health soup my egg finally cracked and I started transitioning after I quit (yay :)).

My current struggle is really the self hate and boredom. Being trans is where most of the self hate comes from, that's a whole beast within itself. What I want to bring to you all, is the boredom, Jesus christ I am so bored all the time.

I kind of ruined a lot of my hobbies on adderall, I can't really play games anymore like I used to, I just can't focus on them anymore. I can get through by talking to friends and enjoying their company, but I can't spend 24/7 with them. When I'm alone I pretty much only have energy to sleep and watch YouTube in bed. 

Then I ruminate, and ruminating is really bad with ADHD, I always end up thinking about being trans and wishing I wasn't and breaking down. I'm always living in my own head and it's exhausting, I just want to be able to live outside myself with a hobby or something but I can't get out of bed or focus so it seems impossible right now.

I know life will get better once I'm fully transitioned, but that's the catch, it's the hardest at the beginning where I am now. If I had more focus I could maybe pass the time more and get through these fist months. But instead I just sit around hating myself all day lol and time crawls by. People start looking like their preferred gender around the 6 month to 1 year mark, I know I will get there but God damn let's pick up the pace a bit.

I started wellbutrin recently and I don't feel different really, maybe more energy but instead of laying in my bed I just sit in my computer chair and stare around my room for hours now. 

This is the worst part for me being off adderall, I KNOW I'm capable of doing things, I was so good at EVERYTHING I did thwacked on adderall. The euphoria didn't last for me, what really kept me hooked is the focus I had. I could really get into games, books, cleaning, being on task at work, don't get me wrong, I know I was slowly dying, but I wasn't bored.

That focus, so intoxicating. God I love being out of my head, when you can focus you aren't thinking about yourself. I was shown what it's like for your mind to switch into focus mode and I want it back. Fuck the euphoria, give me fucking focus back. 

I guess to wrap up this mess, if any of you read this, has anyone felt relief from extreme boredom after stimulants? Do SSRI's help with focus? I don't need mood regulation, I just want to be able to focus again.



TLDR: extreme boredom after being off adderall for over half a year now, can't focus on anything and am very depressed because of it, will an SSRI help with focus?",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9981805086135864}"

He then started talking about how this shit is dangerous and even he is currently addicted to it. He said “ what I’m doing right now is trying to save your life” he handed me the smallest dub ever and let me hit his bub a few times. But I really took his words to meaning. After I finished smoking the little bit of shards, I really want to change my life around and quit all drugs. I miss the old me when I was sober for a bit earlier this year. (Started smoking up last year around Halloween, but went completely sober for a few months around April may cause I lost my license) I owe one of my weed friends 10$ but I really just want to cut everyone out and try to get my sober time back. My guy hasn’t texted me the usual do you need any and I think he genuinely cares about me. 

I have a problem with other drugs too like weed and cocaine and Ritalin, but I think it’ll be pretty easy for me to stop, I’m currently on social security income for my schizophrenia so I don’t really have access to my own money anyways. I’m just going to try to take this time to be with my family. I just hope I don’t get tempted and go steal a benzedrex or steal my dads extra Ritalin. The moment I somehow believe I have no access to drugs, I can start to focus on better things.

What did your process look like?,"How old were you when you started and when did you quit? What was your mg/d during this time? How old are you now? How did it go?

I started on 20mg IR once per day at ~ age 22 and about one month later I bumped it to 20mg IR 2x per day. Did this for 9 years. Earlier this year I switched to 30mg XR once per day and one 10mg IR broken in half so that I take 5mg at 8am and 5mg at noon. 3 weeks ago I stopped taking the 9am 5mg and I feel fine - maybe a little more sluggish but so little that it could simply be me psyching myself out. I think I’m going to stop taking the noon 5mg after the holidays. Thus, my total daily dose will drop from 40mg to 30mg. I intend to repeat this process until I reach 0mg. I have not yet looped in my psychiatrist to this tapering plan (need to remember to do that lol. I’ll give them the update when I meet with them in 2 months).

My reason to explore quitting is just because. I don’t want to be reliant on anything like I am with adderall. Curious to see how I do without it. It has helped me get through college and the early part of my professional career.",9,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9981231093406677}"

All I do is cry, nothing feels real anymore, and I start to view meth as the only way back to myself. I know I sound dramatic, but I don't know what else to do. I don't even know if going to rehab where I can withdrawal with medication will even be enough to fix me. I feel that my brain may be unrepairable.

32m here.

A few years ago I was perscribed dexamfetamine for the first time, I didn’t end up using it for that long and was able to stop pretty easy from what I remember.

I recently started taking it again I think around the time covid started and then decided to stop again and remember coming off it being hell although I was coming off all my medications at once so I think it was all of them that made it so bad. (Effexor, bupe, clonazapam, seroquel and the dex all within a simalar time frame. 

I ended up getting better I can’t remember how long it took but ended up going back on anti depressents and pain medication (I suffered a serene workplace accident in 2016 and have chronic pain and nerve damage).

I decided to start taking dex again roughly 3-4 months ago but I just keep abusing it, I’m perscribed 4 x 5mg dexamfetamine tablets per day but always end up taking any where between 4-12 5mg tablets to the point where I run out of my script and have had to wait a week (sometimes more) every time I’m out.

Iv decided I can’t keep abusing the medication and either have to stop taking it all together or have it given to me every day from my partner instead of having access to them all the time.

If I was to just not take them any more (I ran out of pills today and can’t refill them for 7 days) will I feel as bad as I did the previous times I stopped or was the severity of that that likely more due to trying to stop all my meds at once?

This is the 3rd time in the past few months iv ran out a week+ before I can refill, each time in that period I have just felt lethargic/tired,bit depressed/cbf doing any thing and a bit moody.

How long would this last?
Should I taper off them when I get my next refil or just not pick it up and tuff it out?

Any advice would be great 👍

I 've been abusing my vyvanse prescription for 2+ years now, although in the last year I have slowed down A LOT compared to how I used to binge my 30mg prescription in just a week-- now, over the last year I have been able to make it last a month by taking days off in between. 

However, I've reached the point of tolerance again where I need 120mg+ to get me going, but even then I just feel too anxious to actually complete the tasks I need to get done. I am also in the middle of a career transition period, I've been mostly teaching myself the skills for over the last year (and quit my job 6 months ago to put full focus into this-- amongst other reasons..). 

My issue now is that I am just so BURNT OUT. From the vyvanse, weed (that I need to smoke to calm me down from the vyvanse high), and this awkward career transition phase that I am constantly questioning whether I am even prepared enough to do. I bought 16g of mushrooms over the weekend with the intention to microdose as an alternative to the stimulants, and it's only been 2 days of microdosing so far but I just feel tired more than anything. The exhaustion is probably due to PAWS since last time I took vyvanse was 120 mg on Saturday. Now I'm questioning whether I should just go back to using the vyvanse at least until I get my first job in this field, because I really don't want to prolong this awkward phase any more than I already have....

So my question to you is, has anyone here been in a similar position? Is stopping speeding at this point in my awkward phase a bad idea? Can anyone here vouch for microdosing psilocybin to be a healthy alternative to vyvanse?

FWIW, I never use vyvanse when I'm in an actual work or social setting because I hate the person I am on it, so I wouldn't be using it during interviews or when I actually get employed, since the pressure of having to please people socially is enough to get me focused, it's just that when I am in my room alone trying to pull together my resume and my portfolio, that I get stuck in my head and crave the vyvanse to help me get out.. but I wonder if I stuck to microdosing for a bit longer that it would help serve this purpose too, and benefit my brain in the long term as well, unlike the weed and amphetamine. I really want to move onto the next chapter in my life ASAP

Essentially we are all coming off of either heroin or meth and are all pretty toxic people since we are suffering coming off drugs and coming off the streets, out of prison, etc. 

But I expect better because I wasn’t raised to treat women like shit. 

She calls me “nuthouse crazy”, says I have minions in my head, says girls that slit their wrists don’t do it right and do it for attention, makes fun of everyone here, plays power games, intimaidates everyone, is an all around bully, talks about drugs etc. 

I moved in with her when her roommate moved out, and prior to me moving in we were pretty close. 

Now that I’ve moved in with her I see her ugly side full on. 

I told her I’m moving back to my room because I had it alone and liked it because only 2 other women have a room by themselves and I don’t want to be stuck with her. 

And she got really upset, goes to length to avoid me, slams doors on me, and treats me like even more shit. She says I’m a snob and judgmental (she’s one to talk) and just overall treats me poor. 

I don’t have the best relationship skills (and abandonment issues) hince I turned to drugs. 

How do I deal with her living with her in the same house, her having a position of authority, and her confronting me and avoiding me?

You probably should scroll down a bit before you start reading to decide if you want to commit tho, lol. Ok, back to past-me.

&#x200B;

It’s probably going to be a long one, as with some luck, it hopefully will be introspective for me maybe, or I don’t know, I could just be an asshole who loves talking about himself, haha. Be that as it may, I feel like I really need to share this stuff, so here goes.

I’m in my early 30ies and I’ve been an amphetamine addict for years now, which has also made me a gambling addict. Tried speed first something like 7 or 8 years ago when I was working in the UK for a year before thankfully returning home – that year’s a fair contender to the “Unhappiest whole damn year of my life” award, lol, so I guess it makes sense.   
Skip forward a bit, and for the last 3-4 years I’ve been doing speed almost regularly – every weekend at first; then started already on Friday at work (“hey, I’m so much more productive and motivated, and it’s objectively quality work!”); then Thursdays, and finally some weeks started on I Wednesday.

So, basically some weeks went with me the while almost not sleeping at all for most of the week, eating very little, then crescendo on Friday, eased in on Saturday (partially because my brain was just switching off), didn’t do any on Sunday, but obviously was still riding the high, then maybe Sunday evening the panic started to flash in, Monday was just horrible, Tuesdays I was tired and depressed, but at least had a reasonable level of control over my brain, including to sometimes convince myself that the super shitty sense of guilt, shame and general emptiness and worthlessness is my brain chemistry doing it’s best to keep up with my bullshit. All that just to start again Wednesday afternoon while feeling I’m just watching myself with disbelief without any control at all.  
 Add a couple of moments of total despair when I’d gambled away my whole paycheck with rent already due af, and me already having borrowed money everywhere I could, even a couple of friends – just the worst damn cocktail of withdrawal, regret and stress.

Here's a happier part - I managed to quit for 4 months after that last super intense period – it was a long way coming, started trying therapy etc. but after like half a year of trying to figure out how addiction works on me, what triggers it etc. And those 4-5 months were literally the happiest of my life, and I’m kinda not exaggerating – even in my late teens and early 20ies I had never been so content, calm and happy. Waking up 5-6am without an alarm clock, working out, walking \~15k steps every day, being confident and most importantly – grateful. I don’t think it was that first euphoria of quitting too, as it had been like 4 months already, although I don’t know enough about it to be 100% sure.   
Ok, brace for some cheesy cliché, haha, although I like to think it's not cliche when it's sincere, so whatever, but one of my fondest memories is of one perfect summer’s Saturday when I was taking a nice lazy walk through the local park, I suddenly noticed how oversaturated the air was with the sound of children laughing, dogs barking, goshdarn birds chirping, how many people were smiling – I got so overwhelmed by gratitude and love for life, I teared up, lol.

Ok, been writing this for a while now and I probably need to get some sleep, so gonna just cut to the past year – went back to speed (poker night, I thought cocaine wouldn’t make me fall back to speed as I was so content with life – not a good idea) and been using it even more regularly at times, but less of it – mostly sleeping/eating at \~70% of my normal amount, and the decline hasn’t been as rapid and traumatic, but I am recognizing how I’m slowly-yet-surely slipping back to more extreme binges.

Today I even called my GP to get me a sick leave as I hadn’t been sleeping for a full day and at 5am I realised I can’t go to work looking and feeling so tired and anxious (a while after I left yesterday’s “saying hi” post) – getting sick leave feels like a stupid line to cross/game to play as it’s already incredible I’ve worked for a single company for over half a decade. I’m pretty good at what I do, but still, the real MVP for me keeping this job is Lady Luck, haha.

And we’re finally to this exact moment – around 90 ago I had 1.5g of really potent speed left (“And how wasteful would throwing that out be? Too wasteful, I say!” amirite bois), then remembered about me wanting to try Reddit/Discord groups and saying hi yesterday – it felt like such a good moment to make an honest attempt at actually stopping that I made myself dispose of all of it, yay! Not gonna feel great for a couple of days but since I’m on sick leave till Wednesday, I have space to not stress about how I look, feel etc.

Last, not least – as anyone here can probably guess, it’s not my first time of throwing everything speed related out, but I think that shouldn’t diminish the fact that I did the right fucking thing. It’s not a huge thing but it’s a precious step in the right direction, you know? Just realised how much I missed those, makes me really sad, but also hopeful and a little bit proud of myself.

They want to help and provide pretty much any resource they think will help. I will be having ketamine infusions to keep depression at bay. I will have sleep meds and benzos if I need them . My boyfriend is taking care of the kids and the house for me. The only thing is they recommend I do a tolerance break as I’ve already been taking the highest dose for two years and it’s just shredded me. Im 33 years old and feel like an old woman. My health vitality and even personality have just been devastated by this medication. I have dabbled in abuse but usually I revert back to prescribed dose after a day or two. My doctors don’t want me off it. My ADHD and comorbid depression along with PTSD make it really hard for me to live even the simplest of a life. But I’ve been trying so hard in the last two years to get me and my kids in a better place. I have sole custody of them and one is a very high demand special needs child. I started the University degree that I dreamed of since I was 8 and never thought I’d be able to reach. But I feel like I’m just being drugged into functioning and losing my soul and health in the process. I don’t know if I’m going to be strong enough after the month to just say no this is it. I’m done. Sorry for the long rant. I just want to find some help as I go through this and maybe just maybe I’ll have the strength to walk away. I’d like to go to some meetings of any kind that may be on zoom or join the Discord if that’s still going on. Just point me in the right direction please. And thank you all you beautiful people that are on here willing to lend a listening ear,4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.997574508190155}"

I’m 24 year old(male) now, and for a long time - like for 6-7 years I had a problem on and off with taking prescription stimulants like Adderall, Ritalin, etc. not as prescribed…
I try to manage other complications in my life as well like my chronic illnesses that are debilitating, even with medication so that’s just important to note.

I even at one point went on the street and spent $1-2k on addy because no one was prescribing it to me at the time.

I would run out of refills early. I would combine stimulants like pre-workout with Adderall(bad decision - sent me to ER and felt like I was dying). I would run out anywhere from 1 day early when I first started to abuse it, and eventually I got to the point of running through my script in 9 or 10 days when it’s supposed to last a whole 30 days…I know that some people here possibly could say that my 60-90mg(my prescribed amount) is nothing compared to massive amounts of something like meth or other drugs but I finally took 200mg+ daily the last binge I was on… It just was no good. 

I was forced by my family to go into a sober living facility after 10 days of “detox” and I was there for a full 6 months. I absolutely hated the place and I tried to figure out every single day how I can get out of there(I couldn’t because financially I had no savings and nothing at all).. So I stayed and there were many times I wanted to die and sometimes I wouldn’t even tell the staff because of my other health issues that are debilitating that I experience every day so I felt nobody would understand me.

It was a crazy ass experience listening to NA/AA meetings and going to these groups and even after I left, the day I left I felt that I got literally nothing from the place. I went over 6+ months of sobriety with insane challenges in the way and I never gave myself credit until now. 

I was sober for 6-7 months. I’m going to be honest I have diagnosed narcolepsy and I have diagnosed ADHD and unfortunately there aren’t many treatments for me at all other than stimulants - so I am back on the Adderall (prescribed), at least for the time being, BUT… guess what ? I finally do not have any urges to take more than prescribed and I still get the thoughts that pop up out of nowhere occasionally where I need more. But guess what, I know I don’t need more. I’m surviving without more! I take it for clinical health issue purposes, but I said NEVER AGAIN. Never again will I go back to that phase I guess you can call it of my life. I never want to relive that 6 month program again. And I know that I’m good with what I got and that’s very important to me. 

I guess my overall point here is -
You guys CAN tame the beast/dragon, or whatever you wanna call it.. Just know that if you are going through it bad at the moment and you want to help yourself even the littlest bit and know this path isn’t right for you anymore, that everything is in place already and that you CAN do it. I mean even if you have the simple thought of I want to get better and not do this anymore, then each day is a stepping stone, but “Just for today” is one of the only things I took from that rehab program and just for today you can do what you have to do to get through it and you can and will..

I have been needing to do a post for several days to get some of these thoughts out of my head but I haven’t been able to accomplish much of anything lately. My days / mornings are getting considerably worse so I need to do this right now. I have so much to say so this is probably going to be all over the place.

In one week I will hit ONE YEAR since the last time I ingested Adderall, quitting a five year daily 20-60mg addiction / dependency.

One year is supposed to be the big shining light at the end of the tunnel. I read posts where people report how happy and grateful they are. Well I hope the way I feel drastically changes in the next week because I feel absolutely sh*tty -- tired and hopeless.

It’s almost 3pm and I’m still in bed. I am completely stressed out about my financial situation. A month ago I went and got a part time job at a retail store and I was thrilled to have a place to go to get out of the house and be around people.

This job requires 8 hours of non-stop walking and lifting. It has completely broken me down physically. I just got over being sick (common cold) for two straight weeks and now I have some kind of lower back injury.

This would be all good except for the fact that this job pays LOW. Like the paychecks make my jaw drop. And yeah it’s part time but even if you doubled them they would be atrociously low. The lowest income of my life combined with the highest inflation of my life going into the winter -- and I feel like maybe 65-70% recovered off Adderall. Some days feel like the very beginning.

So I booked a side gig film project for extra money and this project has turned out to be a ton more work than I quoted the client for and on top of that he just hit me with a two day deadline.

Basically what would take me 30-60 minutes on Adderall is dragging days and weeks. I take caffeine, tyrosine, l dopa, and this supp called brain food.

I had a surge of momentum getting this retail job and it was crushed by being physically run down for dirt pay.

So now it’s snowing and I have to be Superman and figure out a new solution. 

My dad came to visit this week to help me around my apartment and he ended up getting very mad and leaving prematurely because he “felt sad” for me because when I finally had a day off I could barely get out of bed. I told him I’m exhausted from the job and stressed out so excuse me for not leaping out of bed to try to figure out how to Reinvent the Wheel (what my life feels like because no job is ever good enough to get by and when I did find a good job I got laid off from the pandemic).

My family has been very supportive of my Quitting Adderall journey but their patience is starting to wear thin and mine is too. I’m ready to get the F back on amphetamines so I can figure out a miracle to get a decent paying job. I have SO much to do and on my days off I can’t get out of bed.

In a week I will have a YEAR off Adderall and I don’t feel much different. I just want to sleep. 

People may say I’m depressed and to talk to my doctor about antidepressants. I’ve tried a handful of them including Lexapro and Wellbutrin and they do not help. They literally lead to me relapsing on alcohol every time. No thanks. I haven’t had a drink in over a month now since I got the Wellbutrin out of my body.

Antidepressants are not the answer. They just make me want to drink.

I don’t know what I’m hoping to accomplish by this post. I don’t really want drugs or alcohol I just don’t want to feel like this. Working out is cool but I owe my gym owner a video project so there is just another pressure. And it can be tough to not get bored trying to get in a 40 minute workout if I actually make it to the gym.

🤷🏼‍♂️ The positives of being off Adderall :

I have much more control of my emotions and I’m not a violent lunatic.

I don’t miss getting stuck in a stimulated state and needing to smoke , drink or masturbate to transition out.

My girlfriend says I’m a teddy bear of a person and our sex life is great.

-- if I could just get an adequate reliable job maybe I could muster up the energy to give a sh*t. I guess I’m just frustrated that I still have weeks of being a completely dysfunctional vegetable.

I want to feel a stimulated / high / excitement feeling -- SOMETHING to get my vibration up and to feel encouraged and hopeful.

I will do an update when I hit ONE YEAR next weekend. I would love to hear encouragement especially because at this point talking to my parents is just stressing them out. Thanks for reading.",8,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9993394017219543}"

I'm prescribed Adderall and I take it as prescribed now, but it's been almost a month I think since I abused stimulants, I took the last of my stash so I wouldn't have anything to get high off of. Only to find more.

I could gobble down a few grams of gabapentin and go to town getting spun, but idk what I'd do honestly, the drug discord is shut down and my friends all have lives. So I'd just be jaw locked and lonely, dog.

I guess I'm writing this all for validation, and reassurance that I shouldn't take them?

2021-11-17 00:00:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/qvri0b/selfdetox_and_selfrecovery_advice_based_on/,"Self-Detox and Self-Recovery, Advice Based on Personal Experience - Thoughts?","I'm trying to come up with the fastest and most effective way to detox on your own AND recover from meth and drug addiction using what I know about psychology (an interest of mine that I enjoy learning about) without having to go to a center.  There's tons of information on the internet these days, and often I find myself going with my research on the net as opposed to handing myself over to ""experts"" (quotations because... lots have failed me and many are too stubborn in their ways to consider anything not officially back by scientific studies, or generally approved of by the medical/psychological/substance abuse community).

So, for initial detox, I've come up with quite a few ways to get the crap out of your system as fast as possible.  There seems to be debate about how meth leaves the body, but if you've used it before (I'm referring to smoking it) you've surely realized there's not just one exit point for this stuff.    It starts oozing out your skin, you can taste it in your mouth, you smell it in your urine and stool, and I'm pretty sure it even comes out of your semen (the stuff is extra sticky and gooey when you're jerking off for hours and smoking).  If you're constantly smoking and then stop I think it takes days, maybe weeks to completely get clean. 

I believe the main way it leaves the body is through the skin.   Therefore, it's important shower at least 3 times a day.  My theory is that hot water tends to bring it out, but it layers really thick, so I turn to cold water to rinse.  I shampoo and body wash twice.  Sometimes I soak in the bath with epsom salt, but with the bath your just sitting in a pool of meth goo and your skin is going to reabsorb it.  So always shower after a bath.  When you rinse off with towels more meth is going to get on the towels so you need to wash it immediately.  And wash it as effectively as possible.  Use all the options on your washing machine like the soak and prewash, and put it at the highest cleaning method.  Do this twice, three times.  The smell of burnt plastic will still be there if you didn't clean it thoroughly enough.  This goes for your clothing too.

Rinse your mouth out with hot and cold water and swish the shit out of it.  When you spit you can see the slime in your spit.  I'm not sure whether or not mouthwash is a good thing, but it feels effective, if you hold in it your mouth long enough it burns like hell (I know this is usually the effect of alcohol killing the bacteria, but perhaps it's manages to ""pull"" some of the meth"").  Gargle it for as long as possible too.  Another detox advice thread I read suggested not brushing your teeth just yet as abrasiveness of the brush will just scrub the meth into your teeth.  Floss, though.  I don't think there's a problem with scrubbing your tongue, gums, cheeks and lips with the toothbrush.  I could be wrong. 

Next up is getting it out through urine and bowel movement.  It's advised to drink highly acidic beverages.  I use lemon juice and cranberry juice, but what seems most effective is Apple Cider Vinegar.  Pour a tablespoons amt, or more if you can handle it, into a glass and fill it with hot water.   HOT water.  Boil some water and let it cool down to the point where you can drink it without burning your mouth.  Swish that stuff around and you literally feel the vinegar pulling the meth out your gums, tongue, etc.  I usually spit the stuff out the first few rounds, but after that just swallow it down so I can expel it through urine.  Also, there's tons of meth residue in your mouth and when you eat and drink that stuff goes to your bladder or to your stomach.  Which is where forcing bowel movements comes in.  I'm thinking of getting laxatives for the next time I need to get the meth demon out of me.

Lastly, there's semen.  If you have no SO and are a chronic masturbator, edging on meth to a bunch of porn can be fun as hell.  But I think it's important to snap out of it after a few hours and just fucking cum.  However, cumming on meth isn't for the faint of heart.  I don't do it anymore because it's way too intense -  I couldn't stop cumming and was having multiple Os.  But I think if you do it early enough and resist smoking for a cpl hours it might be tolerable.   

Oh, and then there's hair and nails.  Pretty sure it's in those two as well.  I give myself a haircut, shave as much body hair as I feel comfortable with, cut my nails, and be sure to do other hygenic stuff like clean ears with Q-Tips.  

IMO, there's a lot of misinformation and confusion out there about the detox process.  I don't really trust what the rehab sites say.  I've gathered what seems to be more reliable information from forums dedicated to drug use and ones dedicated to drug recovery.  One rehab site claimed meth exited the body solely through the urine.  I scoffed as I sat there, meth oozing out of my pores, remembering my foul smelling bowel movements and incredibly sticky and gooey semen.  Sorry for the visuals, but this is the reality of detox from this insidious drug.

Thoughts and corrections or opinions on what I've put forward welcome.  This is mostly based on my research as a layman, and anectdotal experience.  I'm not claiming this is the best way to detox it's merely what I'm finding to work for me .  As for the self-recovery process (also doing it on your own), I'll save it for a seperate thread.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9947578310966492}"

I've been lurking on this forum for a while now, trying to figure out if this stuff applies to me, but I think it's time that I finally bite the bullet and accept that I have a serious problem.

I was first put on stimulants in high school. I tried both Concerta and Focalin and hated both of them. It might've been the interactions with all the Zoloft I was on, but I had crippling anxiety on these medications and swore to never take stimulants again. I was a downer person at the time anyway, smoking a shit ton of weed everyday and ran into a very nasty Oxycontin habit in my sophomore year of high school that I luckily kicked before it got the worst of me.

Fast forward to my sophomore year of college. I'm no longer on antidepressants, I still smoke a lot of weed and take the occasional party drug, but all things considered I'm super cleaned up. I did notice, however, that my ADHD was becoming a larger obstacle in my academic life. I tried a friends Ritalin a couple of times and while it still gave me a bit of anxiety, I saw definite potential for stims to help me concentrate and be more in tuned with my school work.

I ended up getting a prescription for IR Adderall and holy shit, I felt like my whole fucking world was turned upside down. I had struggled soooo badly with attention and procrastination my whole life and finally I felt like I was operating at my fullest potential. I was turning in all my homework on time and paying attention in class and just all around felt like the best version of myself. I was still super afraid of the drug though, recalling my past negative experiences and viewing Adderall strictly as a medication and nothing more.

Well, I don't know what the fuck happened since then. It started with gradual recreational use — that same friend of mine with the Ritalin script would advocate for snorting it at parties as a poor man's coke, and while I was resistant at first I realized that it was a ton of fun. Started off popping stims occasionally at parties as a little supplement to drinking, which then turned into popping stims almost always at parties, which then turned into me no longer fearing the medication during the day time. The real day time abuse didn't start until this year, my senior year of college. My dose is tripled on most days. No one really knows this. I don't smoke weed anymore because I don't want anything to get in the way of my speeding.

I've been pushing my body to its worst limits of sleep deprivation in the past month. Had periods where I averaged 2 hours a night. Took a little break recently, but am now back worse than ever. Only slept 2 hours last night after being up for 48 hours (all time record). I just fucking lock myself in my bedroom, lying that I'm going to hunker down and do my homework but procrastinate to the point where I justify redosing again and again because ""this time I'm really gonna get shit done."" And then all of a sudden it's 3am and I'm crushing and snorting another 20mg just for the hell of it.

The worst part about all of this is how fucking good my life was at the beginning of this script (before I started abusing it). That's the thing that keeps me going. I was so on my shit in a way I had never been before. I was getting amazing grades, saving up so much money, was so popular, started a relationship with my dream girl, got an amazing internship and got offered a job for them that I've been doing remotely while at school this year.

I don't know how I fell so fucking far. I've never done worse in school in my life. I'm so broke and have two jobs and am hanging on by a thread at both of them — everytime I check my phone I expect to be getting fired. I've lost so much fucking weight that none of my clothes fit me anymore and I cry about how shapeless my body looks every morning when I'm getting dressed. Had a tragic breakup. Made some horrible sexually impulsive decisions that exploded and hurt so many people. Covered in scars from picking my skin all day long. My eyes are so bloodshot that they hurt, it hurts to be looking at my computer screen and typing this right now.

But how do I stop? Especially when I'm at school, with two jobs and such a heavy courseload. I can't learn how to exist without Addy when I have so much going on. When I wake up I feel like a fucking zombie before I take my meds, even on the rare occasions when I do get a full nights sleep. I keep telling myself that I can go back to that place I was at, that I'll just reel it in and go back to being the best version of myself. But I've been the absolute worst version of myself for so long.

I know people post shit like this all day. I know what I'm doing wrong, and I know the only way to correct it. I probably won't though. I'll probably keep pushing it to see how bad it can really get. Taking another one right now because I can barely keep my eyes open. Telling myself it'll be the last one of the day. Hope I'm right.

  I'm not like so many I've read about. I was only actively using for a little over a year or year and a half? Along with some high dose mushroom/acid trips, extreme psychosis feelings from spice and all previously mentioned, I was nowhere near caring enough to put it down. I wanted change, but whether I was using 3 to 8 times a day or just 1 time a day, it would still get physically rough on me in a few different ways through thay time. 

 I really didn't have much of a problem using, but maybe a month or longer ago I stopped smoking and started snorting bumps to ""make it through the day"" as we do. However, switching ROAs did no help in reducing my thrush/generally worsening dryness/ dry lips etc.

 I quit snorting in an effort to quit but I would smoke with a friend once a day still. At this point the way it was, I was coming down by the end of the night, my pupils would dilate, my lips would get so red. I've always told myself I can quit at any time, longest break probably being a month or so last year. I met a girl, and knew it was time to turn my life around and haven't looked back.

 Sometimes I'm tired, but I dab thc, eat lots of homemade cannabutter, smoke weed, all daily sometimes, but dabs are my daily driver.

The route went all over the city and a few spots triggered some really crazy Adderall and alcohol-fueled memories. I ran past the concert hall where I’d do molly and dance with my friends. Ran past the first house where I’d ever snorted an Adderall. I ran past the alley where I was raped. Ran past the 711 where I had a psychotic breakdown. I ran through the streets where I used to run around like a mess, up way too late from the amps, stumbling around at 2am.


I wasn’t expecting to feel so emotional about some of those spots but just when I felt the worst, a gush of wind came through and swirled this beautiful cloud of yellow leaves around us. It swept us forward with the leaves and I legitimately almost started crying but I kept going.


It was so challenging and emotional and really solidified me in my decision to stop using amphetamines. It’s a part of my life I will never erase, never be able to get back. But I still have the whole rest of my life ahead of me and I’m ready to rewrite what I associate with some of these places.

I told my manager at work and all colleagues, and they support me so fucking hard it makes me feel like I never felt before. It’s wonderful, so much love. It’s strange to be without secrets in an instance. After the talk with the manager, for the first time, I could look everyone in the eyes. Someone I didn’t see for 3 months said I looked very very well like something changed (even after two days of speed with only 6 hours sleep haha), so it wasn’t about my looks, but about what I radiate. Confidence, no shame, no fear. I accepted myself and felt like there’s nothing left to hide, no more shame.
Sharing secrets and things you’re ashamed of and accept them.. what a change!!!!!
So curious about the growth I hope I will experience in rehab, I already feel like a whole new person. I’m proud of myself, I’m became strong by being vulnerable.
I think breaking the taboo is so important, how many people are living in shame... going further down day by day. At first I wanted to hide it from work and just call in sick because of stress, because I thought I would be fired. The manager directly said she still wants to give me a contract at their company when I’m back. I’m a temp worker at the moment, had my contract talk planned the 18th of this month. :)

It's more of a turbulent mental state and I apologize for not adding an option of being unsure. If you're comfortable, would you mind leaving a comment saying unsure under my post below if you were unsure. It doesn't need to be a story or anything. Just someway to indicate you're not sure.**

I’m a 20yo female, I’ve been abusing adderall for around a year and I’m currently almost 17 days sober. It was pretty much fine the first few days off, I was super hungry but I enjoyed it, a little tired but it felt nice. But after maybe day 3, I started to get random anxiety and panic attacks like I used to before adderall which I did not anticipate. My moods have been all over the place, I stopped talking to my friends and I feel terrible about it.

An hour or two after I wake up I’m hit with a mixture of anxiety/restlessness and extreme tiredness and exhaustion even though I’ve been getting like 10+ hours of sleep a night. I feel like I’m crawling out of my skin. I still feel like my heart is fucked, it races after I eat. As soon as I stopped the adderall I got acne all over my face for the first time and my hair looks and feels terrible. The worst thing is my self confidence. I loved how I looked on adderall, I was happy with everything about myself. Somehow I looked healthier on it than I do now. Now I have bags under my eyes, I’ve gained 7 pounds since I quit, and I was 104 at my lowest in the summer and now I’m 121. 

I don’t recognize myself in the mirror. I look exhausted, worn down and sad, and really pale for some reason. It feels like my facial features literally changed somehow. I’m embarrassed for anyone to see me and feel like it’s noticeable. I never wanna take adderall again, it was killing me physically and mentally.

On Saturday, I will be 451 days amphetamine free. I’ll also be running my first ever half marathon, which is something I NEVER would’ve pictured myself doing.


It’s been hard, don’t get me wrong. Especially this past week, even after all this time, I opened up my patient portal to make an appointment with my psych.


I had all the excuses prepared in my head. I have a BIG change coming up at work next month, that will require me relearning everything I know about my job. Everything I learned while on Adderall. Even though I got this promotion *after* being off speed for a year, I’m convinced I need it. Just for a few months, so I can learn everything. I have ADHD, so it’s okay, because I need it, right?


And on top of that, I’m getting married in February. I want to look amazing in my dress. I lost most of my post-Adderall weight, but gained about 5 lbs back. If I started now, I could lose 10 lbs by my wedding without even trying. I would have those pictures forever. So what’s a couple months back on it?


I told all of this to my fiancé and all but forced him to agree it was a good idea. And he said obviously do what you want, but, “didn’t you have a problem with that stuff?”


In the end I didn’t make the appointment. Followed by a day of being EXTREMELY grumpy, tired, and frustrated at everything. It’s like my addicted brain was throwing a tantrum, and I refuse to give it what it wants. Because I know I won’t just take it for a month or two.


I know if I take it to lose 10 lbs, I am going to gain 20 lbs back.


I know if I take it just up until the wedding, I’ll be sleeping through most of our honeymoon.


I know if I take it for work, I’ll snap at my coworkers, irritable from little to no sleep.


I know if I take it just on weekends, I’ll buy a pack of cigarettes and stay up drinking, and won’t be able to run like I have been.


So I guess for every “good” reason I have to take it, I know in my heart that there will be even worse consequences. And I’m terrified that even a month of using will reset my progress.


It’s crazy that after almost a year and a half, I still struggle with cravings so intense that I’m picking up my phone. I am starting to think I’ll never be completely over this, that there will always be a voice in my head saying “come on, one more refill, just for a little bit”.


So on Saturday, I am running for me, but also for all of you, for this subreddit that got me through legitimately the worst days of my withdrawals. I am so fucking thankful to find this place, for you guys letting me know I wasn’t alone. Reading your positive stories is what inspired me to quit, and I hope I can be that voice for someone else.

I am writing this, don't have much time now and anyway I wouldn't know where to begin. But it's the same old story, I am in a relationship with my boyfriend who is addicted to speed and deals drugs, mostly speed to feed his addition and he says to earn money but all he has done is gone in debts wherever he could. Last two months I started to hide my finances and telling him I don't have money because he spent it all so recklessly and even debts on his addition and all that. 
This August our baby girl was born. Ironically I found I was pregnant about this time last year when I finally found the strength to break up with him for real. He made ""the promises"" all again and it all fell to nothing. Things are better but only because of covid and he doesn't have much customers or people to get the drugs from because they are in jail. 
We live together in the flat from my family, before I met him he lived with his parents, I lived with my mum. We both have one child of our own from before. 
Everything was perfect for 1.5 year then we started both using (he is a previous drug addict for a long time but has been sober for 5-6 years and I blame myself that we started using in the first place). I stopped after 2 years, that was some 1.5 ago and now still I am realising the bad conseq6 my using had on me and my life, the people around me. He doesn't want to stop he doesn't even want to admit or say that he is using every day because he is addicted, he just uses it to perform better but actually does nothing. Our relationship has fallen apart in almost every way, I don't recognize him anymore. But the problem is I love him, really love him and I was in a bad and abusive relationship before him (have a son almost 6 years from that relationship). 
My boyfriend helped me a lot, I was never as happy as l was before drugs got in our relationship. He has a good family I have perfect relationship with them and I love them and they love me. Actually his and my family are very connected from long before we were together. Because all of that this is a very delicate situation. 
I am not happy in this relationship, I am sad because he was and he is my best friend, I left to love with my mum in a few short occasions (didn't tell her the truth) and when we are separated he is so much better in meanings of communication and then he is a friend. 
He goes out of the house all the time, he is I must say great with our daughter, he has more patience then me, he changes her diapers, feeds her, takes her for a walk so that I can do my business or rest. 
He says that I am the love of his life and I feel the same for him, I grown up with separated parents, my son never met his father because he left when I was pregnant and never asked about him. Same for him, his daughter lives with her mum and we both want our daughter to have both of us together. We will start going on couples counseling in 10 days, he agreed to my proposal for that. But the problem is that for him all is good, perfect, he is high in his own world. So he is agreeable but unreliable and what he says one day with so much determination, arguments etc tomorrow never another word about the idea from yesterday. 
We also don't have sex anymore, we used to do it a lot but with using he started to be awake until he literally falls asleep not in the bed, he is out all the time (i worry that he has another woman but he says he never had something with anybody else but me, but he doesn't see it the way I see it because he met some girls for drinks, ""friendly"" drinks behind my back and he says he didn't tell me because I would be jealous and wouldn't trust him but when I found out about some of that 2 years ago I never regained trust and I worry every day not that he finds someone else because I now even see that as a resolution of our situation that I obviously can't do, I can't leave him, i worry that I will be ridiculed, i Los mu self-confidence....) 
Sorry for the longer text, I am sad, upset and angry, i Don't know what to do, his parents and I spoke numerous times and we both agree that he has to go for addiction treatment that is the only chance and probably also won't work. I lost all hope.",3,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9906596541404724}"

How to return to / rise above previous baseline?,"So I have had an off-and-on relationship with amphetamines (mostly amphetaminesulfate) over the past 10 years. This has included stints of almost daily (ab)use aswell as stints of abstinence lasting for months or years. The appeal of them, for me, has been largely in their ability to help me be productive and get stuff done that I otherwise have a hard time getting motivated for. However, you all know how it goes: tolerance sets in, productivity eventually decreases despite amphetamine consumption, pointless hedonistic pursuits / fapathons get the better of you, you drink too much alcohol to come down / fall asleep, and the whole situation becomes unsustainable. 

&#x200B;

Most recently, I have been taking 30mg of pharmaceutical dextroamphetamine spread throughout the day for about 3 weeks. When I stopped about a month ago (for the above reasons), I had a few days of a pretty bad crash: very tired, eating tons, depressed, etc. That has since subsided. However, I now find it \*extremely\* difficult to get motivated / follow through on basically anything - much more so than used to be the case beforehand anyway, and much more so than after previous episodes of using amphetamines. Generally, I can force myself to do things that are pretty straightforward, like going for a run or having a shower, but anything that is composed of many individual steps requiring mental effort, like most work tasks in a desk job are (or, indeed, like writing this post), I find almost insurmountably tough. Have you guys experienced similar issues? What things (besides the obvious like exercise, regular sleep, good nutrition, sustained abstinence and patience) have helped you? How long did it take you to get back to baseline? And did you ever find a way to eventually get above your previous baseline (which wasn't very satisfactory to begin with, hence my interest in amphetamines in the first place) without using amphetamines?

When things like...  This wasn't worth,  what's wrong with me, i failed, everyone is mad at me including me, this is never worth it, why do i this!?.

Just remember.

We all make mistakes. We are going to make mistakes. Mistakes are beautiful and allow us to grow and embody the strength we denied ourselves but always had.

Take your power back and stand in your authenticity with authority.

Be open and honest with yourself and allow yourself to... Think, feel and experience all of it. Especially the bad things because that's where our power lies.

Take accountability.

Do not justify, do not project and most of all do not deny.

You are going to make that mistake and many more, that's just an honest fact. We wanna be perfect we want this time to be the last time... And hopefully it is...with a good outcome. Its never so easy and if it was? Id think addiction wouldn't be what it is today.
 
This is not an easy battle.

This isn't saying hey fuck it. this is saying and knowing.... 

That change comes when we are ready.
change is slow but also sudden. 
we need to make these mistakes so we can be strong and actually gain something from them and overcome. 
We need to take our biggest worst failures and turn them into out greatest truths and strengths.
Healing isn't linear and its painful, fact. It takes time, fact.

Someday just by being alive and embodying, wearing the face of survivor and being in your power. you set the example.

 Someone, somewhere, someday is going to see you like really see you and you're going to inspire them just by being you. 

And maybe that person or persons hides a secret addiction maybe its very open and honest. Bottom line they will relate to you and you will make a difference.

Do not allow yourself to be suppressed, denied and definitely not judged... Fuck that we've fought too hard to make it to today.


I like to call myself glen and I made a mistake.
This mistake was really hard for me but i am choosing empowerment. 

I define myself and how and ill be damned if if anything or one has anything to say about that. Because what you is what you get.

Packing for 90 day rehab ❤️,"To all those that warned me, I apologize. Those who stood behind me, thank you. Nature took it’s course. With a warm heart, I’m sorry for the choices I made and am appreciative to those who’ve been there and tried. It didn’t go unnoticed ❤️

Today, I began packing my one piece of luggage and one carry on bag that is somehow supposed to hold enough of my shit to last through my 90 day grippy sock vacation. I’m headed to a dual diagnosis treatment center near New Orleans to treat a nasty meth addiction. Been using orally damn near every day for 2.5 years and it’s destroying every facet of my life. 

I’m a 32 yr old female and have quiet borderline personality disorder, CPTSD, major depressive disorder and anxiety. It all appears to trace back to childhood trauma- abandonment issues from being placed in the foster system as a young child. My sister and I hopped from home to home until we ended up in an abusive home for a while.

I started using drugs when I was 13. Coke, weed, a little meth, ecstasy pills, Xanax bars, and alcohol. I didn’t discriminate. Heavy on the Xanax through high school, taking sometimes up to 7 or 8 bars in a day. As a 5’4”, 120 lb female, I probably should have quit breathing in my sleep on numerous occasions. I barely graduated due to attendance issues, but I got very high ASVAB scores. I know if I didn’t get out of this shitty southern town, I was gonna end up overdosed or in jail. I joined the Air Force. 

I cleaned up my act and really excelled in the military. I won a ton of awards, even one of the most prestigious awards the Air Force has—I was one of the 12 Outstanding Airmen of the Year. Long story short, I decided to finish up my enlistment and separate from the military. I had a MST (military sexual trauma) happen to me and ended up with a bad taste in my mouth due to how I was treated by the military afterwards. My husband at the time and I planned a baby, had said baby, and I got out of the military. We moved to Colorado and I went to college for a couple years while taking care of our son. I felt like I “should” have been “happy” at this point in my life…24, married to a man that loved me, a baby, in college and financially stable. Alas, this was not the case and I didn’t understand what was happening to me, just that I needed the pain to stop.

Everything my husband did started to get on my last nerve. They way he cleared his throat would make my blood boil. I quietly suffered from increasing depression and irritability and started to envision hanging myself from our second floor banisters. I was miserable. 

Despite my internal struggles, I was making good grades in school and my previous military award helped make me look great on paper. I decided to apply for a couple badass internships, just to see what would happen. I applied for one at the White House and to my surprise, made it through all the rounds of interviews and red tape. I had something to look forward to now and clung to that spark of hope for dear life. I even decided to go see my family doctor and ask for help with my depression symptoms. I had no formal mental health diagnosis at this time and had never even heard of borderline personality disorder.

I had been sober now for about 7 years, give or take. In hindsight, I should have turned down the huge Ativan prescription my doc offered, knowing I had a serious benzo problem in the past. That piece of paper for 120 Ativan a month (with a number of refills), was likely a contributing factor to the fucked up decisions I was going to make in the near future. 

I took out a $10k loan and rented a small apartment in DC for my 6 month internship. Soon as I got there I was able to breathe a sigh of relief for some reason, and it was confusing to me. I felt guilty for feeling better because I should have felt worse not being with my husband and 2 year old. I started abusing the pills and had a great time working at the White House, however I am ashamed because I don’t remember my time there as well as I wished I did. I also didn’t work as hard as I could have and feel like I squandered one of the best opportunities I’d probably ever have. 

After about four months there, I met a guy on Tinder and fell hard. My husband back home was 11 years older and a super traditional Filipino family man. We met when I was 18 and he was like 30. I never got to party or do anything “exciting” in my adult life, until I left for DC. I felt so free now and I think I tricked myself into thinking I was happy. I started to realize I didn’t want to go back home to Colorado. 

I literally never went back. I fucking abandoned my family and caused so much pain. I will never forgive myself and I don’t expect my son and ex to forgive me either. Biggest regret of my life.

I started drinking a ton and taking adderall too, in addition to my Ativan. My new man was a narcissist, but I didn’t know what that was yet. Oh my lord, we were passionate about everything. My ex was boring so this was heaven to me. We even moved to Manhattan together to work for a startup company he and his college friend invented.

Things became toxic, which eventually progressed to abusive. I took so much adderall and worked so much that it started taking a toll on my mental and physical health. I got super skinny and started hearing music that was not there. It was very quiet, almost indistinguishable, but I could make the music change depending on what I wanted it to sound like. I also started self harming and had a suicide attempt around this time. I started to seek mental health help and was told a couple different diagnoses, even schizophrenia by a doctor I met with one time only, but nothing really seem to fit. After a couple of years with the narcissist, the cheating and the lies and abuse became too much to bear and I left. I moved to Austin, TX.

I’m gonna fast track this story for the next five years and give only a brief synopsis. I just smoked weed daily for this time and was moderately happy. I also got my borderline diagnosis and this is when I started to really become more self aware. It helped me to give a reason (not an excuse) to my impulsive behaviors, chronic emptiness and “splitting” that seems to ruin all of my relationships. 

I moved back to Manhattan with a different boyfriend, because clearly I must learn my lessons more than once. Two years later, I called my momma sobbing, asking her if I can please come home. The physical abuse was getting worse and worse each fight and I was scared at this point. He pulled my hair so severely that I couldn’t raise my eyebrows without my scalp hurting badly and my arms were covered in bruises.

Two days later I packed my car and left that man crying on the doorstep. I drove the 24 hour drive back to my hometown.

I thought my life was over and I was a failure for coming back home. What can seem like the worst thing in the world, however, can actually be a blessing in disguise. I am grateful for what happened to me in NY, because without it, I never would have been back home for what was about to happen to my mom. Which also happened to be my downfall.

My mom was my heart. My best friend and a piece of my soul. I was her and she was me. She had been around 350 lbs my whole life and had health issues. She went for surgery for AFIB, but something went wrong and she was on a ventilator for three days. My stepdad, my sister, and I thought we lost her, but she survived. She ended up losing all of her strength however, and couldn’t walk, use the restroom on her own, even reposition her own legs properly. She tried her hardest in short term rehab to get stronger but it wasn’t working. She was in the ICU probably about four times in the next six months and almost died each time. I spent the night by her side every single night, sleeping in a chair for over three of the six months before she died, taking care of her every need, cheering her up and advocating for her. 

It’s exhausting and unsustainable to be present 24/7 like that. Especially while trying to work, I owned a small business at the time. I started orally taking small bits of meth to give me energy. 

I watched her bleed out enough from her rectum to produce a pool of blood around her hospital bed, watched her cry out in agony more times than I can count, and said my goodbyes to her more than once when doctors said she was going to die. I also became aware of abuse and neglect against her while she was at a nursing home in between hospital stays. I wasn’t allowed to stay the night with her there, but I sure as shit began popping in at all hours of the day and night to do random checks on my mom. 3 am, 3 pm, it didn’t matter, I’m going up there.

Meth use really starts to ramp up and I begin questioning myself, am I addicted?

Because I was the only one going up to take care of my mom, her and I decided to get a notary to secretly come to the hospital and we signed a medical POA, giving me the right to make end of life decisions that trump my stepfather’s rights. I knew how she was suffering, even though my family chose to ignore it. I chose to utilize my rights when she was septic in the ICU and gasping for air, but they couldn’t give her pain medication because of her health issues. My stepdad left for the night, and I was pissed off that he could leave her in such a state. I called him and told him about the POA and told him that he needs to come back because in 30 minutes I’m having the nurses start comfort care. He came and they discontinued her antibiotics and stuff and replaced it with morphine and Ativan. 

It took her three long days to die. I questioned my decision constantly and it felt like I was dying right alongside my best friend. I know that I made the right choice and my mom is proud of me for advocating for her, but my stepdad disowned me shortly afterwards. Kicked me out of my moms house a couple weeks after she died.

By the end of the six months that mom was hospitalized, I was taking considerably more meth than when I started. I was staying up for multiple days and having numerous negative side effects for sure. The PTSD of things I experienced with my mom haunt me  to this day and my BPD is worse than ever too.

She died over two years ago now, so it’s been over 2.5 years of almost daily use and it’s made my life unmanageable. Every facet of life has been effected and I’m ready to do better finally. It served its purpose…I took the best care of my mom when she needed me most and I would do this all over again in a fucking heartbeat if I had to. But the best way for me to honor my momma is to get a handle on my mental health and my addiction, because she was never able to do that for herself when she was alive. She wants that for me, I know nothing else would make her more proud. 

That being said, I’m doing this for me… I deserve so much more than I give myself. I’ll never have a shot of true happiness and healthy love until I sober up and learn new ways.

I’m going to rehab in 2 days and I’m going to unpack all of this shit and leave it there. It’s too heavy for me to carry around everyday. I’m scared af but also optimistic. I have a lot of hurdles to navigate when my 90 days are over but for now, I’m going to live in the moment and heal.

Well, I made it about four days until I took it again, and then I broke down and finally told my boyfriend about my struggles and gave all of my Adderall to him and told him to hide it.

I was Adderall free for about a week and a half after that, and then I had an appointment with my psychiatrist. I told him that I had stopped taking the Adderall and didn’t wanna take it anymore because of anxiety (I didn’t mention that I had substance abuse because I think maybe a part of me deep down doesn’t want to give up the possibility of ever getting it prescribed again).

I stayed stimulant free for about a week more but then I had another appointment, and I truthfully reported that my ADHD symptoms had been really bad lately. I’ve done things like leave the stove on multiple times, leave my keys in the front door, etc. My psychiatrist was pretty concerned, and thought that I should get back on a stimulant. He prescribe me vyvanse at 10 mg, and because I wasn’t that strong in my recovery I agreed. I actually didn’t have any anxiety with that dosage and really no urge to abuse my script. We had another check in this week and I was honest again about my symptoms, and he bumped me up to 30 mg of vyvanse daily. 

Anyways I’ve been taking the 30 mg dosage for two days now, and haven’t had any urge really to abuse… I’m just wondering what experience people have had switching between the two medications, and if I should still be concerned about abusing Vyvanse.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9845945835113525}"

Waitlist for residential rehab here in Western Australia has been long about 5 months and having to engage with them every week during this time has been tough however what is keeping me on track is almost half of 2020 I was in a drug induced psychosis and had to hospitalize myself Jan 2021.

Decided to pull up a bit and was shocked in the passing of my best mate in March 2021 with a brain hemmorage brought on by long term IV drug use... these factors have me scared of returning to such a lifestyle not to mention now having to face drug supply charges.

I'm nervous as hell due to my social anxiety and isolation away with the drug for twenty years ... life has been a blurrrr during that time , but I hope to one day come out of this addiction and start to feel something again... anhedonia brought on by stimulants use is the worse.. just hope I can do this for myself and give my mother her son back, so she can live out her retirement and golden years knowing that I'm OK...

Before it’s too late to get your beautiful 19 month old baby girl back WHO DIDN’T ASK FOR THIS SHIT. She didn’t ask to be here, she didn’t ask to have addicts as parents (we are both addicted to fentanyl and meth heavily), she didn’t Ask to be taken from my arms by complete strangers because I couldn’t just get clean. 

I haven’t seen her since July. I could already have her back in my care but ofc my selfish addiction gets my ass every time. This past Sunday I realized how pathetic and empty my life is. I’ve lost so many things this relapse. The biggest things aren’t material tho. I have never felt this low before….but something changed in me.

I realized that this is IT for me to get it together. I have four months left to get her back before the courts adopt her out. SHE IS MY LIFE. My heart is broken because I don’t have her! My world is useless! It is black, she is my light! My rainbow! I FINALLY realized that the universe can have the car, the apartment, the relationship, the family and friends, the money, everything. 

SHE WON’T TAKE MY AMANI. SHE WON’T. I love her too much. I fucked up MAJORLY and I could’ve left a precious soul with scars before she could even understand what that meant. 

I will Do Better, Be Better, No Excuses. I have a purpose greater than myself now & it will motivate me for the rest of my life.

I had been clean for 3 months, coming up( or was supposed to be) 4 months this month. I was an addy user for 8-9 months of this year. Using it for school and then for fun and then to basically sexually assault myself for hours lmfao. I hated the comedowns and where I saw myself headed. I was losing touch with myself. I was a cold hearted machine designed for work. It got me through the last year of high school with a higher GPA which I needed to satisfy my mother and family. 

It took 3 tries to break free from that sweet tasting pill. Each time causing me to almost take my life. I was able to recover on my own with no program but with support from my ex (who was in recovery for xanax and Percocet),research, and analyzing my addict myself. 
This relapse happened because I was doing horrible in school, and my mother kept adding pressure by saying to just ""leave school because I am wasting her money and time and work full time because I can't get it together"" I was able to put off using for school for 2 months. It seemed like a relapse would've happened but cravings faded and would not use. Its just the fact I can get my work done without battling myself to do it for days and eventually doing it late with MORE assignments to make up that made me want to use. 

I eventually caved and bought 3 30's. I only took 45mgs in the span of 6 hours because I knew I cannot use it how I used to and for what I used it for. I was doing 90-150mg daily running on 3 hours of half sleep and no food. I'm okay, and I know it'll be okay. I just cannot allow myself to fall back into those patters. 
I turned 18 finally about 2 days so I know I will turn myself into a rehab even before I START to lose control because I will never let it happen again. I didn't mind sober living, I missed the adrenaline though. Life felt bland and the thought of ""it can be better"" always was in my mind but I always told myself it ""but now you have less problems and don't want to kill yourself""

2021-11-03 14:27:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/qm0t9z/last_stop_on_the_stim_train/,Last stop on the stim train,"First discovered stimulants as party drugs at University, MDMA, cocaine etc. Used them at parties with friends, nobody really had problems. Then one night I discovered the combination of porn and stimulants which took control of my life for the next 5 years. I'd put off social events to stay in and take stimulants (usually speed, sometimes with mdma, sometimes cocaine, sometimes a combination and more recently mephedrone/ghb etc) and masturbate into oblivion. 

The feeling it gave was indescribable, like a constant orgasm that lasted for hours and hours.... dopamine coursing through my brain at levels that shouldn't be achievable..feeling like I'd won the lottery for hours on end, like I'd found a cheat code for everlasting euphoria. Chasing the nut like the squirrel from ice age, never able to find the perfect video. Then when the nut came, the clarity came. What the fuck have I just spent the last several hours doing? What on earth is this mess of sweat, lube and cum? The first time I didn't even use lube and yup, the bleeding penis that looked like it went through a meat grinder is for real. Suicidal thoughts became the norm as I tried to clean up the mess I'd made and shove benzos into my face so I can forget my existence. I'd throw everything associated with the act away (only to buy it all again and more for next time) swearing to never do it again. 

The aftermath was always terrible. Days leading into weeks of misery. Throughout all of this I had a loving, beautiful girlfriend who I'd neglect to do this every few weeks to months. I'd justify it as needing to have some alone time to blow off some steam, I'd manipulate her into letting me do it despite her being terrified rightly so that I'd end up killing myself somehow. Of course the effect it had on her and her self esteem was huge, but I was too blind to see, the addict inside of me didn't care. A couple of times we had visitors, her friends came (people who used to be my friends too) and I'd justify taking a little bit of speed to help clean the flat beforehand. I'd do it then reward myself before they came but as you know, there's no quick nut on stims and I'd spend hours stuck in the bathroom unable to emerge as the absolute disgusting degenerate human being I'd become over the course of a few hours. 

Throughout all of this, I'd been holding down a front line job in healthcare through the pandemic. I'm proud to say at least, I don't think it ever negatively impacted my work and if it had got to that point, I don't know how I would have lived with myself. I was functional, between binges I ran a marathon, I meditated almost daily, I convinced myself I had my shit together.

All that mattered to the addict inside of me was that dopamine cheat code, the hours of extreme hedonistic euphoria. My kinks escalated, shoving bigger stuff up my butt, cross dressing, trans porn, anything to boost the dopamine. The drugs escalated, the frequency escalated, the duration escalated. I'd obsess reading over on r/stims about how to maximise my hedonism. 

Then this last weekend BAM, 36 hours in something from deep inside me hit me and made me realise I needed fucking help. I had completely lost control. My girlfriend was away and the only person I could think to call was my sister. And that was it, I opened up to her and my parents and then a select few friends. I realised if I keep going one day I'm going to be post binge, suicidal, psychotic and have NOBODY left to help me pick up the pieces. 

I had lost the person inside of me to this addiction. This stuff is more powerful than I ever could have known. I was smart, kind, successful and productive by any measure of society. I thought I knew what I was doing. I thought I could control this beast. Or at least the addict inside of me thought it could. I couldn't control anything and I've caused untold pain and suffering to my loved ones and myself. The guilt and shame inside of me is overwhelming and sometimes I just want to cry for hours on end. 

I just had my first conversation with a therapist. This is the time I turn my life around. This is the time I close the door on Stimulants. I turn my back on the one way road to hell and start turning towards the light again. 

I'm posting this in the hope that perhaps it stops somebody from going down the road I did. And if you're already on the road then it's not too late, reach out, seek help, listen to your inner self. Before it's too late.

Recently I have been really abusing them. 

Im prescribed 4 x 5mg a day, I’m on other medications for pain management for a accident I had and they just seem to over power the dex and I just start coming down and have to take more, I sometimes take up to 10 x 5mg a day and have so for the past roughly 50 days.

I have 7 tablets left and cant pick up a script for another 12 days (they are meant to last 25 days).

I have been put on this medication because of the heavy sedation of my other medications which have caused my concentration to next to nothing. I have been tapering off these meds the whole time iv been on the dex this time so I want to have a break from the dex or possibly stop all together although I’m just worried about stopping abruptly.

Should I try and taper off with the 7 I have left until my next refill or will I be ok if I just discontinue it and if so will I be alright given iv only been on it for 2 months?

I have discontinued it in the past although I did it cold Turkey along with a few other medications which was pretty nasty although I can’t tell what meds made me feel like that I assume it was all.

Any info or advice would be great.

I got it from the person who promised me they would ever sell to me again.  And she’s like family.  But I know how to manipulate here.  Cause she understands those cravings.  So it’s like easy to manipulate her to give me dope.  It’s fucking sucks because I know I have to cut her out of my like. 

I asked for this.  Like ever since around sept Which is when I first started using years ago.  Iv been romanticizing it in my head.  Thinking about it.  But I always great feel when I wake up in the morning and I didn’t use.  

It’s been ten months and since about sept My cravings have been off the charts.  I never really had many craving just sort of in the first couple months then it stoped.  But these days it always comes in the afternoon. And until Im going to actual sleep. Sometime I think about it on my way to sleep.  It’s insane. I can’t get this stupid drug off my brain.  Weed doesn’t do anything to fill that craving. Nothing does. Maybe nicotine a little b it.  But really it’s like this fucked yo hole inside me that nothing seems to fill or fix it.  

I’m not poly drug user either I smoke weed regularly.  Obscene amounts really I love weed.  I fucking hate drinking and I think I’m Algeria to opiates.  Coke is joke.  Why do coke when meth is like a million times better.  But man as soon I get a taste of that fucking cunt Tina. Fuck it’s all over. I don’t even want to some pot.  When I was using regularly I fucking stopped smoking weed for 2 years.  Cause dope was all I need to function.  


What is the worst is. I thought my days of lying to myself where over.  This time after ten months i convinced myself I just need a reminder of why oaths dope so much.  So that literally became my go to excuse. It’s so lame.  I Manipulated people and lied to myself just to solve some fucking dope.  Blah it’s so lame.  I know this doesn’t have to be a big I can change this I turn. Around a slip can be just a slip. But I’m so mad at myself.

If I am intruding or taking up space I will gladly stay as an observer  as some of your personal experiences have been helpful to understand what my partner is going through.

My partner had been in a faith based rehab program when I met him.  I have a lot of thoughts about such programs, but I will keep those to myself. From what he had shared with me, he attended this program to fulfill CPS requirements ordered by the court, so my initial impression was that he did not have any substance abuse issues. 

After a year of dating, he moved out of this program and housing facility and got an apartment near me. I saw some signs at the beginning that were strange, but did not necessarily concern me. After about a few months things got weird. A big thing that set things off was that he was not earning enough money to be able to sustain housing expenses. There was a lot of stress and I tried to help him as much as possible but it was hard to keep up. Without getting into too much details I thought this was the reason for his behavioral change. 

A lot has happened in the past year and I eventually figured out what was going on. In May, my partner was targeted by users he invited to his house and he was physically attacked and shot at. He ended up in the hospital. This was his ""rock bottom"".  After that he stopped doing meth cold turkey and his entire behavior changed. He was more joyful and positive and for the first time in a long time he was enjoying doing things. He lost his housing because of COVID-19 and his neglect of his work earlier in the year. He was doing a lot better so we made a plan to have him live with me for a short period and once he saved enough money to pay rent at his previous program housing facility, he would move back there since that option was offered to him. 

A few weeks ago, I naively thought we could enjoy a few drinks at the bar. It seemed harmless at the time, but it turned out to be one of the most distressing nights both of us had experienced since earlier this year. He ended up with a broken hand and I had no recollection of what escalated the situation. I recently started meds for my CPTSD and anxiety and did not realize the meds would effect me in such a concerning way. 

Ever since then, things have been very fragile. My partner has relapsed every couple of weeks thinking he can use during the weekend and be ok by the time Monday comes. He doesn't come home to sleep and he shows up the next night still using with no intention to sleep and wanting to have sex. The same behaviors he had exhibited before are back.  

I had a very intense conversation with him last night. He is currently receiving therapy but I know now he doesn't intend to use that space as a way to talk about his substance abuse or mental health. We eventually settled on him finding a space where he could talk about this so I found our local NA and SMART meetings that I will be sharing with him. 

I think overall I just want to ask everyone here if it gets easier, or if there's anyone with similar experience and what they did to find support.

It’s weird, Amphetamines that is. For the longest time I never knew what they were. Until my freshman year in college, when I was handed an XR-30 and had no idea what I had gotten myself into. It was awesome, I felt so great and was on top of the world. Little did I know that it had grabbed me at very moment.

I continued to take adderall throughout college. It was mostly finals where I’d try to save up enough to get a bottomless amount of those “little blue boys” and boy did they get me through. Informatics Major, Econ Minor, everyone thought I was smart. I even doubted myself because I contributed my success to staying in the library until 1 AM because of Adderall. I wasn’t smart, Adderall made me put the work in that no one else wanted to do. It made memorization easy, discreet mathematics and python intro courses? Get out of here, I ate those for lunch. Adderall made college easy, and yes, I probably lost 10 years off my life because of how I treated my body during those four years. Was it worth it? It depends on what day you ask me…

Fast forward, I’m now 27 years old. When I left college, I left the adderall supply and all my connections to the drug behind me as I moved far away from home. I didn’t take a single pill for three years. I was in the clear, coffee and nicotine got me to about 70% of where I needed to be. And at the time I was ok with it. I was getting by, just doing enough to keep my job and stay afloat. And then, I moved back to my hometown.

At first everything was fine. I had a new job, a new girlfriend, a new house, anything you could ask for at 25 years old. Just when you think you have it all that’s when you get comfortable. And that’s exactly what I did. My girlfriend (my ex now) and I used to drink every night. She loved to drink, go to bars on the week nights, the local casino, you name it and I tagged along with her. It wasn’t long before I found myself waking up every morning hungover and waking up to Slack messages from my manager asking if I had certain work done that I hadn’t even started. That’s where Adderall and I met again.

I reached out to my old friends, I found as many pills as I could. It got me by. I could live that lifestyle and still make those deadlines and man I always seemed to just get there in the nic of time. And then all of sudden, I couldn’t find the pills anymore. I was dead, and was falling behind at work. That’s when I started using cocaine until I could find the next batch of adderall. It got me by I guess. My work was complete trash, but I still had a job. After doing this for a few months, I knew I couldn’t keep doing the blow. It was not sustainable, so I did what any other speed addict would do. I went and got an adderall prescription.

For the last 11 months, it has been a roller coaster. Adderall IRs, XRs, vyvanse at all various dosages you can find. I left my alcoholic ex, and met a new girl. My now fiancée. I got a new job for over six figures, I was living the dream or so I thought.

I abused my script to get the work done, to get the promotion, to get to the next level. I always told myself when I got there I would stop the addies. But I couldn’t and I wanted more. I worked and worked and would run out of my script in 2 weeks. I turned into a robot. Neglecting my fiancée and her child from the time they deserve.

About a month ago I realized this wasn’t sustainable. I needed to be better, do better. It’s time to grow up. I’m tired of feeling like shit, having to drink a 6 pack or 12 pack to sleep, and feeling like I can’t live without the pills. And I myself, was turning to alcohol to escape the wrath of the comedown. Not a recipe for success in the long run.

I have two left. My usual dose for one day. Tomorrow is it for me. My fiancée, her daughter and I are going to dinner tomorrow night to celebrate new beginnings. It’s time to get back to who I really am. No more bingers full of adderall and booze.

If you aren’t going to do it for yourself (quit), do it for those who depend on you, who love you, and in my case the little girl who needs a father to love her and spend time with her helping her grow.

As a sit here once again on my couch with a beer trying to fall asleep as I have many of nights before, all I can think is what a ride. I consider myself lucky for not getting in as deep as I could’ve. I know there is a lot of work ahead, but I’m ready for the challenge. I know it won’t be easy.

Thank you to the stop speeding subreddit. I’ve been a lurker here for awhile, you all are truly an inspiration.

It was the most harmful thing I have ever done to myself. I’m clean now, but any time I come back to school the area brings memories rushing back. At home I am outgoing and happy, have a close knit friend group, and even hit it off with girls I’d equate to super models. However at school im depressed, embarrassed, and isolated. These negative emotions all stem from my past. I also lost all my friends at school because I was an anxious wreck. I find it increasingly difficult to establish myself in a place where I almost destroyed my life. How can I get over this and start being outgoing and joyful?",39,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.972569465637207}"

Came to this sub for motivation to stay clean and as always, you guys are helping me keep another 24. Here's something I want to give back to the group...


""Over time, regular exercise remodels the reward system, leading to higher circulating levels of dopamine and more available dopamine receptors. In this way, exercise can both relieve depression and expand your capacity for joy.

These changes can also repair the neurological havoc wreaked by substance abuse. Substance abuse lowers the level of dopamine in your brain and reduces the availability of dopamine receptors in the reward system. As result, people struggling with addiction can feel unmotivated, depressed, antisocial, and unable to enjoy ordinary pleasures. Exercise can reverse this.""
