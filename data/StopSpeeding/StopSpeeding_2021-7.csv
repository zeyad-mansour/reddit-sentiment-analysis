I’m scared. This is my third try quitting, but the first time with anyone else knowing.

So, what’s up?” And I just… went I don’t know, then just… talked about Ritalin. My friend was… he was fucking heaven-sent. He told me that he had no experience with addiction, but he was willing to help with whatever I asked, whenever I asked, and said we can look up online support groups together (he says hi to this subreddit by the way, I told him about it.). He said it’ll be hard for me, but he believed in me. Then he asked me if it’s OK if he looks up Ritalin abuse and side-effects so he knows what’s going to come (said yes), and what’s going to happen with >!weed, drinking, and cigs (first two paused until further notice, continuing cigs.),!< and then he asked if he can sleep over tonight. (yes.) 

So he’ll be coming in about twenty. With ice-cream and >!cigarettes!<. I cried the entire call. That was amazing. I am… beyond lucky to have him. He said he was proud at the end again, and that he loved",38,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9102757573127747}"

He is 51 years of age, he has been using for a year....we dated for 5 years. Is this what you would call a relapse??","I'm looking for some help to understand cocaine use.    I found out that my ex bf of 5 years, has been using cocaine the entire time, off and on, and I didn't know about it.  He broke up with me 3 weeks ago.   I'm trying to understand so that I can accept and stay away?, or to understand if what happened this past year is a relapse?, and that I should perhaps try to help him kick it again.

I know that he has been using since last July (one year) - he broke up with me then, and we reconnected near Christmas-time.   He began using it in front of me, and for the first time ever, I was able to see that when he's on cocaine (snorts it),  he is actually quite pleasant, open and chatty as hell.   I was able to get some closure from previous break-up to understand what was happening in the few years before.   So, here are my questions:

1. he moved in with me in 2016.....a couple months later, he became verbally abusive.....on and off, hot and cold, sometimes he would leave my house for a few days and return and we'd make up.  I assumed he was mad at me.   Is that classic for an addict to leave (maybe because he knew I didn't know about his use?)......and is the up and down behaviour due to cocaine?   Is the abuse (mostly verbal, sometimes physical:  5 times in 5 years) from cocaine comedown that I've read about???
2. Once he knew that I knew he was using cocaine....he started to use it in front of me.  He would say ""I'm going to get high""....and he would go somewhere.   Then, he would come back every once in a while talking and chatting....loving and kissing me.....and then up until ridiculous hours of the night.  I would watch a movie or sometimes have a bon fire with him.  It seemed to be only on weekends.     Is it possible that someone can do that only on weekends?.....return to their day job for the week.....get kind of bitchy and mean.....and then ""itch"" for it again on Friday night?
3. We lived together for only 1.5 years out of the 5.    For a couple months before he broke up with me, he was being very mean when he'd call - fly off the handle about ???? (never really knew what would set him off)....and then I'd go to his weekend spot (trailer park) and back comes party guy, nice to be around....spazzy....energetic...happy.   Then wait until about 2pm for him to wake up while I've been up since 7am.    Then repeat on Saturday.   Sleep all day on Sunday.   Return to work for the week (I never saw him through the week because he was busy or wanted to rest).   Vicious circle, and no fun for someone who doesn't drink or do drugs.
4. His nose bled....and he would snort and hork and spit and this would go on and on for the whole weekend day.   Then he'd snort and say ""do you see how much better I can breathe when I take it?"".

I loved him very much - unconditionally.  I should have ended things the first time he laid his hands on me.   Emotionally he was cruel....that was a regular occurance.   I am like every woman who has been abused......still loving him.   I just wondered if anyone can tell me in general (now that you see the above)......is this a typical cycle of a cocaine addict??   He said it was recreational because it was on the weekend.   I can't find much information on-line.....I seem to find medical sites and hotlines.  I'm looking for information about it, from someone who has done it and knows what the typical cycle is like.....the sleeping in.....and the fact that he's really stopped looking after things.  Covid pandemic can't be blamed for everything - but it certainly got worse this year, to the point he was doing it in my presence (well, behind a door so I couldn't see).

I thought it was going to be the worst thing that ever happened to me but it turned out to be a blessing. I know I would have not stopped using on my own accord. I know that I was spiraling even further out of control. I know that meth was going to kill me (and I was okay with that). But I spent a few days in jail and was fortunate enough to be sent to detox, long term inpatient rehab, then sober living and it changed my life for the better. Looking back at where and who I was 2 years ago is like looking back at an entirely different person. A person I never ever want to be again.

I couldn’t imagine a day going by without getting high and now it’s been two whole years of total abstinence. I still struggle with my lack of energy and motivation sometimes. There’s good days and there’s bad days, but when I was using, it was a bad day every day. I just had the guise of chemical happiness to get me through. 

For anyone out there still struggling, there is hope. You can absolutely do this. There’s so much more to life than living it in addiction, I promise you that. I can feel the whole range of emotions again, I feel healthy and in control of myself, I have love and respect for myself. I wish this for all of you. Life without meth (or any other stims for that matter) is truly a life worth living.

I have a bit of downtime which ordinarily I'd spend preparing my ROA, so I figured I'd fill the time by posting an intro to this sub (I think I've been subscribed for almost a year, so it's about time!)

I started using methamphetamine five years ago, and within a year I went from smoking to slamming several times per day. 

It alarmed me, too, so I put myself into rehab, and three days into it, I decided that I'd had enough, and that it wasn't a good fit and somebody was plotting against me so it just made really good sense to check back out, drop out of the program and go back home (where I would have access to drugs, naturally.)

I know that was just my brain trying to kill me, but it can be so convincing sometimes.

The following year, the same thing happened. My friends who I had before I started using were very concerned and helpful at first, but by now I've disappointed them enough they mostly don't talk to me anymore. 

I don't know why people ditch out on the addict seemingly when he needs their support the most. I don't spend a lot of time feeling sorry for myself, but i didn't intend for all this bullshit to transpire, and whatever pain it's caused them can't compare to the devastation I've already experienced. If I knew that some of my friends, or even one friend in particular, would be waiting for me on the other side of sobriety, maybe gathering my resolve would be easier. As it is, I'm getting used to the idea that everything I do in the name of sobriety I do on my own, with help from those in the program.

I signed up as a test subject in a study about transcranial magnetic stimulation, and today I completed my first week of a four-week regimen. TMS is a kinder, gentler version of electroshock, and is approved for treating depression. 

The study intends to determine the efficacy of the treatment as it relates to the patient's attempted recovery from methamphetamine addiction. I think I'm going to need more help staying off the shit. Everybody in the house where I live uses every day. It's impossible to get around it. And when I try to quit, some of them seem to resent me for it. 

There are some other issues that make things particularly weird, not least of which is the fact that I've been in and out of methamphetamine psychosis during much of the past four years, so I should not necessarily always trust my version of reality, which has become increasingly paranoid and theoretical.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9989258646965027}"

Just recently, like last week I got prescribed 20 mg XR adderall, once a day. It’s been 5 days and I’ve already taken most the bottle. My doctor only gave me 15 to start with. I guess to just see how it works. I feel like it’s not strong enough or doesn’t last long enough but I’m not sure if that’s because I’m comparing it to methanphetamine affects on me. The doctor doesn’t know I am an addict. I can’t get a refill until the 3rd and I’m kind of having anxiety about it. I can count this as a relapse because I’m using what I can to change the way I feel. I haven’t used meth but now I’m just using what I can legally to get the same affects as meth or as close to it as possible. Now I’m addicted to pills. Perhaps not. I can go without them. I mean I’ll have to soon because I’m gonna be out early. I like staying up all night but then I’ll guilt trip myself all the next day. I won’t sleep the following day I’ll just pass out the following night. The pattern is stay up all night, all day then sleep at night. Next day up all day, up all night, then up all day, night time, sleep. So essentially just an all nighter every other day. I don’t feel very high on them because I’m not taking that much. The effects aren’t worth it because I deprive myself of sleep and food, so I get weak or exhausted and can’t sleep so I’m just depleted the next day. So why when I get a full nights rest and eat regularly, for the day, I want to tweak out all night with absolutely nothing to do, and feel like shit the next day? Like why not just sleep at night and take the adderall in the day time? I’m just setting myself up to feel like shit physically and emotionally because I feel guilty. I got clean off meth and completely changed my life to the point where people actually are inspired by my growth and progress just to change direction. I’m self medicating because I’m not taking it as prescribed and I’m not happy about it but I can’t stop. I’m anxious about the upcoming days where I’ll be out because I’m becoming dependent on it.

I know I can’t police him but it’s also really hard for me to just sit back knowing this may be happening. I’m no expert but I feel like this behavior is not conducive to true recovery. I also know he’s going to do what he wants to do and I can’t force anything.

I’m adhd, autistic and bipolar and don’t have access to adhd meds in my country. After taking modafinil on and off for about half a year and building a tolerance to it, I decided to try speed (I’m in Europe and it was tested and it’s amphetamine).

I took about 1.2 grams in total over three weeks, almost daily small doses, mostly in gel caps. I decided to stop because it was clearly a bad idea and I’m building tolerance and getting addicted. I have had addiction issues since I was 13 and basically lied to myself to take it.

I am doing a combo of anti-depressants (prescribed tianeptine in very low therapeutic doses), l-theanine, l-tyrosine, gaba, omega 3, magnesium and ashwaganda. Also, I have been a daily weed user for the past 14 years and know I won’t be stopping anytime soon. 

What should I expect in terms of losing and regaining neurotransmitter function after this amount? The fact that I don’t know what to expect is what’s weighing on me most at this time.

I know over the past few months I have posted on here quite a bit, but tonight I just want to share my story with you. 

I was diagnosed with ADD when I was 5 years old. I took medicine for it all through grade school and some high school. When I was 18 I started smoking pot and drinking alcohol. That lasted until I conceived my first son. I quit everything. 

Fast forward 5 years, 2 kids and a newborn, I started messing with opioids. Decided to get help after 6 months and haven't touched it since. 

Two years ago I got so overwhelmed with 3 kids, no support, no engery, drained all the time I started concerta. As we all know one day one pill didn't work so I took another one. And so worth. Up until the last 5 months my prescription only lasts a few days, here recently it's been 2 days. I will stay up 2 days straight maybe 3 and hate myself when it's all over with and repeat next month. 

Last week I was having a good week, happy, ECT. Then I got my script. Same thing.. I promised myself I wouldn't make myself stay up all night because it really does sucks. Well  between Monday and Friday shit hit the fan. Friday morning came and fuck I had been awake for four days. I felt like total shit. I couldn't sleep no matter how hard I tired and I was extremely sleepy. I decided to keep redosing all during the day because I knew I was going to be busy that evening. Praying every pill I took to please work. Well 2pm came and it was almost time for me to leave. I don't know what the hell I was thinking but I took 7 52 mgs and swallowed them at once. Not even sure how many I had already taken that day. I left my house got to my destination at 4 and totally fucking lost it.. my anxiety and depression was beyond sky rocket. I have never had a panic attack so bad in my life. Hyper venting until I could honestly almost not breath. Then my forehead and lips went numb. I felt like I was going to die. It made me panic even worse. I finally managed to get back to my house and take some anxiety meds. The attack stopped but omg my body hurt so bad. Muscle twitching and cramping. Hurt so so bad. After about an hour to an hour and a half the pain just stopped completely and I felt higher than I ever have in my life. I felt like I couldn't stop moving, I was talking so fast and it was ok for 30 minutes then I just got pariod and wanted it to stop so I could go to sleep.  I ended up going to the er and when I got there I was in so much pain my feet would not stop twitching and moving. And I was crying again. They gave me something to make me sleep, but the whole time I was hallucinating and seeing all kinds of stuff and going crazy. After a few hours I decided I had enough and told them I was going home. I went home 4:30 in the morning and slept until 10 am Sunday morning. I woke up still very very depressed and sick. I begged my mom to take me back to the hospital. She did, and I was there from Sunday to Friday. Working on my depression.

I just want to tell everyone who abuses stimulants that this was the darkest most worse days of my life. If you are addicted and want to stop please get help. Your life is worth so much more than this. I promise you. Don't wait until it's to late like I did. I honestly thought I was going to die. 

The hospital took me off the concerta and I have no desire to ever abuse it again. Please keep me in prayer I really appreciate it.

What a relief!,"I've been speeding for 4 years now, and i quit today. Initially I only did it occasionally, to help me study (I've got ADD) and not fall behind in my engineering classes. At my university stimulant use is so widespread in the STEM fields that I could just stand up in the computer lab and ask if anyone had  any Adderall or whatever and be guaranteed to have an offer. 

One thing led to another in that first year and i eventually bought a massive amount of meth wholesale. I didn't think i was addicted because i never craved it or enjoyed it, hated how bad it was for my insomnia or my sex drive, but just did some every morning to help myself study and focus. I'd stop whenever i didn't have school, or didn't spend the night at home, and thought that was all there was to it.

This past year, the isolation of the pandemic, being at home all the time, and having no real interruption in it led to me using it every day and developing a massive tolerance, and subsequently using massive quantities of meth.

My mental health has severely declined in every measurable way. My memory is shit, my ability to focus, my cognition, my ability to regulate my mood, my impulsiveness is thru the roof, I'm insecure and perceive any slight issue as catastrophic, depression, anxiety and insomnia are all so much worse. i don't really enjoy many things as much anymore and if i do enjoy something, it doesn't last -- even an hour later i might have well have not had that enjoyable experience at all. 

My pre-existing PTSD symptoms are all severely aggravated, and I've not been able to get as much out of therapy.

Today I asked my partner for help, and we flushed $10K of meth down the toilet. I was looking forward to getting rid of it but i still had a panic attack watching it happen, and then a huge wave of relief washed over me. 

I didn't realize just how much i was looking forward to today! I'm exhausted, and now I'm looking up supplements and activities to try to repair my serotonin and dopamine levels in my brain and try to turn my life around. 

Wow.

EDIT: 2021-08-24  Guys+gals -- I just wanted to update and say that I'm over a month clean off of speed, have stopped drinking for a while, lots of exercise and eating right and finding healthy physically active things to do, etc. My life is *SO* *MUCH* better in terms of my mental health and being able to handle hard days, and I'm forever grateful for the resources and support that I've found here, and in other non-12step addiction recovery resources!

I’ll give a little timeline of my 50 days and how they went. 

Days 1-7: these were the initial withdrawal, shit was terrible, pretty much dysfunctional.

Days 7-21: gradual return of some energy and some personality. At this point I started smoking some weed almost every day, mostly at night for sleep aid.

Days 21-40: these were my good days. I was starting to be myself again and I really enjoyed some activities like playing tennis with some friends and would do it every day, and while I was doing things I enjoyed I felt like I was my normal self. Pretty awesome. 

Days 40-50: I got Covid. Symptoms hit me pretty damn hard and I returned to the couch for most of my time. This was my first real challenge I had to face while I was in my withdrawal. Definitely made me realize I am not over this withdrawal yet because of how I handled this challenge. 

Now here I am 51 days clean. I will say I’m not completely better. I find myself struggling to keep up with my hygiene, like brushing my teeth, clipping my fingernails, and I definitely don’t shower as much as I should. I even find myself struggling to take my allergy pill every morning (I have really bad allergies). Most of this is because I just don’t care for some reason. All of this has gotten worse now that I’m not playing tennis because I’m recovering from Covid, and I think this shows the importance of finding something you love doing and doing it. If any of you guys are finding it tough to get off of the couch to do things, I highly recommend trying to make yourself do fun things and give yourself some recreational time.

Then years later at ridiculous daily dosing the withdrawal is so different. First Day or two ok. Then tiredness ramps up but not depressed at all just meh. Then day 5 every time, extreme anxiety hits and can't sleep lose appetite. Butterflies nonstop, heart beating faster. Maybe it's panic? I don't know. Then weirdly will feel at peace around day 10 but I'll be extremely impulsive and spend lots of money or have an embarrassing upset emotional reaction, or have bursts of euphoria, or be excited unable to sleep. none of which I experience when abusing the prescription or before starting it.

I spend July 5th at another hospital where I told them my story, “I am an addict, I used meth primary, but I recently did 2 bags of “heroin” and my chest hurt. “

This is based on the hospital notes from my record. I spent most the day there and I have absolutely zero memory of this. I only found the records while looking for my proof of my vaccination.  

I have few memories prior to the weekend. It started when I terminated treatment late last month. 

I’ve been in the hospital since the 6th, but my first memory is of the tube being pulled from my throat in the ICU on the 11th.

They say I died and I believe them. 

From what I can tell by videos on my phone, hospital records, roommate (and my mother) it appears I acquired some  “heroin” [fentanyl] while on a meth-binge. I was in some type of fugue-state. 

There’s a chilling vid of me nodding off in my undies. (The sounds that came out of my throat are worse than the images). The video is 31mins long but I sat hunched in that position, with my back against the door, leaning on my right side for hours, and hours more.

aside from this intense, searing, and mind boggling pain in my foot I can’t feel anything nor move it. There are patches of numbness going up the right side of my body with various wounds where my skin made contact with the floor, cabinet, or door. My right hip and ass is still huge and hard from the swelling.

I needed to write this. It takes my mind off the pain.

Edited typos and to add that I’ve been using ‘drugs’ for 30+ years. The only breaks was when I went to The Programs for various periods of “clean” time (which for me is swapping obsessions. Eg., food/sex). 

I’ve never been so in love with anything like I am  with Crystal (IV) and I’m not sure I’m going to make it out alive. I just asked the doctor to amputate my foot because I’ll never make it if this pain continues this way…

He's still using, which is a challenge I've shared a few times in here; he had spent a lot of the night helping color my hair, then recoloring the parts that didn't get enough dye. After he reapplied the color, we were watching the Average Homeboy video, which reminded me that we needed to pay the power bill lol.

I should've gone myself. Soon after calling me to have me confirm the money cleared the account (we were probably days-hours from disconnection) he called me again for the car insurance log in. I already knew what was up but I had hoped he would make it home somehow. He stopped answering, so I dragged myself out of bed into the cold shower to rinse my hair, shower door open so I could watch the camera- I wanted so badly for him to pull up. I shamelessly used hot cheetoes to coax my oldest (special needs) kiddo to get dressed and hop in the car so we could go save his from being impounded.

I rushed, crying, across the crosswalk with my kiddo still licking her fingers, walking at snail's pace an arm's length behind me, and talking about seeing his car. I approached the cop- which is tough for me, because a loved one was shot over 30 times by over five cops that were chasing him after he made a stupid, meth-fueled mistake- and asked if I could take possession of the vehicle rather than it being impounded. My kiddo was excited to see the ""powiceofficuur""...she lightened the mood with her innocence and awesomeness. After I gave him my ID, the officer called my SO to ensure he was ok with the car being released to me.

I can't drive standard transmission, so I lied to the officer and said a tow truck was already on the way. He set out some flares and took off. I called each tow company, til one responded. $110 to take it 1.8 miles away. When he arrived, I knew he was a tweaker, lol. Finally got my SO's car home...he loves his car, he's put a lot of work into it, so I felt mild success. 

After I'd checked his charges, reviewed his online records, and deposited some money onto his account so he could call me at some point, I got a text. My 93 year old grandfather passed away. I hadn't talked to him or anybody in my family for years since I relapsed, but I was actively making plans to visit gramp and my dad with my kids this month. I'm devastated; I had put off sending him pictures because I only had old ones. I dyed my hair purple (my favorite color) and pink (my gramp's favorite color) and I was excited to take new pics and show him- and even more excited to show him in person. Now I'm just sorry, so fucking sorry, that he didn't ever even see pictures of us all together like he'd asked me to send way back in October, before I got sober. I'm sorry gramp.

I wailed when I heard the news, so my middle kiddo came to comfort me. I told xem about what had happened and xe consoled me. My youngest woke up and came eyes-wide to my bedside. I had to tell her that her daddy was in jail and I don't know when he'll be out. That fuckin sucked. Shortly after, my SO called, asking me to pay as much of his fines and bail as I can, despite the fact that his no-bail bench warrant would keep him inside til he goes to court. I forgot to say, this happened on Thursday. That is the worst day to be arrested in my area because the courts are closed on Friday, so he is stuck in there til next week. 

I went to the justice court and tried to pay his fines- they wouldn't take my money (that he OWES), because it is in warrant status. I reminded them that I knew he wouldn't be released, but he still owed the fine...they couldn't help. They went on to say that they can accept it after he sees the judge, which will happen on Monday or THURSDAY. We've both only been arrested one time- he spent a few hours in jail, while I spent a week. He had spent that whole week getting money to bail me out. I've always laughed at his memory of his few hours in jail, because what did he know, right?! Now the thought of him having to be in there a whole week is saddening to me. 

Then I went to municipal court and paid the bail for his warrant. The clerk set a court date for August. If the worst-case scenario happens in his justice court case, he will have to serve 6months in county jail, rather than the city jail he is in right now. I asked the municipal court clerk if the court could/would issue a warrant if he was in custody in the other jail during his court date and didn't get transported...she nodded her head yes. If the worst-case happens, he'd be stuck in jail for 6 months and possibly be sent back to city jail on another warrant and another $1100+ bail. 

Finally, the clerk asked for my ID to issue the receipt- she needed this information. I  had left it at home in a rush to get to the court. I searched in my emails and files in my phone for a copy of it, but I had none. Eventually she asked if I'd ever been arrested, so I gave her my info and she said I looked like my booking photo but my hair now is even cuter. Our arrest is the most traumatic memory I have in my life (and I have a lot), something I still can't get over after all these years. 

Sorry for this ridiculously long ass post. Jesus, maybe I need therapy or something, lol. My kids were super sweet to me after I got home, and I'm enjoying time with them. We had ice cream for dinner and then they made soup for dinner-after-dinner. It has been completely shitty for the past 18ish hours, but I made it to day 50. I miss my SO though and I won't lie, I hope this time he spends in jail will be a head-start to his sobriety- but I won't hold my breath.",9,{'transmission': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9798799157142639}"
2021-07-23 03:04:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/opx1u1/i_am_addicted_to_adderall_but_ive_finally/,"I am addicted to adderall, but I've finally achieved so much I have wanted to","maybe you all have heard the same questions, but I haven't - so, here I am

I was put on adderall at around age 25 because I simply felt better on it (and because I straight up asked for it and for whatever my reason my doc was like ""ight sounds good bro"" and gave it to me). I wasn't entirely lazy, but all the procrastination, social anxiety and humming and hawing about life I did sober in certain situations disappeared with adderall. I was finally able to achieve all the things I wanted to achieve...this is especially true in creative endeavors; I am now a fairly popular person online in a certain niche partly (perhaps mostly) due to the focus adderall provided me. 

The issue is I don't give a fuck about much without it

I feel bad about that

But I also feel bad about taking my measly 7.5mg IR adderall (by that I mean taking it 4-5 times daily and running out of my prescription early and waiting 2 weeks in my bed being somewhat miserable until my refill)

I'm not saying I'm special, but I have talents for sure - and I feel like literally if it wasn't for the fucking adderall I wouldn't be doing the things that I love and have so much recognition from people and have the ability to create works that I'm truly proud of.  I am SO proud of the shit that I have accomplished, and it isn't about the attention - I can't get into specifics but all I'll say is that the information I am sharing is very important to a lot of people and the idea that millions have seen my work around the world because of my newly found focus is just....I can't even explain it

But...I feel bad that I'm taking adderall

What if I'm just living a lie? Like I don't even remember what my life was like without it, especially since the two weeks I endure after I run out early isn't really living life at all...it's just.....waiting

2 weeks worth of ""hey man, love your work! where you been? can't wait for the next vid!"" 

what am I supposed to do? respond ""hey bro thanks so much for the support; im actually out of drugs so that means my viewers gotta wait for a few weeks until my soul is replenished by a pharmaceutical company and im able to capture that spark for 14 days again""

at the same time though, in a way - and this is what kills me - part of me feels like i'd commit to a life of laziness and procrastination if I didn't take adderall. And I don't mean an entirely unproductive life - like not working, never getting a job, etc - I mean a life where I never fulfill my deepest dreams and desires;  a life where I KNOW I can do more than what I am currently doing.

A conventional job or career has never fulfilled me. I want to emotionally effect people; I want people to view my work - my videos - and be moved by them. I don't want to simply go to work and come home everyday. When I first tried adderall at around age 21-22, I realized what I was capable of....but is that real? is it a drug-induced hallucination? Who gives a shit, hundreds of thousands of people enjoy the things i create OUT OF NOTHING. It isn't even attention on me, either (for those that may fairly assume this is a vain endeavor where I'm obsessed about how people view me) - my work does not feature me as the main feature. It is a feeling that is unrivaled, the idea that I have influence over what others think, and that thousands of people at any given time are going about their day waiting for me to create a new video. 

Some of you may say ""if you love what you do, you can do it without adderall"" but actually the fact is that yeah I love it, but it requires an INSANE amount of work that to be honest I'm not entirely sure is possible to be done while I am sober, not for me at least. Well, let me rephrase - of course it's possible to be done while sober. Here's the thing though: I DONT FUCKING WANNA DO IT WHILE SOBER

Does that make sense? 

Sure, plenty of other ppl make videos like me....but really, idk if I can do this shit sober. I go back to feeling like ""who gives a shit?"" or ""what's the fucking point of all this anyway?"" and revert back to just doing the 9-5 bullshit while simply CONSUMING content without ever doing what I like which is producing it - without adderall, I would never go the extra mile because why would I?

Before adderall, I was completely sober, but was mystified as to why I had such big dreams  (which were actually fairly attainable btw....given the fact that I have achieved them while medicated) couldn't attain them. How hard is it to sit down in front of a camera and fucking record yourself? 

It isn't. But for me, I JUST DONT GIVE A FUCK IF I AM SOBER

Fuck going the extra mile outside of work - I did my duty, right? I worked for the man from 9-5 and then I get to watch cool TV shows with flashing colors and funny celebrity people all night until I sleep and repeat the next day - who cares about the extra mile? I'm not capable of producing anything would enjoy, right?

No offense to people who do that, but I'm gonna be frank - I feel like I'm meant to be providing entertainment for people as evidenced by the massive success I've acquired while doing exactly that on adderall. And yet, without adderall, all i do is go to work and then come home and do very little - nothing that would impact society in any meaningful way. I find myself unhappy about that, and yet I CONTINUE DOING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BUT CONSUMING AND LAYING DORMANT.

I'm terrified that without adderall I will just be nothing. It has really helped me actually give a shit about the dreams I have in my mind - and the ACTUAL SUCCESS I have experienced as a result is making it very difficult to figure out whether or not this shit belongs in my life, or not. 

No one is moved by how dope my excel spreadsheets are during my work day....but people ARE moved when I create videos that truly affect them on a personal level. I make thousands and thousands of people happy every day, and the feeling that gives me is just....it's unrivaled. 

uh oh, ran out of adderall - i guess im not making vids for two weeks! get what im sayin?

i almost wanna say that I will take adderall forever because I truly believe that I am capable of more while on it than off it - and this is despite the shitty side effects. That says a lot, huh?

the fuck do i do man? seriously...what the fuck do i do? why do i feel so guilty for being on this shit and yet feel so proud about what I have obtained while on it? I'm not the dude that's missing out on situations on it necessarily (though I have definitely isolated myself and worked on editing/video stuff when I should have been socializing - I have that somewhat under control), I'm not drifting into the world of crystal meth, I'm not taking so much that I'm killing myself or overdosing to the point of heart attack....

The point of this entire post was to illustrate the moral conundrum I am in. Not everyone falls into a ""white"" or ""black"" zone, meaning those who genuinely benefit from this stuff and those who fall into addiction-laden hellscapes where they jerk off all day and do weird shit like bite their nails until they have no teeth.....I'm in this weird middle spot where I feel so great having achieved all I have on it but simultaneously feel fucking terrible for taking drugs to achieve my dreams to begin with. I feel like, what if I was never interested in creating these videos to begin with? and it was adderall tricking me into thinking i wanted to? but I think back to my life without adderall, and how i so badly wanted to do exactly what im doing today, and yet.....simply did nothing. I never did it. I said it wasn't worth it, i said i'm not good enough, i said who fucking cares about what I have to say? and yet, on adderall, millions of people love me

*please read all thank you*

Technically i started in early june with 1G and i was up for 3 days binging that stash the entire time. 

One month later, july 10-21 i used up 3.5G and I was up for 4 days max, sometimes 1-3 days. 

Total use: 4.5g

I’m not here to brag. I’m here to ask how much, if you could guess, or from the studies youve read, anything, know how much damage I did to my body and brain? How bad my dopamine neurotransmitters are? I only used meth because i was suicidal, wanted to die, so i thought trying meth before i die is something i wanted to do. Stupid choice because i dont want to die atm. I fucked up so much in such little time, i IV’d twice, smoked like 7 times, 8 boofs, the rest were mainly oral and snorting. 

Look, im 20 years old, i fucked up doing this, but i quit for good, no point in more. I say this, and i feel that people wont believe me but honestly i am and i dont need people doubting me. This destroyed my soul, my mind, my sleep, my appetite, my body, my skin, my gums, my vein, possibly the rectum a bit, and the inside of my nose a bit. All in 15 days total. Half a month. 

Is there even a way to know the damage done? I feel so guilty and my anhedonia is so bad that i lay in bed all day, think of suicide, this has to be top 5 worst days in my entire life. The anxiety so bad. Depression x100. I almost went to the psych ward today. 

I know i did too much, do not tell me. Do not tell me how stupid i am, i know. I just want to know the consequences. Its hard to forgive myself. I ruined my ketamine treatment for depression because i did meth. I hope this is the right place to talk about it",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9989663362503052}"

I was abusing the shit out of it, quite frankly, and I was really starting to destroy some personal relationships.

Rewind 6 months ago: I decided enough was enough and quit cold turkey with the support of my family, friends, and therapist.

Then, a few days ago, I was on my way to go kayaking with friends, when the guy I was driving pulled out a bottle of Adderall and offered me some (he didn't know about my problems in the past, it was not his fault). At first I said no, but a few minutes passed and I caved to the INTENSE craving and said yeah, I'll take one. So I took 20mg out on the river, and later driving him home I asked for a bit more ""to help catch up with work"" (lol who the fuck was I kidding though). Long story short, he gave me two more 20mg IRs, which I took immediately after he left, and since my tolerance was nowhere near what it was 6 months ago (which I took as a positive sign of progress toward healing my brain), I did not sleep that night (Sunday). 

In the past, I would have definitely hit him up that Monday and asked for more. But something in me this time said, ""fuck that."" I decided  I was not going to use a little slip up as an excuse to completely give in the addict inside me and go ""well my streak is over, might as well do some more now that I'm back to zero,"" which is something I've done many times. But nope, this time, I called my boss and took a mental health day Monday, ate healthy, took a bath, relaxed, called my therapist, and now I'm sitting here Wednesday night feeling good.

Just wanted to share this anecdote for anyone else struggling. One slip up does not erase all your progress. It can even be a blessing in disguise (although I would NEVER endorse doing this on purpose)- I now know how shitty it feels to have to reset my day tracker after my longest ever streak of no Adderall, and it was NOT worth it. But I'm feeling good! I feel like I've made enough progress to where a slip up will not derail me, and I feel like I'm still 6 months into my no Adderall journey, not back at day one. 

Hopefully this helps someone.

Been clean since January 1st of this year. 

Before that, been using on and off for 3 years. Euro amphetamine, and for a month or so, meth. 

You know the story. Undiagnosed ADHD. At first, made me feel whole. For the first time in my life I felt normal. I could finish projects. I could learn new things. I could enjoy learning. I could... blah blah blah. 

After a while it just became binging for the sake of it. I was still doing nothing but focusing on my creative endeavors, but wasn't getting any new results. Just doing what I like for  days on end with no sleep and no result. 

After that, couldn't even do what I enjoyed. Just strung out like a maniac, irritable, paranoid, unhealthy.. You know the story. That's when I finally quit. 

It's been 7 months, and honestly, except a few times, I haven't had any cravings. I don't miss it. I'm glad with my decision. My life hasn't improved, but I'd much rather not use than use.

Like today we were eating at a restaurant we used to eat at a lot and he mentioned this one time we ate there and he had a hair in his food. We laughed and he was like. “Yeah I was completely geeked that day.” 

And my whole body went numb. I didn’t even really finish eating after that. I was just mad. No real thoughts about why or anything. Just anger. This feeling happens a lot. Especially when a certain memory or something is ruined because I find out he was high. 

In reality he was always high for the first half of this year but, just hearing it sends me flying. 

I don’t want him to shut off talking about anything because he kept it to himself and suffered his addiction by himself for a long time and he’s finally able to share with me. But, geeez I get so emotional.

The rationalization to use stims again to work is a fucking lie and It can only lead to me burning down the life and peace I’ve built over the last two years. I don’t want to hurt myself again and go back to that place.

There’s a powerful desire to stimfap and disconnect from everything. What’s waiting for me is guilt, shame, hate, depression, anxiety. Worst of all is the chance I return to using street speed or meth. Shit that literally rots the insides of my body and soul.

It’s hard to find willingness for me to get back to my recovery program and believe there’s a reality without these cravings. I know I need to double down on what’s worked in the past and realize my life is amazing without the stims.

I'm afraid I'll go back to it.

I slowly crept inward and stopped checking in and keeping up. I stopped going to social events and eventually stopped getting invited, as it happens. My friends just accepted that I didn't wanna hang out, and let me be.

But not Luke. Luke checked in with me every morning. He saw me get high and was by my side when I came down. He saw me turn into a shell of a man, and not once judged me for it, or held it against me. He was confused and often dismayed by my actions, but he never got angry with me, and he never lashed out or made me feel bad.

He always made sure I would get out of the house at least twice a day, even if only for a short walk. He knew that as long as he stayed with me I would always have income, would never miss rent, and would never have my power shut off. 

Whenever I had an uplift in spirits and wanted to go out and do something, he happily joined me every time without a second thought. If I wanted to go to a park at 4am, he would be at the door waiting for me with a smile. And he let me enjoy those moments and forget about the hell I was living in.

And whenever I called his name he would come to my side with a smile and a wagging tail, and just be happy and excited to have my company. I completely lost myself, but my dog always knew I was still in there. He never gave up on me, and he was so incredibly patient while waiting for me to figure this out.

Luke, buddy, you have no idea how much your company means to me, what an incredible friend you are and how much you help me. You mean the world to me. I'm sorry I haven't given you all the adventures a dog deserves, but you're not old yet. You have time and plenty of spring left.

(possible trigger warnings?),"My estranged boyfriend (37m) and I (27f) have been on and off for 7 years. He has been to jail many, many times and in prison three times, never for drugs but for stupid crap he did while under the influence of them. He does meth intravenously, almost never does any other drug. I'm not a healthcare professional but I think he is prob pretty severely depressed. When he was in prison he was put on antidepressants and during those periods of time he would talk about not going back to drugs once he got out, but he always failed to follow up with a doctor to get medication refills so he ends up depressed again and goes back to meth to self medicate.

He knows I can't stand drugs, especially meth because when I was 16 my ex tried to kill me while he was on meth (long story and not the point of this post but yeah). So every time he starts using again he starts distancing himself from me and we will go months without talking, we'll text or meet up every now and again but it's just awkward and I can tell he's strung out. I can't give him an ultimatum or threaten to walk away because he will always choose meth. He honestly doesn't feel like he has any reason to quit, and feels like he has nothing to lose. He literally doesn't care whether or not he goes back to prison, he doesn't care about losing me or even losing his 10 year old daughter over this shit.

Like honestly I don't even think he cares if he dies. I'm terrified that he will have a heart attack from doing so much meth, or catch a dangerous disease from using dirty needles, or even get murdered living this kind of lifestyle (he's already been shot once and  that didn't phase him at all). I just feel like he is so depressed that he's willing to put up with all of this just to not have to deal with negative feelings. Most of the people he did drugs with when we lived together have quit, including his daughter's mother which I'm super happy about because baby girl deserves to have at least one parent she can live with instead of being shuffled around between aunts and grandparents. It breaks my heart that he is not even willing to quit for her (I mean I guess I just have to accept that I'm not good enough to make him want to quit, but his daughter should definitely be, especially this kid in particular who is one of the sweetest people I've ever come across).

I don't even know what I'm asking specifically, I just don't know what to do and I can't just stop caring about him because I've tried to do that and all it did was make me more sure that I can't give up on him.",3,{'distancing': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9931132197380066}"

After being on this stuff for five years, and really abusing it heavily for the past couple (even having a 9 day meth binge back in late March/early April) I admitted that I had been abusing the medications. I had recently been in the psych ward after a bad bout of coming off another drug I had been taking with the speed (Phenibut) and I felt like the whole thing would be pointless if I didn't admit what had really sent me there, since the speed was what lead me to the Phenibut and the only reason I took it (I liked to mix them.)

So that is it then. I remember sitting in the hall afterwards literally shaking in fear at the prospect of a future without amphetamines. I remember being furious at myself with a part of my brain thinking, ""WHAT THE HELL HAVE YOU JUST DONE!!!"" This will no doubt be relayed to my psychiatrist and he will refuse prescribing me the medications. I already had a bad incident with Adderall which is why he gave me Vyvanse (since that is less ""abusable"") and then I just abused that. So, this is the end of my five year relationship with speed it looks like. I don't know any dealers or have any connections to drugs. The incident with meth was just a one time chance thing I happened upon and I highly doubt it will occur again.

He's currently living in a residential accommodation you get from the government in my country when you're homeless.
It was a nice room and he really made it himself comfortable in there, he was going to start a job soon. But the rules are very strict.
It's strictly forbidden to have visitors in your room and they check the rooms every day at noon.
 I visited him a few times and strictly left at 8 o'clock.
I never had any problems with being consequent regarding this - Until I got sober.
 I fucked up today.
I slept through 2 alarms and was way to chill about this.
At 12pm, we got woken up by the boss who was barging into our room. My boyfriend got thrown out immediately and now he has to wait till Monday morning until he can get another accommodation. Everything is basically fucked now.
We called his brother who gave us a line and we packed his stuff.
Before we took it, my boyfriend and I didn't feel anything. Now that I'm on it again, I just can't stop shaking my head thinking about how careless we were.
And how careless I was.
Like, why can I only be a dutiful while on stims? Why do I always turn into some antisocial and careless redneck when I'm sober.
I fucked up so badly. I'm so sorry for my boyfriend.

Never mind, they've been falling apart ever since we started seeing each other. 

Anyway, I never asked him to stop. I know better than that. But can't you like....come the fuck to bed? Ever? Seriously, he'll fall asleep anywhere but in bed with me at any time. He'd rather do anything in the entire world than sleep with me. 

And remember, I'm waiting for him (yes, I'm trying to stop). So it is frustrating when he's sleeping in the evening and it is time to start dinner and get the kids to wind down... and I'm having a heart attack because my 11 y.o. gets mad because I used the wrong pronoun (it is never the pronoun I call my child, ever) and because I ask them (her?) to help with anything and I get a resounding ""why should I do something I don't want to do"" and I just want some support. It is frustrating that my SO will tell me to lay down with him and relax, just for 10 minutes, and the 10 minutes turns to 50 minutes and I'm back to being super stressed cause I just wasted all this time and he still won't get up. 

It sucks that I finally remember I need to stop waiting for him, and I tell him that this is the bullshit that drives me nuts: the falling asleep randomly during the day, or in the evening.... but never EVER coming to bed and fading out next to me. And the tone of his voice, I want to die just thinking about it, when he says, ""I'll go to sleep Whenever the FUCK I WANT!""

It sucks so bad for him to wonder why I'm sad, but trying to let it go as he rushes off to the garage as I'm settling into bed. It hurts so bad for him to say that everybody (?) is mad at him and everybody (??) wants his attention but nobody (?!?!) cares about what he wants. I care.

I tell him how much that means to me and how awesome he is because I really do think the fucking sun shines out of his ass. Still. 

That is why it sucks so so bad for him to say I don't care. I've cared more about him than I ever have about myself and shamefully, I admit, sometimes even my kids. I have so so much to fix.. codependency is one of the problems that ebbs and flows. I have so much to fix in myself and it hurts so bad to know, deep down, that this almost certainly cannot work- not this time around.

2021-07-13 22:01:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/ojueza/3_years_ago_today/,3 years ago today,"I was looking out my window on a bustling bright sunny day with streams of people and young families milling about. They were smiling and vibrant. They seemed so  happy and carefree. From my living room window they were less than 10 metres from me and yet they felt so far away. In that moment I had never felt more alone or more afraid.

It was mid morning on a Sunday and I had pulled up from a 5 day relapse the night before. My 8th time relapsing after 90 days of sobriety in the past 6 years. My partner was next door packing her suitcase. My children whom I’d seen for the first time in 9 months just a week earlier - most likely wouldn’t see me the following weekend as planned. I couldn’t call my Dad or my Mum or my Brother and tell them I’d relapsed yet again. I felt utterly alone. A sense of panic and dread mixed with a shattering sense of loneliness that is hard to put into words.

For over 6 years I had tried again and again and again to get and stay clean. I had abstained totally for over 3 months on 8 seperate occasions. I had been to hundreds of AA and NA meetings. Been to 3 inpatient rehabs. Seen multiple therapists. I had tried moderation and controlled using and hypnotherapy. And nothing seemed to work. I couldn’t use successfully and I couldn’t abstain successfully. And through every relapse my addiction progressed and took more from me. First it was my marriage. Then it was my job. Then it was my career. And my financial security. When I picked up meth - everything accelerated and I lost access to my two boys and everything I held dear. 

And here I was yet again - I’d just got 90 days up. I’d seen my kids for the first time in 9 months. My Dad was communicating with me. My partner felt comfortable enough to visit her family overseas for a week. And I picked up. And 5 days later everything was in ruins. Yet  again. 

But somehow this was different. It was different and it was worse. It was more overwhelming. I was more afraid than ever before. And more alone than ever before.

I didn’t know it at the time but I had reached a point of surrender. I was done fighting. Done trying to do this on my own. Thinking I could fix this on my own. It wasn’t even about using at this point - it was much bigger than that. It was a profound sense that I couldn’t do life on my own. I was lost and I needed someone or something bigger than me to show me what to do and how to recover.

As I had done hundreds of times before - I went to an NA meeting that morning, just around the corner from where I lived. I walked out my front door feeling shaken, scared and alone. And as I walked towards the community hall where the meeting was being held I felt the slightest hint of hope. A tiny slither of relief that in the worst moment of my life - I knew where I needed to go. In that moment - the only place I wanted to be was in a room of other addicts who were coming together to support each other in trying to get and stay clean

Since that morning I have done 1096 consecutive meetings. I’ve seen my kids every fortnight for 3 years and never missed a visit. I’ve passed 50 drug tests. I’ve become an active part of a community of recovering addicts where I live and I give back through service and by speaking at rehabs once a month.

My partner who was leaving 3 years ago is my wife and we have a beautiful little baby boy who is 8 months old tomorrow. I am totally abstinent from all drugs and alcohol and I love being that way.

If I can leave one message for any addict who is struggling today it is simply - don’t give up. There is hope. You are not alone. No matter how bad it may seem, it can and it does get better. 12 steps is not the only way to do it but it finally worked for me when I gave in and followed all the suggestions. You should do whatever works for you. But don’t do it alone. Reach out for help if you’re hurting. And don’t give up.

Well that has ramped up to 80-100mgs per day for the last 2 weeks, and I am just pissed at myself. Amps were never a problem before, and now, it has become one in 2 short months. I've joined a sober group, they know about my prescription... And it doesn't even do anything for me anymore, just anhedonic all the time, in my room on my computer doing shit all day. 

I sleep taking trazadone or gabapentin at night to sleep, rotating so that I don't face withdrawal issues from them, and eat everyday. Maybe I am psyching myself out. I just know that shit will hit the fan, just a matter of when. 2 months isn't that much in the grand scheme of things and I know for certain I have to get out asap.

Daily user about 3 months now I think. I need to stop. And I really can't tell anyone, or ask for help. I've been to rehab for other substances. I've kept this hidden. It has to stay that way. Clearly people in my life know I've been addicted. But not to this. I promised I wouldn't do this. 

I got really deep in it. But by divine intervention, some of that has changed for now. 

I am having one of those days where I think I've hurt my body and even though I thought I didn't give a fuck. I'm scared. 

I'm freaking out. Anxiety like I've never felt. And I'm afraid it's because I used less today. I think I've stayed high and then medicated to sleep... that I haven't felt even a touch of coming off this shit after 3 months. I've binged a few other times. But for a tiny fraction of the time. 

I have been pulling back. Not smoking before I even get up out of bed. Waiting a few hours. Making a little be a lot... and I've been feeling great. 

But I hit something today. Probably a touch of a physical thing... that my brain ran away with. And everything I've been suppressing since the day I picked up my first 8 ball came at me like a freight train. 

I've been in a state of near constant panic, except for the hour ish after I decided to see if I was indeed coming down... and smoked. 

I know I'm killing myself. I didn't fucking want to smoke today. It grossed me out... and I'm really addicted. 

I'm not afraid to come down... I have medication to help me. I'm afraid of what I'm going to have to face and feel and I'm afraid things will fall apart without my being on top of really importation things right now. Legal shit that my mom can't deal with. 

And even if I'm completely fine physically. One day I won't be. And people might need me more then than they do now. 

I have the age old dilemma.. the one I always have when I want to quit. I have a stupid amount of product. 

I can sell it, but that will take some time. And it's too much product to flush. I've flushed a few balls once... and this is a much bigger uh, situation. 

So, my experience has been that no one will read this. Or respond and that is OK with me this time. I have been shown as clear as day that I am the only consistent in my life. Until today... meth was consistent enough that I thought I had found a solution. Funny I would do that AGAIN. I have made many other substances the solution. They all leave me... just like people leave me. My abandonment issues come up in my fucking drug use 🙄 😆

So, I have to make some decisions. Most importantly, do I want to live or die. I'm not actively suicidal. But I am trying to cut my time short with meth for sure. I'm trying to find my reason to stay. I'm really struggling to find it. 

I would like to end this tomorrow. I could... but I doubt I will. I am afraid of what it's going to take. If I didn't have benzos and seroquel I would probably feel differently. Funny once I got enough Xanax in my system that my physical symptoms are 90% gone.

I was prescribed Adderall five years ago and to this day I regret it. For the first couple of years I took it as prescribed but by the end I was abusing it pretty badly, and I have a very sensitive system. Drugs in general seem to hit and effect me a lot harder than most other people.

Fast forward now I feel completely broken inside. I have no focus anymore, can't seem to ever do anything despite having my thoughts be all over the place, am constantly dissociated. I just feel like I'm crippled. Ironically I feel so much slower now. Everybody else it seems to me is busy being productive and my brain feels so fucking fried I doubt I could even hold a job. I have completely stopped my artistic hobbies, not because I don't have any ideas, but simply because I can no longer push through the mental fog to do them. Even when I am on speed I just end up browsing through the Internet or tweaking out. In the beginning it was able to help me...now I feel like I am f&cked.

Not to mention I have been on a host of other drugs that I feel like has contributed to my current mess. SSRIs, I had a recent bout with the drug Phenibut that ended in disaster, and now I am on benzos. My life just sucks and I feel like it is over for me. I just sit in my room on the computer now doing nothing. Again, I have a ton of thoughts in my head, but the speed has just made it impossible to act on them.

I feel like my brain is broken and that there is just no hope for me. Throughout high school I never drank or smoked weed even once. I can't believe I have ended up here with absolutely nothing. Now I just have to wait and suffer through the endless bouts of anxiety and depression until my brain reorganizes itself. It sucks so bad. All the wasted time is what keeps getting to me.

I think it was, in addition to the high, the initial productivity that fooled me like so many others. It is weird too because I keep relapsing even though a lot of the euphoria is now gone.

I'm at a cross roads here yet it feels like a roundabout and i'm just going in circles. I'm open to any suggestions, similar stories, encouragement, anything really.

I know I can't save the world wether I stay clean or not but if I get clean and stay clean I can do my damndest to try.

Slowly progressed to very small doses of meth (put into an empty allergy spray bottle with water and only allowed 4 sprays 3-4x a day). I was clean for two years. Started fucking around with Adderall and then smoking meth (I never ever would smoke. Too imprecise to dose, takes too long, too complicated, so much equipment, smells bad, and really just want to smoke over and over again). I've stopped the meth a couple weeks ago  after a few days binges for a month or two.

Anyway, I'm trying to also stop my Adderall. But I'm so fucking tired and I feel so bad for my son. It's his last summer before he starts school and does that forever and then moves out. I want so badly to enjoy summer with him but I feel like if I don't use meth or Adderall at all, then I'm going to be spending the rest of the summer asleep or half asleep when I'm not at work. I desperately want to be totally clean but I feel so guilty for being so exhausted...

Do I taper down and use super low doses for the rest of the summer and then when he starts school, use that time to be absolutely wrecked with sleepiness? 

P. S. I do have his father with us finally, and he's a super supportive partner and wonderful father. However, he has worse addiction/drug issues than I ever have.

She is very unpredictable and it’s honestly making me afraid for my family’s safety. She knows she needs help, but when it comes time to get help, she bails. She has tore down every light fixture in the house and has brought everything from the shed-including the lawn mower- inside of the house. She has put electronics in the washing machine because she believes there are cameras in them. She believes there is a gun propped up on top of the shed. And when we go into a public place, she believes that someone in said public place is someone she knows, but wearing a wig. My mother and I are at a loss for words. We don’t know what to do anymore but we are scared. We are scared for our safety as well as her safety.

The following three and a half years have been like a ticking time bomb set to go off every three months, give or take a couple of weeks. It will happen on a random night, I'll be drunk AND coked out(never just drunk, it literally only happens with cocaine) and then the bright idea will come to my head to go get slammed with Tina and find some rando to spend the night with.

Then I'll make up some BS story to my loved ones about where I was and why I was just walking into the apartment at 7:00 am.

I've made the decision to start being open about my issues, as I now realize that no amount of sheer willpower, and proper planning or blocked apps are going to fix this for me without me quitting blow. I have to quit cocaine for good, and that's going to mean making people aware of that.

So my question is: what the hell am I addicted to?

If the meth stuff never happened I would literally have no negative repercussions of coke. My usage has actually gone wayyyyy down since college too, now it's only twice a month, maybe.

Am I addicted to coke? Do I just have a general drug problem? Am I a potential meth addict?

2021-07-04 23:14:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/odyot6/my_journey_to_the_depths_of_hell_and_back/,My journey to the depths of hell and back.,"First off let me preface by saying that I have 14 months sober from meth. I've been using since I was 19 I just turned 40 last month. This is not the first time I've had 14 months sober.

My addiction to crystal meth started at a rave in Texas. I was given a pill called a white devil. Fast forward a year I'm in a small Midwest town and I get introduced to bathtub crank. I started manufacturing crank on my own. Within 2 years I was married and what started then was my real introduction to the met scene.

When I first started using meth it gave me a little energy and a different perspective on life. When I got married we began using together and having really lured sex. The sex was great mind-boggling actually. Me and my wife were married for 7 years. The first two years or so I begin to feel like I was being proposition to join a cult. I was young and so was my wife I thought that people wanted us to bring young people into the fold break them in sexually and then pass them up the chain. I was really into the kinky sex and really into the idea of getting more of it. One day me and my wife were at a party and I'm sure we would have started having orgies at this point. But some children walked in the room and there was a look on their face of just sadness and defeat. I decided if something was propositioning me I didn't want to be a part of it anymore.

This is when my psychosis begin. Now even though I had turned my back on this supposed cult which I thought could read my thoughts I was still into kinky speed sex. Well I believe due to my desires I compromised both me and my wife sexually. I think the repeated exposure to my lured sexual styles always role played LED my wife to seek outside partners. Now remember I was manufacturing meth and I was hanging out with meth manufacturers.

I started noticing things happening around me. Bits and pieces of time where people would keep me separated from my wife. I noticed that I would be giving dope a lot of times and bad things would happen.

This cult that I speak of. It was like they would give me my darkest desires. The only commitment I had to make was to be quiet go along with everything and let other people do what they want to do. I learned quickly that my darkest desires which were lust related were my own but not the only darkest desires that people have. I believe that these people just do the most depraved things to each other and to others. It's an unspoken truth and a unwritten law.

Me and my wife split up. I still don't know what all played a role in that. This was back in 2008 what started then was the real result of my meth addiction. I entered treatment in 2010. I moved to Oregon in 2012 and relapsed. This episode was like no other the same dark stuff surrounded me. But to a whole new level. I remember the breaking point came one day when I was walking down a path with some friends. I heard one word uttered into my mind it was hell. At that point it was as though some form of terror I've never felt took over my body. I began to flee for my life and slowly dissolve into madness. Then it was if something took control of my body and told me of all of my wrongs and why I deserve to die and it was going to make me carry out my own murder. I fought and I fought against this finally coming to a place at the bottom of a mountain. The spirit or split of my own psyche was trying to force me to eat the rest of the dope I had. I remember smelling an old woman's hair like a corpse and filling all of the feelings of hopelessness and despair that someone who's been left to rot in their old age must feel. I broke mentally and laid down. Then the spirit was lifted from me. It was as if I was given a second chance at life.

This would not be the last time I used dope however. Each time I used it my psychosis became progressively worse.. on top of this it was as if I was magnetized to negativity and when I used I would immediately involve myself with the worst thing surrounding me irregardless of my intent to.

In 2016 I reach a new low. I was living at a shelter and befriended some people. I still do not know how this happened I don't know what happened it's so confusing. Gang members were after me for some reason I think someone paid them possibly to do it I don't know who would have. Very strange things would happen around me. Sometimes I would feel them coming and speak of it. This did not improve my situation nor did the fact that I constantly referred to God and my search for God and something to save me from The wretched place I had conscribe myself to. This ended up with me being in a car with a friend of mine who was a gang member who I believe was ordered to kill me. Something happened he was possessed by multiple spirits. Each time a new spirit would enter his body his face would change along with his voice. It was like the devil was speaking to me. I lost my mind attempted suicide in the vehicle failed. And then it didn't in there I will not go into the rest.

Even this was not enough to get me to stop last year during the coronavirus I slipped up. Once again I had an episode where a friend had become possessed but only by one spirit. I set with the spirit and literally was taken to hell. I would eat food and it would turn to s*** in my mouth. I would drink water and it would parch me like I've never been parched before. I would let water run over my body and it felt as if needles were pricking my skin. I laid down that night thinking I was stuck in an eternity with my own sins. When I woke up the next day I couldn't believe I saw what I saw everything was normal.

Several weeks later I was in a gruesome accident. It was directly due to meth. I had something explode directly in my face. I now no longer can see out of my left eye and I barely have any sight in my right. I was blind for 7 days. But I feel as though this accident paid a debt that I've long since owed.

I haven't been in a serious relationship since the divorce. And I've really been wanting to share my life with someone. But I can't escape my past. All of the lured lifestyle has bled into my consciousness into my psyche. Dating dope and dirty sex have always went hand in hand with me. But I would rather be dead. I haven't felt this lonely in years. And now I realize that a part of me would always run back to dope just to be a companion of sorts.

I want to share this story because I'm clean today. I have the power to choose whether I use or not. And it's sad to say but becoming blind was necessary for me to break the bonds of that drug. But now it seems as though there's no place for me. I feel lost. I've been through so much it's hard to relate to just anybody.

Sometimes I walk the streets just so I don't have to stay in my own head. But the streets aren't the same. The people aren't the same. I'm not the same. God help me but I don't know what to do anymore.

I've had more friends die in the last 12 months due to drugs not just heroin but more frightening meth. 75% of the people I know who died died of meth related circumstances. It's as if there's an extermination campaign happening right beneath our noses. And I feel this every time I've relapsed more and more.

Something I'll say to anyone struggling is these negative energies will pick at you until you can't see anything good in the world. You have to focus on something positive no matter how painful. This was one of the only things that saved me. The fact that I always would try to look on the bright side of life. And even when I couldn't do that I would try to do something for someone else no matter how insignificant.

People on the street think this good nature makes me a Mark or a Vic. The truth is is I'm paying a debt. A debt to life. I wish getting sober was just as easy as putting the dope down and moving on. To be honest I feel like dope has other plans for me. I'm constantly seeking God's protection throughout life on a day-to-day basis to get me through it. I was raised in a religious family. I didn't start reading the Bible till I started using meth.",9,"{'rona': 1, 'virus': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.6565093398094177}"

This is my last post. Thanks for your support this year!","Thank you for all your support this year. Posting here has held me accountable and kept me motivated, but I think it’s time now that I refocus my energy elsewhere. With that said, feel free to DM me if you need some encouragement.

A few notes to share...

I love my job and actually feel I perform better off medication than on. It took 5 months to get to this point, I mean first I had to stop sleeping!

I gained a substantial amount of weight. I think the pandemic exacerbated this because I had to spend so much time working from home. My step count plummeted while every food, even those I didn’t really care for before were all of a sudden delicious. If you are worried about weight gain come up with a really airtight food plan before you quit. Try to follow it 80% of the time and exercise as much as you can in any way that you find enjoyable. 

In order for me to be successful I had to tell my doctor, a few close friends, and my family about my dependance and my desire to break free of it. They held me accountable. This was the scariest part because I felt like there was no going back. 

When I was in the thick of withdrawals/PAWS, my mood swings were so intense my spouse and I came up with the code word that meant “I am sorry, this is not me talking this is the withdrawals/PAWS.” I thank my spouse often for their kindness and compassion because I have been really unpleasant for a good chunk of this past year.

Did I relapse? Not this time around but plenty of times before this. For me telling people and having them check in was the game changer. When I wanted to backslide my doctor refused to prescribe. I think I could’ve convinced him by saying my job was at risk or some other white lie, but I didn’t.

When I was first quitting I took a bunch of supplements. I reduced them and focused on the Mr. happy stack. It is unclear how much these helped. They certainly kept me drinking water! Now I find I am too busy to take much more than a multi and fish oil. If I’m going through an afternoon slump, I take a B-complex with a small snack and that seems to help. I also leaned hard on caffeine for awhile. A few months ago I tapered down to like half a cup a day. I would like to eliminate it completely but I try to avoid “ all or nothing” thinking.

Do I worry about the irrevocable damage I did to my body and brain? Sure sometimes, but I catch myself and both focus on small victories and assign myself a difficult reading or task to improve/challenge myself in a small way. There is no point in dwelling on past decisions, it won’t set you up for success in the present or future.

Thanks again for your support here, friends. Wishing you the best on your journey. Please share your progress, It really gives me a boost!",87,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9928394556045532}"

My struggle with Crystal has been going on for 4.5 years. Heavy IV first two of that. Sobriety spurts in random patterns spread into that. Psychosis in the beginning were just a short event that involved seeing weird and odd things that I thought were happening or around me after being up for a week+ at a time. They involved silly and nonsensical things. The psychotic episodes we're always remedied with the much needed sleep my body was owed. The next day normalcy came back to me. Those experiences lasted for quite a while during my relationship with meth. However, the psychosis eventually took on a whole life cycle of it's own. Exploring my darkest fears. Removing any sense of trust in the world. I now don't know who to trust. I constantly think I'm being set up or trying to be incriminated for the most immoral things. The blanket of this was dropped all over my perception of society especially my communities. I've gotten sober for 6 months and I was promised I would start to feel normal again, think and percieve like I once did. But I didnt. The only thing different was the absence of the usual chaos that came along with active addiction to meth. I'm losing hope. I still can't piece together more than 2 weeks at a time. My addiction to speed is compounded with a raging sex addiction and crazy body dismorphia and eating disorder. The moment I start to feel well in my mental health. My weight gain and overeating takes me right back to that fucking shit that I KNOW gives me the ability to not eat for fucking eternity.

And how it makes me feel. I truly feel the memories of that is the hardest part. Just the thoughts and memories of the sex I've had while high and how I feel like a pornstar must be pushing my dopamine up to a near cocaine provoking level. Nevermind the usual normal triggers. I HATE METH. I LOVE METH. 

I WISH I COULD FUCKING FORGET IT. I FEEL LIKE IM GONNA BATTLING AT THIS PACE AND DIFFICULTY MY ENTIRE LIFE. 

I'm sorry but alcoholics don't get it. Fucking coke heads don't get it. Heroin addicts don't get it. It's so weak in comparison. Meth IS all evil embodied. 

At least I still always have the will and want to be ""sober"" and I think I'll always strive to be. If not, I'll obviously just be butchered up by crystal itself. 

Anyway. End of rant. Sorry 
This was initially pointed towards getting similar feelings on psychosis and how it's changed over time.

My boyfriend is coming up on 5 days clean from meth today.  (Yay!  I'm so incredibly proud of him.)  There's some things I knew to expect - irritability, mood swings, paranoia, and out-of-the-norm habits when it comes to sleep and eating as his body kind of gets back to baseline.  But there's been a few symptoms I didn't expect and didn't see in any of my reading, like his body temperature is SO wildly out of whack that he wants to keep the central air blasting cold but then gets under a pile of blankets and still shivers?

He's also INCREDIBLY touch sensitive right now, like we went to bed last night and instead of our usual spoonfest (he likes to be little, which I've always thought is super sweet because he's an ex athlete and without the drugs he's jacked, haha) he's been like ""do not touch me, at all"" and will just splay out however.  He seems to *want* touch, he'll ask for and tell me he needs hugs and will like reach out for my hand or foot or whatever when we're on the couch, but something about full-body contact seems to just not be the move right now.

IDK, is any of this ""normal""?  And I guess are there any other ""little"" symptoms like this that you don't see on the med withdrawal timelines that I should be on the lookout for?

2021-07-01 06:41:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/obj4y8/i_need_to_write_my_engineering_thesis_but_at_this/,"I need to write my engineering thesis, but at this moment I don't know how to do it without speed","So I'm working and studying at this same time(weekend school, 8 weekends per semester) and in this spring I had a lot of work, and a lot of projects in school to do, so I used a lot of speed to manage everything. I don't do speed for over 3 weeks now, but I'm completely exhausted, even if I don't have so much work to do now, I'm doing this so slow that I still don't have much time(I work on my father horticulture farm so I decide of my work hours myself). I even don't fell like I'm regenerating(I had done something similar two years ago and it took me two months to fully regenerate). And looks like I have only 3 months to write my thesis, but I don't think taking more speed is good idea.  


The other thing is I completely lack motivation to write, for four years almost always was studying and doing projects on speed, without it this was very hard, and my grades were lower. Also, I tried to write something before the hardest season of my work started and I also needed speed to do something, even if I had plenty of time and some energy(I thought it was because in winter I lack energy, but now, I don't know if it was the case). Another problem I have with speed is that I'm overdoing things, yeah, it was great because I learned a lot, but didn't write much, so doing speed to write means that it will take more time than normally, and this means I would have to do a lot of amphetamines.   


The point is, I don't want to do it, even if I'm not addicted(in ""typical"" sense at least), I think it will destroy my health extremely and make me even more exhausted, and my biggest fear is even if I find some time I still will be lacking motivation. Also doing speed means I need to drink a lot of coffee after so I can wake up, but coffee make me nervous so I start to smoke, so shit adds up(caffeine addiction is another thing, it really fucks up my brain and heart, for me, it's just a level lower than speed). The worst part is that in 2020 I was on 10 months long break from amphetamine, coffee and cigarettes, and I felt great, I want to return to this state, but I was sleeping more, so I had less time to work and study (and interestingly stress made me sleepy, so it was also kinda problematic).  
I think about making at least year long break from school but I fear of consequences of this kind of decision(especially financial, like paying for another semester or even more) and also I want to end this as soon possible so I can stop thinking about speed(I also move out after ending school, so I will lose contacts I hope) and don't have this kind of stress on my mind. I just want to fucking end this, and I don't know what to do.  


And for your information, I'm not from the USA, so this same rules probably don't apply where I'm studying (And also sorry for my English :P)",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9994785189628601}"
