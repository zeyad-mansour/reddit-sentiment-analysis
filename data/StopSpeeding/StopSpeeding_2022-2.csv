The hardest part is learning to enjoy working without riding on the wave of the dopamine ""high"" from ritalin. Looking back, this high wasn't helpful because it gave me a false sense of accomplishment. I could spend hours performing useless robotic tasks but the ritalin high made me feel I was accomplishing something worthwhile. 

I took 40-60mg of Ritalin daily from May 2020 after being diagnosed with ""adult-ADHD"". 

Thinking back, my ""ADHD"" symptoms were caused by lack of sleep, stress and emotional conflict. 

I have doubts over whether ADHD truly exists. 

Sleep, diet, stress, environment, bullying etc. can all influence a person's ability to focus and there is zero chance a psychiatrist will look at or help someone correct these things. 

Instead, psychiatrists will ask you a list of questions related to symptoms caused by a lack of focus, if you simply answer ""yes"" to enough of them, you get a prescription.

Anyway, I will keep updating this post, sending motivation to everyone else!",13,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6708125}"

I've relapsed several times, so this time I had a sort've game plan on going cold turkey. I'll lay out the main protocols that I believe made me successful so far for anyone interested:

**2 IMPORTANT FACTORS:**

\- Me posting my initial intention on this sub and being open about my addiction made me feel accountable. Be open with your addiction with someone or on the internet. Keep it real with yourself. Thank you again to everyone who responded with support and advice. 

\- I gave my whole supply over to a friend. 

**Supplements I take every morning:**

* Ashwagandha with Rhodiola and Turmeric (supposed to help with mood and stress)
* Multivitamin 
* B-Vitamin Complex
* Beyond Greens Powder
* Usually about 2 cups of coffee and maybe a cup of green tea later if I'm really tired
* Tongkat Ali (supposed to help boost testosterone levels and give you more energy)

**Supplements before bed**:

* L-Theanine 200mg
* Magnesium L-Threonate 140mg

These are supplements that are supposed to help you fall asleep and relax you at night. I generally have a tough time going to bed, even if I'm super tired, so it's helped me personally. 

**Morning routine:**

Wake up and walk for 10 minutes outside. Sunlight exposure, especially in the morning, has a lot of cognitive benefits, and I can say from my experience it's true! This was the only thing I had planned in my morning routine, aside from taking the supplements, keeping it simple and easy. Did I do it all 7 days? Fuck no. I felt like a lazy moody asshole most mornings. And that's fine. But the 3 out 7 days I did walk outside first thing in the morning, I felt so much better the rest of the day. 

**Exercise:**

I jogged about 2ish miles everyday. 

I'm very aware some people's withdrawal symptoms are worse than mine, and they have an extremely hard time getting out of bed, let alone exercise. I get it. If you can do any type of physical activity, that's a win. A stroll around the block? W. Did half a push-up and collapsed? W. 

**Diet:**

Went buck wild the first 3 days or so. Just ate whatever I felt like. Started to take more control after that and implement 16:8 intermittent fasting, which works well for me to control my hunger. I also tried to eat a fair amount of vegetables and home-cooked meals in general. 

I aim for at least a half gallon of water to help with energy levels + not overeating. 

**Social Life:**

Hung out with friends. Had a few drinks. Made plans even if I didn't feel like it. Helped me get out of my own head once you're around other people. 

**DISCLAIMER: I CHEATED FOR 3 OF THE DAYS!**

I took 200mg of modafinil on 3 of the 7 days. Not a stim, but it felt like I cheated. Whatever though. It made me feel less sleepy and like I had a bit more energy. Probably curbed my appetite a bit. Was it necessary? Not really. I could probably get the same energy boost with a Redbull. 

**Resources:**

Many of my protocols, like waking up and viewing sunlight and supplements, are information I got from the Huberman Lab podcast. A ton of episodes are relevant to ADHD and general optimization of cognitive function. Here's one relevant episode: 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFL6qRIJZ\_Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFL6qRIJZ_Y)

Overall, I'm feeling good on Day 7! My energy levels are starting to get back to normal. My mood is improving. I'm confident going into week two. I'm starting to feel like doing things I like again, like watching movies. 

If you're on the same path as me, you got this! You're capable of doing everything you can do on Adderall on your own and be more fulfilled. Thanks for reading!",14,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.7507485}"

I tried almost every month to quit vaping after month 3 of being sober from stims but no matter how hard I tried, the craving was too much to ignore and oddly was harder to quit than stims itself. 





I was 1 year sober and told myself I would use Dexedrine for a week or so to get myself off of vaping again and I did start off with appropriate use, only going as high as 30mg a day for the first week or so. The first script I was able to make 60 pills last me for 3.5 weeks. The 2nd script of 60 pills lasted me 2.5 weeks. The third script of 90 pills lasted only 10 days which I then used clobenzorex to fill the gap for the remainder of the month. I picked up my refill recently and am at 8 pills today with 2 additional clobenzorex. Each time I tell myself, this is the month I won‚Äôt run out early and each time I am unable to have that self control. 





The idea I had in my head was that if I could quit vaping using dex for a short period I would be healthier. Although I have quit vaping, the stupid doses of Dexedrine and the downers I use to sleep every night are without a doubt doing more damage than vaping was. 





The biggest problem is that I don‚Äôt want to quit. I know I need to for my health. But it helps so much with getting work done which led to a promotion, it takes away the skin pain that I get from showering or getting my skin wet (a life long sensory issue I‚Äôve had) which makes it so I‚Äôm not scared of showering due to the level of pain I am in afterward. I‚Äôm lost here. 








When I quit using over a year ago I was certain that I wanted to quit. It was causing so many issues for me mentally that I wanted to quit. But now, none of those issues are arising aside from not having self control to moderate my dose. I am not sure what I should do.





*also for those who don‚Äôt know, clobenzorex is a dextro amphetamine pro drug that is not scheduled in the us. It eliminates withdrawal when I run out of Dexedrine early and is easy to get, it lasts a long time but I don‚Äôt feel like it really offers the same benefits of dex.",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45880482}"

We had reasoned to ourselves that we really had these symptoms that necessitated medication or at the very least it would be extremely useful to our busy lives with children. 

We both would buy them from people in our past, usually around high school/college times and use them around finals, midterms etc. No long term abuse for either of us then. Flash forward to living and partying in LA we started doing cocaine more and more often, we always have appreciated stimulants as a couple and what started out as buying coke for outings or occasions turned into a consistent weekend addition. I personally was so grateful when I found out I was pregnant because I started to get concerned about the amount we were using and could see a really devastating path of addiction. I was thankfully able to stop cold turkey and had assumed my husband did too. I did not learn until months later that my husband was sneaking around to use/buy coke. It was a huge moment when he shared this with me and I was really grateful for his honesty and rightfully concerned for a while with it being around us in any way. 

When these adderall prescriptions came about it felt like maybe we were just self-medicating with stimulants and possibly getting a prescription would be the answer to all our troubles. I think my husband has managed his use of his prescription more responsibly than I have, but it‚Äôs hard to tell because we basically just jointly use one another‚Äôs as a community pot until our next prescription becomes available.

I do know that I have been using more than he has and I have terrible impulse control when there is a plethora at the beginning of the month. I‚Äôm really starting to scare myself with the mgs I‚Äôm taking and the frequency I will up my intake throughout the month. It feels like it makes me more unstable in my other choices too, to compensate for the high of the day, I‚Äôll drink more or smoke weed more. Then when we run out I am having the biggest mental, physical and emotional crashes, while being a mom. I can tell these truths in the corners of the internet, but I‚Äôm scared to admit them to my husband, because I know that will mean he might or will hold me accountable to making changes. I‚Äôm also scared because he has his own prescription and I‚Äôll have a difficult time mentally navigating that.

Just looking for advice or encouragement if anyone has it‚Ä¶I work up a great nerve to talk to him about it, but slowly start reasoning with myself not to and that it‚Äôs not that big of a deal.

Considering quitting. Has anyone else had this issue?","I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 15 and got prescribed Ritalin. It worked great initially for studying and focus, and also gave me unintended euphoria, but after a month or so it stopped. I kept taking it despite the tolerance and 1.5 years later, got prescribed Adderall.

Despite taking both at prescribed doses, I seem to have developed major loss of motivation, extreme tolerance, and severe withdrawals when trying to stop. My daily Adderall dose now is 20mg IR, sometimes all at once, sometimes 10mg IR twice a day. Many people seem to do just fine on this dose for years, and it worked well for me initially - but as I kept using it daily for years, I developed a striking loss of motivation, and debilitating withdrawals every time I stopped taking it, that seemingly last for months. My focus is not nearly as good as in the beginning.

I don't snort Adderall, I don't stay up all night binging on it, I don't take more than prescribed, I'm eating normally (even gaining weight while on it) - and I still developed these very troubling issues with daily use.

My overall executive function and motivation now are both much worse than they were before I ever got on ADHD medication. The first few months in 2014 when I was 15, stimulants really helped me in school, my grades shot up, but everything went downhill as time went on.

My motivation loss is so severe, that I went from showering daily to 1-2x/week, not doing anything with my life (no motivation to even look for a job or sign up to college) - and even when I did sign up to a pre-college course, I failed it because I had zero motivation to study, despite the Adderall.

I‚Äôve been addicted for 6 years now, and before I came out to my family this January, I was at the point of going through two bottles (edited to remove my meds/dosages as they‚Äôre pretty distinct, but one of them is Vyvanse) in less than a week. Then I‚Äôd spend the remaining three weeks before my next script feeling absolutely miserable, with debilitating ADHD symptoms. 

I mentioned that I finally told my family about my addiction on January 1. I still live with my parents, so my mom and I made an arrangement ‚Äî she doles out my dose every morning and hides the bottles. This has been working wonderfully: I‚Äôm functional, feeling better than I have in years, and I‚Äôve only had the occasional craving. And the best part is that my ADHD symptoms are fully managed. 

Then, last Friday, I happened to find the bottles ‚Äî my mom was hiding them in a box on a high shelf in her room, and she didn‚Äôt tuck them fully away so I saw the lid of one of the bottles peeping out of the top of the box. And before I knew it, I had taken a week‚Äôs worth between Friday and today (Monday). 

I feel so devastated. I‚Äôm not under the illusion that my addiction had magically gone away over the last two months, but I had thought with a bit of responsible use under my belt that the temptations would be more manageable. 

I‚Äôm wondering, is it a completely unrealistic expectation to believe that one day I might be able to take my meds responsibly again? Obviously my mom won‚Äôt always be there to give me my daily dose, and one day I would need to take back that responsibility.

Also tastes bad when I snort or occasionally smoke it but only when I take a xan and finally comedown to bust a nut and be as lonely as I was before. I‚Äôve had issues with coke and crack but they don‚Äôt seem to get me as high as they use to. I recently bought a gram of crack and smoked it and the high was the usual feeling like I just wanted more. The xan went by really quick and I don‚Äôt want to get any more but might.

I haven‚Äôt had a girlfriend in 7 months. The last one was with a married tramp I did ice with all the time she was also an alcoholic that was delusional and we fought all the time, before that it was hookers and crack/cocaine, before that it was an unfaithful chick I was with years on end whom I fought with daily who ended up lying and cheating. I almost got a domestic over her bc she lied to the cops and I didn‚Äôt even tell them she hit me I just pushed her. Case was dismissed but still blew thru thousands of dollars trying to keep her busy. I know money doesn‚Äôt buy happiness but later on found that it sure will get me a cheap hooker.
Thank God, turned out I don‚Äôt have HIV.

Tinder doesn‚Äôt work at all amongst other dating apps. I get no swipes, I can‚Äôt hold a convo, Im 6 foot, and obviously not what they‚Äôre looking for at 260 pounds. Most importantly I cannot take care of myself anymore it seems like I don‚Äôt care about my hygiene. Since I don‚Äôt have any friends or money to do anything it seems pointless even trying to because I‚Äôm under disability. I still live at home, I‚Äôm gettin to be my 30‚Äôs, and I feel like everything is going downhill. I cannot even seem to handle working part time. Also time is going by a lot quicker as I‚Äôm getting older. I‚Äôm just not happy.

Also I cannot inherit a dime when my folks are pass bc I‚Äôm on monthly benefits for disability. Aside from that I‚Äôd probably blow thru it all so fast I couldn‚Äôt blink. I don‚Äôt have a car that tramp got my shit towed and another helped me sell a car.

Rehab isn‚Äôt an option at this point bc I‚Äôve been way too many times and my folks don‚Äôt really know that I smoke rock, do xan, ice, or mdma. I don‚Äôt really want to explain the shit to them because I‚Äôd get bitched at and probably kicked to the curb immediately.
or
They‚Äôd send me to a mental ward which I‚Äôve been to many times and get sick and tired of explaining myself to everyone there over and over again constantly making me actually feel insane but I‚Äôm not I take my meds even tho they suck.

(My usually prescription is 300 mg Welbutrin XL in the morning and then 10 mg Adderall IR every 4 hours. Now I‚Äôm down to the same Welbutrin dose every morning but only 5 mg adderall IR, three times a day.)

I realized though, that I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever not been leaning on some substance as a crutch. My parents put me on adderall in third grade after my teacher recommended I go see a doctor about my hyperactive behavior. I was on adderall (vacillating between doses) from that point until sophomore year of high school when I decided to quit. But right after that I started smoking a lot of weed. I basically got stoned af every day after that for years until I got to the end of undergrad and started preparing for law school, at which point I decided to get back on adderall and eventually stopped smoking weed.

Now, I‚Äôm done with law school and I‚Äôve landed my dream job as a public defender. But it‚Äôs far less demanding than law school, leaving me with plenty of free time to enjoy life. I realized that my meds make it basically impossible to enjoy the moment instead of taking pleasure in trading it away for some future benefit. So now I‚Äôm super excited to get off of meds, not go back to pot, and just figure out who I am totally sober. I‚Äôm not even much of a drinker either so this will be truly sober me in that regard. 

My question is: since I‚Äôve never really been totally sober, without some substance clouding my mind and making me hate life or myself, what‚Äôs it like and how will I know it? Am I expecting too much? Will I be more confident? 

In particular, dating is what made me acutely realize adderall robs me of enjoying the moment. I‚Äôd be devastated when I was really into a someone and she lost interest, yet I couldn‚Äôt really explain why I was so sad other than that she was really attractive and seemed really sweet. It‚Äôs like I ignore that we have almost nothing in common. In any case, I feel like my confidence gets lost in me overthinking situations; but I‚Äôm not too sure how much is ADHD or the adderall, and if quitting meds will eventually somehow improve my love life. 

Also, bonus question, I love working out and fitness, and I‚Äôve maintained this hobby even while on adderall. Will I see a benefit to muscle growth/gains after quitting?",15,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44380978}"

Some background, I've been prescribed adderall (15mg XR) for the last 4ish years. I've been abusing it for probably 3+ years, taking a lot more than prescribed. Post-pandemic, my abuse went into overdrive, taking adderall as consistently as ever, along with occasionally mixing it with alcohol. Took 55mg today, and I thought I'd finally make a post on this forum and be transparent about my problem. 

I'm going to quit cold turkey. I know this is a psychological addiction, because I've done my most creative work sober in the past. I've been able to enjoy things I love more deeply sober. I've enjoyed reading books sober. I've been a productive person in the past sober. And I can do it again while being myself. Adderall has made me feel like I need to take it to enjoy doing anything or getting any work done. I know this isn't the truth. 

I've tried several times within the last 2+ years to quit (going cold turkey, weening myself off, replacing with other things like modafinil), but I've ended up back here. And I'm done being a robot. 

I don't have anything specific to ask, but any advice/encouragement is appreciated. I just thought if I post publicly about my addiction here, it's a step towards being more honest with myself and hopefully manifesting a successful outcome. 

I'm tired of feeling dull of emotion. Tired of feeling robotic. Tired of being so irritable. Everything adderall has made me think that I need it for I'm capable of doing on my own. And I'm done harming myself.

As people say in this sub r/Adhd think it's god's gift and will solve all of your problems, make you human again bla bla but I'm very worried about the honeymoon period ending and me being worse than when I started. 

I'm generally pretty good with drugs and understanding when a drug is good for me vs bad for me. I don't drink much and smoke weed very little. I've experienced the honeymoon effect with caffeine, in the beginning it's great but it quickly stops working and fucks with my sleep. If this was gonna happen with ADHD meds, like most people in this sub agree that it will I don't wanna take them.  

I've also been looking into it on r/Nootropics and folks there seem to say if used medicinally it can work to target areas of the brain specifically associated with focus without euphoria. That's promising. 

I sleep well and have better habits than most people but still struggle with focus and productivity.

My question is while I understand the meds have massive potential for abuse, if taken responsibly are the benefits that people say you can get from them real and long term sustainable? Not looking for a mood boost my mood is fine and I'm pretty low on the depressed/ anxious scale, I just want greater interest and focus in hobbies/ awareness of time, remembering things, talking to people type stuff.

So, for context, I am 18M about 144 pounds.

About 3 weeks ago my buddy gave me what he told me was adderall (which i later found out to be Vyvanse, the blue S489 capsules) to help me get through the early Saturday morning shift. It was about 50mg and an 30 minutes or so I took another. I felt really energetic, could not stop talking and overall felt more motivated to finish my job. He gave me more the next weekend, except this time I didn‚Äôt feel the same effects until I took 3 capsules, 150mg in total.

Fast forward to this last weekend, and he gave me a bottle of about 15 of the Vyvanse capsules. I start taking 2 every day and for the first 2 days, i feel the same original effects but on day 3 and forward it started taking more and more to feel the effects. And now, after stumbling upon it on accident, I find my father has modafinil tablets (200mg and prescribed). 

So here I am, taking close to 300mg of Vyvanse in the morning and at around 2-3 PM taking about 600-800mg of modafinil. This seems like it should be way too overkill, but I still feel about the same original feelings as when I took vyvanse for the first time (increased alertness, energy, EXTREMELY talkative, with the plus of a feeling of lightheadedness but in a good way). 

My mind wants to stop, because amphetamines are highly addictive, but my body craves the euphoric feeling I get it. What I don‚Äôt understand is how my body is able to tolerate the amount of substance I am putting into it, about 300mg Vyvanse and 600-800mg modafinil, all in the span of 4-5 hours. 

I‚Äôve done a lot of research on this sub and others that are similar, and I have seen many many posts of people describing how they felt ‚Äúwired‚Äù off of 50mg of Vyvanse and it generally feels as if people are having way more enhanced experiences than I am at exponentially lower doses.

Please if anyone has a similar experiences or has any idea why my body is so tolerant as well as any suggestions to help me quit, I would really appreciate it.

I went through State and County services they've got me placed somewhere. I am so grateful and I've been here about 2 years now.

The problem is about 6 months ago I got friendly with one of my neighbors and it ended up that was the neighbor that was holding the bag.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I was visiting her place one day and she just had it out...a bag full of white crystals and a bowl to smoke it in. Will power went out the window. 
I thought oh I can handle it now it'll help take a couple of these extra pounds that I've acquired off and it will get me motivated to do some projects that I wanted to do.

Well now it is almost a daily thing. She'll call me up and say want to come over for ""coffee"" I try and some days I actually say no it's still rare and I'd like those days to be more frequent until it's a daily ""No thanks"" from me üôèüèº

One of the things is I recognize so much of her hurt and anguish and reasons for what she's doing and I have so much compassion for her she's in a really messed up place in her head. She's  just stagnant doesn't want to change, doesn't see how it's contributing to a lot of her own health issues mentally and physically. I thought that I could be her friend and bring her out of the depths of this drug. But I'm learning that MISERY does in fact LOVE COMPANY... I'm not bringing her out she's bringing me in.

I'm on subsidized housing I can't afford to move and neither can she. So how do I maintain a cordial neighbor relationship and not get hooked up on the desire to use with her?

How can I help?,"tl;dr my partner has done meth off and on in the past. he‚Äôs made a huge effort to abstain (3 mo full-time rehab, moved back to the US, big life changes) and hasn‚Äôt been high for 45 days. i just found meth in the bathroom but he hasn‚Äôt done it yet. how can i help?


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
THE BACKGROUND

Let‚Äôs call my partner Tony. He has a history with drug addiction. Meth has been his fav drug.

Three years ago, Tony took three months off work to get sober. He saw a therapist twice a day, went through programs, and made big life changes (moved back to the US, got a dog, bought a house).

I met Tony about 9 months ago, and we‚Äôve been together for 4. Around then, he got fired from his long-time, high-paying job. This really threw him into a dark place. A couple months later, I came to learn he was getting high to cope ‚Äî and then learned it was meth.

Before talking to Tony about it, I did ~40 hours of reading to understand and have empathy: I read books, academic studies, talked to people in similar situations, and read just about every first-hand experience I could find here on reddit.

I set two rules for him: be honest with me, and get whatever help you need.

Eventually, after many conversations with him about how drugs ‚Äî and about how his actions while high ‚Äî were destroying his life and tearing our relationship apart, he made a commitment to himself to leave drugs in 2021.

In the time he‚Äôs been sober, after months of unemployment, he ‚Äúfailed upward‚Äù into a really great job that he loves.

He‚Äôs stayed sober for 45 days (which i‚Äôm *so* proud of) until now.


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
THE SITUATION

I know where he used to keep his drugs ‚Äî and compulsively, I‚Äôve been checking. Yesterday, I found his old piece and a bag of meth. He told me he threw everything away.

I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs done any yet ‚Äî I‚Äôm attuned to his behaviors while high, and we spend most of the day together.

I impulsively hid the drugs and pipe as a short-term intervention until I process how to talk to him. He‚Äôs leaving for a week-long work trip to another country in a few days (where I presume he‚Äôd be getting high, since I won‚Äôt be there to notice), so I want to talk to him today or tomorrow.

Now, my feelings: I truly think he wants to leave drugs behind. I want to support him on his journey to being sober, and I don‚Äôt want to see him get hurt (from depression, losing a job, or worse). Selfishly, I don‚Äôt want him to do it because I hate how he treats me when he‚Äôs high and in the weeks after.

My question for all of you: What‚Äôs the right way for me to tell him I care and want to support his recovery? How do I be transparent about the fact that I was snooping and found drugs? How do I know when I should get other loved ones (who supported him through rehab last time) involved? Am I naive for thinking anything I can do will help?

So as expected after my week of degeneracy, my brain does not work at the max capacity as intended, I STILL don't walk straight, I can't think to the max capacity (ballpark figure 60%-80%) and for the first few days, intense bipolar attacks.

The question is, how do I recover from this?

I've tried taking a walk, talking to people and all of that jazz, playing video games, playing my instruments. I do sincerely hope to get a job to speed up my brain but since I'm in Southeast Asia and I very OBVIOUSLY look like I was on drugs, I don't think that would happen anytime soon.

If even Psychonaut stuff like meditating helps I would completely do anything! Am planning on exercising too after my comedown (Am running a Fever also lol).

How long will I take to recover from this ailement and what are ANY WAYS to keep my mental state in order, I constantly feel like I'm about to go crazy ahahahahaha. I literally will do anything at this point (except take more drugs). So for all you Ex-Math Heads and Ex-Pill Poppers out there, teach me your ways to recover!!!

PS. Not to nag and lecture, but I really wasn't myself for that one week bender. I hurt many people I love deeply and severely regret it. I can't turn back time and if I could, I would not repeat the same actions at all.

These substances are very addictive and will destroy your mind. Not to blow my own bubble, but I was a semi gifted child and now I'm very slow and full of nonsense + depression attacks etc. I don't completely blame the drugs but now I realise the terrors such substances can cause. Every single day for a week since I stopped using I think about what I've done and feel so bad to the point of suicide.

Despite my shame and guilt in admitting I have only gotten this far by having an on and off again ‚Äúcrystal crutch‚Äù for the past 6 years. It really picked up after my best friend of over 10 years died unexpectedly drowning in a river rafting accident in June of 2016. I was not a stranger to crystal (used during the 3 months at the end of college in 2008) and always smoked or ingested, though far from a regular user. After the sudden and tragic loss of my closer to a sister than anything BFF, I struggled for years living alone in a state away from family. In 2017 my hidden drug use contributed in part to the end (only recently have I learned) emotionally abusive romantic relationship. After moving into an apartment on my own, my chosen acquaintances were less than stellar to say the least, but they served a purpose to fill the void I felt at the time. I began using daily and in 2018 checked myself with family support into an inpatient rehabilitation center. Unfortunately it did not stick which leads me to my post today. I am barely treading water trying to be a highly productive and functioning member of adult society who is about to embark on a career shift and change into one that very much frowns upon and does not accept my current lifestyle. It is also not a lifestyle habit I‚Äôd like to continue to have (dangerous choices sometimes in sexual behavior) but I don‚Äôt foresee myself 
having a serious issue quitting in some regards. . For over 6 years I lived a sober life (sans crystal) My current issue is trying to find a way to transition, hopefully somewhat seamlessly. I have previously been a prescribed adderall user which I believe led to my meeting my current friend, but now with pharmaceutical America on my side, I‚Äôm concerned. Now there are prescription giving restrictions that run rampant, my former medical history (rehab) and everything else working against me, I can no longer support my clonazepam + pristiq + adderall diet. I do still have to work 8-4 M - F until April 29 to graduate this semester. I sleep every night (though sometimes maybe only 4 hours) but don‚Äôt have a regular sleep schedule and have simply awful time management skills right now. Partially blaming COvid as I have not been gainfully employed now in almost 2 years due to employment in the educational sector restrictions. I have attended various psychiatrists, behavioral health and substance-abuse counseling, but have never found the real courage to be 100% honest about my situation whatever it was at the time. I think that this was partially due to not understanding any childhood trauma I went through (which now I have some insight into) and also my learned behavior from a narcissistic father and emotionally avoidant mother. I feel I am finally almost equipped with enough knowledge and have a foundational basis for the skills needed to be used in order to attain success. An IOP, rehab, therapy, counseling, my own reading and research on top of things learned from meditation apps, school of mindfulness, CBT, DBT, ACT and from friends in higher academia. Why then have I found my only saving grace to be smoking or ingesting a little bit of crystal enough to get me through every day. I have two PhD educated parents who have more than adequately raised me with solid fundamentals and reasonably-held morals haha. But also they set very high expectations of achievement for my sister and myself and though I‚Äôve fallen below the line of what they consider acceptable (I‚Äôve been in rehab previously and gone to jail/been arrested twice before) but they still support me on some levels. I‚Äôm currently halfway through my student teaching but I‚Äôm not sure how much longer I can live this life. I don‚Äôt want to necessarily procrastinate on bettering my life but I can‚Äôt reasonably take the risk of making too many drastic changes that would derail the freight train of my life that is almost at the ‚Äúgraduation‚Äù station of my life. What steps can I take now? Where can I start without jeopardizing what is to come within a few months? Who do I tell/involve of anyone? Looking for serious advice and kind words hopefully, though take constructive criticism well. I feel I am pretty realistic and self aware but am not sure whether to try and play the pharmacy America game or try a more natural holistic approach. thoughts welcomed.",8,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.64467186}"

Big Pharama giant Purdue made videos like this pushing Oxy AND hyped a single study that showed Oxycontin actually wasn't addictive when prescribed for ""pain"". They made billions. Doctors bought into this idea and suddenly the tide turned against being stingy with opiates and everybody said it was better to be on opiates than enduring life damaging pain - which may be true in SOME cases - but this was heavily abused to the point of absurdity. 

People who got on Oxy for even minor pain actually EXPERIENCED a big upswing in their lives (of course!)  in the short term - that is and always has been the way with addictive psychoactive drugs and very much so with cocaine and meth and plain old amphetamine. At first the anti-depressant and stimulating effects of both stims and opiates reverse things like chronic depression so many of us suffer with for so many reasons and your life actually improves as the habits and routines of a normal life continue on by their own momentum now with the wind behind your sails that only chemically pulling the strings can generate - until the house of cards collapses which takes months or even years. 

This is a stim sub and not an opiate sub but I think the possible analogy here is obvious. Stims don't kill you like an Oxy overdose - they just cause addiction and a host of life damaging effects - but since they don't kill they don't make the headlines or grab the attention of the medical community forcing them to finally realize the ""non-addictive"" trope so widely circulated was wrong. You can go on conning your doc for years . . . and you finally have to pull the plug yourself.",19,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4914793}"

I just I finished my month's worth of Vyvanse in three days.,"I guess I'm writing this to face myself, admitting to myself that I have no control over my stimulant use anymore, and haven't for a long time. I don't know how I got here. It's 6 AM, I have a class at 8:30. I just took my 4th 50 mg Vyvanse since last night. Slept for two days since Sunday morning after being up for three nights. Nobody knows about how I wildly abuse my medication, and I think that has allowed me to keep this nightmare going for as long as it has.

I'm a uni student, female, mid twenties. Right before Covid hit with its lockdowns, I was diagnosed with ADHD, and got a stimulant prescription. Before my diagnosis I had self-medicated with vigorous exercise, I was a marathon runner and hot yoga fanatic. My diet was good. My sleep was somewhat messy as I DO have ADHD, but it was historically great right before I got my hands on these fucking pills.

I noticed I was horrible at following conversations sometimes, I'd zone out frequently and sitting through a class without scrolling on my phone for 75% of the time was nearly impossible. I was still at the top 10% in my class, due to hyperfocus when needed - but felt great anxiety around big projects and essays, would procrastinate until absolutely last minute, stay up all night and pull it off. I was tired of this pattern, and no matter how I tried to exercise, meditate, organise, journal, eat clean my way around my ADHD, I felt it was time to get a diagnosis and get some help. With my BA thesis looming and friends getting diagnosed, I hopped on the wagon and was told by a psychologist I was a ""schoolbook case of high-functioning ADHD woman"".

Starting stimulants during lockdown and home-study due to lockdown was strange. My mind was calm. I felt like I had hundreds of though-loops finally finishing their ""download"". I sat alone in my room processing thoughts and feelings I never had the chance to complete.

I had more energy, I had a LOT more focus and for the first time, researching and reading became my favorite hobby. My apartment was organised and clean at all times. I was reaching out to friends a lot more, I had more social energy.

9 months in I was having a nervous breakdown during my BA thesis, my new flatmate turned out to be  a wildly misogynistic dickhead that used every opportunity to bring me down and talk down to me. Even in front of people that came over to visit. (I got rid of him shortly after). I started to isolate in my room and try to focus on my studies. I started staying up during nights taking extra pills. I'd skip a night's sleep here and there, which then became sleeping every other night. Finishing my prescription a week early. Then two weeks early. Barely remembering to eat, just Vyvanse and coffee.

I've tried quitting. I've gone a month here and there without it. Then, I start EXERCISING again and I feel great. Vyvanse kills my need for exercise. The last few months I've gotten worse and worse every month. Asking my doc to try a different med, so I often have two prescriptions at the same time since he trusts me. I never take large doses, I just want to be ""energetic and alert"", for as long as I can. While I'm high the thought of sleep disgusts me. Sometimes I try to go to sleep and if I can't fall asleep, in two hours I've said ""fuck it"" and taken a pill. Three days later (normally), I manage to convince myself to sleep because my heart hurts, it's difficult to breathe and I can't remember what I was doing 2 minutes ago.

I alternate between hypomania where I spend all my money on bullshit and rearranging my apartment for the 17th time this year, and sleeping for days when I run out. Constantly calling in sick to work, hiding away from my friends and family. Barely showing up to school, because I'm scared people can tell I haven't slept for 48 hours.

I don't know who this person is. I don¬¥t like her and I want my life back.

I don't know if I started abusing my meds because of the lockdowns and lack of routine, or as a way to avoid loneliness and emotional pain - but I admit defeat.

This fucking sucks.

I'm calling my doc and asking him to prescribe me Wellbutrin and cancelling the stimulants.

My grandpa died from Parkinson's disease and my uncle was an IV heroin/meth user, and at the end of every binge when my vision starts to blur and my gums and teeth are pulsating with pain, I wonder what will get me first. The needle or a serious disease I have in my genes.

I am scared I won't really enjoy sex anymore knowing how much better it made it. I'm scared  I'll never be fully present the way I was pre-adderall because I messed up my brain so bad. 

When I don't have Adderall I can't imagine doing regular adult life activities I feel so worthless now but 9/10 times anymore ON Adderall I can't get myself to stop fixating on smash bros or porn long enough to actually accomplish those things anymore either. I've regularly become accustomed to staying up 3 nights in a row and redosing every 6 hours or so and barely eating or drinking and it's hurt my health significantly. I only started taking extra to stay up in ""emergency"" situations just over a year ago and now I can't take it without being up at least one night and multiple pills. 

I don't know how to convince myself ill get through this and be ok. If anyone wants to talk my dms are open or ill check the comments. I'm new to this so apologies for any redundancy.",15,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7836963}"

I spent a day in the PAC (psychiatric acute care) ward, tried to kill myself a couple of times, and just couldn't stop using. My family was sick of me, and my landlord was getting ready to evict me. And on the 10th of February there I sat rig in hand doing another one. After, as I sat on that nasty, stained mattress I realized that shit just wasn't working anymore. I still felt like shit. That was it for me, I was so fucking done. I couldn't get loaded anymore, I couldn't seem to kill myself so the only thing left was to try and get sober. 

I'm still not sure how I got through those first few months and years. But somehow I did. I am so grateful for my sobriety, I've gotten to experience so much life in these 17 years that I never would have even dreamed of if I hadn't gotten clean. Some of that stuff sucked, in 2018 my daughter died of an OD. And last June my girlfriend also died of an OD. But I was able to stay sober even through that.

For reference, I am a 31F. Well, being back on adderall has unsurprisingly sucked the joy and life out of me and I just hate the person I become on adderall. I flushed the pills last night and I wrote down a list of reasons why I am quitting adderall:

1. Adderall steals my joy - a momentary, fleeting high for a lasting depressed and anxious mood
2. Makes me want to isolate socially - skip out on social events at night, don't call/text people
3. It is not sustainable - extreme highs and lows are not how we were made to live
4. I don't want to be taking adderall when I have kids someday (God-willing)
5. It messes with my hunger/appetite cues
6. Plenty of people have achieved success (in fact, the majority of people) without adderall
7. It messes up my sleep
8. I become socially awkward on adderall - mess up social cues, misread people
9. It robs me of my wonder, joy, and natural state of peace
10. It causes me to worry and create problems that don't exist
11. It makes me mean, sharp, rough, and irritable instead of light, happy, and joyful
12. Adderall steals the beauty from the moments in my life that I will never get back

I wanted to take a moment to discuss something that I think a lot of us ponder often: Should I start taking adderall again? After being clean for 4 years, I certainly thought I could.

For some background, I'm a 31 year old guy who was prescribed adderall from the ages of 20-27. For the first five or so years I took 10mg 2x a day (as prescribed) and in the final two years, my dosage was doubled and that's when I started abusing it - and when my alcoholism started to get bad. Through the help of my friends and family, I quit drinking and I quit adderall in 2018 and I haven't looked back. In that time I've gotten engaged, cleaned up my credit, my life, moved across the country and built so many positive relationships.

That said, the last four years have been great, I still struggled to focus but I had my personality back, my creativity back, I became a good person and the friend, brother, uncle I wanted to be.

Fast forward to today, I recently started a new job that I enjoy - it's intellectually stimulating, challenging and the work makes a positive difference in the world. However, I felt that I needed an edge to really prove my worth and get my focus and commitment back, so I went to see my doctor to discuss getting back on adderall. I've been able to steer clear of all drugs and alcohol so I figured I could once again try to take it as prescribed and find the benefits I thought I needed to help advance my professional life. Insert \*this is the moment he knew he fucked up\* meme.

I started taking it again two weeks ago and I'm done with it already, as of two nights ago. Hindsight is always 20/20 but I could not have imagined how much it sucked the life out of me. My personality and happy-go-lucky attitude disappeared. I can't sleep, I can't eat and it certainly hasn't made me more productive - it tricks you into thinking you're being productive. After 14 days I threw in the towel and although I'm upset I thought I'd give it another run, I'm excited to be back to myself soon.

I don't know that I did a great job of describing what I'm feeling, I'm quite scatterbrained today - but the ultimate takeaway is that it's not worth it. We're humans and we're complex, our strive for productivity and perfection isn't fair and it isn't attainable.",30,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.48542204}"

And why? Dude what does that do for me? It's more addicting than the drug itself and it's gross - what a degenerate thing to do. Sit and jack off for hours. Lord.

A few weeks ago I noticed that the effects were slowly but surely getting weaker and weaker every time I took Aderall. On top of that, I just feel like going to sleep as soon as I notice the effect wearing off. That can sometimes be at 6pm.

I‚Äôll spare you the details, but the TL;DR here is that now (7 years later) I take 6-7 30mg instant release pills a day until I run out. I go into withdrawals for approximately 4 days. I‚Äôm able to manage perceptions well enough that no one notices how tired I am.

‚ÄúIn 2000, I was a freshman at Brown University. One night, still in our first term, I‚Äôd come to complain to a friend about the situation in which I found myself: an essay due the following afternoon on a book I had yet to read. All around us, her clothes were strewn messily on her dorm room floor. ‚ÄúDo you want an Adderall?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stand them. They make me want to stay up all night doing cartwheels in the hall.‚Äù Could there be a more enticing description? From a ball of tinfoil, she pulled out a single pill, the deep bright blue of a cartoon sky. My hand shot out to receive it. I had come there merely to vent, but I left with my first Adderall ‚Äî a medication prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, a condition I knew nothing about, except for some vague awareness of classmates in high school who had needed extra time when taking their exams. At the time my friend unfurled her tinfoil ball, Adderall had been on the market roughly four years, but it was brand new to me.

An hour later, I was in the basement of the Rock, our nickname for the library, hunkered down in the Absolute Quiet Room, in a state of ecstasy. The world fell away; it was only me, locked in the passionate embrace of the book in front of me, and the thoughts I was having about it, which tumbled out of nowhere and built into what seemed a pile of riches. When dawn came to Providence, I was hunched over in the grubby lounge of my dormitory, typing my last fevered perceptions, barely aware that outside the window, the sky was turning pink. I was alone in my secret new world, and that aloneness was part of the great intoxication. I needed for nothing and no one.‚Äù",8,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.55340207}"

It did not take long for me to start abusing my prescription to get high and play video games for hours on end. I started going back to University gradually in September 2021 and did most of my semester work high off Vyvanse. However, as time went by, the vyvanse wasnt enough and each time I would take it, I would go on to do speed/meth and it was always the same story. I held off talking about it with my shrink last time I saw him out of fear of not being able to keep up with the pace of my courses and probably being dependant on it to be productive. Eventually I just got fed up of repeating the same cycle of misery that completely destroys my self worth and everything I worked so hard for. So, I took action literraly just minutes ago and called my pharmacy to explain the situation. The pharmacist was very understanding and will be removing the vyvanse from my next dispills. She also sent a note to my doctor suggesting to perhaps try Strattera or other non-psychoactive medication for my ADD.

So, in november I was working 12-16h/day.
I quickly realised that I had way too much in my plate.
I started taking eurospeed (amphetamine) to be able to have some ""me time"" after work...

I thought that I can handle it. Yeah, at the beginning I've could.
I started to take amphs more and more, as I saw the potential,- now I could do more like 100h work done in a week.

Maybe in january or something, amphs became part of my routine. It didn't give me any dopamine spikes anymore.
I decided to get some mdma and cocaine.

I can't say that I remember everything that has happened after november. I lost my health at least.

Today I woke up and decided not to use any drugs today.
I've experienced so insane pain thruout my body.
Nothing feels anything, I could just fucking die.
I got fever, chills, muscleache and so on..
No on of my friends nor my family helped me.

Like every end of past trip im passing trough the hardest part : deciding to go to sleep after 3 days of trying to get a good high with stims without being able to + crippling anxiety knowing that i'll wake up tomorrow even more depressed ... 

I'm suffering of depression + agoraphobia (no medical follow-up or meds prescribed yet)...

Most of the time after 3 days since my last awful trip i feel so depressed and empty that i decide to trip again wishing that this trip will be better (it doesnt it anymore) .... 

When im im suffering a lot of the lack of dopamine/serotonine caused by speeds trips comedown and my depression... i don't even have the energy or motivation to take a appointment with a doctor at like 3 streets of distance... 

I would know whats your tips/cue/hints/advices/supplements/foods/mineral/vitamins etc etc every things that could help me pass over speed comedown and feel better until i see a doc. 

I already have some b6+b12 and glycinate magnesium that i take evry day... i don't smoke weed cause it makes me anxious 

Well thanks you in advance
(And damnit im fighting the urge to take more stims (that would certanly just bring me a panic attack with a few dopamine dust ) instead to wait for sleep cuz the lack of dopamine right know and the feeling of emptiness is painful as fuck)
