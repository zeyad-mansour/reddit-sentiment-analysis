there's always this unexplainable euphoria, head in the cloud feeling i can't ever describe in detail. the initial explosive release of dopamine - resulting in the rush, the sped up heart rate, that seconds of blurred vision, while your hair slowly stand on end - all this after busting your first few clouds. coming from a dude always preferred downers, i was kinda okay with this.

after a few more, you're caught getting busy with 1001 things, but never anything done. you thought you're doing something productive, only to realize you've (not) been at it for hours. now that's when the birds start to chip and the sun starts to dance. ...𝒶𝒽 𝓈𝒽𝒾𝓉, 𝒽𝑒𝓇𝑒 𝓌𝑒 𝑔𝑜 𝒶𝑔𝒶𝒾𝓃

fast forward to the comedown, i'm not going to go into detail because we all know it's fucked up on all levels. it's a long exhilarating high with a very oppressive low. you're lethargic, moodless, just ready to catch up on that 3 day sleep that you missed.

now here's what i hate most about it, which let me to write this. from feeling powerful, i'm now left feeling lower than i ever been before. even after being a month clean, i felt progressively better after the first week, till recently. not sure what sparked it, but i felt much worse. i feel like i'm worthless, not only to myself, but to people around me.

my girlfriend recently got a new job in a totally different environment, which i'm proud of! my buddies kept making different plans, which i came up with something everytime to avoid coming. my mum kept scheduling random dinner out, since she somehow notices i didn't eat much. all of this, but at the same time i feel very distant for some reason. more than usual, i don't want to converse, don't even want any interaction whatsoever, want to be left alone. i just feel like i needed time alone because i felt useless. i'm typically a positive character, but ever since, i just accepted clearly that i was a piece of shit.

on it again, it might not mean much to anyone but i'm very proud of her getting hired at this new spot, after being unemployed for quite some time. but i just feel like i didn't properly showed her that. i know deep inside, i really am happy, of course i am. i love her with all my heart, and i'm proud. she'll tell me stories every night about the job and how much she actually enjoys it. it's so cute that she's excited and happy. but i really wish i could be sharing the same joy, same feeling with her. but no, at the same time i feel like i'm not capable of that, that i'm better off laying down at that dark corner spot in my room.

i'm also now becoming this much negative, hostile person. i'm very easily agitated now, and it's way easier to tick me off. i don't want my episode to affect anyone in any way. i hope she knows why i try to talk less, for now i hope. really hope she knows. from the day i decided to break my rig, i told myself i won't ever go back. i just want to be normal again.

Recently I started working as a researcher for a series of documentaries about addiction for the Dutch public broadcasting (NPO3). That's why I'm looking for people who are addicted, or who recently stopped using.

We intend to follow a few people for several months, so we can (hopefully) give viewers a deeper understanding of what addiction actually means. Why do you choose to use, again and again, even when you don't intend to? And why is it so hard to stay sober?

In the end the viewer (hopefully) gets a personal insight in the lives of several people, and their relentless drive to numb themselves. The documentaries should present an unprejudiced representation of people who are addicted. We want to show that addicts are also plain people, although their lives sometimes maybe seems to be different.With these documentaries we hope to nuance the general knowledge about addiction, and to fight stigmatization.

The coming two months we are researching. We will try to speak with as many people as we can, to get a better idea of what is happening right now. So right now I'm just curious about your stories. The first contacts will stay private.

If you want to know more about these documentaries, or when you want to contact me, you can send me a PM.",7,0

A lot of things that Adderall made so effortless to do (eg filling out paperwork or something) has been impossible.

We aren’t best friends, but we’re pretty close I’d say.

G has a 20 mg Adderall IR prescription for his ADHD. He’s had it for a few years now, and takes it every day. At first, I didn’t really pay too much mind to it, but a few things I’ve noticed/he’s told me have made me question how much he really needs his prescription.

In no particular order:

- Flunked/dropped out of all three classes he was taking last semester (not extremely advanced classes, IIRC. Intro stuff for his major.) This semester, he seems to be doing better, but he’s already missed 2 labs for biology, and he has to drop the class if he misses 3. He’s also missed psychiatrist appointments, etc.

-Occasionally snorts his addies, so they’ll hit faster and last less long

-Once snorted two-three of them them after he fell off his skateboard because he said it would numb the pain

-Extremely low amounts of sleep, especially lately. He has been acting more and more out of it, interrupting me and others more often, almost a flight of ideas in his speech, stutters more often, and speaks more slowly. Almost no ability to focus in conversation. 

-Has not slept for like two-three days at this time, told me today. He took 3-4 adderall last night (in addition to his normal dose of 1-2 earlier that day) and played guitar for 12 hours. The song he wrote was pretty good, but I mean... get some sleep dude.

-Just messaged me asking if it was a good idea to take a tab of acid after not sleeping for three days. He thankfully said he wouldn’t after I told him that was an awful idea. 


I mean, I’m sure I could name more examples, but you get the idea. My question is, if you function like this on adderall, how bad could your ADHD possibly be that you would function worse off of the medication?

His issues aren’t as bad as a lot of other people on here, but I’m worried about him still. He’s a hell of a smart dude and I would hate to see him have a psychotic break or anything else because of his recklessness.

24,2020-02-22 01:43:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/f7oxzd/the_craving_mind_and_mindfulness_a_super/,"""The Craving Mind"" and Mindfulness - A Super Effective Treatment Approach","Hi All, 

I came across a super effective model in overcoming addiction - it uses mindfulness principles and is by Judson Brewer (the book is called ""The Craving Mind""). In a nutshell, some of its principles include: 

* It explains 'automatic behvioural loops', involving triggers (feeling low on energy), behaviours (using) and rewards (feeling good, followed by feeling terrible).
* Being more mindful helps you see the damage in using
* Mindfulness teaches you to not react to thoughts (i.e. cravings). Those that have invested lots of time and energy into training the mind via mindfulness/ meditation, just accept cravings them for what they are - just a though, which doesn't need to be acted on.
* All cravings are transient - they will come and go. 

Brewer uses an acronym RAIN for dealing with cravings: 

* **R**ecognise the craving and relax into it
* **A**ccept the craving and allow it to be there. You don't need to push it away.
* **I**nvestigate bodily sensations, emotions & thoughts
* **N**ote what is happening moment to moment. 

Practicing meditation will assist in overcoming addiction. There is lots of mindfulness apps out there (Smiling Mind is a good one). If you really wanna get into meditation, go on a vipassana meditation retreat - they are usually 7-10 days long and don't cost a cent (although a donation is encouraged). 

An interesting quote from the book: ""When we scratch the wound and give into our addictions we do not allow the wound to heal. But when we instead experience the raw quality of the itch or pain of the wound and do not scratch it, we actually allow the wound to heal""

Good luck to all",13,0

I never felt “high” after the first year, I just couldn’t survive sober and get through the first weeks of withdrawals. After my first post about this on Reddit, I realized if I didn’t tell my loved ones that the hurt and suffering would never stop.


I recently told my boyfriend. He feels so validly betrayed. I feel so unworthy of everything I had in my life. He almost seemed less hurt by this than any other fight we have had, it seems he’s happy I can leave his life guilt free now. Like the 4 years we had together didn’t matter anymore. 


Him, my dogs, and my family are the only reasons I want to get sober. I don’t want to hurt or lie anymore. And I don’t know how to have the strength to get sober without him. I don’t want him to convince himself that we never loved each other because he never knew me.


It’s so true that I don’t know myself so how could he. But I know the sober and healthy me is a good and nice person, and that she’s loveable. I want to be that person and deserve love. 



SO onto recovery now though: 


I was admittedly delusional for thinking I could get sober on my own and recover from this and live happily with him, I would wean down to 1 pill a day and then something would happen, like a fight, and I’d increase again. 
I went to my doctor, and I had a hand written script that started with 


“PLEASE let me explain all of my situation because I haven’t asked for help in years and if I don’t get help now I’m scared it’ll take me years to come back.”


He essentially cut me off and told me he would send me to another doctor. He never did. I kept calling, turn out that other doctor doesn’t even accept patients. So I went to walk in counselling and it was filled with awkward silences and no help or advice. I feel so lost.


I respected posting on Reddit so much because at least you all understand what it’s like to be addicted. And I’m going to my first NA meeting tonight.


What did anyone find helped them get sober? 


NA meetings?


Detox?


Rehab?


Counselling?


Does anyone think it could ever be possible to both get sober and make amends for lying to your loved one for so long? Or is making the last 4 years of my relationship worth something out of the question?",21,0

The past 4 months quickly saw my usage go from every few months for a night maybe 2 with just a point, then to once a month, every other week, and then every weekend. 

About 2 weeks ago I bought 2.5 points, had a fun night, and then made the rest stretch through the entire week just to have some pick me ups. Ran out on payday while starting to lose my high and impulsively bought a ball. I realized my mistake when I saw how much was really in a ball of ice compared to what I usually tap out at. 

Ended up going non stop. Went 4 days no sleep constantly smoking and redosing. Even brought shit with me to work to keep the high going there. Eventually got 3 hours of sleep and figured wow Im out of it, how about just a little bit to wake me up. Nope now I'm going for another night. Came home from work last night completely drained not wanting any because I was letting myself comedown from the lunch high. Almost fell asleep but the itch for dopamine and to roll a bowl took over even though I was practically screaming no don't do it in my head. And that was last night. I was getting pretty much all side effects and went full tweaker mode. I'm good now though. 

Not much to speak of as far as psychosis type symptoms either. I stayed hydrated for the most part but overall could barely break 400 calories a day, some days just no food period so I look pretty anorexic now. I'd say there's maybe 2 points left of that ball. 

By night 3 I realized this is a big problem and this is too much damage to be doing to myself. But who cares about that when it's just so good right?  And then I had no ability to stop myself even when I really didn't want to do this anymore. I think it's safe to say I'm addicted at this point?

What should I expect once I finally get a night's rest tonight? How bad are things going to be and for how long? I work 7 days a week early so I don't have the option of a rest day, and healthy food is kinda hit or miss in my fridge.

Any help or advice would be great. I'm just so horribly dissapointed in myself. In what I just put my body through. In what I put my brain though. How I knew how damaging this could be, and seeing how badly I slowly broke all my rules for using this virus of a substance.",6,1

I've posted here before lingered for a while but today my life is at it's most precarious and I don't know what to do. 

People say to go get help, but what does that mean. 

I've used meth daily for over a year now, havn't come down since last feburary. I've got a persistant staph infection on my arms and nothing is healing. I still try to IV from time to time and each hole doesn't go away. 

I have been dealing with psychosis the entire time as well, the constant sounds of my neighbors berrating me varies on a spectrum of how real I think it all is at any moment. Of course constantly outsmarting me as it is my brain doing the tricking. 

I'm convinced they're spying on me, and I'm sure my upstairs neighbor is because she stomps around room to room wherever I go, every klink of glass or click of the torch seems to set them off. 

I also sell now to support my habit, something I'm sure they've noticed and a fact which in their minds would justify almost anything to get me out of here and thus homeless as a result. 

I have sever adhd, cripplingly so, (lost 5/5 of my last jobs for reasons that could be best summed up by reading a symptom list this was before meth too) I'm out of money but can't seem to be bothered to help myself. I could turn the boat but would rather jack off or scroll through grindr, something I apparently enjoy more than my girlfriend who means the world to me and will one day, hopefully be my wife. 

I'm at risk of losing her too. She's going to therapy and taking antidepressants, I've sucked the life out of her with my meth and sex addiction and like a trooper she's stood by me through all of it. If I make it out of this she will surely have saved my life. 

I am in a death spiral now as my two greatest triggers (the ones that set the nieghbors off or at least I think so) are meth and masterbation and I cannot do either without suffering crippling anxiety. 

My days used to be consumed with porn getting high and masterbating and now those have become the enemy only to leave me unproductive because I'm too busy minding each step as if I am under constant survailance. I hate it. I hate being scrutinized and it's tearing me to bits. 

But most of all I'm so scared of stopping. I quit heroin by myself twice. Even got real healthy. But this scares me far more than all of that, the nightmares alone are enough to keep me from ever going to sleep again, the dreams of meth appearing in godly ways only for it to evade me are fucking existentially soul crushing. 

What the fuck do I do?",10,1

I started buying and taking adderall/vyvanse in college and usually never took more than 60 mgs a day except for final exams. This worked great while in college as it felt like I had finally found then remedy for my inability to concentrate or focus on anything I didn’t really care about like my college classes and I was now actually a good student making good grades. I decided to move back home for my last year of college so I could start working and save up some money. Well, once I got back I decided that I wanted to start buying some animals for the farm because I had always raised them before college and wanted to start again. So I started to find and buy adderall or vyvanse from different local people and generally bought it in bulk because finding it was not as easy as finding it in college. I decided the best way to do this was to wake up take an addy without eating and take more as necessary throughout the day usually 100-150 mgs total. Well, you guys know how this shit goes, the days got longer and the dosages got higher until the anxiety was unbearable and I pretty much had to hide from my family on my down days.  I decided to finally quit because I hated what it had done to me in the sense that it gave me crippling anxiety/depression and made me into someone that I hate but the problem is still that even after a month being off it I had little to no energy and the only thing that helped me was a change in diet and no masturbation but this still didn’t help much and I am falling behind in school and have to finish some projects before March so I got some addy yesterday to use for this week and possibly next. I’m limiting myself to no more than 100mgs a day but with food and taking the next day off. Will this restart my whole recovery process? Also, if anyone has any remedies to regain some energy after I stop again or knows if severe back pain can have effects that worsen my anxiety I would appreciate that a lot.

The person I am speaking of is 24 years old, male, overweight. He has depression and takes a medication daily (I don't know what the name. I can only assume that is an anti-depressant) to treat his condition. However, he gets the Adderall illegally from a sibling off the street. He is also drinking heavily over the last several months. He has spoken of suicide on more than one occasion. I believe he is taking the Adderall to self medicate.

Does Adderall ""binges"" make people stay up for days? Does it make them aggressive and difficult to get along with? Example: punching drywall and yelling at younger family members? Taunting them? Cruel comments?

Does Adderall abuse make someone avoid contact with people, make inappropriate comments and/or cling desperately to one person to the point of smothering them with neediness?  i.e. you should quit your job so you can spend more time with me in my isolation.

Does it make them paranoid and withdrawn? Example:  eating dinner in the living room as opposed to eating with everyone else at the table? Obsessively checking other peoples phones and reading their messages? Do they get upset if you visit with anyone, including friends and family if it takes away attention from them?

Does it cause the addict to become psychotic? Example: They've taken up scary hobbies like collecting and sharpening weapons. Purchasing axes and files and keeping one in his car?  In the bedroom? In the living room, too?",8,0

But also always incapable of being truly life-smart, taking long term proper care of myself, always struggle with making good choices and wanting to be seen as almost inhumane due to how awesome I am lol. These weird restraints I put on myself lead to me getting married 4 years ago.

He had an Adderall Rx. Like most suburban overachievers, I had tried it before. But before I met my ex-husband, my best friend at the time went truly off the rails on the stuff and I lost one of the most important relationships in my life because she was so addicted and crazy on Adderall. Either way, didn't stop me. His 10mg BID script went from helping me finish papers time to time, to putting immense strain on our relationship if we couldn't get high. Plus he was abusive. Another suicide attempt and hospitalization followed by IOP lead to my divorce and moving home. Didn't touch the stuff for almost 2 years before finding another connection. That was last year.


I voluntarily hospitalized myself in October because I was feeling suicidal and wanted to stop it before I actually hurt myself again. Was kind of honest about how much Adderall I used, but not entirely. Since October I've graduated to getting my own script, spending a fuck ton of money on it, can do up to 700mg a day no sweat, and screwing my mood up horribly. A week ago I asked my mom to borrow money for gas and flipped when she said no. Scared the shit out of my boyfriend who was begging me to please go detox(I'd been off it for like 4 days ago this point so extremely moody, plus my menstrual cycle was starting so I was Psycho City) My mom was so shocked at how emotional over nothing I was and wanted to know if I was on drugs and I told her. I told my job. I told my best friends and some that I don't even know that well. I told everyone the truth.

Now my mom doesn't want to talk to me. I've never stolen from her, never missed work or robbed from anyone or hurt anyone besides myself, never compromised my safety or health in a dire way (besides cardiac lol), always still went to work and therapy and shit. Just spent a lot of money on fucking up my mood. I know it hurts my mom because I used money she lent me sometimes for it.... But I hardly did! And I totally didn't have to tell the truth. My sister was addicted to heroin, moved across the country and got clean alone and didn't tell any of us until almost a decade later. I'm being honest and seeking professional help and I feel like I'm being punished for it. I know I hurt my mom and it's not about her right now but she isn't perfect either.... She blamed me and punished me when I came to her about my sexual abuse!!! She is so calloused and narcissistic sometimes. It's driving me nuts. I don't relate at all to people on group who literally wake up and drink alcohol after puking all night and losing their kids. I've never put myself or others in those positions. But I feel like I'm being veiwed and treated that way and it makes me really regret telling anyone or being open about this at all. 

I also miss feeling excited. My mom recently has said wow you're doing so well! Every time she said that, every time she praised me for not getting overly emotional or worked up, I was on Adderall. Without it I'm so fucking nuts. I hate not being able to do it again and accept this is what existing feels like.

It's so easy to make pills with pill presses that look just like the real ones, and so cheap to buy meth in bulk from the Mexican cartels and sell it as Adderall for a lot more money by pressing it into pill form , there are probably many pill dealers out there doing this very same stunt , just as they have done pressing fentanyl into pills and passing them off as Oxys. 

While there has been a lot of debate and arguments regarding differences between the two chemical substances methamphetamine vs Adderall which is amphetamines , I know my truth and meth is stronger and more addictive and takes longer to bounce back from upon stopping the drug.  Thats why these criminals selling one as the other do it cuz they know it's addicting and good for business. 
It has been my experience that generics of Adderall have over time gotten weaker and weaker but I understand why - its been so abused and controversial. 
Any thorough drug screening with confirmation done using GC/MS can differentiate meth vs Adderall. 

Just remember this , if you are buying it off the streets , the dealers are robbing you and won't even get much time since they don't use and know how to run a business and can afford good attorneys that know all the loopholes in the law , and get way less time in jail/prison when they get caught than any broke ass customer who gets caught while driving or some shit one day.

the stims are poison. I've known that for a long time. I must like to forget it because I always do. it must be something fun to remember so that's why my brain keeps making me forget it. it wants me to have fun. my brain wants me to have fun. that's so thoughtful. I can't believe I ever doubted the motivations of my brain. I can't believe it's a new day today. to many cents in these words. it's not really a new day though, is it? it's the same day as yesterday. it hasn't ended so it's becoming a very long day. the day changes during sleep as far as I'm concerned. without sleep the new day does not begin. I'm not bound by the rules of time, a new day shall not be forced upon me. I am the Holy decider of days start and of days end. I decide when it's time to sleep. I am the product of an unstable consciousness. I am the voice of the lost soul. the lost soul destined to guide us forward. destined to guide us to the new day.

so fuck the stims. they suck. a lot. I also suck, partly due to the stims. mostly due to the stims? nice try but actually I sucked before the stims so no bueno. but the stimulants, they really cooked things up. cooked me up as though I was ingredients for dinner. and breakfast and lunch. cooking all day like maccas. it was my fault, I wanted to surf the wave the stims were so good at creating. I don't know how to surf so luckily the wave was of the metaphorical variety. aka the wave was not made of water therefore it is a metaphor. a fish that can't swim is just as much of a metaphor as a crab that likes clubbing. i wanted to surf the metaphorical wave of stims. so I did. i surfed like a seal in the sky. made plans to move far away to places I'd never been to live with people I'd never met. I'd find peace and quiet living my days free of metaphors. the wave always got there before me. the people celebrated the wave as if it were more than a construct of language. the people celebrate the wave and praise the glory that it's presence has invoked. I feel my mind and body shift and stretch across the boundaries they held. the wave is moving through me. all I see now is abstract imagery. I can see it sort of resembles food from a far away perspective, metaphorical food. the wave has been cooking. stims have cooked me again.",17,0

First of all: I'm not a native speaker of the English language, so my phrasing and grammar might be incorrect in some occasions -I apologize in advance for eventual inconveniences. Furthermore, I find this sub very interesting and I truly hope that the people who are suffering, are able to recover and feel less shite.

Shite, that's how I usually feel when I'm not on dextroamphetamine (Amfexa) and/or a constant 40-50 mg IR dose of Ritalin/methylphenidate.
When I'm not on any form of stimulants, I feel anxious, unmotivated, cranky, cynical and rather depressed with the world including myself. 
I stopped taking the latter all together, for like 6 months I think.
Dextroamphetamine is the good stuff for me, when I'm on it - usually a dose of 20ish mg x2-3 during the day- I feel in control. I can order my thoughts, I'm not a slave to my impulsive behaviors and I can concentrate on tasks at hand while emphatisizing with other people.

In short: I feel like a better version of myself. The thing is that I have no perscription of my own and I am planning on getting one, but should I?
I think I can get one quite easily since I have an ADHD-C diagnose.

I'm just a bit scared of getting addicted to the 'need for speed'. Family members, including my parents, have died to drug abuse and it did scare me enough not to abuse harddrugs. I have been smoking weed for years, rationalizing it as 'self-medication', but deep down I do know I'm atleast a bit addicted to it.

He now wants to take some time apart (won't admit why...only says its because of him) but somehow I have in the back of my head that it's me. It's my mood swings & the highs & lows that I get with Adderall. I don't feel like myself. I told him this when we started talking & he is abandoning me anyways. I guess I will see it as my fault because I don't really like who I am on Adderall anymore. I used to like being that super focused person who was dedicated to my work and felt my worth was so much more back when I wasn't a slave to the drug... but now it owns me. I am it's prisoner. And I have to do my time to get sober. I know this...but I just can't let go of my prescription. Someone please tell me that this makes you a different person? I don't even remember how I was like before Adderall....but I can assure you I wasn't miserable like I am now. Thought my ex could guide me in the right direction to really show me who was the real me like back then but apparently that wasn't the right decision on my part.",2,0

Advice?","TL;DR: boyfriend went to inpatient rehab and i am keeping up the house and job, and have to quit too. Advice? Success stories? Hail Marys?

My guy and I have been together since way before our meth days, and known each other since we were kids, but we have been regularly using for about two and a half years. A few breaks here and there and a lot of interpersonal chaos, shit finally just got to the point where we have to cash it in and get out. We both have addiction, obviously, but his is this progressively escalating monster of a thing like I haven't ever seen up close and personal before. He's got a long history tangled up with meth and it's no secret that he is a balls to the wall kinda dude.  Anyway, recently, he kind of crossed over, big shift of personality and manner and soforth. Kind of a real major Fuck It state. We both recognized and tried to sort it out but shit kept getting weirder and more upsettling. This week he admits that he started hitting the needle not long ago and is basically trippin and wants to get out hard and fast. So he just starts kinda freaking out and insisting that it just gets worse, like an apocalyptic storms'a coming kind of dialouge and commits himself to going inpatient (because even before the shift, his comedown psychosis was a thing of beauty, and by that I mean absolute fucking terror) and starts gearing himself up to go to detox/rehab/halfwayhouses or whatever it takes to get back to a life of sobriety, which he had done before for quite a number of years.

 Anyway.

He went in this morning.  I am weaning down off our last G and realize what ardent mental and physical work it is going to be to climb down, put fail-safes in place, create a new routine, work and all that jazz, on my own during the comedown for the next stretch. 

I would be super outstandingly greatful for any thoughts, wisdom or advice you might have to offer up. Routines or personal rules, nutrition, ways to hack your brain, sleep + self-care, relationship preservation, some way to pull in the extra bucks it will take to cover rent while he is away, what kind of exercise or duration or god, anything you can throw at me. I am broke as a joke with very few personal friends or acquaintance s in the area. I work part time at a place I love, but I am kind of a keep to myselfer, so resources and backup are limited.

I feel like I cannot get anything done without cocaine.,"I’ve been lurking for a bit and it’s helped me to know I’m not alone and I’m not the only person who’s gone through this and that recovery is possible, but from where I’m sitting I cannot imagine how I could get there.

I’ve had depression since I was a teenager (I’m 25) and since then I have just had really low energy. I was prescribed adderall a few years ago and it has helped me so much, I loved how productive and alert I could be and I didn’t have any other side effects or anything.

I’d done cocaine in social situations and I would do it a few times a month if I were going out or whatever, but things changed when I started using it while working. That instant energy boost made me feel amazing and like I could get anything done. I was so productive, just like with my adderall but times 100.

But now I’m addicted, I know I have a problem but I can’t stop. I need coke to work. I use it at least 5 days a week for working and then if I go out on the weekend, I’ll use then too. I’m destroying my nose. I’m miserable all the time. I want to stop but I also don’t want to stop because I love what I accomplish with drugs.

I know I can stop, for example I had no problem at all going a week without it when visiting family for Christmas, but that’s because I was on vacation and didn’t have any work to do. As soon as I got home, it was back to an everyday thing. I don’t know what to do. I guess I need advice on what you’ve done in my situation or maybe an idea of what’ll happen if I don’t stop?

Not all days have been easy, especially at the beginning when my addicted brain was still trying to convince me that I would never be able to achieve the same level of super-human output that I had while on adderall. Well, I’m here as proof that it is possible to still be a high-performer worthy of a promotion while being drug free. And I am 110% sure that because I chose this route, I also have been a nicer person, more approachable to people, more consistent, and have hated myself less. Less anxiety and depression from the ups and downs of that drug. No more weekends feeling “hungover” and like I got run over by a train from a 5-day adderall binge at work. No more planning my days around when I could secure 2-3 hour gaps of isolated solitude so that nobody bothered me while I was hitting the artificial euphoric high of my adderall, which was always met with an equally extreme low at the end of the day, disrupting my sleep, anxious racing thoughts all night, until I would wake up like a zombie and pop that pill to do it all over again. THERE IS A BETTER WAY! It takes persistence, and you may go back to that drug a few times before being able to quit for good. This was my 3rd attempt at quitting, and has clearly been a success and a decision I will never regret. What helped me get over the hump and successfully flush my pills down the toilet is that I realized every time I took an adderall, I was reaffirming to myself that I am not enough without it. That is fucking bullshit. Don’t believe the lies your mind tries to tell you. There is more to life than this drug, and you can find the light too.

But this time is different. We made peace over Christmas. I am 31 and I feel homesick. I feel an Imposter in my new job. But I know Dexedrine doesn't help. I know I need to process this latest phase of grief fully without Dexedrine in my system.

In trying to get my life back on track, I've returned to the 9am-5pm life on January 27. The first day I went in Dexedrine free after using 10mg-20mg daily between January 23 - January 26, but I found the training the past two weeks has been particularly intense. I've been using daily since January 28.

It has helped absorb information, but I can't deny the emotional disconnection, paranoia, narcissism, and aggression that comes from it. This time when I'm on Dexedrine, I become self aware of this organic tendency. So, I try to be mindful of the fight or flight energy. But, when I lose mindfulness, it transforms into suppression. This just leads to anxiety.

And, perhaps most importantly, I found out on January 29 that my father has had another bout of esophageal varices as a result of cirrhosis. There is grief in the body and this is a coping mechanism.

I know I will be tired, but I know that Dexedrine kills feelings. And you need different energies to truly learn and connect. This time I only have used just theurpatic doses, but the fight or flight is inevitable. I know with mindfulness, going clean won't be as hard compared to months of 60mg-80mg.

1. referred me to a psychiatrist who i already emailed about a consultation
2. introduced me to EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing), which we'll start at next week's appointment 

at this point, i would do anything not to feel the way ive been feeling since i relapsed. i'm scared, i'm surrendering. i know i'm capable of so much more and i'll do anything to be able to get to that point in my life where i'm happy & my past is behind me. i want to be able to be proud of myself, and i want my loved ones to be proud of me.

hope you're all having a lovely day. please keep moving, you're so much stronger than you think ❤️",21,0

I know that if I was on my script still I would read this and be angry. ""It helps me, this guy is an idiot"" whatever.

But isnt it pretty clear that people form a dependence fairly rapidly? Isnt it fairly evident that if you had the option to be high every day or not be high every day then you would choose being high? I don't really get it. 

I guess it's just another big pharma power play cash grab but that seems like insanity to me. 

I mean, shire used to get $30/ month from me rain or shine. 

Does anyone have any info that supports the fact that there are people out there who dose correctly/ don't have dependence etc. While on stims? 

Maybe I'm just venting. Seems fucking insane that big companies can just have you by the balls and get you addicted to this shit until the wheels fall off.

Ir gets me all fired up. Then youve got all sorts of people blaming themselves for their qualms with addiction. Stop for a second and acknowledge that addiction isnt your fault.

There are literal companies out there creating things that are so incredibly enticing and addictive whilst simultaneously creating information misleading and minimizing their side effects.

Ugh. Fuck.  Is this just in the United States? I'm irritated.",37,0

i just wrote out a list of reasons why i should NOT start taking this crap again. i wrote this for myself, but maybe it will help someone else. i should have written this all down when it was even more fresh, but oh well:

1) the big one- IT DOES NOT HELP. you are not more ""productive"" on stims. you are in fact, much less productive on stims. they may have been more helpful at one time but that was YEARS ago. they have NOT HELPED YOU in a long time.

2) you have isolated yourself from everyone you know due to stims. you have not made a new friend in over 5 years. your old friends don't count on you ""being there"" anymore. you are simply unreliable. you hide away from everyone, including your husband, as much as possible. he misses you- you can tell. you answer the phone/texts very inconsistently. you avoid interactions with others like the fucking plague. 

3) you are likely going to lose your very good job DIRECTLY due to your stims use. you haven't written much of anything in YEARS.

4)  you are not really living due to stims. you fuck around on the internet..sit around thinking anxious thoughts.. chain smoke cigs...buy stuff online impulsively...stay up for days and then sleep for days. you have one precious life and you are wasting it.

5) you aren't funny or fun to be around anymore. you've  turned into a robot who always is ""too busy"" but rarely actually accomplishes anything.

6) the other big one- you are not the mom you could be when on stims. you are too inconsistent. you not being at your best is COMPLETELY unfair to the incredible child you brought into this world 2 years ago. you will end up damaging him like you've been damaged. what the fuck is wrong with you? stop this.

7) you are not taking care of your mental and physical health on stims. stims NO LONGER help you stay skinny. you don't keep doctor's appointments while on stims.

8) you are already starting to feel better after just ONE week of no stims/taking your anti-depressant regularly...much less anxious..already laughing more..skin already looking much better. imagine how much better you'll be feeling/acting if you are clean for 1 month? 6 months? 1 year?

9) you have accomplished a lot of things in your life while not on stims..big things. even if you lose your job, you can start anew and do good things once again. 

10) stims have taken your confidence, personality, and zest for life. you fucking KNOW this to be true. you know there is better out there for you because you've had so much better. do it for yourself and your family. you won't ever have the life you want for yourself or your family if you are on stims. it is not possible. stop lying to yourself. enough is enough.",180,0

My body feels better today than it has the last few days, and the exhaustion seems to be getting more tolerable. I don’t feel as irritated as day 2 for sure. 

I don’t have plans to never use again, but due to pre existing medical conditions and tolerance I knew that a break was 100% necessary.

I attributed it to all kinds of stuff but eventually just accepted this is apparently how I dream for the rest of my life now.

The past 3 weeks were a very unexpected breath of fresh air with almost no nightmares and just old fashioned adventures romps like dreams ought to be. I've been racking my brain with why now, and I only just now realized that the time line lines up exactly with when my use went from recreational use to *ab*use, and got worse as my abuse got worse. And now that I've gotten it back to purely recreational - as in a strict 'maximum of one Saturday evening (18.00-00.00) once every 2 weeks' which I haven't strayed from since the New Year, and have thus been sober for 14 days in a row multiple times, which hasn't happened in a long long time - suddenly my dreams are not anxiety wracked panic dreams anymore. 

This cannot be a coincidence, right? God, if using amphetamines seriously turns out to be the cause of my nightmares, I don't know if I'll ever willingly touch the stuff again, even recreationally. This is such a burden that's lifted from my shoulders. My mood and especially motivation have just been super high. I don't dread going to sleep at night anymore. I just wish I'd made the connection earlier and quit earlier, but alas, we're here now.",7,0

I was 3 months sober from Adderall, Xanax, Gambling and One other bad vice that I won't mention on here. The adderall was always the spark that set the fire with the others.. anyway rewind to Thursday night when I am approaching my 3 months. I was playing a video game with some guys and one of em who lived by me mentioned his roommate having a ton of adderall.   


I'm not sure why I asked but I asked if I could buy some.. he said sure come over. 

Immediately I felt my blood pressure rise, I was salivating and already having anxiety but I went and picked up some. Without even thinking I shot one back and began driving home. 

This is where it gets bad as I ended up losing $1,000 gambling online, and spending another $2,000 in another vice I had been abstinent from, taking a xanax to crash and I have been living in a world of hurt ever since. 

Not only did I disappoint myself but now I am fucked financially, I've let down my gf/family, and all im left with is heartbreak and depression. 

I haven't had a craving or used anything since that day but in 10 hour I managed to unravel all the progress I made in 3 months and now I am back to ground zero and it fucking hurts so bad. All I want to do is be alone and just feel sorry for myself. Fucking sucks so fucking bad :(",13,0

But it’s never enough.

I’ll end up with a few, maybe 5, 6, 7 bags to sell at the end of the weekend. And i’ll say to myself, “One bump off the top won’t hurt, nobody will notice” And suddenly, it’s monday morning, 7:00am. Time for school. No bags left. Me, another 5/600 further into the hole. I need help.",2,0

friday night i traveled 2 hours to meet up with my boyfriend & some friends. i knew i was going to have the opportunity to use, i knew it would be better if i didn't, but i went into the situation pretty much knowing i was going to use again. ended up doing 3 shots within the span of 12 hours.

talk about fucking my brain up. now it's sunday afternoon, for the past 12 hours i've been so fucking sad. my heart feels heavy, that feeling you get when you get dumped and you feel like there's so much pressure and weight on your chest, and nothing you can do will make it go away except give it time.

it doesn't help that my boyfriend & i live two hours apart, and the last time i saw him was december 22nd, then again on friday. now im back in my city, two hours away again, and i miss him terribly. i feel lonely & isolated & most of all im fighting back tears and i dont even know why. 

**so to top it all off:** the disgust i have in myself for relapsing, the loneliness and isolation i feel in this city, my yearning for my boyfriend whom i dont know when i'll see again, and this super intense dopamine crash.... this is all too much for my fragile brain to handle lol. i'm literally crying

Yes I have abused my prescription, but as of late I seem to be successful at taking just 1 Vyvanse pill per day, as prescribed. However, I don’t even want to take ANY of it if my ADHD is just a sham and I don’t really need it. 

I know the obvious answer is to get professionally tested, and I want to, but I’m afraid to be completely honest with these guys. I feel like there are too many ramifications with coming out as a potential addict, especially since my case is relatively mild and manageable (which I am very grateful for). 

I would really appreciate any advice. Thank you.",7,0
