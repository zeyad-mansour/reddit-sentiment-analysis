I am in my early 30s and I am still living at my moms and it’s impossible to quit. I quit and then I’m so fucking bored that being this bored seems worse than just taking a damn drug.

I don’t even like who I am when I’m on it but I like that I can get shit done. I’m stuck in this depression of just watching Netflix and doing nothing. I don’t know if I could ever give this drug up or what the fuck I should do to try to give it up. This is the longest I have gone in so long and this is the first post I have ever made. Please help.

i never felt fragile as I do now, smoking pipes 7 days a week. It is exacerbating every aspect of the ""bad"" in me.
 I've been smoking weed for many years, same for alcohol (i dont feel an addiction as I never drink alone and actually only drink ""socially"", it never crossed my mind to drink other than to share some fun time with friends + dad was an alcoolic and died of it). Used mdma / pills for about 2/3 years at least 3 binges a week due to the partying (I now only do like twice a year for NYE and a birthday, i enjoy it like lsd and ketamine, on special occasions, can be 1 every two year i dont think about it).

But then my life changed as i moved around the globe and i discovered ice, and started smoking more and more to keep up with the 100h work week + partying every day. The last 7/8 months (just before covid), i was smoking before work, at work to keep on my toes, then during the party, almost no sleep and again we go.

Covid hit and i had to move back, no more job, no more anything, i stopped from day one as i had no other choice (no plug, parents house, and no more money). It actually was okay for the 2.5 months in quarantine, but when i got a job straight after, same pattern emmerged and moved out + found supplies. I spent only a week in the last 6 months without smoking as i had none, and had vivid nightmares, energy low, and no more job as i'm working hospitality and we had to stay at home.

I dont know how to get out of that pattern, job is starting finally again and i need to be quick as fck, but the time using is starting to add to much mental pressure on top of ptsd, depression, and probably adhd (not diagnosed but strongly suspected). If i quit, will I be able to perform, and look at least focused? 

Also, i smoked almost no weed since ive been hitting the pipe again, so would it be okay to smoke or would it make things worse? I genuinely enjoy weed (the taste, the smell) but I have no knowledge of the effects on the dopamine and all other withdrawals caused by stopping the ice and would gladly appreciate some tips.


I'm trully sorry for the long post but nobody in my life has ever been aware of the ice (the only 2 did not know that it was everyday), and I needed to get that off my chest, but on a self high five note, I've reached out to medical help for finally trying to work on the ptsd and depression (diagnosed at 11/12 years old but needed to grow in order recognize i cant beat that shit alone, and lying is not the perfect long term plan apparently).

Wishing all the best to you all, wherever you may be right now.

P-S: Would it be reasonable to use recreational low dose of shrooms / acid to share an afternoon with friends and not feel dead inside as i feel 24/7 now? (I'm talking a one time use in early stages of quitting meth).

Hi! At the moment I'm on the 268th day since I quit. I wanted to share my story. (because I felt really anxious tonight)

So, here it is.

I finished graphic designer school with A in 2018 November and I applied a job in a local T-shirt printing store. It was small, it was cool and everything. Back in 2017 I already tried cocaine and speed 3-4 times, but I hated the group everyone was depressive and I was like ""nah, that's not for me thanks"" and I didn't do it for a year, I didn't even drink that time.

So back to the Tee printing store. I really liked the atmosphere. My 2-3 colleague was very friendy and outgoing. I felt like hell yeah a cool job and workplace with a good atmosphere. After 2-3 week, we did some overtime with my colleague and then he took out a tray from the table's drawer. He just asked ""do you want some speed?"" I rejected the offer. I rejected it so many times. Maybe after a month when  I went to work on a festival I got 1g from him. I shared it with my mates who work on the festival etc. etc. and I started to use more frequently after that.

I convinced myself that what we do are not ""that"" bad, we work hard every day so a little here and a little there won't cause any harm. Meanwhile one of my colleague's friend (who was a dealer) got home in January and he brought cocaine, it was't doing much for me I just felt a little more focused and maybe more hyped but that's all, nothing extreme like in the Wolf of the Wall Street. He started to come to the store more frequently give us free coke and having fun. In 2019 februar we almost did 1-2 line every day or every other day. 

I was doing fine until 2019 august/september. Where I did a little more speed or it was stronger I don't really know, but I only slept for 2-3 hours and on the next day I did a little speed too just to stay awake, of course, I slept 2-3 hours again. After that I was like fuck this shit I won't do this shit again aaand I didn't do it just once in a party after that. 

In November I had a 1day festival job we brought 1g cocaine with my friend, we used it but something wasn't alright. I got a strange feeling in my testicle and that scared the shit out of me. I told my friends that I got this problem and they said the stuff can't do anything like that. Yeah sure, I was stupid enough and they convinced me but I was more cautious, I was on and off with 2-3 week breaks.

New Years Eve, I promised myself that I won't do anything again, I got 3 weeks and I felt totally fine but again friend came in got some free stuff and I was like why not I did 1-2 line, after our friend who always gave free cocaine for us couldn't bring more my boss and our oldest colleague got a dealer who gave us coke but it wasn't like what the previous one was it was stronger it was cutted up with some ""shit"". I rarely snorted anything from that point but after two weeks I always gave in because they were calling me ""hey you want one?""

I was still good but I got 0.4g for free. I was like ""okay I will sell it or drop it to the bin who the fck cares"" and I did that 0.4g in 3 days (I mean that's not much) but my testicle started to hurt again. This time I realized this is not a fcking joke, this shit causes everything and this was on 4th of july. I started self loathing like ""why I was so stupid that it won't cause anything bad"". I got stressed about the balls but in 2-3 weeks it eventually went away. I had a car accident (no one got hurt) stressed the shit out of me for 2 day and I hooked up with my ex girlfriend just to have sex did it without protection and after the sex we started to talk about what happened to her while she moved to the capital and she was like "" a guy raped me"".

It scared the shit out of me. I was sure that I got some STD, after two week I was sure I got HIV. I had diarrhea for 1 week, dry eyes, sudden back pain, brain zaps. Thanks for God every test came back negative after 2-3 month but I started to get worse, losing my concentration/focus, short term memory got worse, attention span was bad aswell. I was so scared about these thing I couldn't work properly after 2020 october I had good and bad days and fuck worst days of my fckin life.

In December I quit my job because my cognitive and mental state started to became worse. I couldn't undestand the most simple e-mail. There was a time when I picked up the phone and I couldn't understand what the lady was speaking (it was clear and loud and simple). When I quit my boss yelled at me for 10 minutes, he said I'm a fucking insincere motherfucker who was lying all the time and he was so kind to me all the time, he was an agressive shit and a chronic liar (everyone knew that in work)

After that in the first 3 weeks I literally just slept for 12-13 hours. In the last 2 month I started to see some improvements in my energy levels daytime. I started to play games more so my basic mood is better than what it was. So yeah it’s good, but my cognitive skills, understanding, muscle tension, speaking skills, shor term memory don’t really improve or I can’t notice it because the healing is so slow. Sometimes it feels like my brain space out for a while. I got worse in everything, in art, in games. It feels like I’m 14 years old mentally with a lot of insecurities and it feels like I’m 50 years old physically. I had a good physique before this and everything was interesting and I my memory was superduper good and it feels like I’m just a shell of what I was before 1.5 year addiction/abuse.

TL;DR: I fucked up my 2019 and half of the 2020 I quit for good but sometimes I really worried about my cognitive skills and mental clarity. I don’t have carving or any desire to use anything I even quit coffee. I’m totally fine without them, I mean I don’t carve them or anything but I just miss my old self who was productive, who could multitask, who understood everything, who was good in everything. I just feel myself so fucked up. I always hope, I won’t wake up tomorrow or to be precise won’t wake up like this tomorrow. I was never like this. I always loved days, waking up early, loved to do anything. I liked to be alone and I liked to socalize and I fucked up everything  in my life with 1.5 year, it’s just seems so unfair. I didn’t drink heavily or did more stuff than others and it seems like I’m the only one who got fucked up like this. I never stole from anybody, I was always a really responsible person. It feels like everything I had left me. It feels like I’m retarded. It feels like I’m dead.

Thanks for your time if you read the whole wordsea what I vomitted from the deepest part of my soul. It means a lot to me. 

P.S.: Oh yeah and I forgot to tell about the little neck muscle twitch what I have since august.

P.S.2: oh and sorry if the grammar or anything else is bad. My english skills got worse aswell and it’s not my first language.",7,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4507487}"

Hi everyone! My parents both have CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome) and I myself am not the most energetic person there is although I'm only 23 years old. I was diagnosed with ADHD in November 2019 and precribed 70 mg of Vyvanse which half a year later was upped to 120 mg a day (1x70 mg + 1x50 mg). This drug truly benefitted my life until the dosage gradually went up to the point that I was abusing the shit out of it. Later on I got on Clonazepam (benzos) in addiction and also started abusing that. Those two drugs defined my life. I would always carry the bottles of pills with me wherever I went and I found it somewhat cool to be addicted to speed and benzos. It was the ""limitless pill"" combo I'd been looking for my whole life. I was full of energy, productivity through the roof, creative inspiration and confidence in abundance, pure bliss. But then my life started gradually falling apart. I would still eat but I seriously lacked sleep. I got into a pattern of binging on stimulants for 40-50 hours and sleeping for 18 hours. Then repeat. I loved it. The drawbacks seemed insignificant to me. But the were quite serious. Heart palpitations. Resting heartbeat always in the 120 BPM range. I lost myself but I always felt as if I was the best possible version of myself there was.

Now, I'm almost eight weeks clean from Vyvanse and I think about it. Every. Single. Day. I dream it at night. Sometimes I'll get high in my dreams which feels somewhat comforting, but then I wake up and remember I don't have access to Vyvanse anymore and yet another day of zero productivity is ahead of me. When will it get better? I keeps reminding myself that I probably don't have ADHD or CFS and I just have to give it time. But on the inside I feel as if I'm throwing my life down the drain by not being on stimulants. I looooveee productivity. It is the one single thing that brings me the most fulfillment in life. Without productivity I feel like a looser. Almost as if life is just over already at 23. The funny thing about me is that I was never a usual addict. I never drink booze. I don't smoke bud. Although I have tried both numerous times. I've never tried ecstacy or oxy and I'm not at all interested in partying or getting fucked up. I merely used (that is abused) Vyvanse in order to focus on work and furthering my already successful career in the creative field. Now I watch my career slowly but steadily deteriorate as I detox from the love of my life – amphetamine.

Every day, I play with the thought that just perhaps I might be able to start again someday and maybe do it right this time around. I.e. only take my prescribed daily dose and reap the benefits thereof. And also ditch the benzos in order to prevent myself from upping my Vyvanse dose. But can I do it? Isn't that akin to a hopeless alcoholic saying they can just drink three beers a day no problem? I know that the urge to redose Vyvanse is to great that I cannot resist it. Yesterday though, I watch an interview with a notible psychiatrist who recommended that people with ADHD resort to a steady mini-dosing protocol to maximize the effects of the medication. In my case that would mean taking 4x30 mg spread throughout the day as opposed to taking the 120 mg all at once or 70 mg upon awakening and then adding 50 mg three hours later. That sounded like a great idea. But unfortunately I don't think I can do it. When the initial ""high"" fades away, I miss it all too much. I'm an addict. But I miss Vyvanse every day and dream it every night. God only knows if my life will get better – sober or not.",9,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.67676216}"

 I've become a daily meth user. I've been using daily for right around a month. It's already affecting my life. I do not want it to go any further, I can't believe I allowed it to go here. It's probably a very similar story to any of yours so I will spare the details but long story short I messed up. I know the longer it goes the worse it is going to be and that if I don't stop now it will be even harder. I am using it to have the energy to keep doing the things I need to do even though, well you know how it turns out. I think I am having a moment of clarity. I have a hard time admitting what I am doing even though I know it will help set me free from this. I will tell my SATP person what's been going on although she probably already knows. Anyhow I don't have much experience with this so I am asking what am I looking at after using meth for a month straight? I've done it every way known during that time except oral ingestion and nasal insufflation, I went from smoking, to booty bump, to IV use on these past few days. I have been eating and hydrating pretty well but sleep has been hit or miss. I don't have a way of knowing how much I've used daily but my tolerance has skyrocketed. I imagine a half gram to a gram a day probably. I don't think the quality is that good or it could be my tolerance or my chemicals I don't have anymore, I honestly don't know at this point. I am a veteran and I have resources to get help, I just need to use them. Although doing things with the VA seems to be a problem all its own. All the more reason not to add to my own problems I guess, I have enough already. If anyone could share what it was like stopping after a month use I would greatly appreciate it. Also what helped during that time. I have things I have to do tomorrow so I plan for that to be my last time. I've said that several times over these past few weeks though and I'm scared.

Hi everyone,

I am Melvin Goh, a PhD student from the University of Wollongong, Australia. My PhD research focuses on improving the health and well-being of people impacted by alcohol and other drugs via health risk communication.

I am conducting a study to survey people living in Australia and the United States of America (USA) about their alcohol and other drug use, health and well-being, health behaviours, and the impact of COVID-19 (UOW Ethics Approval No. 2019/183).

**What’s involved?**

You are invited to complete an anonymous online survey about your use of a range of substances, health and well-being, health behaviours, and COVID-19. The survey may take up to 20 minutes, although some people may complete it faster. Please be assured that your responses will be kept strictly ANONYMOUS as the survey does not ask of any personal identifiable details from you!

**To be eligible to participate, you will need to:**

* Be aged 18 and above living in Australia or the USA;
* Have had problems with illicit drugs or alcohol and/or have attended alcohol or other drugs (AOD) treatment in the past 12 months.

Please visit [https://uow.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_dm1oXM1GmqDEJQV](https://uow.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_dm1oXM1GmqDEJQV) to participate or to get more information on the survey.

Eligible participants who complete the entire survey can enter a prize draw to win one of five $50 Amazon gift cards (currency based on location). I understand that a lucky draw for a gift card isn't the most attractive incentive, but I hope you can understand that it is the most I can get as a student. More importantly, it will help me with the PhD and achieve my aim of improving the health and well-being of people impacted by alcohol and/or other drugs.

If you have any questions, please let me know. Thank you to everyone who took the time to read my post and complete my survey :)",2,{'covid': 2},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.72289455}"

2021-03-15 07:38:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/m5is0y/recovery_timeline_recap/,Recovery Timeline Recap,"About a month ago (25 days ago to be exact), I posted in r/StopSpeeding for the first time. I had gone on my longest and most emotionally deteriorating binge thus far. 33 days of daily use, undernourishment, and sleep deprivation. I was experiencing just unbearable physical, mental, and emotional side effects. Auditory and visual hallucinations, formication, full body pain, paranoia. After a month of pushing my body and mind to the limit, I finally gave up. I wasn’t getting the high anymore that I so desperately craved. I was just destroying myself at this point. I was picking at my skin, I was down nearly 20lbs, my face looked sunken in, and I couldn’t trust my brain anymore. So I stopped smoking dope.

I made it a full 11 days before relapsing. The worst part of relapse for me is the fact that my decision is a conscious one. I know I shouldn’t go and buy dope, but I don’t stop myself. I waited nights to buy a bag. I made sure to hold onto my money for 3 days so I could buy dope. February 28th, I bought a ball from a plug I'd never used before and got ripped off. Rookie fucking mistake. Salt mixed up with ice, no cool man. Copped a new baggie and I was out of dope 3 days later. Fuck, I dont want to be sober. 

My roommate was selling me 2mg xanax bars for $2.50 a pop. I spent my only $8 on 3 bars. Anything to disconnect from reality for a while. I did Xanax 3 days in a row, putting myself and my partner through emotional distress, including multiple suicide attempts and breakups. Fuck Xanax, I hate what it’s doing to me. I'm done with this shit. This was March 7th. 

After 3 whopping days of sobriety, I decide to buy 4 more bars of Xanax after receiving $10 cash for doing a favor for a friend. I was having a hard time sleeping and talked myself into buying Xanax to put me out and of course bought way more than I would’ve needed for that purpose. Stupid fucking addicted brain. I did those Xanax for 2 days. On the second day, I was sexually taken advantage of by my roommate. Raped while too barred out to resist. How fucking pathetic and it RUINED ME. I didn't touch Xanax after this. I still had a whole bar left and I didn’t do it and threw it out. 

After waking up from the Xanax haze and realizing what I had let happen, I was so ashamed of myself. I couldn’t look my partner in the eyes and I felt so empty and so unsafe in my home, our home. I picked up my best friend and had her stay with me all day so I didn’t spend my money on dope and I wasn’t home alone again with my roommate/abuser. We got super stoned and hung out at my apartment all day long. We hung out in the living room because my bedroom was a disaster. Every time my roommate left his room, he kept flirting with us and hinting at us hooking up with him. He would stand and stare at us, giving us awkward eye contact,  I felt very uncomfortable in my house and this persisted throughout the evening, and got even worse when it was my roommate and HIS FRIEND trying to fuck my friend and I. 

Later that night, my friend and I had talked ourselves into dropping acid together. We both figured it would be fun and it’d keep my money from being spent on meth or anything worse. My partner passed out on my friend and I, and had his nephew stay the night to “trip sit” us. THIS SUCKED. Midway through my trip, I begin to notice I’m having some soreness in my throat and begin to connect a few pieces in my brain. I can’t say anything about it out loud, not while my partner's nephew is listening at least. I am going insane inside my brain. What if my sore throat is STD related? He didn’t wear a condom and I never took a Plan B. Oh my god, my partner is going to find out. AT this point, I began to spiral. The entire trip, I am fearful of my roommate and highly paranoid. I ask him to leave quietly for the night with his guest, after LOW-KEY freaking out on him for giving me an STD. 

This alleviated SO MUCH OF MY ANXIETY AND STRESS. I would finally feel safe in my house again. I opened up to my family and my partner about the abuse I suffered at the hands of my roommate. I opened up about my recent drug use. I opened up about needing help and being ready to get sober and start my life over.

Anyway, I was wondering if anyone with ADHD went on prescription stimulants after quitting meth and if it helped. 

I’m on wellbutrin and it has been helpful with withdrawal but not with ADHD. I haven’t been on Adderall since I changed to another psychiatrist who I can work and communicate with. We have already discussed about possibly going on another stimulant med (since adderall xr just made me tired) 

I know amphetamines did improve my quality of life before I started abusing them, but is wise to go on prescription stimulants after heavy meth use? I don’t really have a problem with pills, just with amphetamines in a smokable and water-soluble form. 

Another thing I’m not sure about is if normally prescribed dosages would have any benefit. I have a pretty high tolerance and also seem to metabolize it really fast. But I’m going to be discuss about it with my psych in a week.

One thing i’m sure of is that I not going to return to my old habits regardless of what happens. I feel pretty good right now considering that I binged 10.5 grams in a month before I decided to quit. Maybe I won’t need stims, considering that it could take 1-2 years for my brain to heal and that I’m only under 2 weeks sober.

2021-03-14 21:14:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/m5999g/who_else_is_sick_of_everyone_including_doctors/,"Who else is sick of everyone, including doctors, downplaying or even denying the existence of adderall addiction/withdrawal?","TL; DR: doctors and big pharma, especially in the US, invalidate or ignore the seriousness of adderall and it’s addictive potential/withdrawal effects; it’s very delegitimizing to people like us who struggle and the lack of resources for rx amphetamine addicts is unacceptable; the lack of recognition is even worse. We need to make it known how serious this drug is. We need to make a change already. We can do it eventually with enough voices being heard together. They can’t get away with this forever.

Seriously. It’s driving me crazy. This is a huge contributor to the fear, guilt and shame most of us have when it comes to quitting. Because we’re told that it shouldn’t be so hard, and that there’s something wrong with US, not the drug itself.

I cannot fathom how or why a majority of doctors are so uneducated on adderall’s effects particularly the withdrawals. Not to mention many other medications, but particularly adderall. When will the FDA actually take notice of the serious issues people are experiencing from these drugs? They’re just as addictive if not more addictive than opiates, benzos, etc., and yet the scripts are given out like candy. Have we learned nothing from opiates? I guess just because something doesn’t KILL people, then it’s not worth taking a closer look at. Regardless of whether it’s causing massive amounts of addiction and is essentially legalized speed.

The whole thing just makes me sick. Makes me feel like we are animals and they’ve been using us as lab rats, then denying anything is wrong. They don’t know the long-term implications of these drugs, but they won’t admit the seriousness of an addiction to them. Any doctor who says that adderall withdrawal doesn’t exist should lose their license. Or go work for big Pharma.

How dare they. How dare they invalidate our experiences. How dare they put us in this position. How dare they leave us with no other option but to suffer as a result of their carelessness. And how dare our society for ignoring it for so long that people are made to believe it’s okay. It’s not. And it never has been.

Adderall and other amphetamines are highly addictive and can destroy lives. And they do. A majority of college students abuse it, and the prescribing rate has gone up 300% in 10 years. And sadly most people who become addicted to adderall end up this way because they want to do well and succeed in life, because our capitalistic economy is fucked and we put success and work before anything else. What’s a little drug to help me take a test? Then before you know it, you’re taking it every day to function. Other people are handed the drug like candy, at school or work or wherever because it’s so commonplace. Others were stuck on it since they were kids. In some way or another, I think every single person I know has taken adderall, or had it offered to them, has a child who takes it, a sister/brother/mother that are prescribed it. 

So many people are suffering in silence, stuck in a depression where they are ignored by doctors and ostracized by their family or peers because there is such a lack of knowledge about how seriously these drugs affect people. Multiply the number of people on this forum by millions and you’ll get the true number of people who are out there struggling.

But I don’t see anything done about it, and I’m sick of it. I’m tired of seeing adderall spoken about and written about so casually. It’s all due to its lack of perception as a serious drug. It’s become so normalized it makes me sick. Then addicts like us are looked down upon for having problems with it, when Betty or Suzie takes it once for a final and brags about it to the whole school while people in the same room are quietly suffering from an actual addiction to the medication. 

People like us deserve more resource and legitimate medical recognition of the syndrome we experience—the withdrawal, the depression, the struggle to feel normal and not relapse. For fucks sake this forum is filled with people looking for answers because they have no where else to go. This shouldn’t just be a Reddit forum, this should be a national issue that gets recognized, researched, funded, and regulated. The same thing happened with stimulants in the 80’s and here we are again. The government found a way to sneak back in and make money, as usual. By selling amphetamines as legitimate prescriptions and giving it to anyone and everyone of all different ages like it’s Advil. Even Advil causes serious heart problems. They just “found out” a few years ago. Sounds familiar doesn’t it? Right now it just seems like we’re being forced to suffer in silence because addiction to this drug is minimized and the use of it is so normalized. Many people don’t even realize they’re addicted until it’s too late. Sometimes I can’t believe we give this shit to 8 year old children. The racket is real. 

I just want to feel recognized and heard. I want to feel like my struggle is real instead of having to internalIze it every day and suffer in silence. Because no one around me understands, and even if they do, they won’t talk about it either. When I turn to medical professionals, I get the same shit. It’s almost like they’re shocked when I tell them what’s going on. They treat me different after anyway. Like something is wrong with me for taking more of a drug that they acknowledge makes people want to take more to achieve the same effects. You acknowledge the addictiveness of the drug but don’t provide any information beyond that for people trying to stop. Then you poo-poo their concerns, and see them as failures when they struggle to stop or recover. Fuck them. Fuck this society for being so fucking shallow and blind. Nothing will be done about this until it’s too late. There’s too much money in it, and we all know that. But people &amp;lt; money. And we all know that too.

We need change. It’s long overdue. The world cannot keep ignoring the fact that rx amphetamines have become a major racket for doctors and big pharma who downplay the seriousness of the drug to make money. 90% of people can walk into an office and get an rx for this. And many will eventually become addicted and have to suffer for the rest of their lives, or at least until they make changes to stop, with extreme lack of regulation. 

Addiction to adderall and other rx amphetamines is just as serious as any other addiction. It’s they’re over prescribed on a massive scale. Yet they’re looked at differently than other drugs in the same class. Amphetamines are the only drug they don’t have any withdrawal medications or protocols for. Nothing. There’s no specific focus on adderall whatsoever. Yet it’s the most rampant addiction in America today. And somehow it’s been flying under the radar for almost a decade. 

I’m tired of it. And I’m going to do something about it. Any ideas for how we could make a change would be appreciated. If you are in agreement with what I’ve said here. And please, for anyone who dislikes or disagrees with all or part of this, I respect that. This post is just me expressing the way I feel and seeing if anyone else feels the same way. It’s not meant to offend. So please don’t pick apart every word or get nasty in the comments. I’m really just looking for a place to feel heard and meet people who are interested in making a change when it comes to the way amphetamine addiction and amphetamines themselves are viewed/dealt with in this country.

As far as what I meant about ideas for raising awareness, in my head I was thinking of an ad similar to the smoking ones but with someone taking an addy and their heart rate increasing and them doing work for hours then crashing the next day, failing classes or not eating enough, getting sick or spending too much time sleeping, isolating or being aggressive, depressed, etc. Probably couldn’t do that for some sort of legal reason, but that’s what I was thinking kind of. Or even some sort of a petition. Or a letter to the FDA. Even if it does nothing I’ll still feel like I tried. I want to help the next generation. I don’t want them to suffer the way we have.

I’m a 22 y/o male student, I got 3 months left on my semester and then I’m hopefully gonna go to college but that depends on how my grades turn out. I make music on my free time and my dream is to have a career as an artist, it’s the only thing that I wanna do so I have to make it lol. 

I’m 6’3/190cm and weigh around 198lbs/90kg.
Aaaand I *think* I’m addicted to Dexedrine/Dexamphetamine Sulfate.
My plan is to take a month off to reduce my tolerance back to zero and after many failed attempts I hope this will be the successful one.

————————————————————————————

**-My Story-**

I’m diagnosed with: ADHD/ADD *(not sure which one, might be both actually)*. Depression, Anxiety, Insomnia, Social anxiety and PTSD... I think that’s everything lol.

Well.. My doctor prescribed me Dexamphetamine Sulfate 5mg IR for my ADHD/ADD and I’m prescribed to take a total of 9 pills a day **(45mg)** 3 in the AM, 3 at lunch and 3 in the PM.
I really loved it! I could finally focus. I was motivated, productive, i could read which is something I really hate doing, it helped a lot with my social anxiety and depression and - it helped me lose weight.
I’ve lost about 66lbs/30kg in like 1 and a half years, I went from 264lbs/120kg to 198lbs/90kg - and it felt AMAZING cause my body has always been one of my biggest insecurities and my goal is to get down to 176lbs/80kg.

**Anyways,** I uhm... well.. 45mg was only effective for so long and I started taking more and more and more. Right now I take about **20** pills a day **(100mg)**, some days I will take **120mg** a day and even that’s not giving me the desired effect I want anymore. I both love and hate these pills.. I hate that I love them so much and even tho it’s barely effecting be anymore I still take that amount every day. 
Well, the only effect I get now is:

**-Migraine almost daily (usually on the right side**

**-My heart feels weird, like it’s really tired but at the same time energetic (hard to explain)**

**-Feeling sick/nauseous, like I’m gonna vomit**

**-Fatigue**

**-Paranoia from time to time**

**-Being really jumpy, and easily startled**

**-And guess what? The comedowns came back and they are awful**

**-Feeling like nothing is real and I’m not real** *(delusion or depersonalization???)*

**And oh,** the hallucinations... Seeing something moving/running in the corner of my eye, flashing lights, lightning streaks etc. 
It gets worse at night, last night I thought something/someone was climbing onto my bed and I not only did I think I saw it, I had *the feeling that* something was climbing onto the bed. 

**Could these be signs of a psychosis or something?**

ALL THIS AND I STILL. TAKE. THAT. AMOUNT. OF. PILLS...

*before you ask.. yes I drink enough water and yes I force myself to eat something during the day*

Lately I’ve noticed something weird... Some days I just **can’t** take many pills - no matter how much want to. It’s almost like my body is *’shutting down’* to keep me from taking more and what do I do? I lay in my bed anxious for a new day to start, so I can take more.

————————————————————————————

The only time I take breaks is at weekends and that week when I’m waiting for a new script because I’ve consumed my monthly supply of pills in 2-3 weeks. I guess the reason why I said that I *think* I’m addicted is because I’m scared of admitting that I am.

I really want to take a tolerance break so they can be effective at my prescribed dose again but I’m actually really scared of taking a break.. why you might ask?

**I’m scared of...** Gaining back all of the weight I’ve lost - or more.

**I’m scared of...** Becoming unmotivated and unproductive, I have to study and get my grades so I can go to college - and if I’m not able to make music because of brain fog, losing my creativity and becoming unmotivated I WILL BE CRUSHED :(

**I’m scared of...** Facing my demons face to face again.. My depression and social anxiety will go back to how bad they were before I started taking amp. 

————————————————————————————

**QUESTIONS:**

• Can anyone relate to this?

• Do I actually have a problem or am I just overreacting?

• How should I do this? Should I look into any supplements? 

• How do I keep myself from gaining weight?

• How do I avoid brain fog,!stay productive and motivated in school and in general? **And stay creative!?**

• I’ve been thinking about asking my doctor to put me on Ritalin (methylphenidate) until my tolerance is back to base, could that work since they are two different substances?

• What can I expect during the break?

Everyday,  for 6 months has been absolute torture.  We've had 2 good days where he promised to stop going on the internet searching for anything and everything.  

I even showed him my fb, all platforms and then he decided to come up with ""the cops are doing it to us trying to separate us"". Now I'm also a cop because I refuse to go along with it. 

I'm exhausted.  I'm broken. I cant feel anything,  but sadness and fear.

I know it’s not pretty but I want out of this I have no time to lose on grammar just word vomit,"Trying to quit adderall so I can move with my boyfriend in a couple of months and by quit I mean at least take 1/4 of my dose. I don’t like adderall, I just don’t like alone with myself more. I’ve been abusing it for some time, started with my now boyfriend who was my best friend/ roommate for several years and moved away in 2016. We both were in relationships  the entirety of our time distanced both whom didn’t trust or buy there was “nothing” between me and him previously. (There was a bond and connection, intimidating I am sure but it wasn’t ever what they thought...never was shady) ok so during 2016 till last year I become a shit head when I get taken from my shit paying job but fulfilling and rewarding and my graduate school and I’m offered a job as an executive who basically travels to bad ass places a lot and stays at hotels that one night could pay most of my rent. They’re basically gas lighting me with money and perks. I have been stuck. I was only 24 when I became a CEO and I thought it meant so much more. I wasn’t mature enough to know what was going on and what to do with no management and being just a “go through the motions with National so we can have our fun” I went from managing many people and government contracts, to spending money on dumb asses and being told not to get too involved in this or that basically low key, no attention being brought, etc. let’s not get into that other than it’s fucked me. 

Anyway he comes back and I panic bc he wants to go eat and catch up and I’m not only 25-30 lb skinnier than I was before, but my social ability was gone. My mood was shit. I don’t drink anymore and we used to drink. My communication skills are 100 fold and I’ve done counseling and generally al a better and more perceptive and understanding person than I was and I was excited to show that to him, but my mood disorder fueled by fear of abandonment, adderall, occasionally Xanax (baby dose) to get me out of a storm that leads me waking up in a dissociated state a couple times, 

Fast forward I use adderall for mood he comes over I was vacuuming like hey, everytime I’m either on it or coming off, then getting High, then we start to fall in love fell into place he was coming over more. I panicked. I didn’t want him to see how ugly my moods can get. So... more him means more adderall, I can’t reveal this yet to him... we work from home. Since we were already so close and never skipped an beat let’s just say it wasn’t long until we were together 24/7 and he was living here (he was moving job locations supposed to have moved from Florida to Colorado in January their whole company is remote right now and so they’re at home until 9/1, but he just found out he got the job he applied for within the same company but he’ll be started at the Dallas location which is close to where my home and his home he’s from is.... maybe a few hours drive. 

I told him I didn’t want to move with him until I proved I would get my shit together and stop taking these pills and hurting our relationship. He was in a horrible funk  working overtime like a dog. Didn’t need to. He’s just a workaholic. IM sure my behaviors weren’t readable and it contributed a lot to him getting lost in work. He always asks why I’m never in a good mood to see him and I want to die about it I have been honest with him recently and rock bottom. I know he loves me enough to do anything for me and I don’t doubt his support. I have had his back in his lowest low and so has he and we’ve always had the safety bond with each other, 

Strsss of his recent news he has to move by end of April despite the work from home till 9/1 I think fucked him up. At first he started accusing me of cheating and doing things behind his back. He even went through my phone. Abnormal behavior from him... then he’d breakdown and say sorry he can’t stop doing stuff like that and sabotaging and it’s all he wants why is he doing it etc etc I was patient and loving until it got unbearable and almost like he wasn’t him. He wasn’t ugly or manipulative it was just trying to reason with a  18 year who has a million insecurities he also was so ready for change from working 10-8 non stop (work from home but he still ran to the bathroom and back out bc he couldn’t miss a beat) so I never saw much of him during the work day and I became unproductive popping addys all day, evening, night, you name it. Anything to pacify my moods. Now that it’s approaching for him to move it’s clear we’re both losing our grips. We Both have crossed each other’s lines for the first time and are both hurt and broke by it. We both realized we triggered narcissistic ex trauma and we can’t believe we’ve gotten here (the arguing only started 9 days ago...... after he found out. But it was 9 straight days of it) it never got inappropriate or had any disrespect until two days ago. We finally have calmed and reasoned enough to be somewhat stable and just focusing on loving one another knowing times short until he moves, and then we both know deep down neither of us are emotionally capable of withholding that kind of distance with our current state of mind right now and it’s scaring us because we want nothing else. It’s what we’ve planned, dreamed and have been waiting for. 

He is brilliant and started his new position Monday and it’s 7-4, he’s worked at home and I’ve gone to my office more to try to normalize how things will be wirh covid.  Anyway he’s so busy with his new job, and extremely happy with the change bc he was so overworked and stressed to a point of passing out multiple times where idk what would’ve happened had he been alone.... so I am all in all ecstatic and so happy for my man and his health and happiness bc happy him is happy me. Except day 9 of our arguing sent me into a place that’s dark and has emotions that are like exposed nerves . Like no shield. I am hurting I am hating myself I am hating everything that’s happening and all the barriers between us.  I am silenced. I used to have him here all day and he’d work and i would mostly not get shit done and just do things at home and spiral deeper into no motivation and addys and getting high. 

Anyway, I get that. It sucks when the person you relied on in such a sad and unhealthy way is busy to help you at your low lows (obv he would but I wouldn’t ever take away from his career, he’s not overworking anymore he’s healthy he’s happy) now I’m stuck with feeling like I was the happy optimistic one for so long and helped him see that something so good was coming and we just had to wait through the monotony and the drill and it would change and here I am unsure if I’ll even get to go, ever be the woman I want to be for him and myself, and I refuse to be a drug addict in his life letting him treat me like I’m special or valued I just ... I’m realizing I can’t accept his love right now because of the many compounded things wrong with me I woke up after all this info trauma and ptsd triggers and I felt nothing but disgust for myself and worth nothing. Don’t love myself anymore, how can I possibly tell him i am going to love him unconditionally when there’s this one tiny condition.....I just want to tell myself everytime I open my eyes “dude, fuck you.....” 

I have to figure something out. Yes it’s the drugs but more so it’s what is making me so dissatisfied with myself I am using the drugs. Counselors haven’t helped, psychiatrists or psychologist (he just ghosted me 2 weeks ago) we have appts for couples counseling and individual as well but no openings for several weeks. I don’t want to lose him again, i don’t want to have nothing more to offer than this ... someone hit me with some truth that will help (not your typical obvious please I’m begging you, please tell me something to encourage me to keep going, to focus on the positives in my life and the negatives that keep me from them.....",2,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.80382264}"

I was thrilled to pass the 100 days milestone the other day. Triple digits feels legit. It was a big moment I was waiting for and it came with some strong emotions. 🎉 

I have some pretty good days here and there but unfortunately I have been missing the feeling of experiencing “highs” lately. Moments of having a natural “buzz” are pretty rare and fleeting. I miss feeling excited and highly motivated. 

It’s still difficult for me to find focus and joy in activities and a lot of days it can be hard for me to keep my eyes open and stay awake. This has been making me pretty irritable and negative lately.

I’ve had a drop in appetite lately which has also been pissing me off.

Every day I definitely recognize and appreciate the Pros of being clean from amphetamines. Here are some benefits that I make sure to take note of and appreciate:

⭐️ My emotions are a hundred times more stable. I am much more able to look past my ego in “negative” situations and things feel a lot less SERIOUS. On Adderall overreaction was my only reaction. I am really enjoying being able to let things go and finding peace.

⭐️ I am nicer to people and much more calm and confident in social situations. Having a spontaneous conversation with someone holds a lot less pressure and I am less manic.

⭐️ I have more money on hand from less impulsive spending and from not purchasing alcohol or marijuana.
---
I’ve been having stomach issues (anxious stomach, heartburn) and trying to figure that out. Adderall used to bring calmness to my stomach (temporary with strings attached).

I am proud to have reached 100 days and I feel confident having some distance from Adderall. People in my life have been very encouraging and supportive. I will continue to avoid alcohol and marijuana. I look forward to reaching “orbit” (the point where I have so much distance from Adderall that it doesn’t even cross my mind).

I used Adderall daily for five years. My brain is still healing right? I can expect to feel more clarity and natural highs in the future right?

Rewind 3.5 years ago I was prescribed Vyvanse for ADHD. Helped a ton (I thought), used as prescribed until I didn't. A months supply of pills were gone in the first 5 days, rinse and repeat. Until I found myself hospitalized for my 3rd panic attack.

I had generalized anxiety after that for a good month. Just scared of being scared. It was the worst month of my life but a great wake-up call. I stopped taking Vyvanse cold turkey after that. 

I battled with anxiety for months after that but got things back together. A year later I came down with another bout of anxiety due to something unrelated and developed some awful symptoms, mostly with my ears. Eventually I went on Lexapro and that seemed to do the trick.

2 weeks ago I was feeling very sluggish despite eating well and working out. I set up an appt with my doc thinking it was the antidepressant and guess what? They prescribed me adderall. I thought I could take it as prescribed, but tomorrow is day 7 and the pill bottle is empty.

The good news is that I spoke to a psychiatrist a few days ago and will be starting Bupropion soon. I asked to stop taking the adderall. I'm also sober from alcohol for the better part of a month and am physically healthy minus this past week. The other positive that came from this is that I realized I am much happier sober, and not just because of the SSRI. I truly feel better off stimulants, no two ways about it.

The other day I took 70mg in the morning when I wasn’t working as I had a big day ahead of me and it was awful, not normally how I feel when I take vyvanse at all with side effects like jaw grinding and weird kind of anxiety/restlessness. 

This really worried me because it’s not like it was a new dose for me and concerned how I had not noticed it at work. 

I’ve also been noticing dependence on taking it - bit of a sprawl here but periodically i’d get my overall routine in order and life would be working out well and randomly i’d wake up one day and just be too lazy to take my meds because i didn’t think i’d need them then i would just be unproductive and afternoon would roll around and since i don’t like taking them too late i would not and then just exist plainly for the entire rest of the day. It’s like when i don’t take them I forget how much BETTER i am on them. I don’t like that, since I want to be like at the level I am on them, but without taking them. lol

Though my quality of life has improved immensely since starting it just frustrates me that being on vyvanse is what it took to get me in this situation. 

I do nottt want to be dependent on it and I’m prone to having an addictive personality, which I don’t want to happen with that 70mg I took the other day that I really didn’t need to.

I would love to find like, someone who understands to talk to this about. While my doctor is fine, and keeps up with my doses and progress, I find it hard to talk to him about. 

When I first got diagnosed, I went mainly looking for answers and told him I wasn’t sure if I actually had adhd, just that I was struggling and while I have been prescribed vyvanse it still kinda plagues me that I don’t have adhd, and that I was just looking for a reason I was feeling the way I was and taking whatever stuck with a quick fix. Pushing this any further makes me uncomfortable (should it?) and I don’t want to fuck up getting scripts with my doubts and concerns if it turns out my worries are senseless. 

I also take his advice with a grain of salt as I always see that since high doses will make your tolerance go up, you should take break days, while he advises on increasing the dose (unless there are side effects) (which I guess I understand though)

Since I don’t really want to talk to him about this, I considered searching for a therapist (have been looking ages for one anyway) but I can’t imagine they would know much about adhd and stimulant medication unless they were specialists which is hard to find.

With other outlets for support (family, friends) I would only go to for emotional worries. Talking about adhd to others makes my eyes kind of roll? I have the assumption in my head that they don’t understand (even though they might!) but the credibility of someone who has been through it or very knowledgeable in the matter is a point of reassurance for me. Also i’m not sure if they know how much it affects my life because I often think I’m making it out larger than it has to be in my head.

Anyway, thank u for reading, where can I find support or even other peoples views/experiences for this? Should I just hash it out with my psych? Is my concern justifiable? Do I just suck it up and see where it goes?

tldr i guess :) addictive personality - worried about a vyvanse dependency. 
would rather not talk to my doctor about it incase i get cut. not sure if it actually is a problem but can see how it would lead into one, looking for guidance somewhere so it doesn’t become one!!",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.67299485}"

When I first started taking adderall I know I wasn’t in the right mindset. I had an addictive personality smoking weed 24/7 for 3 years before that. And a ton of other mental issues. 

At first my honeymoon period was great, I finally had the energy I never had before and everything was effortless. I started to love working and doing things I dreaded before with joy and ease. I was confident and more social. I was never had felt better in my life. I kept wondering where this feeling was all my life. I never wanted it to end. 

But as time went by I became obsessive over it, I was always counting my pills and counting the days for my next refill like it’s was Christmas. I realize how I never took that as a sign of addiction. 

Eventually it’s novelty started to wear off as my body was taking a massive toll. I’m sensitive to stims and my body and mind was never feeling well, I was severely sleep deprived and I was going days without eating and not supplementing my body whatsoever. I started to have terrible joint issues and bone pain. Without thinking I started to medicated more to overcome these symptoms. 

This eventually led to even greater mental issues. I was becoming violent and abusive to everyone I knew especially my partner and I  blamed everything else for my issues but myself.  I was into psychedelics and started doing acid a lot more thinking it would help my mindset and it did. It help me become more conscious of my problems and how adderall has been affecting my mental state and health. However, I didn’t quit at first and brushed off this idea because in my head I thought the medication was doing a lot more good for me than harm. 

At some I was emotionally broken and I was feeling my worse. I eventually stopped working and doing things I loved  and was withdrawing horribly from adderall daily and was always irritated from the body pain. So I thought I was just gaining a tolerance because 30mg wouldn’t cut it anymore so I started to up my dosage taking up to 60mg a day or just started taking more whenever I felt that energy gone. 
I wasn’t taking care of my body and my blood pressure was always sky high I could feel it all the time and it was making me constantly anxious because I was having chest pain near my heart. In the back of my head I thought I was going to eventually have a heart attack. 

because I was always anxious and my blood pressure was always going, I thought just taking more Ativan would help subside these symptoms. It just made things worse for my mental health and was just a terrible person at this point. 
So now I was using up to 5mg of Ativan and 60mg or more of a adderall without considering any my health, withdrawals or side effects. 

I was doing this combo for about 4 months and there was a point were my body and mind just could not take it anymore. I was on a complete downward spiral, i wasn’t working or studying anymore I was just taking pills and I was ruining my relationship with my parents and abusing my partner and was becoming violent. I had also done some unspeakable things to myself and others. I was in total regret and pain from the medication. I had severe back pain I never had experience and still suffer from today. So at one point I finally decided to listen to my rational mind and remembered my acid experiences to finally quit using. 

When I quit cold turkey I experienced a mental and physical pain like no other in my life, worse than breaking a bone. I was severely crippled, my muscles atrophied and was suffering from back pain and could not even walk a mile. So I decide to push through the withdrawal by resting in bed. I was stuck in bed for about a month before I was able to finally get out and start walking. But during that time I went through the worse. I wanted to kill myself everyday and just couldn’t cope with the pain and panic attacks from doing this. I was in massive regret over who I was and became. I just kept telling myself this will pass through and I will survive. 

Once I was able to move, I made and effort to exercise and move my body around again to help it recover because i was constantly aching. I wasn’t able to do anything I did before and I was very athletic. I couldn’t run or lift with out being in massive pain. I pushed through all that and continued a semi healthy routine to get my energy and muscles back. 
I eventually got a job so I could get my mind of things like suicide and keep myself occupied to avoid using pills to cope with my mentality 

Fast forward to today I’ve been sober for 5 months. I still smoke weed at times and I’ve had a couple acid trips that have left me confused about myself and my life. Since those trips Life hasnt been the same and I not sure what I’ve been doing and how to continue moving on. I’m pretty depressed everyday and in regret over that period. 
I dropped out of college and stop Pursuing my career. 
There some days I’m doing well and others were I just have no energy and motivation. Sometimes it gets bad we’re I start having suicidal thoughts again but I know that isn’t the way. But these intense feeling and suicidal thoughts make me want to just do adderall again so I can’t get energy back to continue on with my life. I keep telling myself maybe this time it won’t go wrong If I just stick to a low dosage and never over Medicate. 

I still think everyday about those bad experiences I had on adderall. But I also remember the great moments I had when I was finally doing and achieving things I hadn’t before. As I wrote before I keep telling myself if I use a lower dosage and not over medicate things could probably work. 

I’ve called my doctor again for a prescription and picked it up but I still haven’t taken a single pill. I’m terrified yet still want to use it again for that benefit but I don’t know what to do so I just put it off all the time and try to not think about it. I feel low energy today and emotionally low right now knowing I picked up a script and thinking of using it. 

Writing this post is helping me remember all that pain I went through and Reminds me why I quit using it. I guess low energy and motivation at this point in time is better than becoming addicted again and going through all that suffering again. 
I just hate those days where I feel adderall could help me just a bit. 

So Sorry for the long post and just kinda pointless rambling about my addiction. I’m just venting.",19,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5272301}"

Right when I got to my 8th month of staying clean, my partner's best friend came to our place with 2 grams of pure Amphetamine, and for a good price. Of course, as soon as I lay my eyes upon the deathly white stuff, 90% of it went up my nose all in the same night. The moment I felt that ecstatic rush throughout my whole body, along with the memorable and somewhat fulfilling pain in my nostrils, I knew I was a goner. I came to the conclusion that recovery has never been the right thing for me and I'd rather purposefully ruin this body than to allow it to ruin me instead as a punishment for not giving it what it needs. I'm not sure how long I've been awake and shaking uncontrollably like a helpless pup, but my mind is finally at ease, no longer battling its cravings for chemicals, no longer trying to forget the terrifyingly beautiful dreams of overdosing. Unfortunately some people really cannot be helped.

I don't regret it, though. All I can say is I'm sorry.

I am so confused.,"After 3 years of using my Adderall prescription 99% appropriately, I (21, now in my junior year of college) have recently found myself totally caught off guard in a cycle of extremely dysfunctional, dangerous, and devastating Adderall abuse. 

I am literally baffled. How could constant, severe disorder “sneak up” on me? How did I travel from point A to the point of my life being on its head, without even noticing until I am absolutely falling apart? I have slept only a handful of days per week for the last month — part of it “sneaking up” on me is due to the fact that I remember close to nothing, and have been in a state of perpetual amnesia and disorientation for a month straight. It’s a lot easier to overlook something when you can’t even muster a single fucking thought. 

I am finding my life suddenly falling to shambles. I’m worried that I am now very doomed in my immediate pursuits, mainly academic, and the dread that comes with that is frantic. Unbearable. Indescribable. 

I feel so afraid and so hopeless. But I need to come back and write a proper post about this. Tonight is not the night for that post — I should sleep soon. Tonight is for actually acknowledging that I am very, VERY deep in a cycle that is quickly destroying my life, and will kill me if I continue.

I don’t know what I am going to do, but that is not tonight’s problem to address.

Thank you for reading. I hope to make another post soon, but I really needed to say this to someone. I am scared. I am fucking astonished. I need help. In a big way.",50,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.9332615}"

I’m coming up on my 6 months clean from adderall and stimulant abuse that lasted years and years. It feels kind of surreal and hat it’s been so long since I’ve used but it’s been a fairly easy process after getting past the initial withdrawal wave. 

Lately I have been having very intense and vivid dreams about picking up adderall and going on to get an escort (had a sex addiction to go along with the Adderall). It was the strangest thing but last night my dream actually was like a direct sequel from the night before. I was asking the same friend for adderall even tho he doesn’t even use or have it in real life. 

Anyone else have some weird / intense dreams this far along? Other than the dreams i haven’t had many symptoms of withdrawal and I’ve managed to quit nicotine now too after a 13 year affair.
