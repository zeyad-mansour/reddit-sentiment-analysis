2021-12-28 04:18:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/rqbsoh/the_1st_step_to_solving_a_problem_is/,The 1st step to solving a problem is acknowledging there is one. The 2nd step is deciding to do something about it. (Trigger for mention of self-harm and suicidal thoughts),"Hey y'all - I'm a 27yo who started taking Adderall multiple times a week in Summer 2020, and I began logging my daily use after about a year. Since collecting these numbers, I've averaged 46.6mg/day and haven't been able to go more than 5 days without using (and most multi-day breaks happened during holidays or vacations I scheduled, in which I basically slept the whole time). 

Just wanted to share some data I've collected as well as a few observations I've had in this journey. I'm still *deep* in the woods, but the clarity I've had on the situation this month makes me feel hopeful.

[Unfinished - aiming to finish the year with my lowest weekly averages and the lowest 4-week total since starting. ](https://preview.redd.it/s8q2eiof19881.jpg?width=596&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6caaccdc35c762964f6b838a878c976ac330d2d1)

**Work:** 

* The entire reason I began taking excessive amounts of Adderall were to accomplish more at work, however, I realized the pace in which my mind functions on and off Adderall is like two pens drawing lines from point A to point B: 

1. Without Adderall, the first pen draws a slow, reasonably straight line from point to point. 
2. With Adderall, the other pen squiggles erratic loops drawing a slinky-like shape to connect the two points. 

* Both pens get from point A to point B in a similar amount of time, but while the first pen took a boring path, the path was straightforward and efficient. The squiggly line is enticing and fun, but the speed should not be mistaken for a higher level of productivity; it requires more energy and involvement to accomplish the same task. 
* I've also noticed that the ACTUAL WORK I need and want to do is basically unaffected by my use. What IS affected is my attention to unimportant tasks and details. I spend much more time perfecting the wording of my emails, drawing out to-do lists, focusing on the formatting of my workbooks and charts, etc. 

**Health:** 

* Days I hit triple digits meant no sleep, wanting to vomit with every bite of food, a non-stop feeling of nausea and headache, rapid heart rate - the works. 
* I've struggled with anxiety/depression/suicidal thoughts most of my life at varying levels of intensity, and I used to feel like Adderall was helping, but I was just kidding myself. Before, my lowest lows had me sobbing on the bathroom floor late at night, distraught at the strong desire to hurt myself or to die. Now, when similar waves hit me, I simply self harm and move on, emotionless. I recently checked in with a close friend who'd been there through the worst with me, and he was shocked to find out that my darker thoughts and cravings didn't subside like he thought but that I just stopped telling him about them because they didn't bother me anymore. That conversation made me realize that even though I *felt* better, my mental health had hit a more frightening state. 
* Additionally, I noticed the gums bordering my front teeth all began receding and bleeding. Brushing more frequently and thoroughly just made them bleed more. I normally have great oral hygiene, so I knew this was addy-related, but I didn't want to admit it. However, each time I took at least 3 days off, my gums would improve to about 80% of their baseline. 

**Mood:**

* I have fun on Adderall, don't get me wrong, but the highs are memorable while the lows are definitely more frequent. The euphoria was great for the first year, but it stopped hitting around the time I began this daily log, even when I started breaking 100mg/day in August. 
* I'd call what I get now more like a light buzz than euphoria - if I'm lucky enough to get it at all. The light buzz makes me chatty, more upbeat, and pleasant, however, my comedowns last longer than the light buzz does, and the comedowns affect my mood in awful ways. They make everything suck: nothing tastes good, music sounds irritating, listening to someone talk is painful and boring, people interacting with me irritates me, and people leaving me alone hurts my feelings - there's really no winning. 
* Everyone, including myself, either appears to be extremely gorgeous and perfect and good or a dumb POS who shouldn't open their mouth, depending on if I'm buzzed or coming down. The volatility is exhausting, and loved ones have definitely noticed and mentioned it. 

**Relationships with others:** 

* Segueing from the last point of ""Mood,"" my relationships with others have never been worse in my life. I've always been prone to oversharing and being generally awkward, but this has generally been excused as a charming quirk at my baseline. On Adderall, however, I feel much less pressure to be liked, which is freeing in a sense, but it's also made my behavior go a little out of control. 
* *Romantic*: The entire time I've been on this rollercoaster, I've been basically single, which is a stark contrast to my life from ages 15 to 25, where I was basically always in a long-term, committed, fulfilling relationship. My romantic life wasn't perfect before, and I was probably a little too dependent on relationships to bring me a sense of identity and belonging before - however, I've recently come to terms with the fact that I push men away now to have more nights to myself to binge. 
* *Friendships*: Furthering the isolation trend, I also pushed a lot of my friends away to have more nights free to either take Adderall or recover in peace. Hanging out and catching up feels like a chore, and I let texts go days without an answer. In general, I just haven't felt a desire to have boyfriends or friendships anymore, so I dropped the effort to upkeep. 
* *Work*: I don't quite want to go into detail here because it would require a thorough background of my particular work environment, so I'll summarize. The erratic behavior has been quite detrimental to the solid reputation I had previously built for myself, particularly because I overshare when stressed, take a bunch of random sick days because of stomach aches, and have generally acted less professionally this year. 

Overall, my usage has caused significantly more damage than it's been worth, and I'm finally willing to put in the effort to stop. It took me a long time to get here because I loved getting high so much that I convinced myself it was good for me and that I needed it for work. It doesn't help my productivity at work, and it causes countless issues that have consumed my life. I originally wanted to write about more specific things I noticed in the last two weeks through taking less after hitting rock bottom, but I think that'll be a separate post if I get around to composing those thoughts. Writing down these general observations has been helpful for me to solidify the conclusion that Adderall isn't worth taking for me anymore, and I hope it helps someone else too.",19,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.6677895784378052}"

I'm at a weird point now where I really don't want to get sober, but I *want to want to* get sober, and I don't know where to go from here. Everyone in my life wishes for me to get better, and I don't want to keep hurting them with my addiction, but I just really don't want to actually be sober. It's like two halves of me are fighting for completely opposing courses of action, but of course the one that says to get high wins most of the time. 

Is this a universal experience that I'm just overthinking?

Day 13 is winding down and I just got done catching up with a friend who I hadn't spoken to in three months.   I invited him over for some dinner tomorrow night so we can chat, shoot the shit, play some darts, etc.

If I was in the throws of a bender, I would have either not responded to him when he reached out, or responded and made some plans in a frenzy that I would never end up actually keeping.  That, or I would have kept them, but my place would have been a mess and there's no way I could have been a good host to a good buddy that, quite frankly, has been one of the most supportive friends I've had during my use.

Being able to be on your A-game in social situations is one of the biggest boons to my sobriety.   It feels good to feel ""normal.""   Being able to cook up some steaks with a buddy and dick around on pool/darts is highly underrated.

Re-kindling my romantic life down the road (I'm nowhere near ready for a girlfriend right now) is something that helps keep me focused on the big picture and sobriety, but in the meantime, it's really cool to be able to make plans and not worry about making a fool of yourself when it comes time to get together with people.

Some background: I have been struggling with adderall/vyvanse addiction for about 8 years (upwards of 80mg/day) and in the past 2 years have made significant progress on stopping and relearning what really matters to me/how to live my life free of stimulants. I have relapsed a number of times with my longest stretch lasting about 6 months. I am currently 13 days clean! 

I want to join NA and have been thinking about whether it's necessary to be completely sober (free of alcohol and all drugs, not just stims) in order to have the best chances of a successful recovery. I've never had anything close to my addictive relationship with adderall with any other substance but definitely would say I have addictive tendencies. Right now I have a few drinks a week but refrain from other drugs for the most part. 

So, my question: What are people's opinions on the benefits of going completely sober? Do you think it's necessary to recover from stimulant addiction? Does it totally depend on the person? I don't want to relapse again and as much as I fear being completely sober (it feels like I already have a big enough mountain to climb being clean of adderall!), maybe there's no other choice!",16,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9896389245986938}"

&#x200B;

Some of you on this sub may remember me as the guy who recommended cooking sandwiches as a part of a healthy recovery plan; I'm locked out of that account and have been mostly lurking for awhile.  I decided to start a new account today so I can actually participate in this sub more.

&#x200B;

I obviously danced with tina a few more times after I was posting here on the other account, and went through a really rough period where I couldn't string together three days of sober time.

&#x200B;

Today is day 12 for me, and long-term sobriety seems attainable for me for the first time in over a year.   What's different this go-round is that I actually sought therapy/psychiatry and was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, which made a lot of sense considering that emotional dysregulation was the primary catalyst of my use.   The new med they put me on has made abstinence totally bearable; I'm closing in on only two weeks clean but I'm already starting to feel joy trickle back into my life.  Today I ate a candy cane on my porch and looked around at the snowy neighborhood and smiled.

&#x200B;

I'm sorry for the Christmas rant, but I hope that everybody is having a good Christmas, and I look forward to actively participating on this sub going forward; I feel like it's going to be a key part of my continued sobriety.

I love and cherish all of you!

The last couple days I’ve been thinking about it battling the “oh that sounds so good” with “no it sounds fucking awful it’s just the addiction talking” 

I think it’s because I have been in a lot of pain recently and not able to do much at all. I started using because It took away my pain for a while and gave me energy to do things. But I know that it’s going to be horrible if I do. I know exactly what I’ll do which is basically nothing and afterwards I’ll throw away whatever is left and be horribly depressed for a while. After I come down my pain will be so much worse. Plus I have to go to the pain clinic to get my PK prescription refilled and there is always a small chance they will ask for a urine sample. If I were to fail it even once I think they’d take it away and my life would be unbearable. The pain killers are the only reason I am able to do the tiny amount of stuff I currently can. 

I could ruin my life so quickly and all for a drug I don’t even fucking like. Just need to keep doing what I’m doing until this passes hopefully soon because the more often I have to fight these battles the more likely it is the logical part loses. 

Ugh I just miss having extended periods of feeling good. Now I take a pill and feel less awful for about an hour.

I want to remove her from my life, but she truly doesn’t understand the concept of somebody actually WANTING to get sober, so I could never explain it to her and have her understand. Do I just ghost her and block her on everything, or do I explain? Also could use some words of encouragement to flushing them down the toilet. I am doing so good. I don’t want to loose myself again.

(Its disposed of now)

**When I take Adderall**

1. You only focus on certain video games, not what's important.

2. On the day of your refill, you end up taking one and not sleeping at all that night.

3. You end up masturbating about 8 times on the first day.

4. You're not as social, and aren't your goofy self. During the initial euphoria you are, but after that wears off and it truly starts kicking in, you're just a robot at that point.

5. Your sleep schedule is all over the place.

6. You're appetite is non-existent. You feel hungry, but you mentally and physically just don't want to eat.

7. You're constantly finding things to satisfy you, and those needs of satisfaction are ALWAYS changing. And if you can't find anything, it just changes your mood negatively.

**When I'm Adderall Free**

1. Your sleep pattern is much better. Seriously guys, when I'm not on this shit I sleep about 12 hours every night. 

2. You're eating better. I don't have the healthiest diet admittedly, but I at least eat way more than when I would do Addy.

3. You're yourself. My girlfriend calls me a ""crackhead"" meaning I'm goofy and always do the most random and funny stuff, but when I'm on Addy I just sit there picking at my facial hair staring at a wall.

4. My interests are much broader. When I'm on Addy, the only thing I think about are truck simulator games. When I'm not on Addy, I rarely play them now since its been associated with my use, but other games and hobbies grab my interest again.

5. Emotions are easier to control. Addy is like a turbo for your brain, so if something makes you a tiny bit nervous, be prepared to have a damn near panic attack over something so small.

6. You can be social when you want to. I'm typically an introvert, but I can socialize when I need/want to. When on Addy, I would just constantly go on and on with talking about whatever the conversation was about, I'm sure some people found that annoying.


That's it for now. I hope y'all can relate and maybe use this post as encouragement to create your own post/sign, whatever you wanna do. Now I just hope I can finally have the strength to tell my doctor I don't want this stuff no more at my next follow up.

I've done other drugs in the mix (Weed, Ecstacy, LSD) these past few years. Honestly I've been experiencing these cognitive issues since one day I had a bad high from smoking a lot of weed. I was using Meth but not on a consistent basis but it could be blame. I didn't start to fully get addicted until I really started having brain fog and it's been like this for about a full year. I stopped smoking weed 6 months because I knew it wasn't helping at all. With stimulants, I quit 3 months ago. 

Everyday I have a blank mind, I experience little to no pleasure in anything(nothing excites me anymore). Have chronic fatigue and constantly tired. Have a little energy through the whole day. Suffer badly from social anxiety that I avoid going out in public. Have very low self-esteem. Can't seem to be able to hold a conversation with anyone at all (even suck at small talk). Can't seem to speak coherently. My brain feels cooked.

But whenever I used drugs especially stimulants, I'd start to feeling like myself even though I think it was doing some serious damage in the long run. When I was in the psych ward and rehab, I felt like I was in a intermission. I started feeling more like myself. Could socialize better. Less brain fog. Actually made friends from there but being back in the real world, I feel so disassociated. I don't know if it was better when I had friends that could understand what I was going through.

Now I'm back to just being by myself constantly. I tried making contact with people outside from the psych ward or rehab but it either was unsuccessful or they just got too busy with their lives. I can't seem to make any friends at my new job. I mostly sit by myself on breaks. I don't know if this is because I inhibited myself from the real world by either getting way too high and putting myself into an institution or some sort of delayed brain damage.

I started journaling ""reasons to stop eating Adderall all day, every day,"" and filled up four fucking pages with pretty compelling reasons. I was gonna snap pics and post them in the spirit of the Redditor who inspired me, but I'm paranoid and my handwriting is very distinct (or so I'm told). I won't list all of my reasons because that would be a fucking long ass post, but I'll list the ones that really fuck me up:

-tachycardia every day

-the euphoria is long gone

-keeping my (ab)use a secret from literally *everyone* is destroying me

-im completely isolated from all my friends

-im wrecking my brain

-i got fired (not because of Adderall directly, but it contributes to my mental health problems, which ultimately got me fired)

-supplementing my scripts with [name redacted] and [name redacted]'s is expensive, and now I'm broke

-i can't relax enough to have sex with [my boyfriend]

-[my boyfriend] told me I'm an emotional wreck -- and I am

-ive been craving crystal and even texting with [name redacted] occasionally, hoping he'll come through

-ive been craving opiates because weed, alcohol, and benzos aren't enough to bring me down anymore

-i drink too much when I'm high

-my eyes have turned into sunken-in butthole eyes

-my gums bleed

-my teeth, jaw, and muscles in general are always sore

-my sleep schedule is fucked

-i would rather be dead than continue on like this

-the is absolutely not fun anymore

-i can't socialize...or do anything really...with it or without it

-i am so physically and mentally tired all. the. time.

-i go for days without showering or changing clothes

-my family, [my boyfriend], and my good friends would be furious and heartbroken if they knew how I *really* spend my days

-the only time I've acted on suicidal ideation and actually made an attempt was when I was coming down after a binge

-ive lost myself.

Felt super desperate and it sometimes really helps to talk to someone, even in your head like I'm doing right now, but, thankfully, I feel like I'm losing steam - a welcome change after last night not sleeping at all and very little over the weekend. Went from a little coke to even deeper in the absolute dick of a swamp that is speed for me. Posted just the longest Reddit post some time ago about how I feel I'm cycling back to my worst, when I just start on Wednesday, finish on Saturday night, have that panic creep in on Sunday, (thankfully) too tired to panic on Monday, shitty fucking Tuesday and thar she blows again just religiously.  
Not there yet, but this time I'm even closer to it than when I posted that Reddit post (how great that I described the whole week thing again too, lol). I went to work on Monday literally without any sleep, it's insane how lucky it is to have this job for so long, not appreciating that luck is even more insane man. What's making me bawl my eyes out right now is that at no point I give up, all the time I try to figure out how to keep doing the right thing, but at some point I just give myself a stupid fucking excuse and ""eh, what's a little coke"" when I fucking should know better, what the fuck is wrong with me man?!   
Duh, addiction, lol, but sometimes realising how fucking helpless I am just scares me so much man. Got so much love in me for so many things, it sometimes takes my breath away how beautiful existence on such a planet like this, and how lucky! I've even learned to love myself in a calm, appreciative way sometimes, and not to make myself even more miserable by hating my own guts for being an addict.  
But this sense of absolutely not being in charge, just spectating in absolute disbelief of what I have become sometimes is just so, so scary.  
Ok, I'm out, and while still distressed, at least I'm not desperate anymore, thanks whomever reads this, including you, imaginary friend, you insanely supportive guy/gal, you!   
Ordered some food, cold now probably, lol, but at least I think I'll actually finally eat and go to bed. 3:13am here, have to be at work 10am sharp. Pretty convenient for me to push myself into knowing I'll keep snorting tomorrow, fingers crossed I stop earlier so I can get at least 8 hours of sleep.

I (23F) was prescribed 10mg Dexedrine in Spring 2020 and stopped taking it June 2021. I wouldn't say I abused it, but I definitely became reliant on it. I didn't experience extreme withdrawls, probably because my dose was so low and although I would sometimes take an extra half pill when the first one wore off, I was pretty good at sticking to my script because I never wanted to run out before I could refill. Most of my ""withdrawl"" was more so learning how to become self-motivated without this crutch, and although I know I'm better off without it, I absolutely miss it. 

I miss when it would start to kick in as I was getting ready for work, and I'd become so much more excited for the work day. I miss how music would sound as I was driving to work and peaking, and enthusiastically texting my friends as I drove. I miss those first 2 hours at work with hyperfocus sending emails and coming up with new ideas.

What I don't miss is not being able to follow through on those ideas once it wore off and my energy was low. I don't miss going back and forth trying to decide if I should take a half of another pill to get through the remainder of the day, only for it not to work and just increase my anxiety. I don't miss skipping evening workouts because I felt so mentally and physically exhausted, I just wanted to get home and smoke weed to shake off that anxiety and gross speedy feeling. 

I don't know the exact point of this post other than to put my thoughts over the last 6 months into words. I know it ended up doing me more harm than good, so why do I still wake up in the morning wishing I had it? I'm very proud of what I've been able to accomplish without my crutch - moved states, started a new job and ran a half marathon. I really love my new job, and I'm proud of the fact that I've been off stimulants for the entirety of it, but on the days that are extra hard to get out of bed and find the motivation to get into work, it's hard to not miss my old mornings.",25,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.8375689387321472}"

I used meth heavily for about a year, then off and on for another year. I'm a musician and speed just seems to unlock a flow of creativity that I can't normally access. For the first few months I never experienced any kind of psychosis or paranoia. After I started smoking it all the time though, I started to get horrible paranoia until it started forming into whole schizophrenic delusions and full blown hearing voices. 

Every time I would relapse, the voices come back and I almost always end up in a psych ward. I've had 6 inpatient hospital stays over two years. I've even been diagnosed with schizophrenia, but I have a friend who actually has schizophrenia (not induced by drugs) and we have very different symptoms.
.
I've been clean for about a year, with one relapse that almost caused me to lose my job. Luckily I have very little desire to use anymore because the delusions are so scary. The thing is, when I get really stressed, the voices start coming back. They're always of people I know, usually it's at work and I feel like every conversation going on around me is about me. It's not bad enough that I feel I need meds, especially the shit they prescribe for this kind of thing.

I'm getting a bike tomorrow and plan to start exercising in hope to rebuild the density of my dopamine neurons. After reading about NAC, I'm wondering if it would also help repair the damage. Does anyone have experience with lasting psychosis and NAC helping with it? Will this tinge of paranoia every fully go away?",5,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.7758265733718872}"

I never abused it at all, I was prescribed 35mg IR and that's what I took for about 4 years.

But it was just problem after problem after the first  6 months of use, I just felt like my brain was fried and I couldn't function without dex, and after a while they didn't help me function all that well either, I guess that's when other people up their dosage and head towards abusing it, but I didn't go down that path, I just stuck to my prescribed dose and struggled along.

I decided to quit, because even though my psychiatrist said at that dosage I should be ok and be back to my old self after about a month, i had tried quitting before for a month to see what happens i was still pretty zombified.

So I quit for good, now its been 120 days and i don't know what to think. I mean... yes i do feel a bit better than i did a few months ago, but i can still barely use my brain for much of anything, for example writing this post is exhausting, playing video games is exhausting and I put off most tasks I need to do because i just dont have the mental energy for them. I am unemployed because i cant work.  I was a high paid engineer over the last 6 years and now i couldn't even function flipping burgers.

my main concern is that there is something else going on with me beyond just dex use, because i dont know if it should be this hard after 4 months. 

does anyone else have experience with feeling like this stuff melted your brain even though you didnt abuse it? I didn't think that at that dosage i would need this long to recover, i feel like this is the severity and duration that a legit heavy user/abuser would have to go through.

Will I ever feel normal again?,"Hi there guys. I am a prescribed Adderall user who had grown a nasty habit of abusing my IR medication over the past few months. It reached a peak rather recently where I was finding myself having frequent late night binges and upping my dose more and more just to feel normal enough to get out of bed every day. When I ran out of my prescription I would supplement by borrowing a shit ton of Ritalin from my roommate.

Recently I decided enough was enough and decided to switch to XR in the hopes that it would help limit my abuse potential. The only issue is that I am a college student currently in the middle of finals week, so I found pulling back on my usage very difficult during this time and found myself abusing this medication as well, and adding in Ritalin to supplement the effects. 

This all culminated two days ago, when I about 90mg XR , a Ritalin , and had caffeine. I had a MAJOR freak out on this dose and was convinced that I was dying until I realized it must have just been the medication. I had a panic attack that went on for literal hours, felt really intense physical symptoms of sweating and shaking and feeling out of my body and had to have friends sit by me and give me water and calm me down until it was all over.

The day after , instead of giving myself a break I tried to just take my prescribed dose (30mg XR) since I woke up feeling so horribly lethargic and had to write a huge paper. I ended up getting quite anxious and feeling out of my body in a manner similar to the day before and assumed it was just because I needed to give my body a break from the medication.

The following day (today) I woke up feeling so horribly lethargic and shitty again even though I slept for hours. I usually get brain fog before taking my medication in the morning but nothing like this. I tried to persist in spite of it because I wanted to give my body a break but I literally feel insane, like so fucking out of my body with blurry vision and like I need to keep touching my face and my body just to convince myself I'm still in it. I've felt like this all day now. I'm torn between feeling super anxious and super exhausted, like I'm on the verge of passing out at all times.

2021-12-12 06:00:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/rems39/my_life_is_empty/,My life is empty,"Until this week I had 6 weeks clean which is my record so I was doing well. However my life was still empty. 

I go to a day centre for drug addicts. That's all I do. I don't really have friends. I have one good friend who lives in another country and I have one good friend who lives in my city, unfortunately the latter never really seems to have time for me. 

I also had this flirty thing going on with this guy in the day centre. Honestly, if it weren't for him, I think I might have given up on the day centre by now. Not that it's awful, but he honestly improves the day so much. We live very near each other so we walk home together and support each other - unlike with regular friendships, we are comfortable (and it doesn't tire us) spending most of our time talking about our problems and helping each other. 

He asked me out on a coffee date last week and it went well, however he didn't want my phone number. I'm not sure why - there was an awkward silence when he said no, which I filled by saying ""well, we see each other every day anyway"" and he was like ""yeah exactly"" - so while I don't doubt that that could be part of the reason he didn't want it, I don't know if there was something else. However the flirtatiousness continued, the next two days he asked me to wait for him a few minutes at the end of the day so we could walk home together, so he clearly still enjoys spending time with me. 

Last Friday I fucked everything up with something I won't go into, I didn't do anything terrible but it definitely made him feel uncomfortable, which led to me eventually relapsing on Monday. Monday-Wednesday this week the day centre was closed. On Thursday, we didn't speak, which I interpreted as him being angry at me. On Friday one of the other patients came up to me - she'd noticed that something was going on - saying she'd spoken to him, and explained that it wasn't that he was angry, he was giving me space because I, being upset over the situation, very angry (at myself) and having relapsed, was not exactly approachable. So I went up to him (it was the end of the day by this point) and apologised for what I had done and it was all hugs and smiles. We walked part of the way home together but once we sorted everything out he dashed off because he had to be somewhere.

The patient that talked to me about this told me she ""understood my confusion, not only because of how you act with him, but especially because of how he acts with you"" which is...vague. There's two possible interpretations: 1) he told her that he wasn't into me in that way or 2) he didn't fully explain my fuck-up on the Friday and therefore she misunderstood something (this would make more sense if I could be arsed to explain my fuck-up, but trust me here)

I guess I'm explaining all of this because at the moment, waiting to see how things are tomorrow with him, I'm nervous that things might not exactly be back to normal. It's going to be especially difficult to tell, because I won't be able to walk home with him tomorrow or the day after, and that's the only considerable amount of time we get alone together, and even then, it's not always just us two because sometimes the other patient I've mentioned joins us - which is how she'd seen us being all flirtatious. 

And the thing is, even if they are back to normal, the fact that he didn't want my phone number says to me that, while he did enjoy our coffee date - he told me so twice, and I can just tell from his facial expressions etc - it maybe didn't go quite as well as he was expecting. He did also say on Friday that he thought we probably should stick to seeing each other at the day centre (+ walking home), although it's hard to know if that's just because we had literally just sorted out a problem of me being a dickhead. So maybe at some point - but probably not soon - that could change. But it seems to me that, for now, things aren't going anywhere. I'll try to just enjoy the flirtatiousness, especially as this is literally the first time that anyone flirts with me, and was the first time someone invited me on a date.

So why am I telling yous about this guy? Well, the thing is, apart from the day centre, he's the only thing I have going on in my life. And even then, I don't get to see or speak to him outside of the day centre. I functionally don't have any friends or hobbies. Because of the anhedonia that comes with meth withdrawal, I don't really enjoy anything, especially not new things (possibly anxiety-related). 

I would love to go and meet new people but I just don't have the social skills, and because my life is so uninteresting I have nothing to talk about, and even if I do manage to make conversation, the other person often loses interest in me. If my day centre squeeze were a bit more into me I would probably ask him what he sees in me, but we're not at a stage where that would be a semi-appropriate/understandable thing to ask. 

I need to develop the social skills and confidence to meet new people and do new things, but I feel like for that to happen I need to have more positive life experiences, because the things the professionals say to me don't tend to sink in, even if I fundamentally agree with what they say.

Should I be concerned?","I was originally diagnosed with adhd when I was in 5th grade but my parents said “Adderall is a terrible drug” and I never was put on it. Once I went to college I saw myself struggling I went back to the doctor, was rediagnosed again with adhd and began taking 15mg extended release adderall. 

I saw my grades shoot up, mood improved, and I was able to focus so much better. This was about 6 years ago. 

Today I’m still taking the 15mg, but am taking it every day. I have never taken more than my limit but have recently been thinking that I might want to bump it to 20mg since I feel the effects are not really there anymore.

My step parent was an alcoholic who spoke freely about it with me ever since I was little so I think I might be hyper-nervous about addiction generally.

When I have days where I don’t take adderall it feels like I wasted a day. I’ll end up sleeping in until noon, eat fast food and watch tv. I guess I just feel sluggish- like I used to in elementary school.

However when I take my medication I feel so much more productive and alert that I feel happier.

I’ve had a fun little relapse of my eating disorder this year which has resulted in a lot of stimulant abuse.

I started the year by blowing through the approx. 5 months worth of extra 70/60mg vyvanse I had saved up in about 2.5 month (I was prescribed two pills a day and skipped the second dose a couple months in a row) and at my peak I’d taken 6 of the 70mg pills in one day. Then early to late March I ran out. Obviously the regular vyvanse dose didn’t work anymore.

In April I had my psych switch me to Mydayis (16 hour Adderall) and was given 50mg twice a day. When I had sleeping issues he wrote me a “trial script” for two 37.5 mg pills a day, while still giving me my normal 100mg a day script if that didn’t work out. Of course I didn’t bother trying, had the thing filled and spent a couple glorious months eating thru these 60 bonus pills.

Since running out I have convinced my psych to prescribe me 125 mg of Mydayis a day. But I’d taken more than that in recent months. I’d just abused the medication enough to where my regular functional dosage had to be bumped up to something closer to my abuse dose. I still occasionally take extra alongside it. 

Alongside this—I had been taking modafinil regularly for several months of this, usually just one pill or a half one (although earlier this year it was multiple pills sometimes mixed with Armodafinil). Ran out of those a month or two ago and haven’t bothered trying to get more since.

I added Bronkaid back into the mix in March. Their new formulation is now only 25mg ephedrine and nothing else. This being the easiest to get it has been a heavily stable part of my daily stimulant regiment up until about a week or so ago when I finally gave it a break after 8 months straight with no real breaks. I’d take up to like 10-12 of those suckers a day usually. 

In May or so albuterol entered the picture. Yes the medicine used in inhalers but in tablet form. People use it to lose weight. I didn’t take it for a couple months in the middle but as of the last month or two it is back. 4mg tablets, would take up to maybe 8-10 of those a day, still take ballpark around that.

I’ve tried benzedrex a couple times, twice on the same days as my mydayis, albuterol, and ephedrine. It was great the first time but the second time it hit way too hard and made for an unpleasant day so I don’t use it as much. 

Finally I’ve had a bottle of yohimbine extract since March but rarely use it because it causes me to get intense anxiety, my jaw gets all clenched, and I get really snappy and irritable. But sometimes it enters the mix.

So for a majority of the months since May I’ve taken extremely high doses of Mydayis, ephedrine, and albuterol multiple times in the same day—usually 7x a week—and for a while modafinil was in the mix, and some times yohimbine gets added to that mix. There’s been at least one day where I’ve taken all of those stims in the same day, or for sure all of them together except for modafinil.

I know this is all weaker stuff but this is where worrying about my weight because some fucking POS called me fat in the past has gotten me. I go to the gym excessively. 6 times a week, sometimes 7. Usually for 2-3 hours. Mix of weights and cardio. I fear trying to go to the gym without stims.

This is the second time in my life I’ve had major stimulant abuse issues. The first time was also eating disorder related and when I started the ADHD medication that time I took enough of it to lose 40lbs over around 4 or 5 months. This time I did a bunch of shit to get extra meds from my doctors and friends and there was a period where I would take high doses of vyvanse alongside Mydayis, Dexedrine, and Adderall all in the same day—alongside 1000s of mgs of caffeine (xenadrine tablets) and extremely high doses of ephedrine. I stopped this habit for about a little over a year and then at the beginning of this year in January it started all over again.

I really want to try 2FMA since it’s so hard to find extra ADHD meds for me now but that’s proving just as hard to find.

I hit my lowest weight of my life over the summer.

Anyway idk why I’m sharing this. Just felt compelled to.

I have been taking various types of amphetamine nearly every day for almost four years now (including Adderall, Vyvanse, and Dexedrine, to name a few). What I’ve noticed is, despite popular opinion, the withdrawal symptoms of Adderall appear to be immensely more tolerable than that of drugs where the only active chemical is dextroamphetamine, such as with Dexedrine or Vyvanse. If I take either of those two consistently for just a few days and then stop, that would be enough to render me near dysfunctional, to the point where I can’t even get out of bed for days.

Basically, the withdrawal of 100% dextroamphetamine absolutely annihilates me. However, I can take a drug like Adderall (which consists of dextroamphetamine, though not entirely) for months, abruptly cease intake, and the absolute worst withdrawal symptom out of any I may experience is just some boredom if anything; it’s not like I can’t get out of bed, end up sleeping several days away, can’t think straight, etc. I am completely functional. I just feel a little numb is all.

Despite this, it appears as though the majority of people still prefer drugs like Dexedrine or Vyvanse over Adderall, especially in a recreational sense, whereas I view it the other way around. I just was curious if anybody agrees with me, or perhaps knows why I am affected by each of these medications the way I am.",8,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9979396462440491}"

The longest I'd managed prior to that was 2 weeks, so a big improvement. 

However, I am concerned. During week 7 nothing bad happened to me. And some very good things happened. Yet I had this weird tension the whole week that on Friday resulted in me blowing up in someone's face. I was distraught the Saturday and Sunday because of anger at the other person and also possible consequences, then on Monday I relapsed. As soon as I relapsed I had a sensation of calmness and clarity and realised how much of a dick I had been, he in fact had done nothing wrong. 

This all makes me think that maybe my emotions were more withdrawal-related. Meth isn't exactly known for having people get in touch with the better parts of themselves, so I don't think it's the effects of the drug, but I guess relieving me of negative effects of withdrawal could have resulted in what I had happened.

I struggle with Adderall abuse. I started regularly taking Adderall when I was about 25 (I'm 34 now) and entered nursing school. I had taken Adderall recreationally beforehand, just occasionally to study. I knew I would be working and going to school full-time and a script would really help me. Never did I think that it was possible for me to cross the line into addiction. I come from a family of addicts (dad, brother, sister) and always thought I had escaped that gene.  


Anyways the first year or so of being prescribed Adderall I took it normally. The second year is when I started asking for my doctor for an increase in dosages and consistently running out before my next refill. It got to the point where I was using my 40mg daily IR monthly prescription I was using in a weeks time. Around this time I started supplementing with coke when my Adderall script would run out. By this time I was had been addicted for about 2 years. This binging, recovering, supplementing with coke continued for another 5 more. So I would say 7 years of very heavy stimulant addiction. This was also a time where I still continued to accomplish alot, though I struggled to keep it together. I got through a masters program (after being put on academic probation.) I struggled financially and put myself into a pretty deep financial hole, was using other recreational drugs regularly like molly etc. I gained a ton of weight. My teeth started to have major issues.  


In 2018, I met my now husband. The first year we knew each other I continued to use. In April 2019, I graduated with my masters, moved in with Jeff, and quit Adderall. I wish I could tell you the reason. I had just had enough of the binging and recovering. I thought about it every day for about a year. It sucked. I had no motivation, I was depressed. I'm not sure how I continued to stay sober to be honest. It took me two full years to start feeling like I was thriving again. I got treatment for some underlying mental health issues finally that I think had contributed to my addiction issues (OCD.) I even told my new psychiatrist about my history with Adderall abuse and that I should never be prescribed it should I ever ask.  


One thing I will add here is that I had a couple slip ups. Not big ones by any means. One was offered while camping. And had another offered to me. Both times I took it, severe anxiety ensued. Was happy for the experience because it took me back to that anxious feeling and helped me to solidify my choice to recover.  


Fast forward to Summer 2021. 2 years sober. Engaged to be married in July. Down 20 pounds. In recovery from a lifelong battle with OCD. Happy.  


I asked a friend if they had any Adderall for my upcoming bachelorette party. I had been sober for 2 years. I could handle a limited amount for a fun weekend. The friend didn't have any - but other friends did and brought me some to the party. I took them, had a blast, had a recovery period and then moved on with my life. Wouldn't even call it a blip.  


A week before my wedding in July, that same friend I had asked let me know he now had Adderall in and ""basically an unlimited supply."" Well, that is all it took. From a week before my wedding in July until today, I have been high. Taking anywhere from 90mg-240mg daily. Spending thousands of dollars (from my savings I had built up from the years long battle of digging myself out of my financial hole.) I have regained all the weight I lost and am now the heaviest I have ever been.  


This week I told my husband. I was honest with him before we married about my struggle and I told him I wanted out and I needed his help. Tomorrow is Day 1. I have the next 4 days off work to recover. I'm worried I've set myself back to the point where it'll take another two years to recover. I thought I had this, and it took something as simple as the availability of it to put me back down even further than I was before.  


I read about SMART recovery on this sub. I'm going to try it. I want to do recovery the right way this time, now that I know how easily it can slip back up on you. My goals: Get back to where I was before I relapsed: Getting healthy and happier.

My girlfriend’s mother has been using meth  daily for the past 28 years. Orally, doses of 50-100 mg. She has constant paranoid thoughts, headaches nearly daily, and severe stomach ulcers. She’s getting older, and both my gf and I are worried about the long-term effects stacking up and causing a heart attack/stroke/whatever else, as well as the current limited ability to function in society she suffers from. As well, it’s caused some legal issues in her past and present. 

The issue is that she’s completely ignorant of its detrimental effects; she doesn’t believe that it could have negative effects and views it as medicine. Without it, she says she is suicidally depressed and unable to function. However, her longest time of abstinence was 6 months a few years back.

I got a nice brand new house to move into. Nicest place I ever called home.. just started a new job for really nice money and pretty much have all I worked for in the past year.  I wanted all these things for my entire adult life and now I have them.  Only thing is having no furniture which was lost due to a mold problem under my old apartment.  Just got the key to the new spot on Friday and it's amazing.  So much to do ... 
  So it took 10 months of daily meth use to get what I wanted and worked for,  for over 28 years in the trades.  
 This is the positive part of my asshole addiction. I overcame opiates about 10 years ago only to push myself to the point of nearly going insane with this shit.  I thought it was all about the energy.  No idea what the escape was like until daily use. It was comforting to know that I could numb my emotions so readily and pretty much avoid any little things that would normally make me a  nervous, aggressive,  emotional wreck.  Actually calming to me after a while.  Usual ROA was sniffy and sometimes eating.. hotrails were my favorite. 
I have so much to do and be happy about but I have ZERO MOTIVATION TO DO ANY-FUCKING-THING.

I can't afford another day in this hotel.  I have like $6 to make it to work for 2 weeks. However,  I can always get some more meth on credit.  
 With all that said....

So I got switched back to lisdexamfetamine for my ADHD and its actually been great this time and is helping me a lot, however they upped the dose after the initial one started off great but then my mood felt very flat and I felt somewhat like I was having anhedonia and didn't then really want to do anything, since I felt meh and didn't care. They upped it and now it's back to feeling great and working.... but seriously there's still always this mood dulling feeling where I don't feel like myself or enjoy life as much, even if I function.

My rant is that I am just so angry that sobriety off everything doesn't help me and that I do clearly need some kind of medication to function, yet I was doing so much better in like when I was using cathinones to function and self medication with them (until I abused them to escape emotional pain). They were like the perfect ADHD medication and mood enhance, yet stable, drug for me and I just don't get why it worked so much better using this as and when vs any of the actual medication I've tried.

I recently got the chance to get hold of some mephedrone again and I am so horribly tempted to have it and try going back to just using it as and when needed at lower amounts, but can I actually trust myself to do this after how bad I ended up on it? :(

I also came across Wellbutrin as being an off label adhd medication where people who tried it said it helped and gave them an elevated mood that fixed their depression and anxiety and also didn't impair libido (often increased it)... which sounded like all the plus things I got from using cathinones. I then read that Wellbutrin IS basically a cathinone. So now I'm kinda excited that this may be an option over lisdexamfetamine for ADHD management.

Has anyone here used it? How did it go for you and would you recomend it for depression and ADHD. I'm not sure they will prescription it in the UK for this method, so may involve me going private again if that's the only way... but I'm curious to try it because it basically sounds like my ideal ""why can't they make cathinones into an ADHD medication? Because the amphetamine and CNS based ones aren't agreeing with me"".",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9975311160087585}"

A little background: I first tried cocaine in 2020, right before pandemic. It was a party setting, and back then I went using for a month, usually weekend only, until I quit for a year. 2021 I went back to the party setting, started with ecstasy here and there, got reintroduced to coke, and then every other weekend, turned into every weekend. I would say every weekend, and sometimes weekdays, for the past 3 months. Last time I used, was this Sunday, so about to be a week. I decided I want to quit. I’ve never had a drug issue before that made me scared of relapse I guess. So I am kind of new and scared since I know I played around with a hard drug. I’ve been wanting to quit, and came back a couple of times due to social pressures. Now, I never used it without alcohol. I’ve never craved it without alcohol, so it is strictly party related. I know that since deciding to quit, I need to stop drinking too, and partying. However, I don’t want to forever be bound to relapse because one day I went out and had a drink… I’m scared I messed my brain up and life permanently that I never get to have fun anymore. I want to one day be able to get drunk with friends without even thinking of cocaine. But my safety and health first right now. I am willing to make the sacrifices to quit right now and do whatever it takes to cure this. I just need your advise, anyone who’s been through this. Will I ever recover? Will I ever be able to drink again? What is recovery path like considering my facts? What timeline am I looking at here? I just need to know where I’m headed. I need to know what to do if I do find myself drinking and wanting. I just need words of advise, words of encouragement, and a little guidance. Cocaine for me is dead and I do not want to ever return. The risks are not worth it, the calm downs are not worth it. I just want to put it behind me forever, and be able to live my life as it was before I was ever introduced to this.

Me and my partner took speed on Thursday. Binged for 3 days with no sleep. Then my partner got a bath.

She ran the bath got in while playin tunes. Then she got out and popped her head in the bedroom sayin thought i heard the dogs rootin thru a bin bag.

When she got back in the bath i heard her start to masturbate. Then the loud sex started. Loud and blatant. The music had stopped but the tap was constantly running.

I went to the bathroom door and i definitely heard it , but im passive aggressive and non confrontational and was probably wired with no sleep so figured id confront her after since there was no denying i heard it.

But when she finished 'in the bath' it sounded like the guy was waitin in the other room and shed get up every few minutes to go see him.

Her mother came home from work and it sounded like the guy slipped out the door when mother went thru to the kitchen.

When my partner got back in bed after sayin hi or whatever to her mother she got back in bed. Im sure she said 'sorry babe' and was cryin , so ready to dump her ass i turned and said 'has he gone now?'.

However , she denied it all. In fact her and her mother blew up goin mental sayin it nevwr happened and it was coz of the drugs and bo sleep.

I cant find any personal experience stories on google to compare to , and medical pages dont really help either.

I have a high tolerance for most drugs , and would be 1000% convinced it happened if i hadnt googled wether 'paranoid auditory delusions' were possible after a binge.

Everythin else happpened in reality when i questioned it. The events : she ran bath , played tunes , popped her head in , fucked someone while the tap was running , got stuff outa wardrobe , made a brew ..

She says thats all correct , except the fuckin another dude bit. So between her poppin her head in and comin back to find underwear , i had a delusional episode ??

Reasons i believe it happened : i heard it , everythin else actually happened

I’m a quiet person and don’t make many close friends, but two years ago I finally wound up with a friend that I really connected with, enjoyed hanging with, felt emotionally safe around, and who seemed to give as much as she received in terms of a balanced friendship. (I’m a naturally introverted, laid-back person and often happy as a listener.) 

Anywho, about 7 months ago my friend was feeling super burnt out from college and f/t work and asked her doc for a prescription. Doc has her take a test and tells her something like “I can’t believe you’ve coped this long without it, holy cow, here’s your Adderall.” It struck me as worrisome because I’ve worked closely with this person; honestly, she has always been highly successful in her work without a struggle. She wanted it because she was severely overworked, sleeping very little, and in a difficult college program. 

What I didn’t expect was for it to change her personality SO much. Very quickly after she started taking it, I found myself less and less excited to see her, to the point where I came to dread it. I thought I was a bit nuts for thinking that because, according to her, “everyone is on Adderall, it’s that common.” So I initially doubted myself when I began seeing concerning things. 

But it subtly changes her in so many ways. She becomes overly self-assured and narcissistic; she often says hurtful things without seeming to notice it. She has boundless energy and sometimes seems annoyed that I’m not overly excitable/energetic with her. She’s incredibly proud of her medication-induced lack of appetite and subsequent weight loss, and it’s mentioned constantly. And it’s made her the social butterfly I guess she didn’t feel confident to be before, but even that is often pushed on me in an ego-centric “look how many new friends I have and you aren’t invited” sort of way. 

Anyway, she finally took a “day off” the other day and she was totally herself again. The fun, spicy, outspoken friend that is good to be around and aware of me and my feelings, too. But, then she basically said she hates how she feels on a “day off” because she feels lazy and depressed and unfun. 

I don’t feel like I can say anything to her because she loves her new self on this drug. Her doctor has told her she needs it and upped her dose. There’s no way I can say something to her about it and come out winning, I feel. I want to help her, but she’s even got her husband on a script for himself now so they “chase dopamine together.” But, I definitely don’t want to be in her life anymore when she’s so very different and, honestly, hurtful- I’ve got some pretty good issues with anxiety myself. Again, thanks for letting me talk here. I never expected to lose my bestie to a prescription.

I just a couple friends I relapsed over the weekend and am waiting for their response.

Monday was horrible, tried to shoot up but failed and decided I'm not gonna fucking do this, I'm not gonna let one relapse turn me back into a full blown meth addiction.

Tuesday was easier but today was pretty shit. 

Even tuesday I felt like I really, really, really wanted to do meth WAY more than any day last week or before that.

I hate myself for letting myself relapse. Like, you have no idea how much I regret Sunday. I'm constantly crying because I feel like my life is absolute trash compared to when I'm meth and on top of the world. 

A few months ago I was having urges but talked to a few friends and went onto a whole fucking rant about a whole fucking rant about how there's nothing to worry about because I'm not the same person as I was as a teenager and can control myself just fine.

But I just went and fucking relapsed like a stupid idiot failure dammit.",10,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9990320205688477}"

Was through the withdrawals and finally feeling myself. But still having problems sleeping so last night I caved and filled my ambien prescription which caused a domino effect of usage.. Took dexedrine today as well as picked up Kratom. I feel so ashamed of myself.. I was so confident I was done for good. Even my parents were telling me tonight how proud of me they are but I couldn’t bare to tell them I fucked up, so I smiled and said thank you. 

Tomorrow is a new day, day 1 of being sober. I know. I can do it and this is just a hiccup but man I hope I didn’t set myself back much. I do not want to feel those withdrawals I had again the first 10 days, it was torture. Not sure why I do this to myself..",28,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9950993657112122}"
