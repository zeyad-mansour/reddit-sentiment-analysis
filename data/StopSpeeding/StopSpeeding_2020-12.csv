2020-12-30 00:55:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/kmwc8e/experienced_meth_users_and_recovering_addicts/,Experienced meth users and recovering addicts: What are the differences between an addiction to smoking meth vs. an addiction to taking meth pills?,"I know that the speed, intensity, and lengths of the highs are different. But what I'm really asking is:

**If I am addicted to taking meth pills... will my journey to recovery (and my experiences of withdrawal, cravings, relapse, etc.) look basically the same as that of a person recovering from an addiction to smoking crystal meth?** 

**Are the pills an ""easier"" addiction to overcome in any way?**

Finding the answer to this question is unfortunately very relevant to my current situation, and somewhat urgent.

I've always told myself that heroin and meth are two things I would never use in my life, ever. I've known friends and family members whose lives these drugs have ruined. I keep a healthy distance from anyone I come across who is a regular user of meth or heroin.

Unfortunately, in the past few years, I've developed an addiction to amphetamine medications-- particularly Adderall. I know how similar these medications are to meth-- and that made me even *more* intent on staying away from meth. Because I knew if I liked the Adderall high this much, then I would almost certainly be hooked by a meth high.

I haven't really taken my addiction to Adderall all that seriously, or had any strong urge to quit using. Until these past couple days.

So why am I talking about Adderall when the question was about meth?

**Long story short:** a few days ago I discovered that the ""Adderall"" pills I've been buying (on and off) for nearly 2 years now-- the pills I'm addicted to-- are actually pressed meth-based pills disguised as Adderall.

So I've suddenly discovered *I'm a meth addict.*

My mind is still processing this fact. I haven't told anyone yet. This feels like the biggest fuck-up I've ever made. I feel like my entire fucking world is collapsing around me right now, and I'm seeing my identity and my life with a brutal new clarity. I'm terrified, I feel alone and helpless, and I'm desperately looking for advice and support.

I'm ready to quit. I'm ready for recovery. But I have no clue what steps to take first. I have no idea what this path looks like, or how difficult it will be. So I'm here looking for answers.

Are these two types of meth addiction (smoking vs pills) basically one and the same?

Or am I overreacting? I've successfully overcome addictions before (to weed and to kratom), so do I have a good chance of smoothly sailing out of this one? (Obviously meth is a different beast entirely than weed or kratom...)

I'm just scared. And I want to have some idea of what this next chapter of my life is going to look like.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.78226894}"

This morning, after staying up all night crying, feeling the room spin and jittering out of my skin, I took my fifth Ritalin 20mg LA in the span of 10 hours, and it finally clicked that I've been abusing my prescription for the past year not just because of addiction, but also as a means of self-harm. (I used to cut myself years ago, but that was just plain awkward when other people noticed--prescription drugs are way easier to hide, plus you get to lie to yourself about using them to get smarter! Yaaaayyy!/s Ugh). 

I do have ADHD (PI) and my first couple of months on Ritalin were perfect. Then... yeah. Addiction. I blame several things for this, all of which boil down to me.

First, two months into my very diligent use, I got the bright idea to have a few drinks while on Ritalin. I'd never had any struggles with alcohol beyond just occasional one-night binges. With Ritalin, though, I started consuming it damn near daily, and regularly drinking past the point of blacking out/completely losing my memory--something I'd never done before. (One night I did this with the sole intent of working on a very delicate, unique drawing I was very excited to finish. I blacked out, totally unaware that I had both finished an entire bottle of vodka and consumed my entire Ritalin LA prescription for the rest of the month, *at least* 300mg worth. I have zero memory of doing so, zero memory of that whole evening. I had apparently sat quietly on the floor by myself for 9 hours doing nothing but incoherently scribbling all over my beautiful drawing. I've done my fair share of shitty MDMA and I can tell you that even the worst comedown from that paled in comparison to what I experienced that morning. I also had extremely vivid, highly complex, microscopically detailed hallucinations for two hours as I laid in bed coming down from that misery). 

Second, I've struggled with eating disorders and used Ritalin even when I didn't need it that day just so I didn't have to eat. Yeah I lost weight. Yeah it came back. Yeah I'm an idiot and deliberately exceeded my dose on some days when the appetite suppression wore off. 

Third, none of the psychs I consulted told me that the euphoria effect actually wears off after a period of regular use. I thought that was how it was supposed to feel, and steadily I started increasing my dose as it felt like it ""stopped working"". (This is my fault, ultimately, because I should have done my research much earlier, and I should have controlled my impulses, obviously). 

Fourth, because it worked so miraculously at first, I quickly formed an overreliance on it and failed to use it as intended, i.e. holistically in conjunction with a schedule, routine, good diet, exercise, etc. I fell so in love with the feeling of being able to FOCUS for the first time and SOCIALISE with ease for the first time that I barely even noticed when I started using that focus to ignore my loved ones in order to spend hours researching pointless things. 

Fifth, my prescription would run out sooner every month, but each month's withdrawal period felt much better than the last, so I told myself ""Well, I'm clearly coping very well with each withdrawal, so of course that means it's totally fine if I keep up this binge-withdrawal cycle indefinitely!"" Every month I'd start liking Ritalin a little less, and feeling much better and more productive during the sober weeks. Ive gotten to the point where it's obvious that I straight-up feel like utter shite and do absolutely nothing useful, not even clean my house, during the week or two I binge Ritalin, and feel remarkably human, clear-headed, capable, disciplined and optimistic when I am going through withdrawal. This month, I filled my script (for thirty 10mg XRs and thirty 20mg LAs) on the 17th of December. I have one pill remaining. It is the 29th of December. I have done nothing with my time. I desperately want to take the last pill. 


At this point in my addiction, binging means I very frequently forget to take my SSRI and mood stabilizer. This means I take more Ritalin. It also means I'm more apathetic and hollow than I've ever been in my life. It means I don't even give a shit about feeling hollow. And that makes it easier for me to consider killing myself. I stopped caring about the humanitarian and environmental issues I was so passionate about. My wide interests and thirst for learning have dissolved. I never make art anymore. I never leave my house. I've been living in filth more often than not. Now my best friend and partner of 7 years has broken up with me because its so clear I need to heal. I don't know if I can. I have nothing left to live for. I don't even care. I want to die, and I've found myself researching suicide methods again. I'm not depressed. I'm just profoundly disappointed in myself. 

Yeah. Well. Guess this is what I've spent my last few Ritalins on. Sorry for the ramble.",33,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5987315}"

I basically put a lot of extra unnecessary stress on myself at a time where I would be already facing a lot of stress due to family in town and their expectations of me during our time together.

I explained my situation to them and how I wouldn’t be at my best. They haven’t really cut me any slack. 

I would’ve been a lot better off flushing my pills in another week or so. And my family wouldn’t be as irritated with me as they are. I’ve been abusing my pills for years but it’s always been consistent. It’s not like another month of that would’ve been all that bad in the grand scheme of things (assuming I still had the desire to flush my pills next month, or just not fill my script)

I'm kinda looking to be talked out of it, in all honesty. But I am considering starting adderall (15mg) again tomorrow as I've felt super  lethargic and brain foggy these past couple of weeks I have been off of adderall. I have been taking adderall on and off for around 2 years, always been legally prescribed and I never took more than my dosage for the day (15mg, which is pretty low), no abuse in my past.

I can barely function without adderall, and I am tired literally all the time. I suspect I have [ADHD-PI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_predominantly_inattentive), but it has never been officially diagnosed. So maybe I just need adderall daily while taking a week or two off every once in a while (tolerance builds up quickly then it just stops working). I don't seem to get any side effects from adderall, nothing too noticeable anyways. I thought it was keeping me awake all night and making me clench my jaw, but in this past two weeks when I haven't been taking any adderall, I have continued to stay up all night and experience jaw pain. So maybe the adderall had less to do with those things after all.

The case against it is I'd rather not be on any daily medication, and I worry specifically about long-term adderall usage, but maybe it's just something I need. Also tolerance builds up quickly and having to take breaks often is difficult, a bit of a roller coaster. It's possible my brain is still adjusting to have no adderall? The brain takes a while to re-wire, but 2 weeks off seems like I should be starting to feel slightly back to normal now, and I am not getting any sense of that.

**edit: I did end up going back on adderall for a few days, hoping I would feel a bit more 'normal', but it didn't help at all. Just thought I'd post this update/note in case anyone else found this thread and was tempted to go back to stimulants. I was off for 15 or 16 days, then decided to try and get back on again, and just didn't get any boost at all...so why take them if they aren't even helping.

This time of year can be tough for those of us in recovery, especially in this crazy year - whether it be because we’re more alone than usual, can’t see family, or because we _have_ to spend time with family, or even because we’re having a great time, and our brains say “hey, why not make yourself _even_ happier by doing some drugs??” 

But just remember if you’re struggling with your recovery over the holiday period: deciding to use might make things feel better for a tiny weeny amount of time, but then tomorrow or in a few hours, you’re on a comedown or just back to the baseline you were trying to avoid AND you’ve broken your clean streak.

My brain fog has been so bad this year, due to more than one issue I think. I stopped taking adderall a couple of weeks ago because tolerance built up and I was just getting no benefit whatsoever.

I am in a weird daze 24/7 and my cognitive tempo is so slow and I am starting to become forgetful and...well, my brain seems fried is the best way of putting it I guess.  I never feel awake or present. Any supplements that are recommended post-adderall?

Supplements never seem to do anything at all for me, but willing to give it a shot if I need to replace my possibly dopamine depleted brain (not sure if that's accurate).

I am always energetic and happy, I don't have depression and I am passionate about life.

**I've known for a long time that I need to quit abusing adderall (and alcohol) and to admit to my beloved mother that I had frequently stolen her pills from freshman to junior year. I always wanted to tell her in a way that wouldn't make her feel at fault.** Especially with this brief history: when I confessed alcohol theft and abuse in 9th grade, she admitted to feeling like a ""bad parent"" for not addressing it sooner due to denial,  despite recognizing signs shared with my formerly alcoholic father, and even smelling booze on me while I cried to her. (I must note she is an amazing mother for a plethora of reasons, and I can understand this as it was a very difficult time for her as a single working mother of two with extremely tight finances, AND still freshly recovering from a 2nd *horrible* marriage.) **I thought I should tell a professional first to approach it in the best way, but never did because I was afraid of the mark it could leave on my file.** Like being denied much needed painkillers for surgery in a few decades. **I also didn't want to lose the drug. I hadn't had my fill yet, nor hit anything like the ""rock bottom"" that's supposed to be your queue to stop.** Only many nasty comedowns and the warnings in the back of my head. Even when I lost my virginity to date rape by my alc plug I didn't consider quitting just yet. It was my coping mechanism throughout 4 high schools.


**Predictably, I kept telling myself that I would quit or take my next refill as prescribed. Never worked, you know the story.**


I graduated High School June of 2020, planning to take a gap year to get my act together and apply to colleges. I will say that **my mental health tremendously improved since leaving highschool behind.** Even the adderall habits improved for a few months. But I guess since september when my friends went back to school and stopped being the center of my schedule, things have been turning around for the worse.  **I started having crippling anxiety, sadness, and mood swings as more time went on without applying to schools, but the tipping point seemed to be when I actually started.**  Deadline January 1st. New script. Good lord. I've taken 4 on the first day. Getting work done. Cool cool cool. Good lord I will be useless tomorrow. Sleep. Okay this is great oh nope nope nope good lord pain. Btw still having daily episodes of just horrible sobbing that come unpredictably.


**I requested college letters from my teacher and counselor last week. Two nights ago when I was too chemically and emotionally fricked to answer a questionnaire for the letters**, (which was already egregiously late and I knew I couldn't do it even over my entirely free weekend.) **I did some critical thinking, sobbing and weighed my options knowing that it was time to get help. I believe the best decision is to postpone the college search, come clean to my family, and devote my time and energy to creating a healthy and sober life.**


So yeah. It's been a day since I decided. I haven't told anybody yet. Not even my teacher and counselor who still believe I'm applying on the 1st. I'm mostly just venting and trying to work through this, to wrap my head around the situation as objectively as I can so I can tell everybody that I need to tell in the best way that I can, and soon.

I just wanted to check in and remind you a couple of things. 

1.) You are important. Yes, you. Important. Here's the kicker, you're not terminally unique. Sober or not, you're not uniquely suffering. For so long I was stuck in this thought trap, taking enough vyvanse to wake up a city. I thought that even in the lows, I was somehow STILL smarter, better, faster, could outthink anyone. This made me think that my problem was unique, that somehow my addiction was ""special"" and nobody could fix me. 

2.) You are useful without stims. After chasing the higher state of consciousness for so long, you probably started to associate your self worth with your productivity. Maybe you wouldn't have that degree without stims. Maybe you wouldn't have been able to deep clean your house without stims, maybe they made you more social, talkative.. Don't fall for it.. no matter what it feels like, you can do great and amazing things without the drugs. It doesn't feel as good during, but damnit it's possible. Quit believing you can't do shit without them. You can, and you will. 

3.) You don't NEED them. I get it, it feels like you do.. especially if you've been in the routine for so long. At this point, you may have even started to accept the thought that you will want them the rest of your life. Your mind has convinced you of this... why wouldn't it? Shit feels good. Don't be a bitch. Give yourself a chance. Put them down and let the natural joy and rhythm of life come back. It takes a while... it takes a long fucking time but holy shit life can be SO MUCH BETTER than constantly reaching for those stupid fucking pills. Someday you will look back at how far you have come and wonder what you were thinking.

I loved how it made me feel sharp, lucid, confident, and focused. I never felt 'tweaked' I just felt- good. I never had the desire to buy my own bag back then, just would take a line or two when offered. Then about a year and a half ago I started thinking about the feeling, how great it felt and how I was going through depression and trying to lose weight and considered how it might help level me out. I started to even dream about doing it and how it felt in the dream.

I know this is where a normal person would go seek out therapy or some sort of medication to try to deal with the mental health issues. I, however, am not a normal person. It's always been sort of looked down on by my family and implied by my partner to not want to see me get medicated. Besides all that I don't have health insurance but make too much to get any social assistance. So what I decided to do was just to start buying a little bit here and there to get me over any kind of slump I was in, and I completely hid it from my partner who would not at all approve of me doing cocaine. 

I started using a tiny tiny bit before work and on lunch, like a rice grain bump here and there. First I was buying a half a gram every two weeks, then I started doing it every day. Then the lines got bigger, and I started seeking out purer coke. 

Gradually it got to the point that any spare second I had to myself I was sneaking off to do a line. Especially if I was drinking. I had made a little covert drug kit that had everything in it to be really low key. I let only a few people I knew already did coke know that I did. Even then I hardly ever did it with other people as to keep the risk down of my partner finding out. I knew what behaviors, posture, facial expressions, body language that being on coke made me feel and I would consciously practice not doing them. I also masked the high with more and more drinking, and encouraging him to drink, which I feel guilty about. The drinking fueled the desire to do more coke, and the coke more drinking. I am a woman, and I was easily putting away 8-10 beers a night on average. I would wake up in the morning sick and still drunk, pound some coffee, and do another line.

All I ever wanted to do was do my drugs, drink, and be alone by myself to write or read or do music. I felt guilty but I felt when I could be by myself high at least I could pretend I wasn't hurting myself or others. 

I don't know if he knew this whole time or if he's just thinking I'm going through some shit- but I have never admitted it to my partner, and I don't intend to. I never spent any of his money- I never cheated or did anything shady or bad- I just secretly was getting blasted out of my gourd every day and feeling like a huge piece of shit because of it. I feel like if I tell him, it will just cause him to think WHAT ELSE could she possibly be hiding from me and he will never trust me again and I will lose his heart. He is the love of my life and I can not risk it. 

I am just stuck with these questions: Why can't I just suck it up and deal with life without having to be on something? Why can't I just fight hard enough? Why do I not feel deserving of my own happiness?

Who convinced me that I am not worthy of my own happiness?

How can I look inside the mirror and see

someone I love?

&#x200B;

How can I claim to be giving all the love I have

when I am not giving it to myself in the first place?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It's been 5 days since I last took cocaine. I can't imagine doing it again. It feels dirty, it feels wrong. I don't want it. I am sure there are going to be times when it sounds like the best idea ever just to pick up another bag. When that day comes I will come back to this and read it again and remember how resolute I felt when I wrote this.

This is just my take on it, I know there is no one answer for everyone and we are all our own person the same exact experience can happen to two people and it can affect them in very different ways, Depending on where they were raised, if life was hard or life was easy, did they struggle growing up, see things most people shouldn't or had things done to them no one should ever have to deal with all these things have to be taken into account, because in life its usually the bad things the define us not so much the good times [https://youtu.be/iLSedCjdOXA](https://youtu.be/iLSedCjdOXA) let me know if you'd like to know about how bad I was when I was using heavily so you guys don't think I was talking out of my ass, it wouldn't be a video bragging, in fact I'm quite disappointed in the person i used to be but if you feel like it would make you believe in me or have more faith in my words, I'll gladly take my mind back to those days.

We can have private calls for those who cant afford counseling and I'm not saying, I'll counsel you cause I don't have a degree for that but I will listen and do my best to teach you coping strategy's I learned in counseling.

AMA,"I was prescribed Adderall/Vyvanse for 15 years. Mostly Adderall. I took it regularly for about 13 years. For the last 2 years I was taking *at least* 60 mg a day. I’ve been off it for 275 days. I quit cold turkey because I was incapable of doing it any other way. 

Once I crossed the line into abuse, it became impossible to go back to responsible use. Even now, knowing how fucking fantastic I feel off Adderall, there’s no doubt in my mind that I would take it if I had it. I also feel this probably expands to other pills, so I’ve come to accept that I now have strong addictive tendencies. Just accepting this fact has been really helpful in my day-to-day life.

If you want to know why I quit, I don’t think my story is much different than others but AMA! I was a highly functional addict, but life sucked and I eventually wanted better for myself. Here’s my experience quitting and some tips: 

-  You CAN quit! I read this sub a lot in my lead-up to quitting, but I never actually believed any of the posts claiming successful recovery. I always told myself, “Well clearly they didn’t NEED Adderall, unlike me. I need it! It’s a medicine! From a doctor!” 

-  The first two months sucked hard. I wish I could tell you otherwise. If possible, I recommend planning at least a week to do nothing but eat and sleep.

-  The sleep the first week is so good! Enjoy it. I slept like 16 (GLORIOUS) hours a day, so definitely factor this into your schedule. 

-  But for real: you will be tired as shit for a long time. I’m sorry! This is what stopped me from quitting in the past. I’d “quit” and feel fatigue and brain fog and no motivation, and I would use this to justify my prescription for stimulants. Every. Time. I didn’t know until this sub that I was likely experiencing PAWS. THE FATIGUE WILL GO AWAY. It took me until about month 4 to feel less tired (I know, so fucking long! Stick with it!).  

- Weight. This was also a reason I resisted quitting. I gained about 10 pounds after quitting. I am (now) fine with this extra weight because not feeling like a soulless empty zombie IS WORTH IT, I PROMISE. I ate food like a crazy person the first 2 weeks, but this eventually fizzled out. 

- I look better. My skin is way more hydrated and I look like less of a psychopathic vampire. Also, I think the amount of Adderall I was taking was causing me to breakout? 

- The compulsion to ALWAYS BE DOING SOMETHING is gone. This is the best part. 

- Related: I think it’s important to accept that you will no longer be a workaholic machine. You will no longer be able to work 10 hours without eating, and you will no longer excitedly and unnecessarily color code all the office files like a deranged Monica Geller. To my ADHD brethren: people will no longer believe you are super organized. Embrace it. Fuck that soulless workaholic shit. Personally, I really enjoy not spending my downtime reorganizing my linen cabinet for the millionth time for no fucking reason at all. 

Some other tips:

- Tell people. After I told my husband and best friend that I had developed an addiction and needed to quit, there was no going back. Accountability (or even just the prospect of it) really helps. Also? People will like the new you a lot more than the Adderall you. Oh, you went down a rabbit hole and can now regale the party with incredibly detailed facts about North Korean prison camps or the mating habits of some random insect? Great, NOBODY WANTS THIS. You will be WAY more fun off Adderall. Remember laughing?

- Buy a shitload of vitamins. I had developed such a connection to taking a pill = feeling better that I needed something to replace the physical action of taking adderall during those first few weeks. Sadly, I *needed* to take a pill every couple of hours. So I just spread vitamins out throughout the day and took them whenever I felt the compulsion. (Yup, Adderall slowly turned me into a giant pill head.)

- Medication. I began taking Lexapro a couple months before I quit, mostly to combat the anxiety that came from...Adderall. I started Wellbutrin a few weeks after quitting to help with the fatigue/brain fog from withdrawal. It worked, and I think it’s been better for my ADHD than anything else. I don’t *feel* it working and yet I feel like a normal person. I don’t think I would be where I am today without bupropion and I will continue to take it. I am currently phasing Lexapro out because it felt a bit redundant.

- Rewards! I gave my self little rewards whenever I hit a milestone (30 days, 60 days, etc). I’d increase the size of the reward each time as well, giving myself something to look forward to. I’ve been buying myself jewelry :). 

- Self acceptance. It’s fucked up that I was prescribed a pill just because I was terrible at spreadsheets and late to everything and not really into America’s crazy workaholic culture. A big reason I’ve been successful is that I’ve finally decided to just accept my ADHD related...quirks. 

TLDR: Adderall is a delicious poison, but quitting is SO FUCKING WORTH IT.

Mental and Physical.,"I have been sober for 1 year almost 4 months from methamphetamine use. I did the drug for less than a year but I still got left with some lasting damage. I grind my teeth now and it’s not so bad like it was in the beginning of me quitting but it’s still there. Another thing I got left with is not being focused. I’ve never been too focused of a person but I used to be able to sit and watch a movie/tv show without switching to something else. I feel like only I can see the difference in myself but then I have somebody tell me how they also can see that I’m not exactly the same person that I used to be. I’ve never been a perfect person because let’s face it, nobody’s perfect. Still though that was the person I was and I feel like meth changed a few things about me. 

I get scared now of the dark, I try not to be but I also don’t like when it’s super quiet so I always have to have something on in the background and I usually leave my tv on because I don’t like to sleep in the dark but sometimes I will. Another thing is that I always feel like something is after me even though I know it’s just a mental thing I still hate the feeling. I never used to feel or think anything like that until after I started using.

For my physical effects I already mentioned the grinding of my teeth. The second thing is that my skin is way more sensitive than it used to be. On my body and my face. I used to never break out hardly ever. I do now. My skin is still decent but it was perfect before. I could fall asleep with makeup on and not wake up with any breakouts and to me that was awesome. Not the case anymore. Anyways, I just want to say don’t do drugs if you love and value yourself. Even if you don’t feel happy with yourself, please don’t use drugs as a way to feel better or happier because that won’t fix anything on how you feel about yourself. It could possibly make things worse. I didn’t love myself for a while and I’ve only recently started to learn to love myself and take care of myself. Be strong and if you’re sad try to find healthier ways to cope. This is to anybody struggling with addiction or depression or both.

When I'm using I tell myself if I really loved him more than my addiction I would get control of it on my own.

I need to be accountable - I can never do it alone.

Let’s do this.,"Immediately afterwards, I called my  psychiatrist. Lovely guy that I have been  bamboozling for Adderall. Told him that I was quitting and to cancel all future appointments. 

I was described Adderall in high school, yet like most of us here, I developed a propensity to abuse it, so I started getting prescriptions only when I was in a particularly nasty funk since I would go HAM and basically succumb myself to a state of perpetual emotional turbulence so I could study up on a bunch of stupid shit that I wouldn’t enjoy sober. Honestly, I don’t think I even have ADHD, the whole thing was basically diagnosed incredibly haphazardly because I had subpar grades. 

I started  taking it again about four months ago, and though it helps me get out of bed  and do what I have to do, I  also suffer  from awful depression and it may just be attributable to that, so I went to  another psychiatrist and  convinced him to prescribe  me  Wellbutrin. I left my Wellbutrin on standby as I blew through a one-month Adderall prescription in two weeks, and after  a  few days, I started taking the Wellbutrin for the other two weeks. Holy shit, it was incredible. I felt like myself again. Yet once I got my one-month Adderall refill again, I stopped taking the Wellbutrin and went back to my Adderall binges. Except the bupropion takes much longer to leave my body than one day, so I was struck with the absolute WORST pants-shitting suicidal roller coaster anxiety I have ever felt on top of completely neutralizing the focusing effect of adderall. Jesus. And yet I couldn’t stop myself from taking more adderall; my justification being that I’m in a funk and need Adderall to get myself out of it. But Wellbutrin WAS helping me focus and I stopped taking it in lieu of adderall. The difference is that Adderall helps me focus on anything - and that includes things that I would normally find unbearable. And if I need to take a drug in order to force myself to “enjoy” something, that’s not a path I should be taking in the first place and should reevaluate until I decide to spend my time on things that are actually fulfilling. 

This is probably the anxiety speaking, but I’m a bit worried about the leftover cardiovascular effects of taking Adderall while bupropion remained on my system, so I’m going to buy a blood pressure monitor and wait a few more days before going back on the Wellbutrin. I was doing SO well on Wellbutrin; working out, eating clean, feeling confident and outgoing and I gave up on all that just so I could continue experiencing the headrush of Adderall and bury my head  in shitty, pedantic books for 10 hours a day  even if it meant unbearable, alienating anxiety and crushing self-loathing. I’m fucking done. This makes no sense. Goodbye you batshit crazy ass drug. This is no way to live.",83,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.67265207}"
2020-12-14 09:40:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/kcyu47/i_cant_find_one_reason_to_quit_using_adderall/,I can't find one reason to quit using Adderall.,"A life without stimulants is one that I have no desire living. I'm the absolute and utter best version of myself on them! Before I started using Adderall, I was a lazy fucking bum. There's no way to sugar coat it. I sit around all day and I don't do a damn thing except go get high with my group! A loser. I got into a good college because I was just one of those kids that didn't really need to try to do well in high school to do well, and not only that but I got accepted and turned down offers to much better colleges just because they were far from home! I was close to valedictorian in a very good high school, and I looked around at all of these ambitious people surrounding me going out of their way to make a difference and to leave their mark, and here I was looking over notes before tests and acing them, making my parents proud. Little did I know how much that would bite me in the ass once reality made its way into my little pea brain who knew how to do math well and write a few ""breathtaking"" papers to clueless teachers that that doesn't last out in the real world. My parents were under the impression that I was some fucking 40 hours studying a week high school student, oh little did they know. I had no ambition, I had a good memory and a way with wooing dumbass teachers into thinking there was some deep metaphorical meaning to all of my papers (Dear high school students, trust me you can do it too, regardless of your school intelligence which by the way means absolutely nothing). And what I'm about to say isn't meant to be some type of arrogant or cocky statement, but Jesus I did really shit away what I know could have been a brilliant mind. You have to put some fucking EFFORT in. And this is how it began. My first long college paper due date's here. Not a fucking word was written on this paper. 12 hours away. I'd heard some interesting stuff about Adderall from people and took the first (hard) stimulant of my life. It was life changing. I wrote a 12 page paper before half the time it had even worn off. Not only that, but it was the most insanely detailed and genuinely interesting paper I had ever written in my life on a PHYSICS CONCEPT. I was amazed. I thought about what else I could do with this magic ""limitless"" pill that it truly is (I know the film Limitless is about Modafinil, but Adderall is far superior in my opinion). I saved up money to buy one of my friends' whole prescription. It was the best thing that ever happened to me. I used this new artificial drive to find new ambitions in my life. Making money became an obsession. I spent 16 hour sessions studying the game of poker until I finally started to consistently make money at small stakes. This is when shit went downhill. I started using that money to  sell drugs (LSD, MDMA, Shrooms, Xanax, Oxycodone, cocaine and much more, but boy I would not dare sell my addies... Those were MINE) to frat boys and market them like fucking Purdue Pharma all around the dorm. With the combination of poker money, drug money, a great social life, and absolutely fucking tearing my classes apart with a consistent 3.9 GPA. Life could not have been better. But a problem arises when you are doing financially well for a college student and have an endless amount of the drug you're addicted to around you. The dosages skyrocketed, but my production didn't, but what became noticeable was how as time went on these comedowns were becoming absolute hell. And that was the moment I noticed, that this is not a sustainable way of living. I stopped selling drugs because of some threats, safety concerns etc... But holy fucking shit do I have a lot on my plate right now, and I don't even know if I could take one day off without it falling all apart. To give a brief summary of my everyday routine, set an alarm for 6:30, pop a 25 mg XR, and go back to sleep. 30 minutes later I wake up ready to take on the day, and when I'm officially out of bed in the morning, I pop one more. I get online and play poker for about 4 hours. Poker is poker, some days are good some days are bad, but overall I make a pretty good money off of playing multiple tables of $5/$10 blinds (This is essentially my job atm, it pays fairly well). Then when my poker alarm goes off, I study for about 8+ hours straight. Non. Stop. Once all of that is over if it is a weekend I go out and party, if not I gamble on a video game that I am very competitive in for the rest of the day. One could say I'm a gambling addict, but I'm going to dismiss that considering that I'm up thousands and thousands of dollars in my junior year of college. And there's only one problem. If I stop taking that god damn pill. I'm a day away from the ambitious and driven life I've created for myself, to complete and utter meaningless, on top of that disappointment and confusion from my family who have looked up to me as the one who's made it for myself. The life I've built, all of the success I've made for myself, the amazing relationships I've formed, it isn't real. It's all from a pill that someone like me doesn't deserve. And if any of you read this and use think that you wanna go back to the stims, because you're reminiscing on the good times, of course you would, why the fuck wouldn't you? Please... don't. It's fake. It's all fake. It's an artificial utopia I've formed around myself if you've been there and kicked it... You are a strong individual, much stronger than I could ever see myself being. If you made it to the end thank you. It's 9 A.M. and I have 75mg of amphetamine salts running through my veins. Everything's right, except for the fact that my own glorious life I've created for myself can come crumbling down like a house of cards with one healthy decision. And it's not one I'm ready to make. I know this is going to sound absolutely brainless, but the effects on my health are the least of my concerns. I need a life change. A habit change. I'm positive someone is out there like me that made it, and I just need a success story, one that will make me realize I can live a live this full of ambition, this full of drive, and with this level of ass kicking without this god forsaken motherfucking pill. How is it possible? This is a cry for help, regardless of the artificially produced happiness I feel while typing these words out to whoever is listening.

TD;LR: I'm a heavy user and abuser of stimulants, especially ADHD meds, Adderall mainly, and I can't kick it because it has made me a successful and ambitious person. And I can't find a reason to quit regardless of the obvious truth, that stimulant addiction is an unhealthy, and unsustainable habit.",17,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5203036}"
2020-12-14 02:40:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/kct86m/first_weekend_sober_in_7_years/,First weekend sober in 7 years,"This weekend felt so bizarre. It’s the first time I haven’t done coke in nearly 2 years and the first time I’ve been completely sober in 7. And it was a celebratory weekend too. I got a promotion at my job and a huge salary increase. Any other weekend I would’ve called all my friends to come to the bar, picked up a ball and I would have spent 2 days staying up until 7 am feeling great about myself. 

But on Tuesday of the prior week, I woke up to what felt like a heart attack at only age 25. My doctor still doesn’t know what’s wrong with me. They gave me meds to try to help lower my heart rate, but it’s still around 95 bpm resting and 130 when I’m simply moving about. My normal heart rate is around 65. I have a meeting with a cardiologist this week and I think I finally have to come clean about my addiction. Any advice here?

Even with all this and being grumpy and sad as hell... I’m so proud of myself for staying sober this weekend. I didn’t even drink. It’s a baby step... but it’s a step nonetheless. I can never go back to coke after this health scare. I feel like an idiot for putting myself in this position, but I’m trying to be optimistic about what the future has in store. I really can’t believe how easy it was to become addicted and not bat an eye. I checked my bank transactions and realized that I’ve spent nearly $9,000 on my “habit”. It’s insane how easy it is to excuse when the irs normalized by the people you hang out with (both industry folks and corporate people).

I’m over six months clean from Vyvanse abuse now, and even though I feel awful at the moment, on the third day of a rough PAWS patch, I’m trying to remind myself that I have seen signs of improvement recently.

But that’s how bad PAWS can be: I can have ten days of unambiguous improvement, feeling my feelings, getting things done, becoming more hopeful, and then a single bad day of PAWS--let alone three--can cast doubt upon all my progress and upon any hope that I’ll ever feel normal again.

When I force calm upon my thoughts, I know that having nasty symptoms six months into recovery is entirely normal and no real indicator of my recovery prognosis--in just another few months I might feel awesome--but I still have a hard time really believing that reasoning. When the symptoms act up, I lose all hope so fast.

Fucking up your brain chemistry really puts typical feelings in a new perspective. Hope, for instance, must be some expectation (an idea) plus a positive feeling associated with that expectation. Without the positive feeling, the expectation means nothing and hope becomes impossible.

I want to articulate a few of the feelings because a) writing it out is slightly soothing, b) I hope one day to recover and to be able to show future sufferers what depths they can recover from, and c) I need to scare myself into never ending up like this again.

1. How I can be so tired yet so unable to sleep is unfathomable to me. I have slept only a few hours for each of the past nights, but if I try to sleep when I’m anything less than absolutely exhausted, my body throws itself into a panic for no clear reason.

2. The anhedonia is unbearable. Formerly enjoyable activities leave me numb, while the smallest tasks overdraw my motivation account. My brain seems to have the impression that food will get the neurochemicals flowing, but it never does, so instead I stew in guilt for overeating. I fear my boyfriend would feel betrayed if he knew just how incapable I am of feeling the joy and affection he used to inspire in me. I still love him, I’m certain, which tells me that the roots of love are deeper than mere feeling, but on days like today the glow is gone.

3. The mechanisms for feeling negative emotions, on the other hand, are mostly intact: shame not just for the drug abuse but for all the fucked-up things about me that drove me to it; regret because I know I once had everything I needed to live a good life but was ungrateful and therefore squandered it all in a selfish attempt to take more than my share; and a pale unpoetic depression that refuses even to be elevated into a more exciting emotion like rage or devastation. In fewer words, this shit sucks and sucks *boringly*.

This wasn’t a pleasant read, I’m sure, nor was it meant to be. But it is healthy for us to process our feelings, I think, and I mean it when I say I hope this post has future value. I hope one day that some sufferer early in the recovery process will find it, see how bad things were, then visit my profile page, and see that everything turned out okay eventually.",17,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6978104}"
2020-12-13 04:05:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/kc7juu/i_think_im_about_to_quit_adderall_its_awful/,I think I’m about to quit adderall. It’s awful timing but I don’t think I have a choice.,"UPDATE:  IT HAPPENED

For 7 years I’ve been proscribed anywhere between 20mg to 60mg. I know a lot of good and bad has come from it. 🤷🏼‍♂️

Unfortunately, over time either the addictive nature of it and/or the side effects lead me to abuse it regularly. I haven’t been able to make my script last the entire month since, idk, maybe 2016? I usually run out after 3 weeks, sometimes 2. I bought a Ksafe and told myself if I break it open, that is it. Well I broke it open in November, replaced the bottom, but since getting my refill the other day, I haven’t even been using it...

It’s always been the most difficult time to avoid abusing on day 1 of my refill. I’m almost always awake for 2 days after. I used to tell my ex “Christmas is on Thursday...” meaning my refill was due. What a concerning thought that was... that I shrugged off...

But yeah, refill day is like “damn! I have so much! I can for sure at least take some of that extra 2 days worth I get (since I inevitably refill every 28 days but am prescribed for 30). The next day I am still awake and think, “well since i abused already I better abuse just a little so there isn’t a dramatic jump back to my prescribed dose. Then I may take it as prescribed some days or maybe up to double my dose... either way at some point I start to “notice” how the pill bottle isn’t bottomless anymore. I count up what I have and if I have enough to take at least something each day until refill, I map it out for that. Of course I’m unable to do that 99% of the time but it does help. Then, after the break period... repeat! I tell myself, next time will be different! It never is. (Edit: I suppose i took it mostly as prescribed when I was working full time; not so much when unemployed or self-employed) 

Now I will say, last month was interesting. My doctor accidentally wrote only half the XR I normally get. I filled it and didn’t notice until there were just 10 XR pills left. After counting, stunned and questioning my own sanity briefly, I angrily and accurately shouted “THATS NOT TRUE!!!” I normally get 60 a month but this time only 30. I realized the mistake once I read the bottle. My doc screwed up, and wrote once daily instead of twice. She ordered 30 more pills that I could pick up at the half way point. Which, was nice! Since I had all my XR remaining at 15 days (I had used up all 30 IR pills just so I could “get to” the half way point..) from that point I was more regular with my dosing and pretty much “made it” through the month, more so than normal. I wish I could pick up my script weekly. That might have prevented some of the abuse. 

Abuse aside..  there are plenty of other very enticing reasons why I should quit. 

-After running out of pills and having to wait 2 weeks for a refill, I’ve noticed the most genuine laugh would come out of me from watching comedy. This alone is something I am very much looking forward to, and it should only take a week or two!

-No guilt. No random strange hard to pin down side effects. No denial. No more deliberate all nighters. No more getting “stuck” doing something, ignoring the voice in my head to stand up and take a break. No more constant battle to stay hydrated. No more ability to drink alcohol beyond what I should be capable of, and function somewhat normally (I will actually miss this lol but obviously this will be better for my body) No more stim dick 


I do however have some SERIOUS CONCERNS for what might go wrong once I quit. I’ve never gone more than 1-2 weeks without it, so this will be new to me...  I figure, in the event my life somehow gets dramatically worse, I can always consider talking to my psychiatrist about drug alternatives. I don’t plan to even consider this for another 6-12 months from now. 

When I’ve run out, I’ve noticed this pattern where I end up buying a bunch of candy/junk good and more or less binge. My oral habits fall apart too. I’ve always struggled with brushing but the past 6 months I’ve actually managed to stay rather consistent with nightly flossing and brushing. I’m at a point now where it would be possibly devastating to my oral health if this good habit disappeared 😬 also I drink more in an effort to make the days end more “exciting/eventful”

A year ago I quit smoking weed. I was a regular pot smoker for maybe 9 years. I don’t want to resume weed but really it would be better health wise to consider weed my “event” and cut out alcohol. I was actually disappointed with quitting weed. I can’t say I felt all that much different after quitting for a year but maybe I would notice if I started again. 

Also, I’m just now trying to date again. (My ex left me just over a year ago). Might not seem like it, but in many ways got my act together this year and followed through on things I had been putting off for years.  (I suppose quitting adderall is also one of those things) But I’m currently talking with two people and I plan to casually date right after the holidays. I’m worried now because it’s obviously not a good idea to be recovering from this kind of thing right as im forming potential relationships. I wish I had decided to quit months ago and the timing would be less of any issue ... They will probably think I’m suddenly depressed (compared to the energy I had in texts and on the phone). This is my biggest concern with quitting right now. 😞 If I quit tomorrow I would probably meet them around week 3-4 of recovery. I definitely feel more energy and functional by the end of week 1 and 2, still— this timing sucks! I don’t want to risk losing a chance to connect with either of them. Realistically I shouldn’t even consider a relationship until maybe the summer at the earliest, given the recovery. 

Luckily, I am currently unemployed 😂 Theres no risk of losing a job or say my grades declining. 

I’m thinking I may flush my pills tomorrow. I keep justifying a reason to keep them or give them to someone “just in case” but I shouldn’t listen to that thought. I’ve done this before (through week 2) and I feel I can rise to most any occasion coming up in the near future, including Christmas time (20th-new years)spent with my siblings/family. 

EDIT:Lastly: I just want to say, I’ve had near perfect “good days” on adderall. Maybe even with more than prescribed. So I’m convinced my issues with adderall are more or less caused by side effects of the adderall. For example on day 1 of my refill, Ive routinely had very healthy/wholesome experiences, full of work and calm, some of which I planned out ahead of time. But since I don’t usually sleep that night, the next day is much different, a total failure-type day usually with agonizing physical side effects. Its really sad.  I think if I had better education and resources I wouldn’t have gotten to this point. I suppose the adderall could have helped me “get smarter” at taking adderall 😂 but nope lol

Both my kids were born premature and spent months in the hospital/faced life threatening procedures but are genuinely healthy now. My younger sister recently died by suicide and it has left me very broken. I also lost my grandmother who I was very close with to cancer this year. I’m struggling. 

In many ways, adderall has become my vice. And if I’m not taking more of it to be happy, chances are I’m drinking earlier or buying a bunch of things to try and make me happy. 

Now I find myself out of adderall early. Today was actually my first day I could refill and chose not to. Tomorrow will be my 4th day without adderall and I’m exhausted, cranky and completely zapped of energy but want to try and find the hopeful, empathetic, optimistic, romantic, people-loving person I used to be. I am hoping I can rediscover some of myself as I ditch the medication I’ve come full circle in all of the wrong ways on. 

Sorry for such a long post. If you chose to read, I’m genuinely grateful for your time. I guess what I’m wondering is...

1. Does it get better?
2. If so, when? 
3. What helped you?

I also recently quit my job to spend my time studying to switch into a UX/UI design career and also to have more time & energy to make art. However, I've found for the last 2 weeks since I've been unemployed, I cannot bring myself to study much less do anything productive, bombarded by thoughts and plans to get work done but never having the energy to finish a task without getting distracted blablabla typical ADHD symptoms.

I don't want to re-enter the hole of abusing stimulants again, so I just bought some Lions Mane capsules from Amazon (Real Mushrooms brand). I'm wondering if anyone here has tried it, especially those who have also used ADHD medication and how they find the two compare?",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.81367373}"

So when I do finally sleep,ill sleep for like 12 hours. And like I said,I've got atleast 2 months of no drug use under my belt. Sleeping plenty,eating probably too much but I dont have any unhealthy weight gain. So when I am awake and I hit the 12 hour mark,I'm ready to go back down for another 12.

I'm also 881 days sober from a daily habit that had my physically dependent on whiskey and psychologically dependent on meth - a litre a day of whiskey and gram a day of meth. 

For 2 years from mid 2016 through mid 2018.

I ended up cut off from my 2 kids and my family and evicted from my apartment and fired from my job and surviving on handouts from friends and acquaintances until there was no one left to help me in almost any way.

One of the things that struck me during this using period was how isolated and lonely I became as a result of the need to lie about my using. To see my kids I had to lie to my ex and pretend I wasn't using. To connect with my family I had to lie and pretend I wasn't using. To stay employed I had to say I had gastro or flu once or twice a week. To get my dealer to come over I had to say I had the $$ on me when I didn't. To get the hookers to stay longer I had to promise I'd transfer the money tomorrow when I knew it would be a week. To explain another missed flight to visit my dying mum in hospital in another state - I'd say just about anything.

In the end, the pain and shame of all the lies left me isolated and alone. Virtually no one would talk to me in just a casual normal way over the phone at night because there was this unspoken thing where I wasn't being honest about my using.

In the end, the lies made me feel less than a loser - they made me feel alone and lost in a deep and profoundly sad way. Deep down in the depths of my being. As someone who once had so much in life - I felt more lost and alone than I ever imagined possible.

Over the past 2.5 years as I've gotten and stayed sober - I've read posts in this forum most days. I've often thought it's awesome that people can have connection to others through Stop Speeding. That they can build relationships and talk about heavy stuff and light stuff with others who get where they are at ......and can do so without judgement or the need to lie.

I'm sober today and grateful to be so. I have all my relationships back and life is amazing in many ways.

But when things were very different back when I was using - I really wish I'd found and been active in this forum.

I think it would have helped me a lot to connect to others without the need to lie about my using.

2020-12-10 10:45:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/kahkiq/my_experience/,My experience,"Hello everyone, I figured I'd share my experience on quitting adderall.

First a little about myself and my use. I began using adderall in college and it was the beginning of an affair that had ups and then big downs. At first I started using it for studying, and man did it work. I'd buy an adderall from a friend for around $5 then bunker down in the library for 10 hours at a time. Consistently I was able to ace my exams and felt a huge sense of accomplishment. Also it gave me a huge confidence boost, I remember thinking to myself ""holy shit, if I felt like this everyday I could literally be president."" I think it shows how it affects the brain but also the delusional confidence that it provides early on. 

This pattern continued throughout college however by the end I was noticing that I was developing more of a dependence. For example at the beginning of college I might buy five adderall at a time then ration them out and use them when I needed them. By the end of college if I bought five, i was going to use them in the next five days.

After college I decided to apply to law school and that meant taking the LSAT. For the first time I actually went to my doctor and managed to secure an adderall prescription. This is when things started getting slippery. At first it was great and I was super productive, but over time I began upping my dose and finishing my script early. By the end of law school I was taking my entire script in the first 10 days of the month and then would be nearly useless until I could get more. By this point I was also buying them from other people to supplement the ones that I had. 

Fast forward two years and the abuse continued. I was taking anywhere from 60-100mg per day and was completely useless without it. My skin looked like shit, I had dark circles under my eyes, and my mental health suffered. I would get hyper focused on stupid things and disregard everything else. I'd masturbate forever. I'd scroll social media for hours. When I didn't have adderall I wouldn't do anything but would make plans to complete all the tasks that I was neglecting for when I could fill my next script. Inevitably I would never get around to doing the chores even when I got my next dose of pharmaceutical grade speed. Furthermore, I was delusional and paranoid in my thought process. However, on paper I appeared successful. I had a job and a law degree. Inside I was a maniac, I had zero self control, and my drug use had spiraled to a point that I literally felt crazy. The craziest thing about it is no matter how much of the drug I took, by the end I could hardly accomplish any tasks. I would get loaded on adderall and sit in a dark room and scroll the internet. 

This past summer I accepted a job in a new city and decided that it was time to quit for good. I took my last few adderall during the drive to the new city so my first day sober was my first day in the new place. Here's my experience with being sober and the timeline:

Week 1: completely useless. I slept and slept and slept. Additionally, my appetite went through the roof.

Weeks 2-4: Feeling better, but still napping everyday. I also started work in week three. Luckily it was remote because I still needed mid day naps to get me through. I will say that during this period I was extremely motivated to stay clean.

Month 2-4.5 (present day): Generally I think I am improving. I no longer consistently sleep all day everyday and can get through a day without naps but it's not consistent. Some days I feel great, other days I feel groggy and can't think straight. I also crave it routinely, and think that ""if I just had one or two I could get all this work done."" Also, the progress at this point is slow and annoying. I want so badly to just consistently feel awake, clear headed and be able to do the work that I need to do. I guess that's just part of getting sober. 

My advice to anyone getting sober is just write off the first week or so. Plan to sleep a lot, it's hard to do anything else. Once you get through that you will gain some sense of functional energy so in that sense it's good but then the long road begins. Lots of fatigue, brain fog, and anhedonia. Exercise takes the edge off things but there is no magic bullet that I have found. Just know that it gets better and you can do it.

Sorry for the long post, I just wanted to get this out there. I have been reading this page since the day that I got sober and it has been an absolute godsend. Whenever I am feeling close to giving into my temptations and cravings I read this page for motivation. Thank you to everyone who is on here. Keep your heads up, it's a long road but I know we can get through this.

I’m an adult (27M) still in college trying to finish my Engineering degree. I’ve never had a problem with not abusing my medication, however I still experienced side effects from my use.

By far, the most effective treatment for me has been Adderall. However, on Adderall, I have horrible come downs and can’t sleep. It turned me into a monster in some ways. At the peak of my use, I was taking 60 mg of Adderall and 50 mg of Vyvanse, which is a lot.

I decided to take a step back about a year ago, and have recently started treatment again. I take 20 mg of Focalin XR currently, and I have finally developed the patience to titrate slowly, instead of jumping to the maximum FDA recommended dosage. I currently don’t really experience a come down, but the benefits are very minimal compared to Amphetamines, and I crave going back to Adderall on a daily basis, despite the side effects it gave me.

I’m concerned that since Adderall is a Dopamine agonist instead of purely a NDRI, I will never achieve what I’m looking for with Methylphenidate, and will never experience joy or happiness again. It’s a terrifying thought. I’m on other meds as well, which reduce the effectiveness of my stimulant, but still.

I don’t know whether to take it slow and titrate up to the maximum dosage of Focalin, and then transition over to Vyvanse at the lowest dosage to see if I can tolerate it. I just want to take things slow at this point, and try to develop focus without being high on stims. 

It’s difficult to even sit down and watch television, let alone to sit down and study. I’ve lost joy in everything, and don’t even play video games anymore. All I do is surf Reddit, and watch YouTube.

First off by no means I am not trying to downplay its medical benefits nor am I trying to criticize other users that take them. This is my view and experience

I am living with a relative (we are both in our late 20's) who is currently an avid user of Adderall, daily/every other day assuming around 30mg) for the passed 5-6 years or so...

I have been noticing drastic changes in his personality and just over all mental health. Resulting in -VERY short temper, -severe self motivated aggression (mostly verbal and sometimes threats of physical abuse), - narcissism -lack of empathy -unpleasant/toxic person to be around

by all means he wasn't a happy go lucky type of person before usage but I have noticed a huge increase in personality/side effects listed above since covid-19 lockdown

I have reached out to him on several occasions about his usage and how it is affecting his personality/behavior and our relationship.

I am losing hope and feel as if he going on a downward spiral, completely oblivious and in denial about his addiction....

I'm sure a few people have dealt with similar situations personally or know of someone like this. how should I go about this? should I step aside and let him face the consequences or step in and set up and intervention?(which I assume will end up potentially violent with me being punched in the face/end of our relationship)

The details surrounding my use are a bit hazy, as it kinda turned into an automatic thing. I’d guess that over the last 6 years I was taking approx 20-30mg of addy 6 days a week. 



It’s been hard. I think if I’m being honest with myself a big part of my usage was to self-medicate my depression. I never felt good enough, outgoing enough, confident enough, and the addys changed that... for a while. Last winter I was drinking pretty much everyday. Started gaining weight. When the pandemic hit, I found myself literally just speeding and staring out the window like Pablo from Narcos. 



After losing my job and a family member dying in May, I still was taking addies every day, often times just to sit around and smoke. Then I was taking xans so I could sleep. You know the drill. 



Well I got a new job, and the addies just weren’t helping like they used to. I was literally leaving work for all of my breaks with tears in my eyes just to go cry in my car. The job was destined to fail, and when it didn’t work out I decided to stop. After all this time I’ve still got a few concerta and ritalin left, but I never feel the urge to take them. 



It’s been tough relearning myself. I’m no longer content just power scrolling social media. It’s been tough finding things I enjoy. Now I also have the task of staring my mental health dead in the face. And it’s not pretty. 



A lot of days I still miss who I was on those pills, or maybe who I thought I was.

From experience, please don't ever try meth. It seems so casual and is a shit ton of fun, but damn does it wreck your life.

It puts a hook in your brain that never goes away. The hook is there forever. 

By hook I mean the desire to do it, the craving the taste and pipe and experience. You can easily rationalize it as being less severe than it is.

Imagine everything dear and precious to you. Family, friends, pets, hobbies. Meth will take it away. Meth strips your emotions and empathy and you lose the emotional connections with everything. 

And every second of pleasure you get, you will pay back  to Meth after you use it.

Here's the thing that I tell everyone: If you want to meet The Devil, and lose all that is dear to you, use meth.

i know i need to quit in general and everything, but i really am looking for some sort of comfort from others who have been through this same thing and were able to come out on the other side healthy and clean. i guess i really just want to know that i'm not alone in dealing with these health issues related to adderall abuse.... thank you",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.45403922}"

Lifting weights. Not for the reasons you think though.

So when trying to build muscle, the 2 most important things are sleep and diet. You need to make sure you’re eating and sleeping enough to build muscle. If you complete a heavy workout and then proceed to eat nothing and neglect sleep for the next 40 hours, you’ve essentially wasted the entire workout. You broke down your muscles and never let them recover. The workout was probably BAD for your body.

So after I get a good lift in, a few hours later I might be having crazy adderall cravings. But my brain instantly thinks “you can’t take adderall now. You won’t eat or sleep and then that workout you did 2 hours ago will be for nothing. “

Even the next day when your muscles are sore you need to keep sleeping and eating. The sore muscles are a great reminder that you need to make sure that you sleep / eat tonight so you can maximize that workout. 

I try to never go more than 1 day without working out now so I’ll always be in the mindset that “tonight I need to sleep and eat well.”

TL;DR: I'm 4 days into a somewhat random decision to stop taking adderall, and I'm trying to figure out what meds have done to my body, and if this is psychosomatic or not. Please comment with groups, or threads, or videos/content that have been useful to you in deciding whether to detox, or to change your meds.  
Specific questions:  
\-anyone have hand/wrist/finger numbness/pain, and difficulty articulating/gripping?

\-Feelings of hollowness?  
\-Difficulty in relationships, more blah about relationships, sex, romance, connection.  
\-impact of daily meds on your sex drive?

**BACKSTORY:**  
I’m a 36 year old man. I do theatre projects and work as a manual labourer on ships for money.

I’m about 20 months into a prescription of Adderall XR, first 20 mg now 25 daily, which I have only missed a handful of times.

A recent breakup and some life stuff has me taking stock of recent physical/mental/emotional problems and wondering if they are linked to adderall. I am 4 days into not taking these meds, and I've been kicking around on this and other threads, trying to grapple with what might be causing what, and if i should change how I take the meds: take a break every week, or detox once a month, or stop altogether, or lower the dosage?

I had never thought of adderall as a cause, because at pretty much the exact time I started taking amphetamines, some other major life changes happened, and I assumed that these things caused thephysical/emotional side-effects.  
**POSSIBLE CULPRITS:**

\-I got a steady, committed girlfriend for the first time.

\-I started punishing side-hustle working on cargo ships, and did that a lot.

\-I wrote a bunch of grants, (thanks adderall for the inflated self-esteem) and got a big grant, so I upped my game as a theatre artist, but also my stress levels.

So, I assumed that those life changes (NOT adderall) caused the following **PROBLEMS/SIDE EFFECTS:**

\-A slowly worsening numbness, pain, in hands/wrists/forearms, loss of articulation in fingers and wrists, loss of hand strength. (i attributed this to the physical labour/repetitive strain— always had some numbness since i was a bike courier, but it’s become much worse in the last year and a half).

\-cold hands/feet

\-stiff ankles, general “stiffness” and postural stuff that seems to be worsening (i figured this was stress and the physical labour)

\-Insomnia and anxiety (stress, relationship stress)

\-Less interest in sex, less of a physical feeling of horniness/more hollow sex drive, difficulty staying hard/interested when having sex. (I just assumed/assume this was incompatability).

\-change in feelings— hollowness, not caring about stuff that used to interest me, listening to music less. (I assume this was me just being really motivated to keep making theatre, but I also haven’t been done more theatre lol)

\-diminished appetite, eating just to fill myself up. (i figure this has to be the adderall)

I don't know how to give context for it so I'll get straight to the point. My brother is 21 and addicted to cocaine since an unfortunately young age. He works so he has access to a continuous source of money, up to now he was never the type to spoil all his money on drugs but recently he just couldn't stop.
He started vanishing for days without answering calls and then he would come back completely wasted.

After he broke up with his girlfriend things got worse, up until tonight when my father went and directly confronted him at a friend's house. Things went bad and few punches were thrown. Now mind me, my father isn't a loving and understanding person, he also installed a GPS on my brother's car without him knowing up until tonight, plus he made many other mistakes in the past so we can safely say that my brother and him don't have a good relationship.
Well tonight he decided to move out and couldn't be convinced otherwise.

I, being his older brother, feel so responsible for that. I couldn't do anything to help him or stop him before hand. I also have to admit that for a moment I was relived that he was leaving, and I hate myself for this, but he kept on comparing us to his friend and saying how a shitty family we were, that his true family were his friends and not us, that his friend was to him more of a brother than what I was.
I'll say that again, I hate myself for being relived.

I do really want to help him and bring him back but, apparently, up to now I have been no good to him and I don't know what to do. This whole situation is tearing up my family and for those of you who can relate, how did you manage to help someone that doesn't even want to look you in the face? How do you do that knowing that the place you think he'll be safe is the place he hates?

I am a little confused about the subreddit though  


I saw a post that seemed to imply that ADHD wasn't an actual thing, and now I'm honestly confused on if this sub doesn't believe in ADHD or not. I don't want to upset anyone, and I'm honestly just confused. I have a severe case of ADHD, and I take perscribed medications for it. So when I see a post that seems to perpetuate the idea that ADHD is something made up thing just to make big bucks, I kinda did a double take? So far all of the stories have been about the recovery of different stimulant drugs, some mentioned different adhd medications but they never mentioned anything negative about ADHD itself. 

Obviously I never want anyone who doesn't have ADHD to take our medication, for a non ADHD brain it is not going to have the best effect. My medication works for me, and is benificial for me. But that isn't the same for a non ADHD person, and they could easily become addicted to my medication. It's why I have to make sure no one can get ahold of my perscription, even friends. Some people think our medications are some magical study drug when they just... aren't. I know people ask for our medications from us, and I am fully aware that I should never give it to them.   


My question: Is this subreddit anti ADHD? I know I tend to hyperfocus on small things easily, which is why I'm asking. I could very easily be misunderstanding and magnifying a small portion of this community. I know I tend to get ranty, so I tagged it with triggering content because I do mention medication? I don't know what would be considered triggering so I'm doing my best to air on the side of caution here, I never want to discourage anyone.

I went to work today, first day in 3 days. On adderall I was the first one there and last one to leave, and I LOVED it. I love my job. I’m a manager and I’m important and people rely on me, but today I felt, stupid. I couldn’t type as fast as I’m used to and I got angry at my hands. I could barely write. Someone asked me a question and I could barely form a sentence. When will I love my job again? I had to leave early because kept breaking down into tears and for the first time in months I’m not invincible and I’m not the strong person I had everyone believing I was. 

People used to compliment me on how I pushed through the hours without breaking a sweat, or how I got so much done in a day, and I’d just shrug and encourage them to try to do the same, but who was I kidding. It was a pill that was doing it for me.

Can't stand putting my life ""on hold"" one day longer.","I haven't spoken to many speed addicts IRL, but after lurking around this sub for the past year, my guess is that many of us in here developed an addiction partly out of a desire to ""do it all."" We weren't necessarily looking to ""numb out"" like users of many other addictive substances. Instead for many of us, I'd guess it was the opposite. We were looking for an ability to keep going...to ""outsmart"" normal human boundaries and annoyances like the need for sleep, food, and recharge/downtime.

Unfortunately, as I'm sure many of you know, what goes up, must come down....and the story is no different when it comes to speed. It may take many years for it to really catch up to us (it took me well over 5 years of regular use before it became a ""problem""), but catch up to us, it does. The result of my addiction getting unmanageable, for me at least, has been an extended period of ""downtime""---i.e. severe depression/anxiety/a complete inability to be productive with or without drugs.

But I'm sick of it. I want control of my life BACK. I'm sick of hiding away, afraid to face the messes I've made of my life. I was such a doer and a lover of life until my Adderall/Vyvanse addiction got completely out of control. I MISS LIFE. I have been hiding away for 2-3 years now in a general state of misery...cycling between binging on drugs, accomplishing nothing but digging my hole a bit deeper while high, hating myself intensely, sleeping for days, and binging again. Over and over and over again. The cycle repeats. I lie to myself each time I binge that ""this will be the last time""...""I will fix my life this time...I need it to fix everything..""

I AM DONE. I have tried to quit 5-6 times for real now. I've been in this very sub (different username) proclaiming how I am done before. Well, now I really am. Because my life is passing me by and I simply cannot do it one day longer. I am going to EMBRACE THE FEAR and anxiety of facing what my life has become. I am sick of being a COWARD. Whatever pain awaits me in sobriety and facing reality will be worth being able to MOVE THE FUCK ON with my life. Because I have a lot of shit I want to do and see and accomplish and experience and I am not going to do or see or feel ANY OF IT as long as I continue in this destructive cycle. It is NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

Have the support of my family friends and my girl. It's made it a lot easier. But I'm still an addict. I have cravings as we do. Yesterday I had a moment of weakness. I had gotten a call as I left my girls house. It was my mother. She was screaming at me through the phone for some stupid shit. And to talk on that call I pulled into a CVS. Just to talk to her so I wouldn't have a panic attack while driving. And after I got off the phone I knew benze was in there. So I went in. I walked to where the benze was. I looked at it. Picked it up. But in that moment. I put it back. All I could think about while holding it was the pain it's caused me and everyone in my life who cares for me. I didn't do it. But I almost did. At first I hated myself for even going in there. But now I see what I did in the end as a sign that I'm much stronger than I used to be. I see it as a big step in the right direction. Being able to put it back and not get high was something I would not have been able to do a month ago. I've faced hardships and recovery hasn't been easy. But I'm so much stronger than I used to be.

I'm proud of myself for not doing it. My girl seems like she's upset that I even went into the store and didn't call her in that moment. Which I understand. But I hope she sees it this way as well in the end. Cause at the end of the day. I proved that yes. I have my moments of weakness. But I also proved that I have much more strength than I usually give myself credit for. The cravings for drugs in general have been very bad lately. But I'm hanging in there and staying strong and keeping my head up. I'm not going to let these drugs take over my life again.

I think Ill wake up and go to the early morning AA and then hit the gym and then spend $20 on a stacked blt club sandwich instead that will leave me 100x more satiated and feeling good for the remainder of the day.

I used to tell myself I wasn’t addicted because I never went looking for it. I’d only do it or buy it when offered. However, I had a friend who was getting it pretty frequently from someone else with a script. I buy like 10 twenty milligrams at a time. Then I found others who would sell and pick up more. It’s gotten to be something I literally crave. The euphoria, the clearness, the longevity. I’m a college student so it help immensely with the late nights I have. I feel smarter, wittier, more balanced. I’m at a point now where all I do is want to be high. The money I spend on it alone is insane. It’s the only pharmaceutical I ever liked.

When I don’t have it, I can’t get out of bed. All I wanna do is sleep. I have zero motivation and ambition to do literally anything. I’m even scared to quit because I just like it so much. Idk what to do. I’ve even convinced myself I could probably convince a doctor at this point to prescribe them to me for my anxiety and depression but I know in my head that’s taking it way too far.

I ultimately always come back to the conclusion, especially after more regular use (i.e every day for a week) that the cons outweigh the pros and it's unsustainable (which I used to believe was BS, that it was totally sustainable but I've def changed my mind over this last period of use). But it's such a goddamn double edged sword, primarily because it does have remarkable positive cognitive/emotional benefits that keep my mental health stable...however idk if it's ""keeping it stable"" as much as it's distracting me, maybe from purely other med side effects.

I took a long break from Fall 2018-Summer 2019 but that was concurrent with klonopin withdrawal so it's hard to say if I was in a 'better place' then compared to now. However Spring 2019 was the last time I really felt like my mental health was in an upward trajectory. I've also been tapering from SSRIs since April 2019, and I'm finally about to take the last plunge and work my way off the last bit. 

Once I'm all done with the SSRI taper I'll either taper or cold turkey the Dexedrine use (I've kept it at a low dose this past year of use). At that point you'll probably be seeing a lot more of me lol.",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4785394}"
