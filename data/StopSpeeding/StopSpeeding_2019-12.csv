I really am looking for meth-specific advice. Please delete if inappropriate, mods.

I recently discovered that an old friend of mine, whom I'd lost touch with years ago, is using and dealing meth. I discovered this by idly googling her name to see what she was up to, and finding some really awful mugshots. I didn't even recognize her at first. I don't have any experience with meth or meth users and I'm not sure if it's a good idea to reach out to her. I don't want to get mixed up in her messy business but at the same time I really feel for her. This is someone I once considered to be a good friend. Should I do something? Based on the MANY arrests Google uncovered for me, we still live in the same county.

Thanks.",7

First.post.

Started Adderall when I was 17...now I'm 35. That's 18 years on the drug. 
That's crazy to type...


Even crazier...I'm 9 months sober. Trying to re-learn who I am without the drug. 

My question is about motivation. I'm not really sure how to phrase the question but ...does it ever feel like that again? 

Like...I've felt it without the drug: 
alive focused determined unstoppable.
Like when I'm really into something. 

But when I was on addy even the most mundane thing was incredible..breath-taking even.

**I'm am BREATH-TAKING-LY doing the dishes!**
                                     Lol.

From having to pop a pill to start my day to 
NO pill to start my day
...I've chanGed evolveD and GroWn. 

THE BEST CHANGE IS I AM FINALLY CLOSE TO THE PEOPLE I LOVE AGAIN . the best change is I like myself alot. The best change is things keep getting better. 

but yeah...my question is...
How does modivation feel with out the drug? Healthy motivation? 

Like I'm 9 months sober now...

..and I want to start performing again...i'm a singer
I want to lose weight...gained some after quitting the drug 
AND
I want to stop doubting myself and effing thinking about it. That I would have done it better with the drug...well not better but faster...
well i was NEVER better or necessarily faster when on addy I just THOUGHT I was. I dunno it that made sense? 

I guess this isn't so much a question as a VENT.

But I do want to know how other recover-ers have experienced a return to normalcy. When do hibitualities really begin to change and when do old triggers really begin to fade? 

Not gonna re=read this a million times. Just gonna hit POST.

Everyone on here is brave. Xoxo",49

On August 5th I went to detox for 35 days after a bad relapse spanning over several of the previous months. After detox I immediately went to sober living. This is my 10th time in a treatment program since 2012. I'm 23 years old, first experienced addiction with my prescription Vyvanse when I was 15.


This is what I wrote when I got high tonight. 

-

Just shy of 5 months clean from meth. January 5th, the day before my birthday would be 5 months. Almost half a year. That's a huge accomplishment for me. I wish I could have appreciated and loved it for what it was. I feel like in the early stages of this recovery, I was all for a clean and healthy lifestyle. I was on board with getting that shit out of my system and getting to work on healing. 


But of course, the nightmare of my addiction was still fresh in my mind, and I think I truly believed I wanted out. The reality is, that nightmare was never truly over, and the reality is, this addiction is a lot more deep-rooted and intricate than I ever gave it credit for. 


The past three months my mind started slipping further from the idea of recovery and closer to the idea of using and eventually the actual planning of my next relapse. 


One week ago, I found a bag of meth in a shopping cart directly outside the entrance of the supermarket. It was literally the most perfect opportunity to relapse; an early Christmas gift, and an early elimination of my ever subconsciously brewing relapse plan. I could have tossed it (Yeah, I know, who fucking would?) But fuck, I could have tossed it.
   I could have tossed it and dug a grave for the absolute best chance ever to relapse, finally proving to myself I *am* more powerful than this substance.


**Spoiler:** I am *not* more powerful than this substance.


 My uber had just arrived and it was idle right next to me. I took a hard look at the bag to convince myself it really was what I knew it was, and I took the bait. I hopped in the uber that could have been my escape route but turned it into my own mental prison sentence. 


So I held onto it for a very long week. Made it through an exhausting week of work with nothing but the usual constant flows of power drinks and nicotine; the stereotypical recovering addicts choice. But I knew my relapse was around the corner. My mind was permanently made up when I grabbed that baggie. When I grabbed that baggie, I threw away my biggest accomplishment in years. 
Years...months...dictated by one second. 


Now that I'm finally leaving sober living and moving into a studio apartment where I'm the only house manager, I knew I could get high. The tiniest bit, not even a percent of my past doses. The smallest amount I've ever done in my life. 
I figured I would write, finally pick up my guitar, maybe respond to the dozens of important messages I've selfishly never opened. 

 
I did none of these things. I sat in a chair and no matter how hard I tried, my fantasy was postponed and reality was forced on me. 
 

The only thing I felt and still feel is unfathomable regret; absolute shame, disappointment and sadness. Its pitiful, as soon as I dosed, I felt miserable. And the saddest part of that is it came from the purest part of my conscience; a place that had been masked by the insanity of this addiction, but never truly went away.  


I always knew I had another relapse in me, but I didn't know if I had another recovery in me. I still don't know if I can put an honest effort into an eleventh treatment program. In fact, I can almost positively say I won't. I'm too embarrassed at this point. If recovery is ever going to work for me, I need to realize it has to come from within- from my own strength and determination. If it doesn't come from that, any time spent in a program is just another tolerance break.

Thanks for reading. I do believe I'll one day overcome this, but there's only one thing I feel I truly know about recovery after all these failed attempts:

That followed up by going back to 12 step meetings and whatnot is my only hope.

It is totally worth it.,"I was basically working my ass off to keep myself working my ass off. I made a lot of money but ended up spending at least half of what I made on meth. When I quit, I went through about 8 days of misery but I refused to let it keep me from going to work.

 What initially made me decide to quit was when I came to the realization that none of the people I was using with were truly my ""friends"" because they enjoyed hanging out with me/genuinely liked me as a person. The same thing goes for me with them. We were all just using each other for drugs. 

I give all the glory to my Lord and savior, Jesus Christ for keeping me sober this long. Every relapse period I have had, there has been some sort of lesson learned, since I was saved in rehab in May of 2017. That was my rock bottom. It has been all uphill from there. I'm not trying to preach, just telling what's worked for me so far.

Actually felt like my life was getting better. I was more focused on being social, sorting out my habits and so on. Felt happier and lighter really despite missing that feeling of being ultra productive. I even went on a trip abroad to meet a dude I've never met before which was fun. I've never traveled alone in my life before! 

Things were looking so up that I thought I'd be good with some amphetamine. I'm moving soon so I figured I'd get some to help out with the cleaning. So I bought 5g, fully believing I could keep it under control.

5 days later and I'm already through 2.6g. Only slept twice during that time. Didn't even get to clean, I was too preoccupied with hobbies instead. Ended up flushing it all but still I managed to get my hands on Vyvanse so now I'm reaching the 24 hour mark awake yet again. Feels bad. And I still haven't cleaned. 

It's crazy how fiendish I get once I first get a taste. I just can't resist the urge to keep taking it which is crazy when compared to my early days of only dosing once during the day. Didn't even take it that often either, maybe once every week or fortnight.  

On the bright side, the last week has been a reminder of how this shit makes me feel overall. Sure, it feels fucking great to be a machine who can sit with mentally taxing work for 30 hours straight. I get so much shit done too. But overall? It's making me really unhappy. I'm trading my happiness for productivity and that doesn't feel right. Yet I keep coming back, convinced that I can moderate my use.

I guess there's a part of me who is convinced I need this drug. It's as if my standards for productivity has reached a unreachable height and I feel like I can't lower it again. I just get frustrated at my lack of concentration and my lack of willpower. Plus, I've got ADHD too so part of me feels like I should be using this drug to manage that. But yeah. I just end up binging. 

Just wanted to vent my shitty mood here. Feeling disappointed in myself for going so crazy after staying away from it for so long. Luckily I'm all out now so I'll try to keep this experience in my head for next time I consider buying more.",4
2019-12-27 05:20:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/eg9jj8/oops/,Oops.,"Was going to “quit” until New Years Eve, possibly longer. Ended up buying a point five (?) days ago... whilst that was by chance, as I didn’t know that the person I ended up buying it from was dealing. What I can’t defend is buying a new pipe the day after (left both of my previous pipes with a friend, when I was still in the headspace of never-touching-it-again). I didn’t say that I was quitting, and that was for a reason; the reason being that I know myself well enough to know that I tend to want things I can’t have, and whilst there are exceptions to that rule, I had a feeling that this wouldn’t be one.

First few days went great. Mostly because I was full of myself, and my supposed moral superiority. I’m back on medication for ADD now, so I had no excuse to continue using. I’m not at the right dose (35mg dexamphetamine), but it’s enough to be semi-functional, which is much better than nothing at all. Regardless, I was mostly okay in the first few days.

Then reality set in. I was bored, and didn’t know what to do with myself, but I told myself that I didn’t want to use. This was not actually true - of course I did, but I chose not to. What I did do was buy some weed off an acquaintance of mine. He asked me if I wanted to try his puff. And that was all it took. 

The upside is that this point has lasted me five days (before, it would be gone in a day) and that’s mostly because it’s cut with PEA, which is an interesting molecule that tastes like shit. Either way, it’s not a total loss, and I’m actually not all that upset about it. This is probably because my motivation to quit in the first place came from a place of paranoia, not genuine want. 

I can afford to use at the rate I was before now, but why bother? It only caused problems - my tolerance was all over the place, as were my emotions, the latter resulting in a very impaired social life. The question is, now what? I don’t know, and I don’t really care, to be honest. But I don’t want the mindset I had before coming back, and that does genuinely scare me. So I’ve got that going for me, at least. But for now, I’m going to do my best to keep myself in check, and that means being responsible (read: as responsible as one can be when doing such things) with the amounts that I’m using. If I’m going to make bad choices, I’ve got to at least make good choices within the bad choices, ya know?",4

Month 1: Worsening mood, anxiety, depression, poor motor control, etc

Month 2/3: Peak anxiety, sleep disturbances, stress/concern over duration of symptoms, brain-fog

Month 5-6: Greatly improved in comparison to first few months, lessened strength of symptoms but still present

Months 7-10: Continuous improvement, sleep disturbances should be minimal

1 Year Onward +: It can take 12-16 months to fully recovery and even longer for others depending on how hard their usage was/neurotoxicity/genetics, but you shouldn’t even think about it in comparison to the feelings from the first month, life feels good.

I've quit a few times now (and relapsed), but each time I learn something new about myself that either helps me stay clean or improves my outlook/satisfaction with life. Unfortunately, this last relapsed was mostly about lessening my self-loathing and guilt as these feelings are overly-intense for me and distract me from real problems like my health, family, etc.

I feel so bad for my wife. I'm surprised she has stuck around  this long. I want to be  trooper and put on a brave face for her, but it's just not that simple.

I think for my own sanity I need to keep the option open of changing the start date, but if I back out then it's going to be rough. Plus I don't think I will get much out of the program unless I enter it motivated to quit. I don't want to come out of it and relapse right away, like I did once before to ""celebrate"".

Day 3-4: This day is the worst, cravings are bad and you feel like the withdrawals never will end.

Day 6-10: This is where thing begin to get better. A good idea is to start working out it helps a lot. You'll be really happy that you made it this far, and you'll feel strong!

Day 10-15: This is the last stages of the withdrawals. You might still feel a little tired and not really have the same level of motivation as you had before. You'll feel much better as you have ever felt. The cravings are not as strong as they was before and you might only get 1-4 cravings a day. You'll begin to feel happiness again.

So I have a complex but probably pretty common problem that a lot of people face. Would love to get some great actionable advice from the awesome people on this sub. 

So I have a history of addiction, mainly to opioids like kratom. I've been struggling with kratom for the better part of 5 years, trying to quit multiple times and going through the horrendous withdrawals many many times. 

I also have an adderall script because I thought because of my symptoms of never being able to stick with anything, losing interest very quickly after novelty wears off, trouble with keeping commitments, and basically never succeeding in anything not because Im stupid, but because I fail to take care of the basic shit normal people do easily, I said fuck it and lets see what a therapist says. 

Well, I fill out a checkbox sheet that indicates that I have adhd, not sure how reliable that diagnosis method is. So I've been taking adderall off and on for 3 years, mainly off because kratom has filled that void for me. But they all do the same thing. All drugs do. They take away my soul for the promise of a better life, productivity, etc. 

Now here's the thing. I've never binged like most on this sub. I've never gone over 60mgs in a day, and rarely do more than 30 when I take it. But I just got a new job with some pretty big players, and need to make sure I am on point both mentally, quantitatively, and life. I just know myself too well that I will probably fail if I am not medicated, which I know deep down inside, the tradeoff isn't worth it. 

Adderall takes away a piece of me, listed as a side effect, but it gets bad to the point where I can't take it more than 5 days in a row, even a low doses, because of the body load. Then I switch to kratom, and the rotation of this shit stained life of addiction I've been in keeps going round and round. 

I'm sure these questions come up often, but I just don't think I can fulfill my potential without meds. In my mid 30's, I know the pattern recognition of my life, and it isn't good. I guess the question I'm asking is even if I have adhd, is it realistic to think that I can manage my life and fulfill my potential without being medicated? I know the rouse of drugs, and I know how fucked up things can get pretty quickly. I want to quit everything, but then will fail at this great opportunity if I don't. It feels like I'm selling my soul for the promise of a more comfortable, successful life. I just don't know how to decide. 

Thank you for reading. 

Tldr: History of drug addiction, never really binged on adderall, can't take it more than 5 days without feeling like utter shit, new opportunity and nervous that I will fail like everything else in my life before meds and drugs. Anyone successful after being diagnosed with ADHD without meds?",6

Of course, I’m tired. The anhedonia I’ve read about on here I get alot of too. But I’ve noticed things about myself I’ve almost forgot in the time I was on adderall. 

I’ve been so silly these last few days. Today especially I was feeling really creative, wanting to play piano and write poems that were pretty stupid. *I have a personality.* I’m not so serious. I’m trying to hold on to all the joyful moments I feel in these off days.

I’m not overthinking everything when I’m with my friends. I’m not worried about the dumb things I say. I’m also enjoying food A LOT. Got panda express yesterday, had a huge feast at a family reunion today. Ate a dozen cookies.

I’ll try to eat healthier, but at this point I’m literally trying to gain weight. I’m already skinny and my family has taken notice a bit, which I hate. A few more weeks and I don’t think I’ll have to hear that any more!!!

**A message to everyone struggling:** hold on to every positive thing you can find in this shitty withdrawal process and connect more with your true self. Remember when you were a ten year old and silly and fun and confident? That’s still you. Fight for your authentic self. ☺️",8

The past 10 days, I was using at least 45-65 mg/day (+300ish mg caffeine) to grind work for finals (I go to a very rigorous college).  Here's some potential withdrawal symptoms I've noticed:

\-Significantly increased appetite - I can't stop thinking about food and constantly want to eat

\-Complete lack of sex drive

\-*Severe* mental fog, I can't concentrate on jack shit

\-apathy

\-anhedonia/mild dysphoria

\-abscence of mental energy/""idea generation"" if you will - takes significant effort to maintain conversations

\-sleeping a fuck ton, I slept for 11 hours last night

\-bizarre and vivid dreams + night sweats

I’m looking for any support you can offer me. Only one person in my life knows, and they’ve never done speed so it’s quite hard for her to understand the extent of it. Addiction scares the shit out of me. My father was addicted to Benzos for years, and spent months in a rehab facility when I was l younger. I didn’t even know about his drug use until the inevitable happened. All of my siblings and parents suffer from anxiety really bad, and until now, I thought I suffered much less than any of them.

Anyway, here’s my story. I started dating my best friend around the time I got a presciption. I started using in May and asked him out in June. I went two months using it (for the most part) as prescribed, but that didn’t last long. It got way worse when I headed back to school. I would say I was on adderall a majority of the time. There were always a few days I’d feel guilty and not wanna take it, but I always went back. In the last few months, I’ve binged many times. Doing things for hours and hours that were a complete waste of time. Watching porn all night. I feel so much remorse for the things this drug makes me do. This is my third attempt at giving it up.

I broke up with my boyfriend about a month ago. We’ve gone through a lot. He knew of my use, but the drug made me shady. It made me not feel like myself, and I felt lost and confused about my feelings. I felt like I was letting him down more than putting him up. I’d constantly ask him if he thought I was crazy. I’d be pissed at him over absolutely nothing. I’d go days treating him like a stranger and not even realize it. 

Before adderall, I never doubted myself. I assured my Ex before Thanksgiving break that I was done with adderall, as my presciption ran out. The first day home for break I re-filled my prescription. I’ve been on it since then, until I ran out again yesterday morning. To his knowledge, I’m off the drug. 

Yesterday morning, I ran out. After a two day binge, I just couldn’t take it any more. I went into my room where I keep my prescriptions for the next few months, and ripped them into pieces. I’ve got no pills left and I ripped up all my re-fills. I’m DONE!!!! 

I would love any advice for withdrawal and staying off that you can give. If you’ve made it this far, thank you SO much for listening to me rant.",4

I'm 22 and have been prescribed it for two years, however, I took it upon myself to get a prescription after using it in college. The first time I took it was the first time that I was able to sit down and complete an assignment. Naturally, I began using it more and more until I was using it daily. And after a semester of taking it for class, I go my first ever 4.0. I began looking up symptoms of ADHD and realized that I was the most adhd person I had ever met. This is why I had flocked to adderall in the first place; It was a step towards leveling the playing field for me.

After a while I went to get a prescription as I was transferring to a highly regarded business school, leaving my addy dealer at home. I had abused it in the past but only on finals weeks where one was ineffective due to taking it for about three weeks straight (no t Breaks). I was prescribed 20 MG vyvanse at first and never abused it. Unfortunately, my insurance does not cover adderall (non generic) or vyvnase. Due to the outrageous out of pocket price of vyvanse my doctor switched me over to 20 mg adderall XRs. I never really felt them the way I had IRs so I began to abuse them on days where I had a lot to do.

Fast forward a semester an my current roomate moves into the apartment I had sublet (after transferring schools). This has normalized a ""full tweaker"" atmosphere. This includes, but is not limited to;

* abusing our meds
* talking about pit sweat
* not partaking in activities that do not provide instant gratification (so not doing anything but my homework and playing guitar)
* staying up until 5 when I have to be up at 8  

   * my roommate pops 140 mg of vyvanse and streams all day, its only at about 3 when he comes out and we stay up talking
* Binge eating ramen on the crash to fall asleep

However, I hate this lifestyle and want to be able to enjoy sitting on the couch with my lady again. I want to stop blowing my lady off to play guitar until my brain feels like a noodle. Also I want to stop writing weird ass, tweaker emails to my professors. 

I feel I can do this by reverting back to my normal dose. Have any of you been in a similar situation? Am I in too deep? Adderall has done wonders for me when I didnt abuse it, I just want to know if it will again/if I’m able to.",10

So for the past two years I have been living on the fringe of mania. Taking/prescribed 20mg of Addy XR daily. Not uncommon for me to take more than prescribed and have to source it elsewhere before my refill. I make music. The amount of time and number of hours I've spent in my studio alone making stuff in this manic state is almost sickening to think about. Although I have made some really awesome stuff and have grown so much in my craft... My body can't take it anymore. My brain probably can't either. It would not be uncommon for me to pull 18 hour or even 24 hour studio sessions. Where I would have maybe one shitty meal. Back when I was still working a day job, it wouldn't be uncommon for me to work a whole week on one or two hours of sleep a night. Taking addy after work for the studio all night, then taking it in the morning to get through work. Sometimes I just wouldn't sleep at all. I've lost so much weight, and I'm already a thin guy. (28yrs old). I also party a fair amount being in the music scene and all... 

&#x200B;

I'm on day 3 of cold turkey quitting. I'm already prone to depression, and it's starting to hit bad. I am going for a small run after I post this, and plan on exercising a bit every day. Luckily I don't have to go to a day job. But I don't even want to get out of bed. I'm worried that I won't be able to keep up with all the projects I've now got going in the studio. I am taking this whole week to only focus on getting better and getting through these withdrawals. How long could they last? I'm mostly concerned about the depression... It can get pretty bad for me as there's other shit going on in my life that's only making it worse...

I’m not yet ruling them out, I think that a little anxiety might even be good because I am having such trouble just getting out of bed and being motivated to do anything (even things not “higher level cognitive”). But so far the anxiety hasn’t been the mobilizing type.

Hope this helps someone!

Hi Reddit - 

I posted my adderall recovery journey 3-4 months ago and a few users suggested I post it every few months in case others find it useful. Im going to try to remember to do that so here it is: 

I quit after taking this stuff for 10 years and haven’t touched it in over 2 years. This is all just MY EXPERIENCE and others may have a different opinion but for me, this is what it took. I’m not here to judge anyone else or say what’s right/wrong, this is simply my journey. 

I had to go cold turkey. I tried quitting many times but cold turkey is all that ever worked. Everything else is just denial or an excuse. I told myself I would taper down or slowly stop or whatever but I just needed to STOP and stop making excuses. I found reading other people’s Journey was helpful when I was trying to quit so here’s mine in the event it gives you even an ounce of conviction or strength. 

I took Adderall for 10 years (21-31) and quit just over a year ago. I live in San Francisco and have a VERY demanding, fast paced job in tech where I manage a team so that was the part that made me the most nervous but I realized I was picking everything else over my Health. I got to a point where I “needed” adderall to be “me” - so was that even me? It was so so hard for the first 2-3 months, I was so tired and felt like a zombie but was just gentle as fuck with myself and after the 3 month mark I felt functional. Around the 5-6 month mark I felt GOOD. Actually, like a new person.

Never in a trillion years did the old adderall me ever think I’d be able to be disciplined/productive without it - but here I am.... happy, have normal energy like a normal human, just as successful in my job (I def underperformed for those 3-4 months - keeping my head above water professionally was the hardest part but treating each day I said “no” to adderall as a victory was how I got by). Reading stories on here and quittingadderall.com helped (make an account - distract yourself by engaging on there). Exercising first thing in the AM before my brain could realize how tired it was.

I was VERY hungry so cooking/prepping healthy food was key as well. Fresh, whole fruits/veg. L-tyrosine, magnesium, fish oil and other vitamins that may or may not have helped but I did like the “tradition” of taking pills every morning (they probably helped - there’s a lot of info online about different things you can take to help with brain health as you recover). I even took pre workout powder with water each AM in the beginning to get a little kick. Whatever it took. Time, sleep, clean eating, exercise/moving, coffee, distraction/quittingadderall.com, supplements.. that’s what did it. In that order. I also found not eating after 7pm really helped with the morning brain fog. 

My point: I remember it very clearly. For years. The guilt of taking this drug. I went through all the normal phases of first discovering it, LOVING the shit out of it, everything was suddenly so amazing (until it wasn’t), becoming uber successful professionally (and subsequently setting a standard at work that’s just not humanely sustainable), then slowly realizing that I didn’t “feel” like I used to. That maybe I was a bit of a productivity robot. I felt I needed adderall to be the talkative, fun friend everyone expected me to be (creating anxiety). That maybe I just needed to accept that I WAS adderall. I NEEDED adderall.

And then the “ok I’m not addicted. I’ll just have a few a week. I don’t need to quit full stop... maybe just half of one a day.... or maybe I just stop for a little bit and see how I feel so I should just keep this bottle handy in case it doesn’t go well” —— then I listened to that insane, dependent mental negotiation I was doing with myself and realized “yeeeeep, that’s an addicts negotiation tactic.” This is not healthy.

I always made excuses for needing it ..... a big project, a friends bachelorette party, an event, whatever. I even went through the denial phase of “this is a medication. I have ADHD. My medical doctor gave me this. It’s medicine!” Oh brother, that was the hardest phase because I knew deeeeeep down I was in denial grasping at such an easy excuse for myself (this is just my own experience I’m sharing here - to each their own).

Then I realized that I have a very full life so there would always be an excuse. Was i really so insecure that I didn’t think the “undrugged” me could handle it? I then realized I didn’t even know me - was I willing to live an entire lifetime without ever knowing my authentic self? I was so scared.

I started by committing to one day at a time, mini goals. And, like I said, every day was celebrated like a victory. “Just one more day, one more week” —- the first 2-3 months I was a sleeping, sitting-at-desking, eating, slow-mo exercising machine. I felt like I got hit by a truck. Then it got better. Then it got ok. Then it got good. Then it got great. Now I feel amazing. Don’t get me wrong - I don’t feel HIGH. I feel like a normal human with normal waves of emotion (tiredness, energy, creativity, anger, sadness, happiness, excitement, laughter, everything). Normal waves - not extreme waves like addy gives you. It’s so good to be alive and get to know me. Anyone can be “someone” on adderall and there are very similar traits — but there’s only one you. Get to know you. The playful you. It’ll take a while to get back that person so be patient and loving with yourself. Don’t think that whoever you meet the first few months is the new you. It’s not. It takes a little longer.

I am also amazed at how capable I am. I think back to when I was Adderall and I feel like I PRODUCE just as much at work. I’m not hyper focused with quick witted things to say in meetings — but I get my shit done, I get it done well, and I feel ... real.

I remember the struggle. I remember the self doubt. I remember the fear. I still think of adderall every day and occasionally want it, but I mostly think “I can’t believe I fucking took that capsule full of little toxic beads every single day for 10 years - wtf was I thinking?” —- which is major progress from what I felt for the first few months (“I just want one. Just half of one. I’ll start next week”).

It takes time, discipline and self love. I’d say the self love is was kept my drive to stay off of it high — I’ve worked hard on myself throughout my life and deserve to be as healthy as I’m capable of being. I want to have a family some day and they deserve a healthy me as well. Why rob myself of that.

I’m sorry this is so long but the details are important. It’s not easy.  Please feel free to DM me if I can help. You got this. You’re capable and amazing without any drugs - get excited to get to know the real you. The undrugged, pure you.",30

Everything worked well for about a year before my tolerance started to creep upwards. The beneficial effects of the medication dwindled to nothing - no extra focus, no extra motivation.

After quite a while of messing around with changing vyvanse dosage, my psych and I agreed that it wasn't going anywhere. He decided to try dexedrine alone and put me on 50mg a day. This was a few months and it's the point at which everything started to go seriousy wrong. My tolerance came back with a vengeance. The dexedrine felt like it was doing nothing.

Being the idiot I am, I decided to increase the dose. This worked for a while but it led to the inevitable downward spiral of further increases of dosages.

I guess that honesty is part of recovery so I'll be honest about how bad the problem is: today I took 500mg of dexedrine. My tolerance is so high that all it lead to was some tremors and a little bit of agitation. I can't believe that i am able to tolerate dosages this high. 500mg would've killed me a few years ago.

I'm now completely sick of this. I don't want permanent mood problems from stimulant abuse. I don't want drug-induced tremors. I don't want drug cravings.

My first question is this, should I check myself into rehab/inpatient or should I make an attempt to do this on my own?

my mood was stable and improving, I was getting things done. Then 2 days ago a friend of mine decided to order some speed. For context, this person is an extremely responsible user that has strict limits, uses stims only like once a year and has never binged or even dosed above a low dose. And for these reasons I feel way too ashamed and stupid to tell them how easily I give in to abusing stims, so I stupidly aggreed to keep it at my place. But by that point I was still in a good mindset and really not even close to wanting to use it myself.

But the day after, just knowing it was there, I really couldn't stop thinking about it. All of a sudden everything felt extremely uncomfortable, boring and pointless and time crept by by the second just because I knew what I *could* be doing. Then , and I literally don't know or understand my reasoning, I decided to ""just do a little bit""  and make it ""my last time"".

Of course what ended up happening was me dosing way way way too much, repeatedly, all throughout the night. It seriously wasn't even enjoyable. It all felt wrong , I was tense and anxious the whole time, and bored even. The day after I started hitting psychosis extremely rapidly (feels like it's triggered more easily every time I do stims) and started having visions and paranoid delusions. This caused me to miss and fuck up a whole  bunch of very important shit I had to do yseterday and today. I fell into my normal post-binge pattern of staying up 2 days afterwards, and for some reason not really coming down untill after I've slept (for this reason I start anxiously avoiding sleep) , so I just came down today and basicly just did nothing and felt very very bad and ashamed.

I guess the point of this story is that I got no enjoyment out of this. The best part of this whole experience, was the ""hype""  and the fantasy that came right before it. I was so excited right before getting home, and for what? Even strong physical euphoria, the pleasure, everything, it doesn't feel right anymore because I don't really want it.  On the bright side: I kept going for one night, which is drastically shorter than my previous binges of 2-4 days. And it's not due to running out, I actually made a more or less reaonsable decision to stop. 

But god damn I'm just tired of this. This pattern has been repeating every 2 weeks for a few months now and I reallt don't want it anymore. What started out as pure pleasure has turned into all compulsion, there's really nothing enjoyable about it anymore.

Hopefully, to whoever reads this, you’ll think twice before doing what I did. 

Read now, and read carefully if you’re in the same or similar position I was in 4 years ago; a grade 11 student facing final exams who was average and just wanted to overachieve for once. This is going to be the long story of my 4 year severe dependency on Vyvanse. Let’s begin.

THE FIRST TASTE OF VYVANSE

  I was tired of being an average student despite putting in my best effort, just once I wanted to be above average, like the smart kids in my class who seemed to effortlessly get high grades without studying much. My friend knew I was struggling with studying for finals, so he offered me something called “Vyvanse”. I’d never heard of it before, but he made it sound so appealing - the ability to study 10-12 hours with no interruption, extreme focus and retain everything. So a week before finals in Grade 11, he gave me 80mg of Vyvanse - my very first dose. 

   I’ll never forget the feeling of that first 80mg - I felt like I could understand anything. Everything I was studying for my finals seemed to be the most interesting thing in the world, I felt a surge of motivation I’d never felt before in my life. I effortlessly sat down and studied chemistry for 10 hours nonstop, and understood everything. From that night on, I was HOOKED - hooked onto the unnatural high and the feeling of being the best in my class. I knew more than the overachievers, and all it took for me was a few small pills to study more than they ever had. 

   I went to my doctor immediately and asked for a Vyvanse prescription, lied about having ADHD; nothing could stop me now. With those pills, I thought I’d never have to worry about school again. The talkativeness that comes with Vyvanse made me (a person who had very few friends) want to be engaged in any conversation that I could be in. I thought to myself, “hey, I just found the answers to anything I stress about- Vyvanse.”

FIRST YEAR OF VYVANSE DEPENDANCY

   Now with my very own prescription, I felt like I’d never have to worry about school stress again- I almost felt smug as I thought about my classmates who could only study for a certain amount of time before giving up. 

   My first year of dependency started after my Grade 11 finals, during my whole Grade 12 year. I’d take anywhere between 80-120mg of Vyvanse at least 3 -5 times a week, pull all-nighters then sleep during the day after school- it was perfect. I finished all of my work, did well on most tests, all without having to worry about “stress” or “lack of motivation”. My boyfriend questioned me about my excessive vyvanse use, but I always said I’d just stop using it after Grade 12, once I secured a spot in the university I wanted to go to. I had myself convinced I could just return to regular studying after using vyvanse 3-4 times a week for even the smallest things. 

   HOWEVER I started to notice myself becoming sick much more often, anything between kidney infections to cracking constant fevers. I knew the immense lack of sleep was affecting my immune system but I ignored it, thinking it was worth the grades and motivation Vyvanse gave me. I didn’t care how I was feeling or how sick I was as long as I had enough Vyvanse to spare for all-nighter after all-nighter. My acne worsened by 5 times and on top of being physically unhealthy , I also looked extremely unhealthy. I didn’t experience any comedown symptoms besides tiredness after a Vyvanse all-nighter, making it all the more better. The Vyvanse was beginning to take a toll on my body, but I refused to acknowledge the severity of my dependency. 

SECOND YEAR OF DEPENDANCY

  Now I’m in university, and I promised myself I’d wipe the slate clean and study sober. But when difficult university concepts and projects started to come up, I immediately turned back to Vyvanse. “Vyvanse just helps me understand things better” I thought as I continued to take doses of Vyvanse (80-120mg) 2-4 times a week “It’s helping me be a better student than anyone in my grade” I convinced myself, relentlessly taking dose after dose, even for the smallest of things. 

   My immune system continued to decline, and I was sick at least once every 2 weeks with something. At this point, after 2-3 years of continuously using Vyvanse and losing countless hours of sleep, I started to experience comedowns. The loss of appetite that comes with Vyvanse meant I didn’t eat for 2-3 days straight, and I started to feel more and more depressed after the Vyvanse wore off. Vyvanse comedown depression was absolutely brutal; my thoughts became clouded with extremely negative things, my anxiety skyrocketed, I wanted to be alone during every comedown, and nothing seemed to make me happy. It was like I was incapable of laughing at a joke or smiling during a comedown. Compared to my first year of dependency, my comedowns were increasing in severity week after week of Vyvanse abuse.

   I isolated myself to my room in my university dorm most of the time, either studying on Vyvanse or coming down from it. Either way, I missed out on university experiences I’ll never be able to get back because I was too busy coming down from Vyvanse or studying on it. I can confidently say that’s one of the biggest regrets I have to this day; most people’s first year of university is about meeting new people and making new friends, while my first year was a cruel cycle of studying on drugs, losing sleep and depressive, extremely unhappy periods of time between doses.

THIRD YEAR OF DEPENDANCY 

   I’ve now gotten past first year of university, going into my second. I try to keep away from the Vyvanse, but crack within a month of school starting and begin the cycle again. 

   Approximately halfway through my second year, the comedowns went from tolerable to downright horrible. They were extreme depressive periods where I didn’t leave my bed for 2 or more days, I didn’t eat for days and I usually got sick or caught an infection after pulling an all-nighter. I was consistently nauseous, and felt too weak to even get out of bed, constantly attacked by negative thoughts / feelings. The feeling of falling down an endless negative black hole, the Vyvanse comedown, began to scare me; my body couldn’t handle it anymore. I had to stop. I tried, but when I did, I realized exactly how hard it was to study sober after solely relying on Vyvanse for 3 years- especially with the difficulty of second year university material. 

   At this point I began to take Vyvanse less frequently, approximately once every week or once every two weeks if I could help it. I’d leave work until the last minute and pull a Vyvanse all-nighter in an attempt to finish all of the schoolwork I left for one day. Unlike high school where study materials were relatively easy, university content proved to be too much to try and cram into one night every 2 weeks- I ended up failing 2 courses.

   I began to question myself- Is Vyvanse really helping me at this point? Or is it just an excuse for me to leave schoolwork until the last minute? I saw my friends getting better grades than me despite my Vyvanse study nights. Vyvanse used to be an enabler for me to study more than others- now it became a way for me to procrastinate while others put diligent hard work.At this point I realized Vyvanse is more a curse than a blessing: While it enabled me to study relentlessly, it also made me completely forget how to study sober, and forget how to find motivation to study sober.I also hated taking it because of the extreme depression during a comedown. That feeling absolutely terrified me, and I realized I would have to quit using Vyvanse altogether the following year (third year university) if I wanted a chance at regaining the ability to study sober.

FOURTH YEAR OF DEPENDANCY - QUITTING

  Going into my third year of university, I carried that feeling of a Vyvanse comedown with me and used it to motivate me to study sober. It mentally scarred me, and it was enough to keep me sober through the whole first semester. My acne completely cleared up, I look healthier overall and I’m rarely very sick. The feeling of the Vyvanse comedown was/ is enough to motivate me to study a bit every day and keep up with my schoolwork rather than leaving all of it till last minute when 20 other things are due. I can feel myself getting happier as my serotonin/ dopamine receptors recover from years of abuse by Vyvanse. Slowly but surely, I’ve noticed my body recovering from absolutely relentless abuse of Vyvanse. 

   Even though this is the first semester of university I’ve ever done completely sober, my grades are considerably better than previous years- Proof that Vyvanse doesn’t make you smarter or increase your work ethic, it just allows you to stay concentrated while studying, with no breaks- the trade-off is the absolutely horrible comedown, not worth experiencing if you can help it. 

FINAL THOUGHTS

   I didn’t realize exactly how badly Vyvanse affected me and my life until I took a step back and looked at the whole journey from the first dose to my last - and all I can say is I’m surprised I survived this long. I don’t know how I survived over 2 years of pulling 2-4 all nighters per week on Vyvanse- luckily I pulled out due to the immense horrible feelings of a comedown before I did any serious damage. My scalp still shows in places where I excessively picked at it while on Vyvanse, my memory is slowly improving although still damaged and I generally feel less sadness every passing day- all long-term effects of years of Vyvanse abuse. 

   There’s memories I missed out on that I’ll never get back, but moving forwards I know I’ll remember the feeling of Vyvanse and the comedown for as long as I live, and all of the important things I learned from abusing a drug that I thought would make me “smarter”. 

  Vyvanse played such an integral role in my life, both good and bad, but mostly bad. Without it, I probably wouldn’t have gotten into my university program of choice, and would miserably be retaking high school courses to raise my grades. But abusing Vyvanse as often as I did also prevented me from meeting people in university and caused me to isolate myself, missing out on things I’ll never be able to experience again. It also placed a HUGE strain on my relationship with my boyfriend. 

   So, if you’re a student at any educational level considering taking Vyvanse to study or for general curiosity/ fun, remember my story and everything I had to go through in order to regain my ability to study sober. I’ve forewarned you, don’t get caught up in the Vyvanse cycle because it, like any other dependence/ addiction, is unforgiving, cruel and has massive effects on both your personal and social life. Use my mistakes and learn from them, so no one has to go through what I went through for 4 of the most difficult years of my life.

   If you’re currently struggling with Vyvanse addiction, feel free to shoot me a message- as someone who’s been through it I’ll try to help you in any way I can.",60

I am off Adderall now but I also was on a low dose of Klonopin and really wanted to taper off that before starting rehab based on the risks of stopped too quickly for Benzos.

Well, I’m well ahead of schedule getting off Klonopin. So it looks like I could start rehab before the end of December.

I called the rehab I have been communicating with and had the best intuitive feeling (as welll as more rational/logical thoughts in favor of) which is an lgbt rehab that is pretty established or rather very established and in -network with my insurance.

I’m a little anxious to fly out to a state I’ve never been to before where it will be snowing (I grew up in CA so it can be a bit gloomy adjusting to “real winters”) and hand over so much control , but I’m gonna do it. I’m kind of looking at this rehab as “the one I’m least anxious about”,  but I also have a feeling once I’m there I will really be glad I went as I’ve always thrived being in immersive environments when working towards Any type of goal.

The rehab is pretty accessible and everyone seems friendly and patient yet it also seems very reputable and solid in terms of quality of services and treatment and facilities/amenities if you will. 

I’ve had some phone conversations with admissions people at other rehabs who have had such attitudes that I would truly characterize those experiences as triggering. But I appreciate that this one is practical in terms of being thorough in checking my insurance benefits and being transparent about all that. 

It’s gonna happen and happen relatively soon (again it appears I’ll star Dec 27th), but this would be essentially my first time in rehab , and I find myself craving mantras and platitudes or what not leading up to it. I guess because I feel like I will get out of rehab what I put in, so I want to make sure in a good mindset to really commit to whatever treatment/work is in store.

Anybody been to rehab and remember their “first time”, particularly what their expectations were vs the real experience of it?",7

I think it’s actually good to a certain extent bc it’s a relatively harmless distraction from some of the post-Adderall depression and anhedonia I am dealin g with. 

But I know it could start becoming a thing that I just get carried away with, and maybe start posting things soooooo silly and soooo frequently, that I begin to start developing anxiety from thinking “why did I post that!?” 

And I’m also just trying to think of a better way I can channel it, even if it means something only slightly different, like blogging or doing some type of creative social media project out of this energy I have, as a lot of the posting I’ve been doing is just random philosophizing about random memes and popular culture stuff, or editing memes or other internet-y photo/video/etc posts.

Don’t have a specific question but would of course be curious to hear others chime in about how social media activity fits into their lives w/r/t stimulant usages or abstinence, and people’s experiences in trying to channel that energy elsewhere or more productively/constructively. 

I’m navigating this with the impression/feeling that I really just happen to enjoy and get a kick out of social media, but of course even if my personality does simply predispose me to playing around on social media/the internet more than others, there’s always a line where anything can become too much, even if it naturally fits into my personality and more comfortable ways of finding diversions or expressing myself and communicating with others.  I do definitely believe IRL/in - real -life engagement and activity is healthier for me Personally when appropriate opportunities for that are available.

I sincerely have had ADD issues my entire life... began taking adderall in college like most to cram for tests/papers... than my gf (now wife) started giving me some daily for work and eventually got my own prescription.

Fast forward about 8 years and I find that adderall has significantly diminishing returns...  I have been stuck in this vicious cycle of taking 30 MG adderall.. than smoking a shit ton of pot to deal with the negative side effects (inability to sleep, eat, feeling nautious, dizzy, my stomach hurting, chest hurting late afternoon as I begin to crash etc...).  I try not to take it on the weekend so I can ""recover"" but find that I am completely useless and lethargic... with a 2 year and 4 year old I often feel like life is passing me by...

So this week when my prescription ran out I said EFF it... enough is enough and am now on day 4 with no adderall.  To help combat this... I also have quit smoking weed.

However, I literally can't get ANY of my work done and feel almost like stomach sick between withdrawal and huge consumption of caffiene to offset my lethargy...  I literally fell asleep drinking a redbull on the couch this morning for 2 hours when I was supposed to be working (I am in sales and work from home when not visiting clients which is a big reason I became so dependent on adderall... to help me focus on work while working from home with chaos of my kids/wife around me).

Anyways... I am convinced I need to quit adderall for my greater good... but am I trying to take too much on by also significantly reducing weed intake (quitting use during work week)?   

I am starting to feel like I should take one thing on at a time... first get over my adderall withdrawal... than worry about reducing my weed intake..  i find weed sometimes helps me concentrate initially until I ""come down""... in which case I feel twice as foggy as before... but 2 hours of work is better than 0.

Anyways I feel helpless and really strongly don't want to go get my RX re-filled as I have already realized I don't have the self-control necessary to ""taper off"" as they put it...

I was getting Concerta and 10mg ir per day after an adult diagnosis and it was helping me a lot. One day.. I thought wonder what will happen if I snort some. Apparently it feels like cocaine. So I do and I'm so happy, talkative, productive off just 10mg.

I was only getting 54mg ER and 10mg IR, every 28 days.

 From the VERY FIRST TIME I tried insufflation it became a daily thing. 

I was taking about 30mg snorted a day for a few months on top of 54mg ER, then it increases, as soon as I run out I start taking the ER stuff apart which is gunky and doesn't work as well (a waste really).

By about June I'd use my entire 28 day IR script in 2-3 days. I felt like shit doing this, basically an anxious mess. I was not productive, every time I'd say ""this is my last pill for today"" but it never was. At the end of every day ""I'm taking it as prescribed tomorrow"".

I start running out a week before it's due, I steal my partner's script and leave her short. I lie to her face about it. Eventually I can't do that without suspicion so I have to take a week off before my script. The worst thing is I feel so good in the weeks off! I start eating, drinking, being social. When I'm on this stuff I lock myself in my room and don't talk to my girlfriend at all for days on end. I tell her it's just my depression.

Eventually I had an appointment with the specialist and I convince him to lower my ER to 36mg and up to IR to 3x a day. So now I'm getting 840mg of Ritalin IR a month. The binges increase and I start feeling shit. I ran out three weeks before it was due last month and in that 3 weeks I recovered and felt somewhat human again.

As soon as I got the script though (Thursday) I did my biggest binges ever. 166mg on day 1, 226mg on day 2, 186mg on day 3, about 130mg day 4, and today 156mg. I have about 15 pills left to last until January out of 84. I tell myself I'll take these as prescribed but I would be surprised if they lasted 2 more days.

I would be less concerned if I was enjoying myself and being productive on them but I'm not... I literally sit still as a rock in uncomfortable positions, jumping at every tiny noise of the pipes or every movement. In a state of paranoia. Yet I still keep redosing and I've not been eating.

I am starting to think that I can't be trusted with a ritalin script at all. No matter how much I tell myself I'll use it properly I never do, it's always ""I'll snort one pill to pep myself up today"" and once I pop I just can't fucking stop railing them every 30 mins. I never thought I'd get into dangerous territory but I am pretty sure 200mg of ritalin in an 8 hour period is not fucking safe. I know some people do massively higher doses than that but that doesn't make it okay.

All in all feeling pretty disappointed in myself that after about 2-3 weeks clean, feeling alive again, as soon as I got my script I decided to fucking waste it all again and cause unknown stress to my body.

You know this drug was supposed to help me, and it did until that first line. I can't believe it's been a year, I really want to go back to taking it properly but I say that every month. It's always one line. I say one can't hurt I'll control myself, the fact is I can't control myself because after that line my judgement is impaired to the point that doing 10 more seems like a great idea and the guy that said just one line is an idiot who doesn't know what he's talking about.",2

My curiosity may have been sparked by that movie with Robert DeNiro I believe.

The one that always jumped out at me was how I believe many with Parkinson’s have difficulty with initiated certain movements or behaviors,
But once they get started, the follow through on the movement or behavior was much closer to normal. 

I would even relate it to some childhood behaviors—I could be a bit physically lazy, but then very active once I resolve the “volition” part or got going. 

For example, I gravitated to the jumping events in track and field. Where it’s kind of a simple and repetitive act, where u really just gotta get revved up then let it fly. I was not quick so not really built for long and triple jump, but gravitated and excelled at it nonetheless.

Anyway, not that I’m off Adderall, I feel sluggish, and I do think a lot about the idea of “initiating activities” is wayyyyy harder than the following through part. BUT I also think that self-starting does pull from a finite source of energy to a certain degree, and that structure is important to get started in stayin active and also social surrounding or other external things that help you get going are crucial and you can’t sustainable just self start through everything.

I’m rambling. But with regards to my two suggested solutions to this “slowness initiating movements or activity”—external social pulls/encouragements/incentives, as well as planned structure in advance—i would love to hear tips and suggestions along those lines as isolation is a big concern for me and i am taking time
Off my school program to do this beginning part of my abstinence so will be looking for structure while being realistic about my diminished battery power right now.",11

I am really struggling. I've been in recovery for 9 months. It's been hard for me to get any length of time sober. I did make it to 47 days once, then relapsed at the beginning of November. Since then, I haven't been able to stay sober for more than a few days. I've relapsed several more times, mainly on adderall, each time getting worse and worse. Things are really not good. 

I had a relapse last week that was like 4 days, then I was sober for 3 days, and now I'm on the 4th day of yet another relapse. My tolerance shot up so fast. I started taking adderall on Thursday afternoon and my last dose was at 10am this morning. In total I have taken 720mg. 

It's bad. I feel like I may never sleep again. I am surprised my body hasn't just given up on me, it feels like it might. 

The urge to try and keep this going into oblivion is strong. I don't think I can endure much more and at this point I'd have to take like 400mg to get high. I can't do that. 

I feel all kinds of fucked up, my brain, my body, it's all fucked. 

It has all gotten so out of control. I have missed around 14 days of sleep over the past 6 weeks. I am just running myself into the ground with this shit. The addict part of my brain is in full-swing at this point, like I'm not thinking right at all. It's like I'm back in active addiction, which I guess I am. 

I have been waiting for about 3 weeks to hear back from a place about residential treatment. I hope they call me this week. I hope they decide on inpatient. I hope it works out. 

I do not feel good. I feel like I broke myself. It's taken me hours to write this.

I was introduced to meth when I was 19 ; I had guys constantly trying to get me to do it but I said no for about 6 months. I finally said ""fuck it"" because I was so angry all the time. My mother would take more than half my paycheck (1200$/mo at the time) and I would sleep on the floor in the living room. She was mentally abusive all my life but I thought that if I helped with bills maybe she would love me. I started to go to community college and she would take my books and supplies and hide them because ""I needed to work, not go waste time at school"" that basically ruined my financial aid. I would constantly wake up to her hovering over me because I slept with my wallet next to me. At some point she decided that I didn't need a phone and pawned my first phone I purchased with my own money. 

All that to say ""fuck it"" I went to a guys house and I didn't know it was going to be there. The guy tried to tell me it was wax or something and I didn't believe him but ""fuck it."" 

The problem is that all of my worries and heartache melted away. It was temporarily not there. I'm 30 now, I've managed to be sober for about 6 years total on my own but the rest are intermittent relapses.

Of course I took that initial hit all those years ago but people that love themselves don't do shit like that and I struggle with loving myself today. My last bout of sobriety was almost 7 months about a month ago. At this point I know that being in recovery is tough and I struggle to find a reason to add yet another difficult task to my life when all I have known is strife.",14

Each day has been different. Reminding myself abstinence and the physical recovering is unpredictable and often nonlinear.

Dealing with a medication (Adderall mostly) I took on a daily basis for quite some time and at some times extreme extreme doses, so there’s a long road ahead, but I’m glad I sometimes have “good thoughts” like “wow, you’ll feel so proud when you hit 3 months, 6month, etc”

Honestly, the milestones are gonna he important for me bc I know based on my history and based on research I am not going to feel physically much better for a long long time, so I’ll need to derive some reward from those milestones almost like the “placebo effect”

Not sure if I’m wording this in the most relatable way, but I’m definitely in a “Ok, you gotta reinvent yourself a bit during this time!” In that I truly am adjusting to a new reality. 

I didn’t always abuse Adderall for “pleasurable” reasons, so there are a lot of general and practical lifestyle changes I need to make.

As well as finding new (or in many cases, reacquainting myself with old!) hobbies and passions and leisure activities.

The other big things I’m trying to focus on are structure, sports, and socializing.

Structure because no matter how much progress I make one day, and how inspired I am when I go to bed, there’s a good chance I’m gonna be drained when I wake up the next day. Sometimes the hair part truly is initiation or getting going (other times every passing minute is unbearable), but with structure I’ll have something waiting for me when. I wake up that hopefully I look forward to on some level and gets my butt up off the bed or couch.

Sports bc paradoxically I became so sedentary and binge ate so much I gained so much weight but depression makes it hard to exercise via health or vanity motivation. But I’m lucky through trial and error I realized I still enjoy sports for the competition, adrenaline rush, teamwork and trash talk haha, everything. So doing sports based exercise I hope will keep me physically active and exercising.

Socializing, so so so important. If I didn’t have to read and could just verbally converse to access info and communicate, I wouldn’t be needing Adderall. Socializing is mode where my brain doesn’t feel broken. Of course socializing in contexts where I can talk about things that are actually meaningful to me and with people with whom it makes sense to invest time into.",19

2019-12-05 18:03:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/e6pceg/my_massive_overdose/,My massive Overdose,"Hey,
 
So you might remember I wrote a post a couple of days ago on how/and if I can beat this. As I mentioned there I had just started using after 4 months clean. I had just started a new job, and in my mind working without amphetamine was impossible.

Just 4 days after starting again I did something completely reckless which almost cost me my life.  

I was using speed paste which was wet.(In Europe speed is typically sold as a wet paste) My 5 gramm baggy was empty, save for the paste stuck to the sides. It didn't look like that much so I thought what the hell and dipped the baggy in a cup of water and stirred till their was nothing stuck to it anymore.

You can probably see where this is going...

I then proceeded to drink the cup. I remember stopping half way through and thinking this tastes like a lot of speed, maybe I should drink the other half later. Sadly I didn't.

Before we proceed I should mention that I was currently at my mum's.

So I was browsing Reddit and started to feel the come up. It was getting more and more intense by the minute and I started feeling better and better. 

 Then all of a sudden she came over for a quick chat. This made me very uncomfortable since I get really anxious around people when I'm speeding. I told her I wanted to take a nap, and she left me be. As expected when she came over I became very anxious, after she left the anxiety seemed to linger which was odd. Then it started becoming more intense, slowly at first, then faster and faster. My heart started pounding out of my chest, I felt dizzy and kind of spaced out, their was this powerful feeling of impending doom and I thought this just might be it. For a moment I felt strangely at piece with that. Then I snapped back to reality, at this point an unimagenably anxious hell. My left chest started feeling numb and this numbness started spreading throughout my body. Then my arms started shaking uncontrollably.

It dawned on me that this wasn't a panic attack. I had just accidentally ingested a potentially lethal amount of amphetamine and urgently needed medical attention.

Their was only one Problem. I really didn't want my mom to know what was happening. She wasn't aware I use speed and I planned on it keeping it that way. The thought of her finding out horrified me and doing so by seeing me overdose was beyond horrifying.

So while I'm spun out of my mind, pacing back and forth, with a completely scrambled brain I try to figure out what to do. My thoughts start to drift towards death.
 I thought of the cold pale face of the man whose heart had momentarily stopped while he was at our house. He looked horrifying.
 I thought of the pain it would cause my loved ones.
 I thought of being forever known as that guy who died from to much speed. 
Finally I thought of all the things I hadn't had the Pleasure of experiencing: falling in love, having children, feeling deeply content with life itself. I've always had my doubts if existence is worth it, but in that moment I wanted to live more than ever before.

So I summoned the courage to finally come clean to my mom.
She handled it surprisingly well and promptly drove me to the ER.

The first couple of hours in the hospital where st terrible but at least I felt somewhat safe. While I was still incredibly agitated the doctor began to lecture me on how dangerous amphetamine is and warned that I wouldn't be alive much longer if I kept going. After a while they started continually giving me benzos since my agitation wouldn't stop. Who would of thought that 1mg lorazepam wasn't enough? Finally after 5 or 6 pills I started to calm down. I was still very out of it, everything felt funny and wherever I looked the colours where  vibrant and bright. After a while I actually felt pretty good. Which in hindsight isn't that suprising, being on lots of amphetamine and lorazepam. I just layed awake all night feeling totally content.  They kept watching me since my BP and Heart rate where still through the roof. As the night progressed my vital signs slowly went back to normal and in the morning they finally released me.

Back home I figured out that I had accidentally ingested about a gram and a half at once

This was a wake up call for me. If I keep doing speed I will eventually slip up again and might not be so lucky. Thankfully I'm going to rehab in about ten days.

I wouldn't advise doing speed but if you must always, always weigh out everything you take, even if it seems small. Trust me an amphetamine overdose is a TERRIBLE experience. I still have flash backs of it from time to time.

 Better safe than sorry",36

Basically, the first month consider yourself useless. Between feeling like a slug, depressed, tired, uncomfortable and then you’ll have a good few days then feel like shit again and it’ll start to feel like you were better off just not quitting at all. I felt like that around 50 days. I think it’s part of my brain healing and being like “hey girl, thanks for giving me space to heal- now hand over the goods” so you’ll have to remind yourself.

Not a day has gone by where I haven’t thought about it, but it’s changed from I wish I had my adderall to ‘holy shit, I seriously was just in the zone for 30 mins and felt like I had taken an adderall” and wow that was foundational to me because it reassured me I’m capable of achieving that focus I thought was impossible to gain without drugs.  It was a fleeting moment, followed by the usual depression.  But, each week those fleeting moments get longer. And now, I can smile and laugh and actually set my mind on something and do it. Yeah, there are shitty days but seeing the progress I’ve made it amazing.

Every time I do a stupid, reckless stimulant binge, it feels like I've reset my brain.

I've done such absurd dosages and managed to not overdose or  seriously hurt myself, that the second I'm high I enter into the delusional way of thinking that I just can't overdose, that I can't hurt myself.

(I'm in no way implying that I haven't done any mental or physical damage to myself btw, or that i'm not close to getting mental of physical damage, more just that I haven't been aware of any so far)

This was just kind of a ramble of thoughts but it's what I've been thinking about lately. It all feels so ""smooth""  and ""safe""  while I'm in the middle of it all, but now looking back I can see how often I've binged in the last few months, and how much I dosed in those binges and it's a little disturbing because I simply wasn't aware this was a problem. I felt no physical pain, no horrible depression or anything to kind of slap me in the face and snap me out of it.

So it just keeps feeling really easy and tempting. Cravings come to mind in the form of what feels like an original thought, like ""oh it's been long enough, I was fine last time, this is a good time to do it anyway"",  and then I wait 15 minutes and the thought is gone and I realize that wasn't really me thinking that.

also; wasn't sure where the line is drawn for what is considering triggering content so I flaired as triggering content,  I hope this was the appropriate thing to do",23

I also knew my dad would eventually figure it out and I’d have to deal with that fallout. But I did it anyway. I really just wanted to feel some sort of high again.

My friend told me about this thread and thought my experience would provide some hope for those trying to get off of stimulants. I hada helluva time and just reading about others experiences helped. 

A little background: 

I started misusing substances in 8th grade, starting with alcohol and weed. I am from the northeast and in my senior year of high school (2009) opiates really started infecting my little suburban oasis. I got hooked and the summer leading in to college I stole money from my workplace. I went to school and was placed into protective custody 3 times in the first 2 months of the semester and was subsequently politely asked to leave, I obliged. I went home and kept doing opiates and kept drinking, quickly accumulating 2 DUIs. I was put on random drug testing so I could only use drugs that stayed in my system for short times, or that I could manipulate into passing the test. 

*ENTER: ADDERALL*

I had done Adderall and other pharmaceutical stims in high school, but had never used them to excess the way I started to. I would purchase as much as I could find and binge for days on end, to the point where I would develop sores on my body, hear my name being called, and see shadows moving in my peripheral vision. 

During these binges, I would masturbate for hours on end (literally all night and morning if I had the opportunity) and sort various pornography videos into different playlists, all while using stims in every conceivable way except intravenously. I could feel my cognitive decline from the lack of sleep and nutrients. I could feel my brain rewiring itself- and not in a positive way. 

This went on for 4 years. I somehow finished an undergraduate degree in psychology and kept my job as a bank teller during this time. That said, I was not happy nor healthy. 

Eventually, I met a girl who would not put up with any of that, and managed to stop cold turkey. It was horrendously painful, as it always was when I ran out of my stash. But also freeing. A glimmer of hope. 

But that hope passed. Stimulants demand that you keep thinking of them. My sex drive was completely depressed. I was sad- there's no enjoyment in anything. I  was irritable. I felt hopeless. But I did not return to stimulants.

For months that gray haze laid over my and followed me. **I went through the motions.**

AND THEN

I started to enjoy things again. **This took probably 6-8+ months to happen.** The brain takes time to begin producing the neurotransmitters that the stimulant provided. I never thought it would take THAT long- even with my 3-4 years of pretty constant stimulant abuse. 

I found that attempting to work out helped a lot. If I could just get to a gym, I would feel better after a workout. Easier said than done, however. 

Eating healthy helped quite a bit as well. I have plant-based for a few years now, and my body responded in a really positive way. I can imagine if I started eating healthier (doesn't have to be plant-based!) during those initial recovery months, it would have decreased my recover time. 

Try to focus on something particular and put your energy towards that. It can be learning about something, cooking, a video game you really get into (if that is not a trigger), or an activity like working out. 

**I found that my mind still wanted to fixate on something- its okay to give in to that while your body recovers.**

Just be sure that the focus of your energy is something positive and not self destructive. 

I don't have great advice, just to hang in there and give your body time. It does recover. 

I am now in graduate school and holding down a new job that I love. It has been 4+ years since I had done a stimulant. 

Solidarity with you all",70

2019-12-01 00:05:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/e4b0mr/can_a_relapse_be_positive/,Can a relapse be positive?,"Hi all. In no way do I condone my behavior that I will speak about in this post. I am a very mentally ill 21-year-old. In no way am I recommending anyone else to mimic my actions to yield the same results. Please, stay sober. 

I discovered meth in march 2019 and we had a wild ride. 2019 as a whole has been the most insane year of my life. I got clean on august 25th. three days later, I was trying to find meth to relapse on, and settled for xanax, which I had never used before. I ended up getting in a very minor car accident (it’s a miracle I didn’t hurt anyone, hurt myself, or get a DUI). That car accident is responsible for my parents discovering my problem. I still live with my parents, and they said that I could either go to rehab or do “rehab at home” (read: be grounded lol) and I stupidly chose rehab at home. I started going to meetings on my thirty days of sobriety.

There is a tangible difference between sobriety and recovery. I was a dry meth addict for 90 days. I went to some AA meetings but never got involved and only shared when i had a birthday. I obsessed over meth. I ruminated about it every day. My behaviors remained unchanged. On my 90 days of sobriety, I went to a meeting, got my chip. They asked “how did you do that?” and I was actually honest; I said i’ve been white-knuckling this shit, I desperately need a sponsor. And I got a sponsor that night! 

However that night I got shit drunk and ended up in the sketchy part of town and relapsed on meth. And it was horrible!!!! I was so anxious I couldn’t stop grinding my teeth the high was like nothing how I remembered, but also exactly how I remembered. By ruminating and obsessing over it, I romanticized meth to the point where my drug of choice wasn’t even real. It wasn’t my savior drug anymore. I cannot hide behind my family’s ignorance anymore. The passage of time and my weak sobriety only made my obsession and romanticization grow and become even more powerful. 

Somehow though this relapse wasn’t detrimental... it was exactly what I needed. it was, in a way, completely fucking necessary. a painful reminder of this hell drug that I quit and abstained from for 90 days BY MYSELF. i need to take my recovery seriously instead of putting so much emphasis on sobriety. because sobriety only gets you so far. recovery is actually changing the ingrained behaviors in your life that are drawing u back to compulsion. I love you all and thank you for listening",16
