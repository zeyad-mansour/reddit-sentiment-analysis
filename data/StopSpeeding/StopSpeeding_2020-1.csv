This is my first time admitting I have a problem and it's absolutely terrifying. I don't know if I'm quite ready to quit just yet, but my addiction is becoming unsustainable and so I'm ready to start making a plan. 

Im prescribed 50mg Vyvanse and I've taken as many as 6 a day, but on average I'll take 2-3. I skip on weekends and still usually have at least 10 days without any at all before my next refill. For 4 years, I consistently took whatever I could get my hands on. Vyvanse, Adderall, focalin. At least once a day, if not more, for four years. Then I got the prescription, which I've had for about 2 years. I started doubling up about 6 months in. Then this past summer is when the serious dosing started. 

I genuinely believe that I could not do my job without it. It's mind - numbingly boring and soul crushing and the only thing that makes it tolerable is the Vyvanse. I've taken sick days, PTO, Dr appointments - anything I could think of to avoid work in the days before my refill and I just can't do it anymore. But I would like to at least give it a try. If I can't make this job work without Vyvanse then I'd have to make an entire career change and move a couple thousand miles back home because I couldn't afford to live in the city I'm in now. 

So I need advice and everyone's experience. 

How long should I take off from work for my initial detox? I know it's gonna be gnarly bc 150 to 300mg is outrageous. I was thinking 2 weeks? If anyone else has detoxed off a similar amount, what was your detox timeline like? (ie mood, energy, relapse thoughts, etc) 

Does anyone have any experience with making a career change to stay sober? What did you switch to and from? Did you have a support system? 

I'm just really scared to get sober because my entire life is going to change and I don't know how to prepare for that. 

But I hope this post is a good first step

Edit: I left this out, but it's kind of important: I actually do have ADHD - it went undiagnosed as an adolescent (as it often does) since girls exhibit different signs than boys do. Ideally, I would like to take my medication as prescribed, but I live by myself so I don't have anyone to dose it for me and I don't know how to dose myself (obviously) but if anyone has had any success with taking as prescribed, please let me know",14,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9804961085319519}"

I also quit gambling and nicotine after 10 years and it’s all getting better in my life. 

The first week was absolute hell, then it got easier. But now I’m finding myself craving adderall so fucking badly. I texted my plug today but he didn’t reply thankfully. I just don’t understand why 3 months later the cravings are more intense than ever and I’m wondering will it ever get easier? I’ve quit so many addictions this year and I know I need to.

But I’ve been using stims regularly for the past 3 years and I stopped recently, and I don’t know if I can really go back to the way I was before. 

It started when I was depressed and I saw my grades going down so I stole ADHD meds from family members and started using it once a week. Then my grades started improving and I became more productive so I started using every other day. 

I stopped recently because I graduated. And in a moment of stupidity or bravery I threw all my remaining stash into the trash and I said that I will never look back. 

But every now and then, I’d face some difficulties, and I’d think: wouldn’t it be great if I had kept some of those drugs? Or that I really need it now and I can’t do it without. Logically I know that’s not true, because I’ve proven to myself time and time again that I can function normally without drugs. Or I’d see something random and think of what a great time I had, even though I know that I was constantly anxious and restless and irritated and had a massive headache all the time.

I've always had a bit of a rocky relationship with adderall but it's always remained pretty well under control over the last 5-6 years.  After I finished undergrad and was working on fixing my depression I decided the stimulants needed to go for a while, and I was fairly good on keeping myself in check enough to cut way back.  Since about 2017-2018 I've wanted to be fully done with adderall and was resolved to be rid of it.  

Well that never happened, but it at least kept me in check for a few years.  Recently however, I began my PhD program and moved away from my fiance (temporarily) and something must have just clicked in me because my once meticulously monitored usage has absolutely exploded. I'm hitting daily totals of 150mg+ of amphetamine some days and have started using benzos to shut myself off at the end of the day, something I once hated the thought of.  That's not even to mention the fact that I broke one of my cardinal rules and tried a few doses of meth out of curiosity (way too tweaky for my tastes) which has now put me into the realm of not being able to talk to my good friends about it out of shame.

The thing is though from the outside, and even the inside, I'm doing better than I ever have before.  I achieved a 4.0 my last semester studying a subject I love, made a good group of friends in a completely new city on my own, have a wonderful fiance, a great research position that pays for school and more.  Even internally I feel better than ever; I'm hopeful, typically happy and my severe depressive phase ended a year ago with few signs of it returning even off stimulants. In the pursuit of excellence I let my ambitions cloud my judgement and allow me to disregard my previously set rules.  Except, the excellence did follow, and it was damn fun to do along the way.

At the moment I'm having a hard time reconciling my deeply held belief that I need to quit with the seductive devil telling me 'hey it's been working so far!' I'm fully aware that this is completely unsustainable in the long run (even the medium run) and I can feel some of the damage my use is doing to my body.  I guess I'm just rambling at this point but I just don't know how I went from being very committed to quit to not wanting to quit and hiding a heavy drug habit over the course of 6 months.

I am addicted to Dexedrine. I went almost 3 months off them due to abusing my prescripton last year, as detailed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/eausws/wait_a_few_more_weeks).

I got my new prescription Jan 8. And, as much as I had the intention to use it for therapeutic purposes, I know that chase for the euophira will win.

From Jan 8 to 10, I used 30mg (my prescribed amount). Jan 11 I used 40mg. Jan 12 I realised what was happening and went back to 30mg. Jan 13 to Jan 16 I used 15mg. Jan 17 I used 10mg. And now I am Day 2 Dexedrine free again.

I used Dexedrine for ADHD purposes from  July 2016 to March 2017 (exes prescription), then got my own prescription in November 2017. I know I will never get that confidence from Dexedrine again. The paranoia, fight or flight, isolation now occur on reduced doses. And, upon reflection, I was happy once I got past the first few weeks.

I am grateful for what I learned on Dexedrine. I meditated, took magnesium, and learned better ways to manage my time. But it also made me irritable, hypomanic, narcissistic, and sex addicted. I also learned that I am a childhood victim of trauma.

I feel like my 3 months sober is for nothing, but I know I only used briefly and mild doses. So, the withdrawal symptoms will be comparatively minuscule.

But you cannot connect with your heart on Dexedrine. It is an ego drug. When I check in with my Inner Child, he feels shaken up by the idea.

Will I use it for big tasks like moving and packing? I hope not. I feel that, after meditating, I can better activate the kind of thinking. And I know that it is a terrible habit to get into of waiting to do tasks on Dexedrine.

I have been using Adderall since 2015 and it has been a love / hate relationship. This drug takes control of me to the point where I neglect my health and chase the calming euphoria. I am trying to come up with a plan for quitting Adderall once and for all in 2020. But today I just have a simple question I would like to ask this community.

I believe that I have ADHD. I have a hard time focusing on tasks and I get hyperactive and obnoxious. My friend, who introduced me to Adderall, says that the dose that I was prescribed in the beginning was way too much and that I should not feel a ""high"" from a dose.

My current prescription is for two 20mg IR tabs a day. If I take even 10mg of Adderall (after abstinence) I most definitely feel a buzz and euphoria. It calms me and I enjoy it. BUT... with my personality, it immediately becomes a feeling I CHASE. I try to keep to a prescribed dose but sooner or later I ""want"" to ""feel more"" and I will break into my timer kSafe and take more. It's like immediately when I take a dose after abstinence it puts a spell on me. It alters my judgement and seems to almost mute my conscience.

I am journaling for my 2020 quit and I would like to ask everybody:

**Will it ever be possible for me to use a small amount of Adderall (not enough to feel euphoria after abstinence)  and enjoy its prescribed benefit after I have experienced the ""high"" and euphoria of taking more? Will I ever be able to have this substance in my body and not seek a high from it?**

I am really beginning to consider the idea that since I have experienced that high, I have burnt that bridge. I kind of feel like telling myself that a small dose (that I don't ""feel high"" from) would be possible for me to sustain is justification and bargaining from the addict tendencies inside me.

Bare with me here, (sounds generic)  Have you ever met someone you felt you've known your whole life? Because being content around them in every way is effortless. He is an amazing man he really is. But things weren't adding up. I set out to research as much as I could. The hiding, lying, symptoms, behaviors, ways it's consumed, detox, withdrawal...anything I could find. But personal stories on here of current or past users were the most helpful. For a while I couldn't decide if it was heroin or meth. But watching him detox at my house over 3 days (I live 2 hrs from him) and decided meth. Smoking meth, given what I'd found. We all know what I saw...it broke my heart. First I found burnt foils, the never ending sores on his hands, arms, neck, face.. up for days then sleep for days waking just to eat. All of it. He destroyed his career, family relationships, and finances. Lately it has gotten extremely bad. He's being evicted by family over his use, he was arrested in my town I found out while here, theres no money, suspended DL... So I get on truthfinder etc, pull a credit report (no that's not legal), pulled up arrest records, any public records or court paperwork I could get my hands on. And I'm not sorry for it. He is ex military, had an amazing career, owned a beautiful home, several cars etc paid in full... then about a little over a year ago began the decline. There's literally a paper trail for everything if you know where to look. He's been crying a lot (sobbing) yet he wouldn't tell me. But then he had his father order him pizza from another state because he had no money and was hungry. At that moment...I was disgusted, it broke my heart to see him that low. He would drown me with him if something didn't change. I brought him to my house were I knew he would sober, the restlessness, sweats, chills, extreme sleep, extreme hunger, and thirst... I kept him as comfortable as I read how or possible. (I forgot the noose in his basement I've cut down twice and replaced with a love note) his sores were the worst I'd ever seen...the one on his throat so deep and infected. When he sleeps I put on a topical anesthetic and clean them then neosporin. But I had to talk to him...I've tried and tried in the most delicate caring ways. This time I wasn't nice. We both have children and I had enough. I laid everything out. I broke balls with little to no emotion. I offered to keep his dog, because he couldn't stay with me if he didn't get his shit straight, and most places won't allow a pet. He's going from upscale to homeless. He can't put my reputation or career in jeopardy. He cried and told me...actually admitted and talked to me, in detail, dates use, paraphernalia I asked about etc, he cried a lot... I didn't know what else to do other than tell him I love him and let him know I'm not going anywhere but that he has to try. I'm in love with an amazing man. Lately I only see flickers of him sometimes. But hes still somewhere in there. I told him about his dull eyes and sunken cheeks. Back to his house, his cousin came over, and we all talked, all cried at that point, and he said he would go to a 30 day treatment center... so, he is there tonight. I feel sleepless. From everything I've read he's got a hard road ahead of him. I've read relapses are common, and only he can truly choose to save himself. He was scared. I'm hoping he's strong enough to fight this. He's the most wonderful person I've ever met... but I met him at his worst (hopefully) or close to.. And now I have a snoring pup laying next to me in bed (I brought some of his shirts to comfort her with his smell) and all I can do is hope. If anyone in recovery has suggestions for me, I will take all I can get. If he does this he needs to get away from certain people, and I will answer every call or be there for every visit, whatever I can do. He's better than this. I know it and he knows it. But I'm scared. Because this is quite literally his own battle of life or death. And all I can do is watch.",3,{'infect': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9680752158164978}"

I convinced myself that I was making the most of my medication.
 Now I've only run my tolerance into the ground. 

People are giving up on me. They see a speed freak and have adjusted to treating me as such. My husband is tierd of picking up my slack and he has decided this is good time for him to be selfish too. He was never good in a crisis, I used to kick into overdrive and make things work.

 Once upon a time I quit addy because it changes my personality. It makes me less funny or warm or artistic. After I gave up I gained 30lbs a nightmare for me because my primary addiction is food. Binge and Purge. After I got pregnant I gained 50 more but never would touch any pill for my baby's sake. 

My husbands work was keeping him gone for 11 months on one month off. I was all . I was pregnant in school full time working part time and in treatment at the VA for depression, PTSD Etcetera. I made it all work I even house hunted alone and bought us a house at 8 months preg so our baby could have a decent home.

  I went into a life shaking post partum hell. I went back to addy to get going again. It was a better choice than suicide.  I panic when I gain weight. I ruined or lost most of my back teeth and my digestive system is shot. I thought addy was my solution. I said to myself I would use it as a recovery tool.

 Alot happened and now things.were.looking up for a moment. I came clean to him about my addiction and he has been slowly loosing patience and respect for me. He sees me suffering today but he had a bad day and he has prioritized himself. Slowly numbing himself to me. He always made me feel useless when I was depressed so this should come as no surprise. He is avoidant so I see him slowly blocking me out with all my unpleasantness.

 Today I went to see my uncle who I grew up with as an older brother. He is on the streets and smokes crack and he had to have a tracheostomy because his airway closed from a mass in his neck. Hubby won't even talk to me today after taking me to the hospital to see him. He interupts anything I say and wants an apology for my bad mood this morning. It has made the tidal wave of my panic attacks much worse.  He says I'm fucking ridiculous when I try to talk to him. He walks away any chance he gets.

 When the shit hits the fan he's out. 

I'm alone. 

I feel alone. When people interupt you as you speak it means they do not respect you and are not open to listening to anything you say. When your an addict your word might as well flow out of your mouth in the form of shit. 

 He interupts most of what I say and takes any chance to walk away from me. When your on a drug you wear a scarlet letter. Mine is A for Adderall. I am constantly saying I don't feel good and people are tired of me already. 

Help me please.

I've read a lot of post and can say I think I found a good place for help and support. Having no one to talk to about this is making me feel crazy and hopeless.

I'm 35 and I have 5 kids and started abusing Adderall about 3 and a half years ago. I successfully quit for almost a year when I found out I was pregnant with my 10 month old son but with such a demanding busy life and a lot of sleepless nights that come with being a parent I began taking them again. Not as bad as the first time, I eat daily and sleep at least 4 hours a night sometimes more. Whereas before I was up for days and barely ate. The first time I stopped taking Adderall I used kratom to get by. However I still use kratom daily along with the Adderall to help me not take as much and my tolerance to kratom has built up so it's not much use alone any longer.

I have a love/hate relationship with this drug. I love it because no matter how much the kids wake me up during the night I know I will be ok the next day and because it helps me to be productive most days. Also as a stay at home mom I don't get any me time unless I am able to stay up after all the kids are in bed for a few hours. I can not stand the feeling of being so tired I'm fighting to keep my eyes open and not being able to go to bed because well mom's just can't do that. And I get extremely depressed and mad at myself when the house is in disarray, and the laundry is piled up... I feel lazy. But I hate that my addiction is robbing my family financially. Don't get me wrong my kids don't go without or want for anything, I just feel like we could go on more family trips or eat out more often and feel more financially stable if I quit Adderall. And it changes me... My personality, I get very serious and quiet and trapped in my thoughts. My sober self is silly, happy and overall a positive person. My anxiety sky rockets often and I feel overwhelmed. And the hyperfocus that comes with Adderall abuse is the worst! Some days I get nothing done just bc I get like ""stuck"" googling stuff and shopping for random things on the web and I know I need to put the phone down and focus elsewhere but it's really hard and I feel guilty bc that's time I could be spending with my kids or being productive. 

Anyway overall I am a happier person in general when I'm not taking them, even knowing this I can't just stop taking them.. I quit for 5 days a couple weeks ago and I spent all my time miserable with no energy or motivation and I couldn't do it. I don't have time to be useless. Other than eating right, taking vitamins, exercise and sleeping how can I get through the withdrawal? I read about nootropics, has anyone successfully used this as a replacement?

I promise i can't remember when i was prescribed but i started on 20mg, probably coming up on a year now. I'm in the middle of appeals with SS for my disability hearing due to extreme anxiety and bipolar2 so i am not working, just living and video gaming...

I just turned 37. I’m a mom of twin boys who just turned 2 and I’ve been married for 5 years. For the past year I’ve managed to form an addiction to adderall. It started off so freaking innocent too. Ughh! My coworker and good friend had a connection to easily get some and I had taken adderall before in my 20s before here and there and remembered I liked it so I got some from him. Long story short, obviously I liked them a lot because it made me crazy productive at work, and more energy to take care of rambunctious toddlers (my husband and and I work opposite shifts for the most part so 80% of the week is basically single parenting and doing everything solo. Anyway, I had no idea there was this whole “withdrawal awfulness thing” if you stop taking it. I mean... I figured If I had to quit I’d probably suffer some physical symptoms of some kind but had no clue about the mental and emotional Hell that would happen as well. Call me a dumbass I guess. So here is where I need some major help and advice/tips....

Over the course of the year I went from 30mg a day to 90 a day (60-90 a day have been about the last 6 months). I hate this drug and have become obviously addicted so I cut off my connection to it so I could quit. I think oh this should be ok if I just taper and keep some pills to do just that. Literally, I kid you not, the day I cut off my supply is the day I find out my husband has been unfaithful. Ok so that was 3 days ago. I took 60mg each day just so I won’t completely have a mental/emotional breakdown. Today I only took 30mg. I’m having trouble determining if my emotional state and moments of complete depressive crying spells are from the relationship issues or pill withdrawal. I also have to make some serious decisions and plans on what the Hell I’m going to do about my marriage and what this means for me and my children, and still go into work and pretend nothing at all is going on so that I don’t lose my job on top of this all. I can’t take time off work because I won’t get paid and I am the main source of income and have to keep a roof over our heads. 

I have 10 pills left. Do I taper them somehow that will help lessen the effects of withdrawal? Or do I just cold turkey suffer through? I know I will have to deal with physical and psychological withdrawals no matter what from what I understand but I am trying to do this the best way possible so I can TRY to make some decisions about my marriage and family based off my actual feelings and not withdrawal psychosis. Dear God is that even possible? What do you recommend? Any vitamins that can maybe help too? I’m so freaked out right now.

The idea of having a free house and using alone scared me. I’m prone to paranoia, and there’s a couple of people that know my address and have issues with me. Both would be at least twice my size. I don’t know anyone I could call in the event of my house getting run through, but my bigger concern is sitting in my bedroom just paralysed by fear, like I used to. Watching the shadows behind the blinds and all that sort of thing. 

I’m getting better at not being afraid nowadays, but I worry about my ability to control my thoughts without anyone there. I’m certain it wouldn’t end well, because I get through a lot more shard when I know that my family aren’t around, and doing too much leads me to one of three things: working until I physically can’t, pure stupidity, or fear. 

I do wonder if my usage of other drugs is causing all that, rather than the stimulants. I’m now on 45mg dexamphetamine, and I’m not paranoid at all - but I’ve stopped waking and baking, which was pretty much what I was doing for the better part of last year. It’s frustrating because I’m fine when I’m only doing stimulants/benzos, and no questionable psych meds (Pristiq, Valdoxan, Seroquel) but I have a stash of weed... and a stash of Seroquel. Not sure what ket does to me in terms of paranoia - using that and meth makes me feel like I’m looking over my own shoulder - but I’ve got that stashed as well. I was recently diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, which can also cause paranoia, so I just don’t know. But being here, only taking meds and the occasional cone, seems like a smart move.

I feel like myself again.,"Hi all. I was prescribed a combo of Vyvanse and Adderall for the past decade.   
I wanted to make this post to encourage others, as others have encouraged me in the past. It's not easy, but it's something I know I needed to do because it was negatively effecting my health and life.   
 
It helped me get through a dark period of my life, and I'm a better person for taking this medicine  because it let me build a routine and a schedule. I'm employed, and stims made it easier to just power through a 9-5 office job. No doubt. But there is a rate of diminishing returns when it comes to drugs in general, stimulants are no different. For the past 3 or so years I noticed I was isolating myself from my friends and family. I wasn't eating right. I was drinking a lot of alcohol and smoking lots of weed to calm down at the end of the day. Wouldn't sleep well, rinse and repeat.   
  
My heart was just constantly racing, I knew the meds weren't helping me but I didn't know how to operate without them. What I did was let my prescription run out, and I shredded the prescriptions that I was going to fill so I had no access to the stims. The first days off the meds were the worst. I basically just slept for 48 hours.   
  
The first Monday back at work sucked, there's no sugar coating how fucking tired I was. I drank a lot of coffee. Tuesday was slightly better, but I was foggy as hell for about 10 days.   Then you start eating real food again, and actually exercising, and drinking less. Slowly but surely you can start to live a life off stims.   
  
It's obviously fun to be tweeking, but I'm starting to enjoy being comfortable in my own body again, a lot of my anxiety is gone and my thoughts feel clearer.  I honestly would say I am very happy I did this, but it really took me a long time to get to that point.     
 
I'm not hear to preach to anyone, because what worked for me won't necessarily work for you. I would say I ultimately benefited from the medication, but I should have tapered down my dosages sooner.  I don't really think about the drugs anymore, maybe once in a while when your tired, but I'll trade being occasionally being tired for feeling like I'm able to live my own life. I do feel much more free, but it really took me a long time to get to this point.   
  
I'm just here to encourage anyone who might be thinking about taking a break to tell you that it's possible, and it's very much worth it.",64,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9978969097137451}"

I dropped out of school 3 months before I could graduate to work in the oil and gas industry. I made 50k that year and didnt know how to spend money. I blame myself and no one else. I dropped out to help my family. I had already been doing hard drugs since I was 14 mostly cocaine because I'd gotten my first job at 13. Anyway you can imagine what happened once I was making 2200 every two weeks 🤣. I was getting da OZs haha! I was hot shit I thought I had it all I had a girl who loved me my best friends were plugged up and it was good for everyone for a time. I gained weight I was happy I was working hard. I ended up losing my girlfriend because I didn't wanna stop doing drugs and move to live with her like I promised for years. I was cheating behind her back. I didnt have a car stupid shit you know.. I ended up losing my job because I failed a piss test went through 3 grand doing cocaine in 3 months got another job went hard for awhile got my shit together and I was still getting fucked up on the weekends... ofc I'd call into work sometimes. I really would get depressed about my ex and I would just get so fucked up and send her pictures of stupid amounts of drugs.... I feel really stupid because I was putting on an image that I know in my heart wasnt me. I was just stupid petty and a legendary dumbass. Anyways my biological father ends up talking to my sister and getting ahold of me I'm still like 19ish at the time... I didnt wanna talk to him because I had a HUGE amount of love that turned to hate because I felt let down that he couldn't be in my life because he was involved with drugs and didnt pay child support. How was I supposed to relate when I'm holding a job fighting my demons and trying to help my family out. My stepdad had ended up getting cancer when I was 15 and that's when I realized here's a man who would stop at nothing to give us what he thought we deserved. I'm no saint I'm nothing compared to my father I'm hateful petty vengeful stupid and I let him down because I was weak... I seen this man battle stage 4 cancer and I couldn't be around him I masked my sadness with drugs because I felt weak and disconnected because I wanted money and I was greedy and I thought hes not gonna die hes ok? And he didnt die not then he died from a broken heart years later when his family failed him when he thought he had failed them.... anyways I didnt talk to my biological father because I hate a lot of hate for myself and respect for my father. So after losing the girl I lost my biological dad to murder he got killed and it hit me heavy I was still acting like a kid playing games and taking the gravy train living at home being a burden then 3 months later my father committed suicide. I couldn't believe it how had I made the same mistake pushing people off not checking on their mental health and being blind to what's happening. I was using drugs the entire time never got clean and my only motivation was drugs and money. I cry everyday because I failed the man that did so much for me I'm so hateful I never wanna forget how much pain I feel I wish I could feel it 24/7 because nothing else gives me motivation now.   Ofc there was also a lot of compounding factory's in all to this but I thought I was doing a pretty good job I think I did decent I dont regret losing my girlfriend because fuck that bitch I just wish I ran of with her and quit doing drugs and helped my family out more with money and quality of life things...

Hey guys, I’ve made a couple posts before when I had gone overboard and felt the need to type for an hour and post it on here. I’m gonna try to be a little shorter this time but I just did a nice shot so cut me a little slack. Also gonna put a super quick summary at bottom. 

Quick background: Addicted to opiates from very young age - got clean at 16 and stayed clean for 2 years - graduated to heroin and burnt my life to the ground over a couple years - Summer 2019 went to rehab then moved to a sober living house close to home then relapsed after 60ish days and used for about a month. - Oct. 2019 rehab again but this time moved to a sober living house in brand new city and state.

Cool, so we made it this far in two paragraphs. Okay so things were fucking awesome here when I moved in, the guys were close and we all hit meetings and did fun shit while we stayed clean. Recovery was actually pretty dope, then the holidays came around and a couple people relapsed and left and new crowd came in and they weeded themselves out. I tried meth for the first time early December but kept it hidden very well. By Christmas our huge house was at 5 out of 12 people. Unfortunately 4 out of our 5 people are getting high and feeding off of each other. I’ve slipped into my old ways and I might be worse off than before. Currently shooting somewhere between a half G to a gram of ice a day. Obviously that sends me to the stars so I’ve gotta come down. So I top it off with ole faithful, have gotten up to about a gram a day of H again. I feel so fucking guilty. 

Last paragraph, I promise.  Guilt is such a double edged sword. Damn it, I use to get rid of the guilt and by using I create more guilt. At this point I’m lost guys. I want to be clean and I want my friends to make it as well because god knows I’ve lost enough people to this disease. But at the same time my veins crave that next one, anything that makes me feel differently. Then I get sick and desperate and become the middle man/small time dealer for the guys in the house. I’m such a fucking hypocrite. A couple sentences above I said I’ve lost enough people to this disease already but two fucking nights ago I got some killer shit and sold it my closest friend at the house and watched him OD. Thankfully I always keep narcan and always use the buddy system for shooting H because I’ve been on the other side of an OD, I had to hit him 3 times but he came to and straightened out relatively quickly. I’m just fucking lost, I feel like the biggest hypocrite possible. Like I’m the bad guy that desperately wants to do good but can’t change anything. 

Maybe I lied, this really is the last one and it’ll be real short. So now that I’ve put a fair amount of my business out there, do any of my lovely reddit family have any ideas or tips to start cleaning this mess up. Any input will be much appreciated. Thank y’all for reading this drawn out dramatic shit show that I call my life. 



SUPER SHORT SYNOPSIS - 2 years clean - relapse on H for 3 years - destroy life - rehab - 60 days then relapse for couple months - back to rehab - move to new city - start enjoying recovery with new friends - holiday stress - relapse on h and ice- still in sober living house with close friends that are also using - I’m a hypocrite because I want to be clean and want them to be clean but I still use and get them shit too - need advice to fix this before it’s too late.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9847958087921143}"

I was able to wait as long as I wanted, without ever thinking about it or craving it. I was easily able to use without binging. 

Everything changed when I discovered masterbation/sex on stimulants. That's what led me to binge and use repeatedly. 

Now I've found that I get really strong stimulant cravings when I actually just need to have sexual release. It's kind of funny actually. Right after an orgasm, the cravings dissapear and I can laugh at having them. This might work differently for different people but for me this has been a lifesaver;  even when I'm dead set on using and already have a supply, I think ""first fap"" , telling myself I can just do it after and fap again. But the second I'm done I realize what was happening and don't want to use it anymore. 

Of course the cravings can come back in time but I'm only recently seeing how closely it's woven together with sex. A month or so during my most frequent and intense abuse I would fantasy about doing stimulants every time I got aroused. Now it's just once a week or something.

It's utterly fucking horrifying. I've tried my hardest to quit and even in the new spot I'm in I'm afraid I will go back to it again further creating this fuckery of homlessness, crime and bullshit.

I am a 23 year old who used to always make eye contact and could walk up and talk to anyone but over the last 2 years I’ve been abusing stimulants and I feel like everything has changed and I need help fixing it from somewhere else other than with my family because them finding out and worrying would only make things worse. I started off taking 30s of addy everyday and progressively jumped to 50 within a couple months with no ill effects. It was awesome and I truly believe I have ADHD so I justified using it to do small task like cleaning my apartment and to increase stamina for sports. I was buying from college friends so the supply was always there and I didn’t mind paying for it because I knew my parents would never approve because they hate pills. Once I moved back home, the stimulant craving was still there but not the supply so I felt like I had to make the most of what I had by taking them on an empty stomach and not eating until I was ready to go to sleep which was 100-150 mgs a day later sometimes more. I also caught myself always waiting to do things until I had stimulants which wasn’t healthy. It finally got bad enough to where other habits popped up to keep the high “alive”  like cigarettes or constantly vaping and then eventually caffeine like soda with either energy drinks or 5 hour energies. I hit a point where i felt like I had to  relieve myself with porn just to go to sleep every night and the comedowns the next day would be so filled with anxiety and depression that I wouldn’t even want to see my family. This only made me feel worse because I love them and enjoy being with them but I felt my anxiety was so bad they’d notice and suspect something. I finally decided to quit cold turkey and stayed off it for a month but I had no energy or drive still and had to start back up because it was taking a toll on my job and life. I know I have the ability to quit but it’s hard having to beat this alone and not being able to tell the people who usually help you what you’re going through. I’ve been having terrible comedowns recently which I have to reduce with either alcohol or hydros just so I don’t seem off.  I’m ready to stop again but was hoping for advice on whether it’s just the stimulant come down affecting me this badly or a mixture with something else or if anyone has any advice on kicking this for good because I’m so fucking tired of it being apart of my daily life.",21,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9979786276817322}"

{ I’m honestly surprised I’m even posting again on reddit, after the other day. I’ve came to realize the *internet and world* is full of arrogant and unforgiving assholes. Who don’t deserve to know mine or for that matter anyone’s story... My only hope is that maybe this helps someone who’s also struggling, and if anyone needs someone to talk to message me. I’d love to share my full story, but not to everyone, as I tried to do that four days ago, and was met with the rudest, most arrogant comments I’ve ever heard in my life. Ill try and reply as quick as possible, but between work and this extreme fatigue please allow some time..} 

    1) I’m a 19 years old *M*, I’ve abused drugs in general for the better part of 6 years. 6 months ago I was introduced to crystal meth, and made the absolute worst decision of my entire life. 

    2) I snorted a line smaller than one inch, and from there went into a full blown addiction. I changed from the sweet guy I formally was, into someone I didn’t even know. I met people who was so mean, cruel, and heartless, people I never knew existed on this earth. 

   3) I *thought that meth made me a better person, A harder worker, and easier to get along with*. That is a total lie in which your brain is lying to you. My ROA changed from snorting, to oral, then to smoking, and finally slamming. By the time I reached IV, I was a goner... I see it so clearly now. 

   4) I’m so angry, really I’m just pissed at myself. The withdrawal has been brutal, but nothing can compare to the self-hatred I have right now. **I lost everything**, 4K in savings wiped clean, a brand new vehicle that I had busted my ass for gone. EVERYTHING I had formerly gone in 6 MONTHS. I BEG anyone who’s considering this drug to RUN, anyone who’s still on this drug PLEASE stop using and get help. 

   5) Last but not least..., the only thing that was able to pull my head out of my ass has been my newly found girlfriend. I’ve known her for 4 years before we decided to become something more than good friends. This girl is for lack of a better word a savior. She has stuck by my side helping me beat this drug, and for the last 4 days I’ve been absolutely sure she’s had to think I’m crazy. Yet she assures me I’m not, understands it’s the withdrawal causing my mood-swings, and she stays by my side. She has a daughter who’s only 5 months old. The father completely out of their lives. 

   6) My only hope is that I can be the best father this girl could ever dream of having. I’m just your regular 19 year old, yet when I look into the eyes of this baby... It gives me purpose again in life. If it wasn’t for these two coming into my life I’d still be nothing. Even though it’s only been four days, things in my life have changed so rapidly. I’ve applied / am applying for new careers, and am currently working daily in construction.’The future looks brighter everyday, and even though there’s moments I feel absolutely hopeless and just wanna give up, these two girls are the reason I keep pushing on. Work has been extremely hard on me, as I feel so fatigued I just want to sleep, yet I feel I must earn a paycheck to help care for her kid, my kid. 

{ So to wrap all this up, you can beat this drug. I know I will beat this drug, because even on my worst days. My two girls are the reason I keep going. I refuse to let her have a drug-addicted father. I’ll probably delete later nonetheless though, Thanks for reading.}",8,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9978602528572083}"

I feel so safe and comfortable that it feels so easy to just use it again. I don't want to and I'm certainly not planning to, and I'm prettty proud of the fact that I'm able to resist it despite being around stims and occasionally around people that use it or have it, like festivals and clubs.

But yeah this is the part that really sucks. Everything goes back to normal, life gets easy, and the thought of ""why not?"" just keeps popping up in my head.

A few weeks later we got a new guy came to work with me at my job he happened to be a coke dealer on the side so i picked up a gram, and then another, then another. And so on. My girlfriend knew him as well, so the days i wouldnt pick up at work cause i was tired and my nose hurt i would come home and she had picked some up. This cycle went on from june until about 3 weeks ago, our seasonal work ended and we havnt done coke since.

We went on a road trip to visit family and it was amazing, until one day walking around a new city i stumbled upon the street where the drug market is. I got the urge and asked around for some tina. It was our last night there so why not get some for the 2 or 3 day drive back home that was ahead of us. It was too easy...picked up a G of meth and the next day we snorted a line and drive 6 hours to a hotel for the night and we smoked the rest. Then in the midst of the high I went on whisper in search of more, now most the time all you get is scammers responding. But not this time. Holt shit someone actually responded and they will meet up. We ask for a gram, this guy shows up and is feeling nice, he says it just over a gram. The next 3 days are spent smoking and driving and staying in hotels with about 2 hours of sleep a night. They guy gave us an extra .75 free.

That was the last time. For me, and i hope for my girl as well. We talked and agreed. We have a great life unfolding ahead of us, we want to start a family, we want to stop the drugs and isolation before they destroy us, i have gone this route in life before with drugs, starts off small and fun, then one day it wont stop and in a few months ill loose it all and have to start life over. I realized i dont need to know a dealer that now i know how to find it anywhere now, now i have the tweaker vibe.

I love my life, my job, my family, the money i make, my girl . Just all of it. Its too late for me to start over and be the man i want to become in life.  The train stops here im getting off before the last stop. Because i know what comes next. I know my family wont help me again, ill never find work as fufilling or profitable as i have now. Ill never be able to hold my future child. Il never have  that life i want unless i break this pattern. I have been to rehab, worked the steps, had a sponser, life coaches, support systems. All that jazz. Its time to open up the rusty took box and use them again.",21,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9795770645141602}"

plus, i often wonder how many people have a similar story

started snorting in April 2018, smoking in May 2018. my boyfriend & i loved what it did for us, it was like coke but so much cheaper and longer lasting. how cool, right? i remember in June he told me something like, ""you should be careful with this stuff...i can tell how much you like it.""

fast forward to May 2019. ive been using for a year now. the longest i'd gone without it was 10 days. i'm still a college student at this point although i had quit my job a few months prior. but this time around, i decide to shoot up for the first time. and then everything just falls down a steady incline until the very end. i never smoke or do a line or a hot rail ever again; it's just continuous shooting up until the last time I used, December 2019. (with a six week break in the summertime) dude, everyone always told me about how addicting the needle was, but fuck that, i never found the ritual addictive and i hated it. okay that's a lie... i loved the feeling i'd get when i saw blood from pulling back. i loved that acetone taste i'd get when i was almost done pushing it all in. i loved the feeling of trying to catch my breath after a big one. but i especially loved that warm feeling i'd get all over my body.

but even then, fuck this drug. i'm so over it. sure the euphoria is good for a solid two or three hours afterwards, but I was such a different person in those few hours. i was doing/saying shit i can't believe I'd do/say.

honestly, it was like getting barred out & doing a bunch of uncharacteristic shit. but with bars, at least you'd forget and the only way of knowing if it happened would have to be a third party. with meth, you remember it all.

i hate how paranoid shooting up made me. after that euphoric wave, it was just anxiety that plagued on your insecurities. i was always paranoid that my boyfriend and whoever else in the room was talking shit about me or making fun of me. it got to the point where i hated myself around other people after shooting up & i'd *need* alprazolam or clonazepam to chill me the fuck out.

shooting up almost ruined my relationship, my health,my life. i was 97lbs when i started. small to begin with, but i dropped to an almighty 83.7lbs. that's how little i weighed when i decided enough was enough.

my boyfriend & i almost broke up, even. we're so much better off without that horrendous shit. im so fucking grateful that we didn't allow it to destroy us — because it came SO close to tearing us apart. but now we're spending time on fixing the damage, and i love us & him even more now. 

fuckkkkkk shooting up meth, it can really destroy a person. honestly it has the power to turn Mr. Rogers into a paranoid rapist. that's how fucking wild it is. (**edit**: not that it *made me a rapist* or anything... it's just two completely different people. ya know? i felt like that needed to be said. lmao)


i have high hopes for my boyfriend's future, our future, my future, fuck it even your future! i don't plan on ever looking back.

**edit**: just wanted to add, aside from what i mentioned in a comment below, im still dealing with getting my shit together after getting clean in the sense that i can *feel* the long-term effects still lingering. sometimes i still get paranoid that my friends or family are saying things behind my back but i have to remind myself that im just being paranoid & push on. it's not easy but whoever said it would be was a fucking LIAR! to anyone reading this who is struggling to stay clean / wanting to get clean, stay hopeful because the light at the end of the tunnel is still shining for all of us.",28,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.985995352268219}"

Developed crippling anxiety issues, quit using, found relief through CBT.

As a result, my body can no longer tolerate amphetamine.  Even smaller doses in the 10-30mg range will cause lasting psychological issues.. waking up at 5:30am with panic attacks, 24/7 anxiety, severe brain fog, etc.

I had gone 1 year 3 months without any adderall. Finally started feeling sharp, witty, charming, ""on"" again.  Anhedonia was starting to fade, things were looking up.

Had some friends come visit, went out for NYE.. someone gave me 25mg worth and after drinking all night, I took it.

Now 2 days later, woke up this morning at 5:30am having a panic attack.  Freaking the absolute fuck out that I've destroyed all my progress, and it'll be another year until I start feeling normal again.

I've read that even 1 relapse can totally reset the  neurochemical healing process,

I don’t know whether I actually have ADD or am just experiencing withdrawal symptoms.  Could being on Vyvanse for 5 years make me feel like I have ADD when on off the medication?

I have an ADD diagnosis, but it was kind of a joke.  I was certainly there looking for a medication that would give me an edge.  At the same, I feel that I have some of the symptoms.  I can no longer distinguish between what is normal and abnormal.  

I didn’t take meds all the way through high school and was a good student.  I started taking for finals in college.  Then more regularly during law school.  And then finally everyday at work.  I feel like I have accomplished nothing of significance without being cracked out.  Its a terrible feeling.  I feel like a fraud whose life is a house of cards.  I really did myself a disservice by not developing the discipline needed to succeed and becoming reliant on a drug for motivation.  
 
When I am off the medication at work, I am horribly bored.  My comprehension is lower.  I procrastinate.  I can’t focus for long periods of time.  But this may be because I am so used to being on meds.  Maybe I just need patience.  I just don’t know.  But I do know that I loathe not operating at full capacity.  It’s frustrating when you’re levels of intelligence and functioning don’t seem to align naturally, but you can hit your peak when taking a horrible, addictive, personality-destroying drug.  

I may need to see a psychiatrist to find out what the hell is going on in my head.  I just want to live a normal life.  

I on my third day on Strattera and my 6th day of being off Vyvanse.  I feel like the Strattera helps some, so maybe I just need to be patient and accept that I can’t escape withdrawal altogether.  I must pay the price.",23,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.999442994594574}"

Now to do even better in 2020.,"I didn't decide to stop speeding entire, so I hope I can post this here. But my resolution for 2019 was to get my amphetamine use back to purely recreational use, and to stop using during the school/work week entirely. And I did it! I took me 9 months but I haven't done it once outside of a 24 hour Friday night to Saturday night block since September! I don't use it to self medicate anymore and I've stopped pretending like it helps me be more productive. I actually get shit done if I'm sober, ironically. I can't do anything even in the weekend before my entire house is tip top clean. I can't say it has been easy or that it went fast, but I did nonetheless.

Now that I've got it to purely recreational the next step for 2020 is gonna be to reduce it even further to max 1 or 2 times a month, certainly not every weekend anymore. A stretch goal would be to literally only do it if I'm actually going out to a party and staying up late. I don't think I can say goodbye forever (yet), but if I can keep my use purely non-problematic like this, I feel like that's a victory.",22,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9386646747589111}"
