    This survey has been approved by the moderators.     

Hi everyone,

I am Melvin Goh, a PhD student from the University of Wollongong, Australia. My PhD research focuses on improving the health and well-being of people impacted by alcohol and other drugs via health risk communication.

I am conducting a study to survey people living in Australia and the United States of America (USA) about their alcohol and other drug use, health and well-being, health behaviours, and the impact of COVID-19 (UOW Ethics Approval No. 2019/183).

**What’s involved?**

You are invited to complete an anonymous online survey about your use of a range of substances, health and well-being, health behaviours, and COVID-19. The survey may take up to 20 minutes, although some people may complete it faster. Please be assured that your responses will be kept strictly ANONYMOUS as the survey does not ask of any personal identifiable details from you!

**To be eligible to participate, you will need to:**

* Be aged 18 and above living in Australia or the USA;
* Have had problems with illicit drugs or alcohol and/or have attended alcohol or other drugs (AOD) treatment in the past 12 months.

Please visit [https://uow.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_dm1oXM1GmqDEJQV](https://uow.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_dm1oXM1GmqDEJQV) to participate or to get more information on the survey.

Eligible participants who complete the entire survey can enter a prize draw to win one of five $50 Amazon gift cards (currency based on location). I understand that a lucky draw for a gift card isn't the most attractive incentive, but I hope you can understand that it is the most I can get as a student. More importantly, it will help me with the PhD and achieve my aim of improving the health and well-being of people impacted by alcohol and/or other drugs.

If you have any questions, please let me know. Thank you to everyone who took the time to read my post and complete my survey :)",3,2
2,2021-02-27 12:58:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/lttjlm/here_i_am_again/,Here I am again.,"Let me start by saying that once, a long time ago I had over 10 years clean. I have some mental issues but I was much happier than I had ever been high. 
  Fast forward until 5 years ago. I was with the love of my life and we had a good life together. We rarely drank and never even thought about drugs. It was all about family and I saw my children and grandchildren daily. I saw myself growing old with him. 
  Well I went on a trip to see an old friend and while I was out of state he called me and out of the blue, announced that he was going back to his ex wife. I was stunned and completely blindsided.
  When I returned home 2 days later he had already moved his things out. I had been a stay at home wife for those 6 years and had no way to support myself at all. 
  Fast forward, my BFF got me a (crappie) job and I re-learned how to take care of myself again. We went out and had a few drinks a couple nights a week and I was healing. 
  Then I met Satan. He was a handsome, charming man and showed me so much attention, I fell for him like a ton of bricks. I really believed that he only wanted me and after my last man, it made me feel special. 
  A year into it he brought drugs out in front of me and asked me to do it but I said no. Until he broke out that fucking pipe. I remember telling him to please don't offer that to me because if I touch it I will be lost again. 
  And I was. He turned out to be a textbook narcissist who put me through hell for 4 years. He abused me in every way and only stuck around if I was providing him dope. 
  But oh, I loved him and if I only did (insert some crazy thing) for him, he would open up and see what I was worth and would love me like I loved him. He didn't. Ever. 
  Fast forward again to 3 weeks ago. I was trying to quit for the millionth time because I was in so much pain and was sobbing every day because I didn't want to be high anymore. 5 days in to it I ran out of dope to give him and he sat right in front of me and smoked it. While I was trying to get clean. 
  I just snapped. Told him to get the fuck out and if he ever came near me again I'd put his ass in jail. It was the only thing I could tell him to be sure he'd stay away. I didn't cry, or beg or waver. I'd had enough. 
  I haven't had a second thought about it. I was ready. He was my biggest trigger. The entire time I've been with him I haven't managed more than 2 months clean. 
  The pain I was in was due to a kidney infection. I've been on 3 antibiotics now and it's not clearing up. I know it's from using because I hardly eat or drink at all. 
  A month ago I got the best job of my life at a local hospital. I don't know how I passed the UA but somehow I did, however I got scared, thinking I would fail at the job and ran back to the dope. 
  I've been there a month now and I've been high every day but I have to stop. I remember what a real life is like and that's what I want. 
  Every time I pick up the pipe I sob for hours. I fucking hate how I feel when I'm high. My family gave up on me and won't talk to me. If I want to salvage anything good in my life I have to stop now. 
  I'm very poor and I can't take even 1 day off work. Sometimes when I quit, I feel fine. The last time was awful. I couldn't think and I didn't think I'd ever feel good again. But I did. 
  I know what to do. I just need help making it stick so you'll be seeing me here often. Please pray for me or send good wishes. I deserve a better life. I just have to be strong enough to get out and KEEP it. 
  My triggers and boredom and loneliness and they're going to be here in abundance. My job is physically demanding so if I work hard I'll sleep and I sleep like 10 hours a day. I'm off this weekend but I have some people lined up to keep me company. 
  But in a couple weeks they'll wander off like always and I'll be alone again. I'm so afraid...",5,1

while i didn't use it for a prolonged amount of time i stimfapped maybe 4 times. And used once in a social setting. All spaced out with atleast two weeks or up to several months (6 months). So in total i took this substance maybe 5 or 6 times...

After my last ""binge"" during my first semester of university i managed to stay away from it, up until now...

I am not sure what triggered these intense cravings and me sourcing it, but here i am. I am currently coming down from the binge last night, where i approx. consumed 120mg. It wasn't even that enjoyable but i guess that will be forgotten. Ofc i flushed the rest of the stash.

Anyhow the reason i came here is because i am asking for advice what to do and to hear your stories!

I’ve lost count how many times I’ve tried to quit this shit for the better part of a decade. Last time my wife said the next one is divorce or rehab. I’m so fucking terrified of rehab and the thought that it’s probably a waste of time and money. How is a month clean and therapy going to help a degenerate like me?

Since then i only make it a month, maybe two before I do it again. 

I’m just sitting here fantasizing about making a run for it to score some dope. It’s all I can think about the last two days. I don’t want to go to rehab, I deserve to be divorced and alone. My wife won’t let me go. She still wants me around for some reason even though all I do is ruin our lives. I lost the best damn job I’ll ever have  a few months ago. After 15 years there!

Now I work two part time jobs and make half as much money. And my wife wants to throw away 10-30 grand to try to help me best this. Doesn’t she know a lost cause when she sees one?

Went through the whole rollercoaster from being in a constant euphoric state, working an insane amount of hours, making tons of money, looking like a super Dad when really I was a dick to my kids and my wife, to taking 3x my dose, not getting shit done, alienating myself, being a hypocrite to all, y'all know the deal. The only part I miss really is the hours long sex marathons and being slender. 

I quit taking adderall about 2 months ago, the first month wasn't that bad, couldn't stay up past 8 at night and couldn't last more than 10 minutes in bed but I figured that would go away in time. 

Month two was much more lethargic and just an overall feeling of exhaustion, and some substantial weight gain. Has anyone turned to exercise or possibly testosterone replacement therapy after quitting? I feel like I know in my heart that if I were to start working out again, aside from the hopeful weight loss, I would get some energy out of it? Before adderall I would workout daily, sometimes twice a day and the energy I would maintain throughout the day was amazing. I'm 6'7"" and currently 270lbs and terrified I'm going to end up the size of a house. During the first couple years of my adderall downfall I got down to about 220lbs and I loved it. I'm worried if I end up super fat the depression and negative self imagine I'll have of myself will fuck me up more than the adderall did.

I was prescribed 10mg Adderall IR 2x daily between December 2019 and September 2020, which is when I quit. Between March and late August I would get ""kinda high"" maybe twice or more a week, and at my worst I would get ""really high"" i.e. binge for two days maybe once every other week.

It's also worth mentioning that I went on to start a wellbutrin prescription about 2.5 weeks after quitting adderall cold turkey. It's worked well for me.

My problem is that my energy, mood, and ability to focus haven't rebounded as quickly as I hoped they would. They've gotten progressively better but it's slow going. 

There's also a depressing worldwide pandemic going on, and staying at home all the time is enough to make anyone anxious and foggy-headed. So I'm trying to take that into consideration as well.

But...

I'm wondering if there's any rule of thumb regarding recovery time, as in, abuse for X number of months requires Y months of abstinence to get back to normal. Or if anyone can relate their experiences with quitting and the length of their recovery.

I've only read experiences from people who misused the drug for several years, not for nine months or so. And so I'm very curious if anyone has advice or suggestions for my particular situation.

Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance for your replies!",18,1

Feel fine, except for my serotonin and dopamine capacities.","It’s been a long month, honestly. I always read throughly about any of the drugs I put it my system, but for the first few weeks I didn’t have any side effects, so I didn’t mind using any supplements.

Of course, I fried my brain. Not heavily, but to the point where none of the drugs work no more, no matter the dose. Pretty sure if I was to try heroin, I wouldn’t even feel it. And, trust me, I really stopped getting any highs.

So I’ve decided to call it quits, or at least take a break. I started to think about it as soon as I had my first side-effects, but now getting high itself is basically just side-effects. 

Due to excessive gaming on par with stim abuse, I started to get excruciating pain in my hands. Overtime, the pain worsened by spreading to random muscles around my entire body — my legs, arms, neck, back, crotch, etc. I started taking a lot of magnesium, but it didn’t help. As soon as I switched to chelated magnesium, the pain is gone. Supplements started to work. Vitamin C helped me flush amphetamines out of my system; proper hydration helped my heart and blood; etc.

But there’s an issue I must still address, aside from addiction. It’s my serotonin and dopamine receptors, their capacities.

Here’s supplements I came up with:
• 5-HTP + Green Tea Extract — to help bring back all the lost serotonin hormones.
• L-Theanin — for dopamine. 

Yes, I know supplements are not a magic pill. No need to tell me, I’m working on it. All I need is to pick the right medications to bring my life back. Keep in my that money I can spend on all of this is quite short, so I’d appreciate recommendations numbered by their significance. 

Lastly, don’t tell me to visit a doctor. If I could, I would.

Thank you.

TL;DR: Need supplements to help bring back serotonin and dopamine hormones.",8,0

I use(d) it as a performance enhancer at work, feeling like I could be as fast as a computer, sharp as fuck, a work ninja. But I took too much too often. Ohhhh I fucked up.

Good news is I still have my job (hanging by a thread), and I’m kicking my addiction. My productivity is wayyyy down, I forget important shit all the time, I’m indecisive and slow. It turns out I’m not actually an organized, detail oriented person. I’m not actually overflowing with knowledge or facts or even the right words for the right lunch utensils! Growing up I was afraid to be normal (like my parents)—but actually, I am mediocre, just kind of average, old, and a little dumb. I have to be okay with the fact of my mediocrity, because the alternative doesn’t really exist anymore. I used it all up. 

I have been self-reflecting on how quitting feels like a loss, the death of a best friend (who  stabbed you in the back.) But I still miss it, and I’m trying to hold my sadness and witness it.",3,0

My friend we will call S. I met S when I started at college- I sat next to him in a class. He is a strong, buff dude, but soft spoken and kind. As I got to know him, I found out he was in prison for several years on drug related charges. He had been clean for 18 months. He had previously been addicted to meth and heroin, but meth was his drug of choice. He had truly turned his life around. He is a physical trainer, has/had good grades, has his own apartment, has a job working at our college, etc. We went to the gym together occasionally and had been to my house numerous times, over for dinner with my partner and I- came to thanksgiving, has helped us move apartment, etc etc. For as long as I’ve known him, he’s been doing amazing. 

A few months ago he met a girl. He seemed to have a healthy, happy relationship, but it wasn’t called that, he just called it a friends with benefits with someone he really cared about. They both felt the same way as far as I know. 

I moved away in December to another state- we have still been in contact, talking every other day to sometimes once a week, but still remaining close. 

A few weeks ago he started acting a little differently - I asked him if he was struggling. He let me know he was “close to crisis, but won’t get to the point of relapse because he doesn’t want to lose all the good things he has.” I believed him. A few days later he messaged me, as usual, and seemed erratic. I asked him if he was okay. He responded at 4 in the morning, saying “The me that you know is not me right now.” I have spoken to him. He has relapsed. 

I spoke to his sponsor who told me that S will recover, just give him time, he may do an intervention, S is “harmless” And said this has happened before, S will stop using after about a week or two. I asked how I can support him best. He said don’t give him money, and just talk to him, check up on him, I said of course. 

For the last few days, he has been erratic in our chats, obviously on meth, even used in front of me on camera which I expressed I was NOT okay with. But that I am here for him, and I am here to support him. He has cried many times telling me he is so angry at himself for throwing it all away- and will sob for a second, and go back to the manic behavior. He is almost always driving when I speak to him - apparently driving in circles. 
He told me that he hadn’t slept for 5 days and went to the girls house, and lied to her, saying he wasn’t using, but eventually confessed. She said that she doesn’t want to talk to him until he is clean, at least for a few months. It shattered him from what he told me. 

I asked if he wants to stop during one of our conversations while he was driving. He said “I will stop, I know I will, but I need something to stop me. I need something bad enough to happen to inspire me to stop or else it’s just too easy and too fun to keep going. But I will stop. It just won’t be tonight.” 

As far as I know, it’s been about 10 days of him using. Yesterday, however, he video chatted me and had shaved his face, gotten a hair cut, and looked much more like himself than he recently had. He let me know he feels as if he will stop. He is checking out of the hotel and going home. 

My partner also cares a lot about S. I told him what’s happening. My partner said S can come stay with us if it will help get him away from the bad/triggering environment. We can pay for his ticket. I agreed. Especially because we live in sunny California, we have a backyard, a home gym, grill, big-ish home, and have sweet animals, no kids, no roommates - it’s a nice place if I say so myself. We laid down some rules, such as we want him to attend meetings even if online, we want him to work on school, he is welcome to use the gym, but he is not allowed to leave without letting us know where he’s going. He’s welcome to cook (which he enjoys) etc. 

I spoke to S’s sponsor- who said it’s a bad idea. But hasn’t explained much of why. 

I told S that I want him here, but I want to make sure it’s a good idea. I expressed hesitancy of S smoking marijuana while he’s here (my partner and I smoke about once a week but know that when S was clean, he wasn’t smoking, so we feel unsure about it.) S says it’s harmless, not the “drug that matters”, etc, but agreed to the other rules. I said I would prefer if he can be sober when he gets here- he said that’s not possible probably but he will try to sober up quickly once he gets here (he won’t have his drugs anyway, so I said ok). I let him know that I spoke to his sponsor and that I will have to tell him that he is coming. S seemed irritated and said “he (sponsor) is always tangled up in my shit”.  But agreed with our rules, promised to be respectful (S has never been disrespectful by the way). 

I am just hoping someone can tell me whether or not this is ok, and if we are okay to move forward with purchasing S’s ticket (I said I will not give him cash, I will buy directly on a website, which S understood.) Because I have no addiction history, nor does my partner, and S’s sponsor isn’t giving me much info, I just want someone who understands addiction to tell me if this is okay or not. I hope this makes sense. 

Thank you in advance. Sorry that this is so long.",8,0

    This survey has been approved by the moderators.    

Hi everyone,

I am Melvin Goh, a PhD student from the University of Wollongong, Australia. My PhD research focuses on improving the health and well-being of people impacted by alcohol and other drugs via health risk communication.

I am conducting a study to survey people living in Australia and the United States of America (USA) about their alcohol and other drug use, health and well-being, health behaviours, and the impact of COVID-19 (UOW Ethics Approval No. 2019/183).

**What’s involved?**

You are invited to complete an anonymous online survey about your use of a range of substances, health and well-being, health behaviours, and COVID-19. The survey may take up to 20 minutes, although some people may complete it faster. Please be assured that your responses will be kept strictly ANONYMOUS as the survey does not ask of any personal identifiable details from you!

**To be eligible to participate, you will need to:**

* Be aged 18 and above living in Australia or the USA;
* Have had problems with illicit drugs or alcohol and/or have attended alcohol or other drugs (AOD) treatment in the past 12 months.

Please visit [https://uow.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_dm1oXM1GmqDEJQV](https://uow.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_dm1oXM1GmqDEJQV) to participate or to get more information on the survey.

Eligible participants who complete the entire survey can enter a prize draw to win one of five $50 Amazon gift cards (currency based on location). I understand that a lucky draw for a gift card isn't the most attractive incentive, but I hope you can understand that it is the most I can get as a student. More importantly, it will help me with the PhD and achieve my aim of improving the health and well-being of people impacted by alcohol and/or other drugs.

If you have any questions, please let me know. Thank you to everyone who took the time to read my post and complete my survey :)",1,2

Well, I relapsed last year around July 2020. Two days ago I told myself, fuck this shit I’m tired of being a slave to the drug. I also want to quit because sometimes I get a bag of fake dope or dope that just smells sooo gross and I’m like ok, I’m done. 

WELL, yesterday I was in and out of sleep, and then I randomly have a BRAIN ZAP. And I’m like ok.... that was a bit intense. Well today.. I had COnstant!!!! BRAIN ZAPS!!! Like back to back!!! I was in agony. I drove to my plugs house, fighting these brain zaps. As soon as I arrive, I load up a fat ass syringe and as soon as it hit, I could feel the brain zaps slowly disappear.  

At this point I’m not doing it because like the high, i’m doing it because withdrawals are a BITCH when u don’t have a full week of sleeping. I can’t function like that. I need to lock myself away for a couple weeks when I don’t have any responsibilities!!!!",19,0

Currently on my longest streak at 4 months.  I was a user for 7 years part time.  The first 4-5 years was just snorting it to keep me up so I could work all weekend long doing 2 jobs.  Then I got into smoking it and fucking... and that was it.  

Towards the end I was like I'll just get a bag and stay up all night working, and the second I got it I was just hitting it non-stop searching online for people to hook up with.  I never got to the using daily stage but whenever I got some i'd use till it was all gone and I was a mess.

Each time I give up I find it easy for the first month or so, and then the cravings build and build.  I dream about it more and more and it occupies my conscious and sub-conscious till I eventually cave.  I'm pretty close to caving right about now.  I don't crave the meth so much as the meth-sex.  And I don't crave sober sex at all, which is probably why the cravings build up over time. Just meth sex, crave meth sex.

I know I wish I could go back to the old days of getting high, but am aware that's never gonna happen.  

Anyone else been through similar story, where instead of it getting better over time, sobriety gets harder over time???  Driving me crazy, would appreciate anyone with any experience on this. Thanks.",36,0

This is just my personal experience after two years of daily use, followed by 8 months in recovery, followed by two MONTHS daily use. Months, not years.

It gets worse. It definitely gets worse, at least for me. At two months of daily use I am where I was after two years of daily use before. My tolerance came back almost immediately and the joy was sucked out of the drug faster than I could shoot, snort, hotrail, or eat my way through it. And yet my brain kept/keeps telling me... *more... this time you'll get that feeling back... just a little more... and then....* **Fuck what did I do oh fuck I'm going to die.** And I'm so burnt out that it probably won't be that hard to put it down this time... for a day or so.

I've always been careful on how much I use and how often, with certain boundaries I don't cross, such as IV administration, or having a direct link to a dealer. However, looking back from the past 3 months, I've realised I've done this damn drug every week for 12 weeks. I can barely get to 7 days before looking for more, and now I've noticed that I have a mild tolerance to it. I used to think that people don't just slip into addiction, but having had alcohol and weed do exactly that, now I've done the same thing with meth. And I'm over it. I want my sleep back, I want to stop being angry 50% of the time, and its a waste of money for the quality these days. So I'm committed to trying to break the 2 weeks mark this time around and go from there.

I want to quit, I told myself 20 days ago but I've relapsed 3 times counting today. I'm(f24) living with my parents and two of my brothers(4 and 23), dad is on a bussiness trip and my mom is the kind of person you don't want to wake up even if you are dying.

I threw away my pipes and lighters but kept one piece of crystal, so I decided to try booty pump for the first time and ended up using way too much (didn't know about dosage). Fuck, I tought I was going to die. Couldn't breathe and the next moment I'm hyperventilating, I was nauseous but I knew (or I got the feeling at least) that if I puked, I was going to choke and die, I couldn't even drink water or swallow saliva without burping and feeling like everything turned black for a few seconds. My fingers and arms felt numb and tingle. Couldn't controll my body, my legs were shaking like a newborn deer, it looked blue under my nails (don't know if this was just paranoia). My heart was racing fast, REALLY FUCKING BERSERK FAST, I saw on my watch that my heartbeat was up to 156hpm. Tried to calm the fck down, closed my eyes and felt worst, I tried speaking to myself outloud but even for speaking 1 word I felt like I didn't have enough air, I wanted to pray or something but I was starting to feel desperate. I couldn't focus on my phone, I wanted to ask someone for help or something but I dind't had the chance cause all went blurry and then too bright.

I passed out on my bathroom floor. Woke still scared as fuck and threw the remaining meth (I was shaking, my jaw hurted a lot, my heartbead wasn't slowing down, still couldn't breath but at least I got to text a friend). With one eye closed, I told him what was going on and he told me that if I didn't tell anyone in the next 2 minutes, he was going to call my mother and my brother in that exact moment cause I was having an overdose (this friend is the only person who knows about my drug abuse), I asked him not to and then I called my father (still shaking, feeling like I was going to die), told him I felt sick (didn't tell him exactly what was going on), he told me that if I was still feeling the same on the next 30 minutes, he'll wake up my mother to take me to the hospital.

This went on for an hour and a half, it was awful and I've never felt like this before nor I want to feel it again. I've always said that I wanted to die, have a few suicide attempts but shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit, all I could think was ""MY LITTLE BROTHER IS 4 YEARS OLD. HE IS GOING TO SEE MY CORPSE"".

I'm going to tell my dad the truth when he gets home on Saturday. I tought I could quit this alone but I can't.

&#x200B;

\*Now I'm starting to feel better. Tomorrow (or when I wake up...) I'm going to my 1st psychiatric appointment and to the doctor, to do damage control.  Also, if anyone has any advice on how to tell my father about this will be thanked (maybe not telling him the exact moment I started using and that this was an overdose). I started 3 months ago and no one I know uses drugs (except this friend, he smokes weed and that's how I got confident on telling him about my decision to quit).

Any help/advice welcome,"I first discovered Adderall on spring break my sophomore year of high school, when one of our friends shared a few of their (prescribed, I think) pills with us because we were having fun being young and wanted to stay up all night. “Harmless”, relatively speaking. When I took it and realized that with this tiny pill I could live in a world where “I don’t have to sleep”, my life changed. 

I turn 30 in August so at this point Adderall has been my friend, supporter and confidant for half of my life. I love that stupid pill — it masks my insecurities and makes me capable of doing more than most people. I can juggle an insane workload, a social life, and even sometimes get creative projects done (though the pill minimizes my creativity most of the time), and I stay talkative and skinny along the way. 

I didn’t feel pretty in high school so once I met Adderall I decided I would accomplish a lot to make me feel better about myself. Being praised for how much I do became a core part of my ego. In high school I was editor of the yearbook and newspaper, president of multiple clubs, varsity athlete all 4 years, took an intense course load and excelled at art. I had tons of friends, (some of who would take Adderall from their little brothers and give it to me) and if I had to guess, most of my peers thought I was happy and that I was lucky that things came “easy” to me. I became known for “burning the candle at both ends,” but since I was achieving things I don’t recall there being any pressure to stop burning the candle. My parents tried sometimes but that probably made me want to burn the candle more. In retrospect, I did things in high school that normal people don’t do. The school system almost let me take Chemistry during my lunch period because I was already enrolled in too many classes. I pulled all nighters or did things like go to school at 5:30AM to edit the yearbook, clutching a massive Diet Coke. 

I’ve always had a lot of passions so I guess people wrote it off as that. 

I took Adderall to take the SAT, which was the same day as prom so I think I had to take another Adderall that night to stay awake (also lost my virginity that night, “lol”). I got used to living at a higher level of intensity than my peers.

When I got to university it was easier than ever to get the pill. I love art but didn’t go to a school with a strong art program so I often procrastinated on schoolwork for classes I didn’t want to take, and then would go to the library for all-nighters — sometimes up to 3 all nighters at a time — to cram my work. I always did well in school, and this system let me prioritize everything BUT the schoolwork, so tbh it was working well for me. I remember one time being in the library and it looked like the bookshelves were breathing because I was so tired things were starting to move. 

But here’s the thing — by this point my self-worth was tied to achieving things. I had a strong drive to get away from home (North Carolina), so I set my sights on California. I wanted to achieve the hardest thing possible as a final proof point that I was capable. This would make my parents happy and make me proud and I’d feel good about myself, right?

Most semesters I had 2-3 internships/jobs on top of a full course load and VERY FULL social life. Adderall enabled me to juggle it all. The tech industry moved at a similar pace and I became enamored by the idea of working at one of these very competitive, elusive, shiny companies. 

I don’t remember how much Adderall I took to prepare for my Google interviews, but I have never studied harder for anything. Since I actually wanted the job there’s a chance I took less than normal, but who knows. 

I got my internship at Google at age 20, and worked extremely hard that entire summer (in my head it was a 13-week-long interview). I even convinced HR to let me lengthen my internship by a week because I’d taken on so much work and my team didn’t want me to leave. I ALWAYS had so much on my plate, but this became my normal. This was the only way I knew how to live. 

Less than a month after my internship ended I received a full time job offer from Google. I spent my senior year having FUN, gained a bunch of weight because I wasn’t taking as much Adderall and was drinking a lot and eating unhealthy. I hadn’t learned how to take care of myself very well — sleep wasn’t valued, treating my body well wasn’t valued. I was introduced to other drugs my senior year and learned I had an affinity for uppers, but Adderall remained my drug of choice as it wasn’t a drug, it was medicine, right? The irony of this is that my mom is a pharmaceutical researcher, which made me feel extra bad about the amount of Adderall I took sans prescription. 

I moved to San Francisco to begin working at Google full time. I FINALLY got my own Adderall prescription (it was easy as pie, I knew exactly what to tell the doctor). TBH I think I do have ADD to some extent, but I’ve always fed the doctors a story, which is different than getting tested without an end goal in mind. I was on Vyvanse at first which I really liked, but switched to short release Adderall eventually because it was easier to dose myself throughout the day and keep a tiny chance of getting some sleep. Safe to say I worked 70-80 hours some weeks and never slept much. I could operate “normal” on less than 5 hours of sleep. 

I was so stressed, and that manifested physically. At one point I had an inhaler which I used for when I had to run to the busstop to catch my 7:05AM bus to Silicon Valley. I’d get on the bus and drink a black iced coffee and then usually have a cup of pineapple for breakfast. In retrospect, what a spookily acidic combo to pair with a high dose of Adderall. 

This is now an essay but I am hoping someone might take time to read it and perhaps have some advice. I know there must be a lot of people in my position, who have abused Adderall to achieve things, work harder, work longer, juggle more. I think I am equally addicted to the pill as I am to the high I get from knowing I’m about to crush the day. I am addicted to Adderall AND, as a byproduct, productivity.

Adderall drains my creativity and makes me focus on things I typically don’t like doing. I became an insane budget-master, able to balance multi million dollar corporate budgets. I was the project leader where people “always worked harder when working with me”. I was applauded for how much I as able to juggle. Again and again. 

At my core I am a creative, empathetic, sensitive person. Adderall drained those emotions from me, making me instead become a workhorse who was only focused on getting it done at all costs. Eventually I went into a pretty deep depression and took 90 days off of work. I found that it was socially acceptable to blame it on “burn out”, which felt weak but also had a hint of pride. I worked so hard that I burnt out. Is that an achievement now? 

My doctors said that I went through the burnout cycle twice (there are different stages and symptoms along the way, none of which I picked up on because I was so numb thanks to Adderall), so by the time I finished the second simultaneous burn out I crashed really really hard. This depression was simple: I’d been living for too long doing things I didn’t actually enjoy, ignoring my creative spirit, and putting unrealistic pressure on myself to achieve. To be perfect. To only bring good news to my parents. To collect stickers and hang them on my report card, even if it meant I was a zombie as a result. 

The hardest part during this time was that most of my friends from college were working entry level jobs and socializing as much as they were working. They did things like go to happy hour while I worked 7AM-10PM and then had a private car that would drive me home for free. Sometimes I stayed in hotels near my office (all of this was financially covered by the company. Not encouraged necessarily, but paid for without question). When I stayed in hotels near work I would wear the same thing to work two days in a row, or sometimes I kept additional clothes at my desk. 

Adderall made all of this happen. I was a driven kid, yes, but my past 15 years have been INSANE thanks to that little pill. I don’t necessarily regret it, but I am finally able to face the massive impact it had on my life. There were lots of pros: I was one of the top performers at the hardest company to get a job at, I got to travel the world without getting jet lag, etc — but deep down I knew this was all just a bandaid. But I was stuck on a roller coaster that I couldn’t get off. 

Eventually I moved to New York, left Google and started my own company. Spoiler alert: I did not work less now that I was working for myself. If anything, I worked harder because I was so excited / relieved / inspired to be doing non-Google work. I love to work when it’s something I’m genuinely interested in (spoiler alert: not budgets). 

ALRIGHT SO that brings us (more or less) to today. In March 2020 I realized how much I rely on this drug, and that I don’t think I like the person it makes me. I like the “normal” version of myself, I think, at least. I wanted to go off of Adderall but it is so much harder than it sounds. 

My boyfriend started to hide the pills from me and that worked for awhile but TBH I loved to go on scavenger hunts looking for them and trying to imagine where he’d hide them next. Once COVID got intense I threw in the towel and took Adderall while building a new studio and trying to keep myself distracted and busy. Somewhere along the way I did 11 rounds of interviews for another big tech job, and the entire time I had a voice in the back of my head beggging me not to take another job where I dose myself according to my meeting schedule. 

I turn 30 in late August so if I make a plan by late February I will have 6 months to get off Adderall. I have read SO MUCH on the internet, and am really grateful for everyone who posts in here and gives their honest stories and advice. I am really scared. As you can tell, I’ve always been rewarded for being able to do things when I set my mind to them. I am afraid that this is the first thing I’ve ever tried to do that I can’t succeed at alone. Not to mention, when I don’t take Adderall I feel an entirely different range of emotions. When I don’t take Adderall I feel the sadness of the state of America, the loneliness from the pandemic, the insecurity about my future, the fear of not finding a lifelong partner. When I don’t take it I miss those ups that it gives me. Not only does it give me the energy to do things, but it gives me the confidence and assertiveness to somehow avoid my biggest fears — to keep them tucked away. When I don’t take it I feel bad about myself because I’m not producing as much, not achieving as much (or so I think), and am feeling more. More sadness, more tiredness, etc. 

I apologize for writing so much. If anyone has been through this it would be so helpful to hear from you, and to hear any tips of how you got through the massive shift in thinking — learning how to recalibrate the amount a normal person should do in a day, should sleep, how much they can juggle at once, etc. I want to have kids one day and I don’t want to be the mom who is taking Adderall and frantically cleaning the house - I can totally imagine Adderall helping a LOT when raising young kids. I want to be clean by the time I’m 30. 

If anyone has tips on communities I can join, support groups, etc - I’m all ears. I took Adderall today, so am literally on day 0 of being clean. I have probably taken it 5 out of 7 days recently, so I am making a tiny bit of progress in taking it less often, and also taking a lower dose. I am considering downloading one of those addiction apps that tracks your progress, and have thought about going to AA, and am open to anything that has helped people in the past. I am afraid of trying to do this by myself during COVID as I spend most days by myself (and nights), aka it gets lonely quickly and easily. I also don’t want to replace Adderall with other drugs. The one exception is Wellbutrin, which I’m currently prescribed 300MG a day - partially for my depression and partially because I have been wanting to go off Adderall for awhile now and heard this can help (which my doctor agreed with). 

I’m really really grateful to have found this community and sincerely thank anyone who takes time to read this and offer advice/input/support. I hope to one day be one of the people who is writing in this group about how I’ve been clean for awhile, and offering encouragement to others who hope to do the same. 

Fingers crossed - tomorrow is a new day and I’m feeling more committed than ever.",73,4

anyway, it’s gotta stop. i’m ruining my brain. my brain’s gone bad. i can feel it like, rotting up there.

before this whole mess began, wellbutrin worked really well for me. disgustingly well. i want to start taking it again but i’m worried it won’t do anything at this point.

i know the obvious solution is like, just take it & find out. you silly bitch. but i’m scared that it won’t work like before. i mean, 7 days/month i’m dunking myself in like, criminal amounts of dopamine. i don’t know if wellbutrin can compete.

but so basically, if it doesn’t work i’ll be left with the stupid hollow dreadful sensation that i’ve ruined my whole life, that everything is hopeless, that i’ll never be happy again, etc. etc.

I'm 22yo and have been clean for 3 years. I moved from California back to my hometown chicago to get away from the drug because i knew if i was in the same state as it id keep doing it. This worked well, I haven't relapsed and things have been ok. One thing I noticed it how absolutely destroyed my brain is. It's like im unable to feel the normal pleasures of life after boosting my dopamine and feel good receptors so high. I was only addicted for a year on and off but it got extremely bad for a few months where i was on a constant binge, 3-4days on, crash, repeat. One or two of those days i'd be masturbating for 12+ hours consuming ungodly amounts through my nose or via the pipe. Despite all of this i'm still relatively normal i feel, but this depression is definetly weighing on me. After about a month back from cali i went straight to work and found a job at panera they hired me on the spot. I worked there for a month then on one of my days of i passed by a lexus dealership and figured ""hell theres alot more money to made at a place like this than panera"" so i walked in, in my bball shorts n J's and they hired me on the spot! A week later he calls me and said he's gonna put me into a position higher than where he originally hired me because he liked me.  Fast foward about a month i'm on a smoke break and the GM of the store comes out to smoke, im a little nervous and flustured but i start a conversation with him about sales. He asks me how old i am and i say 19 he says come back when your 21 we'll talk. A week later there were budget cuts and i was let go but they told me to go to their other store down the street for a sales position. I walk on down there and the gm is waiting for me, i get hired instantly and am educated on how selling a car is like banging a hot chick. I was instantly intrigued and excited. I worked this job for about 4 months slowly making progress and bettering myself (Before i left california i was a meth addicted idiot driving around local gangs for drugs n money now I found something that was truly meaningful and impactful on my life) and a finance manager told me all about adderall and that given my situation it would probably help me focus on whats important. So I did it, I went to his doctor and the doctor happily filled an adderall script. I told it for about 4 or 5 months and in the beginning it was amazing! I felt like myself and felt much more solid mentally. I was able to improve my work and become much more professional along with making more money. After on the script i moved out from my moms within 2 months and got my own apartment, it was amazing after everything id gone through i felt like things were finally taking a turn. But I could never get that lucky, psychosis started to hit me like i was on meth again! thinking things that werent real, crazy anxiety, distorted social ques. Basically a full on breakdown. To be fair i doubled my dosage around the time i moved out on my own and was drinking energy drinks/coffee when taking the adderall at that time. So long story short (wanted to give a little background and maybe a little motivation from my story) has anyone who has quit use of meth experimented with adderall? The government document on their studies of meth shows that amphetamines did help recovering patients in their studies, it just didn't say anything about how their newfound use of adderall impacts their mental health after taking something like methamphetamine.",13,0

    This survey has been approved by the moderators.  

Hi everyone,

I am Melvin Goh, a PhD student from the University of Wollongong, Australia. My PhD research focuses on improving the health and well-being of people impacted by alcohol and other drugs via health risk communication.

I am conducting a study to survey people living in Australia and the United States of America (USA) about their alcohol and other drug use, health and well-being, health behaviours, and the impact of COVID-19 (UOW Ethics Approval No. 2019/183).

**What’s involved?**

You are invited to complete an anonymous online survey about your use of a range of substances, health and well-being, health behaviours, and COVID-19. The survey may take up to 20 minutes, although some people may complete it faster. Please be assured that your responses will be kept strictly ANONYMOUS as the survey does not ask of any personal identifiable details from you!

**To be eligible to participate, you will need to:**

* Be aged 18 and above living in Australia or the USA;
* Have had problems with illicit drugs or alcohol and/or have attended alcohol or other drugs (AOD) treatment in the past 12 months.

Please visit [https://uow.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_dm1oXM1GmqDEJQV](https://uow.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_dm1oXM1GmqDEJQV) to participate or to get more information on the survey.

Eligible participants who complete the entire survey can enter a prize draw to win one of five $50 Amazon gift cards (currency based on location). I understand that a lucky draw for a gift card isn't the most attractive incentive, but I hope you can understand that it is the most I can get as a student. More importantly, it will help me with the PhD and achieve my aim of improving the health and well-being of people impacted by alcohol and/or other drugs.

My addiction began in the end of my high school years and has been consistent ever since with a some pauses along the way. I'm from Bulgaria where amphetamines are quite popular and very cheap. My first few years were lets say ""fun"" while using, but eventually I felt like the hype of the drug just started to go down, this of course did not stop me from using since I felt like I'm just taking the crappy stuff. In my past year, I have tried to stop using 2 times both lasted for 1-2 months before I relapsed and started using again.   


I turn to all of you, as I need advice regarding this and I really wonder how all of you decided to stop using. Me personally, after I take amphetamines and don't sleep for a day or two, I get into this moment where I just reflect on my past and try to see a reason for me still getting high on this shit. I feel like I don't really have a reason except the fact that I love gaming for 12 hours straight, or from time to time working and be extra productive in my office. On the other hand I know that this destroys me and eventually it could result in a fatal end.   


So far, I have never given my self a good reason to stop but deep down I know its best for me to do so. I guess its just tough to get rid of something which has been a part of you for so long, but I really want  to do it once and for all.   


I don't feel like myself, and I already feel some side effects due to the use. I know that this can be healed, but for that to happen I need to stop.   


I saw a lot of you guys posting your stories, and I'm really happy to hear that people get through this shit and start to enjoy their life as everyone should, I'm sure ready to be amphetamines free as well.
