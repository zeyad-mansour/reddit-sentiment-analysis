I was abusing it to the point of getting psychosis so I was cut off from the medication 11 months ago. I tried Wellbutrin XL for a bit but I don't think it was helping. My psychiatrist doesn't feel comfortable putting me on any other medication, so I'm just tired and unmotivated all the time.

I recently learned that I may be getting laid off from work in the coming months. The bigger problem is I haven't worked out in over a year (I am very out of shape), have no interest in anything (sleep most of the day), and am in no shape to start interviewing for other jobs. I'm a 33M working in HR. I have no hobbies and spend most of my weekends alone - I will likely come off like a loser in these interviews. I feel like I'm in a very deep hole I've dug for myself.

I'm trying to take things step by step and maybe getting back into working out, hoping that will gradually lead into being more productive and getting back into other productive habits.

Does anyone have any advice on what helped you get a boost after quitting?",4

Don't think it won't happen to you.. becoming a meth addict. Stop while you can.,"My dumbass was clean for 3.5 years.. I couldn't get addicted to it in the past. Even shot it up once and nothing. I just quit after that and looked at meth as a one time thing tbh (and haven't touched a needle in over 4 years.. but man do I remember how scared I was when I did it. My heart rate was crazy fast and I was puking so much instantly and so scary high. Scared me clean).

Thinking I was ""above it"" I used again January 2019 by doing a line at a club for the hell of it. It was offered and I was like kay sure. I still felt like meh whatever this is cool I guess but I still didn't crave it. Felt ""the need"" to do it as others around me at the nightclubs and houses were too. 3 times in 5 months when it was offered.. never seeked it. 

May 2019 my dumbass stepped it up a notch and smoked it again from a tweaker who quit and gave me his pipe.. ever since that day I couldn't stop for 11 months pretty much. I'll never forget that relapse.

This is why I tell people to not think they can do meth and not get addicted!! It took me over ten times of doing it to get hooked but FUCK when I got hooked I got fucking hooked. I was pure recreational for years (if you can even call doing it twice when I was 18 years lol) and then I fucking got hooked and it sucked.

I am 2 months clean now and it's a struggle but man there's nothing better than being able to think clearly and feel relief from anxiety. Experience natural happiness and feel genuine emotion again. If you're thinking about relapsing just please realize it isn't worth it and you're only prolonging the pain for longer. Stay strong, and with enough devotion to your desire to remain or get clean.. you will get better. I literally completely forgot about the drug in those 3 years or so I was clean. I was lucky. But it still got me.. and it *will* get you as well.",27

I‚Äôm interested in those who also have experience with methamphetamine and to a lesser extent heroin, though I know that doesn‚Äôt really apply here.

Some context: I had a light cocaine addiction from 18-19. As a considerably more drug naive person it was powerful and reinforcing, but quite easy to stop after frequent use. 

In my 20s I started shooting heroin, and soon thereafter stopped regular use before I developed physical dependence by replacing it with meth- which became a much more powerful and destructive addiction. 

Anyway- the few times I did coke in my 20s- crack a couple times, a speedball, and one big IV run, I found that it was just deeply unsatisfying and felt like a waste of money. I pretty much always wanted more, could never achieve either the rush or a sustained state that felt anything but insufficient. 

Meth, by contrast, would give me a rush that now, with a half a year of sobriety, I still think about 10+ times a day. And that rush would produce at least a couple hours of a satisfying sustained state. The same is true of heroin, but it really didn‚Äôt do a whole lot for me as an individual and wasn‚Äôt hard to replace. 

Anyways- In recent days it occurred to me that plenty of people take their crack addiction so far as to become junkies. For those who know that meth also exists, I just do not understand how cocaine could be sustained a primary addiction even as you descend into the pits of recklessness and self-disregard that it takes to give your whole life up to the drug. 

Meanwhile, I was about a few months away from taking that plunge with meth before I quit. So my question is: what does cocaine do for you that amphetamines do not? Even if it does something ‚Äúmore‚Äù for you, how does the price differential, in light of a surely significant overlap of desired effect, not supersede that?",2

Looking for personal experiences. Specifically people diagnosed w/ADHD.,"You can read my thing below if you want, its my personal experience with adderall. I'd like to hear any personal experiences with stopping abuse and returning to normal prescribed dosages. have you tried and failed? Succeeded? 

&#x200B;

Heres my dillemma: Got diagnosed with ADHD about three years ago at age 21 and prescribed adderall IR. (60mg per day) For 2 and a half years I stuck to the prescribed dosage almost always. It really made a huge positive impact on my life. Throughout those 2 and a half years I went to community college and for the first time I studied and got good grades....even passing algebra with an A. I did my homework, cleaned my room and car, and got on a healthy sleeping schedule. I ate healthy and exercised regularly. Yada yada. Basically I felt like I was in control for once in my life. Then came New Years...

&#x200B;

On new years eve I was dumped by my girlfriend of 5 years, and essentially kicked out of our house (I wasnt on the lease) and I went home to stay with mom and dad for a while. I was really devestated by the breakup and filled with insecurity. I started to abuse my script shortly afterwards because I found it brought relief from the pain and constantly replaying negative thoughts. I loved that girl so much, and we'd been dating since we were both 18. Adderall gave me a way out of that if I took enough and so I started taking a bit extra just for the ""numbing"" effect of it. I started running out earlier and earlier each time. Spening a couple of weeks on cloud nine writing long philosophical essays, editing photos, applying to jobs etc. and then I'd run out and then would come 2 weeks of misery until refill.   
I would tell myself during the two weeks that I wouldnt abuse it this time, and so on. Then I'd get my script and boom, gone in a week or two. Rinse and repeat. 

&#x200B;

I cant seem to break that cycle even six months later although I'm over the break up. I really wish  Icould go back to just taking it as intended because my life NEEDS that right now more than ever as I'm struggling to get a job and I'm pretty much broke right now, and ADHD isn't making things any easier.",20

I have an extensive list but heres my top ones from my meth addiction..

1. When I overamped new years eve 2019 and went into instant severe.delirium and depersonalization and had terrible tinnitus and ran outside half naked screaming at the top of my lungs running into the neighbor's house whilst forced into a psyc ward.

2. Visits to the ER where I was in severe psychosis and thought I had a dangerous illness.

3. Seeing dead people and hearing children laugh on day 5 after smoking and snorting who knows how much with weed and beers and hallucinating.the family upstairs being invaded and gunned down by the swat and someone hanging themselves.

4. Delirium while at work and trying my best to compose myself.

5. The terrible comedowns and impending doom I had during withdrawal.

6. Relapsing and ruining my trip to Puerto Vallarta with my mom and the severe depression that ensued.

7. Thinking my dealer broke into my house and made a meth lab and crack in my microwave and he was trying to hurt me. I could literally ""smell the meth being cooked"". My landlord and his wife looked at me in disbelief when I told them urging me to go to bed. This one was pretty terrifying.

8. Checking my blood pressure 100 times in a day tweaking bad worrying about a stroke and running around like a chicken.

9. Ruining my 22nd birthday, skipping family parties and work events, calling out of work so I could smoke. Meth, quitting my store management job to party, almost being evicted, risking arrest.

10. Doing the same thing over and over again despite the severe bouts of addiction I had and not being able to stop.

Additional one: Not realizing how many meth sores I made on myself and how fucking obvious I was.. luckily they're healing up well.

Not looking back. For as long as I possibly can fucking help it. Meth fucked me up bad yo and I am 62 days clean today fuck meth!!! üò≠üò≠üò•",55

Lately a lot of past events have been popping in my head and I just cringe at the things I did. Some of the situations I put myself in and the way I acted were just so out of my character. Like I can‚Äôt believe I was so caught up in the dope and so hopeless that I didn‚Äôt care if I lived or died. 

Being found blue on my bathroom floor by my mom and being revived just in time by paramedics. Not once, but three separate times. Jesus Christ if someone didn‚Äôt stumble across me overdosing those three times I‚Äôd be dead. I didn‚Äôt just use speed I did everything, including shooting heroin. 

Having a gun pointed at my head and almost being shot. Not once but twice. What the fuck was I thinking? That‚Äôs not the way my life was supposed to turn out. How did I get to that point? 

I guess it‚Äôs a blessing these memories have not completely faded. It‚Äôs a reminder of what‚Äôs waiting out there for me if I pick up that first drink or drug. 

It‚Äôs truly remarkable that I am still alive. Addiction has devastated so many around me and I hate it. All I have now is contempt, hatred and disgust for my addiction and what it did to me and my loved ones. That was a motivating factor for me to say enough is enough.

I feel lost like I did before I started which caused me to turn to adderall in the first place. After 30 days of being happy and keeping busy a depression has begun to settle in which always triggers a relapse. Please someone help me. The NA meetings just aren't enough right now. I pray and meditate each morning but I feel nothing whilst doing so. Maybe my higher power has abandoned me.",21

I was getting auditory hallucinations the first 4 days off and visuals until day 15. The psychosis on the last day of use was absolute schizophrenia for me... with mobs of shadow people yelling taunts outside, hearing sirens for days and seeing bugs on the walls. I was even seeing 100% realistic looking people which was a new hallucination. It was really fucking scary experience. I've had psychosis over 20 times from meth.

The weeks since I've been dealing with random paranoia and just feel off in society. My social skills were already bad but now I'm just avoidant and stiff around people. Very anxious and quiet.. I want to socialize but my brain cant connect the words to my mouth to speak. My brain feels slower than everyone else's and I cant keep up which only fuels my anxiety further. 

I prefer to be alone constantly and think everyone is against me or conspiring to hurt me somehow, even my wife who I'm convinced is taunting me somehow. My boss who likes me, didn't say hi today at work and I'm thinking he's gonna fire me or knows something I dont. 

I see through the random delusional thinking once it stops but it's been daily occurence for awhile now. On top of the daily cravings which last entire days straight, I'm really struggling to not jump off the wagon. For a few days at a time these symptoms all let up in relief but then comes back on a whim when I wake up on a random morning.",5

I read this today and it has a lot of good insights into recovery. This is , after all , just replacing good habits for bad ones. And we are all human beings fully capable of mistakes. In fact some would argue that mistakes are the only way we truly learn. So don‚Äôt beat yourself up for slipping. It‚Äôs not the slip that matters. It‚Äôs the recognition that you are ok after you‚Äôve fallen and that no one will pick you up except yourself. So don‚Äôt get back up and immediately break yourself down again. Get up and dust off and keep moving forward. There‚Äôs a better life getting closer every day. I promise.

Granted, I'm also cutting down significantly on my drinking which is definitely contributing but in general I feel like I've fallen back into not being interested in anything and my motivation has disappeared.

I still don't really feel the urge to use since rock bottom is still fresh in my mind but I'm eating right, exercising and working on healthy habits like reading and hobbies yet life has gradually slipped back into a dull, monotonous nightmare filled with insufferable people and disconnection from loved ones.

Don't do it. Believe me you will regret it. I sure did after 3.5 years sober.. relapsed, and it was 11 months of hell. Now I'm two months clean almost.

Meth or whatever you're taking will NEVER make your life better in the long run or even short term. Lo ger term sobriety is significant who knows how your brain and body will react to using again. You may just have  a *horrible* trip and freak out. Stimulants are unpredictable.

Trust me when I say this.. you think you feel horrible right now? Wait until you relapse and try to quit again but can't.. you will only feel worse.

Tough it out a bit longer and I can GUARANTEE you will be happier and have a better outcome.

Don't let this bitch get you into using again.. that's what it wants.. and it will destroy your life before your eyes and you will be powerless the second you use again. Remember.. everytime you can claim sobriety you're infact *winning* and truly *in control*.

Would have come home from work, pissed off, had a bottle of wine on top of my amphetamines and probably a shit load of coffee and otherwise empty stomach. would not have called my parents or made any art - neglected my emotional self. and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to sleep. 

I still get really frustrated with myself for my shortcomings and I have a long way to go to be the person I want to be, fully - I want to lose weight and work on my health, I want to be better at getting places on time, etc. but I just needed to take a moment to compare today to what might have been if I hadn‚Äôt made the decision that I did 8.5 months ago. 

Today felt really heavy, but I still feel lucky. I‚Äôm not angry. I‚Äôm calm. Never would have said that on adderall. and I‚Äôm okay with being  calm in a way I didn‚Äôt think I could ever be ok with. I love chaos as much as the next stimulant addict...but it‚Äôs ok to be still sometimes.

I have schizophrenia. Schizophrenia & methamphetamine is a reality-denying, life-destroying combination. But I've been struggling with fantasies lately, and here is what is helping.","*I think often about, looking back on using, the way people looked at me in public.*

I don't think I was doing anything particularly eccentric, but I noticed people *really do* tend to stare, even glare, and can sense something off and subtly, apparent visually, ""undesirable"" about you when you're high in public. This was always so upsetting and other-izing to me, and I am really glad & grateful to be integrating back into society and community (to the best of my capacities, with COVID). It doesn't happen to me anymore. But I remember feeling so *inhuman.* I was already very isolated in my subjective experience because of my mental illness, despite having a life and relationships, & I remember thinking:

*There is no point in ever communicating with anybody because it's so painfully inadequate. All of these people perceive me worse than an animal because I look like a twacked out insane homeless guy, but they can't see that there's a secret poignant beauty, poetry, & hope in me ‚Äî but where has that been lately? I wish instead of judgement, just a single person could see & be witness to how much pain I am in.*

It got to the point, with extreme dysfunction in my family and abruptly being forced to come to terms with childhood sexual abuse, that I lost my mind, in some cold place, (symbolically) fallen to the space in between an alley and a confessional. *I attempted to cut out my tongue.* I was hospitalized against my will ‚Äî again ‚Äî amphetamine psychosis police chase, yada yada the whole gamut. But how fitting that I would try to cut out my *tongue*, that locus of communicable speech. I knew this at the time too. I was ready to sacrifice this useless, worthless, 'lost object', the tongue, because *I fully believed nobody would EVER be able to hear my tragedies and my miracles,* to celebrate the wonder of being itself with me in the medium of speech & language, *to truly communicate their inviolable, immutable self with me.* I believed not only was communication so disgustingly and devastatingly inadequate, I believed I truly had nothing worthwhile to say, ever again.

In the hospital, I got clean. For good. It scared the shit out of me. And I am coming to know communication, even love, as I reconnect wonderfully & strengthen my relationships with old, fondly recalled loved ones.

When I left the hospital, I told the Docs: ""I an ready to commit myself to the world and all its imperfections.""

So, methamphetamine took (temporarily!) my capacity to feel human ‚Äî *I was literally stripped of my own humanity.* After that experience, I realized I do like having a tongue, haha! I am fully human. And I'm staying clean because of this.",73

One of them moved out of state so that was a blessing in disguise, deleted his first.

shortly after i deleted my other dealer's number, the one i would hit up literally every other day. that gave me immense amounts of relief, and to further support that feeling i sent my script for the month straight down the porcelain throne.

I'm tired of being tired of being tired. 

I'm tired of blowing a grand a month on pills that dim the shine in my eyes. 

It was just so easy to use the shelter in place as an excuse to splurge. i remember recognizing my problem a few years ago and thanking God i was not at the point i'd see others' problems at: 300+mg. I would only allow myself to max out at 100mg and that would be rare. I soon found myself maxing my adderall daily usage at 450mg but more than likely popping an average of 200-300mg a day. 

That shit went downhill.. down, down, and even more down, til i burnt out and hit the bottom.. all of this happened so fast. 

What broke my heart the most is going to a family gathering with my immediate family who i hadn't seen in a couple months and my mom asking me over the phone shortly after i got back home if i was okay. i have never felt so much pain in my heart when she said she was concerned about my weight and pointing out how unhealthy i had looked. how sleepless, and skinny i had gotten. 

I knew something had to be done.. and man, how much different i looked 10 days ago and how much more able i am to look at myself in the mirror and be okay with what i see. 

I see the little kid in me that i missed so much, so full of joy and eyes so full of color. i've been glowing so much inside and out. 

I really really really want my life back.

I want this attempt to be the one.

I know it's too much to ask but I really really really want the past 5 years of my life back. 

I really want to keep myself accountable and post here as often as i used to.",18

I met her about 2 months ago, she is homeless and lives in a tent near my work. She is a regular customer that I became fond of. From what she tells me, she has been using for several years. She is 20 now and said she started at 14. I don't know the full history, but she currently shoots it. I can tell that it affects her negatively. I only asked her once prior if she ever considered quitting, and she said that it was ""medicinal"" for her. She is a great person, and she is someone that I have developed a romantic attraction towards. When she is spun out though, she often is very agitated, and mean to people, including myself. When she is withdrawing, she seems very lifeless. It pains me to see her going through this. She is a low level dealer, as a way of affording it, meaning she sells from her personal stash, not like an actual dealer or anything. I can tell that her life revolves around the drug.. I however, can look past that and still love her, even when shes unpleasant. Ultimately though, I don't know how to help her. Like, I mentioned, she is homeless, and I know that that is probably her biggest barrier to even wanting to quit, but I am in a roommate house situation, and they won't allow her to stay here. I don't even know how to approach her about this, because I really don't want to upset her, but I don't want to continue to watch terrible things happen to her. She is often robbed by her so called ""friends"", she has been sexually assaulted several times, and she doesn't seem to care. I've been doing all I can to make her happy, but it doesn't seem to work, or at very best is very short lived. Is there anything I can do for her? Are there any treatment options that would house her during treatment? Is it even possible to help someone that deep into it?

The underlying ADD/reading disability/cognitive, learning, or intellectual deficits that led me to abusing Adderall (which was always prescribed) are still very pronounced, but I‚Äôm committed to getting more time off Adderall bc even though I have doubts about my baseline functioning, I still believe I am not even at my baseline and need more time to let my brain heal.

Anyway, the CMA/AA programs and fellowships have helped me reach 5+ months. And I‚Äôm grateful for that.  However I do hope to find more people who specifically struggle with Adderall and have similar underlying issue specifics to continue to learn and grow in my recovery.

If anyone wants to connect on these topics or if anyone has groups or resources to share where I might find this, please kindly share in the comments or drop me a message",15

My dealer called me yesterday.,"I threw away my burner, but I guess he got my number from somebody. I hope I wouldn't have picked up the phone if I had him as a contact.

I was terrified once I recognized his voice, and while i shot the shit with him i prayed that I would have the resolve to tell him to get bent when he proposed a meetup.

I didn't have to.

Turns out he was calling because he was in the hospital for a meth-caused heart condition and he wanted some sobriety tips.

The call meant a couple things to me, largely validation because I knew that I could have been the man in that bed with a hole in his heart.

Besides that I'm conflicted. The dude needs help staying sober. It's literally a manner of life and death for someone who was a close friend for years.

But I know how fragile my sobriety was for the first weeks and months, andI scared for me and my family if I start talking with this guy to help him and then he gets back into it.",87

In the beginning I felt great - I had finally lost the 5 lbs that wouldn‚Äôt come off, I was more social, and I kicked ass at work. I never had a problem with using because I would take ‚Äúdrug holidays‚Äù every weekend. And then, a few months after I got married in October of 2018, I started trying (unsuccessfully) to get pregnant. My doc said I could stay on it until I got a positive pregnancy test....That was around 1.5 years ago. Now I feel like I‚Äôve dug myself into a hole and have no idea how to get out.

It started with the elimination of the ‚Äúdrug holidays‚Äù. I started taking it daily with no breaks, and at the end of the day I couldn‚Äôt fall asleep so I would drink. It eventually spiraled to a cup of coffee in the morning, two 30mg adderall during the day and a bottle of wine (yes, the whole thing) at night. Up until around 2 months ago, I was feeling fine - I knew I would need to quit the drinking/adderall use but chalked it up to ‚ÄúI‚Äôll quit when I get pregnant, I‚Äôll have a reason so it won‚Äôt be as hard‚Äù but as of about a month ago, I started feeling depressed/hopeless, my adderall doesn‚Äôt even feel like it‚Äôs working at all, and I now have chest pain in the middle of my chest (beneath my sternum). I‚Äôm worried that my health is at risk and I need to quit it all before I completely ruin my chances of ever having a baby. 

Any advice/supplements to try for someone quitting adderall without the help of a medical professional? I don‚Äôt have the extra money right now (thanks, COVID) to consult someone for help but I don‚Äôt know what else to do.",4

And fuck, the anhedonia's coming in real hard.  I allow myself to drink once a week because alcohol is the only thing that feels remotely positive.  I look forward to basically my weekly drinks and sleep:  No satisfaction, motivation or enjoyment from anything else, not even from gaining muscle and working my ass off.  0 desire to socialize, barely anything is funny or interesting.

I was trying to quit earlier this year (see post history) and we actually both ended up quitting cold turkey after my boyfriend realized he has a massive hole in his septum. It scared us both so much and we threw away what we had left and haven‚Äôt done it since.

It helped that we were pretty much stuck at home, we weren‚Äôt tempted to go out which could trigger the desire to get ahold of some coke.

But now that things are opening up again, my boyfriend went to ‚Äúguys night‚Äù and got a ticket for public intoxication in the middle of a highway at 7:45 am yesterday...then he started having a seizure and they figured out he had been doing cocaine and had a blood alcohol level of 0.3.

My guess is that he did his normal amount without thinking about the fact that his tolerance has gone way down after months of being sober.

I thought I‚Äôd share this story because we didn‚Äôt even think we were too bad of users until realizing how much he‚Äôd destroyed his nose. You think you‚Äôre being safe or that it won‚Äôt happen to you, but it will.

Now he‚Äôs got mounds of hospital bills and a very angry girlfriend who had to go pick up his phone at the bar he was last at, only to find out he was with some other girl when all this was happening.

So, quitting rocks because not quitting means thousands of dollars in hospital bills, a court date, an expensive ticket, and a devastated girlfriend.

Thanks for letting me half vent, half share this cautionary tale.

Edit: I‚Äôd also love any advice from anyone who has experienced anything similar (seizures, relapsing, etc.). He thinks he‚Äôs totally fine (because he doesn‚Äôt remember it) but the hospital is really worried and has had him there for tons of tests.

Plus, he was laid off due to COVID last month, so they stopped his health insurance at the end of May. Does anyone have any advice for handling this without insurance?",4

I'm an addict at heart and I just really need to share this with someone. I've been lurking this sub for a few weeks. I got clean from alcohol and cocaine 44 days ago, with tremendous thanks to r/stopdrinking, and found out about this sub. (TLDR at the end)

I ended up here because I screened positive for ADHD, but kind of skirted past a diagnosis due to anxiety and depression from a young age. Oh yeah, and thanks to MDMA binges in my early 20's, yikes. Anyways, my doctor is a notorious pill pusher. I know this. It's been the scenario for years. When I was still using alcohol and cocaine, I wanted to get my hands on a script for recreational use more than anything. After I got clean, I got the script. Horrible timing. I was about two weeks into sobriety, just finished Alcohol Explained and feeling like I had my life changed - more prepared than I've ever been in my life to live sober. 

Queue dexedrine. 

It started off as 10mg in the morning. I have used it recreationally quite a few times (amazing for staying up all night dancing at raves and festivals), and love the euphoric rush. It's gotten out of hand. Eventually manipulated the doctor up to a 30mg a day dose.... But I was going through it... Quick. The last month's script... Not even a week. 

I've been fucking scared shitless. It's only been a few weeks of this but I don't want to slip into another gruesome addiction like I had with Alcohol and cocaine. I almost didn't make it out alive. I was lurking here tonight and saw a post about flushing them. I've thought about it time and time again just could never bring myself to get through with it. The post said do it. Don't think about it...

So I flushed them. The remainder of the bottle. I can kick this, I WANT to kick this. The freedom I feel from the chains of alcohol and cocaine is a goddamn blessing everyday and I'm so grateful. I know I can achieve that. It was so fucking hard to flush those pills... But I've thought about doing it every single day. I'm not me on dexedrine, I'm not authentic. 

We all deserve to be free. 
Here's to my first day one - and whatever day you're on. Thank you for reading if you got this far.

TLDR; sober from drugs and alcohol! screened positive for ADHD. Started dexedrine. Got out of hand with the script, up to 100(or more)mg a day. The script barely lasted me a week this last binge. I flushed them. I'm ready to get back to the real sober me.

Weeks go by. I get a random craving, go for it and binge like crazy. The binges are unpleasant and not really euphoric at all, mostly compulsive.

 I feel kind of like shit because i was doing a lot better and I'm just ashamed. My mind keeps switching between ""this isn't a problem at all.

Background: I used adderall for a few years but only during finals with multiple months between a single dose and never took more then 10MG. That all changed in late 2018. I (ab)used Adderall (IR and XR) from around October 2018 to May 2020, I spent over 10k on pills during this stretch. My worst stretch was right before I quit where I had an 8 day binge. I slept maybe 2 or 3 times for under 6 hours in that span, I think I had around 2600mg (96ish 30MG IR pills and 27 10MG XR pills). 

Phase 1 (Days 1-3)

* These weren‚Äôt even that tough to go through but I had absolutely ZERO energy. I took half a spoon of Nyquil to sleep twice (but honestly that was stupid cause its not like I needed help falling asleep), and slept 17ish hours out of 24 if I had to guess. When I was awake I ate like a fucking mad man and reality felt fake (for lack of better words). Everything felt like a dream, very foggy and I didn‚Äôt do anything at all. 

Phase 2 (Days 3-9)

* This might have been the worst 6 days of my life. I felt like absolute SHIT, depressed out of my mind and everything in my life came with the most pessimistic outlook. I was still sleeping 13-15 hours but now when I woke up I had enough energy to think about all the regret I built up. I had to come to terms that I threw away 1.5ish years of my life. I was overly emotional and spent most of the time watching addiction recovery videos. On Day 9 I started working out.

Phase 3 (Day 10-Now)

* In the past couple of days I finally started waking up before 12pm but I still sleep around 10-12 hours a day, not really pushing to wake up early cause I wanna completely catch up on sleep and I know that takes time. The difference between phase 2 and 3 was I finally feel optimistic about my future and I‚Äôve been completely healthy. I go on a hike every day, I do calisthenics and I'm actively planning for the future. I still have periods of extreme anxiety and regret but I have less brain fog and feel a little like I did before I started abusing.

Supplement Im taking: 

* B12 Energy Gummies in the Morning
* 2 Multivitamins (OneADay)
* Powder Mix of vegetables/fruits/antioxidants 
* Melatonin at Night

I didn‚Äôt go to rehab so Ive kinda been using this account as a way to motivate myself to stay sober by reading posts and trying to help. Writing this short article type motivates me to have a productive day today so if anyone needs/wants to talk or ask and questions Im all for it.",13

Man I love being fucked up and smoking cigarettes.i feel like I‚Äôm on a slippery slope. I was obsessing about my past before I relapsed last time . I had about 8 months. Now I have 6",6

I had over 10 years of sobriety and relapsed several years ago. The longest amount of time I‚Äôve gotten sober since then is six months. I keep relapsing about that time and it happened again two weeks ago. 

I planned the whole thing out, how I would lie, and how it was okay for me to do so. Now that I‚Äôve done the deal for two weeks (which seems like an eternity), I‚Äôve decided I want to stop again, but I‚Äôm not sure that I‚Äôm done. This leads me to ask myself ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with me?‚Äù

Truth is that I lost hope several years ago when I first relapsed. No excuses but several very traumatic things happened in my life: a death, a divorce, a very sick loved one. I don‚Äôt want to get too specific but a couple of instances happened with people with significant sobriety time that also traumatized me and left me with a resentment I chose to keep and still apparently have against 12-step. I think it‚Äôs blocking me from recovering in program because I no longer trust ‚Äúthose people‚Äù.

I‚Äôm not a victim. I believe every day is a choice. I also deal with depression and PTSD so I get treatment for that. I have a therapist who doesn‚Äôt know I relapsed.

I feel stuck. Not sure I want to get sober and not sure I want to stay loaded. Miserable/discontent either way and it appears that 12-step is no longer helping solve the problem. I‚Äôd like to find out from all of you how to get and stay sober another way. Thank you for your help.

Edit: I‚Äôve been to rehab before",22

Or more concisely put... is there anyone in this subreddit conflicted with low dose Vyvanse and sober living, and would like to share their experience on what worked for them? Posting in this subreddit because I believe in this reddit's philosophy given my history of drug abuse, and because [r/ADHD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/) seems more often to be pro-medication than not.

The plug really liked me since I‚Äôm a young dude, naturally energetic and enthusiastic, etc. So I got all the free dope in the world whenever I wanted. I never ran out. I was spun every day. Every. Day. I couldn‚Äôt maintain the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need drugs to be happy‚Äù mindset for longer than 2 hours. 

2 weeks ago I ran out. Oh my god I still am shitting all this shit out and I feel like garbage. My asshole is constantly on fire for a good 20 minutes whenever I take a shit. I still get crazy dreams, crazy ass sugar cravings, and I have no desire to reintroduce sex back into my life. Last night I had a dream that the entire crew at my work including me all had to dive into the ocean and sleep for 100 years. Similar to Aang‚Äôs situation in the last airbender. There was no huge point to the dream, we just had to go to sleep for a very long time and I don‚Äôt know why üíÄ AnyWho, emotionally I‚Äôm doing pretty OK. Of course I still have cravings and I know that nothings going to rock me the way dope does. But yeah, this is kind of my update on how I‚Äôm doing two weeks in after my 3 month long meth binge.",3

I'm 25 years old and I felt completely disgusted with meth and with myself as well (I still do). 

When COVID was just starting I purchased 100 meth pipes ""just in case""... Pretty exaggerate I know but wise on the long run (""wise"" sure, lmao). Tomorrow I may trash those 95 left as that box is starting to dust. 

I'm not sure how many of you here have presented any noticeable physical changes after using this. I eat well and about 3-4 times a day, even on meth I can't stop craving on tacos or similar stuff, I love food and fruits as well, plus I take vitamins + omega-3 as I know meth goes hard on my body so I never noticed any PHYSICAL change (I was not losing weight, skin still looks good) but after looking at my teeth I KNOW FOR SURE that is enough for me not even wanting to smoke it again. It was 6 months almost non-stop, I cant believe it myself, no benzos either... I might still want to get some of those tho as my humor was not the best on the first days after quitting and I just like the occasional benzo. 

P.D.: this is only about my physical health... Meth definitely f*cks with your head since the first days no matter what, at least I think so, but most people wont notice or admit it. Edit: Any tips for the black dot removal?",2
