Recovery is possible y’all. Stay strong.","Grateful for the inspiration and support that I receive from this group. Thank YOU!

It has been a strange 11 months— pandemic plus recovery. I feel like I have been in hiding and now it is time for me to emerge from my cave. I have to return to work in-person in a few months. I am anxious about being able to perform sans stims without the cover of zoom. I am also anxious about the amount of weight I have gained. I keep chipping away each day with healthy choices, slow and steady. Last week I started going to Acupuncture it felt amazing. If you have an acupuncture school or cheap community acupuncture near you, I highly recommend. I am open to anything that will help rebalance my system. 

Overall I am functional. I have slow days. I am craving more social interaction and natural stimulation. I am down to 8oz of half decaf coffee and 2 cups of green tea a day. I was leaning on caffeine hard these past months, I dont recommend cold turkey for caffeine at all!

Please share your progress. I want to hear how YOU are doing.",40,1

I feel like I never get anything done. I am working so hard and have nothing to show for it. It takes literally every ounce of energy I have just to keep myself from drowning. How will I ever move forward in my life??

For example, yesterday it took me an entire hour to make a cucumber salad. I had to slice 3 cucumbers, 2 onions, and mix some vinegar with some sugar. And somehow it took me an hour. 

I fucking hate ADHD so much. I would do anything to have a normal brain. I wish I had never abused my medication because I do *actually need* it. But I fucked it up for myself, snorting it, taking potentially lethal doses all the time. Now I can’t have medication that I need because I won’t stop fucking around with it. 

I need to put away my laundry. I need to take a shower. I need to text back my friends. I need to brush my teeth. I need to change my sheets. I don’t know what I do all day. I feel like I am working *so hard* and I have nothing to show for it. I spend so much of my day walking in circles. Everything is so fucking overwhelming. I am so tired of just failing, over and over and over again.

I used to work boring, labour-intensive jobs that treated me less than human and I used meth quite regularly the whole time. Usually it was an escape on my days off. Sometimes it carried over to my days on too. I lacked any meaningful or enjoyable activites in my life because all my energy and time was consumed with working. I became incredibly depressed and cynical as a result. Nothing could change these feelings or allow me to fully escape from them except for meth. It was my coping mechanism and allowed me to enter a state where I was so engrossed and entertained in what I was doing that it was impossible to think about my depressing life.

I fell into a trap, a cycle, of using meth to escape my problems, which worsened them, then using meth to escape them even more. I knew what I was doing but I didn't care. I resigned to the opinion that there was nothing I could do to fix my life.

After 2 years of living like this, and working an overly demanding and frankly inhumane job, I quit my job. I wasn't living, I was dying and I was being seperated further and further from my humanity. On top of this, I withdrew from Xanax while working, which was the hardest thing I've done in my life. I was burned out, I didn't care about working anymore, I just needed rest.

After having time at home to relax and be away from my toxic workplace, I found that my usual meth cravings were completely absent. I've only used meth one time since, while attending a swingers party (story for another time), but that usage was born out of intent, not craving. It's been almost 2 months and I still have no desire to do meth and even refused it when offered it by a friend (unthinkable) without hesitation. I always knew work was causing me to use but I didn't realise that it was 90% of the equation.

Anyway, I'm doing better these days and I just wanted to share my experience. I hope anyone going through addiction finds the peace they deserve.",37,0

I'm a sad depressed loss of hope when I'm the worst version of myself. I know I can do better when I dont think of sobriety as anything but the greatest way to live. 

I'm moving states in a month with my family after living in the same town my whole life. I'll be moving to a farm from a decently big town.. On that farm I'm going to be staying in a popup trailer on the property with my family close by. I have kept my problems as secret as I can. My dad knows everything he's aware of what he should be, but his girl friend is honestly as dumb as they get. I am more than excited for the day I get to get a new start. I'll be with my little brother who's been in Juvy a year and a half he can only get out if we move or when he turns 18 (currently 16), and my sister who has been the only sibling around lately. Big brother is 24 facing 7 years after three years of living on the streets. 

I'm not good with all that I need to say because I never express feelings anytime, anywhere, anymore. Football concussions really did a number on me also while in high school. I like giving good news out, I just dont usually have much but I try to be the best me.

Idk how else to describe it. I just remember talking about how I felt like everything was in a black and white film. I also got very very dark and suicidal often. 

Now, I’ve been clean for a year and a half, and suddenly have realized that, recently, things are “colorful” again. I can be happy for no reason, but that’s just it, there’s no reason to be happy. It feels like I’m watching life through a tv screen. There’s no substance to it at all. All of the relationships I have are now very superficial. I used to have deep convos with people. I used to have sultry encounters, with a boyfriend, or with other guys if I was single. I was swimming in male attention, in excitement, etc. 

Now, granted, I’m now 30, but surely that can’t change things that much. Yes, I’ve gained a little bit of weight, but I’m certainly not overweight. My ex even told me I look better, and is shocked that I never get hit on. I’m not just unsatisfied about the lack of intimate relationships, but as I’ve progressed in my sobriety and been single for so long, it starts to make you question, “what’s wrong with me now?” Surely, I didn’t love myself on stims, so I don’t think it’s the whole “lack of self-love,” however, as time has gone on I find myself feeling less and less relationship-oriented. I don’t feel sexy at all, but also, I don’t feel much affinity towards anything. Within the past few months, I’ve tried to establish friendships, and a lot of people usually like me, but nothing seems to go anywhere really, nor am I even sure I usually want it to. 

I’m sure it doesn’t help that during my addiction I pretty much blew up my personal life, but now it’s like there is no place for me anymore, whereas opportunities seemed to endlessly present themselves in the past. 

Before I became an addict, I struggled with depression and dark thoughts as well, but there was still a buzz of energy, sexual or otherwise about me. So, it wasn’t just the drugs making my life exciting. Surely, it contributed but this also doesn’t feel normal. However, if I get any more ordinary, I might have to blow my brains out.

Started off with pit and alcohol then after my 3rd son was born I got into opioids. I did a outpatient IOP and when my days were done I picked up weed as soon as I could and the cycle continued for 3 months. My mom knew something was up right away and got me back in rehab inpatient for 5 weeks. This was 2015

I have done pills a couple times since then, but always stopped on my own. Now I have been addicted to ADHD meds and caffeine for 2 years. 

I hate myself and the person I have become. My tollance to ADHD meds is sky rocket so my script only lasts maybe a week.it has also gotten to the point I am not productive either. I was diagnosed with ADD when I was 5. Medicated all through school. I know it's not all in my head. I really do suffer with doing every day tasks. 

I tried non stimulant medicine, but it doesn't work. 

Here I am 33 years old, mom to 3 boys. And totally lost in life. I abuse caffeine as well because if I don't I could seriously sleep all day. My just one engery shot, 5 hour, use to keep me up all night. Now I can take 3 and go to sleep. 

No one knows I am struggling but me and the devil himself. My mental health has gone to shit. Depression and anxiety. My entire house is a shit show. I can't seem to get it cleaned up. Mainly because I don't have the energy or focus to do it. Dirty dishes take over my kitchen. no dishwasher so I hate washing. I got behind one week and am now going on a month trying to catch up. 

Laundry is bad, floor needs mopped, everything is a. Shit. Show. But here I am, I got everything under control right? No. I seriously can't go back to rehab. My husband is 18 years older than me, he can't watch my kids. I can't tell my mom because I will just break her heart again. I don't want to watch her cry again knowing I fucked up again. 

My kids sure as hell don't deserve this. I am the scum of the earth. I take care of them and love them to death, but I am failing them. They have no idea how shitty their mom is.

15,2021-05-27 14:48:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/nmehpt/it_really_does_get_better/,It really does get better.,"I know most people on this sub have been using speed way longer than I have, but I just wanted to share something to serve as a at least a bit of encouragement. I’ve been taking (on average) 40mg of Adderall IR a day for the past three years straight. I have a prescription, but sometimes I go overboard and take 50mg-60mg a day and run out early. This time, I ran out nearly two weeks before my next script was due to be refilled. I was terrified at first, because I had no idea how I was going to make it even two days without a single dose let alone nearly two weeks. However, I’m about six days in, with a few more to go before my refill, and I can honestly say that I feel like I’m overall at a solid 90%. I’m completely sober as of writing this and it literally feels like I’m on a 10mg dose of Adderall, only naturally.

And that’s after three years of taking it with barely any breaks in between! My point here is, though it’s different for everybody, if you can push yourself up to about a week without taking any speed and get past all the lethargy, grogginess, sluggishness, fatigue, and antisocial tendencies (what have you) that come with withdrawal, you will feel like you’re on a low dose of speed all the time while sober (though maybe just a little less “speedy”). In other words, recovery time may feel like an eternity, but once you do, it gets so much better. When I get my script refilled, I might actually use this as an opportunity to finally start taking it more responsibly and in moderation as opposed to every day. That way, I’ll never run out early, and I’ll avoid getting as hooked as I was before! Best of luck to all of you, you got this!",5,0

So I used pretty much every day for a year +. Been trying to quit now for almost a year with serious clean time-3/4 month stints with short 1-2 week relapses. Anyways, I moved home with my folks who were gracious enough to have me and my guinea pigs lol, pretty much lost everything else in my life including my gf of 4 years which fucking hurts, she tried so hard to help but I did things in my addiction that really gave her no choice but to leave. Anyways, I’m on day two so I’m just exhausted in bed and I know that this is the easy part. I’ve wanted to quit before but I guess I didn’t put recovery first and foremost, so here we are. I used while moving and packing because I lied to myself and said it would be a good idea( obviously that’s fucking dumb) but I was honest with my folks last night about it, and it was hard but I knew it was the right thing to do. So I am going to attend NA meetings in  person once I feel human again, I’m taking supplements to detox and whatnot, I’m going to start exercising once I can stay awake for long enough, and I’m committed to complete abstinence of all mind altering substances ( coffee and cigarettes excluded for now) 
I’m also going to start seeing a shrink in thd next few weeks so I can figure out what caused my substance abuse( nothing jumps out at me) and I’m going to start a job thats easy and stress free and in a completely different field than I have been in my adult life. Lastly I’m not going to seek out a relationship or sexual partner until I’m feeling solid in my recovery. Lastly fir real, after I’m confident in sobriety, I’m going to start attending classes in addiction counselling because I feel that it will give me purpose that I have never felt with other jobs.

I was smoking weed several times per week since last June. I felt the heavy brain fog, fear of going outside, inability to do basic errands like shopping for myself, and just general apathy become too much. I wanted to quit weed since August, but I had so much around and Covid was a great excuse to keep using. Finally decided this is the month. Stopped for 2 weeks with the help of CBD/CBN, and man did I feel AWFUL. My blood sugar got all out of whack with severe hypoglycemia episodes, and my mood was really foul.  

During this time I found myself craving redosing my ADHD meds, trying to make up for the lack of THC. I started staying up too late and my body started feeling miserable.

I decided this wasn't going to end well, so I told a trusted relative that I was abusing my meds, and gave them all of my bottles to hang on to, and instructed them to dispense less than my daily dose to me each week and to keep me honest.

The next week, I refilled my bottle without telling them and immediately popped my prescribed dose. I kept my senses about, overcame the temptation, and told them I refilled it. I gave them the new bottle, and reiterated how I wanted them to be dispensed.

I decided to vape a bit of weed at the 2 week mark, just to help with the symptoms I was having. (That worked, and now 5 days off bud again the symptoms are more manageable.)

At the beginning of the week, I had the relative give me one half-dose for each day of the week, with the idea that I could use them however I wanted as long as I only used that amount total during the week. Well, my cravings were still pretty high, so I ended up taking the first dose on one of my designated off days. 

That was a poor choice overall, but at least I used it somewhat productively. But funnily the productive things ended up taking longer than normal since I paid too much attention to detail and was OCD about how I did everything (I think we've all been there lmao).

The following 2 on-days, I took took double my planned daily dose, thereby running out of my total weekly allotment- 3 days early.

Today I'm all out of meds and have just been laying in bed all morning. Haven't done a single ounce of work other than attending a meeting and replying to a single email. Yesterday when I was amped up I worked constantly through the entire day. Which is actually rare lol.

I wanted to dose so badly today that I scoured through all my cabinets hoping for the odd dropped pill. I know there isn't one anywhere, but that didn't stop me from looking.  I settled on taking some caffeine pills instead. But they aren't motivating me to work - I just feel like typing this mindlessly instead, lol.

The odd thing with this addiction is that I very, very rarely abused my script, and usually took *less* than prescribed. Even then, it's causing me harm. I can't function normally without it. I'm having cravings that have led to dishonest behaviour, inappropriate redosing,  and manically searching for lost pills.

And the worst part is that my script doesn't make me that productive half of the time. It often just makes me want to browse reddit, watch YouTube, and play video games. When it does make me productive, I spend more time on pointless tasks and often get less ACTUAL work done than before starting this script.

Oh also, it seems like I'm almost dependent on it for pooping. I always have to poop when it kicks in, and I feel constipated if I don't take it.

I have gained nothing but the illusion of productivity while on it, and the loss of productivity and happiness while off it.

Even knowing this, I can't wait for my next dose. It won't make me happy, it probably won't make me productive in the way I tell myself it will, and it won't bring any good. overall.

What am I to do? Use the self control I have and the help of my relative to gradually come out of it. The craving self in me doesn't want to quit, but my deepest inner self knows it's the best decision. So, I put my trust in that inner voice, knowing that I can get through this. And loving myself no matter what happens.  I'm sure I'll have more cravings, some relapses, but I won't hate myself. Like a child that doesn't know any better, I'll hold my own hand and forgive myself, gently walking myself out of this pit. Things will get better. I have my whole future to look forward to.",8,1

That is until I hurt my back and now am completely set back. 
Today was the worst. A culmination of all my anger, depression, pain, severe lack of sympathy for myself (and anyone else), fogginess, and general negative outlook on life. When will it ever get better? I’ve been attempting to take 30+ minute walks, gardening when I had the time, eating healthier and doing all the things to no avail and now am bed ridden due to a herniated disc.
I feel completely alone in this war, and yet hate everyone for it. My friends and family are trying to be supportive but they just don’t get it. Sorry if this is triggering to anyone. I think I just need to hear some supportive words. Any inspiring words or books that helped y’all through something similar?",4,0

Why, you may ask? Well. I had a very bad depressive episode that was brought up by a number of symptoms and one of the most excruciating ones was inability to concentrate, execute and plan.

I had a psych eval and he diagnosed me ADHD-I, gave me a script for the lowest dose of adderall, and I left. 

I never once abused adderall but I vaguely remember that the comedowns were atrocious. I may have gas-lighted myself into thinking that it was primarily WEED causing my anxiety but i'm really not sure.

And I apologize for the length and for repeating myself, the speed still hasn't worn off. 

I just did speed last night still haven't slept so it still hasn't worn off completely and even tho i enjoyed it and i like the comedown i wanna take a break from it. Honestly I would love to reduce it to couple of times a year but even if just for a little while would be enough. Now i started doing speed this year and i used to do it every 3-4 weeks with my friends and we always do it on Saturday night and only then. We never go for a binge. But lately we have moved it up to every 2 weeks and we all agree that for us that's too frequent and we all agreed on taking a break from it for some time. But it's not like when we didn't do speed that we were sober. Most of times we would get wasted, on very rare occasions we took ecstasy, rarely weed you'll understand why rarely, we even took some epilepsy pills one time cuz this girl offered us(i don't remember a lot of that night after taking that). Now I did drink before but I used get drunk or high a few times a year. But this year I think I can count on one hand the number of weekends I wasn't wasted or fucked on some drugs. Same thing goes for most of my friends. And that's why I want to go sober for just a few weeks so I can take breaks after I get either drunk or high one weekend. I should mention that I'm 20 turning 21 in a few weeks and all of my friends are similar age, 18-21. Now here's my problem, so our friend group is large but we are only all together on weekends, it's like a bunch of smaller groups that all hang out with each other on Saturdays. Now the friends that I do speed with are like my main group and we do hang out once or twice a week during work days, but those times are usually during the day and we don't drink or do drugs on those days since some of us have work, others are students... But every Saturday all of the groups come together and we have a party at my best friend's house. There's usually around 20 people most weekends.

And before anyone says anything about rona, the area we live in has had 12 cases total since December of 2019 and plus if anyone is a little sick they either skip that weekend or get tested before they come.

Now like any house party there's separate areas right the dancefloor where most people party, the hallway to talk with others but still vibe and hear the music, the chill room for people who aren't that much into parties but still want to hang out on a Saturday night with their friends or they just don't fuck with the music choices that night, and there's the bathroom for people throwing up and doing drugs and the outside for people who need fresh air and for those who are having private or serious conversations. Now I usually spend most nights on the dancefloor since I just want to party with my people but when I need to regain my composure I go into the hallway or when I'm on speed I go outside when I fall into one of those speed convos with someone. But I don't spend much time in the chill room cuz I just get bored quickly and feel like I'm wasting my night and i don't hang out in the bathroom unless I hooked up with someone. So I almost always need to consume something cuz to me Saturdays is what I live for. I spend the whole week looking forward to Saturday and when I'm bored or I'm not doing something that I feel like i would enjoy more(partying usually) like I said I feel like I'm wasting the day that I've been looking forward to for the whole week. And I can't party unless I'm drinking or doing drugs because without those I can probably party for like an hour because that's how long my ""peak"" lasts like where my mood is good and it gets better till I peak and I can maintain that for a little while it won't last long and I won't be able to keep up with the others that are drinking or on drugs and so my mood will slowly deteriorate until I realize that that was the peak of my night and feel like shit and disappointed and I'll still have a lot of hours until I can leave. Oh yeah and I forgot to mention our Saturdays go from 21h to at least 3-4am the next day. And for most that's because cabs and ubers are really expensive here like they 8x the price of trains and buses, so we can't leave most nights when we want and we have to wait for the earliest bus or train. 

And so I wrote all of this for this simple question, how do I enjoy my Saturday sober without being bored or feeling like I'm wasting it? Now the only idea that I have is poker night. Cuz it lasts long and there's something to keep us entertained. But we can only do that once in a while or it would get boring pretty quick. So if any of you have any ideas or advice please enlighten me.",2,1

My adhd has been seriously impacting my life and last fall I started taking vyvanse to help and everything changed instantly.  I paid our bills on time and I made appointments without forgetting that I made them.  I was a functioning wife and mom again!

I used to be really addicted to IV crack and heroin and because of this, I take methadone from a clinic and have been clean from all illicit drugs since 2016.  My life was great but the methadone makes me kinda sleepy and has erased my sex drive completely.  My husband has been miserable from our lack of intimacy and we had to start going to marriage counseling because my body is broken.

I noticed a few months ago that I always feel best after I take my vyvanse so like the genius that I am, i would take an extra one to combat my lethargy.  An extra one felt great Holy Crap! So I started taking more and more and .....well I ended up blowing through my refills in a couple of days.

Since I was utterly useless and borderline suicidal for the 2 or 3 weeks that I was out I would supplement with amphetamine that I bought online.  I eventually ended up with a high tolerance and now I don't feel any euphoria or even more awake with any of it.  I have been thinking that I need something stronger so I was looking online and was about to order some meth so I could put it in capsules.......and then I had a moment of clarity...

What am I doing?  

I am a stay at home mom that is responsible for two very small children that depend on me.  I started taking extra so I wasn't useless and so I would be able to be a good wife and mom.  I feel like if I order that then i have crossed a line and am risking something happening that could potentially separate my kids from me.

I took a few extra vyvanse tonight and i didn't feel anything other than guilt and shame and despair. (I actually feel MORE tired) I feel like if I can quit NOW, I can reverse what I have done and I still have the potential to be a good mom. If I place that order than I don't know what might happen.

Tomorrow i am stopping it all.  They deserve better and so do I. I feel like I'm at a crossroads and alone and scared.",40,0

So I pose a question, how do you build your acceptance “muscle”? How did you build that up? What helps you train this ability?

Thoughts?

**Update**: 

So what’s been helping so far the most has been: every second become mindful my current everything (shitty feeling, thoughts, but also where I am, how my body feels, what I’m looking at) and **commanding myself to accept that moment.**  Yesterday I was hella depressed and even felt slightly suicidal, but then I tried to accept where I was in the moment, then I kept doing this (mindfulness of moment + acceptance of that moment) *every second*.

It hasn’t been easy at all. This comes on the heels of a weekend where 4 people have died in my city/neighborhood due to a batch of fentanyl laced coke going around. The bars in my neighborhood are offering NARCAN and classes on how to administer. 

It made me reflect on the last time my city had a big fent scare. At the time I was using, I was literally so unbothered by the news. Looking back on this period is so sad for me. I thought “well that sucks but it won’t happen to me”. I remember when the news came out I went and bought a ball from a guy I had never bought from because some acquaintances mentioned it was safe. How dumb was that? It’s crazy how much coke and addiction warp your brain. I was only concerned with my next high, so much so I wasn’t thinking about the fact that I could very likely get a bad bag and die. To me, that seemed impossible. 

It’s hard to explain this rationale to friends that are still using. I’m so worried that one of them will OD. I had to stop because I had a health scare where thought I was having a heart attack. Slowed breathing, resting heart rate up to 175, pain in my arms and chest. I’m so thankful I had that reality check because I would honestly still be using if I didn’t. I was scared straight. 

This is just a ramble but a friendly reminder that if you’re contemplating stopping, I urge you to taper off and quit while you have the freedom and agency to. Don’t let a heart attack or fentanyl take that choice from you. You’re stronger than you know.

I'm 2 years sober from an Adderall prescription. I never abused my prescription once. I took the usual 30 mg a day every day for a few years. Toward the tail-end, I got tons of anxiety that made me rather dysfunctional. I was able to get through a dead-end job, all fueled through amphetamines. Most of my grades in under-grad that I performed well in were under the influence of studying on amphetamines.

Well why did I quit? Simple, the anxiety was getting intense. I would have intruding thoughts and repeat things that I knew weren't the real 'me'. And I was slowly but surely losing an 'integral' part of my identity.

I never got in trouble with the law. I never harmed anybody else. The only bad thing that happened was my relationship with my family was very strained.

Two years later, I'm faced with the bitter disappointment that although I quit adderall, my problems are still very much there. I applied to medical school and got waitlisted. I was 100% sure I was going to get accepted if I got sober. Evidently, not. 

Andddd my current state remains: I'm at home, applied to a graduate program and start classes in 2 weeks. I'm on Wellbutrin as an anti-depressant for 2 weeks but I'm not sure if that will suffice. 

**I know i'm forgetting some of the 'bad' but my brain rationalized that 30 mg of adderall couldn't possibly be THAT bad. It's only the people who ABUSE it that get in trouble. Is this fallacious?**",3,0

For a while it really helped me just sit down and focus because I couldn’t even hold down an office job before that. But now I have a better (and more interesting) job where I could probably sustain my focus without meds. The problem is that without the Ritalin I feel very restless, almost agitated. I took 10mg yesterday and none today. I usually drink a lot of caffeine with my meds too, even more when I don’t take them. I straight up fiend for coffee and soda when I don’t have Ritalin. But the restlessness is killing me. I can’t just settle down. Makes working feel impossible. Is this withdrawal? How long does it last?",3,0

""I feel awful right now, you'd expect it to be emotionally/ from guilt but honestly my body hurts far more. Every joint and muscle aches like nothing else.

Yesterday felt just as bad although lack of motivated was replaced by constantly getting distracted, and being scatterbrained. When I slept I had bad dreams, I know I'll be having nightmares for the next week.  


It takes so long for you to recover, it takes a week to stay feeling yourself again. 1 week of intense cravings, 2 before they start to die down. 1 month before it becomes easy to ignore, and several months before it becomes a distant memory, and you wondered why you ever thought you needed it.  

&#x200B;

That's where you want to be. You still remember what it was like when you felt good about being clean. When you genuinely didn't want to go back, when it was easy to dismiss a stray thought or memory of using.   


You always forget how you feel afterwards but keep going through with it again and again. You asked yourself why you keep ending up here. Well, why? Why do you keep putting yourself through so much pain. It's the worst thing you can possibly put yourself through. It makes you feel so sad when all you want is to be happy.   


You can get through this, you can get back to 8 months and beyond. Just keep going. You've done it once so you know it's possible. """,20,0

Had months away from the stuff. Everything was great. Always been a complex relationship. Cocaine is strange, different. Very different than other amphs. A seemingly glamorous rollercoaster that everyone in the big city seems to do. 

I was always allergic to the stuff. Loved it, but wasn't a great user. Alcohol, excessive spending, women and nightclubs downtown were always involved. Then it became involved in watching the big fight with friends - even during casual meetups. However, for me at least. The comedowns were so unbearable I would drink through them and find myself in an alcohol bender. Trying to fight the anxiety issues already inherent within me, cocaine did not help

I wanted to prove I wasn't so weak. I bought a bag for a few occasions. Unlike before, I was not finishing the bag. This turned out to be an awful development!

Why? Because I always had some in the drawer. New routine. Have a few drinks, open the drawer on a Friday, enjoy a line. Realize the baggy is light and buy some more. Only a do a bit. Leave the rest in the drawer.

Any coke user knows the nature of the drug. It's one where you keep going. It lasts shortly. Coming up is fast, so is coming down. If you have it in your drawer all it takes is one moment of ""fuck it"" and you are having a session. 

Like lays chips, you can't just have one.

Yesterday, I continued from the night before. This morning, filled with regret and anxiety, I realized I left some amazing shit in the drawer. Scaly, crumbly, pure shit. I picked it up, went to the toilet, and flushed it. It is one thing to call a dealer and make that choice.

 But having readily available stuff, well that just shouldn't be in my life. 

Hopefully, this is goodbye for some time. But to be honest I must admit. I love cocaine. But it's a toxic fucking relationship.",2,0

Took about 150mg of Adderall over the last 24 hours. Now I'm coming down I'm in so much pain, and I'm so anxious.

I started doing adderall (and vyvanse) when I was in college, maybe about 4 years ago now. For a year or so, it took a heavy toll on my health, I wasn't sleeping, I was always anxious, I ended up getting hooked on the benzos I used to come down... it was a nightmare.

Eventually, I straightened up my act and got off adderall for several months. This was back in 2019.

Since then I keep going through the same pattern every few months, and it goes like this:

1. Two or three months of sobriety from Adderall
2. After a long enough time, get the sense that I've beaten my addiction, giving me a false sense of security. 
3. Then, some high priority, high stress task comes up. Usually something related to my job. And time and again I make the very stupid decision to take some Adderall again. I tell myself it's just a couple pills and only enough to help me get my work done for a day or two.
4.  After successfully using Adderall to deal with my work, I begin to feel like maybe I don't have to be as strict about my usage and I can use it to have fun.
5. As soon as I hit step 4, I'm destined to land myself in a shitty spot like the one I find myself in this morning. I'll end up taking time off work to recover from drugs, or I'll have to cancel plans with friends that I was genuinely looking forward to. My sleep schedule gets utterly obliterated. My body feels like shit. I begin to feel way more addicted and cravings come back... and I feel depressed because it's like all the time I took off Adderall ultimately wasn't enough to kick the habit for good.

My history with it was brief but intense. Two years ago I used it for a month, only 10-20mg insufflated each morning to get me through school and the four jobs I had at the same time. Then I didn't touch it again until the beginning of April, and used it until I graduated the weekend before last. Only this time, I was railing 100mg lines up to 3 times per day. I tried to tell myself it was all to stay productive to finish what was left of my degree, but part of me knew it was only so I could spend half of each day writing my thesis and the other half watching porn without having to worry about sleep. 

I went through an entire ball in a month, sleeping once every 4-5 days for about 12 hours between binges. I used an entire eighth in that month. I promised myself I'd get clean after I graduated, and so far I've stayed true to that promise. 

But 8 days after my last dose, I'm still exhausted all the time, guys. I'm so tired. I realize that my use was much more heavy this time around, and I should expect more intense detox symptoms. But when will it end? It would be so easy to find a new plug and use more; it's everywhere around here. But I know that's not the answer. If I don't stop now, I'll never stop, and I'll hate myself even more than I already do for being a disgusting piece of shit. 

I'm running out of days off of work. If I don't make money soon, I won't be able to cover my bills this month, and that's unacceptable. But I have no energy. My brain is still in a fog, and while I don't miss what happened to my body while I was using  (mild tremor, flushed oily skin, constipation, body pains and circulation problems from maintaining one position for hours on end, vasoconstriction, temperature regulation, issues, not to mention mild psychosis every few days), my mind keeps telling me that I could have the best of both worlds if I only took 10mg to take the edge off this malaise.

I’m not quite sure if it’s the correct subreddit to share this but I’m currently giving zero fucks about it anyway. Not because that I’m apathetic but more has to do with the brutal honesty moment to myself I’m in.
To sum up in a couple of commas; raised by a psychopathic dad until my mom finally decided to get the f out, changed at least 4 cities growing up one including a mild earthquake, still can’t shake the feeling that I’m not enough, can’t see any of the entitlements on my name -politics student, young unapologetic female etc.-, still unconsciously holding a grudge to my mom for her marriage because she brushes it under the rug like it never happened, repeating the same trauma bond cycle in my relationships -including the relationship I have with my own- and doing it with much awareness, can’t accept the public psychosis this world is going through, can’t feel belonged yet getting attached even the slightest appreciation I find which almost always turns into falls hopes. 
I’m unconsciously trying to build my own family in all my relationships, sacrificing too much for nothing. The last one was the most vulnerable I have found myself into... The day I found out to be pregnant from my now ex was the same day he found out his mom has terminal cancer. Gone through abortion alone but visited him in his hometown just that I felt he needed a hug with no money to even buy a ticket. 
Yeah uhm he was mad I asked for him to bring a mug to the motel I stayed when I was there, started playing the “cancer card” for every irrelevant scenario. 

The agony I’ve felt when I realized he wasn’t going to be my family too was so severe when I closed my eyes I remembered my dad. I remembered him saying me to do it right next time when I attempted suicide for the third time of that month. I remembered the ground shaking, I remembered to never have been enough. 
My vision was so psychotic that I saw only two options: numb yourself & forget it or find a rooftop to fall from because I was always so scared of the heights it would be a middle finger kind of end of this world.
It must be the survival instinct that I chose the first option, found an evil psych to prescribe me Xan and Ritalin. 

It has been almost 4 months now; I don’t know how many bottles of wine, how many cans of beer, how much gram of weed or how many films of cocktail Effexor, Xanax, Seroquel and Ritalin I have consumed.

The interesting part is since I have a solution ready in my hand for every possible situation -too much speed? Take a Xan. Too much vivid dreams take a Seroquel. Problem with Gaba receptors take an Effexor.

I never feel wasted. Did I forget what happened? Not inclusively, no. Am I fucking myself up? I don’t know school is fine, no family issues, just locked down in a bad economy. 

Still feeling alienated? Checked.
Where do I belong? Not checked, the worst uncertainty I can’t stand...

So yeah...
I don’t even know what I’m trying to say here.

I get fed up with him a lot because he runs out of money so quickly building his gun collection but he won't budget for groceries which means I often pay for a portion of his food bill so he doesn't starve. He also expects me to pay when we go out which is annoying.

He gets annoyed easily whether it's just me being a happy and goofy while I bake or other drivers on the road. It has become a real downer and I get self conscious about everything now since he always makes fun of me or gets annoyed by my idiosyncrasies. When he gets mad I feel like I'm walking on eggshells which is stupid because when I get mad I can have an adult conversation about it. But sometimes he gets mad when I tell him I'm mad and then he won't talk to me for the rest of the day.

We have bigger towns near us too (biggest town has 8,000 people) but the nearest sober house is an hour away and I work 10 hours a day so I would be commiting to 12 hour days which I know I can't sustain.

 It was my dream moving to this town and getting out of the city and while I still really love it I can't find any housing since it's so small.

I was doing well with my meth and adderall problem and was down to 15mg Adderall ir once daily in the morning and I’m taking zero meth.  I’ve only used meth one time in 55 days.
Yesterday was a trigger for my adderall abuse because I was in a social situation where I didn’t want to be a creepy, disconnected hermit amongst friends and family.  I preferred to be socially engaged and make a somewhat good impression.  I also had a lot of work to do helping to set up the party- chopping massive amounts of lettuce, tomatoes, and onions for the taco bar amongst other constant/ongoing  responsibilities/duties.
So here is the low-down and dirty.   I took 30mg in the morning instead of 15mg.  Then I proceeded to take one more 15mg later and then a 20mg in the later afternoon for a total of 65mg IR yesterday.  I still slept 8 hours last night somehow.
This morning I awoke and only took my Abilify and prozac- no adderall and I’m not hung- over.  I’m not craving yet either.
I think the next few days will be a challenge for me to function as well as I’d like to with only 15mg.

I take 3-4 times my prescribed amount (maximum recommended daily dose) and run out of my prescription really fast. Been through withdrawals a few times but always managed to get another script from my psychiatrist after a few days of hell. This time it isn't an option, I'm just going to have to go through it.

I'm basically looking for people that can help support me through this, especially the first week. I don't really have any friends or family that I can talk to.

And any advice would be so appreciated, I usually just lay down in bed thinking about suicide and feeling really lethargic. Any tips, however small, would be great.

I've wanted to quit for ages but I'm absolutely terrified of the withdrawals.

I took my last dose about 2 hours ago so I'm fine at the moment, but I know from tomorrow onwards it's going to be  a nightmare that just gets worse and worse.

Among other reasons, I found that when I was using I became incredibly hedonistic and pleasure seeking (going out and sleeping with multiple women a week, eating nothing but sweets, stealing from stores among other things impulsive (non too serious)

Ironically, I was a drug counselor at the time and  with no forethought, woke up one morning decided to quit cold turkey in October of 2020 while continuing to work. Fast forward to now. Most notably I’ve put on about 25 pounds and have a serious sugar addiction however mentally, something doesn’t feel quite right. Fortunately I did manage to keep within a “therapeutic dose” however my energy levels are typically very low and easily depleted, my social battery runs out extremely quickly, I don’t have that intense passion for things I love and overall just feel that life feels a little bland and everything seems boring. To anyone who’s experienced this. Is it normal to still feel this way 6 months in? I suppose I thought I’d be starting to feel a bit more umph by now  but I suppose that was wishful thinking.

One thing I’ve noticed as well is that my energy spikes/ dips throughout the day still sort of follow the same schedule as when I was using adderall. Has anyone else experienced this? 

I don’t really know why I’m sharing this. Suppose I’ve just been getting a bit disheartened. Before adderall, I was the life of the party, social, classically extroverted and now it feels like people exhaust me. 

Overall I do maintain relatively healthy habits . I exercise often and maintain my relationships / hobbies despite eating like complete shit. I’m pretty heavy into weed at the time being, considering stopping that. Not sure it’s helping

This post is most definitely scattered and has no order to it but it was just whats been on my mind.  I’m fairly confident I’ll never use again",5,0

I want to feel the progress and know that I'm getting closer and closer. 

But what is 100 percent back to normal? Like if you were on the track team in high school, got addicted during your first year of college, and are now 33 years old thinking that one day you're gonna wake up and feel like you did 10 years ago isn't gonna happen. And someone who used to be obese and uses exercise and a healthy diet as tools in their recovery might find that they feel better than they ever did before. There's other factors at play that influence our health and how we feel. The drugs we took just overpowered them. We felt good when we got high and bad when we came down.

We all wanna get to the finish line, be recovered and feel safe. I don't think there's a finish line any more. If you set a goal of losing 50 pounds and you make it, that's awesome. But your work isn't done. As soon as you stop what you did to get there you'll start gaining it back. 

I understand now why people in programs that have been sober for decades still consider themselves recovering addicts, rather than recovered addicts. 

My goal so far has been to feel as good as I would have if I never touched stimulants. And my expectations were that if I stop using for long enough I'll eventually get there - 10 months or 10 years who knows. 

My new goal is to learn how to live my best life without  stimulants. It's to learn how I react to stress, sleep, diet and everything else in my environment. It's to learn how to listen to my body, and understand what it's saying. It's to learn when I can trust myself and forsee myself losing control. It's to learn how to accept that sometimes I just won't feel good, and to accept that I'l never feel that intense overpowering manufactured rush of euphoria ever again. It's to know that it's worth it. 

I don't know what 100 percent recovered feels like, but I'm 100 percent sure being in any stage of recovery is better than being in this constant loop of euphoric despair.",14,0

People that turned to benzos just to chill out and deal with their anxiety find themselves living in rage being set off by the smallest thing.

People with social anxiety and bad self esteem that found out they could be the life of the party thanks to alcohol find themselves ruining relationships and humiliating themselves the more they drink. 

Me? I wanted to be more productive. I wanted self control. I wanted to have a plan in life and the focus to stay on it. I wanted to be calm and confident.

Tried it first time 2 years ago at age 39 and did it a few more times over 6 months. The next 6 months I started with pipe and ended on an 18 binge that nearly brought me to the crossroads. Had a moment of clarity and stopped. Completely cold turkey, no comfort meds, supplements or rehab. Just stopped and didn't look back. It was absolute hell for 2 weeks and another 2 before I felt normal.

Relapsed 21 days ago and went hardcore until yesterday I'd had enough. Throughout rest of bag and every piece of paraphernalia related. I remembered the misery I went through last year and I took better care of myself during this binge. Ate better, slept better with help of kpins and ghb in responsible doses. I'm about 30 hours since last meth use, ate great last night and slept 9 hours.

I'm sure I haven't hit the worst of the detox or withdrawal so I've prepared with a multitude of supplements and a few comfort meds.

Super B complex with vit C
Vitamin D3 and E
Zinc
Magnesium Citrate and oxide
Probiotic
Men's 1 a day multi vitamin

I ordered 180 capsules of Phenibut HCL 250mg capsules that will be here tomorrow (never used it, but well aware of it's own dangers) 

Ordered L Tyrosine and L Theanine which will be here Saturday.

On hand I have several strains of kratom, I'm a daily user but been on a break during binge so tolerance should be lower.

And I have 2 indica vape carts and 3mg of klonopin although I'm about to take 1mg with a few beers while I get on my riding lawnmower and jam with my headphones. It's very relaxing to me. I also walked a mile and a half yesterday and 2.5 miles today..

My question is, what should I expect in terms of recovery time? I expect a certain period of acute withdrawal —- lots of sleep, very low energy/motivation.

I thought I needed the poison to be productive but that shit did the opposite. I have adhd, it was much worse when I was abusing amphetamines. My short term memory and cognition were so fuckied 

I thought I destroyed my brain but it has recovered. I'm back to how I was before I started using. My moods are stable, no more panic attacks, anxiety is almost non-existent, depression vanished and most days I'm genuinely happy and  grateful to be alive and free.

It felt impossible to get a few days together at first but it's not. I never thought I 'd get clean but I did. 

I seldom have urges and when I do they're not severe but I make sure to work my program and the cravings disappear very quickly. 

Depression ends, withdrawals go away. If anybody's struggling I want you to know that I've been there.There is a way out of that hell. The path for me was rehab, 12 step meetings and total abstinence from all drugs&alcohol. I know others do it differently, that's just what works for me.

If you're struggling hang in there. If you're early get some sleep, relax, eat, maybe do some exercise when you feel up to it. That has helped me immensely, no depression when I quit this time because I got into the gym as soon as I got clean.I believe it helped my brain and body recover. 

Someone told me you don't have to fix everything that's wrong with your life when you first get clean. Take it easy on yourself. Getting clean is an immense undertaking. When you get there you'll see that staying clean is easier then getting clean.

Wouldn't call myself an addict, per say, but I've been in a relationship with a heavy meth addict for 3 years. For right now, I wanna focus on him. He's been using, as far as I've gathered, well over 15 years. In recent years, he was shooting it. It's been explicitly meth, but knowing the area it usually ends up cut with something.

What I want to know is, will his brain ever recover? Will his body recover from at least 4 years of banging? I shudder to think how many overdoses he actually has had over the years, and just been able to get up the next day like his normal speeding self. I want to help him get better, and I think we finally hit a breakthrough that'll keep him sober, but I want to be able to reassure him. I want to know if he'll ever get the motivation to take care of himself on his own, because I'm so afraid he's leaning on me like a crutch to stay sober.

We have two kids together and recently got married, so we have a lot we can't really afford to lose. He's got a therapist but he won't schedule appointments as often as he was recommended. I've brought up getting to an NA meeting, and he agrees, but never follows theough. I know that he WANTS to stay sober, I can see the light coming back in his eyes. He's only been a week sober now, but before that, he had 5 months sober before he relapsed again. I'm so confident that he CAN stay sober, but I'm afraid to fall in the same loop where he'll lie about the cravings, lie about where he's been, and before I know it I'm finding his new needle in the bathroom.

I love this human, because even spun out of his mind, he's been a great father and partner. I know that I'm stupid to have married him before he was really in recovery, but (mini backstory) I've been unknowingly around it for well over 6 years. My ex was a pretty heavy user, too, but hid it well. Said ex introduced me to pot, and while I wouldn't call it an addiction because it stimulates an appetite I haven't had since childhood, I haven't been able to go longer than a couple weeks without smoking.

I didn't know until I started dating my husband that my ex had spent 90% of our relationship on meth, and I had no idea. He was that good at manipulating me, and everyone he interacted with, so I never caught on. I lost friends, lost my job, dropped out of college and almost lost my relationship with my mom entirely because my ex had me in such a tight manipulation hold. It isn't even my husband just saying making up stories out of spite, other friends have come to me and corroborated the story.

They never warned me in school to what lengths a full blown addict will go to hide their addiction. Thanks to my husband, I have since learned.

With my husband, he truly cares about his family. Even when he tries to hide it, I catch on pretty quick when he's using. He'll try to avoid us, avoid me. Probably to hide his shame, which has been the major setback. I think he's so guilt ridden that he doesn't think he can be a normal human without meth. He has good days and bad days, works an overnight position I've been trying to talk him into moving to days for 2 years now (his longest stay at a single job for the last 10 years or so?). I had an overnight job last year, but mid-year, post-pandemic I figured out his needle use, and that one of my coworkers was actually his dealer. So, quit to be a stay at home mom again. He got sober for 5 months, relapsed, sober again for 4 months, relapsed, sober a few weeks, we got married and he relapsed. I know it would help him immensely for me to get back out into the workforce world, be a productive member of society again. I'm just so worried that he'll use my absence as an excuse to use more, like last year.

Anyway, sorry this is so long, just kinda venting, wondering if any of y'all got some advice, experiences that might be helpful. Try to keep it civil, please, I know I'm dumb but I'm trying my best with what I got. No one is perfect.",6,1

I can really get stuff done without the drugs. I think that’s something you have to learn through time in recovery. The first few months are gonna be actually brain and body recovery. Emotional recovery is extremely important here too, knowledge is extremely essential for getting through life clean. This means having a therapist, going to in/outpatient drug/alcohol rehab. Both are nice.

Be patient my friends, and stay strong. With time, the pain WILL ease.",32,0

First post in this community, but have been lurking for a lil while.   I need to get involved, trying to lose this addiction and help people in the process.  Much love :)

I am a total stimmy head... I hate opiates, lazy ass silly pillies, Fuck that shit.  Used adderall and Vyv in high school and college... and then it got worse....... you already know.   Pretty much only a weekend user and have only done M maybe 50-70 times.   Done Coco a fair share of times too.   I have never been truly hooked on these drugs tho.... and most of the time give myself days/weeks recovery time between usages.   TBH, It would be really dope to use Adderall a couple times a year.... but if it keeps being an issue of moderation I will just cut it out of my life. 

Also, I am trying to cut out coffee and caffeine.  I have reduced nicotine from smoking and vaping to just dipping (which is my least favorite) (I know dip has high nic don't lecture me).  I am also aiming to try to only smoke weed after 7PM.  That patience all day vibe..... night time toke is always the best dude. Real shit. 

Anyway I am a science enthusiast, and I truly believe we have the ability to get higher than any drug just by our own anatomy and physiology.  I urge you to not to do Stimulants today! Save your dopamine for an activity that counts! One that produces a product! Go create something instead of getting high! or maybe just change over the laundry from the washer to the dryer, or water that one wilting plant in your living room.. there is dopamine to be gained on every positive motivational activity that benefits your life. 

I plan on counting this as day 1 off meth, coke, and any prescription form of amphetamines. Lehgo squad. 

Please drop a comment on any part of this post that interested you.   :)  I will be frequenting this subreddit daily/weekly.

Almost May the Fourth be with you, Jedi.

I figured it was a shame not to post it on the sub, too, for the possible benefit of you guys; or at the very least entertainment.

TLDR; I desided to take my meds as prescribed in gradually escalating doses under strict supervision of my parents who will make sure to cut my supply if things go south.

DISCLAIMER: Please do not be led astray by my personal story. If you possibly can be completely sober, then by all means DO! Sober = son of a bitch everything’s real. Real can suck. But real can also be glorious. In my instant, real happens to be partially artificial for the time being. The following is the story of a man who’s life showed no improvement after four months of abstinance and my approach might safe my life for honestly, I would rather not be than exist in an ever-lasting misery of fatigue and brain fog with no end in sight. My prayers go to all of you brave allies who have united your forces in the war against stimulants. May your life be blessed beyond measure and may your life be sustained in vitality and joy by the power of your soul and by the support of your God, if applicable, and the support of your loved once who are the reasons you decide to keep on crawling the path away from the cravings that want to see you pine away and leave your loved once depressed. Maybe they would also become drug addicts if you did not succeed or maybe they would just press the kill switch. Life is full of marvels in sobriety. And I’m sorry if my choice is discouraging. Stay strong! My heart is with all of you. 

Hey buddy, thanks a lot for your message. I’ll be totally honest and say that I’m on Vyvanse as I’m writing this (that’s the reason I can even respond to you in the first place) – but it’s not as bad as it sounds. You see, I found a solution. Maybe it can work for you too. I hope so. Because I don’t want to see the stims slowly, or rather quickly, destroy you. I got sober on January 4. Since then, my life has been on a halt. If my life were a business, it would have fallen apart to complete ashes, leaving me bankrupt. I literally could merely watch shows and movies in bed for four months. Couldn’t even go to the store or the gym or even if I barely managed it, it was an unpleasant and very strenuous experience. My parents both have CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome). I suspect I have it too. My recovery was way to slow. As I live in Iceland (were the only good months are May-August) I couldn’t bear being a bedridden wreck of a man for the summer. So here’s the solution I came up with. I managed to get my 1x bottle of 30x70 mg Vyvanse + 1x bottle of 30x50 mg Vyvanse + one bottle of 150x0,5 mg Klonopin from another doctor as I kind of fucked up be being sober for four months and raised some suspicion. Luckily, I still managed to renew the priscriptions. I told my parents with which I live and they were furious/heartbroken for obvious reasons.

But my dear Dad devised a great plan. He ordered my to go buy a $200 safe and said they would condone my experiment (which is to take the meds exactly as prescribed and never more). But don’t start with 120 mg V a day right away though. Instead, work my way up like folks with ADHD are meant to do. My parents dispense me 1x 50 mg V + 2x 0,5 Klonopin every night and I take the meds downstairs to my bedroom, ready to be taken immediately upon awakening in the morning. After about a week, they will up the dose to 70 mg daily. Then, perhaps after two or three weeks to 100 mg daily (2x 50 mg) and finally, after maybe a month or more, to my legally prescribed daily dose of 120 mg which is a high dose; equivalent of approx. 40 mg of Adderall. It is of paramount importance the dose be gradually increased. Were I to start with 120 mg right away after my miserable four-month “tolerance break” I would experience the good’ol high too intensely – which is the root of the problem. This is day four of the treatment/experiment. So far so good. Yes, it does suck to merely be able to enjoy a single 50 mg pill of speed; but everything is better than the bed from which I have now risen. My life has resumed. For that I’m eternally greatful.

As for the benzos, I actually do have legitimate anxiety and OCD that bothers me in day-to-day life. But speed is my main problem. I only abuse Klonopin when I also abuse speed. The two go hand-in-hand like rum and coke (the drink coke that is haha). There is a fail-safe to this system of ours; if I as much as once attempt to break into the safe in the middle of the night with an angle grinder or an axe or whatnot – which thing I would be quite likely to attempt when very high on stims – the authority (my parents) will bin my pills and more than that; they will call the medial authority figures and tell them the whole truth of me being a hopeless drug addict. That would make it impossible to get the good stuff legally from a pharmacy ever again. Knowing this, I must behave and I do. Because if I fuck up, I will be dooming myself to a lifetime of misery. I would probably actually rather die than not being able to take these drugs in the prescribed doses; they enable me to live and, more importantly, be successful career-wise. If I go on the black market to try to score more than I’m given daily, the same applys. Besides, I would have to file for bankruptcy if I did that. Well, that must be all for now.

Better control those speed writing impulses. Good luck to you and be careful. Know that YOU cannot handle them stims yourself. It’s impossible. We’re addicts after all. But maybe we aren’t quite hopeless. Yesterday, I wanted to pop another V after the main effects wore off but I couldn’t and just had to grit through the cravings. Goodness, am I glad I did because I could actually sleep last night and today is another glorious day. Also, it sucks to have to check your pulse every hour to determine who likely you are to have a heart attack and then gauge how many more benzos you have to pop; only to pop even more Vyvanse a couple hours later and thus repeat the downward spiral of addiction bound for death. As for the meth, I will never touch that again because although I did feel like the supreme being of the universe for a day, I suffered from the worst episode of depression of my life for five hours straight on the comedown. The kind of depression that makes you actually start plotting ways in your mind to get a gun, ponder where to hide your body, desite a date, brainstorm what exactly to write in your suiced note and whom to address in it. Imagine, enduring that for hours on end. This is what happens when you do meth. 

Anyway, good luck to you and don’t die. Btw, you are right. Most Celebrites do struggle with substance abuse. Many of my fans kind of suspected it and thought it was coke. If they only knew how much worse it was… I’m a social media influencer and I was always uploading content with huge pupils haha. Not anymore. Sorry (or not sorry) for the block of text. Now I’m going to enjoy the rest of today’s Vyvanse. Gotta laugh at how those peculiar little bastards of pills trick you into writing novels as forum messages lol. This is not the first time. Hopefully, I helped you though and please tread carefully on satant’s territory or better yet avoid it at all or do a responsible compromise like me. Have a great day!

Sincerely (but with minimal ‘sin’), GoldenTrinity ❤️🙏🏻

Things were a little dicey for the first 4 months or so. After that I became more functional. I am now doing waaay better now. I have to use my brain for my job in a way that also requires public speaking. I have made some important cognitive leaps these past few months. I can read and comprehend dense texts better than when I was on addy. I still need to work on my umms and uhhs when speaking. I passed a really important work review with flying colors. I can write well again, my partner says my writing is better now than before. I celebrate small victories and do not let the brain and cognitive function studies get me down. 

I recently started the Mr Happy Stack. I think it is helping me along with 8 hours of sleep daily. I gained 30lbs but have now lost 10. I feel like I am finally able to control myself around food. Grateful I have stopped gaining for sure. Still have work to do.

I have been cutting down on caffeine these past two weeks. This has been hard because I could drink a 6 shot iced latte and then drink half of a second. The caffeine withdrawals have been intense—giving me acute withdrawal flashbacks from addy. I am now down to 2.5 cups of pour over coffee @ 1/3 decaf at home, no coffee shop drinks allowed. I am pouring out 1/4 of a cup every 2-3 days. This is also helping my pants situation and wallet. I can’t regret those lattes that got me out of the house during those hard pandemic days, though.

Working on bringing meditation back and rollerskating. I still have blah depression days but I push through. Hang in there friends! Please share your progress. Hearing from you really keeps me going. ❤️",49,1

I consider my friend an “addict” because he binges 70+ mg of Adderall every weekend, pulling an all nighter. And when he uses he plays guitar, gambles, and watches porn. He’ll then use a bit of it early in the week just to stave off withdrawal. 

I’ve quit Adderall for months at a time, but I always come back because my work suffers too much. 

Is addiction dose dependent? If you consider yourself an amphetamine addict, how much and often did you use?
