My CT was not a choice, as I had a 5 day, 4 night stay in the psych ward due to auditory and visual hallucinations that led me to a psychotic break. The psychiatrists said that 4% of people experience them while using kratom. Lucky me?

The pain and fatigue seemed unbearable, until I happened to read a passage in a book detailing the foundations of buddhism. I'm a proud Jew, but it was so appropriate. Basically, all suffering comes from craving - craving more pleasure or craving an ending to pain. Craving is the source of all suffering. When you realize that your craving brings you no pleasure, it's easy to see it for what it is. Your body does not require it to live. Your body does not need it. You crave only to end your own suffering, but the suffering is the craving.

I have found that my experience of pain is actually like the pins and needles from a limb that's fallen asleep. My WHOLE BODY has not truly been experiencing itself in three years! So EVERYTHING feels like pain at first - but then you actually get to start feeling PLEASURE again! It's like my life is a shiatsu massage - it feels way too deep and intense, but it's actually waking all of my muscles up, and bringing me back to life again. Like a long yoga pose - my body shakes and strains, but that is my body working itself back into gear after being asleep for so long. 

I know why today was so much better! I kept a jump rope at the back door. Every time I felt tired, weak, fatigued, or anxious, I went and tried to jump as much as I could in 5 minutes. Better than any pain pill. I felt stronger and in control. It felt good to get my heart pumping in my chest. I did just 3 sets through the day, like 5 minutes each. And it helped SO MUCH. My body aches today are 90% less than in previous days. My therapist recommended cardio, and I fucking hate running and I'm not going to a gym - but I got a rope by the door! I would highly recommend even a few minutes of something that will pump your blood back through you. I also had to stop taking Vistaril because it was increasing my fatigue so much. Who knew 5 minutes with a jump rope would be better than meds?

I may be on a pink cloud today, but the buddhist perspective and the jump rope helped get me here, so I had to share those two things with y'all. 

Keep fighting the good fight. It doesn't feel like strength, but by God you are strong as fuck to get through this.",29,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.36752218}"

The first two days I had the worst anxiety I've ever had (minus when I quit alcohol several years ago) but for the most part, it was mostly mild/moderate leg pain, runny nose, and little sleep.  My Dr did prescribe 50mg of vistaril which helped as much as it could.  Been going on at least two long walks a day but I could barely make it through one today.  And my stomach is an absolute mess.  I'll take this over the awful constipation I had when using kratom.  Im really glad that I've been able to make it 6 days.  I tried to taper but trying to wake up in the morning was hell. 

So i have to say that in the end, it's not as bad as I thought it would be (like I said earlier alcohol withdrawal was worse for me) but I'm also surprised by how long it takes to bounce back.

TL:DR see bottom for question if you wish

Hello all, been reading quittingkratom posts for awhile, finally decided to join. I've been eating the green shit for 14 months now, started out taking 4-5g once a day at the end of the day to quit drinking and it worked like a charm, but after awhile RLS kicked in and I needed more to sleep. I believe I had RLS underlying before though, but that's neither here nor there. Everything went down hill from there, although slowly at first, and at one point I did try to taper, got down to like 8g a day but didn't have good supportive measures to help continue (exercise, projects, etc). So, I basically jumped from one drug to another, and after 7 months in taking it, I was up to 30gpd, sometimes 35 grams a day. Holidays with the stress of in laws staying an entire month and I caved a few times above 35g too. 10 months in, and I ran into a host of problems, the worst of which was the inability to take deep breaths, though I desperately needed them. I went through 2 bouts of this, one for almost a month and another for a few weeks, and I can tell you that it was the most horrifying experience ever. I was a wreck. Imagine you NEED a deep breath so bad, but you can never, ever get one, and failing to get that deep breath HUNDREDS of times a day. I was non functioning and if it wasn't for my wife I would have been fucked. My acupuncturist said it was extreme kidney yang deficiency, along with liver yin deficiency. This lead to what in chinese medicine is called ""Chi Wild"" or in other words, the seperation of Yin and Yang. She informed me that it was the high kratom usage that was causing it, and I know enough about my body and chinese medicine to know that she was right. So I started an aggressive taper, and within a week I brought it down from 25-30gpd I think, to about 10, and the combination of needing the kratom to sleep and not feel insane, but also feel it deplete my kidneys and weaken my liver in the same hand was not fun. 

Well, I've been struggling at 10gpd for a while, and just in the past week have I discovered that as long as I don't take any at all during the day, and just take some at night, it makes life and tapering easier, so now I am officially at 6.2gpd, and I really want to get off this fucking shit. MY QUESTION IS THIS: At this point, I was considering reducing by .4gpd, with my doses currently being 4.1g just before sleeping, and another 2.1g around 3-5am when I wake up with RLS. That would make my next day's dose 3.9+1.9g. Is this too slow? Too fast? Just want some opinions here. I don't want to drag this out but multiple times I have tried to shave off too much and I wake up at 5am unable to sleep after those two doses, then I take 1g for a third, and when I finish sleeping I discover that that 1g I took to extend sleep HAS DESTROYED ME, bringing back those ""Chi Wild"" symptoms a bit, which I want to NEVER experience again. Your thoughts, everyone? Sorry for the long post",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7684051}"

Moved 1200 miles out of state, went from H to poppy seeds, to kratom, which become a huge 60gpd or more problem. But I went cold turkey after a move to a new apartment, and was clean for a few months. 

That was, until I smashed my finger at work in a van's sliding door. I had a panic attack for the first time in my life, drove myself to the ER as my hands curled up into claws from apparently breathing too fast. I left the ER with 60 more packages to deliver (amazon courier). It was then that I relapsed. For much, much longer this time, but at a much lower dose. Just enough to keep the pain away. But after a few months the pain from my finger was gone, but I was addicted to not feeling pain at all while working. 

So I do this for a while, ignoring phone calls, family, friends. My grandmother tries to call but I only text.  She's in the hospital, but she'll be okay I think to myself. I can't talk to her in this agitated state. Ill contact her when I get better..

I finally get done with the last week of taper, on my second day sober when my mom calls me.. My grandmother had passed. I was beyond devastated. I hadn't talked to or seen her since I'd moved away. The person that drove me to the hospital when I OD'd. The person that bought me a car, that believed in me when no one else would when I was a junkie, without whom I'd be dead or homeless..

I flew down, sober, and cried the entire time. Saw my grandmother's bloated corpse in the casket. It looked nothing like her, except her hands. When I flew back home,  my sister and law and her son were going to be staying with us for a week, something that had been planned well before my grandmother passing.

So I relapsed. I couldn't take it, I couldn't function, I shouldve asked off of work but I didn't. Because I have to make money. So I dose for a week, and stop for a few days. and dose for a week, then stop. Except, a month later, last week, I find out our company is shutting it's doors, I'm laid off with a weeks worth of notice. I bought kratom for that last week.

Today is my first sober day again, used my last dose yesterday. I'm anxious, my heart is racing, I'm all sweaty, I have to find a job, I want to go grab a bag and just get down to the job search but it all seems so futile. Fuck.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5485583}"

Anyway, last 3/4 days has been around 3 gpd, taking less than a level teaspoon (about 3/4) in the morning and once again before bed.

Last night rls was really starting to bother me. Couldn't fall asleep, rls is always something that drives me crazy. It's probably the most dreaded thing for me. Anyway, I took an additional small dose and finally was able to sleep...and sleep, and sleep. I finally got out of bed about an hour ago. Felt miserable. Mornings are usually rough for me. Haven't dosed yet, had my keto coffee, uldn, and BSO. I'm feeling a lot better. Enough to do some cardio, without dosing.

My question is should I continue to push this taper lower or should I level off for a few days? At times, all things considered, I feel fucking amazing. I have little motivation, other than doing cardio on my elliptical machine, I've done nothing else. Should I wait to suffer some before dosing again? Especially since I took a small extra dose due to rls? Right now I know I can wait. Not sure if I will make it to the evening, but it's definitely a good possibility.

But then I was weak, during quarantine I thought I could just have a little bit because I was stuck inside bored and of course that snowballed me back into a full blown habit of 30-50 gpd for the last 3 months. I got away from everything that made the quit possible, I stopped exercising, stopped eating right, I stopped meditating, started smoking again, stopped  all of it and this is the result. If you think youre in the clear, youre not, I thought I could just use a little bit and be done, but nope it just doesnt work that way. You have to fight and keep fighting. So here I am back at day 3 CT with the same WD issues as before, the one good thing is I know how good I felt after getting off of kratom for a while so thats whats keeping me positive.

I remember waking up last Monday with a feeling of dread like I’m standing at the emotional gallows all by myself waiting for my hanging. So dramatic right? Well that feeling got me pissed. Not at myself this time. At Kratom. I hate it, and if it’s what I need to live then I’m all good on this life. I have to look at it as life or death because it is. I was dying a slow spiritual death that I know will eventually take me to my grave. 

You know the routine, mild buzz and insert endless side effects here. 

So this is what I did with supplements, full disclosure:

Day 1: I bought some CBD gummies (never had any before) and I felt a mild subsiding of my anxiety then only when I took a deep breath to feel if it was still there. I’ll take it. I popped a Benadryl that night and went to bed.

Day 2: cbd gummy in the morning, then I hunted for Black Seed Oil, found it at GNC popped 2 500mg(bc that’s what the bottle said) and started to feel the restlessness go away an hour later. 

(So disclaimer) I asked my mom for xanex and she took mercy on me w 4 .25 mg pills. Now I have had many drug problems in my life and I want to be super careful here. Xanex will ruin your life period. Me personally have never had a problem w them for some odd reason, everyone’s chemistry is different. I only took them at bed time never as an “as needed” bc then I’m just doing the same shit I did w the Kratom to escape. I know sleep is the key factor to fighting this detox demon bc I am a human and if we don’t sleep we get crazy, drugs or no drugs. And the last thing I need is a crazy me with car keys and my wallet going to the head shop. So I slept 6 hours.

Day 3: woke up after 6 hours of sleep w RLS or as I like to say I was woken by my “leg alarm clock” I ate a CBD gummy (the exact amount recommended for a beginner) and 1 500mg BSO pill (cold pressed) I only took one bc that’s what you guys said is all I need. Mid day the same as well as before bed with a .25 xanex.

I’m not trying to escape the pain fully, I’m just trying to ease myself a bit so I can slowly (very slowly at times) do some things to get me back into life. 
From what I understand this is a heavy mental spiritual game, the physical will go away shortly. Thank god for the summer, I spent almost every hour outside bc the ac was too cold for me. Being outside and walking or just sitting reading this thread or listening to music made me feel better. I spent the morning on the beach staring at the water as well.

Day 4: same thing exactly 6 hours of sleep and starting to feel better. I’m still in this shit tho don’t get me wrong the leg alarm clock still woke me up. I kept the same regiment as day 3 but I added some emergen-C to the situation around noon and that helped. Outside most of the day walking and sitting depending on the waves of fatigue. 

Day 5: still sticking to not taking too much of everything or only as directed. One .25 of the xanex knocked me tf out and I was grateful, 7 hours but still up at the butt crack of dawn. I had the dreadful awning of work hanging over my head, so I made sure to obsess over that like I was gonna die. Well I didn’t and I was tired but it was doable. The truth is I was feeling better but my mind wants me to not see that. As an addict I’m obsessed w how I feel and minor discomfort and I gotta “fix it.”  Fuk that, i must push through. Got home BSO, CBD, and a half of a .25 xanny.

Day 6: 5 hours of sleep, that’s life I guess. Still sticking to the same thing, I will not over medicate and no matter how bad the anxiety can be I will not take the xanex. I have to work on my feet all night and it’s Saturday night. So it’s busy, I was sooo tired. I welcomed the time not staring at the clock though and obsessing over how my legs felt. And the best thing is I didn’t die, or lose my job like my brain was telling me. I know from experience that when I’m in detox mode, my brain cannot be trusted. I made a decision and that’s what we are doing brain. Home CBD, BSO, half of .25 xanex.

Day 7: I’m alive after 5 hours of sleep. I woke up went to the beach for my daily routine. I came home and did a bunch of laundry at the laundry mat. Same boring (working) thing CBD, BSO, and Emergen-C. But I took it at noon. I wanted to hold out. I don’t want the chains of needing anything eventually. I came back home after laundry and my girl wanted me to do somethings I felt like I was wearing a suit of armor, I have to understand this is life. It’s not Kratom. I’m tired and that’s okay, I don’t need to slug down green shit to make the natural feeling of exhaustion go away.
This day no mid-day supplements except for some green tea, which gave me a push. And at night CBD, BSO, and 10mgs of melatonin.

Today I woke up on day 8 after 8 hours of sleep and I’m a little tired, but I’m on fucking dayyy eighttt!
I’m excited bc I wanted to be here so bad when I was choking down god knows what of green junk to not feel shitty at the end. I am living proof that a terrible addict at one time or another (or another lol) can make it to day eight. 
I will say that this is only my experience, but an experience nonetheless. And I hope for another day sober. I am just trying to get to day 9. Send up a prayer for me if you would. Have a great day the best you can no matter what day you’re on. Peace and love fam.",22,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.64787287}"

2020-06-29 04:31:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/hhw5kx/unexplained_side_effects_of_kratom/,Unexplained side effects of kratom.,"I am getting off kratom (this coming day is my fourth day off of it) mainly due to a number of unusual side effects as well as the more well known ones (like low sex drive).  I have been on and off kratom enough times to know that these side effects are definitely a side effect of the kratom. I was wondering if any of you had  also had anything odd and if so is that is why you want to quit?

Here are some side effects that don't seem to well explained by kratom's known effect on opioid receptors:

1. I became underweight out of nowhere. I never tried to not eat in order to take a dose (did not even know that was a thing until coming here) but somehow I lost a lot of muscle and weight in a matter of months. Regained quickly each time after quitting.   Eating more was not really sufficient to restore the weight until I quit kratom. Where were the calories going?
2. Feeling like my body is somehow malnourished or mildly hypoglycemic--like I have not ate food in hours. Yet when I eat or drink a soda it does not go away.  Perhaps this relates to 1?
3. Strange mental effects (weird dizziness, head in vice feeling, eye wobbles, some sort of difficulty focusing my eyes, couldn't think ) . Oh and often a significant increase in anxiety and jitteriness - almost makes you feel restless.

My wife was super supportive and we went to the ER to treat the panic attack and hopefully get placed in detox, 6 hours in and I was having full body muscle spasms so bad that the doctor thought I was having a seizure. They refused to treat me until I spoke with a social worker. Luckily she came and had a detox bed available that night. The gave me some Ativan and most the spasms subsided. 5 days in detox being heavily sedated on benzodiazepines and now I’m out back in recovery completely clean and sober. They practically demanded I be on suboxone but I chose to go without for what I think are obvious reasons. Anyone have any tips for the next 30 or 60 days on any post acute withdrawals they suffered and and supplements or activities that helped them.

I remember it being just a really difficult first month to get through.  Especially the first 4-5 days.  Mostly just mental suffering.  I would feel numb, depressed, and even hopeless at times.  Zero joy or motivation.  It does get better, but it just takes a lot longer than a typical opiate withdrawal (which Ive had plenty of).  

So after being clean for a good 4 months, life got so much better but then I hit a stressful spot.  I felt like the best and only way to get through this rough patch was to get back on Kratom temporarily until I could take care of the problems I was facing.  Yes, the Kratom helped in the short term, but was just right back full blown into it.  It does way more damage in the long run.  For me, I always felt like I needed a crutch  or 'buzz' to get through tough times in life.  I know I need to change this paradigm and thinking pattern for coping with life's struggles.  Life's struggles are never going away.

This time I am doing the CT a little differently.  I have plenty of helper meds like benzos, GABA, and ambien this time. Sleep is super important, even if it is just like a few hours a night.  I also bought a case of Ensure (the nutritional drink) for the calories and vitamins my mind and body will need for recharging purposes.  I also plan on taking long walks each day.  At least 1-3 miles.  Exercise is a huge part of recovery.  Or I might just dope myself through the next few days to just get over the hump?  Im not sure how this will play out, but if it works better or at least makes the WD easier than my last one where I used nothing, I will post again in a few days for informative purposes.

  There's been many post about it here, albeit older ones, and I'm hoping to find anymore folks that are experiencing it now, or more importantly, those that have in the past.

  I'm 74 hrs in the kick, not my first, and even though I have no illusions that the ringing will immediately go away, I'm curious about others with the same issue. There's too little medically known about this to give me insight or comfort. 

  I'm not going to go into my first rig-ma-role with this shit, only to say that in true form of an addict, the second time around I had 'figured it out.' 
  I kept the doses low, around 4.5 grams a day. The small sounds came back, but nothing a fan at night couldn't deal with. My temper stayed in check, and even though I knew I had lost certain parts of my personality, others hadn't seemed to have noticed, my appetite hadn't changed, and my drinking slowed down. This maintained for about a year.

  Then 2020 came. I feel I don't really need to say much more than that.

  My doses shot through the roof. 10-15gr a day from February. Along with periotic bouts of heavy drinking two to three times a month. Now I have a cracked cochlear that left me deaf in one ear that happened in my 20s (I'm 42 now) so I've always had to deal with a certain amount of tinnitus since, but it never really bothered me. About a month ago I noticed the ringing  spread deep into my good ear and the ringing in my dead ear has gotten louder. And it's just gotten worse. I had to hold off quitting for a week to function with family issues and three days ago I dumped everything. 

  I don't know how to tag folks here yet and in my current state I have no interest in learning. Plus I took apart the kitchen sink needing to to move and function in any capacity last night.

OMG, I am really annoyed that this is taking so long to get off this drug!!!  EVERY SINGLE NIGHT I wake up in a pool of sweat somewhere between 1230 - 400 am because my body is back in withdrawal. I get up, drink my kratom, get some coffee, play on the internet, and go back to sleep.  I must say I cannot wait to sleep a full 8 hours peacefully when this is all said and done!!  Plus, the on and off hot/cold sweating during my workouts are driving me nuts.  It's so bizarre to have a withdrawal sensation like this lasting forever!!  I know I sound like I'm whining, but I'm just shocked that something we can buy legally is this much of a poison to our system.

Anyhow, I am VERY PROUD of my progress and I am getting so close to being done.  I am kinda freaked out because I was asked to do a podcast regarding my sobriety when I got a year sober.  The girl that asked me just touched base with me again and my we are going to do it next Tuesday evening.  My story will be on this site called, ""Beginner Triathlete.""  I am a little freaked out, but I think more excited than anything.  I don't know about you guys, but I am a big fan of spirit guides/guardian angels.  I believe they are always trying to give us signs and help guide us through life.  So the craziest thing happened today.  I was debating on whether or not I was going to use an alias to do the podcast or just go live with it as myself.  I was really unsure, but I kept having this tugging sensation that said ""just be honest. Tell everyone about kratom too.  Tell them you are almost done with it. It's your story. Don't lie.""  So then out of nowhere I get my morning text from this guy Ralphie I randomly met at an AA meeting in the Outerbanks.  He's from NY, but I loved this man so much when I met him we exchanged numbers so he could put me on his daily chain of morning inspirational messages.  Well, today his message was: "" 

Secrets and Stories about who We were keep Us stuck in the past. 

Truth and Honesty about who We are set Us free, and keep Us free.

So I was like, damn, there it is.  Just do it.  And the weirdest thing happened. As I visualized me telling all my dirt on this podcast for the entire world to hear my life story, I felt it all lift off my chest and I suddenly felt free.  At this point in my life I simply cannot go back down the path of addiction again.  I almost died in a horrific car accident the last time I drank a year ago.  I am so determined to make sure I never relapse again that this feels like the right thing to do.  If I tell the world my secrets then I'll be too afraid to ever pick up again.  So I'm just gonna suck it up, bear it all to the world, and pray it doesn't back fire on me.  

Keep on trucking my friends!!   We are on the road to victory!

One Love

I've been in this cycle for a while now. Use plain leaf kratom for like two weeks straight, quit, feel normal, cravings kick in a few days after withdrawal symptoms cease, I convince myself ""yeah I can use one time and be fine"", pick up an extract to 'really feel it', and then again the next day, and then stop because I know withdrawal symptoms will come back if i keep doing this, for two or three days, and then more extract, until i start having mild symptoms 24-48 hours after last dose, and then I convince myself that I need plain leaf to get through work, repeat indefinitely. It's been going like this for 5 or 6 months now. The withdrawal is almost always negligible and i'm not too worried about it because i'm never redosing repeatedly in the same day unless it's extremely low quantities of plain leaf.   


The things I am worried about, is this eventually progressing into fully fledged addiction again. The first, and only time so far, I quit a high dosage of kratom (70-80gpd) I was sick for over a month, and nearly lost my job. Also organ problems popped up and I was in and out of the hospital. I don't want that to happen again, and I know if I stay on this route it will.   


But it's like the me post-withdrawal is a different me from the me writing this. I'm familiar with this concept. I went through it with opiates in the past. But i'll be through the withdrawal, coming home from work, and straight up just convince myself it'll be fine. Just one time, this time, to unwind. And then I use every other day for a week or two until I'm freaking out again. This stress is causing me to gain weight. To have poor work performance. My relationship is suffering because when i'm high, i don't want sex, and when i'm not, the mild withdrawal makes me too self conscious to even think about it. My girlfriend understands but I can tell it's wearing on her. I legitimately feel like I have very little control over my choices in regard to this plant. In a way, quitting high doses of it was easier. I felt physically like I was in hell, and my health was in jeopardy, and so I was able to make up my mind instantly. But now, when i'm not on it, it's so easy to convince myself to go get some. I'm considering cutting my debit cards in half so I just can't buy any.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.71021193}"
2020-06-28 11:05:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/hhfwq7/rapid_taper/,Rapid taper...,"Hello world. I'll give a somewhat brief history. 44 old year male, been using drugs since 21. Never had a problem with anything until opiates about 10 years ago. Been free from oxy since October, and was free from April to October of 2019, but was on low dose subs. Had a terrible experience with subs in the past, abused the hell out of them and went through the worst wd and paws for over 4 months. Learned that lesson, well sort of.

Stayed clean for approximately 6 months after that sub experience, however found a half a strip in my car and took it. Was flying around at work, and loved it. Found a connect for oxy in my new home state and that was it. Took oxy for 5/6 years, with some kratom breaks in between, but very few. Anyway, prior to April of last year I was making a ton of money and my oxy addiction was beyond ridiculous. I was averaging 50 30's per day, and a couple of times I did significantly more than that. Towards the end of this monumental run, I was very desperate to stop. I knew I was going to die. So...my lizard brain decided to start doing cocaine to stop doing so many pills. I'd start my day with 10 oxies, do cocaine at work all day. We all know how that worked. It didn't. Was doing 2 8 balls a day at work, which stopped my oxy until the evening. Then I'd do another 30-40 pills coming down before I'd left for work, literally within 2 hours. Xannies mixed in occasionally as well. It's a miracle I'm still alive.

I stopped taking my low dose sub, was taking about 1/4mg daily, but couldn't jump off completely. Started with kratom. I'm now about 8 months into a serious kratom addiction. I still feel/felt amazing on kratom. I just see where this is leading. I started around 20 gpd, but over the last few months it's also increased significantly to on average, 100 gpd.

Anyway, 2 Saturdays ago, my girl was going out of town, alone by myself and knew this was the time to try and quit. I'd normally start my day with 3 heaping teaspoons, and within the hour take an additional teaspoon to start my day. Anyway, my rapid taper began with my taking only 4-5 level teaspoons per day since then. The last 3 days I've tapered even further. I even managed to go 27 hours without any 2 days ago.

Wisely, I started working out again in early May. During the taper, that has stopped, until ironically 2 days ago. Anyway, I've done some light cardio for the last two days. Have only had one sleepless night so far, but pretty terrible sleep overall since tapering. Anyway, wifey doesn't come home for another 9 days, so still have time to get my shit together. She doesn't know about my problems. Not sure where to go from here.

I did take less than a teaspoon this morning and last night before bed for sleep. I feel better for the most part these last few days than I had during my earlier taper.

Supplements are cbd gummies for sleep, black seed oil multiple times per day, uldn (ultra low dose naltrexone),  l-theanine, and magnesium.

I've only had one night of rls, which was starting last night, which was why i took the small dose last night.

Definitely noticed more sides over the last few days, but again also feel better, which is odd. Sneezing, yawning, rls didn't happen at all until now, along with stomach issues.

One weird thing I've experienced though, doing cardio at a very light rate compared to normal, my chest hurts as I start breathing heavy. I'm basically doing my warm up speed for the entire workout due to energy issues. I'm not pushing, just trying to get the blood flowing again. 

I also wear a Garmin fitness watch, one of its features is stress levels, which have obviously been through the roof during the taper. Even just laying around all day, I have higher stress than when I was working out multiple times and hours per day recently and staying really active. I guess I see why clonidine and the likes really help.

Guess that wasn't that brief. Sorry. Again, just feel I'm at a cross roads. I have to clean our house, which is currently a disaster. No energy to do that. Food shop, might just order delivery. Just wanted to share as well, especially since I'm so close to the goal.",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4543179}"

I'll try to keep the backstory short and to the point.  I've always had an addictive personality, be it drugs, hobbies, or whatever.  Including marijuana, I've used substances for about 1/2 of my life (I'm 34).  I've done pretty much everything except needles.  I have had some bouts of being sober amongst those years, and of course, have felt best during those times... but then I get bored/curious/can't sleep/etc.   I started using Kratom about 3 years ago.  Never anything comparatively crazy.  Took about 10 GPD for a year, quit CT for 6 months.  Then 10 GPD for a year and tapered until my son was born.  The idea was ""I'll be sober his whole life.""  Well, for all of you who know what it's like when a baby is born, you basically don't sleep for 3-6 months, plus I work 12-14 hours a day, so that was a horrible time to quit for me.   I only lasted about 1 month.  So, for the past 10 months, I've only taken about 6 GPD, but now is the time to quit, with the intent for this time to be for good.  

I threw everything away except one bottle of about 20 1gm capsules and had done a quick taper.  I also had a doctor prescribe me Xanax that I thought would help with the taper.  I only needed like 5 tablets, but when the doctor wrote #35, I didn't protest.  Long story short, I have been taking 0.5-1gm of Xanax right before bed every night (for 30 days) and one 1gm Kratom capsule every day (for about 10 days) around noon.  So at this point, the Kratom is for sure a psychological addiction.  Before writing this post, I threw away the rest of the Kratom bottle because I know if it's in the house, I'll take it, even if it's only 1gm a day, until it runs out.  The plan with the Xanax was to just use it for a few days to get through the acutes, but a.) it helped me sleep reeeeeally well, and b.) again if it's in the house, I will (and have been) taking it.  

I know this is a Kratom-specific forum, but my concern now is the Xanax.  I have about 8 tabs left.   Is it worth it to try to taper down to 0.5mg and then possibly 0.25 at night, or is 30 days of 1mg not enough to matter?  I also have THC/CBD tincture to help.  I know it is a substance too, but until I figure out how to sleep through the night, I need something.  I have been doing all of the other right stuff- eating well, exercising like crazy, and do feel like I'm shaking Kratom once and for all.  I know if I have any acute WDs from 1gm/ day, they will be minor at best.  Again, my concern is the Xanax.  I know WDs from benzos can be much more serious.

I can’t thank you guys enough. 

At the moment, I feel..   “okay” I guess. My withdrawal symptoms seem to appear randomly, whether Ive dosed or not. The other day I almost considered going to the hospital because my heart was racing and my chest hurt, I soon realized I had caught myself in a panic attack loop while focusing on my heart rate and it just spiraled..    coupled with the panic attacks my symptoms have been awful; heavy chest, random headaches, muscle cramps/tightness, blood pressure spikes, depression, insomnia, and RLS that I pretty much feel all over my body. I finally picked up some supplements today like D3, Calcium + Zinc, and Magnesium Citrate. While Im sure it could just be a placebo Im almost positive Ive felt my blood pressure normalize and I no longer have that “want to climb out my fucking skin” feeling. I want to CT so badly, but I just can’t because of work. Even if the worst of it only lasts 3 or 4 days I just can’t get that much time off or function at work feeling worse than I am now:(   I don’t have much else to say other than fuck this goddamned green garbage, I hate it with every fiber of my being. 4 while fucking years of my life Ive tried many times to stop, but this is it. I want my damn life back, I want to feel again, I want to do more than go to work and lie in bed.

I’ve been on and off kratom for a little over 4 years. I have a litany of depression/anxiety/etc. diagnoses and thought I’d “found the answer”....until my bank account and life tanked. This reddit has been super useful and this community has been amazing. I wish I had found it sooner.

I was having a lot of trouble with alcohol and had a script for naltrexone about 3 years ago. I, nor my psych at the time, had any idea what I would go into precipitated withdrawals from taking the naltrexone while taking kratom. Hell, I took more kratom trying to make it stop. That did not go well. Since then, I’ve managed to stay clean for a few weeks or months here and there, and felt better than I’ve ever remembered feeling, but then some minor inconvenience gives me an excuse to start again. My current psychiatrist is amazing and we’ve decided to try Vivitrol, the monthly naltrexone shit, to help me stay in track. I’m really excited and really ready, but I’m also terrified. 

Has anyone used Vivitrol to help stop their kratom use? My biggest question is how many days I need to be clean before I get the shot. I’m waiting on insurance to clear and went through “regular” withdrawals CT from an ounce a day, and had two days under my belt before I panicked today and bought some at the corner store. I’m an idiot.

I have read all the posts I could find about people self administering naltrexone but not anyone about using the shot. 

Anyone have advice? Anecdotes? Answers from an Oracle? 

I feel like if I could make myself a countdown chart on my fridge like a little kid potty training i could get to the day of the shot without messing it up, but with a big question mark for when it’s going to happen I feel like I’m just going to keep messing it up and then be in PWD and want to just die.

I have been a 16-17gpd Kratom user for like 7 years now and I decided to quit because I went to a doctor during the pandemic with anxiety and we concluded that to really treat the anxiety it would be best to come off the Kratom. So that day I decided to start tapering. I made an initial drop to 11g that day and over the last 12 days I continued to drop little by little.  I am on my second day of 2.4g spread out in 1/4 teaspoons four times a day. I tapered with small doses throughout the day to minimize withdrawals this entire time and I think it helped. 

So I spoke to my Psychiatrist, who has a lot of experience with addiction, and he recommended I go down to 1.2g before I jump. That would mean another week of tapering and getting used to the lowered dose. 

Anyone have an idea of what to expect after I jump? I had a pill problem and got on suboxone in 2013 and took the tiniest amount of suboxone for months before I jumped and it was holy hell for 8 days when I made the mistake of trying kratom because I heard it helped with withdrawls.

I drank at the 2 week mark, which followed with the worst hangover for over 3 day’s. Drinking heavily in the first month or two probably isn’t good for the brain. My hair is still falling out, however I noticed a few baby hairs on my hairline. Everyone keeps saying it’ll stop falling at a month. Also, everyone keeps talking about their sex drive coming back with a vengeance but I haven’t had that so far.

Finding this reddit group has been a big influence in helping me realize I actually want to quit.  I realized I've spent a lot of time cruising reddit and other forums to help me feel more secure in my use over the years and how to sort of ""hack"" fitting this plant into my life in a way without any side effects or downsides, all the while suppressing my intuitive knowing that taking this plant regularly was not actually offering me any real nourishment on the physical, emotional or spiritual level, but rather was getting in the way.  Long story short, I've been in denial and reading through posts in this group gave me the courage to be honest with myself about kratom not working to my benefit in my life right now and finding an authentic wish to quit.

Today its official. I'm not gonna take kratom anymore.  It feels helpful as I begin this journey to share my experience here, and be witnessed in my declaration of my desire and intent to quit.

I'm a 34yr old male. I've been using kratom for over four years (wow, that sounds nuts to hear myself say that.) When it was first introduced to me I had heard about it before, and never really got very curious, and at the time it was offered to me, I was kina like ""Yah, ive been wondering about that stuff for a while, and i got excited to try something new.""  My first experience with 3g of powdered leaf was just lovely and I remember being so excited that I'd found this new thing that felt so good, gave me energy, brightened my mood, gave me motivation, made me feel social and mildly euphoric. It felt like being let in on a secret.  At the time I was considering starting a schooling program, and I have issues with procrastination and motivation to study and I thought ""well now that I have kratom, I'm gonna so successful!"".

I knew enough about Kratom at the time to know that there was potential for addiction and withdrawls, so I was careful throughout most of the time I've been using to keep it to 3-6g per dose, usually only dosing once a day and trying to limit myself to twice a week, with an occasional third day here and there.

Even in the first few months of use, I began noticing that on my off days (especially the afternoon/eve after using the previous day) I would feel kina bleh, a little depressed, and sometimes irritable and in a bad mood in social situations.  I still kept using and sometimes would arrange my life and my use accordingly, knowing that I'd feel one way while using, and another way on my off day.  Sometimes I'd get tired of how this was becoming a focus of my life and how I planned my time and social life, and would take a break for weeks at a time, but usually with the ""prize"" of taking kratom again on some blissful afternoon in the future being a bit of a driver for abstaining.

This has been my pattern for most of time, and then...Pandemic hit, and i was unemployed, stressed about navigating all the social dynamics of exposure and risk of the virus  ( I live with quite a few folks), and l was separated from my partner due to Covid-19 concerns, and I started using more kratom.  As soon as I let myself take it for consecutive days, and dosing twice or more in a day, the slope got slippery.  For the last 2 months or so I've still managed to to have one kratom free day a week, but on those days I always took phenibut, and usually I was telling my self that I would be taking two or three days off, but always caved and used the next day.

I had a bit of a routine going where I'd have two or three days of using up to 10g and then kind of taper back a day or two and then low dose the first day after my day off, and repeat.

I know that many folks here have used far more for longer and struggled with withdrawals and quitting in ways that don't compare to my experience.  That said, over the past few months kratom has obviously become a part of my life that I just don't want, its taken up a lot of my attention and focus to keep control of my use and lust for it and its been really hard until now to be honest with myself and acknowledge the impact its having on my life and realize that I have an attachment to it that I want to be free of.  Its really hard to give up. I'm sitting here on day two and feeling low energy, hard to access positive mood or excitement or pleasure and I totally long for a dose of even 2 grams just to feel a little boost and brightness and gladness.  It feels like  a leap of faith in these moments that not using will be worth it and I'm treating it like a long term project.  The last two days have been my first kratom free days without phenibut for around 2 months.  I'm fuqn doin this people!

2020-06-26 21:29:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/hgkhi6/so_bummed_out_right_now/,So bummed out right now.,"I went through a really rough patch in life over 2 years ago. A 10+ year relationship ended and it left me feeling pretty empty. She cheated on me. We were engaged, have 2 children, had been together since we were teenagers. I tried to keep us together and forgive her but she wouldn't end her relationship with the other guy. She kept lying about it and I kept finding out. So, of course, when it became clear I was wasting my time, I left her before she could leave me. Obviously, my heart was in a million pieces. The girl I'd loved for 10 years didn't want me anymore and I could no longer come home to my sweet little babies. 

I moved into a place with a roommate, and tried to  forge ahead as best as I could. Depression set in. I had beaten an opioid addiction in my early 20s and coached myself almost daily that I wouldn't relapse. That doing that would just compound my problems, despite the overwhelming desire I had to escape from my new lonely life and broken heart. 

Fast forward about two months. I went downtown to get a haircut one day. There was an interesting head shop next door, so I popped in just to browse afterwards. I noticed their extensive kratom selection, so I started talking to an employee there about it. I'd tried it when WDing during my prior addiction and was very cautious about how much I used, therefore I didn't feel very much and wrote it off as useless and never tried it again. But the employee at this head shop six years later made it sound like some kind of miracle drug and told me if you take too little, you might not feel anything. So I bought some and swallowed 10 capsules on the way home. As soon as I felt them, I knew I was in for trouble. A legal opoid you can just buy almost anywhere. I felt amazing. 

I carelessly dosed every day after that, while also increasing how much I took rather quickly. At this point, everything I knew about kratom minimized the withdrawal symptoms and had me believing I would just stop with minor issues, if any. So I tried to stop one day when I felt like the party was over. And it sucked. I couldn't stop. I started to feel more and more hopeless as kratom began to sink it's claws into my life. I had anxiety about being dependent on a substance yet again. That was a year ago.

This January, I finally mustered up the courage and got time off of work to jump off kratom. Tapering was out of the question. I have literally no self-control when it comes to drugs. I spent the night of my last dose almost euphoric about quitting, ready to have my life back, to have disposable income again, to feel again, to be the man I'm supposed to be for my children. So I did it. The next 21 days, I didn't take any kratom and truly felt better for it. It sucked at first, but it was worth the pain. Music sounded better than ever. I wasn't numb. Little things made me want to cry and I felt so proud of myself. 

Here is my main reason for writing this. Notice how that only lasted 21 days. I got complacent, like I had amnesia about the nightmare I'd finally woken up from. I had a particularly heavy workload on that 22nd day, and told myself I could dose one more day and that I'd be fine. Take it from me, someone who is currently taking the highest doses I've ever taken, who is currently trying to figure out once again how to get my life back. You can't take it for just one more day. One day becomes two becomes three becomes June 26th in the midst of a global pandemic numbing yourself to everything around you. The WDs are worse this time around. I know because I tried to quit again a couple months ago and it was too brutal to even make it 24 hours into the jump. I caved because I just couldn't stand being so miserable. Don't take it for one more day. Please.

I plan on jumping again soon. I've been telling myself to taper but I've been failing miserably again. I have to end this though, eventually. I want to still be alive and independent once it's finally over. 

I'm putting in my time off requests tonight and getting myself mentally prepared. We are all so much better than this stuff makes us behave. I don't want to be a zombie floating through life. I want to hurt. I want to love. I want to feel.",48,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.49411976}"

I've been using   probably 25-30 GPd for 2 or 3 months now. I'm expecting this to be a cake walk compared to my fentanyl withdrawal but some of the posts on here have me worried. Is anyone out there that has been in my shoes and can compare them for me so I know what to expect. I'm about 18 hours since my last dose and I do notice some common withdrawal symptoms but they are very mild I was even able to go grocery shopping and at points forgot I was even feeling shitty. During my fentanyl withdrawal at this point I couldn't even walk, eat or leave my bed for atleast a week sweating buckets.  Will it get worse since I'm only 18 hours in or are some of these kratom horror stories only based off people that have been abusing kratom for multiple years every day?

I just wanted to post a story about me that maybe helps other people, on this moment friday 00:00 (technically saturday) 14 days ago i took my last dose of kratom and i went trough a hell the first 3 days, i had no sleep ,back pain ,emotional , rls. But than i visited the dokter and told her about my kratom addiction and that i was 3 days clean but no sleep.

She gave me some lorazepam 2.5mg only 5 and i used some drugs in the weekends with friends, alcohol coke 3mmc. But after a week i was fealing much better and the dokter helped me alot. I would advice everyone to go to the docter especially if you're from holland they will give you some help. For the rls magnesium helped a lot and not magnesiumbyslycinaat or something but magnesium citrate or oxide can do the job aswell. 

My biggest help was my paper where i wrote the pro's and con's of kratom. And the only reason i didnt want to quit is because i was so scared about the withdrawal, had it 2 times that i couldnt sleep for 2 days or 3 and just bought more to sleep. I ate around 50 grams a day for a year and it helped me to do my job and be stabile in my emotions.

Now im 14 days clean and i have no cravings or anything im so happy i left this shit. No spoons in my bag or bags of kratom at work sneaking to the toilet with a plastic cup to take a dose. No sneaky shit for my friends only 2 people knew about it, i was to ashamed to talk about it.

The problems i tried to put away with the kratom are back but im finally going to a psychiatrist so they will help me with everything thats wrong with me probably ADHD or Bipolar disorder.

And im free of it the green shit i feel much better in my body both my underarm where covered with orange white spots and they al dissapeared.

It’s been well over a month now since the last time I took kratom and I’m so much better off. I finally see what everyone else in this thread has been talking about.

I know it’s hard guys and gals and I know there will be slip-ups along the way but I can say that if you give your body time to regulate itself, life gets so much better.

I’m back to playing the guitar, carrying the doggo for walks and not feeling so tired before, during and after. I underestimated the addictive nature of kratom. I thought because it’s natural it would be okay. But I can tell you, it’s bad stuff, no fucking bueno.

Wanted to make this as a little update thread and maybe get some opinions.

Currently have a 40gpd addiction to kratom. Found this stuff around a year ago when I was in search of something to combat depression because of some financial issues I was having. Never had a history of drug abuse of any sort but anyway I came across kratom online and read a few things on it from other people about how amazing it was and how all the different strains made you feel which was more then enough to make me order some to try. Took like 3 or 4 500mg caps my first time of the white maeng and wow I thought I hit the jackpot. I couldn’t believe how much energy, motivation, and euphoria it gave me. I kept the dose pretty low for a couple months taking it every once in a while but like most drugs I had to increase it to feel the same effects. 

Once I figured out that this stuff was being sold all over my town (malls, smokeshops, gas stations) and I didn’t have to order it online it started becoming a problem and a everyday habit. At the time I had never experienced drug withdrawal before so I wasn’t exactly sure why on some days I was feeling so awful and waking up in the middle of the night with terrible RLS thought it might just be a side effect of the Kratom or something so decided maybe it was time to quit. Got through the first 24 hours but then started feeling super sick runny nose, yawning, chills, body twitching on top of horrible depression and anxiety. I had no idea what was going on until I took a dose of kratom and every symptom I had vanished so I kind of put 2 and 2 together and knew I was withdrawing.

I have tried a few times now to CT it and power myself through it but hardly being able to make it through a couple days before caving in. Nowadays this stuff is just completely ruining my life and financially screwing me spending almost 70 bucks a week. Used to be active and in really good shape but now just find myself going home after work feeling exhausted and miserable. I have huge bags under my eyes because I sleep horribly and usually wake up in the middle of the night with good old RLS. I just throw some clothes on in the morning and go to work not really giving a shit if I look presentable or not family members and co workers have noticed this as well. Kratom does absolutely nothing for me now maybe a hour of feeling decent at most just taking it to avoid withdrawing. Wake up everyday just scared and questioning myself on how I put myself in this situation and it’s taking a huge toll on my mental health

I’m 30 years old and want to just come out about it to my parents and get the help I need but after browsing on here about some possible taper plans and successful quitting stories I feel determined and would like to give this one more good try. I’m going to aim for a slow taper dropping 500mg every 1-2 days. I started Monday and feeling good about it wish me luck thanks for reading.

I’m 24 hours in. I’ve had a habit 2 years and couldn’t even tell you how much I was dosing. Prob 35 plus GPD. I’ve quit twice before for a week or so but stupidly went back thinking I could control my intake.

This week I’ve felt super dehydrated. My wife was worried I had COVID so asked me to go the dr. I went, they did urine test, blood test, Covid  test. Urine test came back that I was a little dehydrated and blood test came that I had very elevated liver enzymes and white blood count! I am normally very healthy, a runner. I don’t drink at all but the dr was questioning me on my alcohol consumption. I didn’t mention Kratom. I was given IV fluids and felt much better.

 I decided I needed to get off this shit for good. I was going to taper but the thought of it makes me disgusted now. I didn’t take any yesterday afternoon or this morning. I went for a run when I woke up and felt a little fatigued after. I had one .5mg capsule but nothing since. I just stocked up on electrolytes.

I knew no happiness, felt no pain or joy, hated who i was and what i did, ignored all those who loved me, and slowly continued to spiral my life out of control which spiraled me further and further into depression and anxiety. I lived in a place of fear. I thought I'd never be sober, and knew that if I'd never be sober, then I had to accept my life with kratom. But as I looked to the future, I only saw more of the same or worse. Kratom wasnt satisfying me anymore and eventually I wouldve wanted to go back to the stronger opiates who were once my only friend. As low as I felt, I couldnt stand the thought of the pain being worse. THE PAIN I FELT WHILE USING WAS WORSE THAN THE THOUGHT OF GETTING SOBER. I was given the gift of desperation. I craved a spiritual awakening, a new beginning, a new me. But I was scared shitless and had SO much self doubt. I used my kratom high to come up with a plan to get sober, rather than getting high and crying on the floor of the shower. After I researched for weeks, I gathered up all the supplies I'd need to detox, cleaned my house, and went grocery shopping. What happened next surprised even me. Idk where the courage came from but I flushed 3 kilos. When I did that, I also flushed the disillusionment kratom held me under. I cried out ""help me."" I begged ""help me."" And then something helped me. I became so desperate for help, that I was WILLING to do whatever it took to be not only sober, but also be the best version of myself, to find myself. I've put in some work let me tell you. And it's been a roller coaster. But I'm sober today. 60 days today. And I can't even believe it. What's more surprising, kratom was the source of my problems, not the solution to them like I thought. If you're new, you have 2 choices: you can keep on the path you're on that eventually leads you to a miserable death, or you can go through the TEMPORARY physical and mental pain that will lead you to a happy life of purpose. I always thought being sober would suck. After 17 years of addiction, I've never been happier. Hold on to your hope. You can do this too!

Been having pretty awful fatigue and motivation issues. My coworker who quit Kratom last year suggested phenibut. Being pretty desperate for a solution and finding none with the less intense supplements and exercise, I am giving phenibut a try. 

500mg every 3rd day. It does seem to be working, or at least augmenting my current regime very well. I know it's addictive and quitting it CT is worse than Kratom. Plan is to use for 3 weeks, then off a week and see if it has helped me to cope better, or maybe just time will heal. 500mg is seen as a therapeutic dose, not recreational. I really don't feel much from it, but my moods have evened out and my energy level has returned to almost normal. Although with Kratom my energy level was through the roof, which was why I used it. Never gonna see those levels again, but at least I can go to work and have enough left in the tank to do some work around the house when I get home. Not really sure this was the greatest decision, but my coworker used phenibut and quit it after a month, hoping I can follow the same arc. Awfully gun-shy about using anything else with a withdrawal after the Kratom fiasco, but something had to give or I was going to slip back into using. 

Just a side note, but I did talk to my MD about the issues I was having and his solution was anti-depressants, which seemed less appealing to me.

I was using about 21 gbd of the damn Meng da for 10 months. Wow writing that out really put it into perspective for me. That is the indicative theme of my whole Kratom habit, head in the sand the whole way through. I started at 12 capsules and ended at 12 capsules because I never knew there was so many options and ways to take it bc I never, ever looked. I wasn’t even sure of the full extent of the WDs I’d go through until I looked on this thread 2 days before I finally decided to stop CT. And I panicked!

I am an addict by nature so taper is not an option, never worked in any other detoxing I’ve tried before. I always say screw it and dose myself the usual, bc of course, if I got it I’m using it. 

The way I figured out about this sneaky little opioid binder was recently around 4 hours after my last dose id start to feel the WD symptoms associated w heroin WD. Yawning, runny nose, watery eyes, stomach issues, RLS at night and my “leg alarm clock” was sure to wake me up early every morning to remind me to dose. I was all too familiar w this and I knew it had to end. I mean I’m not getting high enough to experience this kinda fall.

So my days of CT have not included any of those symptoms except the dreaded RLS, but minor in comparison to my suboxen or heroin WD. Sleep has been ok, not great. I feel antsy a lot and energy is at a low, but like I said in my experience it far pales in comparison to the other opioid antagonists I’ve dealt with. The anxiety today was not good and this is to be expected. I’ve turned that faucet off for almost a year so when I feel anxiety in any measure the alarms go off. I have to accept life comes with anxiety, it doesn’t mean the sky is falling and most importantly It doesn’t mean I have to dose again. 

Anyway I dragged on for way longer than I expected, i love this thread it’s made me not feel alone. I would always look for someone on here that was gonna tell me it’s not going to be hell on earth. In my opinion it’s not hell on earth. it’s uncomfortable, it’s inconvenient, it sucks, but true hell on earth is being a slave to any substance.

I bought my usual 250 grams last week and said to myself I'd use the first 125 as I usually do which is multiple times a day but then I blew through that in less than a week. The other 125 that I was going to use to taper I hardly cut down usage at all. Now I'm almost out and I'm stuck between the decision of spend $50 and buy another 250 and seriously try and taper with it this time or just quit cold turkey. I think if I try and taper this time it will just be the same as last time and I'll blow through it all in a week or two. I'm thinking at this point it might be best to just cold turkey quit. I've quit before and it sucks I can't sleep for a couple weeks I'm not looking forward to this at all.,3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.62685233}"

I am still on my taper, going down roughly 1.5 gpd every 4 days. Yesterday I went down from 7 gpd to 5.6 gpd which is the amount I'm staying on today, tomorrow, and Saturday. 

When I say I'm tapering-- well, obviously that means I'm still using kratom at the moment.

And, this morning I woke up suddenly feeling way better than I have since I started quitting (a good few weeks here). I mean, I don't feel ""great,"" but I am noticeably less lethargic. The extreme lethargy, to the point where I could barely pull myself out of bed or off the couch, and everything hurts when I so much as try to take a walk, was literally 24/7 from when I started my quit process until this morning. It didn't let up for a single second at any time. Now, it has, all of a sudden, just like that. I don't exactly want to run a marathon, but I can walk around just fine, and can finally start making some real progress on cleaning my house.

Just wondering if anyone else had a similar experience--how normal is this? Did I just ""get lucky""?... questions like this are running through my head. I am remaining humble and not letting myself ride on any pink cloud of ""alright, this must mean things are gravy from here on in!""

I posted about 1 year ago after seeing an addictions specialist and feeling completely lost.  Thank you again to everyone who responded; it helped very much.  I have copied my original post below, but long story short, the doctor I saw prescribed me suboxone and gave me no option of any other intervention.  I got a lot of different perspectives and pieces of advice here on what I should do.

I met with my doctor again before starting on the Suboxone.  He once again reassured me that the taper off suboxone would be easy, and when I brought up some of the concerns raised on this forum, he dismissed them as untrue.  He also reassured me that I would be off of this medication in 2 months.  So I started taking the suboxone. I took a low dose - 2mg - instead of the 8 mg that my doctor suggested I would need. At this point, I had not taken Kratom for a couple days, had not slept, felt very achy and incredibly anxious all the time.  The first time I took it, the relief was so fast and so complete.  I was relieved immediately of all my anxiety, my pain, my restlessness. I felt happy and hopeful for the first time in a long time.  I also felt sleepy.  I know now that I was actually getting a bit high from the suboxone.  It was, I am sure, only a tiny fraction of the sense of calm, content, happy feeling that taking stronger or a higher dose of opioids provides, but it felt like the thing that was missing from my life. It felt like I finally felt okay in my own skin in the world.  I recognized fairly quickly (thankfully) that I would need to be pretty careful and get off of this drug quickly. I am also thankful I did not take the 8 mg the doctor suggested. I think I would be in a much different place right now if I did.  It also appears, based on how I reacted, that I am quite sensitive to this drug and metabolize it quickly.  The withdrawal effects (particularly restless legs) would return by the end of the day if I took it in the morning.

I began the taper quickly after starting. My doctor told me to cut the pills in half and start taking only 1 mg per day.  This was really, really shitty.  The emotional symptoms I experiened were rediculous. I was irritable, angry, anxious, depressed.  Overwhelmingly so.  I had restless legs and slept maybe a couple hours per night.  Managing these symptoms until I adjusted to the lower dose was exhausting.  Once I had adjusted to that dose, he asked me to skip one day per week.  Again, this was absolutely exhausting. It was also very difficult on my relationship, as I was a nightmare to spend time with. (At this point, I had been totally honest with my partner about Kratom and suboxone, so she did know what was happening and why.)  I know this is not a surpirse to any of you, but suboxone is NOT EASIER TO WITHDRAW FROM THAN KRATOM.  I started getting really upset regularly that the doctor had put me on this medication that was so, so much stronger than what I was taking previously. I could not let it go, which was also causing my some distress. And was keeping me up at night.

3 months later, and I am definitely NOT off of suboxone. Not even close. I am so burned out from the emotional rollercoaster that I ask to stop tapering temporarily so I can emotionally stabilize.  I starting taking kratom for depression and anxiety, and depression and anxiety was coming back 10 fold through all of this.  My doctor agreed to this, and also told me he was leaving and I needed to switch to a new doctor.  This is also when I found out that this doctor had no experience with addictions medicine, I was his first patient, and he had never prescribed suboxone before he prescribed it to me.  I felt pretty upset about this.

My new doctor was AMAZING.  He actually listened to me and tried to understand what I was going through.  My previous doctor would tell me that the symptoms I was experiencing were impossible at the dose I was on, that it was impossible for the anti-withdrawal effects of suboxone to wear off within  24 hours, that there were no medications that would help with this.  With the previous doctor, I would sometimes come to appointments requesting to reduce my dose sooner than we had planned, and I explained I had extra pills because I was reducing my dose.  He would keep interpreting this as me trying to get high on them, and assuming I had taken MORE than my prescribed dose when I kept explaining I was taking LESS.  My new doctor did none of these things.  He also switched me off of suboxone and on to BuTrans patch.  He also gave me a low dose of clonidine to take when I tapered down if I got withdrawal symptoms.  He started me on anti-depressant medication. He would actually listen to me and believe me.  I was very relieved.

BuTrans was a much better medication for me.  It is a extended release buprenorphine patch that you put on weekly.  Buprenorphine is the same medication as suboxone without the naloxone.  It comes in various strengths, all the way down to a tiny dose.  I started on 2 of the highest strength patches per week, and reduced monthly.  This was so, so much better. Gone was the daily emotional rollercoaster that suboxone had me on. The taper was much gentler and more gradual.  I did notice the patch wearing off on day 5, and so my doctor prescribed me a patch every 5 days instead of 7.  Instead of telling me that was impossible, he believed me and helped me.  He is now my family doctor as well.

About 2 months ago, I stopped taking the patches altogether.  I was down to 5 micrograms per hour, or .12 mg of buprenorphine per day.  Even at a dose that low, I had withdrawal symptoms for about 2 weeks.  The major ones at that point were back ache, anxiety, insomnia, and restless legs.  But it was manageable, and I was given clonidine and zopiclone for 1.5 weeks.  I am now off of all medications other than my antidepressant (Wellbutrin) and feel okay.  My mood has stabilized significantly. I still sometimes get very mild restlessness at night, but not every night and if I take an Aleve I can get right back to sleep.

This was a bumpy ride for me.  It really sent me spinning into bad mental health place for a while.  I am not sure why I am writing this out, other than for my own sense of closure.  I started this journey with that first post and I am glad to end it with this last one. I know this is a lot to read, but it really did feel important to write it all out.  I know a lot of people have gone through way worse experiences than I have, and I have a newfound respect and understanding for them.

If you read this far; thank you for listening. If you have any questions I will try to answer them.

TL;DR Suboxone sucks, BuTrans sucks a bit less. Bad doctors suck, good doctors rock.

Hello.

I have been using Kratom for about 1 year. Currently about 12g per day. No one in my life knows about this.

I recently went to my doctor and spoke with him about needing to quit. I told him I do not have and have never had any other addictions. I told him I did not know that kratom was addictive when I started taking it (which is true, but stupid of me). He had never heard of kratom before and referred me to an addictions specialist at a hospital nearby. Today was my first appointment there.

I told the doctor I met with what my withdrawal symptoms were and that I would like to stop using kratom but that I need to continue working. I told him I was hoping there was some medication that might help me with the temporary physical withdrawal so I could keep working and not suffer too much. I get really bad restless leg, body aches, fatigue. Can't sleep or work feeling like that.

The doctor I met with has given me a prescription for Suboxone. I told him my worries, but he told me that getting off Suboxone is much easier, and I can expect to have minimal withdrawal symptoms. I told him I was scared of this drug, as in my mind Suboxone is for heroin/hardcore opiate addiction and I had heard stories of people getting addicted to it and having a really hard time coming off of it. I told him I would like to try to taper or cold turkey kratom with some help. He consulted with his colleagues and came back to tell me that Suboxone was the best bet, and he cannot prescribe anything to manage withdrawal symptoms unless I am in an in-patient detox (which isn't available anyway). He told my not to taper, but to not taking any kratom for the next 2 days and then start taking the suboxone.

So I have the prescription for Suboxone now, and I have no prescriptions for anything else. I am not sure what to do. I am still scared to take this drug.

Honestly, I have been crying a lot and feel really, really alone in this. Sorry if that's ridiculous; I know people have worse problems than this. I just feel scared and alone and unsure of what to do. I am a grown man and I cannot believe this is what is happening in my life. I feel very ashamed and embarrassed.

Looking for any kind of advice on what to do in this situation. I have no one to talk to. I can take the next 2 days off work, and my last dose of kratom was at 8:00 AM. I feel physical discomfort, restlessness, fatigue already. Can I get through this without the suboxone? Should I take it? I don't know what to do. I still have a lot of kratom in my home. I need to be able to function at work.

Sorry for the rambling post. I really appreciate any advice. Thank you.",7,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5709036}"

Three weeks ago, I decided to quit again after losing my girlfriend. I tapered everyday to make sure I was on track. The sweating and diarrhea was awful but I dealt with it. What really helped me and might help you is to record every single day your sleep, how you feel when waking up, and your dosage throughout the day and what symptoms you are feeling. After a while, if you can stick to the withdrawals, you start to realize everything diminishes to barely anything.

I honestly thought I would never shake this habit and I always thought I would need to take it to prevent sweating everyday. I can happily say that those symptoms are now nonexistent. I was on about 6g-10g a day. It took me losing everything for me to realize I don’t need this horrible drug anymore.

I started getting sick of taking so much of it that I would switch back to painkillers. 

Interesting thing happened. The painkillers didn’t do anything for me. AT ALL. It was as if I was taking an ibuprofen. So I continued with using Kratom. 

I am now Day 7 (2 of which I dosed) with my last dose being Sunday (2 tsp dose). From the start I had runny nose. And as the day count continued, extreme restless leg and arm jolting at night. I’ve had stomach pain and diarrhea. And was up all of last night, worked through today and am hoping I fall asleep tonight. (Prayers)

       Testosterone was so low in a past blood draw that I was on the borderline of receiving treatment for low T.  Kratom will naturally suppress your testosterone levels after long term use.  Lower sex drive, lower energy and lower muscle growth.  I'm only 37 btw
       My cortisol levels were almost 3 TIMES normal range.  Cortisol is the stress hormone.  High cortisol can cause extreme stress, depression and anxiety...I just never noticed because I was always so high everyday that I was numb to everything going on around me.  Also, it's one of the reasons why when you quit, all this hits you at once, until your body evens itself out.
       Diagnosed with hypothyroidism, which is your thyroid gland functioning below normal levels.  I was given medication to boost my thyroid function.  The thyroid gland has direct ties with your adrenal gland.  Adrenal fatigue from kratom is real people...
        Besides the hormones, at year 4 of kratom use, a whole shit load of my joints started to hurt all at once.  Both my knees, my left elbow and my wrists.  I even got tested for every autoimmune disease under the sun because it was so sudden.  Tested negative for rheumatoid arthritis and everything else.  At first kratom was relief from addiction and aches and pains, but after so long, it becomes the cause of so much more.
       If you have a significant other depending on how much love they have for you, is how much they will deal with.  I'm one of the lucky ones that has a ride or die girl, but the change that happens to your emotions and attention to others changes so dramatically that Im surprised I'm not single, lol.
       All in all, I know some people will disagree, but kratom will devour you whole if you let it.  I can understand if it helps with debilitating pain to the point you dont mind being a zombie, but for some of us fighting addiction it should be a country you run through, not build a house in.
       Iv'e been clean now for about a month or so and blood test came out fine.  Also, the natural energy is amazing and I feel myself again.  Good luck, just wanted to share some of the effects kratom had on ME.  I know not everyone gets detailed bloods done routinely so I thought I would share what kratom can do to your body after long term use.  My joints are feeling much better already and even my skin tone is brighter!  Life is great and I hope everyone stays safe and God Bless!",23,{'immun': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6176497}"

Kratom, especially when I was fully indulging in it (40 to 50 gpd habit), seemed to make me urinate quite a lot. But, I have yet to see anyone here or elsewhere describing it as having a diuretic effect, and when I look at lists of kratom symptoms online I don't tend to see it listed (I think one list I saw made the vague statement ""urinary changes"").

Some might say ""nah dude, you've got something else going on""--and, I may. But the excessive urination has very noticeably often happened soon after kratom dosing.

I'm starting the gentlest taper I can tomorrow. I've been a daily user for about a year and a half to 2 years and I'm currently up to 24 grams a day...

I am 100% convinced kratom has caused an insane cross tolerance to my prescribed ADHD medication Adderall. I've tried every tolerance reduction method physically possible from my ADHD meds with absofuckinglutely NO difference in tolerance besides it STILL GOING UP. It's to the point now where the 30mg IR Adderall that I took to get me out of bed, keep me awake, focus me and motivate me thoroughly doesn't do any of that anymore. I honestly went up to as much as 60+ mg and I still kept falling asleep against my will with no improvement in focus, thought clarity, nap reduction or motivation. (The extreme lethargy and oversleeping is something my doctor and I are currently looking into so don't mind that).

Has anyone else tapered off of krapom 💩 and the effects of their stim ADHD medication came back during the taper? If so, how far into the taper like how much less krapom did you take at the point where your ADHD meds started working again?

This is EXTREMELY important because I've been out of work during this pandemic conveniently while my ADHD meds stopped being effective. I can NOT go back to work until my ADHD meds are even a little more effective. I'm an EMT at a very high call volume station. If I can't focus and stay focused like I always could before on my meds someone could die. So if nobody hads gotten the efficacy of their ADHD meds back during their taper I'll have a better idea of if I should wait even longer to put myself as available for work again. But I'd like to go back ASAP. But I will not go back (as long as it's possible) if it means being unfocused and foggy and risking my patient's lives and health. 

And no CT is not an option for me. I've tried it before and it made me very physically ill, I never slept, and I was so tired and miserable I laid in bed all day. I got full custody of my AMAZING 4 year old niece a few months ago and she needs me functioning to a certain degree to care for her and give her the life she DESERVES!

I am tapering and it is going well, I'm doing everything as planned, weighing to the 0.1 gram with anal precision, no cheating on the amounts, no delaying the dose reductions. My mood is manageable, and I am at least able to function. But, the depression is real. I *never* want to get out of bed, I spend almost the entire day on the couch, and if I so much as take a walk each second is like an eternity until I can physically relax again. 

One silver lining to this is that my anxiety has disappeared. I  had been taking 0.5 mg Xanax on average twice a day almost every day for, I don't know, maybe 2-3 months straight (while still taking kratom, before starting my taper). Now, I am taking zero. I have not been needing it, at all. I have little to no anxiety. This is quite good, because I'm conserving my Xanax.

BUT-- I suspect that the only reason I'm not having anxiety is that the depression is overriding it, and once my taper is finished and eventually the depression starts to lift (part of me wonders if it ever actually will, but that's another topic for another time) the anxiety will come back with ""rebound strength"" as if it's out in the hallway doing pushups in a ""oh, you thought you could get rid of me, that's cute"" kind of way.

Let me know if anyone has gone through any variation of this experience, and bonus points if you can describe how you dealt with the depression, rebound anxiety, etc.  Thanks in advance for any responses.",2,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5271296}"

A little background of what led me to this decision:
I began using kratom in the beginning of 2019 and it the beginning, it was strictly used to up my productivity at work.  As time went on, I got pretty heavy into using it. Here we are, a year and a half later and I'm dosing 50-60g a day. I'm a 29 year old female and weigh about 120 pounds. I've watched my life crumble into shambles as it ruined how my brain was wired. In the summer of 2019, I started having the worst anxiety in my life. I couldn't leave the house some days, and I chalked it up to just how i was. Earlier this year, I left my boyfriend of 4 years because I was so unhappy with life in general, and started dating someone new. I realized I was still so unhappy and probably will never be happy. I've completely ruined my life as I knew it along with other people's lives because I wasn't myself anymore. In the end of 2019, I started to feel like I just wasn't myself anymore and couldn't figure out why. I got really self destructive. Taking kratom to mask my pain, drinking almost every night and doing cocaine daily. I thought my unhappiness was from drinking and coke, so I stopped that and then it got even worse. I've hit rock bottom. I've pushed everyone around me away. I had no one. In late may, I had a realization that these problems have been caused from my insane addiction to this plant. But, instead of trying to stop, I started using it more. Yesterday it hit me all again. I'm the only person who has the ability to change this. I reached out to my ex boyfriend of 4 years and finally told him the cause of our worlds to separate. He was a kratom user, and got off of it and walked me through how to get off of it. I'm scared about the withdrawals a little, as I've never in my life have gone through addiction like this before. But I have a system, and I'm ready to get my mind back. I'm ready to be able to feel actual emotions again and I'm ready to not let this plant run and dictate my life. In 12 days, I'm hoping to take my last dose and then be done. I'm going to start working out daily and get my life together. I've been reading on here since may, and decided it's time.
Thank you for reading my story. Hopefully anyone going through something similar will have the courage to stop too.",36,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8023661}"

So I’ve been on suboxone for 1.5 years (8mg) and finally made the decision to get off over a month ago. I’ve made it 39 days. Kicking it was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done.

Back story is that doctors put me on suboxone for a 2 year kratom dependency. I don’t want to tell anyone what to do, but in my experience I was not educated on what exactly MAT entailed; the maintenance program, the serious side effects, and the WITHDRAWAL. I totally grant that some people’s dependence may be such that they need a monitored MAT to be healthy, but if someone had said just tough out the withdrawals for a week or two and you’ll be done, or trade it for the extreme 45-60 withdrawals of suboxone, I definitely would have toughed it out. This lack of educational awareness is a huge blindside regarding MAT treatment modalities, especially for kratom dependence.

Anyways, my story is that after 2–3 weeks of debilitating withdrawals, I broke down and bought some kratom. It was a risky move, but if you scroll the r/suboxone almost every taper and cold turkey plan included people incorporating various amounts of kratom. I eventually began a 20-60 capsule (I don’t know what that is in grams. I can’t do the toss and wash/wash and toss. The smell of kratom literally makes me wretch) about every other day for the past two weeks. Yesterday, my fiancé, who is aware of the kratom history, found my kratom bottle while looking through the car. She went apoplectic, naturally, and it’s been thin ice since she found out. She’s understanding in that she knows withdrawals are difficult, but is disappointed I didn’t discuss it with her. I love her, and know she would have been understanding, but I wanted to take kratom and I knew that if I told her she would have talked me out of it. Now I have absolutely no choice but to stop taking kratom. Luckily I didn’t develop a dependence this time and the only thing I still have to face is the suboxone withdrawals, which at this point are more mental than physical. Were moving to Tennessee where it is illegal so I doubt I will have the motivation to covertly order it online and hide it from my fiancé; I’m ready for this to be over, for her and for me.

Anyways, just wanted to share my experience and say thanks to this forum. It’s been helpful. And there is hope! Being suboxone free, even with a little kratom, has been the first time I felt like myself since before I started taking drugs. And now I’m so close to being free of both. Y’all are beautiful; hang in there!

I’ve been really trying hard to taper but I’m not as far along in my taper as I would have liked. After chatting with a few of you i thought maybe it would be best to push my quit date out a little bit so I can continue to taper. After some thought I decided, I just can’t push it out. I’m so desperate to get off this stuff. Some things I realized about quitting: 
1. The anticipation is always worse than the reality. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still hard AF! But the worst of it is over in 4-7 days and what’s a week compared to the rest of my life. 
2. Quitting isn’t even the hardest part of the battle. The real battle is staying quit so the sooner I can get over the first hurdle, the better. 
3.  I’ve quit many times, all CT. So I figured some tapering has got to be better than quitting CT.
4. The longer I push out my quit date, the more opportunity I have for prolonging the cycle that I tend to fall into. 

I also contacted a doctor about getting gabapentin to which the doctor told me there was nothing he could do to help 🙄🙄🙄🙄 So I’m going to do this without the assistance of medication which is how I’ve always done it. I wish I could get some medication to help but it doesn’t appear that I will be able to get a doctor’s appointment before my quit date. 
A few things that I’ve found to be helpful is Valerian root, gaba calm mind, b complex, St. John’s wort, black seed oil, thc, Imodium (recommended doses, used as intended) and magnesium.
I’m also going to be trying a few things that were recommended to me: agmatine, niacin, natural calm magnesium and kava kava. I’ve actually tried kava before and did’t feel like it did much of anything but I was told I didn’t use enough. I’m going to try to increase the amount I use but am a little apprehensive since they have kidney and liver warnings (not sure how it compares to the damage that large doses do Kratom causes). For those who have used kava, let me know how much you’re using.

If I dosed several times a day, I would feel sick even at such low doses, which I thought was a little odd. (I drink a ton of water by the way, so its not because I'm dehydrated) I almost always drink a few beers with the kratom when I take it at night. (Sorry liver) With the negative side effects I decided it's time to quit because I worry about the long term effects. 

Day 1. Went about the day as normal, only difference is that at night i had a few beers, this time without kratom. Went to bed, woke up at 3am with a terrible feeling in my chest. I've never suffered from anxiety, and I've always thought of it as a mental thing. As in, constantly stressing and worrying about things, but is that what it is? This terrible feeling was like the middle of my chest was super hyper, I dont know how to explain it. Almost as if I couldn't lay still. Just really uncomfortable, and impossible to sleep with. Is this anxiety? Such an unbearable feeling. I literally thought to myself, laying in bed in the middle of the night, that I might be getting ready to have a heart attack. For reference, I'm 6 foot tall, 185 pounds.

After about 2 hours of trying to ignore the feeling, I finally took some melatonin and it slowly let me fall back to sleep. I kept waking up with the feeling about every hour but I was able to fight it off and fall back asleep for a while. It's now noon of the same day, and I still have a bit of the feeling, just not as intense.

I've quit smoking tobacco after 2 years, I quit smoking pot after several years, and I've never had any withdrawals when I quit that stuff years ago, surprisingly. I thought I was just a lucky person. But this has to be kratom withdrawal, even after just quitting 1 day. Its certain to get worse. I'm a very relaxed and calm person, never anxious but it's like I've developed anxiety now? Not in my mind, but my body has developed it, if that makes sense? It's really bothersome.

What I'm grateful for now.,"Things I have to remember when those sneaky thoughts creep into my brain. These are mine. **What are yours?** Please comment. They might help me and others. Thank you.

**Why I quit and need to stay quit:** 

Kratom no longer ""treated"" what I initially took it for. 

I was obviously physically and mentally addicted to it. 

I used it as a crutch. 

HAD TO have it first thing in the morning. 

Couldn't sleep without it. 

For me, after 3 years of daily use, it made my back pain worse. 

I cut myself off from loved ones. 

I cut myself off from my self. 

**What I'm grateful for today, day 4, after a successful 7 week taper (after trying to taper for 1 ½ years):** 

I'm finally starting to sleep better (5 hours last night). 

I no longer get ""those itches"". 

I haven't had those nearly unbearable random ""hot flashes"" and sweats in over a week. 

I don't have to stop whatever I'm doing 3 - 4 times a day to dose. 

I don't have to eat around my Kratom schedule - I can eat when I choose to. 

I don't have to carry around a little container of green powder when traveling or at work and fear what others will think or say. 

I don't nod out now. 

I talk more. 

I'm not pushing people away.

I am currently on day 85 ish of no Kratom after 6 years of use. I came back to the forums and just realized that lots of people post about RLS and it seems to be a very problematic issue. I never had RLS when I quit Kratom, nor did I have RLS when I quit back in 2017. 

I have no explanation for why, but I’m assuming it might have something to do with the supplements I used to help me quit. I’ll make a list of supplements I used in case anyone wants to try it.

1. Rhodiola Rosea (Gaia herbs brand)

2. SAM-e (Jarrows brand) 

3. Passionflower extract (nature’s answer brand)

4. Agmatine sulfate (nutricost brand)

5. Theanine capsules (suntheanine brand) 


I should also mention that magnesium is said to be very useful in the treatment of RLS, it can be absorbed topically in the form of applying magnesium oil to your legs. Or you can take an Epsom salt bath before bed. Taking it orally may or may not be effective. But I reccomend either magnesium malate or Glycinate, both of these are good forms of magnesium. (Malate is supposedly better for daytime use & Glycinate is supposed to be better to use at night for sleep)

Just...tired.,"After spending 3 months in quarantine, this past Thursday, I was able to to get back to work. I’m a bartender at a restaurant. I was one of the fortunate ones that decided to use the quarantine as the perfect opportunity to kick my kratom habit, and am proud to say that I’ve been free of the demon for the past 69 days. 

I. Am. Exhausted. My body hurts, my mind is tired, and I spend my days laying around recuperating while waiting to go in for my next shift. I’m not going to lie...the though of taking kratom has been sneaking in my head more frequently than I’d like. 

I know this is only temporary to how I’m feeling, after being somewhat inactive for the past 3 months, my body isn’t used to the physical exertion that it’s been going through the past few days. Give me another week, maybe two, and I’ll be back into the swing of things, but I really am feeling rough. 

I haven’t worked sober like this in years. I’m sure thats something that’s also throwing my mind and body out of whack a bit. Possibly the fact that I’m getting older is playing into this as well. 

My apologies if this is coming off as a ramble, but as I said...I’m damn exhausted. Although these thoughts of kratom keep sneaking into my head, I’m staying strong to keep telling them to go fuck themselves. This sub has been such a vital key to my recovery, I feel like a little extra motivation to keep away from my demons would give me the extra push that I need.

I take it twice a day, around 17 capsules per dose, so that probably equals around 17 grams a day, sometimes more, sometimes less, but that's the average. I don't even feel happy when I take it anymore, I just take it to take it and make it seem like it's making me happy. The negative side effects are extreme anxiety, anger/irritability, depressed (not so severe), weight loss, panic attacks, nervousness, peeing more, shaking in the hands, and stress. I also got a new job last year which kind of kickstarted my addiction. I have to work outside all day, I get up at 645 and get home around 530-6 and I get one day off a week most weeks, sometimes I go a week without one, so I think the constant Kratom use while at work and working very day, is really contributing to some of those symptoms. I'm at a loss for what to do, I tried to go cold turkey two weeks ago and lasted two days because my back started killing me because of my job and I had no idea that I did have back pain, at least that severe. So, I really don't know how to approach this, should I just suffer the back pain while I go cold turkey, or do you recommend something else? I tried tapering last week and got down to 14 capsules each dose, but said fuck it one day and now I'm back to 17. I really don't believe in tapering. I turn 21 in 6 days and I have't drank any alcohol since March. When I was drinking, I was doing less Kratom, but I know that's not a good substitute, but at least I was feeling better, shocker right!?

Dumped the remaining 10g's or so that I had this morning but had another order coming in the mail later in the day. Well I received the USPS notice that my package was delivered. Walked down to the mail room, got the package, walked out to the dumpster area and opened up all 3x25gram bags and dumped them one by one. It looks like soooo much stuff and almost dayglow in the sun. Like some kind of teenage mutant ninja turtle powder. just add water. Anyway. I'm sure I won't sleep all that great tonight but I'm not anticipating anything too overwhelming (knock on wood). Nothing that some Kava Kava and 5-10mg THC wont help. But I already have an overwhelming sense of relief. It feels like I just simplified my life by one less complication. One less thing to be anxious about. I'm already starting to feel more like myself. Less detached from the rest of humanity and the rest of the world. 

I knew when I relapsed that I was using this as an escape. It was almost a conscious decision. It totally worked too. I was pretty good at only using it after 5pm. And even when I wasn't taking it, I knew that I always had that option. It knew I always had that escape and it really did make life (and all the shit thats going on right now with COVID) seem more bearable. But I was feeling so much guilt. and so much anxiety, especially at night. And I was waking up with pretty bad depression pretty regularly.

Anyway, thanks for listening. This is a shitty time to have issues with addictions. But I feel like i'd rather deal with the anxiety of living through a pandemic than the added anxiety of living through a pandemic while working on a budding new addiction.

I can very much feel every moment I spent agonizing in silence about how much I hated myself and my kratom addiction. I hated needing it. I hated finding reasons to leave the house by myself so I could get more. I hated chasing the shitty high all day long just to feel no better when I really examined it. The amount of money I was spending on it was fucking insane. I was so moody and unreasonable. I was hopeless. I figured I would have to go to rehab. I did not see a way out. I remember having serious mental breakdowns at work when I would be on day 2 or 3 of a half-hearted quit attempt. So much pain. So much anger. So much despair. God what an awful and poisonous way to feel.

31 days later and I have to say, the toughness of the first two weeks is worth it. This is an ongoing process. Some days are better than others. The bottom line is, I am the person that DOES NOT take Kratom that I spent so much time fantasizing about. If I can do it, you can do it. Life is a lot better today.

Any kind of issue I have, emotional or physical, I no longer attribute to Kratom. I consider this to be normal life now. I just need to learn to deal with the ebb and flow of emotions and circumstance. These things are very fluid and change a lot.

I started taking kratom to kick pain pills from a dental procedure gone horribly wrong. At first it was great because I was really worried about being able to quit taking the pills(every day for 4 weeks), as I have a very addictive personality. The transition was smooth. I was always happy and in a good mood. 
Months passed and there was a point where I actually paid 20$ extra for overnight shipping because I was afraid of not having it the next day. I think deep down that’s when I knew I had a problem. I tried convincing myself that it was like coffee, just a morning ritual and no big deal. Part of me knew relying on something every day to feel good wasn’t a good idea. I went through that already with a 5 yr adderall addiction.

4 days ago, right after I had my morning kratom drink, my partner found an article on kratom being linked to ance and skin problems. That’s when it hit me. For the last 3/4 months I have been constantly struggling with breakouts on my face. All of a sudden my skin looked horrible with painful hard bumps all over my neck and face. I didn’t know what was going on! This was my “ah ha” moment. I had finally figured it out and surely my skin was a good enough reason to quit! 

End of day 3 kratom free! I’m so happy I finally had a reason to quit. I am, however, feeling very lethargic and almost no motivation. My house is dirty and it’s usually spotless. I want to be productive, but I can’t. I’m sneezing way more than normal. It’s hard to fall asleep, but thankfully I’m not feeling any physical pain. Overall feeling pretty low, but thankfully I’m not alone and have a supportive partner. I feel like I have a huge mountain to climb with no energy or motivation to do it. I don’t feel good when my house isn’t clean, and I think that is a huge part of this for me. Does anyone else feel this way? Just trying to take it a step at a time. I tried drinking coffee again, that seems to help a little bit but I feel like I’m just replacing one with another. 

It’s so inspiring to read posts about people feeling so good again once the withdrawals go away! Hopefully I feel it soon. My skin seems to already be improving. 
It feels so good to have a community of people all going through it together. Thank you so much for all of your posts. They are giving me hope and comfort. 

Cheers to sleep (hopefully) and day 4 tomorrow !

I've been exercising almost daily (running & biking), eating healthy, drinking lots of water (and cut back on caffeine too) but the bloating and slow and minuscule bowel movements won't let up.

Everyone talks about having crazy diarrhea after quitting, but that hasn't been my experience at all. I'm a little over two weeks clean, after 2 wk rapid taper.  8-15GPD habit over 2.5yrs. 

I also used laxatives (\~1/2 dose of milk of magnesia) nightly the last 1.5yr on kratom, but haven't used it since quitting. So I am starting to believe this could be a major factor in the linger GI issues.  Just hope I didn't do permanent damage?

I've recently (past 3-4 days) been gulping down lots of prune juice, kiefer and kombucha, along with miralax or now phsilum husks + activated charcoal.  These have helped a little with bloating and allowed me to use the bathroom *usually* twice a day, but results are still mediocre.

However when I first started the hemp (overlapping with taking kratom) I didn’t get dizzy at all, so I’m leaning towards it being the kratom withdrawal effect.

Just wanted to check in and share how it's going for me.  After doing some research and feeling sick and tired of the sweating, I've decided to slow down my taper.  The whole point was to not be miserable and I feel like I've gone too fast since I am still getting so many withdrawal symptoms.  I decided I'm going to just come down 2 grams per week instead of per day.  I think this will be way less suffering. I woke up last night in a pool of sweat again and was super annoyed.

Never really took breaks & was up to 50 to 55 Grams per day. Started taking for back pain & couldn't seem to kick it. I noticed my hair thinning & was worried for my health, so I did a 1 week rapid taper & today was my first day with no Kratom. I feel pretty good & have been able to feel real happiness without having to wonder if it was from the Kratom or not. I have spent way too much $ on the sludge & realize now it wasn't really helping me in any way. I look forward to this new journey in my life & I find a lot of support in these threads, but this is my very first post. I know I can do it! I have quit much harder substances & have quit drinking as well. Wish me luck friends, I have a feeling that I will need it. .•°♡°•..•°♡°•.

Day 2: I felt fine today but last night I def noticed it was much harder to sleep & was laying there for hours. But I took some melatonin & some special candies & finally fell asleep. So far I feel pretty good but this next week may be tough. I am definitely happy I finally just said to myself I'm not going to spend my hard earned money on something that I don't need & something that makes me numb & sick. Just like quitting drinking I want to show my son that he doesn't need any external BS to be happy in life. Just need to rely on myself for feeling good & that its okay to feel bad too.  Feeling more feelings now & trying to be more self aware & appreciate the little things like how beautiful today was spent with my dad,  boyfriend & family for Father's day. This week at work is my last week before having a week off work & my cravings seem to pick up a lot when I get stressed at work. But I'm going to stick to it & Im not going to give up. Hoping my hair will come in nice & thick, as a girl I do not want to put anything in my body that can cause hair loss. I am finding a ton of strength & inspiration in the comments below as well. The community support is great & its very therapeutic to write about this experience & remind myself why I'm quitting Kratom. Thank u all for your positive thoughts.

so I was doing about 3-4g 2-3x a day for around 3 months (before that I did few times a week, then once a day, and sadly kept increasing over few months until I ended up where I was for 3 months).

I stopped CT last Sunday (took my last dose in the morning). I was  extremely lucky to not get so terrible withdrawals, I did not get any physical symptoms (except maybe weird feeling in my muscles, but that was all) and I was able to sleep 7-9h a day.

Also I have decided to stop my nicotine habit with it (I was chewing a pack of nicotine pouches a day).

Only withdrawals I've got were anxiety and maybe a bit of that unreal/detached feeling. I was feeling really anxious and uncomfortable in my chest. It was the worst in the evening the day I've quit and started noticeably improving at day 3/4. Now I feel 95% back to normal, sometimes I get a lingering of anxiety but it usually passes after a few moments. Now it is about managing cravings (witch is really not that hard since I got glimpse of what quitting Kratom after everyday use can feel like)

Kratom is not a Joke I am really grateful for not having as serious withdrawals as many others here. And also, people who dealt with those terrible withdrawals when they can not sleep, are shaky and stuff. They have my admiration and great respect. I mean, the anxiety that I have experieced for few days was pretty bad, not being able to sleep, fuck, that must be nightmare. You guys are really strong! 

Also, I want to tank you guys for this community, it was great reading about other people's experiences and it is good to know how bad stopping Kratom can get. It is great warning that this is drug and maybe despite what many people are saying, it can be abused.",8,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.41637594}"

Read through the pinned threads and such, and they've been quite helpful before (this isn't my first time trying to quit, I have an extremely addictive mindset), so I've decided the downsides outweigh the benefits, so I've decided to give it another shot
Anyway,24 hours since last dose, already feeling a bit gross,but nothing to awful yet of course, however what is concerning is that I've just suddenly decided to have a few drinks (have had severe alcohol issues before, been of the drinks for 2 years now), hoping this doesn't mark the beginning of a pattern
Anyway, just wanted to thank everyone in this subreddit for just existing and for all the wonderful advice, will possibly update if I get to some sorta milestone, just want to wish everyone trying to quit all the best and congratulate all those who have already quit, and to encourage those who want to quit to do so, the risks will outweigh the benefits eventually

I moved to San Diego and can’t get it shipped here as easily, so figured it was time/the perfect opportunity. I was pretty okay the last 8 days, but now a bitch is suffering (it’s me I’m the bitch). 

Depersonalization, anxiety, anhedonia...stomach issues/diarrhea? Not sure if that’s normal? Anyway. I find it absurdly funny I’m finally ending up quitting during a global pandemic, but if not now, when?

So I have been using for over 2 years and average 10-15 OPMS extract shots a day, which I know is a lot and extremely expensive. I have no idea how many grams that is because I could never take enough powder to give the effect of the extract shots.  So last Tuesday I decided to just quit even though I have about 40 unused OPMS shots in my possession. 

Day 1 - Not too bad because I was motivated to quit and had light withdrawals like hot flashes and constant rationalizations to taper instead of cold turkey but I didn't cave.

Day 2 - The hot flashes and sweating started to become nearly unmanageable and cravings to end the pain constantly plagued my brain. I sat around all day and felt sorry for myself and could barely hold any food or liquid in my stomach. Day 2 is when the RLS and insomnia began. I have been sipping Gatorade all day.

Day 3 - I did not sleep a single minute last night and the world feels almost fake. I feel slightly delusional and the same physical withdrawals continue to pound on me physically and I think maybe I'm different physiologically and this withdrawal is actually going to kill me.  I can remember joking about how RLS is some made up problem people use to get drugs until today.  I've had this creeping pain constantly come into my legs and arms which force me to readjust and tighten my muscles, it's incredibly annoying and exhausting.  Day 3 has been a living nightmare and I'm praying that I can sleep through the night.  Gatorade and chicken noodle soup have kept me alive today.

Day 4 - I slept maybe 2 hours total of little 10 to 20 minute increments all night.  I tried a double dose of unisom which did absolutely nothing to help me. However, around mid-afternoon my symptoms appear to be diminishing and I think Im going to make it.  I went outside for the first time and went to the grocery store.  By the time I got back I was totally exhausted and the muscle cramps in my shoulders and legs were beginning to beat me up. I just think that if I can actually sleep a full night I can get through this because I honestly only expected 72 hours of withdrawal and I'd be good. More Gatorade, chicken noodle soup and tiny portion of spaghetti today.

Day 5 - I tried taking melatonin last night and I got maybe 3 hours of sleep.  The restless leg syndrome and body aches are making the insomnia unbearable and I just want to scream aloud in the middle of the night but can't because my wife and son are sleeping so soundly. I'm still getting chills alot on day 5, but the main symptoms I am having now is a lack of appetite, extreme fatigue, diarrhea and depression. It's only 1:30 pm on day 5 so I don't know what the future holds, but one thing I am certain of is that kratom is not going to be in my future.  Anything that makes me go though what I have gone through the past 5 days is evil in my eyes.  Please God let me sleep tonight.

Today I discovered this blog and it has given me some hope.  I know I did a lot of kratom for a long time so this may be a little rougher than normal. I still haven't had the breakthrough I've been waiting for but I am trying to be optimistic that it will come soon and I will actually feel human.  I'm gonna give exercising lightly a shot today, although I truly do not feel up to it.
I'll update this later to fill anyone curious about my recovery.

 Update:
Day 6 - Still only got about 3 hours of sleep last night. I tried over the counter sleep aid and RLS medicine but it didn't do anything. Symptoms are definitely improving, but the overall feeling crappy, demotivated, lack of appetite, RLS and diarrhea still are not fun.  I did manage to do a mile on the treadmill yesterday which was the longest mile ever.  Today I'm gonna have to stay near a bathroom but I'm gonna try and be a bit more active.  If the RLS and insomnia would go away then this would not be too bad to deal with.",29,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7730152}"

[1.5 year user, daily for a year of that, averaged 16G each day] - I recently hit 120 days clean (my first goal) and I figured, to celebrate, I might as well make a post on here and share my experiences!","Warning: I tried to be as detailed as possible in sharing what I experienced on the non-zero chance that someone learns something from what I went through, so this post is a little long. 

Double Warning: I have ADHD, so my writing, on occasion, might meander a bit here or there (though, for the record, I wrote this entire post in only one day... ^^...+ ^^a ^^few ^^others. ^^I ^^am ^^easily ^^distracted.)

There is a Tl:DR at the bottom. 

----

**Background:** Before I quit CT, I used Kratom over the course of the past 1.5 years. It was on and off for half a year, then daily (16g) for the past year. 

~7 years ago, I also used Kratom for around the same length of time. However, I cheated when I went CT then by using Adderal + Xanax daily for a week to try to dodge Week 1 Withdrawals. Thus, I consider this my first ""real"" CT experience. 

For those wondering, my plan of dosing Adderal for a week (and Xanax at night to help sleep) made my first CT pretty easy. My tolerance to those two drugs was zero at the time (more or less 0. Adderal technically has a kind of permanent tolerance that lasts nigh forever even though my last dose was 2+ years prior at the time)

You won't become dependent on either drug in 7 days, even with the slightly above average daily usage I chose. When Day 8 came around, I simply stopped taking said drugs and was fine. The only ""withdrawl"" I went through from either drug was to feel slightly tired for a couple days (Very minor Adderal withdrawals I believe, though it could be from Day 8 Kratom withdrawls.)

Be aware: I consulted a doctor before starting my regimen to ignore week 1 withdrawals. I laid out my master plan (built from information I googled about each drug + my own fallible knowledge) and, to my surprise, he gave me the go-ahead. He also recognized Kratom, *7 years ago*, when it was far less known. This Doc was ahead of his time. 

The man didn't approve of me using drugs for reasons other than why I originally had them (shocking, I know), but told me my planning was solid and should be safe assuming I stick to it (I did), though he was unsure if it would work or not. 


Sidenote: I highly recommend CT over Taper to quit, at least for people that used Kratom as long as I did (1-1.5 years or less)

Why? 

I tried to taper twice and I found that while the negatives I felt weren't as severe as CT, they lasted far longer and eventually made me give up on the taper ~1/3rd-1/2 the way through.

CT sucks a lot more initially, but you get well much sooner. Don't drag out the pain. Just man (or woman) up and accept that life will be rough for a few days. 

Sidenote: 3-4 years+ users might want to consult a doctor before choosing to CT. Maybe you'll have no issues, but at that length of time, your body has grown so used to Kratom, its absence would probably be a real shock. Better safe than sorry. 

---

**My Withdrawal Timeline:** 

---

**Day 0** - I took my last Kratom dose and promised myself I would not touch the substance, setting a 120 days goal before I consider myself truly clean. 

---

**Day 1** - Withdrawls started and they were not that bad, actually. Reddit is full of wimps, this shit is easy (actual sentence I wrote down in my journal on Day 1).

I definitely felt the urge to take Kratom but I didn't experience too many negative effects. (I didn't know this at the time, but it was probably because I had leftover Kratom in my blood from days prior)

**Night 1** - I fell asleep no problem. Things were looking up. How bad could tomorrow really be? 

---

**Day 2** - Pure Hell. 

In bold, 64 font letters, that is what I have written out in my journal. 

That line serves as a succinct description of the *worst* day of Withdrawals for me. 

I took back everything bad I thought about QuittingKratom Redditors. This shit is not easy. The horror stories of quitting are true. 

Honestly, this was one of the most miserable days of my life. 

The reason I say that is solely due to 1 specific withdrawal symptom, of the ones I felt. 

If I had to describe it, it was a feeling of ""offness"" with reality. 

(Sidenote: Due to the fact that I am ignorant of a word to describe this symptom, I have decided to dub it ""The Offness"" for the rest of this post. Any comments that point out the correct terminology will be duly noted and then ignored as I refuse to publically acknowledge my mistake (also, my laziness. Maybe I could have googled to find the name. Maybe not. We'll never know. (I will, however, privately acknowledge my misstep and correct myself going forward, if someone does know a word for this symptom (This far-too-long sidenote (and others like it) is brought to you by: ""ADHD Gang - We always take the scenic route""))))

I can't think of a better way to describe it then as I have. The world around me felt ""wrong."" My mind was thick and slow, it was like I was disconnected from my body and then shoddily reattached back into it. I was still there... but not all of me. 

It fucking sucked. GOD, it sucked. 

I couldn't think straight, I couldn't feel happy, I could do literally nothing productive (had to take a sick day from work, couldn't tough through it like I wanted). 

It might not sound horrible just from its simple description, but let me emphasize: **it fucking sucked.** It's awful. Terrible. Everything felt wrong. 

You can't truly understand what I mean until you experience it yourself. 

**Don't lose hope yet, though, future CT'ers!**

This day sucked but... The Offness was only truly present for a **single** day! By the time Day 3 comes around, it had nearly vanished for me! Yay!

Depending on how long you've used Kratom (and in what amounts each day) plus personal body physiology or some shit, you might not even feel The Offness. If you are one of those lucky people, fuck you man. Or woman. I'm jealous. Honestly, 1 day of The Offness was enough to convince me to never do Kratom again. 

**Night 2** - LOL, I couldn't even dream of sleeping, let alone dream, period. 0 sleep. I laid in bed all night with my eyes closed. That helped a bit. 

Terrible sleep will be a running theme going forward until Day ~8ish, things should normalize around then.  

I wrote the previous sentence down in my journal as a prediction, early on Day 3. When Night 8 comes around, we'll see if my guess was accurate. 

Am I a predictive genius? We will find out shortly :D

---

**Day 3** - Not pure hell. The Offness has almost vanished and what was left was greatly weakened. It was still a pain, but way more bearable. 

Sidenote: If The Offness had stayed at the same strength on Day 3, I 100% was going to quit my CT and try to taper again. It sucked that much. Or maybe I'm a wimp. Fuck that feeling. 

Other withdrawal symptoms I had are what you might expect:

Constantly upset stomach (Kratom messes with digestion, once you're off it, your body takes some time to readjust. That is why you might find yourself burping frequently (a la excess stomach acid))

My head felt thick. It was hard to think (though nothing like Day 2).

My body (mostly my joints and muscles) was sore. I felt stiff and a little unwieldy. Thankfully, this feeling vanished by Day 4 for me. 

Poor appetite. 

Terrible sleep.

Poor internal temperature control. Lots of sweating. 

Restless leg symptom (I actually didn't get this one, but from what I've heard, it's a fairly common symptom. Guess I was lucky). 

THE URGE TO DOSE AHHHH 

(Note: this urge will gradually die off over time. I was able to fight the urge by simply thinking about how Kratom was ruining my life, bit by bit. It was a good motivator)

If Day 2 was a 10 on the ""this fucking sucks"" scale, Day 3 was a 6. Far more bearable, but still bleh. 

(...Heh, that's a decent name for a scale. (Fuck it, we're adding it to future days. (If your pet peeve is minor formatting changes mid-document, I recommend you immediately start building a bridge, that way you can get over your pansy-ass excuse for a pet peeve as soon as possible. (Eh, maybe that last sentence is a bit too harsh... OCD is a real condition right? uhh... back to the Timeline!))))

**Night 3** - An almost repeat of Night 2. Laid in bed all night with my eyes shut. The journal says I got 2 hours of real sleep, so that's an improvement over Night 2's 0 hours. 

---

**Day 4:**

Fucking Sucks Scale: 5 out of 10. (10 = pure hell, 1 = this is fine)

All my symptoms weakened by around 20%. I stopped feeling sore entirely, so that was cool. Nothing else really of note. 

Withdrawals still suck, even when they're weaker. Also, water: it's wet. 

Oh, there was one thing: I really **really** wanted to take some Kratom on this day, according to my journal. 

But I held strong. Go me! My mantra: ""Kratom is a drug, I have an addiction, it is ruining my life, I need to quit. Man up and tough it out.""

(Fun (?) Fact: I typed that mantra out like 200 times (just went back and counted, typed it 107 times... I really had a lot more free time back then. (My guess of 200 was only 93 off... Idk if that's good or bad. (I shall choose to believe good. Go me, again, but this time in French! (on second thought, scrap the French bit. I seem to have vastly overestimated my memory when it comes to highschool French class)))):

**Night 4:**  

Kratom Withdrawls: ""You want to sleep? Sure, just take some Kratom!""

Kratom Withdrawls: ""Oh? You want to sleep *without* using Kratom?""

Kratom Withdrawls: ""Fuck you.""

That about sums up my night. 

I got zero sleep, just laid in bed all night with my eyes shut. This helps a bit (as mentioned previously). 

Why could I sleep on the previous night for a couple hours, but nothing on this night??? 

Idk. Aliens, maybe. Moving on!

---

**Day 5:** 

Fucking Sucks Scale: 4 out of 10. 

Another percentage drop in symptoms, but a smaller one, like... 10%, maybe? Still very noticeable.

Day 5 was a defining day for me. 

While life was still bleh, Day 5 was the first day I really started to feel hope. Not only had I stuck to my guns for 5 days, I also felt like I was past the worst of my immediate symptoms, and those still present were constantly becoming weaker. 

**Night 5:** 

The good news: I slept. 

Praise be! Hallelujah! A miracle! 

The bad (?) news: I only slept 3 hours (the rest of my night was spent sharpening my impression of a blind paraplegic.). 

---

**Day 6:** 

Fucking Sucks Scale: 3.5 out of 10. 

Progress once more! 

All symptoms dropped by... some amount. (I was unable to determine a rough estimate of how I felt, per my journal (how was I determining previous days down to exact percentages? hell if I know. Stop asking questions.). I felt a little *better* but couldn't really quantify that many specifics. Enough to go from a 4 to a 3.5, at least, on the Fucking Sucks Scale.)

One thing I did notice was that the urge to dose Kratom was JUST AS STRONG AS BEFORE, MAYBE STRONGER

LIKE, COME ON, MAN

FUCK THIS DRUG PLANT THING

Also, my appetite began to return a little bit. Yay food. 

**Night 6** 

Slept 4 hours total. It's too bad you can't *will* yourself to sleep. Alas.   

----

**Day 7:** 

Fucking Sucks Scale: 2.5 out of 10. 

Progress. The final day of Week 1 welcomed more improvements on how I felt. 

This was the end of my first ""real"" week of quitting Cold Turkey, and I was ecstatic. By this point, I was *definitely* past the worst of it. 

I began to look at each day not based on how awful I felt, but based on how much better I was feeling. 

There were still a few acute symptoms left, but my head was much clearer, my appetite much stronger. 

Aw, this is cute. I have a little note at the bottom of the entry that states: 

""Life is good again, keep up the good work me.""

Positive reinforcement for the win. 

**Night 7:**

~4 hours of sleep. 

Meh, I'm not going to hold you all in suspense. I am sadly not a predictive genius. My guess that sleeping would go back to normal by Day 8 was wrong. 

I have here that I got ~6.5 hours of sleep on Day 12, (Day 11 was 5 hours, previous days were 3-4). So, Day 12 would be around when I would consider my sleep schedule to return to a semblance of norm.

It took a while for all of my symptoms to die off. I think Day 12, the return of full sleep, would be the day where you truly start feeling pretty ""normal"" again. 

You won't feel 100% normal for a while longer, but this probably varies from person to person. 

Also, I didn't get any PAWS. I'm unsure if a consistent year of daily use (usually around ~16g total each day), and half a year of inconsistent use, is enough to guarantee PAWS. The science of it is beyond me, but suffice to say: Yay to dodging PAWS!

----

And now, the tl:dr for those that came here from the top :)

**Tl:DR** 

How the fuck am I supposed to summarize this long-ass post for you? 

Read the god-damned thing you indolent layabout. Or don't. See if I care. 

(This TL:DR brought to you by: ""Passive Aggressive Gang"", previously known as ""Me throughout High School"")

-----

**TL:DR** ^^deluxe ^^edition

I take back my previous statements, I have a real TL:DR to make. 

**TL:DR** - 3 things. 

1 - CT > Taper (unless you're a 3-4 year+ user... probably. Don't quote me on that. I can only speak of what I've been through). 

Rip the bandaid off and get this shit over with. You have a life to live. 

The best time to quit Kratom was before you started it. The second best time is today (or as soon as you can work a free day or two into your schedule.)

2 - Man the fuck up and don't relapse. You can do it if you believe you can. Kratom is not worth it. The plant is a subtle poison, don't let it chain you down. 

3 - If you want to cheat (wimp (wait, I cheated in my first CT (...moving on!))), in my experience (amazing sample size of 1, I know), you can skip almost all Week 1 Withdrawl symptoms through a regimen of Adderal in the day (it blocked out almost all symptoms for me in my first CT) and Xanax (or certain other benzodiazepines) at night (to help sleep). 

Please consult a doctor to be certain these medicines (and my 1-week plan) is safe for you. There may be other drugs you can substitute if need be. A doctor would probably be able to help you there.  

I would think this ""cheat"" plan of mine should work for most people (unless I'm just super lucky), common things being more common, but that doesn't mean it will work for everyone. You can never be too safe. I reiterate: Don't take drugs without consulting your doctor. Also, if you do take this cheat plan, please make sure you quit *everything* by Day 8. 

I still went through Withdrawl in my cheat CT. I kinda still ""felt"" the symptoms of Kratom Withdrawl. It's just, Adderall overwhelmed all of that and basically let me ignore them. It's hard to put in words. 

I mention my ""cheat"" plan just in case something like this could be the final push someone might need to finally quit Kratom. 

---

**FAQ** 

That's right, I'm predicting what questions I will be frequently asked. Incredible, I know. 

(Sidenote: I just realized... Since I'm already answering the question, doesn't that mean no one will ask it? How, then, can it be a frequently asked question? (Schrodinger's question. (That felt like the right to say, but I'm only a poser, so I'm not sure if it actually makes sense. Anyway. Onward!))))

Some of you might be wondering why I didn't use my cheat plan for my second CT. 

Why, you ask?

Simple. 

I chose to CT raw this time because...

I'm lazy. 

It would be a pain in the ass (10 hours driving total) to go to my other apartment and pick up what I needed. How about no. 

So, yeah, no grand reason or anything impressive like that. Ah well. That's life. Lower your expectations. 

(I could've made up some pretty sounding reasons that make me into half a martyr, but that would be a lie and, as we have learned, I am a man of my word!)

Anyway, that's all.

To all of you who commented on my earlier post, thank you.  I decided to delete it though because I don't want my love life drama on the internet.  But I really do appreciate your support and words of encouragement.

So I started noticing how I am struggling right now with sweets.  So many of you said you have no appetite and lost weight during your taper.  I wish that were me!! I am an addict of everything though and I can transfer my addiction to just about anything.

I made the mistake of buying cookies and chocolate yesterday. Today I actually threw it all out because I feel like I have zero self control right now.  But then it just hit me why I am doing this - DOPAMINE!!  I gave in tonight and went out and got ice cream.  And I realized afterwards I felt so great and I was like WTF?  And then it dawned on me I just had an enormous dopamine rush and that is what I am missing  since cutting my kratom dose down to 1/4 of what it was in 9 days.  

Anyhow, I need this to end soon or I am going to hate myself for gaining weight from quitting this.  I guess I am just curious if anyone else has had these cravings for sugar too.

I used Kratom in small amounts starting about a month after I detoxed. It helped take my mind off of the infrequent booze cravings I'd get. Fast forward to February of this year when I found a place to get krat really cheap, and started buying quarter kilos, then half kilos. Took about half an ounce per day for like 4 months, then slowly moved up to taking over an ounce per day up until today. 

I get withdrawal symptoms not to different from alc w/d every morning when I wake up now, been like this for a few weeks. 

All I can think is ""fuck, I traded one addiction for another."" At least this way I'm not fucking wasted on the drink all the time.

That was too much and it was holding me back somewhat, but I was still doing pretty much everything I needed to in life. I have had some serious issues with my stomach from it, which became unacceptable. 

Kratom helped me a lot with my own unrelated health issues, but it ended up causing more harm than good - I should have had better self control. Yesterday I did suffer some pretty non-trivial withdrawal symptoms which I was not at all expecting.  I'd done this once before because kratom was interacting with an antibiotic I was taking (and giving me vertigo), and I didn't remember having any issues that time.  Still, this has not been too difficult. I think if you have any enjoyment in your life, quitting kratom shouldn't be too hard, even if you're above that 35g threshold (where does that number even come from?).  I would recommend tapering off with white vein kratom, if you're mostly taking green / red as I was (I don't even like the white vein really).",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5341099}"

I quit for 4 months last year and then relapsed but have kept it around 8-10g most days this time. The severity of withdrawals seems to vary a lot with me, but I really got off easy this time. 

I tapered down for one week to 6g per day, using agmatine (500mg 3x day) with essentially no discomfort then quit before a 5 day weekend. I purposely didn't taper sharply because I didn't want to draw it out and lose steam. I used 6mg etizolam, only for sleep, spread out over the past 6 days. 1.5mg the first night, then progressively less by day until finished. Also kept taking agmatine after I stopped kratom. 

There were times where I felt anxious, tense, or lethargic more than I would otherwise, but it's like I nearly skipped all the usual symptoms (RLS, hot/cold, sweating, heavy fatigue, back pain). It was mild enough that a mild cold would have been more unpleasant. Slept no problem the first four days. The past couple days as I tapered off the etizolam, my sleep has not been good but my energy levels are manageable. I woke up at 5:00 am today and I am not a morning person, though it's also been very hot at night where I live and I hadn't set up the AC until just now. 

I've been around the block so I know it could take another couple weeks for my sleep to be close to baseline and even longer for the brain fog to fully lift, but I'm already living life normally and so grateful. The subpar sleeps are always the worst part for me, so there might still be some tough days to come, but I feel like I can handle it. I have hardly had cravings at all and haven't even relied on weed or anything else to catch a buzz. Coming from someone who's been addicted to like 6 different drugs before, that's not normal for me. I think I'm finally just bored with the repetitive and restricted life pattern enough to start to let go (I'll probably always have some pull towards drugs though after so many years of this). 

I used agmatine last quit (but no taper, jumped at 16g) and it wasn't this easy but it still helped a lot then too, so that's my top supplement to recommend to others. Having a small amount of benzos just for the first few days to sleep at night also made it so much easier to get through. Of course they are addictive themselves so they might not be a good option for everyone. I purposefully only got enough for what I need so I don't have extras around. 

Now's the time to start trying to rearrange my life so I'm happier and less stressed so I don't relapse on something else again. I'm pretty humble and know that relapse is not out of the cards for me, so I'm just focusing on how I can live better so I don't need to escape to cope with life.

First of all thanks to everyone active in this sub. I have a (not that bad) history of some substance abuse, and these recovery subs are the best that has ever happened to me.

I used to take Kratom multiple times a day, most of it 2-3g. At it's peak I took 6g multiple times. 
Until some heart issues appeared. I got minor palpitations (the first time I got them I got a panic attack believing I have a stroke. That was a hard time for sure.), unsteady heart rate and a slight, but always distracting chest pain in the location of my heart.

I already have this for 2 weeks, and I just got myself an appointment at a cardiologist, but it's only now that I understood that the whole thing is Kratom related. When I googled ""kratom heart"" I got many many posts about exactly this issue.

I have successfully quit smoking weed this year, it’s been 4 months and 3.5 weeks since I last took any THC. My dumbass immediately replaced it with kratom, and have become reliant on it for my job in sales. I have some time off now, and I’m planning to go on a road trip. 


I was just wondering if anyone has done anything like that before? (Going our in nature to make quitting less unpleasant). 



How did it go? The thing I’m most worried about is sleep. I’ve been taking the opms gold concentrate tablets, and honestly I kind of suspect that there’s not just kratom in there.

Kratom is the one that has given me the most problems. 

I jumped off 60-80gpd habit last night, but I use a series of meds because I'm a pussy and a junky. The meds I use is adderall (gets rid of everything usually), gabapentin at night, ambien on day 5, and try to get off of everything within a week. 

Kratom is so inconsistent. There are times where I knew there were opioids added, no doubt. Especially the head shop shit. But the adderall gets rid of everything during the day (still sucks ass), and the gabapentin at night- Well, I started sneezing even on the addies, which never happens. I have gooseflesh, even with the addies. This stuff never happened before. But it really doesn't matter to me. 

Kratom caused so many problems, from attitude and short temper, to drastic weight loss (20lbs from 150). I look like a crackhead. 

I lifted and did cardio today, but started sneezing like crazy right now. I hope this kratom is short acting or takes a shorter time to detox from, but I won't count on it. I know how this goes- Just strange how different each withdrawal actually is...

Keep going folks. This shit has to stop- I can't do this anymore, but once 2 weeks hits, I started fiending like crazy. This time, Im going to go 5 days on meds, tapering rapidly, then join some sort of sober group, work on my physical health, and start to plan my escape from addictions. 

Just so sick of it, mid 30's and terribly unhealthy and unhappy. This is going to be a bad one. Usually, I relapse for 2weeks to a month, then kick. This time, 6 months straight at huge doses.

So I am praying I can try and make it through today with just another 2 grams and shorten up my taper plan by  quitting 3 days ahead of schedule.  As of today I am trying to not take it until I start sweating and sneezing.  I started sneezing today about 5 hours after my last dose.  I did make it all last night though from 745pm - 430am without any.  I woke up sweating profusely, but that's still exciting I made it all through the night sleeping.  I am getting pretty happy to be done with this junk.

Also, I have an exciting report!  So my resting heart rate has already started to drop significantly.  Last night it was 44 bpm.  As I stated before a week or so ago it was 57 which is crazy high for me.  This means the taper is working and I am coming back to life!  Yay!

I found a new group of bad ass runners to join this Saturday so it's motivating me to get this taper over with and get kill my workouts again.  The thought of my health returning is really exciting because I guess I didn't realize how detrimental this was originally.  I honestly don't know if it is or not, but it certainly seems to be the case.  Anything that makes you feel invincible and creates a surplus of dopamine has to be draining other parts of your system to achieve this effect.  What do I know, but simply a guess.

I was  heavy into painkillers 4 years ago, experienced vicodin and oxy withdrawals up the ass, I used to take about 40-50 pills a day of 10mgs, then moved to 4 pills of 30mg oxys. Terrible withdrawals, flu like symptoms, body aches etc all the usual. 

A few years later moved out of my home state to another ( not to get away from drugs but that was a huge bonus) and began life again with a clean slate. I started noticing how much clearer my mind was and how much more fulfilling a drug free lifestyle is. Then I learned about Kratom and how easily accessible it is here. So I started experimenting, found a few good strains and I loved it, I felt enhanced, I felt happier, work became fun and i just kept telling myself ""Its natural, can't be anywhere near as bad as an actual pill"" while in the back of my mind the voice of reason whispered to me about how I'm slowly forming an addiction.... dose and ignored. Fast forward a month later, I started noticing things like inability to focus when reading, depression, and I was now taking Kratom because I was scared of WD, as soon as I felt a slight body ache, dose, runny nose? dose, boredom? dose. 

The voice of reason became louder, ""STOP, I know you are seeing these negatives, and you need to stop"" It was just last night, I got home, dosed and began to play video games (my fav thing to do when taking opiates) I noticed I wasn't enjoying it anymore, I noticed a loss of joy for my favorite hobby, I actually just became angry, no euphoria, nothing, instead I wanted to lay in bed at 9PM.... NINE PM.....""What the fuck? Im done"" It was like a switch, the voice of reason completely took over, I no longer ignored the negatives, I outlined them very well, I could see clear all the ways it was affecting me badly. I'm a month in to using and afraid of tapering (barely any self control) but I'm ready to fucking quit. The most I've experienced from Kratom WD is body aches and fatigue but that's only one day of not dosing. I'm afraid of how it will affect me and my work in the coming days....

Her support helps me and I do not want to disappoint her. I also have a great job and we both make good money. Life is suppose to great for me.

About 6 years ago I discovered I had some bad back and neck issues. I have bad Scoliosis, stenosis of the spine, herniated disc and started some disc degeneration. I was prescribed hydrocondone 5-325. I took them for about a month on and off and no issues. Then about a year later I had crazy pain. I did not sleep for 2 weeks and was hallucinating. They put me back on hydro along with other meds. I took my pills as prescribed and thought I was fine because I was doing what I was told by my doctor. Then after about 2 years of taking my pills everyday, I decided to stop because the pain was not that bad. I then got really sick and realized that I was dependent. I did quit cold turkey and stopped using for about 3 months. I then heard about this safe plant and started taking Kratom for about 6 months. After 6 months I stopped Kratom and had no ill effects. I shortly thereafter found Kratom shots. I started taking those for about 2 1/2 years. I was taking on average 3 of those a day. I figured they were safer than pills to help manage the pain. After a while I knew they were a problem and I got sick of spending the money on them and I knew I was addicted to them. I did not get high from them, but I needed them to feel “normal”. 

I quit the Kratom shots 40 days ago CT. I went through hell for about 10 days. I had all the symptoms. RLS throughout my whole body, insomnia, heart palpitations, crazy anxiety, headache, GI issues etc.. 

Days 11-25 got a little better. I still had no motivation and nothing interests me. Sleep improved by day 18 and was sleeping on and off for about 5 hours a night. By day 26 I was sleeping about 6 hours and now I am at 7 to 8 hours, but it’s not great. 

Days 26-40 the anxiety gets a little better everyday and so do the GI issues. I never really had depression. Still not much gets me excited. I am still a little tired and get headaches. However; it is manageable. I have zero cravings for kratom, but the pain die to my issues have me craving the Hydro. I have not taken any. 

Lastly, about the kratom shots. I found out that they had about 12 grams of kratom, but they also apparently had 500mg of Phenibut. Please be careful when taking stuff and definitely know what you are taking. Just because you can get them easily, does not mean they are safe.

I'm going to ask for gabapentin. This fixes the fish flopping and RLS and helps insomnia?

Do I also need to ask about colonidine? 

The gabapentin is the big one correct?

Can anyone comment? Can anyone comment on quitting with and without the meds? How much do they help? Do they both help or can I just do one? I've seen some mention kolonopin but I don't think I want to suggest that?

My taper didn't go as well as I wanted. I drastically reduced but am stuck in the same place as as mixture of withdrawal and will power. I'm going to CT with the meds. I want to know what I am in for before I do anything and do something stupid (at work or whatever).

Thanks. I know I have posted a bit on here asking similar questions. I'm a 43 yearbold professor so I do homework. It's what I do. I used to drink so I know when I get over the hump to not let this happen again.

Today was kinda rough in a weird way. In my pre jump/early WD stages, I would read about people describing PAWS in or around where I'm at currently, and they're much different than what I was anticipating. The lethargy, sight irritability and brain fog are so... Weird. It's like everything is surreal, and it usually hits midday in waves and subsides in the evening. It's honestly not horrible, but it's not great and everything is just bleh. Some days it doesn't even happen at all, but when it does I keep myself busy by exercising, going places and playing video games. I've also been taking cold showers and eating healthy, which does wonders. It's no longer to keep myself from wanting to use, it's mostly just to get through the shlump at this point. I can honestly say I have absolute zero desire to use again. Cravings only come rarely from certain triggers and last at most a minute, but even then, there's still no true desire. I have had the want to do other drugs, but I'm an addict and I know where that leads and I'm enjoying full sobriety right now. Apart from all that though, I'm stoked for the future and I can honestly say I feel better than I have in years. Anyways, that's my rant on it for the evening. Hope you're all doing well and staying strong out there, and for those of you in the early stages of withdrawal or tapering, you have so many blessings and potential waiting for you on the other side.

My last Kratom run lasted about 3 years and was taking around 50-75 GPD capsules.  So I was choking down over 100 pills everyday for a long time.  The withdrawal was pretty bad.  It lasted for about a month.  The best way to describe it was an opiate withdrawal cut in half but lasted 2 to 3 times as long.  I was clean for about 3 months and then relapsed about 3 months ago.  

For me, its ALWAYS when times get tough, I just want to do drugs to make whatever it is, easier.  I know that this always backfires.  It just creates more suffering in the long run.  So here we go again.  Kratom gives me this little euphoric feeling with lots of energy.  Ive been using it so long that I have a hard time getting motivated in life and doing things without it.  I just want to stop and conquer boredom and ""the hard"" things in life without drugs.  I find this site to be helpful knowing that I am not alone in the suffering.

I would normally take about 4 grams of red bali once maybe every other or third day. During quarantine I upped that to two doses of 4 grams daily because what the hell else is there to do, that second dose sometimes right before sleep. Maybe the sleep dose was 5 grams. Makes a nice opiaty haze while I go in and out of sleep and semi watch YouTube.

Now suddenly I can't sleep without it, I have to fidget constantly, flex my leg muscles to get rid of a bizarre discomfort that I think is what people here call RLS. Argh! It's not exactly painful but it's so damn persistent. And now I'm out of NyQuil too. 

Anyway, wondering if this is common even at the dosages I was taking?

I hate to do it but I might have a teaspoon of k just to mellow this out. Ugh.

The reason I decided to quit was because I started feeling awful withdrawal symptoms between my doses, like in the morning, or hours after my first dose.  It was mainly awful anxiety and sweaty palms and feet.

One of the things that REALLY helped me I believe, is that I was REALLY looking forward to quitting.  I had prepared ahead of time, ordering all the vitamins and supplements I’ve read about (Definitely went overboard doing this, will be returning many of the supplements), bought some CBD and some Kava...GOOD KAVA, which I want to mention.

I hope it doesn’t break any sourcing violations that Reddit has, but KavaFx worked AMAZINGLY for me...Usually fatigue and lethargy are bad in the first 4 days and so far I’ve only experienced minimal fatigue.  Usually anxiety is awful, but has been easily manageable.  I’m only two days in so I’m being cautiously optimistic.  I really feel good, moments of very minimal depression (I’m going to try ginseng for that), but that’s it.  

I’ve read other posts swearing by this product, medication, vitamin, supplements, etc...But for me KavaFx has worked wonders for me.  I just wanted to share in case any of you are looking for a high quality product.

I know another poster in the past added that Kava simply masks the anxiety that comes with Kratom withdrawal, and that very well may be true.  But it feels like to me personally, getting off Kava seems like much of “smoother landing”.  However, once I stop taking Kava, the anxiety could comeback like gang busters.  I really don’t feel like that’ll happen, but if it does I’ll deal with it when the time comes.  I’ll keep you updated!  Thanks everyone! (KavaFx.com)

And last night was the first night I experienced RSL I haven't ever gotten that with any opiate withdrawals and it SUCKS. Insomnia has begun now too, I am hot and cold (mostly cold). The chills are so much worse than with oxy. I haven't eaten in a couple of days and since everything is coming out in liquid form I suspect I shouldn't.

I started taking kratom around 2 years ago after going through a bit of a tough time and it was great and I still love how it can make me feel nothing has ever come close from a supplement standpoint. I dnt drink as much as I used to and feel it has given me many mental benifits.

But I cant ignore the negatives anymore they are stating to outweigh the positives. At first everything was good then after having no issues all my life i started to get constipated occasionally, no probs eh? Well that has turned into most of the time now also ED is a big problem now another thing I never struggled with before. 

I was putting up with that and considered it a trade off and managed it with certain ""strategies"" but now my sleep is being effected, in recent months I'm.takkng it upon waking and in the last few days I'm walking up earlier and earlier and when I do I'm finding it impossible to get back to sleep because of restless arms (another thing that I've never had issue with). I know it's my body craving a dose and the next step is waking up in middle of night and having a dose to get back to sleep.

I like alot about kratom but I cant bullshit myself and need to handle it but I'm not sure what to do, try and cut down?? Can I honestly stick to that? Even  if I do I'm not sure what level I would need to get too in order for everything to be ok that i mentioned and even then I'm not going to be getting any Ben's in terms of effects so the only logical thing i can come up with is to quit all together.

Shame because I do like alot about it.

Any advice on quitting/tapering/cutting down would be great and and definitively something to help with withdrawal and particularly restless arms at night would be great as I'm sure I'm in for a couple of weeks of no sleep if I just went cold Turkey or maybe even if I cut down because I'm.getting it now even as I'm taking it.

But if I can do this so can you guys. 
Lingering withdrawals:
-heart palpitations 
-fatigue 
-depression?
The reason I (?) after depression is because I’ve always been depressed and quitting has made it much much worse. I get bursts of “OK life is all right this isnt awful” to full blown “life sucks what’s the point” and go back and forth often. 
Fatigue is still rough. No focus, brain fog. Tired. Never able to roll out of bed and get chores done. This may be being intensified from the nicotine withdrawls but I am not sure. 
Heart palpitations have been nonstop since the very first 12 hours of withdrawal from Kratom. They were every minute of every day but now they are once every hour or so they are slowing down big-time! 

Guys! You can do this! I was a four year user and about 21gpd some times more. Believe me, than morning Kratom dose got my day GOING. But give this time. Let your body heal. This has not been easy. But can we really expect it to be, anyway? Withdrawals & addiction are HELL. (For real, day 3 no nicotine and thinking about saying fuck it all, but not going to!) Kratom wasn’t easy to quit.

It’s really the little things like this that makes sobriety so much nicer compared to when I was choking down dozens and dozens of caps throughout the day. 

I have to admit though, I did have a one day slip up, but I don’t feel like it was enough of a slip to push all the great process I’ve made back. It helped remind me how much I truly didn’t enjoy life as much while I was dosed out all the time. It reminded me how much better I am NOT taking a substance to control how much or how little I feel. I have quit way more than a few times, and it reminded me of how much I’d rather stay off this stuff rather than stay on. If anything, I’d say that my slip up really helped put things in perspective of me. 

Life has been good to me for the most part since I’ve quit, and I want to keep it that way. I live in paradise with a great man by my side, a job I enjoy and have met some awesome people. Every once in a while, that dumb little voice will pop up and say “Hey, wanna know how to feel even BETTER?!”, but I’ve learned how to push that voice to the side.

Have been able to be free from opiates for 5-6 years. However kratom which I discovered in 2010 has been a 10 year battle. Always minimizing it and eventually really trying hard to get off of it with varying degrees of effort. I go to meetings regularly and they help but it seems nothing has been able to quell the craving that eventually comes. 
I find myself here for what seems like the millionth and one time. My kratom usage for the past 2 years has been sporadic at best and never more than 3 days in a row. Its like I really really don’t wna go back but I’m settled on mediocrity and some relief. I can make it anywhere from 7-21 days and then the “perfect” excuse or reason to buy K always seems to appear. 
Im on day number 2 and have already been creating reasons in my mind why I can do this a few more times while I’m 28 but never when I’m 29. What’s funny is looking back I said the same thing when I was turning 28. Which leads me to believe that this is a revolving door. So long as you feed the stray cat it will never really leave. 

I go into this week with an intense amount of deja vu. Just feels like I’ve been here before and even though I really don’t want that lifestyle anymore part of me is still unsure I can break the cycle.

I didn't think it'd been that long, but I just looked at my email history and my first online purchase (from Zion herbals/ini botanicals) was 4/15/15. 

I used it for back pain. I was a heavy diesel mechanic for 8 years and my lower back is TORN UP.  So to save myself (and my liver and stomach) from taking Tylenol, Ibuprofen, and hydrocodone, I started taking it. Well, the feeling was great, I loved how productive it made me feel because I didn't hurt at all. 

 I started with kratom in the morning before work. I would take 2 teaspoons, then a tablespoon, then a heaping tablespoon. After about 2 years, I started with kratom in my morning shake, and either 2-3 hydrocodone or another dose of kratom when I got home.

 Over the last two years, I went nuts with the kratom, at my height I was taking 60 grams per day. I was taking some every four hours. I started taking it to deal with stress, anxiety, anything I could think of. I was also taking ""recreational doses"" of hydrocodone up to 140mg at a time. That was towards the middle/end of 2019. Every time I've stopped buying kratom, I've started taking hydrocodone again.

 I've tapered down to one dose of about a tablespoon in the morning (still don't have a gram scale after all these years) and man, FUCK the restless legs. I can't sleep worth a shit, my stomach hasn't been normal in weeks, and I hurt so god-damned bad in the afternoon/night I can barely walk. It'd be so easy just to start taking it at night again too. 

I guess this isn't really a cry for help, as much of a rant/bitch session for me. This fucking sucks and I hate it but I don't want to go back. I want to quit everything. I've already quit drinking for the most part cause I got tired of feeling like shit and being bloated. The taste of kratom makes me gag like hell and its come right back up after taking more than a few times, but with everything compounded I just can't seem to give it up for good.",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5256491}"

I want to share what made the difference this time around.","Let me preface this by saying I’m not going to be talking about how to handle physical withdrawal. I just want to touch on dealing with the cravings and coming to terms with removing kratom from my life, because that has been the most difficult part for me in previous attempts.

I was hopelessly addicted to kratom for over 5 years... there really wasn’t a waking moment that didn’t involve thinking about my next dose. No matter how much I wanted to quit, kratom had such a strong hold on me that I could have every intention of quitting (and I can handle physical withdrawal relatively fine), but 24-48 hours without kratom would amount to psychological torture and I would always cave. But I just hit 20 days, and cravings have been both minimal and really easy to overcome this time around. I have no desire to return to kratom whatsoever.

Someone here recommended me the book Unbroken Brain: A Revolutionary New Way of Understanding Addiction by Maia Szalavitz, and it was truly a game changer. She does an amazing job at explaining why we get addicted in the first place, how addiction changes your brain, and why we become consumed by cravings despite wanting to quit. I feel like having a complete understanding of what was happening to me made it SO much easier to fight through cravings when they came. If you search her name on YouTube, she’s done a few Big Think segment that I would recommend as a primer. You can find a used copy of the book for $5-$6. I haven’t been a big reader since my addiction started, but I literally could not put the book down. I really can’t recommend it enough.

The other thing that’s made a huge difference is scheduling out my days down to the hour and sticking to it as much as I can. I schedule everything from meals to hobby time to the 3 walks I take every day. I try not to spend more than 1 hour at a time on any 1 thing. This makes me feel busier than I actually am, provides much needed structure, and stops the day from feeling like it’s dragging on and on. This is exactly what they do at any rehab/recovery facility, and it works.

Last but not least, pick 3-5 activities that the old, not addicted version of you would have enjoyed and schedule time for those too. For the first few weeks, you’re not going to want to do any of them— the reward centers of your brain are all out of wack, and kratom will be the only thing that your brain will convince you that you’re up for (even above food!). When it comes time to do them, DO THEM! I promise that once you actually start doing the activity, you will enjoy it. Your brain is just incapable of being excited about sitting down and starting it. This really allowed me to slowly let go of the notion that life isn’t enjoyable without dumping sludge down my throat and it slowly helps that dopamine get up and running again for something that isn’t kratom.

My activities are: adult coloring books, video games (Breath of the Wild), reading, and learning to cook new dishes that I’ve never made before. 

The worst mistake I made in my previous attempts was just quitting and hoping “this will be the time I can get over my cravings”. Addressing the mental aspect of addiction and quitting is infinitely more important than worrying about what supplements you need to mitigate the physical symptoms of withdrawal. I hope this helps someone as much as it helped me.",149,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.49636525}"

Between now and then I spent around 80K … $80,000 on kratom, maybe more. Complete insanity - I could have had my own house somewhere!

Anyways - I told myself every day would be my last day for over a year and honestly, towards the end I truly thought that maybe, I would never be able to actually stop taking this shit. I mean every day I woke up and told myself ""okay, today will be the last day"" .. I got so damn sick of hearing myself say that. It was a literal nightmare and I was a complete slave to this nasty ass shit. 

I spent my last dollars on it. I constantly borrowed money from whoever I could just to get one more. It was a never ending cycle of being in debt and owing money. A prison I trapped myself in so desperate to escape. Towards the end, I'd wake up and it was like another force was taking over my body going to get the crap. I was miserable. 

Well 33 days since my last OPMS shot .. 32 days clean and I'm free. I know it's early but I'm not a prisoner, a slave to kratom anymore. I don't wake up thinking about it. I don't obsess about where the next smoke shop is, how I'll get there, when I'll be able to take it. It is not controlling my life anymore. 

32 days clean and I was able to buy a car yesterday. Fuck, ALL that money would have gone to kratom. What makes me cringe is that I had to finance a car that I could've paid for in cash with the money I spent on kratom in the last 6 months alone. But that thinking wont do me any good. I bought a car! I'm not a slave to something that took everything from me and turned me into a pathetic version of myself.

Fucked my self up good doing a relapse.,"I was clean from kratom and oxies for like 8 months but some bad stuff happened 2 weeks ago so I relapsed. Wd this time is worse than the first time. What is going on?? I used to take 30gs a day the same as I took when I relapsed. Was only taking 30gs a day for like a week til I ran out then I was like well I guess that’s it. I went CT both times. 

Days 1-3 were like constant agonizing pain radiating thru every bone in my body. I’d just writhe in pain. I had a horrific migraine. the worst I’ve ever had. I Couldn’t eat and I couldn’t sleep at all for those day. I got mad hot flashes too. 

Days 4-5 i felt better during the day time but at night for 4+5 I felt like my body was on fire I was sooooo hot. Brain fog. Hot and cold. Aching but nowhere near as bad as the first days. I dont have any energy and I’m really irritated and enraged for no reason and have been taking it out on my family and friends which then makes me feel so bad about myself that I just sob. 

Day 6.  I’m pissed that I’m not through acute wd yet. Im so fucking hot all the tine. My body hurts but not too bad. I’ve been able to do the laundry and finally eat something. I wish this would just end already. I thought I’d be done by day 6. I feel like im gonna be hot and sweaty, angry and sad forever. I’m so pissed I did this shit to myself again. This time is Soooooo much worse than the first time I quit CT. I Feel like im going through REAL opiate wd.

I have made it from 40 - 18 grams today.  The first few days were rough, but I feel like I am leveling out now and it's not as bad as the first few days.  I'm only dropping 2 grams a day now so I'm hoping it won't be horribly bad for the rest of this.

I am really cranky as hell though and I am really depressed.  My knees have been hurting a lot so I took today off from working out. I think exercising tomorrow should help me feel better I hope.

I can't get over how strong this drug is and how much it sucks to quit.  I cannot do this again.  I won't.

This is only my second time quitting and luckily I only took it 4 months the first time and it will be 90 days on it this time.  I am glad I didn't allow myself to stay on it longer than this. I think the main thing that got to me was the fact it quit working so fast and I had to keep taking more or rotating strains.  But also the fact I had to lie and hide it from everyone just makes me feel like shit.  I went on a date a few weeks ago and all I wanted to do was go home so I could get my next dose.  That made me sad.  Well, and the fact that I feel like I am super hostile on this crap.  

Anyhow, I am so grateful for this community because it helps me realize that what I'm going through right now is simply the withdrawal period and I know it will get better once it's all said and done. I hate that i have to drag it out so long, but I just don't want to be miserable like I was when I did it cold turkey. 

I'm going to try and post every day for this month as a way to stay accountable and not relapse.

It's been years since I posted here. It's because I got clean, and when you're clean, people tend to move on with their life instead of writing here. It's when they recognise/admit they're addicted, that they go to these helpful communities.

Anyway, I wanted to share with everyone how I managed to quit relatively easy, all by having a plan: A realistic taper schedule. It included somewhat higher doses around weekends to socialize (keep distracted and value life again how it is) - maybe like +0.8gr of my current dose, ofcourse nothing crazy to mess up your tolerance level again. For people that live for their work you can do it during the week, but make sure to ofcourse not include the whole working week. You get the point, be realistic. If you taper to fast, it's not going to work. Especially if you have a lot of stuff going on in your life.

I was dependend on 50 grams/day, lowered it by 0.1 everyday. At first it looked like forever, but apart from the withdrawals otherwise the kratom wasn't doing any noticeable damage to my body thankfully. After 1.5 years I was clean, and the only withdrawals I got was ofcourse in the morning, waking up at normal hours (that even fixed my bad sleeping schedule!) and sometimes a running nose.

Because I was using so much, I made sure to spread it out in even more but smaller doses, so it would be a smooth line. Ofcourse that would still take a lot of kratom to consume, but I could afford it thankfully and it wasn't worth the withdrawals.

To everyone out there, I'd recommend not tapering to fast, because it's unrealistic, and makes people prone to relapses. You don't need to go as slow as I did - maybe you want to be clean by a specific date or event - but make a plan. Good luck to everyone out there that fell for the kratom trap!",8,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.47763318}"

Just wanted to share some insight from this morning with a quick background to give it clarity:

Due to stress and hanging out at this kava bar all the time, I started vaping nicotine that was salt and essentially as strong as JUULs for the past couple weeks, like one pod’s worth a day. Drinking too much kava, and not even bothering to measure my kratom intake anymore (I imagine it was consistently 20-25gpd with random 50ish binge days). I was not in a good spot.

Well, on Friday, I decided to lock myself in my bedroom essentially and quit nicotine cold turkey, and quit or lower my kratom intake. It sucked, but I ended up taking 10 gpd all in the evening to help sleep (still RLS like mad though 🙁). I was essentially a vegetable this weekend.

Today, I woke up with a good amount of clarity, more than I have had in the past two weeks. This morning, I felt great. But in the past 30 mins, I’m not quite feeling as well. But I will not go over my current daily dosage, and plan to lower that once I have a better foundation in place with exercise, life practice, medication, and counseling to help me through.

It is not a linear journey. It is unpredictable. Stay strong, and know that your reward is coming. I suspended my disbelief this entire weekend, but I much prefer where I’m at now than the hell that was last week even before the quit.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44619584}"

I have no issues falling to sleep and the sleep pattern of waking up within 4-5 hours and then falling back to sleep for around another 2 hours within 10-30 minutes (usually aided by deep breathing and meditation) has been my sleep pattern for about 3 years.

I've been through alcohol and cocaine/amphetamine (to a lesser degree) withdrawal/treatment in the past so I'm no stranger to negative chemical dependence symptoms.  I tried going cold Turkey from the 20 gpd level about 5 weeks ago and the withdrawal effects just increased steadily for 4 days so I returned to the weaning effort. Regarding nicotine, I was considering using nicotine gum as a crutch.  The plan is to rotate, Kratom, Niccorette and Cold Turkey every 3 days while simultaneously reducing my dosage levels of each.

Couldn't stay away from this stuff. Saw it in like every gas station and convenience store i went to it seems like. Temptation everywhere. I got tired of hiding it from my wife. Making a mess at work doing toss and wash. It was giving me really bad skin problems. It's tough but you have to keep moving as much as you can during the acute. Didn't sleep but a couple hours in the first 4 days of CT. It's really not worth it. Dosing 4 times a day for just a mild warmth feeling that lasted like an hour. I've started to exercise to get the endorphins going during PAWS. The furthest I got previously was 26 days clean and I would just home thinking about how depressed and anxious. Everything in saying pretty much everybody else says that been though quitting. Still have bad days but the good outnumber the bad. In my experience days 3-7 are the worst. After that you can feel yourself start to turn a corner. To everybody else early in your journey. Stay with it. It's worth it. I was hopelessly addicted if I can do it anybody can.

It was all fine, i knew that i have addiction problem but still it was helping me. But few days ago, i had a seizure. I dont remember anything, just my parents calling me ambulance. I took kinda normal dose of kratom from new vendor( but i consumed almost all before it) and i had that seizure. When i was at hospital, after EEG and CT tests, they told me that i have something like medium epileptic activity in my brain, which i dont really know what doest it mean. because i had to quit cold turkey for few days, i feel like a fkin shit and its getting worse and worse.

I use kratom as little as possible, max 5 grams a day, and never use it on the weekends. I've quit large amounts of kratom before, accidentally got back into it around 4 or 5 months ago, and realized immediately where it was heading. I've been trying to quit since then, but I work a very strenuous job, and can't take days off. Every weekend I don't take any with the hope of being good enough to go to work on monday. Other times i've called off hoping to get a little more time. My attendance for work is getting questionable now and I feel like i'm stuck permanently in withdrawal. It's very mild, and if I could take a week off, i'm 100% sure I could power through it, but the stress of work keeps me coming back.  


It's really frustrating. Every day I take a few doses to get through the day at work, get home and feel miserable until it's bed time, and then take a half gram before bed so I can sleep properly. This is one of those aforementioned weekends right now. I'm feeling ok. Not great. I'm on my third day of feeling mildly crappy. It's bearable for sure but i'm not starting to feel better yet. What i'm asking is, do you think I should risk my job and just go to work sick and probably get nothing done? Or should I keep this cycle up until I can take a week off or something (probably a few months from now). So far, it's already been a few months and i've kept my dose exactly the same. Never more than 5 grams a day. Always the bare minimum to get through the day and sleep. I don't think it could last much more than 4 or 5 days, but i'm worried. My first time quitting kratom was a year ago, from 80gpd or so. I have experience with quitting opiates so I knew what to expect, and it was mild compared to opiates, but still very painful. It lasted around 3 weeks until I felt normal physically. Another month until mentally. 2nd time I quit was a very small (3 days) binge of extracts, and it was 3 or 4 days before I felt fully normal. I'm really hoping this situation is only 4 days or so as well, because that would mean i'm almost there. It is a small enough amount that I think this could be the case, but the reality is, I have no experience with quitting such a small amount, for a relatively short period of time. Do you think i'm through it and should just go to work feeling crappy tomorrow? Or should I stay with maintaining, try to taper and get some time off eventually? If i lose my job i'm fucked, because I have nobody who can support me while I look for another one.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6899399}"

I've made a few friends on here and was honest with one last night about how shit was going and he was like ""dont fucking do it"" and I was like ""I won't unless I have rls (arms) and dont sleep again""... I kind of feel like I fucked up, but at the same time slept from 3:30 to 8:30 this morning.

This is by far the worst WD process I have been through,  and although I don't mind my visual cortex going nuts, I became very concerned about the delusions that have followed if that were to come like times I used speed excessively in the past. 

I know there are very many different opinions here and infinite options as far as paths go and whatnot, but I really didn't want this. I will say this,  if I had insurance, I would totally have been like ""doc, hit me with some klonopin so I stop seeing shit please"" and she would be like ""did you smoke a joint first?"" And I would have been like ""to no avail...""
More likely than not. Lol, but she is busy and I cant pay her at this point, so I fucked up to whatever extent. I did try calling last week, but didn't get a call back, probably because I usually just text her.... maybe should have done that. I'll do that now to see what she actually says. Wow, writing and reflecting.... jesus.

So I feel way better this morning and have a little rls, but not much yet, having been up and about for 2.5 hours,  last dose at 3am. Plan to use .5g again tonight an hour or so after rls sets in instead of 5 hours after, and seeing how that goes, then decrease dose to .25 g and see if that cuts it the next night.

Little black shadow spider-ants are not wondering on the walls yet, and that is pretty sweet.  I really hope my sensitivity to lack of sleep is atypical and others dont get where I have been, but I figure documenting it and outlining my actions, be they a failure or success on my staying stopped journey may help someone down the road.

Withdrawal cure,"My Kratom withdrawals are the most hellish experiences on earth and I felt like there's nothing in this world that would make it better. After not sleeping for 2 days, laying on the floor with a hellish RLS around my body I found a cure and in 10 mins I was perfectly fine. Mother in law sends us teas and urbs that we just don't use and store in a drawer. So I started taking everything around the house out of desperation.  I found this dried flower, didn't know what it was and made a really strong brew out of it. Waited until it was cold enough to drink and chugged it, Within 10 mins all my symptoms were gone. I swear to god, I treat it as a miracle in my life.  


So the flower is called Calendula, I don't know what brand or supplier I had it from but it worked and I seriously believe that it can work on opioid withdrawals as well.  


There a couple of things you need to be careful with. It will lower your heart rate so start slow. It does affect some opioid receptors in your brain and that's why it helps. 1 strong cup lasted me 10 hours before I had another one. It won't put you to sleep. But it will take the load and RLS away completely. So get your self a KG of quality calendula and try. I hope it will help a lot of you. Brew the flower parts as strong as you can and start sipping. It really hopes it helps  


The only negative side is that it made the comedown so pleasant that it went back to kratom. Not only it takes you pain away but it gives you this groovy chilled feeling. If you feel your heart is slowing down stop and sip throughout the day

I’m 34 very healthy and fit and I loved the energy it gave me and how it took away the nerves when I would be around other people drinking. It was great for a while but the last two months I started experiencing horrible anxiety and panic attacks especially while driving. I used to get them when I was drinking all of the time so it really freaked me out that it was happening all over again. I noticed I didn’t want to leave my home anymore and was missing the gym that I always loved so much. My husband finally asked me whats going on with you? I had to come clean and tell him the truth that I had a problem and was scared. He seems to not think it’s that big of a deal.  He said well if it’s a plant from a health food store how bad can it be?? Kinda like I did when I first started but I want my life back. I have two boys who need their momma to be fully present and functioning. I tapered down over the last two days and then I just said fuck it last night and I am on hour 17 right now.

I easily had the best day so far since quitting kratom.

I have to give credit to somebody on this sub who mentioned that they did not take kratom in the morning because the first thing that they would do is lace up their shoes and go for a run.

That is their routine, probably long in place before they started taking kratom.

My routine was to wake up drink some Kratom and coffee then wait for it to settle in and start working.

16 days ago I had stopped taking kratom in the morning, but I would still have a craving for it first thing.

However, today was different. Today was different because of the comment of the other subredditor. It made me think.

I usually lift weights in the afternoon, at about 4 p.m. but after reading that comment I realized I had a choice, I had a chance to completely disrupt my morning routine, and I took it. 

I decided to lift weights. Not heavy, but enough for my body to feel it and to completely put my mind at a different place.

The effect was twofold.
1. The endorphins and adrenaline brought out by the weight lifting help to fill that neurological craving.
2. The behavior gave me something else to do and to focus on besides the craving, it filled a void.

I can't emphasize strongly enough how important this is. Understand your rituals. Understand your associations with use. Find a way to disrupt them.

I really do strongly recommend weight training, or resistance training because it has a very specific effect on your body and brain as well as your endocrine system.

I am on day 3 of my taper and feeling really proud of myself for sticking to my plan.  The first day was pretty bad because I dropped from 40 grams the day before to 24.  I was a hot mess.  Plus, I am now sticking with my white strain only as I gobbled up the yellow and green strains I had left on the day I did 40.  

I'm feeling way better today though.  I also biked 43 miles, ran 3.2 miles, and did a hot yoga class so I think that helped a bunch.  

Hoping this will be an easy breeze this time around since I am not going cold turkey like I did the last time.  My kratom free date is June 25th (my 1 year sobriety date).  I am so determined to enter year two of sobriety COMPLETELY sober meaning kratom free as it's the only drug I've had during this entire year of sobriety.  

Anyhow, I am relieved to not be dying the way I was previously during my withdrawals.

The suboxone helps for 48 hours, then I need to take it again. I know I need to be careful to not get hooked on suboxone and took my last one yesterday morning. I’m expecting tomorrow will be difficult. I’m on a ton of supplements.

I’ve been reading articles about how magic mushrooms can help with ptsd and addiction. Im going to take some and find out.

When I take the suboxone...I get a glimpse of what normal life was before Kratom. And I want that so bad. There is no reason for me to take Kratom. It’s just my brain wondering where the extra dopamine kick is and torturing me produce it. 

Some days I wonder why I even wanted to quit. I thought of how even though I took Kratom, I was still functioning, responsible, a great father and husband, getting things done. I tell myself, what if this is what i need to be great...is that so bad to take it everyday?

But it’s a lie...I’ve never needed it. I’ve always been great. I don’t want to have to rely on something to feel good anymore. It’s ok to feel shitty. It’s honest, real, and raw and ok to feel like shit once and awhile. And I’ll be free..all suffering is temporary...the only meaning to life, is the meaning we make and I don’t want Kratom to be apart of that meaning anymore.

I’m going to finish this one and my goal is to give it a year. If after a year I still want to take Kratom then I’ll consider it but I’m ready to put this behind me. 

Taper has been relative easy so far. Usually I just cut my lunch time dose right away but I made a spread sheet this time for my taper. It’s approximately 70 days stopping at .5 gram/day at one morning dose then I’ll evaluate whether I want to try going lower or every other day.

Been on kratom for about 3 years now. I did quit at one point, but at the time I was on large amounts of morphine and I would take kratom when I couldn't get my morphine. Or simply take kratom at work so I wasn't strung out and nodding like I would have been on morphine. I quit for probably a month after being in detox and rehab. The rehab was absolutely horrible, but I did try to make the best out of it. I left rehab early, my parents supported my decision and gave me a place to stay so they could keep an eye on me. I had made it back to my old job in framing after I got out of rehab. And even though I had been off of everything for a few weeks, the lethargy was horrible. Swinging a hammer feeling like that really sucked. So I used my addict mindset and went back and bought kratom. Now here I am still taking this green sludge years later. Well I toss and wash, so I guess I can't call it sludge. A while ago I started a taper and was doing pretty good. Then I stopped my taper, but at least I stayed right at 20 grams per day. After corona and everything happened I am now finishing 500 grams in literally 5-6 days. Probably taking around 100 grams per day give or take, and I've been on this shit for years. Some people get mellow withdrawal while mine is absolutely horrible even with the smaller amounts. I've tried to Cold Turkey when I was at about 30 grams per day and I didn't sleep AT ALL. I had made it about 3-4 days I believe. Tapering did the same for me, I got literally no sleep. Luckily now I take Seroquel for sleep and it usually does help, but sometimes it doesn't work at all. Not only does my sleep get fucked up, I literally feel like I want to kill myself coming off this shit. Thats the reason I stopped my cold turkey in the first place. This is coming from a person whos been on Heroin, Morphine, Suboxone and experimented with many other opiates as well. For me kratom is the worst. I have a feeling it's because I already have some bad mental stuff going on with depression and horrible social anxiety. I already hate myself in the first place. And I know that kratom greatly effects seratonin levels. Then theres also the fact that my muscles and everything just do not seem to work at all during withdrawal, I feel like a fucking slug. I would sit down on my couch and literally just fall in to the couch while cold turkying because I didn't have the muscles to sit myself down. It was day 3 at that point if you guys are wandering. Is there anyone out there who experiences horrible withdrawal from kratom like I do, not getting sleep for weeks at a time? I'm on several quitting kratom groups on facebook. I've always known there was a reddit on quitting kratom so I figured I'd give this a shot now. I'm fucking up my life. Yea, I work and pay the bills. I have a beautiful girlfriend and my own place in Southern California. But I've got some demons in me that I need to fix. I'm beginning to ruin my relationship as well as my life. I can't go back to rehab because it didn't really help worth a shit, the detox did though. If I don't fix this soon I will probably end up dead and I'm not saying end up dead from kratom toxicity.

As a matter of fact I would say I feel more positive feelings surrounding my abstinence than the negative thoughts of using again.

I turn 30 in a few days and I'm so glad I won't be doing so still harboring this secret pain. 2.5+ years of heavy use(50gpd+ & an extract shot). At times I thought the only way out was gonna be kill myself or treatment. I was dropping so much money. I was sneaking around. Lying to the faces of the people that only want the best for me. 

Fortunately all it took was some will power, opportunity, and putting my hand out for help and being painfully honest with my loved ones. Also, I was just done. I was sick and fucking tired of chasing it man. That feeling is actually spilling over and making me examine other habits and my behaviors in general which I think is reassuring that my mind has really committed to getting better.

Blocked nostril all night, runny nose, sneezing etc.. Can't really tell what are WD's and allergies. All i'm asking for right now is some sleep, but that will have to wait i guess.

Day 7 and it feels as if my body is doing it's best to get me back on K. Trying diffrent strategies.. One day feeling kind of good, ""you're over WD:s now, see, not bad you could continue using"" to the next day being super crappy, ""you know what would make your life easier?""..

However I am curious to know if anyone else experienced similar health issues as me during my time using (wich was a big reason quitting this time).

The following happend after having Kratom > Eating/drinking (tea, coffee,):

Blurred vision, Heart palpitations, feeling dizzy (almost as if to pass out) for about 90 minutes. Since i have not been visiting the hospital for a check up I have no clue what could be wrong, but i'm sure whatever it might be/been, Kratom made it worse. It was not nessecarily a high dose of K, but always in combination with food/drinks. This happend more and more frequently the last days of my usage, 3-4 times a week. Has anyone had similar experiences?

Problem is I still have about 2/3 a bottle left.  I know I could just throw away the remaining kratom, but I know I’m not going to do that.  Thankfully, I take 22 GPM (two 11 gram doses twice a day) so I take 16 capsules for one dose and 32 capsules for the day (674 mg per capsule).  I’ve done the math and know Monday night will be my final dose.  

I’ve been through all the different types of withdrawal (opiates, benzos, amphetamines, weed, and actually kratom a couple of times in the past).  Opiates were by far the worst withdrawals.  I know people joke about withdrawal from weed, but honestly for me it’s tougher....nothing too bad though.  

Anyways, it’s just a weird feeling waiting for the withdrawals to begin.  Thankfully early next week I don’t have too much going on so I’ll have a couple of days to get through the worst.  Just like everyone else, it’s not the initial withdrawal I dread (we’ll, I do dread that too) but it’s the lingering anxiety and sometimes depression that can last awhile.  

I’ve already got some CBD, Kava, “Calms Forte”, and Valerian Root ready as well as some Gabapentin.  If anyone else has any recommendations I’m all ears, but I know you just have to go through it and there is no magic supplement help everything.

The one thing I haven’t done in the past that I REALLY hope I’ll do this time is exercise.  I know it’s easy to say now (after I just took my evening dose) that I’ll exercise the first few days of w/d, but in reality I know that I’m really going to have to force myself to do so.  I’ve heard doing short sprints helps a lot?  Any truth to that?  Or is it basically, sweat as much as you can?  

Anyways, sorry for rambling but I’ll appreciate any comments or suggestions on what helps you when you’re going through withdrawal.

In and out of rehab etc... Kratom became legal in my state once again, so I took the chance a bolted to it. I came off of shooting 2 8mg Suboxone a day cold turkey with the Kratom,. In the beginning I took 3 grams twice a day. I still withdrew from the subs for 24 days straight, that sucked. Kratom was definitely that crutch for me, but I can't act like it didn't save my life. I just had a doctor visit in which they took blood samples and confirmed I have no diseases, and that my liver is surprisingly normal, no damage. I admit, I'm the luckiest person alive. I have to be. Anyways, not here to boast, I'm here for your support and answers. I have been taking Kratom for 8 months now, same brand, same strain, 3x a day. I have been using a fork (I chose a fork, because a spoon was a definite trigger for me in the beginning) and just scooping out of my bag. I knew it was time to start getting off of the Kratom, so I grabbed an old scale of mine, and started doing my normal thing and weighing it out just to see what I've been taking. I couldn't believe it but I take 3-3.5 grams each dose.  I thought I was taking a whole lot more! I didn't take it for two days, and on that second day, I quickly realized I was withdrawing. I can't sit and say it was as bad as the Suboxone withdraws, but really, what withdraws are easy? Honestly, they were really minute symptoms, but that depression smacked me in the back of the head, and I quickly got that overwhelming feeling of oh no, here I go again. If you've withdrawn from anything ever, you understand what I mean. Anyway, I'll be 8 months clean (in my eyes) on the 22nd. That's a big thing for me. I'm ready to get to where I need nothing at all to get through the day. It's time to get off of this stuff and complete the cycle once and for all. I'm planning on taking 3 grams 2x a day for 7 days to get a good baseline started, and adjusted. I then plan on dropping by .5 every 7 days until it's over and I'm at 0.

I was also getting pretty intense cardio as often as work & school allowed me to. Over time I reduced my intake from roughly 30-35 GPD down to about 12-15 GPD, and was able to just stop taking it one day with few (if any) withdrawals. I want to believe that my body is just resilient, but how likely is it that the drugs & exercise made it so easy to jump off at the GPD that I was at? I've since quit taking phenibut and don't have the Adderall connection that I used to, so at most, the only thing I could do similarly is try to get that exercise. But the phenibut was what was making the exercise so easy/rewarding.

I tapered off of phenibut, but I know I could never taper off of kratom. It's just too easy to say ""I'll start tomorrow"" with this shit, since I dose 3-4 times a day. So it would be nice to try the same thing I did last time.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4740764}"

So sorry I did not get back to my last post, but I've been somewhat a hot mess with this crap.  I am SO EXCITED to quit tomorrow and be done with this junk!  

For motivational purposes, I found our quit date angel number and thought I'd share it. So far there is 3 of us who have decided to quit CT tomorrow and hoping more of you will jump on the wagon with us.  I want this crap out of my body for good!

Here's our number sign..

### ANGEL NUMBER 611

Number 611 is a compilation of the energies of number 6 and the vibrations and attributes of number 1 appearing twice, amplifying its influences and resonating with the Master Number 11. [Number 6](http://numerology-thenumbersandtheirmeanings.blogspot.com/2011/05/number-6.html) relates to home and family, domesticity, business and material aspects, service to others and selflessness, [**grace**](http://universalspirituallaws.blogspot.com/2010/09/spiritual-law-of-grace.html) and [**gratitude**](http://universalspirituallaws.blogspot.com.au/2010/09/spiritual-law-of-gratitude.html), responsibility and reliability, providing for the self and others, care and nurturing, problem-solving and solution-finding.

**Physical Dependency**  
There is a physical dependency here. if you don't go cold turkey, as many others have said, it takes WAY longer. like months longer.

Going cold turkey, it took about 5 days for the acutes to subside. around 3 weeks for the elevated anxiety and restlessness to decrease, and around 5 weeks for the sleeplessness to subside. Facts.

**Mental Dependency**

When I was on K, the best part about it is no matter how hungry, tired or shitty I felt - or how frequent shitty things happened, I had something to take (potentially a lot of!) to instantly change my mood. Having had other substance issues that were less passive (adderall/alcohol) or illegal, this was the holy grail - allowed me to work and be a normal human being (within society) while still being a drug addict.

When you come off of it, you have to be more restrictive with your life - can't sleep as little, can't be as hungover, can't be as in debt - you have to make safer decision. You have to **prevent** bad situations from happening - which is a good thing, but it changes your life substantially. Especially when you have to avoid things like alcohol/food/caffeine that first month (because you end up overdoing it and not having the health or mechanism to cope)  


On the other hand, you also have to learn to sit with bad feelings - gradually this becomes easier and you can just feel crappy for a few hours without having to take something. You learn to do your daily life (get food, eat, work) gradually again - even when you're not 100%. 

And what you realize is you needing to take Kratom or anything to do things was in your head. You don't.  


* **Notes on Quitting**
   * Come off cold turkey. idc how much you take - have someone to monitor you. and take a few days off - for sure. no pressure to perform (including relationally) is big.
   * try to socialize - makes the depressive aspects bigger.
   * try to change other things -where you live, habits - helps combat the negativity and anchor the changes permanently. gives you positivity - and makes you feel better.
   * Life feels virtually the same as before (meaning as when i was on kratom) at this point (7 weeks) BUT
      * I dont need to worry about taking something.
      *

I have jumped from one substance to another for somewhere around 20 years, (im 35) Kratom for about 4 years. So im not expecting to feel great for awhile, but I'm grateful for the times I feel ok. 

I've read you need about a month per year you've been using to feel better, so if i need 20 months to begin to feel normal, I guess I am getting what I deserve. Hoping things look up soon. Im positive about it, compared to a couple months back I was so depressed I didn't want to live.

As the title says, today is day 60 of my new life free from kratom (and opioids as well for that matter) but it’s also my 3 year anniversary of no gambling. 

I feel incredible. My mental clarity and level of physical exercise is something I have not known for years. Going through the process of getting off kratom was very challenging (and I did a rapid taper compared to CT) but it was a brutal experience. However, I know that I can face anything. In fact, the experience has brought me confidence and trust in myself that I lacked for so long. The fear of withdrawal paralyzed me and held me hostage, when in actuality I know now that it (all the discomfort) was so worth it. It really was like going through a rebirth in so many ways. I’m only 60 days out.  I’m not getting ahead of myself, and I learned the importance of that in my recovery from gambling. It truly is one day at a time, and trust me it makes things so much easier to embrace it that way.  I know that many of us look at the future all at once—- that’s overwhelming! 

If you’re struggling right now with kratom, I promise
you that the day-by-day approach will work if you just embrace it and don’t look ahead. Just get through today. I’ve gotten through 60 of those “todays” without kratom and I smile now when I see that guy in the mirror. I can look him in the eye and he can keep eye contact.

After everytime Ive stopped I always got back on after a few months thinking ""what's the harm?"". This time I realized the harm was that kratom may have been either giving me intense anxiety and fear or exacerbating latent psychosis. I thought it was the wellbutrin I've been taking since February because whenever I'd increase dosages I'd have the most issues but then I realized kratom might have actually been the straw that broke the camel's back. That brings me to 5 days CT from Kratom and 5 back on my meds (after consulting my doctor). To be honest the anxiety and depression of withdrawal and anxiety of stabilizing my wellbutrin is pretty terrible as I write this. The terrifying sleep paralysis I had last night didnt help.

First off I really just want to thank you all, I have been a lurker on this sub since day 1 and every post has truly helped me and my resolve. This is my second rodeo - I have had a >60gpd habit for about 9 years, my first quit was 4 years ago and I lasted the best of a year but I went through a life change and ultimately ended up back on the sludge. Now, I have an amazing fiance and we both are eager to start a family soon so it was definitely time to kick it for good this time.

I have a lot I'd like to say but I feel its likely all been said before so instead, I'd like to share some songs that have genuinely helped me get through this hellish ride.

First off, for the addict in all of us - 

""It Gets Easier"" by Jason Isbell. I am a longterm fan of his and this track on his newest album really hit home with me. During the first few days of WD any sleep that I could muster (which wasn't much) was plagued by dreams about kratom and Isbell talks about it in the track. *side note* ""Be Afraid"" on this album is my current morning song and has also helped plenty.

""Locked Down"" by Dr John. This has a personal connection for me but it has stood out as a track that I can stick on my headphones, feel that groove and feel alive finally. Made me strut down to the shops full of confidence after having a panic attack about going to buy a pint of milk!!

""Fight Like A Brave"" -by the Red Hot Chilli Peppers. I have totally rediscovered my love of RHCP for the first time since being a teenager during this CT and this song in particular has helped immensely to remind myself that, like you, I am a fucking warrior. You and me have walked through hell with no expectation of an end date and are persevering against all odds. How many people in your life do you know that could fight what you have been fighting? Remember this when you feel those awful shameful feelings, you are stronger than most. Truly.

 jump on this sub for a while and lay in bed and eventually to either do some Wim HOF breathing, or go for a brisk walk around the block to get the blood moving, then I shower.

In the morning I opt for drink green tea (for the L-theanine) instead of coffee because I need that hit of caffiene but I don't want anxiety.  

My supplements are still blackseed oil, ashwaganda, gaba mainly

Trying to get in with my massage therapist today, so I can drop my MAT dose tomorrow. It's already super low. I'm also considering IV therapy. They have clinics where they give you magnesium IV. I'm thinking that would chill out my muscles maybe and this headache. They also have a detoxifying one called Myers cocktail that gives b vitamins, mag, and a few others. That is the one the clinic recommended. I'm hoping to get into both of these today and maybe tomorrow I will feel human again.

Some WD effects like depression and constipation look like antidepressant side effects; both while being on antidepressants and coming off them.

Kratom may be affecting serotonin similarly to antidepressants. I haven't taken antidepressants but from what I understand they are not meant to be stopped CT, they titrate AKA taper, for a variety of reasons. One that is, IMO, important to consider is that CT may be too abrupt a disruption to your system, eliciting all kinds depression, anxiety, sadness etc...

I think I've wrapped up my acute WD (nothing cute about it haha🤪) but the anxiety and depression response was serious.

I know many people have had wonderful results with CT, and ultimately we all have to jump, but for those who are looking to quit definitely consider your options between taper, CT and letting a physician know.

I went rapid taper then jumped. We'll see if it sticks. I think it will, but I'm no stranger to falling off.

I have seen many people say that they feel worthless. Maybe suicidal. Please know that this plant, our predisposition, our personal situation, rest or lack thereof, our country's and world's circumstances are all working together to seriously bang us up.

You are not worthless. You're struggling. You're strong enough and that strength means that you will endure. You will endure sadness, craving, pain and everything else this world feels it needs to throw at you.

I've been doing Kratom for a couple years now, the first year being primarily the powdered Malaysion Kratom (1 oz bag would last me 1 week). I gradually began to take the OPMS extracts, and at my worst, I was taking those 3x a day everyday for a few months. 

I quit back in January, and I made it about a month or more before I got overly confident and decided I'd do it again ""here and there"". Needless to say, months later and I'm back to 2x a day. 

Besides health, the reasons I want to quit: 1, I go back to work at the office on June 22nd after working from home due to Coronavirus. I know even if i quit today, I'd still be feeling shitty by the time the 22nd comes around, but at least I could have a head start. 2nd reason is simply that I want to enjoy my summer; here in New York, we hibernate all year until finally we have permission to enjoy ourselves in the few warm months before we cycle back into the cold. How much of a shame would it be to ruin the summer? I know much of it will be spent in WDs and just all around ""not feeling quite right"", but hopefully if this is similar to the WDs timetable from my last quit, ill have some of the summer to enjoy.

I just feel like everything in my life is wrong, like I made a wrong turn somewhere and live in this alternate upside down world. Wish me luck guys. It really is true, t hat the biggest thing holding people back from quitting is fear.

He never pressured me but it was hard to resist since there was a steady supply in the house. That year I took off was truly amazing, I accomplished so much in life, and was able to deal with my anxiety and insomnia quite well. 

I've been tapering the past week after starting to get panic attacks and tightness/pain in my chest when taking kratom. I know that I'm happier and more motivated in life when not taking kratom everyday. With corona going on, I'm not able to work my job so I've just been at home these past months. I realized that now would be the perfect time to quit because I dont see my work coming back for at least another few months. I'll be able to go through withdrawals without the stress of work, and hope to take this time to better myself and improve my lifestyle. I'm now down to 5 grams a day from 20-30 a day.

It's giving me an itchy rash all over.  I am very confident the rash is from kratom because every time I take extra it flares up and itches and burns.  This gives me anxiety and forces me back on to a taper.  It's fucking up my blood pressure.  In the peak of my use I went to an urgent care for an infection and my blood pressure was really elevated and I remember what I felt like.  I often feel like that now like my BP is too high.

I'm starting to worry about my liver now too as I'm realizing this stuff has considerable toxicity.  I'm only 32 I need to take this seriously because I don't want to end up with vascular problems.  Or liver issues.

Long story short, I’ve been off-and-on with kratom for about 2 years, but it’s been the worst and most constant over the last 8-9 months (relapsed at the end of August). I started a taper about 3 weeks ago. I was at probably 50-70 GPD (wasn’t really counting) to start and now I’m down to 16-19 GPD, so this has been a pretty fast taper.

It’s seems to me that there are two major things to deal with in quitting:

1. The mental/physical pain from withdrawal
2. The desire to take kratom because you like the way it feels or whatever you think it does for you (cravings basically)

I’ve managed number 1 pretty well, hence the success of my taper so far, but lately I’ve been really struggling with the cravings part. When I start feeling shitty or unmotivated, I get those cravings for the kratom high and the dopamine that comes with it, and I wind up screwing up some doses.

I want to try another big jump in my taper soon (down to ~10 GPD), but my difficulty dealing with the cravings is getting in the way. Some days lately I’ve crept closer to 20 GPD because I justify these slightly-bigger doses that I crave for; this is not good because I should be at ~15 GPD with my current tapering schedule.

Any advice on what I’m dealing with here?

I was addicted to Kratom for about three years, on and off. Countless times quitting and then relapsing, never more than two months at a time off. At my highest I was probably around 40-50gpd. 

Two and a half months ago I quit CT. Since then I have been strenuously applying myself to recovery. Daily, intense exercise, strict diet, meditation, and daily NA meetings. I’ve been journaling, doing step work, I’ve been meeting with a therapist. I’ve been completely sober apart from very occasional kava use. 

The last two weeks have been really, really difficult. Pretty much every day I wake up tired, depressed, and anhedonic. I feel myself drifting away from life, and it’s harder and harder to manufacture any enthusiasm, even for the things that I know I normally enjoy. There are a lot of things about my life right now that are objectively so, so much better than when I was addicted to Kratom - I’ve made a ton of progress even just in two months. But I can’t seem to get any existential satisfaction out of any of these things. 

My question for people with serious time under their belt is this - is this normal, and I just have to take life on life’s terms and deal with it forever? Or did any of you pass through a period like this early-ish in your recovery? 

One more thing I’ve been thinking about a lot is that I was pretty unhappy with my life before I ever used Kratom - it’s one of the reasons it hooked me so hard. Is there anyone out there that ended up going on antidepressants after quitting Kratom? I know the general wisdom is to wait a long time (6 months plus) after quitting before trying anything, and I do not want to go against that advice. I’m just curious as to whether anyone found relief from the stuff they were struggling with that pushed them to Kratom.

But what's the point of managing my pain with kratom if the addiction to it makes me miserable anyways? 

It's like the shittiest band aid for pain, doesn't actually treat anything, just makes you temporarily forget about it. You need to take higher amounts because your tolerance builds and the analgesic effects decrease, so all of the other negative effects of kratom are amplified. I'd rather be in pain than be a pain free zombie addict.

Also: Any opioid addiction actually decreases your pain tolerance. So you end up experiencing more pain than you would otherwise, unless you constantly medicate with more opioids.

I've started physical therapy again and it's 500 times more helpful for my pain than kratom ever was.

High as hell on dope the second time. Flash forward to 2018 after my month of jail and I screwed up with the hard stuff quickly again and got scared and found kratom after I left suboxone clinic cause the stuff constipated my bladder (worse feeling ever btw) and have kept it at that for almost 2 years. I'm a high functioning addict (not bragging at all)  During quarantine I've been using kratom heavily but running 5-8 miles every other day, eating high protein low meat diet. Amazing what one can do when you dont work and still get paid. Then last wednesday this crazy fevor took me over, intense skeletal muscle pain, chills sweat the whole nine. I still dont know what it was for sure. But my best friend (successful straight shooter, gave up anything partying years ago) came at me aggressively over what I now know was his pent up frustration with my kratom use. He insists it was a bad reaction to the kratom He sometimes eluded to the negative info he read and I always brushed it off as negative propaganda. Yes I was one of those until today. I tried calling a college friend not associated with our friend group to rant and he caught me off guard by having the same info and negative thoughts on the substance and further berated me.  He was the one who directed me to this subreddit. And I have to say my jaw is dropped. I consider myself intelligent and I'm blown away at all the negative effects everyone has experienced on here that I have been nlindly not equating at all to my kratom use.  I currently go thru 8 ounces of powder in about 9 days.  Sometimes less time though.  The hairless info hit me the most. I have to admit I'm quite vain with my appearance and for once I guess that's a good thing. Unfortunatly I had a huge blow up with my best friend and words were said  before I came around and he isnt responding to me. I need to quit cause I need my friends.

My stuff doesn't get lab-tested so I'm not entirely sure what's in it and I'm dosing by the heaping spoonful. I shouldn't be surprised- I go overboard with just about every substance that numbs pain to a detrimental end. 

I have chronic pain issues and kratom has been absolutely wonderful in helping me tolerate my daily pain. Well mj is legal in my state now and I hit up the dispensary and got some microdosing thc pills so I'm going to give them a try. Mj is the only mind-altering substance I've had that I never had an issue of going overboard with, for some reason. When I was younger I could work while high but now that I'm a manager I just can't. I have too many responsibilities and too many people who need me to remain in my right mind to get things done. I've had one of these pills and it is just *chef's kiss* for being just the right amount of pain relief without messing with my mind, so I am excited about starting this new journey in pain relief.

All that being said, now's the time to get to my question. I have fibromyalgia, and one of the symptoms is an overactive GI tract. Like, EXTREMELY overactive. Kratom solved that problem for me. I won't get into that too much as I'm sure you can pick up what I'm laying down. This is the one thing I'm most worried about. I've been through wds for some substances that messed me up, and tolerance breaks from kratom just brought me an overall uneasy feeling and a bit of exhaustion. Totally tolerable.

Have gone CT a total of 3 times in 2020 and made it ~72h, ~7d, and currently 47d and counting.

I don't want to discourage anyone who is currently suffering through acute withdrawal (as I'm about to mention things do get a lot better very quickly), but I wanted to provide some insight on why I think so many people seem to fail during the first month even after getting over the worst of it and why people with months clean say it takes months to recover.

My experience with withdrawal (insofar) goes...

1. A weekend of hellish acute physical symptoms and extreme emotions.

2. A week of irritable despondent apathy and inability to focus on anything.

3. A week of insomnia and no energy.

4. Weeks of residual mental issues and random periods of assorted physical symptoms that become less and less frequent/intense.

So it's definitely a lengthy process, but what's striking is how hard it is to see that without some objectivity from being beyond it.  While going through it each milestone seemed to feel like I was ""out of the woods"" or ""pretty much back to normal now.""  It was true in the sense that things were certainly improving, but I couldn't recognize (perhaps the length of use here is relevant) that it was actually still having quite an effect and I was not yet in that great a place.

Comparing how I felt one week to the week before it was easy and amazing to see how much better I felt, but mistaking that for the norm leads to questioning how dull and uncomfortable sober life actually is.  With this mindset it is no wonder people relapse after getting through the worst; they think they're through it all and unconsciously give up hope or let down their guard.

As I said I'm on day 47.  I'm sure posts of mine from around day 30 will say how I feel good pretty much all the time now.  Yet today I still somehow manage to feel miles better practically all the time compared to the best times a week ago.

When I quit for 72h I would have said most of withdrawal is over by then and you can function with lingering symptoms after a weekend of hell.

When I quit for 7 days I would have said most of withdrawal is over by then and you can function with lingering symptoms after 72h of physical pain plus another week to get over the worst of the anhedonic apathy.

Now I recognize it's more than that.  Hell I'm not even sure if I'm truly back yet or if I'll be making another post like this in another month.  I know people convincing themselves they feel good enough to use sparingly and responsibly is a thing around this point.

I believe I originally dismissed people saying it took months to recover because it seemed like such a daunting task, and I still think it's much more important for people in the thick of it to instead focus on the fact that every few days or so they'll see a remarkable improvement.  It's just as important though to balance those victories with a reminder that there are still a lot more to look forward to.  Feeling down in the dumps during your second week after a pink cloud on day 7, or feeling tired after back to back nights of difficulty sleeping around day 20, are not indicative of what life will continue to be like and you need to remain committed and vigilant for the long haul.

I vividly remember reading posts on here during my first week and hating myself whenever I saw anyone who was farther along than I was.  Now seeing people struggling in the early stages is a big help to remind myself that I don't ever want to be back there.  If you're in the worst of it now feel free to ignore this post and focus on taking it one hour at a time.  Just push through and you'll be feeling so much better in what'll very soon seem like no time at all.  Once you reach that point though I hope you remember this and can buckle in for the insidious endurance leg of the race.  Treat advice from those with a week or two under their belt as encouragement but not gospel.  There are far too many accounts on here who post daily, declare some sort of victory, and then disappear all in the span of a couple weeks.

Whether you win or lose the battle, railing against an enemy who makes you sob and shake is trivial.  It's a whole other war to continually resist an enemy who you aren't even sure is there anymore.  Listen to those who are further along than I am who have the hindsight to know that it is.

tldr: Most people feel significantly better after a week or two.  Don't confuse this new **relatively** good with ""back to normal"" and let down your guard.  Normal keeps on feeling even better as the weeks turns into months.",25,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46644333}"

So on April 8th of this year I quit CT (10-20 GPD for 1.5 years) after a very, very drastic taper. It was absolute hell but I was also off work for those 2 weeks. I made it 2 weeks until life got stressful like it always does and I caved. 

I started taking those dreaded Sleepwalker shots 1-3 times per day starting around April 10th and have been taking them every since. I learned that the phenibut is now not in them so I ordered some Phenibut HCL online and I am trying to start a taper.

However, I just ran out of K. Ever since my relapse I’ve been taking about 4-8 GPD (so for about a month and a half). How bad are the WD’s going to be and am I totally screwed with the phenibut also?

Just writing this post to get my thoughts out of my head.

Sometime in April, I decided to do a long slow taper after failing CT quits three times previously. I felt really good about my taper for many weeks, and I got from 15-20 gpd down to 7gpd. However, a few weeks ago I went on a camping trip and made the mistake of bringing a whole bag of kratom and a scale rather than perfectly weighed out doses for each day. While at home, I would weigh out doses individually each time I took kratom, even during my taper, but something about being in a different environment with someone I hadn't seen in a while, made me sorta stop caring about my taper while I was camping. I also didn't get back on track with my taper when I got home after my trip.

Flashforward two weeks to right now and I am taking 9-10 gpd, occasionally more and not really keeping track of my dosing. Part of the reason I am making this post is because browsing and commenting on this subreddit was huge motivation during my taper, and I think I need this sub as a resource so I can start tapering again.

All in all, I am just really upset that I wasted these 3 weeks, not tapering and going up in dosage instead. I just want to be off of the sludge! I am really considering going CT with naltrexone like I have in the past, and the only thing stopping me is the fact that I failed with that exact method three different times at the beginning of the year. Unlike my past attempts, I am a lot less stressed due to uni not currently being in session, but I just know that I don't currently have the habits needed to live healthily post kratom and am afraid that I wont build them fast enough after my CT and will relapse and be worse off mentally than I would be if I went slow and steady with a taper. Sadly, the rest of the slow taper will probably take until the end of July to finish, and part of me just thinks I need to get off of kratom and deal with the consequences so I can start building my kratom free life back up now, sooner rather than later.

While ultimately this is gonna have to be my decision to make (taper vs CT), I would love some comments with advise and experiences, both to get my thoughts swirling and to help me once again start engaging in this community. I turn 21 today and am ready to get back on a path I am proud of, to regain what I have lost in my year of kratom haze. If you made it this far in my post, thanks for reading!

## Abstract

***To test the effect of 32 mg of buprenorphine on the withdrawal process from heroin, 10 street-heroin using subjects were given 32 mg of sublingual buprenorphine, following heroin abstinence of 24 hours. Withdrawal symptoms were monitored during the first few hours, and followed for six days after buprenorphine administration, after which naltrexone (50 mg) was introduced to prevent future heroin use. Nine subjects completed detoxification with negligible withdrawal symptoms and a smooth transition to naltrexone. One subject was excluded from the study due to methadone ingestion prior to experiment. These results strongly suggest that painless detoxification from heroin can be obtained by a single high dose of buprenorphine.***

Basically if it works for heroin, wouldn't it also work for kratom? My doctor has written me an Rx for 32 milligram of subutex (buprenorphine w/o naloxone) to be taken once. He says he'd be willing to follow up with a prescription for naltrexone and eventually the vivitrol shot IF I want it. 

But first things first...

My doctor said that this was how buprenorphine was meant to be taken before the corporations discovered how profitable maintenance programs can be  and that I'll avoid the majority of the acute withdrawals and that he can provide supplemental medicine (clonodine, seroquel, lomotil etc.) as needed after the buprenorphine starts to wear off.

2020-06-06 22:32:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/gy4b1y/my_tapering_experience_so_far/,my tapering experience so far,"Good evening, folks. I am new here, and just wanted to share the story of my experience with kratom, especially my current tapering process- it has been going on for about 4-5 days now.  I realize this post a bit on the ""tl dr"" side, so no offense taken if not everyone reads and/or responds. Things are stable at the moment--if I reach a point where I need help, I'll undoubtedly be much more brief.  Maybe at some point I will be able to help someone else out (who knows, maybe someone will even find this post helpful).

So- I was taking quite a lot for about this last 3 years. Too much- more than was really necessary. Diminishing returns--i.e., it got to the point where the amount I'd have to take to really feel ""satisfied"" would make me physically sick. We're talking 5 teaspoon (so 10 gram) portions at multiple times throughout the day. The full amount was probably 40-50 grams daily. Maybe more on some days.

I reduced my servings to 3 teaspoons at a time for awhile, and that honestly ended up being still pretty comfortable... though, possibly because I then went on to take it more times a day. In truth, I was probably still totaling about 40g a day. One day I cut it down to 2 tsp a serving but the frequency increased a bit more too-- I'd estimate I was taking 30-35 grams daily--and I still didn't feel so bad, in fact pretty good most of the time except for the depressing low points as the kratom effects trailed off each time. I told myself I was starting to taper, but really that was bullshit. I had no real plan in place, and really my daily total amount was barely less than before.

That went on for a couple more days. Then, since I got some time off work, I tried cold turkey. It might seem like I was stupid to do that, but it was a really important learning experience that I'm very glad I had (once). But, anyway... yeah, just no fucking way. It was way beyond miserable. It's one thing to feel ""low,"" another to be unable to feel ANY pleasures, even the smallest ones. Probably the biggest lesson I have learned from kratom is that those small everyday pleasures that we take for granted are really what life is made out of. Someone might be having a ""bad day"" and their disposition might very clearly express this. But, then even while they're all salty and grumbling you'll see them be engrossed in a good tv show, laugh at a joke, enjoy a meal, feel relaxed by a hot shower, get a task done and feel a modest but adequately satisfying sense of accomplishment. The little things. The level of depression I felt on the CT kratom withdrawal robs you of even that. I've never been through any other wd before, and I was quite honestly shocked at just *how* bad I felt. I couldn't think clearly, couldn't focus couldn't accomplish even the slightest task, and I just wouldn't wish the way I felt on *anybody*\*.\*  I can only imagine what heroin or pill form opiate WDs must be like.  I suppose I could have tried for longer, but by 6 pm I caved in and took one teaspoon. It made me feel ""ok,"" and just feeling ok was like feeling great at that point. More importantly, I was again able to function.... and, not to sound overdramatic, but, just to tolerate being. That had to be enough.

Anyway, I quickly figured out that the tapering route was going to be the way to go for me. I took a couple more one-teaspoon doses over the course of the evening. The next day, I decided that I would start my taper by limiting each dose to 1 tablespoon (2 grams)- really, just to ward off wd-induced depression and other symptoms. Just for this first day, I played the dose frequency by ear, making sure I disciplined myself not to take the next one until I really felt the need to-- I managed this, and by the next day I had figured out that the ideal amount for now would be about 15 grams a day. Since I had gotten a scale and determined that each teaspoon consistently measured out to either 2.1 or 2.2 grams (or, rarely, 2.3), that meant 7 doses spread throughout the day would total up to about 15 grams, maybe even a touch less.

What happened was, the first day of taking about that amount had been a uncomfortable, kind of miserable, but nowhere even in the ballpark of what CT felt like, and I was able to deal with it. The next day, continuing to stick to this dosage, I woke up feeling much better than I had since the CT, and was pleasantly surprised to find that my day wasn't all so bad, all while sticking to the daily quantity I had set for myself.

&#x200B;

By the way, not that it matters very much, but my strain of choice is Super Green Malay. I am well aware of the recommendations to always stay on the same strain while tapering.

&#x200B;

So, anyway, I have been sticking to this amount for 3 days, feeling ok, and I plan to reduce each dose by a quarter of a gram or maybe 0.2 grams in two days from now.  You know what... yeah, I think I'm going to do 0.2.

Here's what I *think* is going on based on my experience and the info I have read here so far-- if anyone thinks I am interpreting the process incorrectly, please feel free to say so. My body has adjusted to the smaller daily quantity, and that's why it's not giving me fresh hell from the inside, and I am able to get through the day reasonably well. When I cut down further in a couple of days here, I might have a slightly more uncomfortable day but then my body will adjust again and I'll stick with that new amount for another few days.... rinse and repeat with 0.2 gram taper-downs until I am done, maybe ending by jumping off from my 0.2 gram period, expecting a bit of discomfort for a couple days or so but nothing remotely like the initial CT. I noticed even this morning when I woke up with restless leg, it was so much milder than before, I even felt myself chuckling because it felt a bit like a ""tickle,"" and my mood was a bit crappy but entirely manageable. I am figuring that it will all go even smoother when I am down to much lower doses. All I will have to do then is manage myself psychologically- keep myself busy and ignore the voice in me that tells me I ought to be experiencing ""big"" moments of euphoria. I sure hope all this goes down as well as I'm hoping.

My main problems are mental. Deression, lack of motivation, and fucking BOREDOM most of all. I used to be so content just toss and washing and sitting around playing video games, listening to music, surfing Reddit etc. 
The tempatation I am feeling right now to take a few spoonfulls of the green goblin is insane. Not gonna lie I totally miss being a lazy fiend for this shit, but then I know I have to be better! 

All addictions I have had are rooted in this same mentality. With alcohol I used to always drink out of boredom. I am sitting here bored, I may aswell get drunk to make life more interesting! I then used kratom to get away from the booze which was easy. This seems way tougher to me than stopping binge drinking, because kratom is so seemingly gentle and subtle, where as alcohol was a commitment, once you start drinking you are strapped in for a wild ride, that factor alone made quitting pretty easy.

I told them it had been a rough, long, hot day and I was just ready for the week to be over. They handed me 4 pills and said, try this. It's this herbal stuff that gives you energy and lifts your mood. 

I was hesitant to accept it because I knew I had struggled with liking pills a little too much in the past but reluctantly I took them. The next day while doing my deliveries I decided to take two about 2 hours into work. After about 30 minutes I was feeling great. Relaxed, euphoric, ready to take on my day, and in just a good mood. I recognized the effects, I knew this must be related to opioids because the feeling was just too similar. I looked up the drug and was right, similar mechanism of action as opioids. I was hooked and went back for more the next day.

After leaving that job a few months later, I realized I had to quit it (this was in October of 2018). I am a Christian and I could feel the Lord telling me I needed to stop this stuff. But I hardened my heart and said ""Nah I am going to keep taking it, it's not really a problem, I can quit whenever I want."" My addiction then *really* took off, and my spiritual growth came to a screeching halt. I had felt the love of God many times in prayer, reading the Bible, or when playing in the church band, but all that immediately stopped when I decided I would keep taking it- and in the year and a half since I have felt little to none of the Holy Spirit except in times of moderate repentance (deciding to bring down the dose). So if you are a Christian- know that willful disobedience will nuke your relationship with God.

Following my decision to keep taking it even though I knew I was supposed to stop, I quickly worked my way up to over 30 pills a day. Sometimes as many as 40. I would take as many as 9 in one dose, then pop 3 half an hour later if they weren't kicking in enough. I liked to take my Kratom, have a little coffee, and play some video games (I'm a former WoW addict as well). My mind would disappear for 3-4 hours into a Kratom binge, and I felt so empty after it all. My wife and I finally confronted the problem. I agreed to taper down 2 a day from 40. It was easy until I got to about 24, then it got harder. I worked my way to 14 and quickly relapsed back up to over 20. This wasn't going to be easy.

Finally I decided I just had to straight up stop. I threw the pills in the trash and said the hell with it, I'm done. I felt good and empowering to be rid of the stuff but I knew I was about to be in for a world of pain. I made it through that day and had a fitful sleep that night. I woke up feeling a little better but the day quickly crumbled. I'll never forget what happened next, when I knew I had hit the rock bottom. My wife left to run some errands in the afternoon and I found myself contemplating going out to my garbage can, fishing out the trash bag that I threw the pills into, and taking them.

And I did. I was disgusted with myself. ""Look at yourself, dude. Fishing pills out of the garbage? You have a real problem."" I emptied the pills into powder form so I could avoid any gunk from the garbage and ingested them that way. That's when I discovered the powder hits way harder than the caps. Great.

I continue to take Kratom (as powder) over the next year at a slightly more reasonable dose, anywhere from 12-18 pills per day in powder form. It wasn't until I found out at the end of last year that, unexpectedly, my wife was pregnant with our first born child.

  
I knew I had to quit, I immediately cut down to 10 per day, but continued to yo-yo between 7-17. Slowly over the first several months of 2020 I worked my way down to no more than 14 a day, then no more than 12, then no more than 11. I got as low as 6 per day a couple weeks ago then cycled up. I was so close.. I wanted to quit outright but I was terrified of the withdrawals. My work schedule doesn't allow me to just take a week and feel terrible.

Finally, we watched a movie about the Rapture- the return of Christ. I was terrified. I knew the Lord wanted me to stop this, he wanted me to stop a long time ago, and I couldn't stop thinking, if he DID return, what would I say to him when he confronted me over this? He told me 18 months ago to quit and I laughed in his face and said no. Looking amidst all the chaos going on in the US I thought, ""If he did return, would he even take me?"" It honestly scared the hell out of me and I resolved to stop. That was 5 days ago and I haven't had a single pill since. So in short, it was the upcoming birth of my son (in August) and the fear of the Lord that finally did the trick for me. Now caffeine remains my only addiction.

The withdrawals at first naturally sucked, but after about 72-84 hours they weren't so bad. They are definitely better after a night of good rest. 5 days later (today) and I feel much better and I am really happy to be off the stuff. I still miss it, but I don't crave it. But after a day like today when I spent 3 hours clearing out my yard and lifting a ton of heavy crud I keep thinking, ""Man I would loveee some Kratom right now."" I'd like to stay off it forever, but I'd also like to be able to take it reasonably, but I think the best bet is to just never get it again.

So that's my story. If you are struggling to quit I definitely recommend tapering and at some point you just have to take what you have and dump it out, that's the key. It's an empowering decision that tells yourself, ""I want to be rid of this habit so much I am willing to trash my stash."" Do not leave any around the home, it's too tempting. Do not let yourself even look at the store that sells it as you drive by in your car. Avoid every association with it at all cost. Have someone to hold you accountable, for me it was my wife and the Lord. And just know that after about 3 days, it really isn't so bad. It'll suck, being hooked sucks a lot more.

30 gram per day habit, 2 years
6 months before that 40 gpd, 3 years
A couple years before that 40ish gpd,  4 years

Just so we are clear, withdrawals get worse for some even when dosages are lower, the longer we use. 
Wrote this day six but couldn't figure out how to post:
I finally slept this morning about 4 solid hours, and was able to function slightly better today without copious amounts of ephedrine. Today actually felt a little worse than yesterday because of the not taking ephedrine upon getting out of bed probably. 

My story is the same as many others; pain pills, tar, subs, alcoholic AF, rock, dope, etc. Then kratom... lol.

Aside from psychedelics, kratom has been my favorite drug for about ten years, ""laser focus"" and upping my abilities intellectually so consistently, were my favorite effects. Key word there is ""were""... kratom works wonderfully for me for about six months to a year at a time before it dosen't, and when it stops, it grabs your restless legs and apathy and lords them over your head until you again buy a couple kilos, atleast in my case. 

I am writing this because I am not a huge fan of using something without payment, and I am in great debt to the folk that have posted here. Thank you much for your efforts and honesty.

Following is my timeline so far, and plans for the next couple days while sleep is still hit/miss:

Days 1-3
May it be noted that I was taking a dose at about midnight every night to stay asleep for the last two months after going to bed and having had my last dose at 6pm ish.

Restless legs and arms, crying,  jerking it 12 times a day, and pooping 7 or 8 times a day...
The worst part being the restless leg and arm shit at night. I tried clonidine,  gabapentin, tizanidine, weed and 40 mg of loperamide... nothing fucking helped but constant masterbation and burning hot baths.

Day 4 and 5:
Slept about 3.5 hours total, in 20 minute increments these nights, cried all day, but forced myself to clean and eat. I'll note here, I have lost 15 lbs, you should force yourself to eat, dont get all methed up looking like me. Lol

Day six: since I began acute withdrawl at 3am, day six started at 3am this morning.
Slept about 2.5 hours from 11 pm to 7:30 am ""night 5"" and fell back asleep at 7:45ish to wake at 12:20 this afternoon;4.5 hours ish. Dragged fucking ass from then till now, cleaned and did some work, but dragged ass without my helper ephedrine today. 

Day 7:
Didn't sleep for shit last night, day seven is equating to zero energy or motivation, and cravings like hell.

Days 1-5 were physical and mental hell. Today has been shit, but better, I planned on getting a small bag and taking just enough to sleep tonight, lol, but luckily had one of those epiphanous episodes, and while crying like a little school boy that got bag tagged,  laughed at my lack of guard being raised to my wonderful addiction. I did not purchase more thank god or allah or the grand scheme of things or whatever bullshit you believe;) so, that is enough of that.

I plan on ""toughing shit out"" the next few days while my sleep quality gets more normalized.
Hopefully laying off the ephedrine completely after day 8. I'm not much of an upper lady anyways.
If you have questions regarding whether or not you need to stop, wait until you just start withdrawal and eat 6 or 7 g cubes... I got my answer, and apparently others have had similar experiences.  If you are not one that enjoys having a talk with your knowing subconscious, or get scared easily, don't do this, but if you enjoy a challenge and having father time point out your defects to work on, potentially in a setting where you are being cut up and fed to skeleton monsters from another dimension, please take my advice and your answers will be revealed. 

A warning: if you are a fucking junky like me, you probably shouldn't fuck with this shit. I would rather withdraw from tar than Kratom. Alcohol was worse having almost died and shit, but it was also a completely different animal. Kratom is not all that well understood, and is more similar to opium withdrawl than anything else I could pin down, but since I'm the only one I know that ever even had opium regularly enough to get addicted physically, that is probably an impertinent statement. Kratom is physically terrible to withdraw from, but also can drag you to some very low mental places too, which heroin and other opiates never really did  to me (even opium did not fuck my mind like kratom during WDs).

So, if you are willing to trade six months of awesome performance and cold emotional state for 10 days of hell, this may be the drug for you, otherwise, as smokems the bear said before he died, ""dont do it bitch"".

I love you guys, and thank you from the bottom of my deleterious heart.  If you are or are planning to be in my position, please heed the advice and timeframes of the numbnuts that have gone to hell before you. 

""This too shall pass"" 
Namaste or whatever bullshit you kids say nowadays.

In my junior year of high school, I was caught vaping on campus and got drug tested. Positive for weed. I was then subject to random drug tests until graduation. Now, I was a very heavy marijuana user and couldn’t seem to fill the void that my daily use created. After a couple google searches, my “savior” came; Kratom, a legal, readily-available high.  I heard that it could be “sort of addictive but only if you huge amounts”, so I tried to only use it 2-3 times a week. By the 4th week, I was taking it multiple times a day.  My routine for 1.5 years was: wake up, take 2 tsp.  At 5pm, take 3 tsp. Here I am, a month after graduation from high school realizing that I am a full blown drug addict. What first made me realize how Kratom had ruined me was when I started experiencing hair loss a week ago. At 18. I quickly found that Kratom had caused it, and as I read I realized what I had done to myself. The shaking, the need to isolate, the anxiety, the mental degeneration, the total loss of motivation.  I didn’t understand why I grew distant from my friends and became a recluse. I didn’t understand why I was slurring my words and stuttering. I didn’t understand why I got extreme anxiety whenever talking to my parents making me grow distant from them. It was the stupid powder I was forcing down my throat all day. The fact I didn’t realize this until my hair was literally falling off my head shows how stupid this drug made me. 24 hours off of Kratom and I am using weed to help smooth out the WDs. So far, not too bad but I know it’s all downhill from here. 

Sorry for the long post and yes I 100% realize what a stupid kid I am. Made a throwaway just for this subreddit.

My questions (in your personal experience quitting Kratom):

How long will it take before I feel excited and social again? 
How long until the hair loss stops? How long until the lost hair starts to grow back?
How long until I will be able to communicate my thoughts efficiently again?

I started using kratom 6 years ago, and it started out pretty benign but somewhere along the lines it got a grip on me and turned things upside down. I started failing classes (had to withdraw from school) started showing up at social events clearly not sober, lost longtime girlfriend I was planning to marry, skipped seeing my family so I could get high, skipped seeing my friends so I could get high. I spent too much on it, turned me into a lethargic sloth because I’d take heavy red veins, friend group dwindled, hobbies dwindled, everyday things took a hit. I put my family through hell dealing with it. 

Now I’m at 7 days, someone on here messaged me trying to sell me kratom, I’ve had the ability to get it, and my friend just called me asking if I wanted to dose. I said no to all of that, feeling much better than the first few days, still things that suck, but the biggest thing about quitting to me is for me to be in a fog for 6 years to finally see it clear up, see what I used to be like, who I am sober, and that’s the most amazing part. After so long being on this everyday, most of my friends have only ever known me on K, never met the sober me. Music is amazing. Eating is a little bit of a challenge but doable. My bones don’t ache anymore. I don’t sleep too much, but I already barely slept before k. Colors are SO MUCH brighter and vibrant, it’s honestly incredible. I’m proud I got to day 7. I’ve resisted it when it’s showed up right in front of me, talked to people and already a couple have said I look happier than usual. 

To anyone out there still struggling, however you end the addiction by tapering or ct or what have you, just get past the initial acute withdrawals, I feel like I just changed so much this last week and though I may have more withdrawals to come I’ll welcome them with a warm embrace of sobriety.  

Everyone still struggling or off of it, good on you for making the decision, realizing what this is, coming to this forum and asking questions to move your life forward in a positive direction

But I do wonder if my case might be different because of how much I've been taking. Here's my situation/back story.

I started kratom about 3&1/2 years ago. Casual, 3 gram doses a couple times a week. Snowballed to everyday huge doses. At it's height I was buying a 250 gram bag of powder every other day.

I delt with: 
A complete loss of saving money.
Vomiting several times a week after too much kratom. Often seeing blood in the vomit. (Dunno if that's from my stomach or my throat?) & that wouldn't stop me from taking the next dose.
Sometimes I would overdose and get insanely dizzy (I found a brand that would avoid this overdose effect)
Painful & incredibly difficult to poop.
Lack of appetite/weight loss
Lack of motivation for all the good things I was doing in life.

I quit for 40 days once. This was about 6 months ago. Unfortunately I started again and I'm slowly returning to my old peak of the amount and doses I was taking. Right now I'm taking probably 80 grams a day, split over 4-6 doses each day.

I wanted to share what helped me with my RLS/insomnia problem because theres too much misinformation and confusion when it comes to this. Magnesium, valerian root, melatonin, and ibuprofen was absolutely useless for me. It did not help at all and kept sleeping 1-4 hours each day (EVEN ON DAY 18). This is literally the only withdrawal I got and flu symptoms on Day 8-12. So i said enough was enough, went to a CBD store, smoked the CBD, and bam, slept good and no RLS. I also took a hot shower too before going to bed. Weed helps; on week 2 I also ate edibles for 4 days and that helped too but I didnt want to get high anymore (was in the process of quitting weed too). So take CBD if you dont want to get high (smoke or eat it), or get high with THC. This helped me and many others and it should help you too! Best of luck. Xanax also helps too but I dont have much access to it.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4225454}"

I've quit twice before and both times had 3-4 days of acute Opie w/d. 

I used to protocol as outlined in one of the main studies of attentuating heroine w/d using vit C. I got the good liposomal (liquid) sodium ascorbate 3 days prior to quitting and started loading it. No, it doesn't block kratom's effects!

On the last day of kratom use I was taking 5000mg-7500mg every three hours. It's a lot. If you tried this with other forms of vitamin C like asorbic acid it's too hard on the stomach. Sodium ascorbate is well buffered so doesn't irritate and the liposomal form has great absorption.

One I quit taking kratom then I started to titrate the vit C and my immediate experience was that my w/d SYMPTOMS were to large extent taken care of by the vit C (especially the classic W/d SYMPTOMS like sniffling, sneezing, chills etc...)

Unfortunately anxiety, depression, RLS and fatigue were not affected by the vit C, just the physical flu-like opiate w/d SYMPTOMS so many of us are familiar with.

Here's the whole protocol (taken from a study done of withdrawing heroine addicts)

Day-One (three days prior to day of with-
drawal): Drink six ounces diluted fruit juice 
(DFJ) containing 500-1000 mg of sodium 
ascorbate (SA) every two hours until bedtime. 
* Day-Two: Drink DFJ with 1,000-2,500 mg 
of SA every two hours until bedtime. 
* Day-!ree: Drink DFJ with 5,000-7,500 
mg SA every three hours until bedtime. Begin 
withdrawal at bedtime. If withdrawal symp-
toms occur during the night, DFJ with 5000-
7500 mg SA, administered when awake, and 
taken every two hours until symptoms abate. 
* Day-Four: DFJ with 2,500-5,000 mg SA ev-
ery two hours until bedtime. If symptoms oc-
cur during the night, DFJ with 2500-5000 mg 
SA, administered when awake, and taken every 
two hours until symptoms abate. 
* Day-Five: DFJ with 1,000-2,500 mg SA 
every two hours until bedtime. If symptoms 
occur during the night, DFJ with 1,000-2,500 
mg SA, administered when awake, and taken 
every two hours until symptoms abate. 
* Day-Six: DFJ with 1,000 mg SA every two 
hours until bedtime. If symptoms occur during 
the night, DFJ with 1,000 mg SA, adminis-
tered when awake, and taken every two hours 
until symptoms abate.

The overall gpd also rose but peaked at roughly 20gpd maybe 25gpd on heavy days, so nothing too crazy.
I'm now on day 3 without and have my energy back and feel mostly 75% normal. But this is how it went every time. I stopped and hated how the withdrawals made me feel and swore to never do it again, that my life is better this way.

But I always took it again after a few days.

How do you stay sober? any help is greatly appreciated.

2020-06-04 19:54:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/gwtdby/addiction_is_my_addiction/,Addiction is my addiction.,"It isn't nicotine,  it isn't weed, or alcohol,  and it isn't kratom.  It has taken me much too long to realize this, but I now constantly remind myself, because that is what matters,  not the substance. I'm turning 25 in July, so it's about time.  

I have spent much too long of my adult life looking for that dopamine rush. I started smoking pot at 15, drinking at 16, nicotine at 17 off and on until 21 when I started vaping 6mg nicotine consistently, adderall since college whenever I could get it which isn't often and isn't something I feel addicted to, and kratom starting in 2017, with progressively higher doses between 2-6 heaping tablespoons every day. 

Then recently I had to ask myself, as I'm sure you all have, ""what have any of these drugs done to improve my quality of life?"" 

The short answer, is not much. Besides the acute honeymoon phases, my life did not progress as I would have assumed based off the feeling that these drugs initially provided, chiefly regarding Kratom.  At first,  of course,  it took away my social and general anxiety, depression, allowed me to look people in the eyes and feel a more general interest in the world around me. I excelled at my job, which isnt saying much as my best year was only about 50k with no benefits,  but to me it was progress.  Then,  my dose increased as my anxiety started returning.  I needed more, and more. Not to chase a feeling, but to chase away old feelings returning.  About a year and a few months in I told myself, ""well, I haven't seen any negative side effects besides increased dose, so I am content making this my addiction as long as it keeps me content."" A classical run from my problems,  but if I could get away with it forever,  then why the hell not? But, reality had other plans as I began quickly losing my hair, and digestive issues that blocked me for 2 weeks with excruciating pain. 
Kratom began to be additionally used now to chase away pain that was induced by the plant itself. I was addicted.  
2 years in I really wanted to quit,  and told myself that often. My diet was meager, which prevented me from working out all the time to instead becoming content with the high, and if I did work out, i took so long to recover that I couldn't maintain a routine.  Exercise was a huge part of my life, one that I neglected and substituted for kratom. 
I took it all throughout the day, every day. If I started feeling apathetic and depressed, I'd hit my vape and artificially trick my body that I was being productive. I would vape and take a dose and watch YouTube until 3am often because I told myself I would smoke pot to fall asleep at a reasonable time, but rarely worked out that way. These routines allowed me to continue my video game addiction (fortnite) that I had begun shortly after getting into kratom. Because I was moved out on my own and had a job, I convinced myself that I earned the time I spent relaxing.
I have wasted months of my time, literally months, sinking into contentment playing video games, watching Netflix or YouTube,  and on my phone deep diving into shit that doesn't need to be examined so intensely.  
I have hobbies though,  or so I told myself. I still managed to record and write music during that time,  albeit not as much as I'd have liked. I still found time to hang out with friends, but often forced myself to more than not. I had good work relationships with my coworkers, and my customers loved me. But...

One day I realized that I was isolating myself more and more, and my friend group had dwindled to almost nothing. Of course I was aware of all this, but I was content with it, without being content with it at the same time. Music has always been important to me as well, and I realized if I am isolating so that I only come out for work, and an oil change here and there, I will never progress in my music the way I wanted to. Not only that, but what happened to the old me?? Sure, I had depression, and bipolar-like anxiety, and focus issues and all that comes with it, but I also had goals. 

I think that's when it hit me:

You can't know love if you haven't known hate. 
You can't be happy if you've never been sad. 
You can't grow from hurt if you never let yourself be hurt.
And you can't spend your entire life depending on artificially created emotions and expect to progress, because your emotions are fake, but the world is real, and your forced fantasy will never turn you into what you want to become If you spend your whole time content and dreaming rather than being disciplined and  physically working towards those dreams.

So, I decided, no more attempts,  no more slipping back. I will experience pain,  but pain is natural. I embrace it. I will experience sadness beyond anything I've felt for the last 3 years. I embrace it. I will spend days in a depression, gently calling me back, reminding me why I took kratom in the first place.  And I will fight it! Because I have been given the insight to realize the path I've taken was the wrong path.

But how could I quit, when I've failed so many times before? I wanted to quit more than anything. I thought about each addiction individually.  Weed, mental addiction more than physical. Nicotine,  something I thought about the minute I woke up. Kratom, the king of my crippled lifestyle. So why did I take them in the first place? If I do quit how can I prevent myself from going back to them, or any other substance to replace them?

Ahhh...

I realized then that I wouldn't be taking a drug to replace a drug,  but instead to replace a feeling, a high. This fact, while presumably obvious, is not.  The meaning is much more substantial. If I quit drugs, and didn't choose different ones as a an alternative,  would I just be fine? Definitely not. I couldn't maintain my lifestyle wasting away. 

I finally understood I was addicted to addiction, and addicted long before I tried pot back at age 15. Drugs enhanced my ""sober"" addictions, but didnt create them.

From an early age, I was addicted to video games. 
I was addicted to porn.
I was addicted to caffeine. 
I was addicted to the rush of staying up late.
I was addicted to spending money.
I was addicted to adrenaline.  
I was addicted to fast food and candy. 
I was addicted to my phone and social media.
I was addicted to being liked. 

And the truth is,  I still am.

These addictions are quiet, they're sneaky, and are not positive or always encouraged , but are accepted. No one will try and truly hold you accountable for any of them. The thrill of over indulging my whole life has created patterns that have made me addicted to addiction,  to anything that gives me a rush of dopamine.  Anything that makes me feel good. Of course, you can be addicted to helping others, or addicted to religion and cleaning your house once a week. But its addiction, and too much of anything is bad. Of course, I evidently gravitate towards the bad, or at least I over indulge so much that it has become considered bad. 
My routine has been formed and wired through addiction,  because I was not adequately taught to cope with my childhood traumas, and the ones who gave me the scars are also the ones who neglected to teach me discipline.

At age 17, I started smoking, then vaping, then 1 year ago I switched to nicotine gum, and fluctuated in my milligram amount, but still chewed it constantly.  
I QUIT on April 29th, 2020. 

3 years ago I came from a party lifestyle in college and drank about every other day.
I QUIT getting drunk 3 years ago, having a mixed drink or a beer once every few months if the social situation required it in order to not be seen as rude or standoffish. 

I've smoked pot since age 15, off and on, but much more often with kratom to help me sleep.
I QUIT a little over 1 month ago, and will mostly stay away from it with the knowledge I have realized. I will not use it as a sleep aid, and may once in a blue moon use it as a reminder to check my natural state of being, as pot is the least harmful of all of the drugs I've done and is notably therapeutic for many people. No more buying bags of it however, that's not who i am anymore. And honestly,  whether you believe it's a gateway or not, it definitely chills you out and that should be enough to indicate its negative potential right there.

Finally, I have taken progressively bigger and bigger doses of kratom for over 3 years to mask what i subconsciously refused to acknowledge. I will not deny the benefit of this plant, nor the benefits I received from anything else I've taken,  as it was obviously necessary for me to reach this spot in my life (otherwise I wouldn't be here, ya dig?). It has shown me a different side of me that I hope to get close to obtaining naturally and in a controlled manner. But i no longer need this mask.
I QUIT kratom one week ago after tapering for a month. Most of my WD's were experienced in the taper as I'd tried tapering 6 months before that, so this week has been rough,  but tolerable. Because I realized while I quit kratom, im truly really quitting addiction. Your withdrawal experience is as bad as you let it be. Truthfully, substance addiction is where you let your mind go while quitting. A quick example are cigarettes.  If you weren't aware, tobacco companies are forced to make and pay for ads to deter you from smoking. They tell you how awful quitting is, show you a literal monkey on your back, pharmacy companies make their money by saying the same thing to get you on their prescriptions longer. It's a scam. In terms of how and it actually is, it is nothing like they portray. But its easy to get brainwashed to believe its near impossible. They brainwashed me. Until someone explained to me what I just told you, I was looking at a tsunami. When all I really had to do was walk through a puddle and get a little wet. It's the reason why after an 8 year nicotine addiction, I truly hardly think about it now after 1 month. The same is true about pot, and booze, and while kratom was the heaviest monkey I put on my back, we've started to become friends, and he no longer holds on so tight. He'll be going back to the zoo soon :) 

If you've read this far, I'm sure you're wondering how to go about beating an addiction to addiction. 

Well, no one is ever truly free of addiction. No one. But you have to start from a place free from drugs. Then you start bending addiction to your will, and controlling it. It'll fight back, and you might slip... you can forgive yourself for slipping. But you won't fall. If you've reached this point, you aren't fucking around anymore. The demons are gone and the devil is scared. 
Remind yourself whenever you lay down, whenever you sit in front of the TV, if there's something else you could be doing that is more beneficial to you, something you're putting off. If you feel guilty about how you are spending your time, then you're not spending it right. Use that knowledge as a guideline, as a life rope. 
Bend your addiction to your will, and begin replacing the bad with the things you've said you'd always do, or things you loved that you fell away from over the years. 

Most importantly, as much as you've probabaly rolled your eyes at this and said, ""yeah yeah, I know""-- SLEEP, DIET, AND EXERCISE. (But do learn to be okay with going without them sometimes- even the healthiest people get bad sleep sometimes!)

If you're like me, my depression and anxiety was caused by an unknown ratio of biological and environmental factors.  I do however think it's safe to say the majority was caused by stress caused by environmental ones.

There have been weeks, before and even on drugs, in the past,  where I found a spurt of random discipline for no reason that I could maintain for a week or 2 at a max, where I would eat 3 balanced meals a day, go to sleep before 11 without being on my phone or laptop, and I have always been physically very active, until a year in on my nicotine and kratom addictions. 
When I did this and drank plenty of water and maintained my health, my depression and anxiety vanished. I still had trauma, but coping was unfathomably more tolerable. Colors were brighter,  people smiled more..I smiled more. Unfortunately, once I became that comfortable for too long, (which was never very long at all)  I took it for granted and would start rewarding myself with staying up later, taking a party drug with a friend and playing video games all night, drinking alcohol which is a depressant because I felt so good. And then I would spiral,  and I'd be back in the demons' waiting room, with no answer to why I was back, or why I stopped eating or sleeping right. Now I know better. When I was young and naive, I assumed a tree was all that I saw it was. If someone chopped the tree in half, it would die. Now I understand that the tree has roots, and if you want that tree to die, that's where you chop. If you fail to sever everything properly, that tree will eventually grow back, so you must keep chopping until that tree is dead. Fuck, burn the whole ground if you have the gas.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am almost 25, and I have been responsible for myself for quite some time now, but healing is difficult, and I feel for those that went through worse situations growing up than I did, but I hope that all of this will help you to understand, and overcome.

So I decided to double down on nutrition instead.

Im not completely sure if I am doing this right, but I have some background in nutrition through self taught and parts of nursing curriculum so this is my best shot at this.

I decided to take a trip to GNC. Instead of buying a bunch of amino acids to speed up recovery and spending like $1000 I decided to take more protein instead. On the packaging it hits all the amino acids I was going to buy anyways to facilitate recovery. The ones im talking about are threonine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine. I figure one 25g scoop daily combined with my diet should be enough. I combine that with a multivitamin which I will cut the dose in half in a week because contrary to popular beilef, more vitamins aren't necessarily better.  Taking it with an already healthy diet I will be at risk of consuming too many vitamins. The one vitamin I will be taking in excess is vitamin D because of its hormonal and antidepressant activity in the body and consuming 4000 IUs of it daily has been deemed safe. At last I will be taking fish oil pills to cover my EPA and DHA fatty acids to support brain health in this needed time.

My actual diet will look something similar to a paleo diet. Lots of whole fruits, vegetables, nuts, and olive oil. A few carbs, but their all whole grain. A sample day would look like this.

(85g per day),"Been ruminating a lot recently about the past and who I was when I was abusing drugs and addicted to kratom. Figured it would be good for me to share my story and give hope to those who are currently struggling with kratom . 

My drug addiction mainly started around freshman year of college. I had some serious anxiety and depression throughout my senior year of high school . This seemed to be triggered after I started drinking / smoking weed. I was put on Lexapro (an ssri/antidepressant) and anxiety started to go away and I was enjoying my life. Soon after , I started partying way more, drinking a lot, smoking a lot, trying other drugs very recklessly (benzos, stimulants) . 

Started buying adderall from friends and noticed it “helped” my depression. Or so my addict mind thought. Being a dumb teenager , I asked my psychiatrist for adderall because I thought it would help with the depression. Was given a script , and started taking it daily . Felt good for awhile - energized, happy , etc. Then I left for college . 

During my first semester at college , my drug usage ramped up heavily . I was snorting the adderall , drinking and blacking out every weekend, and losing control. This is when I slipped into an addiction to being high (on anything). My addict brain was deluded into thinking I was invincible and could do all the drugs I wanted . At the time , I really wasn’t aware I was losing control of myself, or I didn’t care . Then there was an incident where I blacked out and got in trouble with the school due to disorderly conduct . I realized something was wrong with me at this point, I figured it was the adderall.

Sooo I got off the adderall and was very depressed for awhile and then I discovered kratom. After my first time taking it I was amazed by it . Life felt beautiful again , I was happy, calm , very sociable. I started taking it daily . Life was great for awhile . Then it stopped working like it used to . And once again, I was miserable 

My life really changed at this point for the worse. I got into trouble with the school for being intoxicated numerous times , and was close to being kicked out. They gave me another chance because I managed to sustain a 3.5 GPA (somehow).

I transferred out of that school to a school far away from home. I was a mess at this point . So severely depressed, abusing Xanax, kratom , alcohol, adderall, and other drugs . School was no longer my priority , getting high was my mission daily. For awhile I managed to stay away from other drugs and just take kratom , and I was taking up to 80-85g daily . Eventually I got suspended from the school for drinking related offenses . 

When I got back home to my parents house shit really hit the fan. They were shocked by my addiction, and I felt so incredibly guilty. I was out of control emotionally and was just not myself whatsoever, a shell of my past self . I was abusing Xanax and kratom heavily and blacking out , driving fucked up, and overall self destructing . I could NOT stop taking kratom or other drugs and I hated myself for it . 

After being hospitalized a few times for alcohol poisoning , and other drug related things- i went to a 28 day in patient rehab. This was my first real attempt at trying to get clean from all drugs .

As soon as a got out Of rehab I drove to a smoke shop and bought kratom. I was so ashamed of myself but really felt like I was not in control . I HAD to have it in my mind . This is such a scary and miserable feeling. I was on and off kratom for months - and these months were the darkest period of my life . I was really trying to fight the addiction but every time I was powerless over it . I was going to AA, got a sponsor and everything but it wasn’t working for me . I even rapid detoxed with naltrexone (which is AWFUL and kind of traumatizing - do not try it ). I just kept relapsing and my depression was unbearable. 

Eventually, a little over a year ago , there was something I can’t explain that gave me power to get off the kratom. Though, I was using weed as a crutch , I managed to quit kratom and everything else (besides weed). The withdrawal from kratom is pretty bad , not gonna lie. My experience may be different though because my brain was very beat up from other drugs as well. Had I just been taking kratom and nothing else my withdrawal may have been less severe . 

This past year my brain has recovered a lot. I haven’t used kratom, alcohol, Xanax , or any of those drugs I was abusing before . My emotions were really up and down at first but for the most part they have stabilized. Though, these past few months have been a little difficult, I finally tapered off my psych meds (lexapro, gabapentin) and cut back my weed usage drastically . With everything going on in the world right now honestly it’s been hard . But my life now is so much better than when I was addicted to kratom . 

It is possible to get off this drug- Those who are currently struggling I can assure you there is Hope. Some things I recommend:

- THERAPY (I luckily found a very good therapist who was also an addict who got clean ) this has helped me more than anything to get to the root cause of my addictive behaviors and depression. 

- support groups (AA/NA) - doesn’t work for everyone but it is an option and can be very helpful to some

-Naltrexone - this is a medicine that blocks opioid receptors, it blocks the effects of kratom. During the first few months of getting clean this helped a lot because I knew that if I were to relapse , the kratom wouldn’t work . Just be careful with it - you will need to be off kratom for like 2 weeks before you start taking it . (Also make sure to get it from a psychiatrist and have them advise you)

-DO NOT GET ON SUBOXONE !!! If you see a psychiatrist they may offer this . The info on kratom in the psychiatry world isn’t really complete. Suboxone is far worse than kratom and harder to get off . 

-herbal (non addictive ) supplements for depression and anxiety (magnesium, chamomile, etc) 

wish the best to all of you! There is a light at the end of the tunnel .. it is just hard to see when your in an active addiction . But it is there . You will be so much happier without this awful plant .  It may not seem that way at first , but you just have to trust that after awhile - things will get better. 

TL/DR: 

during my addiction to kratom and other drugs - Got suspended from college, lost myself , pretty much went crazy with drugs/alcohol. Went to rehab, relapsed a bunch afterwards, was scarily depressed.Finally clean for a little over a year , feel like myself again and feel way more in control of my life .

I also take phenibut  and kratom (but I no longer feel anything from my dosage.) However, I did not tell her this. 

I was like great, the gabapentin and Naltrexone will help me knock out all these habits at once. 

I go home and pop a gaba and quickly after naltrexone. Literally within 10 minutes the most intense heat and fire started shooting through my body. I immediately began to lose focus and was uneasy on my feet. My muscles and bones were on fire. I then had the overwhelming urge to empty my bowels, and right after I was vomiting profusely to the point I was coughing and couldn’t catch my breath. 

At that moment it hit me. Holy crap, I’m in precipitated withdrawal from the Kratom. How could I be so stupid and not realize that would happen?

Quickly my world started going black and I ran to my bed and passed out. I would come to but could barely move or talk. The pain, burning, sweating, heat, and rls was unbearable. I was having hallucinations and talking in gibberish. I even got out of bed and ran straight into the wall. I was walking with my eyes closed. 

This lasted all night until the morning. Around 9am I realized the effects were slowly going away. It now 3pm and most symptoms are gone except for extreme fatigue and weakness. 

The good news, I was able to withdraw from kratom in a 12 hr window, but it is literally hell on earth. Way more intense and painful from quitting cold turkey.

2020-06-02 12:48:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/gvav4u/close_to_zero_gday/,Close to zero g/day,"Hey everyone!  So I figured I'd post because maybe it'll help someone.  I've had problems with alcohol in my recent past and have been sober for just over 2 years -- much of this exacerbated by PTSD from military service overseas (long story!).  At any rate, I found a lot of help in AA -- even though I never in a million years thought it would help.  I stopped going after being about 6 months sober, then recently, due to some upheaval in my personal life, was close to drinking again; so I went back.

This time I really decided to be honest with myself, and one thing I KNEW I was lying to myself about was the wisdom in my Kratom usage.  I've been using kratom for at least 3 years, started very reasonably, but, like almost anything else that makes me feel any different, it graduated to a 30-40g / day habit, some days maybe upwards of 50g, but rarely.  That's peanuts to some things I've read on here haha, but it's a lot for me.  Look, I loved kratom when I first started taking it.  I drank the head-shop kool-aide and thought to myself, ""Self, this is just  plant!  It's natural!""  Well, so is opium; so there's that.

Anyways, last wednesday I decided enough-was-enough.  I had my normal morning tea, about 6g strained, then went out.  First place I stopped?  Kratom bar, and ordered myself ANOTHER kratom.  After going to a meeting, I went back, ordered another.  Now we're at almost $20 on kratom tea's, and about 18g before noon.  Then, i came home and though, gee, I don't feel it 100%, maybe I should have some more?!  So, I grabbed a big old spoon and shoved a heaping tablespoon in my mouth and swallowed it down with some water.  I have no idea how much I had, but I do that OFTEN.  Maybe 10-12g more?  Well, no one saw me do that, so of course I can still have my regularly scheduled afternoon tea, another 6g more.

For some reason, going to an AA meeting made me think about my usage; and forced me to be honest with myself about it.  I felt a sincere feeling of shame -- knowing that I just keep lying to myself and that I""m just scared to stop.  So that day, I decided to quit.  I knew from perusing this subreddit that it wouldn't be easy, but I didn't know how hard it would or would not be.  I decided, then, to have three 3g strained teas a day -- and it sucked.  The first day my lower back started hurting and I thought I destroyed my kidneys.  The second day, it was even worse.  But, I didn't get the restless leg syndrome like I did when I tried to quit cold turkey.  I also wasn't floored with depression.  

My overall approach was to wait until I really, really needed it.  Normally I'd spoon some in my morning coffee - I didn't do that.  I waited until 11am each day to have the first 3g; and yeah, it sucked, but not that bad really.  And, my last 3g were always close to bed, around 11pm.  This helped take the edge off just enough to sleep.  I didn't eat ANY powder.  I have a theory that the powder is far stronger and much worse for your guts.  

Oh, I did have terrible GI issues.  Lots of stomach pain and diarreah, and radiating back pain.  I assume this is because my stomach was cramping up not having my regular deluge of kratom in it.  I quickly realized it didn't matter what I ate, so I decided to eat very well.  And I don't mean lean protien and vegetables -- I mean whatever I wanted to eat.  I was going to have those problems anyways, and I knew that, so I wanted to at least enjoy eating.  Nice steaks; eggs and bacon; big sandwiches; etc.

Since last wednesday, I've slowly lowered the amount I have each day.  I'm not on 1g 3x/day, and honestly, I probably could've not had my morning dose and been fine.  My stomach still cramps a bit, but my stool is somewhat regular.  My back pain is subsiding.  One thing that REALLY, REALLY helped was exercise.  It's a natural dopamine high, your subconscious KNOWS it's very, very good for your health, and it gets the blood and heart pumping regular again.  I've been doing the 'couch to 5k' program, and on off days I just do some simple body weight calisthenics in the backyard.

For the most part, beyond the stomach and back discomfort, and slightly being irritated at everything, I feel soo much better.  I'll never, ever go back to drinking Kratom.  At it's worst, it's all I wanted to do.  I was a total slave to it.  Tomorrow I'm going down to 0.5g 3x/day, and by Friday I'm done, for good, forever.  I'm really looking forward to getting back to regular life.  Keep your eyes on the prize; it does get better.

My taper was much faster, but I didn't want to drag this bullshit out, either.  I also know that from AA and from quitting alcohol, to 'embrace the suck', so-to-speak.  Every time my back hurt or I had to run to the toilet, I kept reminding myself that this is part of recovery -- this is how the kratom leaves.  Remember, it's just your brain.  There's no outside force making you feel like shit -- it's in your head, so embrace it, and when you're having cravings or discomfort, remember, this pain is you healing.

But I realize that Kratom wasn't the problem, the problem is me.

I have always seen myself as a sensitive tough guy, but the truth is I'm a nervous guy who masks it to myself like crazy.

I called my Dr., got a benzo prescription and it's helping me sleep. I have had benzo prescriptions before and walked away easily enough. This time I'm going to consider an SSRI if I have to.

I do everything under the sun to manage my pain, anxiety and sadness wholisticly. Yoga, weights, no booze, CBD and for the most part I'm ok, but I think Kratom helped with the final part. 

If it were part of a medically regulated program monitored by a practitioner of some sort I think it might be the beautiful thing we all thought it was, but it's like having heroin out there, freely accessible. Most heroin addicts are not street alley junkies, you would never know they're high. That's Kratom for you.

Like if I was in real fucked up pain a Dr might give me a pain med, temporarily. Ideally it would not bring euphoria, but I think many of us are in perpetual physical and emotional pain and so when we see not only that life is WAY better without pain and HOLY SHIT ""I'm not afraid, sad, thinking about suicide and am able to perform with the Adderall heads because of a plant!"" why wouldn't we be all in?

Self acceptance. It isn't fashionable. It isn't counter culture. It isn't tin foil hatted. Being honest with yourself isn't easy. And guess what? You're a moving target to yourself. 

One year you think ""I got this!"" Next year is ""what the fuck just happened?! I'm a piece of shit."" And fuck the year, that can happen day after day, week by week, minute by minute.

One of the best and worst relationships I had was with a guy who I suspect was high on Percocet all the time. I know he liked it, but I think it was pervasive. 

He grew a super successful company, makes millions of dollars, was super generous. But I gave of myself, I never knew how much because I had no sense of self worth. We both did. But he is ultimately a taker and a liar. So what's my point?

Well it was just like Kratom. I grew tremendously. I benefitted but there were major personal sacrifices. Know yourself. Know yourself. Know yourself. Your patterns will come out in all things across your entire life span.

Quitting Kratom is wonderful. It hurts but that's because we are hurt. It's wonderful because we learn more about ourselves when we are in pain than when we skate through life. 

Make no mistake, this is not meant to be a repeat lesson, this is your PhD in self understanding, but just when you complete your doctorate the real work begins. Life isn't easy. And I could easily criticize myself for sitting around and feeling sorry for myself, pan handling for sympathy but you know what? I was a dealt a good hand and life still is hard. Maybe you too.

Again,"This is gonna be a really long post.  I think a little backstory is necessary and I'm gonna start with it here, but if you just want to get to the point of this post, you can skip down to the FOURTH paragraph, excluding this one.

I've been a polyabuser for a long time.  I started with alcohol, which wasn't nothing too serious (drank every other weekend or so pretty heavily), and then I started abusing my ADHD medication, namely Ritalin but also Adderall from other people.  I went on like this for a long time, occasionally trying other drugs, mainly opiates, Benzos, dxm, and pretty soon, opiates caught on.  Before I actually started going nuts with opiates, I quit abusing Ritalin and Adderall which was pretty unpleasant to say the least considering how long I was using it medicinally and then hardcore recreationally, and opioids filled the hole amphetamines left.  A long time ago I successfully quit opioids and I was abusing a big concoction of hydrocodone, oxycodone, occasionally heroin (which almost certainly contained large quantities of fentanyl at times.  Scared the shit outta me so I kept abuse to a minimum and carefully titrated doses with each new batch), loperamide with Omeprazole, aka basically anything I could get my hands on.  I was going strong like this for about a bit over a year to a year and a half , and I decided to quit cold turkey.  I quit cold turkey off loperamide after using it consistently a few months before, and at the time I didn't read up on the hell lope withdrawals would be.  I occasionally went 3-4 days without heroin or oxy and those days were pretty much hell, but lope doubled down with it's withdrawals.  With oxy, I was crying in bed in a puddle of sweat throughout withdrawals.  With lope I was crying stuck on the toilet slipping around on the seat cause I kept shaking and was covered in a layer of sweat (tmi ik).  I had to keep a water bottle next to me to prevent severe dehydration and the first week I could barely eat from the nausea or sleep.  It was wild.  The second week things slowly died down although some physical symptoms continued for over a month before I relapsed on oxy.  I stayed on that for a month before quitting for good.  I stayed off opioids for 6 months, going on Benzos for a few months before quitting (it pretty hellish for just a few months) as well as trying cigarettes, which was something I picked up actually right before quitting off of oxy.  I ultimately quit cigs after working up to about 5 cigs a day and as for Benzos, I was using stupid amounts during those couple of months (some days I would just decide to take 10mg of lorazepam or some insane amounts of diazepam just for the hell of it even though I generally took much lower doses).  After six to seven months off opioids I relapsed for a week, taking hydrocodone for a while.  And that's when I discovered kratom...

Kratom to me was a ""life saver"".  It was way more euphoric in my experience than any other opioid could ever be and it made life seem great.  I went out and talked with people while on regular opioids I felt the need for socializing was taken away.  I exercised a lot, something I also did on opioids, but my endurance was definitely magnified even more.  Kratom took away back pain from powerlifting that opioids couldn't totally stop.  All of this with just coffee or SSRI like withdrawals...  I went on like this for a solid year and a half.  During that time, my energy and manic love of life slowly died down to the classic fatigue of opioid addiction magnified manifold.  Couldn't get out of bed to get food, shower, go to classes.  I was catatonic depressive and deeply addicted to something that numbed my humanity.  I was waking up each morning in withdrawals, much like I did with other opioids, but admittedly a lot worse, sometimes waking up at 4am, too anxious and depressed to fall asleep and too fatigued to dose my kratom if it was too far away from my bed.  I stopped talking to friends, rarely exchanging a few words as they would pass by me geeking out in my college dorm building hallway.  My quality of life was declining rapidly in ways that would make this post longer than it already is.  I wasn't willing to accept that kratom in any way played a part in this for some time, because I was buying into the online kratom bullshit so deeply with a gullibility fueled by my addiction.  Ultimately, the only thing that allowed me to realize the damage I was doing to the only life I had was a small trip on LSD.  It's surprising... God bless psychedelics.  I went cold turkey after two weeks or so...  That's when all hell broke loose.

The withdrawals came with all the physical symptoms of heroin withdrawals.  That was the first surprise to me that really shouldn't have been a surprise considering there were moments when I was without kratom for brief periods of time.  I had a runny nose, I was teary, yawning, physically aching worse than during withdrawals from other opioids, shitting my guts out, nauseous (not quite as bad as other opioids in retrospect), sweating with hot flashes alternating with intense chills, and covered in more goosebumps than ever.  Psychologically however, it is difficult to describe how much worse I was feeling quitting kratom than I was quitting any other opioid, any other drug, or really at any other point of my life.  I would much rather relive past traumas than relive a single hour of that nonstop torment.  I was uncontrollably crying with waves of deeply felt negative emotions and unavoidable thoughts that felt all encompassing coming at me in rapid succession.  I really felt like I was dissociating from this reality into a hell in my subconscious that I simply couldn't even imagine without the extra push of kratom.  I was also so fatigued that the simple act of shifting in bed felt like a brisk walk.  Walking to a shower hurt and worked my heart like a marathon and I was almost passing out.  With withdrawals from opioids and to a much milder extent ssris, you get a sudden resurgence of a wide range of emotions that opioids and ssris simply serve to numb, sometimes sending you into a crying fit, and other times leaving you on top of the world, living life how it's meant to be lived.  With kratom there was none of that.  Just a deep, existentially fatigued sadness and anxiety.  Half the time was also spent with these intense waves of terror, derealization and panic that would very suddenly well up in me, frequently paired with intense and sudden hot flashes or cold chills.  With how rapid fire my negative thoughts were, I was certain I was in some sort of state of psychosis by the peak of my withdrawals.  When I took a shower at some point, I drew some connection to a happy moment of my childhood playing by the water and how I tarnished my beautiful mind with my addictive behavior.  I very much felt I was 40% in my body, and 60% in that moment that I'm not even sure is real, although it felt almost more intense emotionally than reality.  It sounds almost trivial, but it's hard to describe just how intensely horrible I felt in that one moment.  I cried and screamed in my pillow to try to feel some form of relief.  With opioid withdrawals, crying was a release, and afterwards I felt a little better. With kratom, it didn't matter.  It would hurt harder.  By day three symptoms began abating.  I still had a lot of physical symptoms in milder form, but the mental torment was letting up.  However, the intense bouts of panic and terror would continue on for months.  I don't know if it was a ptsd type of thing or what the hell was going on, but even while getting treatment later on with Suboxone, I would occasionally get these intense panic attacks.  I ultimately relapsed on kratom a week into withdrawals, on a slightly lower dose although I worked my way back up to a dose close to my original one over the course of a couple weeks.  Cannabis helped a lot with the moments of panic that came occasionally while on the kratom, but I wasn't trying to go cold turkey.  I wasn't gonna try another taper because I experimented in the past with a kratom taper, and it simply wasn't meant to be.  I got on Suboxone, stayed on it for a while, then tapered off with relative ease over the course of several months.  It was by no means easy, but it was more doable than getting off kratom by literally any means.

I was technically sober for a while.  It's nice.  I got back on my ADHD medication without the intent to abuse them and it's helping me get back on track with school.  There really isn't an intent to abuse it when I use it orally and I'm not gonna go down the path of intranasal abuse for my own sake.  But something else came into my life again that I want to discuss.  Nicotine.  It comes with a gentle euphoria that's very clean, being neither as sedating as the euphoria of opioids and neither as overwhelmingly stimulating as the rush of some snorted Adderall.  I've been using it for several months now, just smoking half a cigarette or so whenever I get a break, smoking about four to five cigs a day at the moment.  There are some very mild withdrawals starting to reveal themselves, although it's definitely nothing I'm not able to handle, especially after the absolute unreal hell I went through with kratom.  Really they're currently just some mild anxiety after the high of going through a cig and some transitory anxiety in the morning.  But at this point, I'm definitely addicted to them.  I just always feel the need to be addicted to something.  While this provides me the perfect high, it comes with a very obvious risk: death.  Cancer is something that runs through my father's side of my family, and even though he's going on to 60 sometime soon and he smoked like a chimney in his younger years, I don't like the idea of testing my luck like that.  In the past ADHD medication actually really helped with this, but I feel like it's less effective currently.  At the moment however, it's very clear that that's not gonna cut it.  I've been with a therapist for a while, and while they provided me with many techniques that helped me through the kratom wd related panic attacks that I still occasionally get among many other things, I really feel like nothing can touch my tendency to get addicted to things.  If it's not nicotine, I really do worry I may go back to kratom which to me is an absolutely terrifying prospect.  At the same time, while nicotine isn't that bad of an addiction at the moment, I can imagine withdrawals becoming more of an issue with more and more cigarettes, and I simply pray I don't get to a point where I will actively avoid withdrawals. What tips do you have to halt addiction once and for all?  Literally any are welcome and greatly appreciated.

I wish y'all the best of luck on your journeys to sobriety.  Stay strong.  I swear that sobriety pays off in ways you can't imagine now.  If you read my backstory and related to anything, I would be glad to hear your own story.

Update: I have continued with my daily regimen of cigarettes, smoking about a third of a pack a day by now.  I don't feel any significant withdrawal symptoms yet besides some fatigue and mild irritability in the morning although I'm coming on my 4th month of relatively consistent smoking.  The kratom withdrawals I experienced every morning by four months at 20-25gpd were already a hell that well exceeds this in every department and I'm not by any means surprised.  I had a nightmare last night where I was back in my kratom withdrawals and it was scary to say the least.  I remember thinking ""oh fuck I did it again"" and I remember the waves of confused terror and depression that came over me although I couldn't feel them in their full intensity, besides the confusion which is inherent to dreams regardless.  Still horrible.  I'm thinking about doing a quick taper over the course of a week.  I've done this very successfully with cannabis which also had some definite withdrawals after a year of consistent heavy use.

It also worth noting that another symptom I experienced in withdrawals that I forgot to mention were these waves of paranoia that seemed to be vaguely related to my environment as well as the context of the disconnected thoughts I was having but it wasn't necessarily associated with my panic attacks.  I always had agoraphobia and a fear of the dark and being alone before withdrawals, but it was all magnified a hundred fold as if there was really something to be scared of in my dark bathroom.

Edit2: spent yesterday without ciggies.  Kinda tired n kinda cranky.  I slept a lot.  Gonna give complete sobriety another try.  Wish me luck.  Worst case scenario, I'm probably gonna fall back on cannabis, not because it's any healthier than smoking ciggies or something but I definitely need to smoke a much smaller amount, having had periods of time where I would savor a single .5g joint over a period of 3 days.  I definitely have a low natural tolerance cause after a longer break, a single puff off some top shelf shit gets me to a similar place that a beer can or so will.",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6201452}"

Been wanting to write my thoughts for a minute, gonna keep this short tho. Long history with being addicted to almost everything, at different junctions in life. Lots of opiate relationships. Cut the tie with all of them around 8 yrs ago. H was the worst. 

Took an unconventional approach to my taper. I was on about 30-40gpd. 6 yr k vet. Developed terrifying kidney and bladder issues. Started a month ago, and didn’t ever really measure anything. Just made myself take less and less each day. Got down to about 1.5 gpd after around 3 Wks. til a few days ago made myself skip a morning, the next day, skipped my mid day dose, next day nixed the evening dose. 

I’ve found myself yesterday waking up and not even thinking about kratom at all. Took one .5 dose before mowing just out of habit. Today took a .5 at 9am when work started, just out of fear and habit. Didn’t withdraw after it, didn’t even bother me much. Haven’t taken any or even thought much about it since this morning. It’s abt 11:30pm. I honestly feel pretty fine. Sort of focused and kind of happy? 

This is the weirdest thing of all for me. Waking up and just feeling normal. Not tormented. Not hurt. Not angry. Just normal. It’s fucking fantastic. But it’s feels so fucking foreign to me. I love it, but I’m scared shitless about it to be honest. It seems to good to be true that I could be actually feeling normal on my own. Not thinking about kratom. Not withdrawing 4-6 after touching kratom. 

Anybody else feel the same way? Like you love this person, but you’re scared of him? You’re strangely content, but kind of uncomfortable with how simple and natural it feels?

I was really busted up about it. Everything was going great and I ended up taking 8g that night. It was immediately a bad idea. 

Yet here I am, 3 days later, over that 1 event. Calling it day 11 and chalking the one night stand up to just that. Progress can only continue if we allow it. Being disgusted did nothing besides hinder that progress.

Went back to work today (after 2 month lockdown) and realised the kratom wasnt even necessary. All those years spent taking it for a boost when I already have what I need. Alot of the back pain I had also been using kratom for is even subsiding! 

Day 11 is going well. Spent the weekend with family. Also pulled out my keyboard and made a couple completed songs on abelton! Really nice to find joy without my old vice. 

PAWS is hitting slightly, that slogging-low feeling...but I've been good to distract myself from it. The physical withdrawells are gone, beyond GI stuff. Sleep has been much more normal than it was through WD. 

You can do it too :) and the support here has been great, but still I do think about the craving occasionally. This time knowing that the one relapse was only a hindrance....maybe it was a good thing as most of you said.

Find ways you can enjoy life without that crap, it gets alot better! Never, in the years of taking kratom, have I had as much fun with my family as I did last weekend. Nor had I been so motivated to make music. Sure it's a battle that will continue on, but without kratom I have to actually seek ways to find joy beyond intoxication. 

This is all in the process of stopping pot, alcohol, benzos, and cigarettes over the course of this year. Never have I been this sober in several years....and it's a shell shock. A much needed one at that. 

Heal yourself, pick up your old hobbies, and by all means reach out! Whether through reddit or to people you haven't talked to in years. So far my support systems have been very paramount to this process.

It’s not “amazing” or perfect...it’s just life. I have a new appreciation for enjoying mornings, normal sleep, natural energy, and looking forward to small things, because those were the biggest life joys I lost on kratom. I guess the one thing I’m still struggling with is relearning how to deal with stress. Every time something unpleasant comes up that I don’t feel like doing, my initial mental response is to get some kratom for a little pick me up. This is automatic and feels very different than craving it: I don’t need kratom or even want it, it’s more like an intrusive thought that is pretty easy to let go of. To all of you quitters who are worried you did permanent damage...you didn’t. I feared this too, but time is the great healer.
