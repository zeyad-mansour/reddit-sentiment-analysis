When did your hair grow back?,"Hi everyone. I quit taking pretty much all drugs and CT withdrew from 9 years of benzos and heavy alcohol. I did that on December 12 2020 and my life is... So much better. I'm working a job I like. Got registered to go back to school for a cloud computing program. I have totally turned around my life. I've grown more than like, ever? Probably like 15 years worth of growth in like 4 or 5 months lmao. I have goals and I actually set out to achieve them. I get it done and I just go go go. I go get it. I've lost nearly 40 lbs from a healthy diet and how much I've cut out from stopping drinking. But it's been extremely hard. I did start taking kratom and it wasn't a big problem. I was just trying to help myself deal with some of brutal withdrawals I was going through. Dear lord!! Anyway. I started taking the kratom sometime in late January and it did help a lot with my anxiety and helped me get out some. I really did not notice any bad side effects or any dependence. Then I SAW MY SCALP. WHAT?! I have always had extremely thick hair and this literally has made me so depressed. When I put the correlation together, I immediately stopped taking the kratom. This was I wanna say around five days ago. I have noticed that not as much is falling out anymore but my self esteem went from the best in years to totally trashed. It feels like heart break. I know how dumb that sounds. I know it will come back, but it literally has been keeping me AWAKE. I haven't slept in 2 days now. Idk if it's a combination of losing weight, and the extreme stress my body has gone through cutting out the benzos and alcohol. COMBINED WITH KRATOM. I know it probably isn't as noticeable to other people but I want to say I lost like 30-50 percent of my hair. I can't tell if I'm just freaking out or not. I know I'm rambling. But when did you guys start to see your hair come back? 😞😞
I've been so so proud of myself and I feel like I just got kicked in the fucking guts. Thanks guys.

Edit:no longer smoke weed either. Don't know if that's important. I have been microdosing mushrooms though mostly to promote neurogenesis. I also take Lion's Mane, Cordyceps, and Reishi. Not sure if any of that matters. I guess what I'm trying to say is I have been actively training my brain and taking supplements that seem to promote neurogenesis in an attempt to heal faster. It is working though. Releasing the repressed thoughts and learning new things eeep.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9848057627677917}"

I was taking up to 60 gpd towards the end of my 2 year addiction. Kratom turned on me overnight. My anxiety was so bad I thought I had ruined my life and was unable to enjoy anything again. 

The first few weeks were very up and down. I really started to feel better after about 3-4 weeks. If you’re quitting be prepared to only see minor improvements along your journey. I didn’t just wake up one day and feel like I do today. But almost every negative thing I experienced on kratom, and getting off it, has gone away or improved except for one minor thing. Towards the end of my use I developed a ringing in my ears after dosing. It’s definitely gotten better but isn’t gone. It comes and goes throughout the day, but I hope it’ll improve with time. If you’re quitting or thinking about quitting please remember it’s a marathon not a sprint. It’s very doable just don’t give yourself the option to backwards.",15,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9983164072036743}"

I called him every night with my dosage information I took during the day and what my plan was for the following day.

I started with 5 capsules every 1 1/2hrs and worked down from there. The beginning was the hardest part as I had lost track of how many I was taking during the day, was certainly more than my beginning dose. My dosage schedule from then until now looked something like this..

5 every 1 1/2 hrs (2-3days)

5 every 2 hrs (2-3days)

5 every 3 hrs

4 every 2 hrs

etc...

When I would move down, especially in the beginning I noticed some slight withdrawals. I didn't follow my plan perfectly, I stayed at some dosage level longer than others but tried my best never to dose more than my plan. I went all the way down to 1 every 8 hrs, or 1 capsule three time a day. I just took my final capsule. It's been a long road with kraydumb, going to AA meetings (I have addictions to other substances) and reading this thread on a daily basis has been very helpful.

Yeah I’m talking to you. Listen up. (In nice voice)

Just passed my 7 day mark here. And I wanna reach out to those in the middle of acutes who were probably feeling the same way I was for the past week. This is my third time quitting, luckily this time I was only using for about 5 months, at an average of 40-50gpd. Plain leaf, no extracts. Super rough week, BUT, certainly easier than last time (60-70gpd 3 years straight, to cold turkey, basically no comfort supplements), now that SUCKED.

I just want to provide some insight after this time around. Those who are in the thick of it. don’t worry. Do your best to be calm, accept the pain, accept the emotions, accept the discomfort, accept the insomnia. This is the price, and this is your body & brain healing. I’m sure I sound like a broken record, because of all the other threads in this FANTASTIC subreddit, but I took comfort in threads like this so I thought I’d put it back out there. 

Today was the 2nd day I was able to work- I took Monday-tues off, jumped off last Friday. I am a business owner/contractor/carpenter. My line of work does not make withdrawals easy. Luckily I’m the boss so I can take time here and there. What a luxury, last time I quit I was an employee and didn’t have such a privilege. 

Today has been my best day so far, I got about 6hrs sleep last night, was able to stay in bed all night without having several hot showers and without having to move to the couch. (Kept waking my wife because I was tossing and turning so much). I’m starting to feel myself again, and boy oh boy I was a sensitive f**king flower today. I broke down crying while driving to site because I forgot how much I enjoyed music- kratom has a way of numbing you and making you forget just how beautiful everything in life is. 

Acutes are tough, and I’m one of the lucky ducks that hasn’t experienced paws. I’m a recovering alcoholic, and I’ve been on and off kratom, but everything I’ve ever quit I’ve seemed to experience acutes then I’m back to normal. Even though acutes can be torture, be thankful and be present. Feel it all, because this is another challenge you will have defeated. It will just be another hurtle you’ve made it over in life, making you a better and stronger person. If you can quit kratom, you can do anything. 

Here is a list of what I’ve used for comfort this time around

Vitamin c- lots of it. Probably too much. 

Magnesium citrate- also lots of it, also probably too much. You should see my shits. 

Clonodine- doctor prescribed it without question, really takes the edge off in the evening and I believe it’s whats allowing me to sleep. Non habit forming, only taking it for a few days. 

Cbd/thc- I live in Canada where cannabis is LEGAL, and though I don’t smoke because it gives me mad anxiety, I’m able to take small doses of low thc/cbd oils. Allows my mind to ease up before bed. Makes a difference, as long as it’s not too much. 

Ashwaghanda- not sure how much it’s helping but my wife swears by it so whatever.

Black sled oil- was taking for the first few days, I believe it helped but it’s expensive and the recommended dosage for a man my size in withdrawals...couldn’t justify the cost. BUT it seemed to help.

Loperamide/immodium- no I’m not taking high doses, I’m taking the recommended and SAFE doses so I’m not shitting my pants all day. Those out there who are considering using it for withdrawal in high doses- do some reading, I have a friend who it nearly killed while he was getting off dilauded. Personally I wouldn’t fuck around with it, but I’m not gonna tell anyone what to do.

Kava kava- helps with my mood in the day, be careful though, Can be habit forming like anything else. I plan to stop using it from today on.


Last but not least, Compression bandages- I’m a weirdo and I don’t get RLS in my legs, I get RFS (restless forearm syndrome) lol drives me nuts while trying to relax but I tried wrapping my forearms in Medical compression bandages and it helps a lot. Just not too tight ladies and gentlemen. 

I hope this provides some comfort to some. It will get better, even if it doesn’t happen in 7 days, it will. Be present, accept it. Life is better without it. Look forward to being YOURSELF. Being real. Taking on reality raw, It’s better. 

Much love to all of you, keep those chins up, and push through. When it’s over and you feel better, don’t let yourself forget how you feel now. Don’t let it sneak back in like I have.

If you’re thinking of quitting but don’t think you have the strength, just know you do... I was you at one point with that same mindset.
If you’re thinking about having no future without Kratom.... man oh man! You’re going to excel.

There was a moment in life where we all didn’t use, it was kind of a clear, beautiful experience.

I’m glad to finally say that it’s possible to feel that way again.

Spent probably between $60-$100 a day on them for that length of time. As an ex-opiate addict I’ve had lots of experience with Suboxone. Now I know a lot of people are against switching from Kratom to Suboxone. I think the severity of your addiction has a lot to do with the decision to switch to Suboxone from Kratom. I first started with 2mg a day of Suboxone. It helped with the cravings for Kratom. I was able to take less Kratom. However 2 mg of Suboxone a day wasn’t enough. I was still craving the Kratom and taking it along with Suboxone. I recently bumped up to 8mg a day of Suboxone and have stopped the Kratom all together. I finally feel free. I’m not having cravings for Kratom. It feels good because I was wasting so much money to uphold the Kratom habit. This might be a good option for someone who can’t stop taking the Kratom extract tinctures/shots. My plan is to stay at around 8mg of Suboxone for about a month and then start to taper off. In the past I’ve tapered to such a small dose of Suboxone that I only had withdrawals for a day. My lowest dose was probably 0.01 mg before I stopped. I plan on doing the same thing again. As a side note for someone considering doing the same thing. There are absolutely no precipitated withdrawals. Zero. None. Nothing. You can take them both at once if you want to. They don’t have a bad interaction. Take your last dose of Kratom at night. Start the Suboxone the next morning.

I stopped CT in end of May2020 and the severe shedding continued for about 2 months, then it was over and even grew back so well. I thought the shedding was due to every day use, so I  tried taking Kratom again once a week for 2 weeks in Jan 2021. It was only twice and my hair started shedding almost immediately after the second time. I stopped again, but It has been way over 2 months this time. It’s been almost 3 months of shedding without taking any Kratom. Did anyone else experience this long of shedding ? I am wondering if it could be something else now since my first experience was way more kratom and only 2 months of shedding. 

I’m pretty scared that i’ll become bald :/ the first time I didn’t use any supplements, it just stopped and grew back. I feel stupid for trying kratom again, but I thought a tiny dose just once or twice a month wouldn’t hurt (since I wasn’t addicted just liked the energy)

I've used it for management of ADHD symptoms (certainly noy how well it used to but alas), used it to quit smoking and drink substantially less and it works quite well in those departments, but I can't remember what my energy levels looked like, what my baseline libido was, what my conversations consisted of. Im afraid I'll look to turn to the bottle or buy a pack of smokes or won't be able to perform at work as well as I need to because I believe I owe a lot of my professional advancement to Kratom.

My question is what's your Why? Why are you quitting? Or why did you quit? Why did you start in the first place and why do you want to go back to a clean lifestyle. Is there a good to bad ratio that you considered before taking the dive? 

This is a personal journey for everyone but it helps me to hear success stories, or failures, perhaps to hear that maybe quitting isn't all it's cracked up to be, or maybe it helps people put fingers to keyboard one more time to remind themselves why they started to keep them motivated, or everything in between.

I’ve never had a problem with anything. I’ve taken opiates as prescribed, liked the feeling if I’m being honest, but always took as I was supposed to and didn’t have any issue stopping when I wasn’t. Experimented with other random things in my youth, nothing ever struck me as something to do continuously. Going on 23 years in the Army, might have kept me from ever delving into anything. I drink, probably more than I should, but it’s more of a relaxation thing after my 5 kids are in bed having a glass of wine so I can chill out. I’ve never been an active smoker (until I started using Kratom) but I always liked to smoke when I drank, but never any other time. People always joke with my about that. I own and work at a bar where everyone smokes and I’m always invited out to have one but then someone says “oh that’s right you’re one of those weirdos who only smoke when they drink”. Every pregnancy I’ve never had an issue stopping drinking, smoking, even caffeine. In hindsight it was so dumb of me, but I legit thought that I could not get addicted to things. I didn’t understand how even if you don’t feel a NEED to do a drug, that your body can have other plans for you. I am needless to say, BUSY. Mom of 5, now in the Army National Guard after being active, and work full time at, and own, a bar. Not even beginning to count all the crap my kids are involved in. After multiple deployments etc. I have chronic back pain. It’s my fault, I can go to the VA for free, I can probably even get some compensation for it. I’m just not that type, I hate going to the doctor, and I just don’t have, or I should say make, the time to take care of myself. After I had my last child (who will be 4 in august). I was struggling to lose that baby weight at the gym and my back was killing me ALL the time. One of the bartenders at my bar told me I should try this “tea” she had. She said she just takes it once in a while for back pain. “It’s just an herb”. “Completely legal”. She made me some before my shift. Back pain over, not only that, I had ALL the energy. At first, I could get ANYTHING done when I would take some. Again this is my fault, I didn’t research kratom. I only took it that one time at first, I didn’t even know it was called Kratom. A few months later I was complaining about my back hurting and my friend said someone recommended taking Kratom so he bought some online from a reputable distributor but he didn’t like how it made him feel. He said “it gave him a head buzz kinda of like a pill buzz” and he didn’t like that so he’d give it to me to try. He told me “just take a tablespoon”. I now realize how dumb that was. A tablespoon of good potent stuff. I didn’t leave my body much choice than to build up a huge tolerance right from the jump. I took a tablespoon with water. Idk why but I never minded the taste. Never grossed me out. Just put it in some hot water, stir it up, chug it down, feel much better. I still, regretfully, didn’t do much research. I did read that you should take a day or 2 off, but shit, I don’t have a day or 2 off. I’m busy, I need to feel 100 every day. Oh I forgot to mention that in the midst of everything else were remodeling our house ourselves room by room as if we have the time. But I’m super mom, as everyone says, so I got this. And Kratom is helping. I think I was taking a tablespoon of good stuff 3 times a day. I didn’t realize it was an issue until my husband and I were getting ready to go to Vegas. I had to go away for the Army for the 4 days immediately prior. He told me maybe I shouldn’t take Kratom with me. I had told him that i thought it was starting to work less and HE read about it and told me that I was probably building a tolerance so to not take any with me. Okay cool, because I don’t get addicted to anything anyway right?! No big deal. I thought I was possibly dying. Luckily it was freezing and we had to be out in the rain and snow and on a range the entire time so nobody could tell how bad I was and just assumed I was sick. I didn’t sleep the entire time. As soon as I laid down I’d get this scratch in my throat that would make me uncontrollably cough  and I’m in a room with 50 other women trying to sleep so I’m awake trying not to cough. I got some Benadryl from the PX to knock myself out but then I’d wake up with the restless arms and legs, trying not to move because were sleeping on old AF metal spring arm cots. Hell. I didn’t sleep. My husband said from what he had read I’m probably going through withdrawal. Psh. Not me?! I started reading in my misery. Yep. I’m an idiot. I managed to sleep a few hours the last night and drove the 2 hours home super relived to be feeling better and to be going home to go on our trip! I should have never touched it again. Instead I chugged one down immediately after walking in the door, felt 100% better, and was able to get packed and ready to catch our flight. I was still tired so I took it with me to Vegas but I was trying to do it only once a day to be smart(er). But now I’m having restless legs every night. I assume because I didn’t finish riding my body of it and now my body is pissed that I’m not giving it what it’s used to. Now we’re back to 3 times per day. Also I started smoking all the time. Idk what it is about it, makes me want to smoke? Now I’m realizing what I’m spending. The online distributor that I was buying from, is one of the most expensive out there. I’m blowing so much money this is just dumb, my husband agrees. Then he tells me “you know they have Kratom at the corner store”? Like a fraction of the price. Now we’re in business. I can afford this habit. Although it’s not the same, it’s shitty. It doesn’t feel the same, it doesn’t last as long. But I still feel it and now I need it. I need it for my back, I need it to wake up, I need it to get me through my crazy days of working nights then taking care of the kids all day so we don’t need a sitter, I need it to work all night after no sleep, I need it to go to sleep and sleep all night. At one point I found out I was pregnant after I’d started using the cheap stuff. I quit CT for 5 days and it wasn’t that bad. Nothing like the first time. The only thing I can think is that the cheap weak stuff made my tolerance go down and had me unknowingly taking less. Then I had a super early miscarriage. It happens. Was it because I had been taking Kratom, idk?! But I was down, so naturally, needed my pick me up. Fast forward to a few months before the pandemic started. Now I’ve been using this shit for almost 2 years. It gives me energy, but no motivation to do things. I found out I’m pregnant again. I could not bear the thought of stopping. I tried for one day and couldn’t. I’m working basically 3 jobs, running kids everywhere, working nights to save on childcare, and adding the tiredness of pregnancy. I will die. I started a 2 month taper because I was scared to do it faster. I was beat. I got almost to the end, and I had a miscarriage at 12 weeks. Was it my fault. I still feel guilty. About 2 weeks later I got super sick. All the signs of covid but they weren’t testing yet. After that I was exhausted. I was just taking Kratom to keep going. I didn’t even want to. Felt like I HAD to. A week after I got sick the bars shut down and then a stay at home order was invoked. I started being super flaky. The pandemic didn’t help. We COULDNT do anything so I didn’t notice that I had become a flake. The kids couldn’t do activities. We couldn’t plan trips. Didn’t have appointments. I was getting a ton of remodeling  done because I couldn’t work or do literally anything else. Everyone always said I was super mom. The kids were in every activity. I was super involved in their schools. We did fun stuff every weekend, fun trips, fun activities at home. I’ve always prided myself on being an awesome mother. After the pandemic started to lighten up, I had to go back to work. Kids started school. Activities opened back up. They’re in none. They could be. I just haven’t set it up. I have like no motivation or brain function or concentration to get the shit done that I KNOW that I NEED and WANT to do. I’ve been saying for 6 months that I’m going to make us dentist appointments tomorrow since we missed some during the pandemic. Now it’s been way too long I’m embarrassed. My friends want to go places, i blow them off. My husband is lacking intimacy and my interest in general because I have none to give which until now I didn’t realize was probably past of the Kratom. I’m like an empty shell of myself. I come back in waves, short lived. Fast forward to 2 weeks ago. My husband mentions that shouldn’t I be on my “monthly”? Shit. I’ve been telling myself since the last miscarriage, over a year ago now, that I had to quit if we wanted one more before we’re “too old”. I just keep pushing it off. Scared little weak idiot. In hindsight I have some signs of another issue that may be the reason for the miscarriages but since I’m the flake of the year I still haven’t mustered the gumption to go get it checked out and fixed. The thought of taking the kids somewhere to be watched, making the arrangements, etc feels EXHAUSTING. So now I’m knocked up again. Haven’t quit this dumb habit that isn’t even helping me anymore, haven’t gotten checked out by my doctor. I don’t even know how I’m getting pregnant since my drive has ceased to exist. Somehow at nearly 40 we are still super fertile I guess. I tried for a week to taper down. Felt like shit, wanted to sleep all day. I have too many kids to feel like shit for that long during a taper. My husband has been working out of town so I’ve been on my own. Couldn’t do it. Thank God he still loves me somehow. I told him I needed him to come home and not work the weekend through Tuesday. I am done. I want to be the person and partner and mother that I really am, again. I tired of people still talking about what a super I am but knowing I’m flaking out on my kids too. I would do anything for them. This is no different. He came home. He has a big work ethic and didn’t want to miss work, but he did. And I actually did break my foot days before I quit CT so I had an excuse to not work for a while. Luckily, Although nobody knows, I have a pretty decent support system for if I need time off. I don’t know how you guys are doing it and working. The first 3 days were horrible although not as bad as I expected compared to the first time I experienced the withdrawals after only a short time of using good stuff. Only thing I can think is that the stuff I’ve been using is so crappy that I wasn’t taking as much as I thought I was. It’s still in the house. Husband takes it occasionally for pain etc but never to excess and goes weeks without. I have no cravings for it. What I crave is sleep. Craving some energy also, but I can deal with that for a bit. 11pm tonight will be 6 days since last dose. Obviously took it at 11pm so slept fine the first night but since then I don’t think I’ve sleep more than an hour per night. I’m staring at the ceiling wide awake but exhausted and then when I finally pass out, I wake up 20 minutes later with restless arms legs crawling. Almost all other symptoms have subsided.  

Wow I started writing this just to ask when you all started to get SOME sleep. I must have needed to vent my story for some sort of therapeutic release since I’ve been too embarrassed to tell anyone else. I’ve never needed a lot of sleep, even before Kratom, but I do need SOME. I’m getting seriously none and it’s sort of somehow more exhausting trying to sleep and not being able to. I’ve tried Benadryl, Passion flower, melatonin, tea... I’m then exhausted, drowsy, with restless legs so can’t sleep. How long did the restless legs continue for you all? I know it’s only been 6 days, and I am and will survive. I’m just curious. I can deal with the insomnia but the RLS is such a mind f*ck for me. I shouldn’t even be complaining. I’m off work, I had 4 days of no responsibility to get thru the bad. I’m lucky. But I just feel like a shit being so sluggish with the kids and laying around all day. Plus I do have to get 3 to and from 3 different schools and keep the littles alive all day. Maybe I just need some time frames from you to make me feel better so I can have an endpoint in sight. I realize the affects go on for a long time for some. I’ve had anxiety my entire life so I’m no stranger to that, I can deal. I can be depressed. What I can’t be is stretching all night losing my mind. 

Any responses so appreciated. Or ideas to help. I know it’s different for everyone. I’ve read all the stuff. I’m prepared to endure. Knowledge just makes me feel better. 

Thanks in advance for listening. I guess I needed to talk. Congratulations to all of you who have quit and are quitting. We will be okay, and better!

I remember obsessing over how much better my life would be after I make it through a whole week. I have to be honest I can't deny anymore I'm getting better. It's really noticeable to me, my family, and my girlfriend. Ever since day 2 towards the end of the day I would get about 1-2 hours of relief from the crippling anxiety and depression. Everyday that little bit of relief has been a bigger and bigger part of my day. I have been able to laugh and enjoy time with myself and my girlfriend. I can eat and enjoy solid food. Working out is feeling more and more beneficial to my everyday life. The anxiety, depression, and fatigue become more and more manageable every day. My mind is becoming less foggy. Sleep is getting easier and more frequent. I'm starting to get glimmers of hope about getting back into the things I loved most in life. I'm starting to accept that this is a journey and it's far from over. Kratom has taken a lot from me, this time more then the last. I threw away friends, quit my job so I could use more kratom, and had to drop out of school because life was so debilitating. I have plenty of trauma that has been pushed aside the last few times I got sober but this is not the end. My school knows that I relapsed and they want me to come back as soon as I'm ready. The director is actually a recovering addict who's 27 years sober and I know it hurt him to see me like this. I can always get a new job and if I'm being honest if I went back to my old job and told them what happened they'd probably take me back in a heart beat. Although I threw away my friends and lied to my girlfriend they never gave up on me. I'm getting help from my girlfriend, a doctor tomorrow, and an addiction counselor. LIFE WILL GET BETTER, I just have to take it one step at a time.

I've tried to quit DOZENS of times. Dozens. In over 4 years I've never made it this long. I was terrified I never would. Man, do I feel great. 
I've been getting on this forum for well over a year. Its what motivated me to try again. I can't thank you all enough.  I'm getting teary just typing this because my emotions are returning after being dead for so long!!! Hallelujah!!
Like most of you who come here, I was always looking for that magic supplement that would help diminish the suck that is the 1st 72 hours (at least) of kratom WD. I've tried HTP-5, black seed oil, multi vitamins, ashwaganda, green tea extract, passion flower extract, turmeric, you name it, I tried it. BUT VITAMIN C THOUGH!!!!! THAT was the game changer for me. I started taking 2000mg of vitamin C every few hours the day before I jumped, and have been taking 2000mg every 2 hours since, and WOW. I've slept 8 PLUS hours since I quit. I had MILD RLS night 1, woke up to it around 7am yesterday, took 2 more Vit C and my RLS was gone within 10 minutes and I got another 3 hours of sleep.
I have actually slept better since quitting cold turkey than I have in weeks. The last time I tried to quit I had insomnia so bad I didn't sleep at all for three nights and that was at a steep taper not even cold turkey! The only difference is the Vitamin C.
Has anyone else had crazy results with Vitamin C like I have? I'm seriously blown away by how minimal my WD has been. It's freaking me out actually, it makes no sense at all!!
Good luck to you all, and try Vitamin C! I do take .1mg of Clonidine and passion flower extract right before bed as well.

From that first scoop I was hooked and haven’t had a day where I didn’t take it until yesterday. I have had issues with opiate addiction in the past so it’s really no surprise that this happened and I’ve definitely felt like a fool to even try kratom hearing rumors that it was like a legal opiate in high doses. I got up to over 30 grams a day for about 2 months. All together I did kratom for 5 months, no days off. I tried to quit cold turkey. TERRIBLE IDEA. Really if your taking a significant amount of kratom don’t try to quit CT. Taper! I tapered down every 3 days I’d lower the dose. At first I slashed 2 grams every 3 days and as my dose got under 8 grams I lowered by a gram a day. There was no real reason to that except that it wasn’t too excruciating and it kept me motivated by lowered everyday at the end. Last night I got some really awe full sleep and yesterday and today I’ve felt pretty agitated but it’s nothing compared to trying to quit CT. I felt a massive wave of depression trying to quit then, body chills and sweats... it felt like I was kicking Vicodin again, actually worse to be honest. I know 100% I’m not out of the weeds at all but I also know that I’m going to be able to quit this time and I’m not touching that green sludge ever again. Maybe some can handle it and not be consumed by it but I’m for sure not one of those people. Remember if you’re thinking about kicking kratom, create or look up a taper plan and stick to it! I’d even say if you continue to lower because it’s unbearable just make a rule to NOT INCREASE your does. Hang out on a set amount until you’re ready to continue to taper. This will make quitting so much easier. I wish anyone getting ready to kick kratom

The first three weeks were amazing, besides the week of physical acutes. I assume what I was going through was the pink cloud. I felt great, so much energy, I felt alive again. Fast forward to today, and I feel like I'm losing my mind. I'll tell you why. 

Right at about the end of the third week, I had a situation happen (direct result of poor choices I made while using K) that SKYROCKETED my anxiety. It was a one and done deal, and I did move on from it, but when the anxiety hit it was Like a train. It took 4 hours to make it diminish. I thought that was it, a one time anxiety experience. But it's like that one event opened a door. Ever since then, I've been beyond anxious 24/7. I can't think straight. I've got a lot going on in my personal life and Ive been working almost 60 hours a week for the last month (convenient that I chose to quit during such a time) and I'm making SO many stupid mistakes. They're dumb but they're happening consistently, multiple times a day, every day. Ive gotten to this point where I can't even figure out what's wrong with me or why my head is like mashed potatoes. I locked my keys in my car yesterday and broke down crying. Im exhausted. 

At this point, I think it's time for me to see a doctor and go to therapy. I've got a lot a baggage, for being almost 22 I've been through a lot. And through all of it I was using some form of substance, from a 4 year opiate addiction, to a year of flirting with meth, Molly, cocaine and pills, to 2 1/2 years of kratom. I can't do this by myself anymore or Im going to snap. 

The weirdest thing is I still feel.. me. Ive had a social life for the first time in years, I've started seeing friends again. Im happy- dont get me wrong. I find joy in small things every day. But lately it seems like my head is in a constant state of chaos, and I don't even realize it's happening until I'm going through the result of whatever mistake I made, due to my mental state. I don't know. Im at a weird spot right now. I needed to vent. Im gonna start looking into places here soon. I know it will get better, but at this point I need outside help or Im going to break.

Went to my doctor that day and laid it all out for him, got Lisbon (I think it was called) for the withdrawals but just made me a zombie but it helped for a few days, I had no idea what awaited me for the next 5 days though. Extreme anxiety and mood swings, no sleep and RLS was extreme. Come to find the gabapentin I was prescribed helped with the RLS so that was welcomed. Only took it for a few nights though because it makes me sleepy af and don’t need a new addiction. I’ve had cravings here and there but mostly over that shit. Anxiety still comes but less and less every day. I’m feeling emotions and getting my energy back more by the day also. The lack of energy and leg weakness sucked but I’m about 90% back. Dealing with stress like a competent adult again instead of thinking I could just take K and it would fix it. Not so much. I think my bad experience was a blessing in disguise though, been trying to find a way out for years now.

I didn't know about these forums the first two times trying to quit, now its my third time(6 days kratom free) and everyones stories have really helped, I feel like I have a whole group of people that have gone through or going through the same thing as me, even though I don't know any of your names or faces, but  I feel like I'm not alone.. I was doing the best I ever have in my life 2+ years ago before this kratom journey started, I finally started working out regularly, moved to a new house, started socializing more. now two years later I'm doing the worst I've ever been, because of kratom. the first six months wasn't horrible, I only let myself take it at night when I got home, but after six months of that I started to notice I was just trying to get through the day so I could get home at night and drink my kratom, after six months of that I decided to quit, the first time quitting wasn't horrible, the first 2-3 days I just felt like I had a bad head cold, runny nose, headache, no energy(all physical,no mental issues) but after 3-4 days I was feeling better, after 5-7 days I felt normal again. stayed off it for about a month, then did the typical ""I'm over it, I can go back to doing small amounts and not let it effect me"", started drinking it again but this time I wasn't working as regularly so I let myself drink it during the day and more and more of it, to the point where Id exchanged my morning coffee for my morning cup of kratom, id take it 2-3 during the day just to feel normal, then at night id drink 2-3 cups in a short amount of time, to the point where I was barfing and numb to everything, I was drinking like 50-60 capsules a day ( one of those small 20$ bottles, id break the capsules open and mix them with water). after about a year of wasting my life doing that everyday I quit again, this time was a lot different, I quit cold turkey and was the hardest thing of my life, I felt like id never feel happiness again, panic attacks thinking about how much of my life I've wasted, relationships I've ruined, all the feelings kratom made me numb to hit me hard, this time it was a lot more mental. I went through the first few days of physical pain, but for like a week it was a mental battle just to get to a decent place, then week two and three got better, and was almost fully recovered and I started back up again :(, same as last time, started drinking it all day again, to the point I had to have it to feel normal, except I was the farthest thing from normal, wasted my life for about six months to a year again.  then about 3 months ago I realized i have to quit, for my family, for my friends, i cant be who i used to be while on this stuff, its changed me. so the last 3 months I've been trying the tapering trick, tapering can be hard unless you have a lot of self control, id do good for a week or two then go back to my old full dose, its been a long enteral battle for the last three months but finally got my tolerance levels down a bit and quit almost a week ago, its been a bit easier then the second time, I think tapering can help if you can do it. I'm starting to come out of the kratom fog and feel what life feels like again, and its great, and you can't feel it while dosing kratom, you may think you are but really youre just tricking and numbing yourself. I've spent 30mins to an hour a day reading everyones stories on here for the last 5 days, and I think its really helping, before finding this forum I've been battling this alone because I don't have the courage to tell my loved ones I need help(even tho I'm sure they know by how faded and zombie like I've been the last year or so, I can tell they know I'm not the same person as 2 years ago) and maybe writing this will help me from going back again, and in turn hopefully help someone else realize you're not alone, and you are stronger then kratom, and you can beat this and everything will get better from here on, maybe slowly but some things take time, but IT WILL GET BETTER, YOU CAN DO IT, I believe in you :), love you all, thanks everyone that read this, and posts there stories for people to get perspective and courage to fight to better themselves. life is a lot better without kratom",18,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9975425004959106}"

In the past month or so I have been getting nauseous every single day for some reason. I have not increased my dose of kratom. If anything as time has gone by I have lowered if from an outrageous amount to a only slightly large amount.

But have any of you heard of this? After a long time of being fine taking it, all of a sudden being sensitive to it?

I googled it of course but you know what comes up; that it can lead to a combination of symptoms that you would expect from both heroin AND meth and so of course I am nauseous.

I also have a pain under my left rib cage that I am told is where my stomach is. It is just sort of a dull annoying pain that makes me want to press on it to see if it will hurt more if I do. It generally does not hurt more if I press it.

I should also say, as much as I don't want to make you overlook the Kratom, I have also been taking phenibut daily for about a year. I know that is not smart or reccomended It just was what it was. So it is also a possibility that it is the phenibut that has started to make me nauseous.

At this point I have lowered the doses on both and plan to wean myself off, but any words of wisdom, and maybe not judgements, would be super appreciated right now.

For now I am lowering the dose on both the kratom and tthe phenibut. And yeah I know I should make a doctors appointment I just really do not want to tell her I have been taking what she thinks if as legally ambiguous narcotics",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9986112117767334}"

So after 4 years of using kratom everyday, I decided to quit 10 days ago. What's interesting is that the physical withdrawal doesn't bother me that much, but the mental aspect is constant.

I didn't realize it until I experienced something else, the brand of which was also new, and terrifying: withdrawal. Cold sweats. Mania. Anxiety.  Restless legs and arms, the blood in my body replaced by potent shock waves, like sticking my fingers and toes through an electric socket. And not stopping. It intensifies at night. It gets louder when you lay down.

I called in sick to work. I had to lay horizontal, save for the manic episodes where despite my now 48 hours clean system, I felt wracked by drugs. For a single moment I could see myself from the outside looking in, my eyes wild and wide, pacing in tiny circles in my kitchen, and repeating to myself ""Holy shit. Holy shit. I can't do this. This is insane."" I was reminded of the many souls I've seen on city streets, babbling to themselves, visibly agitated and fueled by some delusion-inducing poison.

So this is what that's like. A sliver of it, anyway.

I reached for the pills in the kitchen, hands shaking. Cold turkey wasn't worth a visit to a padded room. I'd take just a couple, to take the edge off of lunacy.

But it couldn't be that fast. The stomach pains had finally become too unbearable.  I turned on the tea kettle. Dissolving the powder would make it so there were no knives in my stomach in the hours to come. I had once happily tolerated that pain for the energy, for the euphoria. But my body could not take any more.

But peace visited me, and by the time the water boiled, my mania had subsided. I walked out of the kitchen, and turned on Schitt's Creek, and didn't turn it off until the finale.

And so the days passed. I read every post I could find here, on r/quittingkratom. I had become a sudden convert from the other subreddit about kratom, and instead of researching doses and strains and which intake methods would decrease the stabbing in my stomach, I read stories and encouragement from people who had experienced what I had. Feeling invincible, unstoppable, more confident than ever. At first. Then weight loss. A sudden change in my menstrual cycle that broke away from the rhythm my body had established at 12 years old. Worries about hormone and thyroid disruption.  Dependent physically and mentally on something that was supposed to be as harmless as a, well, a plant. Oh. And the hair loss. Alopecia areata. One dime sized bald spot near my left hairline. And another bald spot that cut my right eyebrow short. That is really the thing that brought me here.

And here, this community, is how I knew I could do this. It's how I knew I couldn't go on wishfully thinking that my body deterioration had nothing to do with the drug that had made me feel so good. It's how I knew about Hyland's restless leg pills, which gave me at least some hope of a few hours of sleep. It's how I felt comforted that I was not alone. It's how I managed to get myself outside to walk and even run in the days that followed, knowing that moving my body would help, not hurt.

I think otherwise I would have been too delusional or too frightened to do it. Otherwise, I would have been lost.

I take roughly 250mg a day and the back pain, the nausea, the chills and poor temperature regulation are almost immediately g o n e. This stuff works wonders. Give it a shot if you are planning on going cold turkey, or planning to taper, and it will help immensely with withdrawal symptoms.
Just for reference I've gone from 30 g a day to 6 g a day (today) on a .5g reduction per day. Agmatine has helped with mood, pain, and chills.",2,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9927762746810913}"

I started using kratom around 5 years ago and graduated to daily use over the course of a year.Last year I was able to go away from home for 2,5 months and used that opportunity to quit all drug habits I had at the time, I've been clean from everything for over a year now except for kratom, I ordered a bag within the first week of coming home ""to use once in a while"" and very slowly went back to using daily again.  

My habit is only around 1,5 grams once or twice a day now and I take at least 1 day a week off since kratom makes me irritated towards others and I refuse to dose when I'm going to see my girlfriend because I don't want her to experience me like that, but on other days I pretty much slog through work, my education and working out just so I can get home and dose.I don't even really have withdrawal symptoms when I don't use, I just don't have any motivation to do things without kratom and all things I enjoy (playing drums, reading etc) became things I do on kratom and now its like I can't enjoy them without kratom.  

I'm going on vacation next week and I decided I'm not taking any kratom with me so I can quit again, this in itself doesn't worry me but I'm so scared that when I get home I will just start craving it again like last year, since in my head all I want is to taste that 1 hour of motivation followed by inescapable boredom until the next dose.  

I'm just so clueless as to how to escape this, I can recite the NA program from the back of my head by now but nothing makes staying away from kratom any more bearable, how did you guys stay clean?  ",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9980655312538147}"

I only recently started measuring in grams, so not exactly sure how much I was taking during that time. I measured in tablespoons, but now I see how inaccurate that is depending on how tightly it’s packed or if it was a rounded tablespoon. 

The past couple months I’ve been taking about 10 gpd on average. I cut down to about 3 gpd about 10 days ago. I was going to do CT but had no idea how hard the WD would knock me down so I decided to taper and start back at a much lower dose. It took about a week to get used to the 3 gpd. 

The past few days I’ve gone down to 2.8, 2.5, and 2.5. Today was the second day at 2.5 and I’m still surprised by how I feel 2 days after such a small cut. It’s nothing like the big drop, but I woke up with a killer headache at 6am and have felt blah all day. 

For those people that tapered, is it normal to feel WD like that with such minimal decreases? Do smaller cuts in dose make a bigger difference when you’ve gotten to a small dose like 3 gpd? Not sure if that makes sense. 

I’m surprised I had such big withdrawals in the first place because I thought I was taking a lot more than I was until I got the scale. But, I have literally not missed a day in over a year (except the two days I tried CT last week) so I’m sure that has a lot to do with it.

Why we quit and why we won’t return to the green demon:

We scheduled our entire day around dosing... can’t walk the dog or go to the store or go out with your husband/wife without being properly dosed. 

We freaked out when going more than a few hours without a dose—especially when a stash wasn’t nearby. 

We hid it from family and friends, or at the very least, prioritized it over them. 

We lived in a blunted mental state. A constant layer of fog hung like a veil in front of our eyes. 

We destroyed our clothes with green stains and made excuses for how they appeared.

(Clonidine / Wellbutrin / Taper),"So I finally came clean to my psychiatrist about my 3y 60-70gpd habit (was doing 30-35 capsules, 4x). First he had to yell at me for a bit for not letting him know because the Wellbutrin he's got me on for depression could have easily caused serotonin syndrome (good to know!). But then, like a good doctor, he said ""okay, so let's get you better"". He can't prescribe the heavy stuff - but I am getting in with people who can.

I've managed to get myself down to about 30gpd (3 x 20 capsules with the occasional ""whoops"") but anything below that was just impossible. I couldn't take it. The sweats, the anhedonia, the roller coaster body temperature, the constant desire to run towards the nearest living thing and kill it... 

So we're trying plan A. Plan A is a 4 week taper plan using Gabapentin 3x daily and Clonidine 2x daily. We've got 3 'phases' or weeks where we drop from 30-20. 20-10. 10-5. 5-0. One more week on the meds, tapering those down, too. 

If that DOESN'T work we're going to switch to buprorenorphine. And if that doesn't work? (CUE FOREBODING MUSIC) my doc thinks it's time to just go in and detox inside. 

I've quit this crap before and it sucks. I've never had an opioid problem - I have certainly snorted my share, but I have certainly known a lot of people who've had to kick and it sounds absolutely miserable. And the people I know who used kratom to taper off opioids all generally said ""it's similar but nowhere near as bad"".  I have certainly quit all kinds of things before, including this. It's just this time the numbers are all higher.

I have nothing to add to the conversation other than I guess I should feel guilty for taking the most pansy-assed route when I should just sack up and grind out the two weeks. But I don't have the time - and just because work HAS to give you the time for medical, they're going to be thinking about how to replace you the second you leave.",8,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9984285235404968}"

I will start my taper tomorrow, I am getting myself ready. I have been having a weird experience with the kratom I had just gotten, it is green horned powder maeng da... It does not really get me high, but makes me feel kinda drunk and dizzy... I have to take a small amount of it, to not do this, but just gets rid of the withdrawals... not sure what's going on, but I figured I can use this to taper better and take the jump to get off of this.

So my plan is take away my day dose, and keep my night dose so I can still go to sleep. I am planning on doing this for 4-5 days then to jump from kratom ad use xanax for the first two nights to still be able to sleep.

Supplements I will use: (ask your doctor before taking, don't take if your on an SSRI).

1. agmatine   500mg (every 4-6 hours)
2. strong NMDA antagonist (every 6-8 hours) 30 mg of D - X - M
3. magnesium 400mg daily + epsom salt soaks.
4. black seed oil + vitamin C.

If anyone could explain the weird kratom effect, that would be great to know. I think it is tolerance with maybe just taking too much, but I would usually feel something. I want something consistent and not all over the place, especially when my tolerance drops. I would again feel dizzy, a lag feeling, super brain fog, hard to perform tasks, with no or very little high feeling. It does get rid of withdrawals when taken.

also this is the 8th time of me quitting, the last 2 times were recent, I just can't get anything out of the different kratom I get, and I have been wanting to quit for some time. I am taking a range of 50g to 10g of kratom based on the weird effects of the kratom... but before I started to get weird effects on kratom, I would be around 15-20g of kratom a day. Been doing kratom for 3 years now, did quit once for 2 months, so I know I can do this!

I will keep an update on my experience, If you are starting to quit feel free to follow along!

Edit: The reasons for not being able to kick the habit well, is work, my work is very demanding and having a once in a lifetime opportunity with making an AI company... so reasons why it has been hard, but should be fuel to motivate me more to quit.

4/28/2021: Ok so  took 1/2 of my morning dose, had  to get some stuff done at work. I still got dizzy, which really sucked, but its whatever. I am in mid withdrawals, but taking my supplements has reduced  the withdrawals a lot. I just hope there is no contaminants in the kratom causing the weird side effects. The withdrawals are stronger then usual, so that's fun, but doable. I might get a different batch from another place tomorrow or on saturday.

21 days ago I jumped after a remarkably slow taper. Honest to god it feels so much longer than 21 days ago, kratom is so far from my mind. Brain fog, I have read about it on here, but had no idea I had been experiencing it. Well I must have, because it is GONE, I have a clarity that I haven't felt in literally over a decade. Tinnitus seems to have gotten worse, but I only notice it at the end of the day and I know that will go away soon enough. Not so bothersome with a fan going at night to fall asleep.

Panic attacks are almost a thing of the past. I do still have them once a day, but it's only once, and it's only at night when I am trying to fall asleep (worst time for it, I know). But that kind of makes sense. With all of the drug use I have done over the last 15 years, I think this is the first time since the very beginning I have been going to sleep sober (relatively, I'm still tapering off my tiny dose of benzos, but I take it 8 hours before I go to bed for the night, and I think the taper off the benzos is going a thousand times better than the taper off of kratom). So this is probably going to be a thing for me for quite some time, but I tend to fall asleep pretty quickly, even though it feels like my heart is beating so hard I'll never be able to fall asleep. Remeber, EXERCISE people! Even if you don't want to! I just worked damn near 12 hours and still beat myself to hell on an hour long bike ride.

When I first started taking kratom, my main reason (other than to get off of narcotics and help my back pain) my MAIN reason is that it would (very briefly) boost my enthusiasm and motivation for some activity to look forward to doing in the future (mostly video games and new TV shows) making my hard work day more manageable because I was stoked to take kratom and do those things I have been thinking about all day. Now that I am off of kratom, I am finding that I am organically getting excited and motivated to do things on my own without kratom, a new first for me. 

I still have quite a ways to go in the healing process I think. Couple things... tons of people say getting off this drug is 90% mental, and tons of people saying every day gets a little better. Those are the two things I am coming to understand more fully as I encroach a truly sober life. The hardest part for me is the mental aspect, which I surprisingly am finding myself much further along than I thought I would be at this point. Oddly enough each day I get further away from my quit date without taking it, it's like my brain is relearning how to handle each individual scenario of each individual day without falsely convincing myself it's going to be fine because I took kratom. I can honestly say these have been the most stressful days of my job (part of why kratom became so much of a crutch for me), and honest to goodness I definitely don't feel like getting through it is harder now without kratom. I thought it was helping me through the stress, and I had no idea how wrong I was. My life is entirely NOT different without kratom. It's just the withdrawals and PAWS that make us think we can't handle it, but we most certainly can!

I’d figure I would share and then follow up with some questions  for those who are further along than I.

I would drink the powered with a quarter juice bottle of OJ and water , I don’t really have a quantity because I didn’t measure , I would just take four table spoons , sometimes more when I was feeling froggy.

I decided  to stop because I actually got sick  with a fever and chills so i naturally stopped. 

Day 1 -3: I was hyper sensitive to air which was really the best part . It felt like a come down from other substances but I enjoyed it. I was always cold and could not regulate. I also had the worst nights sweats , it was to the point I had to dry off with a towel and change . The fatigue was there but I was also slightly sick so It was not too bad. I worked but from home and was in and out of bed . Probably the best case scenario .

Day 4 - 5 : I was still night sweating but not as much , I was tired and couldn’t get my mood up but ironically at times , I would get a jolt of energy . At this point the sensitivity wore off but I was still so cold.  It was the weekend so I was able to lay low. What was unexpected was how your libido comes back ten fold . It’s also a curse though because you can’t last more than a minutes lol at least this was the hand I was given  this week, no pun intended.

Day 6 - 11 :  no sweating but very cold at work , I also was battling  fatigue and the  mental struggle was real. Nothing physical though it’s just a mental jump. 

Day 11 to present : it seems like the same story of ups and downs. Energy is hard to come by , even with energy drinks . There are times when you feel normal but most you are in a fog . It’s harder to get most task done, you have to dig deep for the motivation. I have noticed I’m a bit more in pain and sore from the gym or generally life injuries then I was . 

So this is where I am . To preface , my work load does not lend itself to down days, I manage people and their problems , I have a lot to get done , always . To top it off, I started a graduate program five days from stopping and I train a martial art.

Is it possible that the Kratom suppressed the effects of my antidepressant the whole time, making it impossible for me to notice any effects of the antidepressant? Today, regarding my depression, I felt better than any day I‘ve been on Kratom for the last half year.

What are your thoughts about this? Any similar experiences? Any scientifical/pharmacological facts, that Kratom suppresses the effects of the antidepressant, or at least hinders noticing it?

I never really ever measured it out (which is kind of stupid) I just know about the ""right"" amount and dump it in my mouth, followed by a whole bottle of water. Years ago, I was heavily addicted to heroin, percs, oxys, vics, subs, all that bullshit. So I am definitely no stranger to WD symptoms and went through absolute hell in the past getting off all that stuff. Quit doing subs/heroin CT one time (had to because connect got locked up) and that was without question, one of the worst and toughest periods of my life up to now. Couldn't sleep right for almost 2 months, sweats, fatigue, moody, and all the rest we all know and love.

Well about 2 years ago, my wife's brother was visiting home (he is in the air force) and he had some of this stuff. White vein and red vein KRATOM. I had heard of it, but never gave it a second thought or knew anything about it. Well, turns out I like it (a bit too much, apparently) and have been using it daily since. I work a very physical, stressful, and completely draining job, so the urge/need to keep doing it is extremely high. I have to be up at about 2 AM every day (sometimes earlier) and drive a fully loaded 35 foot truck around town all day, sometimes for up to 12 hours a day, delivering massive amounts of produce to various restaurants, schools, and other venues all over the city. Needless to say, given the job details and the convenience of being able to stop and buy some whenever I feel the need, it is very hard to quit doing it. But I simply must. It is time. I am so tired of being a slave to it, and having literally every thought/action revolve around it somehow. 

Like I said, I am no stranger to WD symptoms, but am simply dreading it with every fiber of my being. But at the same time, I am so tired of needing it, and feeling like a piece of shit, too, for even needing it and being in this boat. Any help with tapering/supplement suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I plan on starting this in the next couple days, as soon as I form a game plan and get the right stuff on deck to help combat WD.

I got on it to get off a severe opiate addiction, and it worked great for that. Unfortunately I ended up just replacing addictions, as happens all too often with this stuff. 

I currently take between 20 and 30 GPD depending on the circumstances of the day, and definitely experience withdrawal when I don't have it.

All that said, I am going on a week long trip in about 12 days. I'm not worried about legality where I'm at but the trip will involve many miles of intense hiking with my girlfriend who is currently traveling.

I really don't want to be shoveling that much powder down my throat, and really don't want to be hiking 20 miles a day in the middle of withdrawals. My current thinking is to suffer a bit now and drastically reduce my current doses so I can then just dose 5 g twice a day on the trip and then quit more consistently when I come back. The other option is to CT today and ride it out til I leave and hope for the best 12 days from now.

The problem with both these options is that I work long hours at a very physical job and I don't know if I'll survive withdrawals at work.

Knowing that Kratom made me lose my love for music (also being musician/drummer) makes me want to quit even more!

Anyways, my question stems from a comment I got in another thread. A gentleman said that I should just quit ct now because everything will be worse as the amounts get smaller. Stating less is more with kratom.
I'm not sure I believe this 100% but the fact that my body didn't realize we went from 80 to 17gpd makes me believe it a little.

But if you want to be successful then you need to know what to expect. Which is lots of pain.

I work construction and I'm active, on my feet, and have to be energetic and productive all day, everyday. There were times that I was praying for a swift and merciful death. Then I would relapse. But if I can do it while having to perform like that on a daily basis then you can too.

It is my hope that this thread will help others as I have greatly benefited from the experience shared by those who have gone before me here. It is also my desire that this thread will engage me with others to give me some accountability to achieve what this thread is all about.

I think it good to start this post with sharing a bit about how I found myself in this place.... Nearly one year ago, I stopped into a gas station to grab a pack of caffeine capsules as I was rushing off to a long day at a continuing education course. The clerk commented that I should give consideration to taking “Kratom” in lieu of the caffeine as he said it would give me better energy. I declined his offer and moved forward with my original purchase. I didnt really know what Kratom was at the time although I had heard it was helpful to some in getting off of opiates. I myself, have a history of addiction, but had been clean for 3 years. 

Fast forward to that evening on my way back to the hotel, I stopped back into the gas station and purchased a small bag of 20 capsules. I’m not sure why I did this other than I was curious and I have always looked for ways to improve my performance/productivity. 

I took 6 capsules that evening and sat in my hotel room answering emails and finishing up a few reports. I remember feeling more interested in my work, but nothing over the top euphoric or stimulating. A couple hours later, I went out for dinner and returned to my room. 

The next morning, I took a few more capsules and went to the course. I didn’t really notice much of an effect so I took a couple more mid morning, and then a few more shortly after lunch. By the end of the day I felt very “spacey” and was having a bit of a hard time concluding some of my thoughts while on the phone with a friend. So with that, I lost interest in the Kratom and it’s inconsistency in giving me the desired effect.

Fast forward a few months, I found myself having a bit of a slow morning energy wise at the office and so I went down to the local gas station in my hometown and again bought a small bag of capsules. I recollect thinking to myself, “give it another shot.... why not?”. I don’t vividly recall my experience then, but suffice it to say it was a positive one. So was the experience the next morning, and the next one, and the next one, and even the one after that. 

Long story short I had a 3 month run before I kicked it and went CT. I’ve never had RLS in my entire life. It freaked me out a bit and so I started researching what was going on with my body. I may have found this forum around that time, maybe not, but I did begin to research and learn a bit more about the dangers of kratom (e.g., addiction, withdrawals, etc).

After 3 weeks of being off of the stuff, I found myself once again having a bit of a down day energy wise at work so back off to the races I was for a mother 3 month stretch. At the end of this “quit”, I did not have quite the severe RLS and insomnia although I did feel a bit lethargic for about a week. Nothing terrible though. 

Same thing happened again about 3 weeks into that quit and I was back at it for another 3 maybe 4 month run.

In February of this year, I got really fed up with the need to have something daily to be productive and energetic. Plus the realization that I had been taking this stuff for a year really smacked me in the face. Moreover, and the most important reason of all is that I had lied to my wife about no longer taking the stuff. 

My wife and I are both in recovery and have several years of sobriety. One of the foundational things in our marriage is this very fact. I had shared with her about the Kratom issues and assured her I would not continue to use the stuff. However, I have repeatedly found myself not being able to maintain that commitment. 

Full of motivation to quit, my wife and I went to a cabin in the mountains and I CT quit, but for this time only about 10days. The withdrawals were horrendous. I had such depression and anxiety that it was almost unbearable. Based upon my experience, trying to quit CT in a cabin in the middle of the woods with no cell phone, internet, cable, etc. can really beat one down. I was so miserable and lethargic the next week that I felt like I was not going to make it. After 10 days I broke down and bought another bag saying to myself “I will deal with this later” but I can’t hold down my job like this. 

So this brings me here today. Later is Now. 

For the past 2 weeks I’ve been tapering down (somewhat fast but I want to be done) from about 30-25g/day of caps down to 3g with no withdrawals other than lethargy. Which has been relatively manageable in comparison to my last CT experience. I slipped up on Saturday taking about 7g and today about 10g. I felt so upset with myself after each time and really didn’t even get the effect I was wanting. To be honest, today I got a bit nauseated. I think the real positive of this experience is that it makes me want to jump off right now all the more. However, the misery of my last CT haunts me and I’m going to taper until Friday down to 2-1g then jump Saturday. Hopefully this will give me 2 full days for any withdrawal symptoms I might have. 

Anyways, that’s my basic rundown. I will keep a daily log on the daily check in when I jump Saturday. I appreciate any advice you may have for me.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9968844056129456}"

Well, I’m still here and today makes 2 weeks that I’ve made it without Kratom! Wow, it’s an incredible feeling to be free. Priceless, even. Money can’t buy that. The first 1-6 days were pretty rough but I managed to get through, I kept telling myself to just hang tight and suck it up, what’s 1-6 days out of an entire lifetime?! It’s literally a tiny blip in time. It doesn’t feel like it when you are going through it, but now looking back, this 2 weeks has seriously flown by.
It feels like just yesterday I decided to make the jump. I know I’ve still got a LONG, long way to go, but this is a milestone I am celebrating. I have defied all odds in my own mind telling me I wouldn’t make it, that I couldn’t even go 24 hours without Kratom, that I was a junkie and would be tied to the ball and chain for the rest of my life. I am here and living proof, after over a decade of opiates, and kratom, that you CAN do it. It is 100% mental. Mind over matter. You will get through it, just like I did. All of my symptoms are gone, besides just 2. I’ll start with the cons of being off Kratom and then end you guys with the bittersweet PROS. :)

Cons so far being off kratom :

1. Diarrhea mildly at 2 weeks out. Would you rather be constipated BAD or have diarrhea?) 

2. Still having headaches. Started when tapering and still is here. Pops up atleast once a day, in the same spot and then disappears. ( I have been going longer and longer without the headache pain, though.)


Pros of being off kratom: First of all, there are way too many to name, and this is getting pretty long. But I’ll give you guys a few off the top of my head.


1. FREEDOM - 

2. Eating whenever I want. I now eat 3 times a day, breakfast, lunch, and dinner. You know, like a normal person?? 

3.  Constipation= GONE.

4.  Music is incredible. I can feel it in my soul now.

5. Emotions are back. I’m not a zombie anymore. I can feel. 

6. Libido slowly coming back 

7.  No more dirty green stains and powder in my teeth, clothes, all over the counter tops ect.

8. Neuropathy seems to have vanished. 

9.  Anxiety is LESS, than when I was ON freaking kratom! 

10. OCD and intrusive thoughts, = GONE.

11.  My skin looks healthy again. I look 10 years younger. 

12. I can feel good being around my family again, I cherish every single moment and second. I am present. I’m not thinking of sneaking away to dose. Being on kratom was like the movie click, it completely fast forwarded my life. I never got those moments back. Everyone around me is only getting older, including me. You are too. We all are. Time keeps ticking away. I’ve got to discover myself and who I am all over again, but this time with 20/20 vision. I love seeing clear.

Many more positives, but that’s all I have time for now. The other side of freedom is priceless. You guys can do it, I’m cheering for you! 🦋",39,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.7835497856140137}"

I originally started taking kratom to get off alcohol  which worked, but in the process I became addicted to kratom. Its hard because even today I'm able to go to work, go to the gym, and get my school work done all while taking kratom all day, so it feels like no reason to stop. I don't feel like my body is deteriorating from Kratom but I know that I'm addicted to it there is no second guessing it.  In the back of my mind I think about taking kratom all day and I spend hundreds of dollars on it enough. I know that I 100% want to be off of it but I need help finding out how to get off of it.

 When coming off alcohol cold turkey I had a seizure so I'm scared to do that with kratom. I know it can be dangerous but I feel like if I try to taper off I'm just going to want more and more when I take it in increments. If anyone has any input on if I should stop cold turkey or taper off please let me know. I'm tired of kratom controlling my life I think about it every second. At this point I barely feel the effects anymore, I most just take it because my mind if screaming at me all day telling me I need more.

I got involved with this community and received help, didn't work.

Finally I took time off and got help from friends of mine who are doctors. They are medically removing me from my 80gpd addiction. (I've been sober off alcohol  for 3.5 years)

Today is day 3, I'm sick. It sucks. It sucks so much. I've been very against taking suboxone (and we can talk about that if you would like!) So I'm on a 3 day tramadol bridge. I quit kratom 3 days ago and will be completely off opioids tomorrow. Despite my name and my degree it was very hard to get help without going on suboxone which was very discouraging.

Anyway, I know many of you have followed my journey and I wan to say that I'm OK and I love all of the support. I need help because i know tomorrow will be a black day. It will be my first day without the Tramadol bridge. So please let me know what you did on your first day completely off of opioids. So I can follow this formula.

When i got home from the secluded work camp i was in i bought a case of beer to numb the pain and all it did was trigger my RLS which i found odd because when i drank in the past i would forget to dose and not even notice the WD's start to kick in. Being my dumb drunk self, i dosed like an idiot and it felt incredible (of course). When i woke up in the morning, i flushed it all. Flushing that last bit kind of made me panic for a second but i did it. Funny thing is, after that little dose, my rls seemed to improve so damn much. Haven't had any bad nights in the last 7 days.

Here I am 6 months later on day three of going cold turkey, and My experience seems to be a little different. My habit was averaging around 50grams per day, Sometimes less. About 6 months

Long story short I really really need help because I don't know how much longer I can keep doing this to myself. Kratom began as something that made me feel comfortable in my own skin and made me feel more creative/likeable etc.. It has turned into the only way for me to look at my life with optimism and excitement and I know that it is all just a kratom delusion anyways.

At my peak of use I has just moved to Hawaii with my girlfirend (now-ex) right after she had been sexually assaulted on a roadtrip with me to visit my hometown. At the time I was so excited to begin a new and healthy chapter. I did not know what I was getting myself into in terms of dealing with isolation on the island and being so far away from any support network other than my partner. I eventually had to move back to the mainland because I was struggling brutally with alcoholism and kratom and depression; at the time I just told myself I just needed to sort some things out then would come back to be with my partner whom I loved/might still love more than anyone I have ever had in my life. Long story short I left her there alone and went on to be a broken hearted & addicted shell of the person I had known myself to be.

A few months ago I was given another opportunity to move back to stay with a friend. I felt like in the time since I first left I had made a lot of progress in my life in terms of the things that I have experienced and learned; and its not that this isn't true but I was still so heavily entranced in my own addictions. To speed up the story I basically came out there with hopes that I could just pick up where I left off with my ex and thrown to my knees when she ghosted me for weeks and then told me that she was seeing someone else (shoulda seen that coming). Shortly after that I chose to come back to the mainland again and slip even deeper into all of this Kratom/Alcohol/Cocaine BS that I know all too well by now.

I am currently 25 (about to turn 26 in the month) and when I first left Hawaii was two or so years ago. In that time I have watched myself self-destruct and reconstruct innumerable times and feel like I am losing my ability to cope with my life and the endless feelings of emptiness and pain that refuse to leave me alone. 

I have quit Kratom before on multiple occasions with success but always find my way back to it when I am at my weakest. Part of me thinks that it is almost futile to quit sometimes because I have felt this emptiness ever since I can remember. I just want to be okay. I want to be able to love people again and to be loved. I want my family and friends to see the best version of me without me hiding behind my addiction and shame. Most of all I just want myself back. Life is too beautiful to sit around waiting for things to sort themselves out. I literally just want to weep right now but I cant because I am at work and my job literally revolves around catering to other peoples mental health issues.

Mixed in with the anxiety and shitty sleep I've experienced as a result of WD's I've chalked it up to some kind of derealization effect. While I don't think that's an incorrect diagnosis I've also realized something else. Quitting Kratom is a bit like moving somewhere new, where suddenly you're hit with all this new stimuli that you've never taken in before. For me, moving somewhere new is always a bit jarring, a bit surreal, like the saturation on life has been dialed all the way up and you're just taking in EVERYTHING while your brain is desperately trying to familiarize itself with its surroundings. 

That's what it's been like quitting Kratom, except I didn't move anywhere new. I'm in the same place as I was while I was on Kratom. Same city, same neighborhood, same apartment. However I'm living in this space in a completely different, Kratom-free frame of mind, so it's as if it's new to me all over again. Without Kratom to color things in with its false rosiness, nothing looks quite the same as it did not even a month ago and I'm starting to suspect that it may never look that way again. But that's not to say that my surroundings won't ever feel familiar again since I'm already way less anxious and dissociated than I was a week ago. I think instead that I may just settle into this new normal. Why would I expect anything different after being a daily user for over 4 years? 

I remember someone once told me in passing that if you want to kick an addiction, doing so during a transitional period in your life isn't a bad idea. This makes more sense to me now than ever before. Right now, I'd say that I'm in some kind of transition from being isolated by the pandemic to getting vaccinated and having more social freedom than I've had in the past 12ish months. That change has played probably the largest role in my decision to quit now, aside obviously from my deep loathing of Kratom and hold it has over my life. But I wonder if I moved to a new city during this quit that I wouldn't have even noticed the changes in my perception. 

Anyway, I'm curious if anyone else has experienced this sensation before? I'm still in the first 14 days since quitting, so I can't say what's permanent and what's not. I think I'm past the worst of whatever WDs I was experiencing (mostly mental stuff tbh) but my life still feels and looks different than before.

In all honesty i would like to quit cold turkey but i have to work. its been a love hate relationship. On the bright side it yelps with my anxiety and depression. On the other hand its causing me these side effects. I was wondering if tapering down was a possibility ? Best way to go about this?

i'm currently a little over 100 days sober from kratom. i went through my second detox, alone this time, last january. it happened after a destructive bender and it ended up being a very challenging yet life affirming experience.

despite that, i'm suddenly dealing with significant cravings again; my partner of 2.5 years left me, and i want something to take the pain away. our relationship failed in large part because my drug use made me callous, and getting sober (again) wasn't enough to save us. i don't blame them.

if anyone has any words of encouragement, that would be great!!

This place is this the only thing that saved me. The only thing that could help me understand that I was detoxing and going through intense withdrawal and PAWS. I want to be brief here, but I also want to mention how everything has changed since I quit. 

I quit using weed and kava, which were also big problems for me with abuse. I celebrated 5 years clean of alcohol, coke and pills. I reconnected with my family on a level I hadn't felt in almost two decades and spent 21 days staying with them. I got on meds that are actually helping me and have mostly adjusted to them. I adopted a cat which was a long time goal but something I refrained from with my instability. This has shown me a level of patience and purpose like no other. I have committed to abstaining from getting into any kind of relationship until I am 100% sure I can do so until I am consistently stable. I took on part-time virtual assistant work that has developed into something really great and has allowed me to quit the one job I was hanging onto to cover rent (that involved me still selling kratom). I go to bed at a decent time and wake up before the sun. I am eating a totally gluten free diet and trying to focus most meals on fresh plant-based items. I've done all of the cleaning and rearranging that I'd been putting off while I was chugging sludge. I'm working on losing the weight I've put on this past year but felt helpless and apathetic about before. I'm painting regularly and finally working on material for a novella. 

I really just wanted to say that I am happy and feel like myself for the first time in years. It is because of this subreddit and my quit obvs.

If you're thinking about quitting, but you're unsure. It is hard af. It is painful and it sucks. But I promise you that it is 100% worth it. And if you need help, whether medical, or mental health, or from people you love. Just be honest, bear down, and take that help. There is nothing weak about needing help. I promise.

I'm 41 years old and have been using K (off and on) for over 20 years.  I used to buy it in the early 00's from online ""legal high"" shops and was hooked.  I've suffered from PTSD, anxiety, depression, and a few other acronyms throughout my life, and K was the perfect balm to make me feel ""better"".  My current dose is roughly 2G extract, and 5G powder/day.  The last time I quit was maybe 2 years ago, but I jumped back on the wagon when I decided I needed to quit drinking.  Now that I'm sober (alcohol), and in special therapy using a psychedelic modality, I'm feeling like K is holding my progress back by tamping down some shit that I need to deal with. 

When you're finally able to understand that using K, or alcohol, or whatever you choose to dull yourself is simply a mechanism to keep trauma down - it changes how you look at using.  Frankly, I'm tired of it.  I have a few days of extract left, and then a week of powder that I'll use for a quick taper.  The last time I quit (same dose), I remember about a week of RLS and insomnia - luckily I have a Rx for anti-anxiety medication that I remember helping with the nights.  It still sucked hard though.  

In a way, reading what everyone else is going through has given me the strength to finally give the shit up.  I just wanted to say thanks for everyone posting and sharing what they're going through.  I'll keep you guys posted as I get further into the weeds.  Stay strong.",39,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9976346492767334}"

Any supplements for restless arm/leg while trying to sleep?,"So, I just got a job and experiences one night off Kratom and I'm so lucky I didn't pull my hair out because I was lucky to be paid 1am that night by check deposit the prior day. (Store for me opened at 6am) a few days ago I dosed my usual dose around 2pm, and it happened to my last dose because I figured I was getting DDP that same day and I could hit the store and restock but like I said it was a check. That night I had to go without Kratom since 2pm, until 6am and let me tell you, it was very close to being very ugly. When I say \*nonstop\* I mean my arms and legs were twitching or else I would feel this SHARP uncomfortable pain that worsened if I didn't twitch/flinch my arms/legs every 5 or so seconds. It was like a mini panic attack. I thought I'd smoke some Delta 8, basically same as Weed aka Delta 9 but legal (It's from hemp don't worry fuck spice and synthetic weed to the grave) but it didn't help at all not even in the slightest. I was just high with the same problem. Fast forward to the slowest  10 hours I've ever been through in my life and I was finally able to get to the store. Best believe I left 20 minutes early so I could get there the SECOND they open that door. (\*That statement says enough about Kratom in itself.\*)

If I can take something (Just an example) such as Magnesium. or like drinking milk/some vitamin to mitigate the restless arm/leg I can 100% push through with the help of Delta 8 as a cure for the boredom and a more relaxed state of mind.  


I can however start a taper plan because my new job is TOO much pay imo, and I find myself in a very good safe situation. I will try to taper, however if anyone knows of something I can take, I am not asking you to list illegal things I want to keep it 100% legal and ""safe"" per say, what would you do if you were in my situation? What did you do?

It sucked. But I can't believe it. I didn't have the green sludge to turn to to feel different, and I think that was a key driver.

2) Noticed I had a couple hours of mounting anxiety, the impending doom type, and luckily caught it and got myself calmed down before it turned ugly. The anxiety was cause by withdrawals, but the ability to control it was from being without Kratom. 

3) I looked at my watch today, and somehow it was so crystal clear, all the little details. The metal, the inscriptions, the movement. Small details I've been missing. It was this beautiful little moment I had to myself. 

4) Stayed up all night (insomnia) but I found an old album from 17 years ago and listened to every single song. That led to jamming out to music all night and morning, making the best of a bad situation. I never do that, and I claim to be a music lover. I got so much enjoyment out of listening to tunes.

5) wrote some music today, something I should be doing everyday but usually neglect when the sludge is present. Another positive change.

6) I had some irritability and anger flair ups in my head but I was able to observe them and calm myself down quickly and become grounded. When the sludge is in my system, I'll ruminate for hours on end and carry that negative emotion to the furthest degree. Not today.

I don't even want to try adding up all the money I've spent. I paid off a credit card a month ago with stimulus money and it's maxed out again. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

NO because it has absolutely ruined my life. My body, my skin, my finances, my mind.

Fatigue and no motivation, splitting headache. I experienced more insomnia this time around, only being able to sleep maybe 4-5 hours with RLS. I caved and bought another ounce of caps and I am going to attempt a taper. 

I am at 6 grams today, going to cut back to 4, then 3, then 2 grams for maybe 3 days, then 1 gram for a few more days, half a gram, and then jump. 

Does vitamin C help ease the WDs? I have seen several anecdotes that it does. I just got a bottle of 1000mg capsules. I also grabbed BSO as it helps potenate the dose, meaning I get a better effect on less. Hopefully BSO will help my body adjust to lower doses. 

I keep fucking up, this is a hard habit to kick and I am really feeling down on myself. But I am making progress. Slow progress, but progress.

For the most part I think I am back to normal, but I think I had forgotten what normal was, having been on Kratom for so long.  

No longer can I reach for the green sludge to sooth my emotions, to give me an energy boost, to make things feel ok for a few hours at a time.  To numb things that were too difficult to face for the time being.

Instead I am learning to live life, to learn how to manage my emotions, to work through lethargy and self motivate, to put things in place and do things that need to be done that are hard.

I've realized that this is the hard part of recovery.  In a world where everybody is looking for a magic pill we must realize that there is no magic pill.

I’ve bought it from many sources but all of them seem to lie about lab testing. I have been tapering but because the symptoms have been getting worse I think I need to just take the jump. For those of you who were taking, let’s say, 30 GPD or above for 2+ years, how bad was the withdrawal?

I was planning to taper fully but I’m not sure what else is going to happen to me so I need to get off. I’ve gone through withdrawal before when I was taking way way less and it was really fucking bad but doable. Is this going to be completely unbearable? Do I need to take supplements or something? I could probably handle the pain but I’m scared it’s going to be unbearable torture to the point where I can’t handle it. I’m probably going to see a physician but are there any supplements you took that worked well?

I’ve heard about gabapentin and other stuff but I’m unfamiliar with it. As i said I’m prepared for it to be fucking horrible, and I think I could handle it, But if it’s totally unbearable then I’m afraid I’m going to convince myself to taper instead. 

The only positive side of this is that unlike most people, I’m actually getting what could possibly be permanent damage from contaminated Kratom, so that will be enough motivation not to go back lol

I’ve looked over the community tab so I will continue reading that stuff. I would just like advice on how to handle it from someone who has quit on a very high dose specifically. 

And some advice on the best supplements and where to look. I know there are a lot of things people suggest to do but what are the “main” ones, and what is generally agreed to work the most?

I started using Kratom two years ago as a recreational substance because I enjoyed the effects of a red strain. I used to enjoy opiates, aside from heroin that shit was gross, but I stopped using them entirely when the fentanyl thing got much more prevalent. 

I quickly found that not only did I enjoy the uplifting, euphoric, and sedating effects of Kratom, but I found it to be therapeutic for an issue I had trouble addressing. 

I was dealing with chronic diarrhea for almost two years and when I quickly learned that habitual use of Kratom was practically curing this, I kept using it. To me, I felt I had found exactly what I needed. Something that both enhanced my sexual, and emotional life, but also my physical well-being. I no longer had dehydration issues from the diarrhea and I could finally spend more time outside of the bathroom. 

Well, it’s now been 2 years of use and sometimes up to 40GPD, and after successfully quitting a cannabis habit, I’ve learned that I want to treat my diarrhea or IBS (not diagnosed) by controlling my diet better, and seeking help from a nutritionist if need be, rather than using Kratom. 

Part of this is because of the cost. I live alone in a downtown studio of a big city and don’t make a lot of money so it was helpful quitting cannabis but the Kratom sort of filled the void I was filling with the weed. 

I want to live a sober life, and that means giving this stuff up even though I never really felt addicted to it (disguised by treating it like a medicine). 

My first time trying to quit was weird because I didn’t ever look into the WD effects, so I was sweating like crazy and having weird temperature all the time and didn’t know why. Then started again. 

It’s now time for me to stick through it and deal with the WD to get to a healthier stage in life.

I had several really hard things happen during the process of getting clean, which made it harder. It was a pretty dark time for me. But I've found now that I'm coming out the other end of withdrawal (I'm down to 1 gpd from over 20) that there were a few things that really helped me during the process. I want to share them in case anyone else is suffering. 

&#x200B;

1) exercise. It may be super hard to exercise when you're withdrawing, but it always made me feel better. I starting doing small workouts (10-15 minutes daily) and it helped tremendously.

2) switch up activities. I found myself spending large amounts of time in front of screens both for school and just to pass the time. I forced myself to get off the damn phone and do something else (clean up, call a friend, walk my dogs). Anything to get out of the rut of withdrawing and mentally escaping with mindless activities like browsing Reddit (sorry had to say it). 

3) Generally doing the things I don't feel like doing. Honestly, doing what felt best (taking kratom all the time) is what got me in this mess. And now that I've been pushing myself again I feel so much better.  Even though you may be suffering from kratom withdrawal, if you are neglecting other aspects of your life or self-care because your withdrawing, you're just adding to the discomfort. 

&#x200B;

I'm not trying to call anyone out. This is honestly what I wish I had heard two months ago. If you're in the throws of it, please know it will get better if you stick with it, even though it may seem hopeless.",25,"{'quarantine': 1, 'covid': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9891114830970764}"

I go for my follow-up to review the results Wednesday with the GI doc.

You don’t have to do this alone, and you shouldn’t. Of course at the end of the day, it is going to be on you to overcome the addiction, but having people you can relate to makes all the difference. Overcoming addiction is a positive thing on so many levels. It makes you a stronger person while also giving you insight and empathy that you could never have realized otherwise. 

Afaik, the general public still doesn’t really know what kratom is and certainly doesn’t understand how hard it is to quit. That can make you feel very isolated and hopeless, but if you can find people who can relate to you, it will help enormously.(i.e. this community)

About six months ago I found out about liquid kratom extract so being bored and curious, I decided to try something different. Wow! This stuff feels good! Way better than plain leaf and very similar to a moderate dose of hydrocodone.

So I continued taking these extract shots every other day or so for a while and eventually my tolerance started to rise so I began taking two of them in the mornings before work. They cost $20 per shot so this wasn't a cheap habit by any means.

This continued for a while and eventually I stopped feeling the effects of two bottles and moved on to taking three, and now four shots plus ten to fifteen grams of plain leaf here and there throughout the day.

It's costing me upwards of $100 a day. I'm gonna be out almost 30 grand by the end of this year if I keep this up. Not to mention that the withdrawals are intense! I have never experienced hell like I have while trying to wean off this stuff. I get every withdrawal symptom to the max plus more. The suffering is beyond what words can describe.

Each shot is equivalent to 14 grams of kratom plus the plain leaf so after doing the math I take the equivalent of around 70 grams of kratom per day. I've spent thousands... literally every last dime I have to support the habit. I've taken out loans. Put my bills aside. Stolen from family. Lied to my friends.

Same exact spot, like clockwork. I was going all the way back to the very first day when I woke up with this horrible sharp, splitting headache. That was right around the time I started drastically tapering and lowering my kratom doses, and it has been here ever since. Always in the same exact spot of my head too, never anywhere else. Today is day 11 completely off of it, and I am still getting these at least once or twice throughout the day and then they subside. But when it’s there, IT IS THERE!!! Sooo painful and sharp. I’m not one to ever experience headaches before this. 

Researching this led me to find online that some people, who are low on serotonin experience headaches. Someone said that once they got put on an SSRI, a bonus side effect was that their migraines magically went away. Also, the migraine prescription medication works on your serotonin apparently I read, and it gives you serotonin. (Or something along those lines) So now I’m wondering if there’s a link and if LACK of or coming off kratom somehow reduces or depletes your serotonin? Any scientists up in here?

After stressing about it for far too long, I quit kratom yesterday. This March, I was up to about 30g/day. In late March I switched from ground leaf to capsules so I could keep track, and by April 1st I capped myself off at 10g/day. Then over the course of the following three weeks I slowly tapered down to 8g, 6g, 5g, 4g, 3g, 2g... until my last day on April 21 I took 1.5g. My last dose was 0.5g about 44 hours ago. I feel a little agitated and beat, but all in all I feel pretty good. I know I'm not out of the woods yet, but if I'm about to hit 48 hours and I feel as good as I do, I know I got this. I just realized I had 1.5g of ""emergency"" capsules laying around and went for a 3 mile walk and got rid of them just now, so there's NO turning back!

I'd been using since January 2020, and this wasn't my first rodeo. While I kept it at bay using capsules for most of that year, I ramped up using ground leaf in September and just went nuts for like 6 months. It really had a negative impact on my mood and relationships.

One thing that helped a lot, I think, was diet. I quit drinking alcohol April 1st, and started intermittent fasting. I swear that eating less has made this much easier. The last time I quit, I did the same thing and it was suprisingly easy too.

Another thing that may have made this easier is taking supplements all month - Vitamin C and D, and at night I take Magnesium and ""Calm Now"".

I used the green strains primarily because the stimulant effect helped me finish two degrees and almost finish my bachelors. The physical toll has been terrible though. I would regularly not eat and drink and take kratom with OJ or lemonade to potentate the effects. This has led me to a bit of an eating disorder and messed with my brain where I was convinced I couldnt handle work and/or class without it.

2021-04-23 19:08:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/mx7h4s/first_attempt_at_tapering/,First attempt at tapering,"I started taking kratom last February. I have a history of insomnia that hasn't been easy to diagnose or treat. Plus, I deal with severe depression. Those two things come together to make me feel tired and completely devoid of motivation. Over almost 20 years, I've tried every antidepressant on the market and nothing's ever helped with the depression. Therapy helps, but feeling constantly fatigued can put me into a dangerous downward depressive cycle. 

My psychiatrist suggested Adderall because I have a history of ADHD. I tried it once in the past and I felt great in the morning but the crash was awful. It wasn't worth it to me. But, last year things got so bad I decided to give it a shot again. It gave me some energy and kept the depression at bay.

The Adderall crash in the evening was just like I'd remembered. A friend recommended CBD or kratom to help. I'd never heard of kratom and gave it a shot. When I started crashing on adderall, I'd take kratom and it smoothed it out. I felt like I found the magic combination.

I've been taking it daily since then (a little over a year). I initially got up to a pretty high dose, something like 3 tablespoons a day. However, I cut that back pretty quickly, mostly because it was so expensive. Since Janaury of this year (roughly), I've been consistently taking about a tablespoon per day in the afternoon.

I've finally found treatment for the depression and have stopped taking Adderall. I decided I didn't need the kratom anymore and started thinking about stopping it. I cut back last weekend, taking about a 1/2 tablespoon Saturday and Sunday. Monday I completely forgot to take it until the evening, so I decided to just skip it.

Holy hell, did I get smacked. I always thought there might be some WD, but I never looked into it and didn't think it'd be that big of a deal. On Tuesday, I felt like I'd been hit by a bus. I did a little research online and discovered what a mess I've gotten myself into. Tuesday I took a teaspoon just to reintroduce a little bit, to buy me some time to figure out my plan of action.

I decided I want to taper this down. I've had to do that on other meds before. When I first decided I didn't need the Adderall anymore I stopped suddenly. Two days later I was more depressed than I ever have been. So I decided to taper that down over a month and I came out fine.

Here's what I've taken since Saturday:

Saturday & Sunday: 1/2 tablespoon

Monday: Nothing

Tuesday: Teaspoon

Wednesday-Friday: 1/2 tablespoon

Tapering it won't be an issue in terms of the temptation to take more. Now that I know how dependent I am on it, I feel trapped and I just want out. Like I said, I've been here before with other meds. 

What has surprised me is the intensity of the withdrawals. I already had RLS, so that's now awful at night. I've slept 4-5 broken hours per night. The past few days I woke up and my muscles and joints hurt worse than anything I've experienced. I'm having trouble focusing. All day all I want to do is lay down.

It looks like I cut back too fast, but I feel that now that I've been through these intense withdrawals the past few days I may as well keep it steady until my body gets used to this level.

I'd consider quitting cold turkey, but these WD symptoms and mood swings are dangerous for me. I don't want to become suicidal as a result of a medication.

I guess I don't know what I'm asking. I just can't believe I got involved in taking this so blindly. I'm usually so much better at researching things I put in my body. I'm hoping that I acclimate to this dose soon, or at least get to the point where the worst of the WD subside. The body pain is the worst part for me.

Now that I've done more research on kratom, I can see why my libio disappeared, why my short-term memory is gone (especially in the evening after I take it) and even why I have a hard time urinating. I never would have imagined those things can be caused by kratom. 

That said, I know this is my fault. I'm not a victim here. It's on me for not looking into it further and I'm sure there was an element of denial to all of this.

I’m posting this because I feel getting medical and therapeutic help can be a life saver. I was only at 20gpd, but I couldn’t stop. I was cycling through depression and Kratom and my life felt out of control. I finally got myself the courage to see an addiction specialist (non-md) and a doctor that aids in opioid addiction (I’ve never had an opioid problem and this particular doctor had never treated anyone for Kratom, but he was very understanding and open-minded)

Seeing the therapist helped me talk out my issues with someone other than my wife. The doctor prescribed me some short term meds to help with withdrawals. With their help, this has been the smoothest quit ever and I’m not going back. I will continue to see the counselor every other week until I’m at 120 days and then I’ll reevaluate. I’ve taken no time off of work and been extremely productive. It’s because I got support. 

Remember, recovery and support is important. As my counselor said, if you break your arm, you go to the doctor, you don’t agonize in pain by yourself.

Especially at the part where I'm at, which is only 9 days in. But here's the thing: while the idea that life would potentially suck for 6 months initially scared me, now I look at that and think, ""how long is 6 months really?"" When I look back at where I was 6 months ago, it feels like yesterday. Yes, a lot has happened since then. Yes, it is a while ago. But it passed almost in the blink of an eye. And with each day that I stack up clean of Kratom, the forward momentum only builds. I remember feeling like 3 days off the devil dust seemed like forever. Now, suddenly, I'm at 9 days off. That's 3x as long as the period of time that once felt like forever. This has not been pleasant, but the more time I put between myself and Kratom, the more I heal and the faster it all feels like it's happening. So keep going one day at a time because the next thing you know it'll have been weeks since you quit. Then months. Then it will be so far behind you that the only thing you'll be concerned with is living rest of your amazing life. Stay quit, y'all.

The failure was primarily due to my wife being late stage in a difficult pregnancy, also having a 2.5 year old and starting a new company. I just couldn’t deal with the daily feeling of anxiety and discomfort, so I delayed. 

Honestly at this point I started being terrified of how I would ever quit. It’s not like a magical perfect time appears when you have a full family and multiple business to run (wife is an entrepreneur as well). 

This is when I decided to share with her that I had a problem and she immediately set into action to get a night nurse and find a long weekend where I could check into an hotel.

I did the first two nights there and then returned home, it was real hell and actually harder day 3-6. I slept almost not at all, aches everywhere and a feeling of real dread. Every minute dragged by and the world, my future, my family just existed in this incredibly dark place where I found it impossible to see the light. Damn this drug hits you hard. 

Good news is that day 7 I started seeing a bit clearly again - I had a 7h sleep thanks to my doctor prescribing me Clonazepam .5mg and Pramipexole .25mg. I didn’t want to take anything before day 6 as thought it better to push through the suck. I only intend to take this for a few days if even that.

Today is day 8 and I’m feeling both happy and not in agony. I’ve worked out every single day since stopping, taken countless showers and had the fortune to be able to go into the ocean which was healing as hell.

If you are in it I feel for you, it’s the worst I’ve done and I was in the military and that really sucked. But trust in this; two days ago I felt like I will never be happy again and today I’m feeling almost back to my normal happy and energetic self. You are pushing through thick fog and suddenly you will plop out the other side.

One tool that helped was I used a fasting app called zero to track my time in withdrawal, right now I’m 180h in since last dose :)

I can’t say this enough; ask for help. Talk to a loved one and try to explain what you are going through. I was dreading doing just that as she was so uncomfortable and scared herself but talking it through with her means I’m out, finally.

I've been using kratom regularly for about 2 years. At the peak of my usage I wasn't even keeping track of how much I was doing but I was downing a heaping tablespoon every 1 1/2-2 hours. I would take so much that I made myself sick. I wasn't eating because I needed the kratom to work better on my empty stomach. I felt like shit.

Once I was able to smoke weed, I was able to quit long enough to get over the restless legs and feeling like I was going to crawl out of my skin. I was attempting to combat the mental side of the withdrawal when my father passed away. It's been 5 months since he's been gone and I'm a disaster. I've stayed as high as possible since I held my father's hand while he took his last breath.

But now I know I have to pull myself out of this hole I've dug. I have two kids that need me. I have a mother and brother that need me. I rip myself apart thinking that my dad would be ashamed that I'm such a piece of shit. I have to work to get my anxiety, depression and bp under control with only medical marijuana..but I'm terrified about the struggle I have ahead due to my high use.

Still not 100% but definitely healing.,"Just thought I'd give an update. I'm on day 28 or 29 and it's been a rollercoaster up until this point. The first 2 weeks sucked I had all the wd symptoms. I was a 10 year opiate addict before I started kratom to get off them. I was only using kratom for about 4 months, maybe closer to 5. Guessing my dose was around 15 gpd. Anyway the withdrawal from kratom was worse than any opiate withdrawal I've ever experienced. Which is crazy because there's people on here that have used kratom way longer and in way higher amounts than me. I guess that goes to show how different our bodies are when it comes to healing. I'm sleeping great, PAWS don't seem to be too bad, what I'm still struggling with is digestive issues and fatigue. It seems to come in waves. I had a few days where I thought I was in the clear and then surprise, diarrhea again. My BM's are still not normal but definitely improved from what I went through that first 2 weeks. Lower back hurt like hell for about a week but is slowly getting better. Not sure if that's wd related or not. The fatigue sucks but I'm trying to power through it. Anyway I just wanted to give some inspiration to those struggling, it DOES get better, sometimes it takes a while but it does. I just keep telling myself I spent 10 yrs destroying myself with opiates, 4 mos with kratom and 5 yrs before that with alcohol so healing isn't going to come fast. I know it's gonna take some time. The best part is my mind hasn't felt this clear for as far back as I can remember. I can honestly say without a doubt I will never touch this devil plant again.

I quit cold turkey. 6 months ago I started using kratom shots and eventually leaf kratom daily for pain. starting to experience severe WD symptoms when I don't take the shit. how could kratom go for not getting me high to getting me incredibly high? I'm terrified.)

one morning in the fall of 2015 I woke up with swollen joints and massive pain. I went to my doctor and although he wasn't yet able to identify the cause he prescribed me a lot of oxycodone (180 10mg tabs per month). I rapidly began getting extremely high and extremely addicted to these pills. my pain was so intense that in order for me to feel relief I had to take high doses of the oxycodone. 

about 4 months later my doctor completely cut me off. I was terrified about getting sick so I spoke to a friend of mine who's a heroin addict. he told me to get some kratom, so I did. I'm not sure why but when I used kratom back then it did not at all get me high. if I ever tried to take a large dose to get high I got incredibly sick. so I just stuck with taking 2 tablespoons a day for the incredible back pain. it actually helped more than the oxy. 

at some point in 2016 or 2017 I just stopped taking the kratom. I experienced no withdrawal symptoms. my autoimmune disease just kind of went into remission and the lower back pain went away sometime in 2018. I didn't  take any pain killers or kratom for 3 years. 

I moved down south last October (2020). my friend had mentioned these kratom shots you can buy at gas stations. I decided to have one. I got very very high and I started to drink 1 or 2 once a week on Sunday and play videogames.

in December of 2020 I started to have back pain again. went to the ER, was diagnosed with degenerative disc disease and other things. so I started to use more kratom shots. 2 would do me nearly all day. then in typical addiction style my tolerance increased and so did the amounts I took. I was spending entire paychecks on the shit. then my buddy told me of a shop that sells loose leaf so I started using that.

I've been eating kratom daily since November or so of 2020. a few days ago I came home from work and decided to nap instead of dosing again. I woke up with all these strange symptoms. I had the urge/need to move my right arm and shoulder. I was incredibly anxious, yawning all of it. 

I dove too deep and now I'm physically hooked on kratom. while it still very much helps with pain I'm waking up feeling kind of rough. I'm really scared to come off the shit both because of WD symptoms and also because of my terrible pain.

So I've been using kratom for 3.5 years now. I'm was also a very heavy user. I was using about 85+gpd during the worst of it. The last year of use I started getting really nasty side effects. I was constantly fatigued, depressed, anxious. My hair was falling out, my skin was dry, my face started getting puffy. So eventually as things started getting worse and worse, I decided to quit.

During this time after quitting, I experienced the worse anxiety and depression of my life. I knew it couldn't just be kratom withdrawal, because as bad as the stories are about kratom withdrawal, I really felt what I was experiencing was on different level. I just had this terrible feeling of doom, and terror, way beyond regular anxiety that lasted weeks. My heart rate was averaging 120+bpm lying in bed. It honestly felt like a never ending panic attack. And This was also paired with the worst depression and fatigue I've experienced in my life. Like I was just lying in my bed exhausted, depressed, and pumped full of adrenaline all at the same time. It was horrible.

So thinking something more serious must have been going on I went to the doctors. And come to find out it wasn't just kratom withdrawal. Apparently I also developed hyperthyroidsm, with a crash leading to hypothyroidism. It made perfect sense. It correlated perfectly with my usage towards the end. I started dosing like crazy. I was dosing ever 4-6 house just to keep withdrawal at bay. And eventually the last dose I took, not only did it not touch the withdrawals, but It gave me a panic attack on top of it. I started getting tremors, my forehead was all clammy. And this I'm sure was the exact moment my thyroid went into overdrive, as the next few weeks I would experience that impending doom feeling, and absolutely horrendous depression.

I'm not sure exactly how the kratom messed up my thyroid. I'm thinking the kratom was suppressing it the last year of use. Hence the constant depression and fatigue. Then for whatever reason when I started dosing like crazy towards the end it put my thyroid into overdrive. That was that impending doom feeling, incredibly high heart rate, constant fight or flight mode feeling. I don't know how kratom effects the thyroid, but now I can say for sure it does. Being 43 days off I feel my thyroid is just now starting to get back to normal. It's currently still hypo, but the hair loss, energy, depression, is SLOWLY improving, so I'm assuming it will eventually go back to normal.

So yah, at the very least high doses of kratom absolutely can effect your thyroid. I'd be interested to see if anyone has had any experience with thyroid issues. Cause this has to be more of a common side effect then everyone believes. I think it might be related to the immunostimulant properties of kratom. Combine that with extremely high doses and you got a recipe for terrible side effects.",10,{'immun': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9980297684669495}"

My history is pretty long, so like the title says, if you wanna stay, buckle up. I’m definitely going to condense this story. There are a lot of personal factors that play a part that I don’t think I want to share yet.

In 2016, at the age of 22, I joined a great, bit great, my dream career. Unfortunately I was injured during that time while working. I was prescribed pain medication... apparently I have a super addictive personality or, just didn’t see a problem in my behavior from how I was raised.
Fast forward to 2018. I’m still hooked on pills, still have my dream job. Then everything went sideways. Of course when you break the law, you only need to get caught once. Well that was me December 2018. I lost everything. 

That’s when I started taking Kratom. I didn’t want to reach out to a “sub” doctor. In March of 2020 I was finally convicted, placed on probation, all that fun stuff. I continued to keep taking kratom for the withdrawals and to help me not be my own judge, jury, and executioner.
January I decided one day I want to have a baby, so I need to kick this shit. I started keeping track of how many I was taking. Before it was just two-three when I felt like it. I had run out a few times, and the withdrawals were horrid. So I tried to avoid that. January 10 I started keeping my total. I was up to 43-1gram capsules a day. I was pretty shocked honestly. No wonder I felt so bad when I went without.
Over the next few months I have kept track of my intake and every three -four days I would take one out of the equation. 
Currently I am down to six capsules a day, four if it’s a great day. Unfortunately I got a little push for my jump. I would have preferred to wait, to continue to taper. But today, I went in for a a court order UA, since I’m on probation. For the first time, they tested for kratom, which I was positive for. I was lucky that it was new, the tester didn’t know what it was, it wasn’t on their sheet so she said I passed because they are new cups.
I was granted a withheld judgment, meaning if I complete my probation with NO issues, I can have my charges expunged and no longer be a felon.
Sorry it’s kinda a jumbled bit of backstory, but! This morning at 0900, I took two capsules, before my UA. Ever since I got home I’ve been convincing myself that this is it. I need to have a clean UA next time, because I won’t be that lucky again. Soo yeah, cheers to making the jump! It’s Bee.com 12.5 hours, and honestly, I thought I’d feel a lot worse than I do.

So, after being on it for 6 months, she has no idea I relapsed. I can’t tell her because I don’t want to be kicked out and never see my son. I want to be part of my family. I love my family.

I still think it's the one biggest thing that snapped me out of some of my worst times. But there were many people saying things like ""change the things you used to do while on kratom"" and ""You have to really mean it deep down that you definitely 100% want kratom out of your life"" 

I took those with a grain of salt, because I had little hope that I was going to change my activities much without kratom. And to be truthful, I wasn't 100% sure I wanted kratom fully out of my life, one of the harder struggles as I tapered off of it. I just knew that I needed to cut back, way back. As I tapered lower and lower, I started realizing that I literally don't feel any different than I did at my best with kratom (minus the maybe 20 minute high you get from it if that for a limited time, and only if circumstances were just right), so I then decided it needed to be out of my life. Not because it was ruining my life (well financially we're all hit pretty hard by this stuff), but because my life truly isn't different without it. People talk a lot on here about how much better their life is without kratom, and that's not what I was looking for. I just wanted it to not be WORSE. 

And I am here to tell you it really isn't worse. I liked who I was before kratom, I liked who I was ON kratom, and now that I am off it completely, I realize I am the same person that I liked all along, but don't need a garbage drug to convince myself that I am that person because I took X amount of whichever strain.  But I want people on here that feel the same way to know that if you feel somewhat the same way that you're not alone

I'm still going through some PAWS I think, anxiety still every day. But as an aggregate, I am feeling quite a bit better than I was while tapering off of kratom. There's a lot of people saying ""I'm on such and such day and I feel so so much better"" Well I'm right in the middle lol. I still have awful moments, but I am getting to the point where every day now I have more fantastic moments than awful ones.

It's hard to think of it that way at my worst anxiety moments these days, but then I take a look back at how just a few months ago I was in an anxiety attack almost every second of every day, and now it's either 50% or way less, and goddamn I'll take it

I tapered from 70 gpd for 6 years over 4 months with a big drop to begin with, and every day I thought there's no way I can do months and months more of this, but I did, and you CAN too! It never feels like the right day to start, whether cold turkey-ing or tapering, but it always starts with day one.

(My experience).","I used for 2.5 years at an ounce or more per day and ended up finally quitting CT after many failed attempts. I kept going and didn’t touch it for a year and five months. Any time it would enter my head that I could use it for anxiety or something, I reminded myself of the risk and abstained. 

Last summer, I was going through a devastating breakup and happened to find some hydrocodone. It was great, so I decided to buy “just one small bag” of kratom since I got that taste again and rationalized that it would help me bear some of the anxiety in regards to the breakup.

My tolerance was still at the same level as when I quit all those months ago. But my body was not used to it. I dosed frequently and hard, causing myself to puke numerous times, which had never occurred in all my years of use before. I began getting very lazy and am often nauseous, eating very little. I’ve put very little effort into my job, despite it being a great job that I love. 

I used gabapentin and other gabaergics to get anywhere from 1-4 days off sporadically throughout the past year, but not often. I developed a gabaergic dependency in aiding my initial quit and it still persists, although it has gotten much better. 

I don’t have any apparent withdrawal symptoms at this point of about an oz or more a day for 11 months or so. But I want to nip this in the butt, so I just got prescribed naltrexone, which I plan to take this weekend. Hopefully I won’t get any crazy precipitated withdrawals and it will just help me abstain. 

All of this to say, there are very very few people who can quit and then return to occasional use. I told myself “just one bag” and it has turned into a year-long stint. I hope anyone reading this takes the gravity of my story into consideration if you are contemplating whether you can return again. 

If you have any input on what I can expect from naltrexone after 10-11 months of ~30gpd when I don’t currently exhibit physical withdrawals, I’d love to hear it. Best of luck to all of you who are still trying to quit and congrats to those who have managed to break free. Much love!

That would be great but I don't see how it could work. I mean, these must have the same alkaloids as the powder leaf, right? But it's a smaller amount? Is that like harm reduction - replacing a strong problem with a smaller problem? Has anyone used it successfully? I can imagine a cross taper being used maybe.

Also, another item I've considered is a crushed leaf for making tea. It isn't powder but crushed leaves meant to be soaked like tea, and I assume they would be discarded to drink the tea. While this sounds like the same alkaloids will be present, I am aware that mitragynine and 7-OH are not water soluble. They become slightly soluble in a more acid base and fully soluble in an alcohol base. 

That would mean the main alkaloids would be the same with the exception of those important ones: most likely will be present in super low quantities. I have done something similar once to help wean me off and that was using the powder tea to make tea with the powder strained out. When I stopped the strained tea I didn't have any withdrawal. That was over 8 months ago.

I am tapering the powder down now at a rate of -1 gpd. I would like to speed it up without much problem. Please don't judge - I just would like some feedback and personal experiences if possible so I can decide if I should give one a go or just stick to what I am doing.

I’ve made it roughly three weeks two previous times long ago before succumbing to that damned thought of “hey, I made it 3 weeks, I got this under control again.” Nope, not even a bit haha.

For the last two years I’ve felt myself slowly being sucked into the daily void of taking the sludge up to 4-5 times a day totaling about 50-60GPD. For a very long time I used it purely recreationally and even passionately believed I was safe from addiction as I would buy, binge thru my order, and then wait a few weeks to order more. Eventually shit hit the fan personally and became a frequent occurrence in an attempt to numb my depression over my situation and to just have that option to just...feel good...whenever.. was so powerful. I was convinced I’d never be able to stop and that the rest of my life I’d just spend thinking about timing my next dose and maximizing it so I could go to work and family events without seeming too doped up. 

I thought I was hopeless, but after several weeks of IOP it slowly pushed me to that ledge I needed to reach to jump. Woke up a morning and was just, “hmm..I feel okay” (normally dose immediately when I wake up) “let’s try doing this” the fact that I unfroze was kinda astonishing. But some other things occurring and with my family being more supportive than I could be grateful for, I have people to lean on and remind me of why I’m doing this.

I’m not gonna break at 3 weeks this time nooo damn way. So sick of falling back into this shit and having it control my life...~20gpdose, I need so much to not even feel it nearly as much I used to.

I wanna express thanks to this community for allowing me to lurk and remind myself of why I follow it in the first place. This sub is full of warriors man i tell you. I feel blessed, while also shitty lol, that I’ve given myself this opportunity and the fact that the WD’s haven’t been as bad as I expected. I have had the rock bottom energy levels and lack of desire to get out of bed just rolling in my own misery, I’ve had the depression, graciously not too much increased anxiety, but I know this is just the beginning

I will not let PAWS beat me this time. I know it’s coming. Hell I already feel it slowly creeping in. Dreads of existential boredom and starting over when it comes to filling my life with good and positive things to enjoy and fill my time with. It’s really, really hard. Just trying to appreciate the warming days as spring rears it’s head and taking advantage of that. Trying to look for the positive when physically and mentally my body says I want nothing, but I just want my life back.


So thank you to everyone here for what you do for each other, I think it’s much more special than any of us even realize. Hope everyone is staying strong and with me in saying: IWNDST - I will not drink the sludge today

It’s not like quitting coffee, it’s not like quitting anything I’ve been addicted to. If you want to quit, do so sooner rather than later. The only reason not to quit is to avoid feeling like shit. There’s plenty more reasons to bite the bullet, feel gross, and to stop slamming sludge.

I felt like something was missing from my Sunday routine. And it turns out, I had forgotten about my weekly ritual here. In reality, my week was fine. I didn’t think about kratom all that much. My anxiety wasn’t a huge issue. I enjoyed doing mundane stuff I was convinced I’d never do again. It was a fine week. And it bled into this week.

I catch myself thinking about how hard the first three weeks were. About how I’d struggle hour to hour, sometimes minutes at a time. How my anxiety would crush every last fiber of my brain, doing everything in its power to fuck with me. About my endless hours of pacing, accepting the fact that kratom had killed me, and it was just a matter of time before I was dead. I constantly checked my body for signs of jaundice. I was on webmd every day, sometimes hours a day. Just looking at what was “probably” wrong with me. Every crap was playing Russian roulette. If it looked good I was gonna live another day. If it looked bad I was surely dead by daylight.

If you’re anything like I was, it does get better. At some point, your mind does calm itself. I can’t really say when, for me the worst was over by week 4. That’s when I turned to feeling “better”. Not 100%, but better. I’d be lying if I said that every day before then wasn’t a struggle in some way. But that struggle has very much been worth it. For the first time in a long time, I don’t feel obligated to feel good. I don’t feel the physical need of kratom like I used to.

I don’t know how much longer I’ll do this blog style thing. Maybe I don’t need it anymore, or as often. But I want you all to know, for the last several weeks putting this out there for you all to read and for me to come back to has been an insane help.

I was just too scared to jump with a family and a full time job. Finally at the urging of some here , I told my doctor ( was embarrassed but sucked it up), and she was understanding! Even though she was unfamiliar with Kratom, she spoke with colleagues and prescribed me a clonidine patch, and gabapentin. Plus Trazodone for sleeping. 

This has been a godsend. When I got the drugs I was tapered down to 4 gpd, and I slapped on on that Clonidine patch, popped a gabapentin and started my workday.  Zero withdrawal issues! Just a little more tired than usual at the end of the day, and sneezed a bit. No craving even! It helped that I just took a gabapentin whenever I would normally dose. I have had zero problems and zero cravings. Totally shocked at how easy this was. I have been taking Kratom for 10 years too! 

I wanted to post because this has been so easy with helper meds and I was so scared hearing about all the pain and suffering you all are going through with these CT quits. 

My advice now... tell a doc you need helper meds,with these meds you don’t have to go to rehab and you can continue your life!  I was so scared for so long and I regret not doing this sooner. Hope this helps. Good luck you all!",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9499644637107849}"

Im tired of bringing it everywhere I go, and never really feeling satisfied with what ive took. I hate explaining what it is to people, and thinking “i really need to stop eating this” every time i dose. As a matter of fact, im about to go to bed and dose as I write this. Theres no way Ill be able to go CT, because I wake up in the middle of the night withdrawing it after about 7-8 hours, but I dont know how I should taper off of it.

If this is your first time reading my posts, well this is an update, so I highly encourage you to go back and read my previous posts. However, if you don't have time. I essentially have  been trying to taper down to quit Kratom for a long time and have been unsuccessful.  So I created this alt account, (I'm a relatively high profile opioid addiction researcher to the point that you could google my name, that's why I created the atl) to gain support.  I have been living under a fake guise for so long and cannot bear to pretend to be contributing to the opioid addiction community while ingesting a plant based opioid myself. I told the community that I couldn't taper and some said cold turkey was the way they got of. I tried cold turkey and it was so unbearable that I came back and set up a taper plan.

I was going pretty well with the taper and updating the community as I went along, but I failed multiple times to taper. Given my profession, I don't have a ""boss"" perse and am lucky enough to be able to get great healthcare. So I told my employer what was going on and they set me up with a medically assisted detox this weekend. I will have my eval tomorrow from a provider and the plan is to stop with the Kratom this Friday.  

I know it will be hard.

I hope that it will be not as hard as living under the false impression that I can wring false pleasure out of the green sludge.

It has been instrumental in me conquering my Kratom addiction, realizing more about my own addictive tendencies, and helping reconfirm daily that although life without it is better, first you have to be honest with yourself, those around you (not just this subreddit (sorry not sorry))... which is a tough process and wild ride in and of itself. Ultimately.

Speaking honestly, although I dont miss the routine of taking it (>50GPD habit, \~5 years), as the days go on I do miss the ""high""... I now know it was a fake and false feeling of happiness, but when shit in my life seems totally chaotic and mundane (regularly)... It was so easy and accessible. Even now, I feel like I am in search of a ""different"", ""something"", and hoping that will subside sooner than later?! Time will tell.

If I may, and respectfully, although all of us are looking for a way to ""ease"" getting off Kratom, the need to take more things, is part of the Kratom/ addictive routine... Everyone will have their own individual journey and hurdles. But please be mindful, LESS = more better.

Please be smart, be safe, know that over time the aches and pains, insomnia will ease. Back to the basics, water and vitamins, CBD's (for me), over the counter Tylenol/Ibuprofen in moderation as needed, exercise, the outdoors, and TIME (the unknown). YOU WILL overcome.

I decided to stop cold turkey after trying to ween off my daily consumption of 3-4 16oz servings. My ex boyfriend is an addict to pretty much any substance he can get his hands on, and unfortunately I started consuming kratom with him over 2 years ago. I could never afford the habit and therefore only drank a “tea” every few days. It wasn’t until after our breakup and some very large triggers that I began consuming it daily. It started with 1, then 2, then 3, then even 4 some days over the course of the last 2 months. I work remotely and had many social connections at the local Kava Bar, so I was being productive and spending time with friends. Suddenly I was going twice a day to a place that I felt gave me a sense of community, a “safe space” if you will. Little did I know that it was a cesspool for some people who weren’t the best influences. 

I made some decent friends there- ones that I have kept and who have checked in as support during the past week. But generally, I realized it was a toxic environment and one that I needed to get away from.

I have this friend with a pretty serious anxiety disorder, on top of a lot of other issues. She was given medication to mitigate that. The intent was to use those meds to go out and do the things anxiety was keeping her from doing. Did she do that? Of course not. The anti-anxiety meds consistently got to a point where they would quit working, she would get her dose upped, rinse repeat. She is currently at the highest dose of xanax general practitioner can give you without referring you to a psychiatrist. She is also on an anti-depressant and a stabilizer for said anti-depressant. She needed therapy, not more drugs. Now you've got someone with an anxiety disorder, AND a nasty benzo addiction. 

Medication is a crutch. Sometimes you actually need crutches though, sometimes you break your leg. How stupid would it be to buy crutches for your broken leg, and then just lay in bed all day? You got them so you could be mobile, be fuckin' mobile. I tried to get this point across to my friend when she started on the meds. Oh well, you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make them drink. 

It's not a perfect comparison, but you could look at the pink cloud that way. Here I am, 6 weeks out and I feel this energy, this joy creeping in. Want to know what I did with that joy last night?

As I woke up in the morning my usual panic attack episode tried to settle in. However this time around instead of giving in and thinking that I must be terribly sick, I started doing breathing exercises and trying to consciously relax myself. The panic left fairly soon after. Orher than that, I feel much better. I'm able to sleep, my appetite is back, my muscle cramps are 80% gone. Cant believe how much difference 1 week has made in terms of how much better I feel. And the best part, I don't have any cravings or even remote desire to take kratom. Never ever again. 

I am still dealing with anxiety and panic attacks but I'm optimistic that I can eventually get rid of them also. It may take a few weeks but my goal is to feel a little better every day, not feel 100% in 1 week. I just have to remember that it took months of daily kratom abuse to get where I was, hence I cannot expect my body to fully heal in 1 week. I also try to forgive myself for abusing my body with kratom like I did. Forgive myself, make peace with the past, and head into better future. And learn on my mistakes. 

Good luck to everyone who is in that awful first week ct, hang on people, it will get better. Even if it looks hopeless, this hopelessness is temporary. You will survive and thjs experience will make you so much stronger. If you are considering quitting, please do it. It is not easy I won't lie, but is soooo well worth it in the end. Do itbfor yourself, for your family, for people who care about you. In the end, it will be worth it 10 times over.

I have to admit i spiraled and drank A LOT of alcohol over the weekend...and as fucked up as that is....i didn't dose the green sludge. That's a win for me. Alcohol hasn't been the drug i couldn't stop in the past...kratom was. You know when you first quit kratom it's almost like a drug in itself because of all the emotions you start to feel again...then something like the death of a loved one happens and the emotions i felt were so fucking intense i didn't know what to do. Addiction has absolutely decimated my family over the years. My father was one of the worst addicts i have ever met. He never got control over his addictions long enough to live a normal life...they actually ended up killing him in the end. Whats the take away? I don't want to spend my life like he did. Prioritizing addictions OVER EVERYTHING ELSE....jobs, health, kids, peace. That is no way to live life. I'm proud of each and everyone of you on here, even tho some of you might still be struggling with your addictions....at least you're making an attempt to change. I never got that from my father.

Generally 1 shot a day, but 2 was not out of the question. 21 to 42 bucks a day, can you imagine? What was I doing?

I’ve been trying to quit for forever, but on 4/2 I had ACL reconstruction surgery. That forced me to stay away from the smoke shop, couldn’t drive etc. the twist is that I was prescribed moderate pain pills. Rhymes with “boxy bodone” - 5 mg. I’m just going to say... the k shots are stronger. It’s wild. I wouldn’t even feel 2 or 3 of the meds. Barley felt 4. Try 5+. I’m saying.. the k shots are stronger than moderate prescription opioid medication. Holy moly. 

Now back to my quit. I’ve been off the shot now for 19 days. But have been off the pain meds for far shorter. I, of course, abused them. But this whole time I’ve refrained from kratom. I feel okay. The pain meds definitely set me back a bit, but more of those are out of the question. I don’t necessarily miss kratom, but I do miss being slightly medicated. It’s the PAWS, and It’s rough. All I can think about though, is how absolutely dumb it would be to start the k shot routine again. I have to be done with it now. The magnitude of the depression I would feel after f***cking off 19 days would eat me alive.

All that being said... I feel good. No withdrawals. Life feels pretty amazing again. Just the feeling of spring, the warmth, the sun and leaves, etc.. it makes me feel cheery. On kratom, I didn’t care about any of that.

I have been taking it every other day of the week, tuesday thursday and then saturday and sunday for like a month, before that was every day with a couple weeks off thrown in there. This has been going on for 3 months since I got the script in January. Then I took it every day since my quit, and tried to take a day off of the benzo, holy shit. Someone said that benzo withdrawals are a whole different beast, and oh man do I get that now.

I can honestly say if I have one piece of advice for people tapering off kratom, stay away from benzos. I didn't listen to everyone who told me that and I wish I did. I know there are plenty of people who can handle taking a handful here and there and then none. I am not one of those people. I think I metabolize drugs like a fiend. Back in my oxi days, I would start off small for day one but my tolerance would build up so fast, by day 3, I was taking 7 10mg pills (the real deal pills too, no tylenol, just oxy) in like 8 hours. So a lot of resources say it can take as little as 2 weeks to develop a physical dependency on benzos, I think for my case it's probably closer to 2 days... :( all the more reason for me to have stayed away from them completely

But honestly I am kind of relieved. The most I have taken is 1.25 pills of a .5 gram xanax in a day, so this should be easy to taper off of. The taper schedule I have found, which is the same as what my addiction councelor told me, is very time consuming, but hey I just tapered off of kratom with misery for 4 months, I got this!

I""m relieved because I am getting to the point where I am realizing that my body is just telling me it wants more xanax, NOT kratom. I finally feel free of kratom, like 100% not going back, it feels so great not to be weighted down by the unknown of whether or not I am going to be strong enough to not take kratom, and honestly I haven't even thought of kratom hardly at all since I quit. 

My disorientation and detachment from reality is mostly gone. My panic attacks only pop up when it's been like 20 hours since my last xanax dose, I am really happy to say that I think I finally beat kratom! I'm still miserable, don't get me wrong, xanax brings it's own world of problems.

I ended up using around 15 grams a day  the last couple of years. I started to get physically/mentally addicted and knew it but didnt care too much at first.

Then the pandemic hit and i totally gave myself the OK to keep using because it helped me isolate and not go out and get COVID from hanging with friends.

When i would go home to my parents in the past year my mom would take a BP reading on me (she has high BP so had a reader at home).  My readings were very bad and it seemed like i had hypertension.  This explains why i always felt on edge and couldnt fully relax n center myself.

Also would you recommend to quit coffee to to try to reset my energy levels for good?

My kratom habit looks a lot different than most on here, much lighter. At the peak of my use I was dosing “only” 12g, once per day. Because I don’t use throughout the day or compulsively redose, I didn’t think of it as a problem. I’ve also been a user for a relatively short time, just over a year. I don’t believe I’ve ever taken enough of this substance to experience acute withdrawals, but I’ve still had a hell of a time quitting.

I should mention that I’m also very sensitive to kratom. When my tolerance is low, 6g and a little weed will have me slipping in and out of consciousness for a few hours. I think this is one of the main reasons it’s been so psychologically difficult for me to quit. It’s hard living with the knowledge that at any time I could go buy a bag, and not care about a thing for the rest of the night. On days when my depression and anxiety are at their worst, it’s almost impossible to resist the urge to make it all go away. 

The only thing that keeps me from using is honesty. Being honest with myself, being honest with my friends, and now being honest on here. Every relapse starts with me lying to myself. “I can do some tonight, then leave it alone for a week”, no I can’t. “I can use in smaller amounts to avoid the side effects”, no, I can’t. “It’ll be okay this once”, no it fucking won’t. It’s so important for me to remember what kratom really does to me. A month or so into using I’ll stop waking up to my alarm. This caused me to show up an hour late for work several times. It absolutely wrecks my gut, leaving me puking at least 3 times a week, even up to 7days after my last use. I’ve been trying to quit since October, but I haven’t been able to make it more than a couple weeks at a time. I hope this community can be the final piece of the puzzle for me to actually quit for good. Thank you all for being here, much love.

Edit: another thing I want to add, for posterity. When I’m using kratom every night all my wants (except that bitter green powder) fade away. I stop caring if I’m happy or sad, if I eat, if I drink, if I ever leave my house, and at a certain point I’m ambivalent about living or dying. I hope recording this here helps me to remember why I quit.",16,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9882960915565491}"

Not able to sit still more than 2 or 3 seconds. No sleep for 3 nights but luckily last night I got a couple hours. I also thought I was going to avoid the diarrhea as there was none the first 2 days but it hit me last night when I got off work. I also got hit with some bad nausea. I have no anxiety or depression but I am lacking energy, hard to get in and out of my truck. Still have some chills and sweating every now and then but nothing too serious. I can handle these acutes pretty well, its just the ungodly rls that makes this difficult. I think running out of leaf while out here may be been a godsend as I would have caved if my stash was close.

Tried doing Cold Turkey.. couldn't do it.. tried tapering.. couldn't do it(had a seizure), I finally gave in and went to a doctor and was given a script for gabapentin and clonididne, now I will say this, for the first 2 to 3 days suffering acutes, absolute godsends. Still felt cold at times and once in a blue moon my nose would run a little but those two combined doses in a day numbed 95% of any acute withdrawal symptoms and made it not straight horrible (side note, this isn't my first physically dependent addiction in my life, and I've white knuckled withdrawals from alcohol that landed me in the hospital as well as a synthetic cannabinoid that for the first time in my life thought was going to kill me, could barely hold down water for 3 days..so... needless to say this time around I was ready for fucking easy peezy lol) here's some random observations after my first full week of being sober from the green nonsense..

1. I stopped using the helper meds after the 3rd day, they weren't needed after that. The only negative I'll say about the combination is that it will make you feel incredibly sluggish on top of the exhaustion from your body coming back to life.. just embrace it, sleep off what you can. But stop the meds asap and let your body reclaim itself (dose was one gabapentin every 12 hours, 1 clonididne a day, just 1, they're heavy.

2. My energy was the slowest thing to really return to me and I didn't wake up feeling like I had clay pumping through my veins until about day 4 or 5, since then every day has been better than the last energy wise

3. Insomnia is absolutely existent but not at the same time, it's not that I don't get tired enough to fall asleep it's just that...it feels like it takes me so so long to get that tired mentally, regardless of how I feel physically

4. Music and heartfelt moments are about to be your best friends after you've numbed all senses in your body for so long, embrace the tears, it's a beautiful thing

5. Speaking of tears..good lord, I've cried every fucking day this week...over anything! Something sad, something super happy and nice, a beautiful song..but I wouldn't trade the feeling for anything in the world right now
(Yes I'm very aware of the pink cloud)

6. That said, the moments of depression and disassociation come in waves and hit bleak but it's weird cause it's not even a high or a low..it's just, there, and I'm totally fine with that to.

7. My appetite has been odd to, which is a pretty common theme with this nonsense, it must do a serious number on the natural ecosystem of our body for our systems to be reacting this way for so long afterwards..and I don't get ""hungry"" per say, but you better believe I'm down to eat like everything once it's finally infront of me, very strange. No appetite but..I'm hungry, very odd.

8. I guess with that all I'd like to say is I wish I would have just bucked up and done this week's if not months ago and saved myself alot of headaches and money in the process but hey..I'm here now.

It's really possible guys, if you're seriously having that difficult of a time with a taper or CT..just do the meds if you can, drop the schtick, we're human and we need help at times, our pride can be our own worst enemy.

I struggle with mental health issues and kratom seemed to be a godsend? feeling anxious about going out? take kratom. Feeling down? take kratom. Need energy to work out? take kratom.

Don't get me wrong, getting off this stuff has sucked. I think of myself as a strong person, but quitting kratom brought me to my knees at times. But now that I'm nearly off it I can feel my life (and my brain) going back to normal. If you're considering quitting because you think it kratom addiction might be affecting you poorly, do it. if you're addicted your just avoiding withdrawal anyways. you'll feel way better.

I had been taking 40-50 gpd (my wife takes 1.5 - 2 gr probably 5x per day, and we were going through 8oz every 3 days or so), and I just decided enough is enough. Once I ran out of my powdered kilo, I bought capsules to track and keep myself accountable.

So far, I've gotten myself down to 3gr x 6-8 times a day. The plan is to drop .5 gr (one capsule) from each dose every 4 days. So on Wednesday this week, I'll drop to 2.5gr x 6-8 times a day, so on and so forth. 

I've been taking magnesium, prescribed Lexapro, prescribed Adderal XR, prescribed Valium (prescribed 5mg 2x a day, but I only take 5mg at night), Zinc, COQ10, and drinking an enormous amount of water. 

I'm starting back in the gym tomorrow, as I haven't lifted in 9 months, and I've dropped from 250 to 230 lbs. Been pretty depressed watching my body composition change from being a pretty big, lean guy to getting a dad bod. 

I've been taking Kratom since 2016, and I just don't want to anymore. It's a waste of money, doesn't really benefit me in any way, and I hate having a monkey on my back. Hate leaving for work and panicking while looking through my bag thinking I left my Kratom at home, etc. 

Not only that, but my daughter is almost 5, and is full of energy. I want to be able to even marginally keep up with her and kratom makes me feel tired anymore, no matter the dose - and I don't want to have to rely on Kratom to feel normal. I don't want her growing up thinking it's normal. 

Does anyone have any recommendations? Anything I can add to make it smoother, or quicker? I've read about Black Seed Oil and agmatine, but also memantine - with memantine seeming to be a great thing to add.

Acutes let up around 5 days, and I finally started sleeping full nights around day 20 with minimum cold chills and RLS. I stayed quit for 6 months, and then went rapidly back up to 50-60 GPD for another 6 months.

So, I quit AGAIN about 66-67 hours ago, and i have been doing relatively....fine this time around? I had awful RLS the first 48ish hours, and flu-like symptoms for about a day. I still have mild RLS, but controllable with hylands restful legs + magnesium. I have not really slept yet, maybe 30 minutes here and there, so my energy is pretty low. But I have been able to control my anxiety pretty well, and I went on a (very short, 2 ish mile, but steep) hike with the family today, and hung out being freezing and fishing for 2 hours. I have zero energy now, but will still make dinner in a bit. I managed to make all the meals yesterday, do dishes, laundry, and even go help my hubby at work for a bit. So mostly, I have no sleep, lingering RLS that is deff going away, very tired physically, BUT, i'm... doing ok? 

I am trying to stay positive, and think maybe my long period of  clean time contributed to a much easier withdrawal! But, I am terrified that I am going to he one of those people that goes into full blown acutes on day 4-5. But I feel really good, really positive. Idk, I feel like the worst is behind me. And it just wasn't as bad this time. 

What are your thoughts? Should I be prepared for the worst tomorrow/tuesday, or or should I thank my lucky stars, stop reading threads about it, and only check on for the Daily's unless something comes up?

Many foods I never had a problem with before, such as chocolate, sugar, dairy, and a few other things appear to cause the shortness of breath again. This appears to be tied directly to my allergy to oak too. So. Eh. Its a learning process, but I can finally breathe semi normally again. Got to keep an eye on myself though.

So I went from 50-60gpd and am now down to 22. I was already experiencing depression for the last few years. Pretty much a lifelong problem, but I suspect exacerbated by kratom. I've been trying antidepressants for the last year and nothing is really working. At this point in my taper my motivation is lower than ever. I'm so behind in my schoolwork. I don't feel like doing anything. I see a new Dr. near the end of May and I know he's certified to prescribe suboxone. I'm pretty sure that would be a bad idea, but with my long history of opioid abuse, who knows. I've been on them short-term before. Kratom kept me from thinking much about opioids for the most part for a good 7 years. I'd take the occasional whatever, but I didn't really seek it out. Now I'm looking at the dark web and seeing if anywhere still sells poppy pods... Edit: looking at rc's too. It's CRAZY. No, I haven't bought anything and I don't think I will. But it's just nuts.. i can spend hours in bed looking at this stuff on my phone, but can't get up to do my work. I'm really fucking things up.

2021-04-18 03:41:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/mt8exa/pawsacutes_variation/,PAWS/Acutes Variation?,"So I was just wondering if anyone has any incite on how the withdrawals from kratom change based off of time, frequency, and amount of use. This would include PAWS, and acutes. I'm mostly interested in PAWS though, as this seems to have the most variation, from weeks, to months, and for some almost 2 years! 

I can say I'm probably at the extreme end of kratom use. I was using so much towards the end, that I was literally in a constant state of withdrawals. No matter how big the dose I took was It wouldn't stop the depression, anxiety, cold chills/sweats, akathesia etc. Not only didn't it help, but after my dose the anxiety would intensify into a panic attack, and I would get violently shaky. That, the hairloss, and many other physical and mental problems has led me to a point where I was basically forced to quit. 

Now this brings me to where I am now. 39 days CT. And I think having abused the kratom the way I did I'm paying that price in full with PAWS. The anhedonia and depression are absolutely insane. 39 days of pretty much no enjoyment, or happiness. I still have pretty strong fatigue. I'll get cold chills with goosebumps and sweating every once in a while. Joint pain, brain fog etc. Needless to say PAWS is hitting pretty hard.

So going through this now, I'm really curious how PAWS and acutes have effected other people, based on their frequency, time, and amount used.

For me I used 3.5 years. Reaching a max of 85gpd, dosing 4-6 big doses a day. This was my tipping point to where the negatives completely overshadowed the positives. 

If everyone could post their withdrawal/PAWS experience I feel It would help alot of people going through it. I know for me the anhedonia and depression and hopelessness make staying off the hardest part. But knowing that other people are going through it as well, is probably the only reason I haven't relapsed. So I feel doing this would help a lot of people who are thinking about giving up and going back.",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9987737536430359}"

It's 3 days of not taking kratom feeling like I'm gonna die,  nothing but negative thoughts, ears ringing so loud I can't hear anything. Drooling like a faucet. Tounge hurts from clenched mouth. Dizzy and cant walk straight if I get up to use bathroom. 
depression and its severe suicidal kind of depression. 
I need help! Sorry this is long but please read. I love this group. 

So I had two long quits. First was 36 days after years of use and then relapsed and used 8 days when I felt zero positive gain from being off 36 days. It was a nightmare every day. So I was weak and gave in and it helped me feel relaxed for 6 hours per dose. What a relief it was! 

Then after 8 days of use I quit for another  35 days and same. No improvement at all. Stuck on couch. No energy. Forced exercise. Ate healthy. Broken sleep but did sleep. But felt as crappy and depressed on day 35 of my second quit as ever. Doc gave me ssri zoloft and wellbutrin and Valium too! He gives me anything I ask for. Gabapentin too. Nothing helps. Only kratom gets me normal and off the couch. I guess it hits the right brain receptors. 

I'll say that Initially kratom got me off a 10 year heavy tramadol addiction. But now kicking kratom is kicking my ass! 

I'm so embarrassed to be on a couch 24/7. Thank God for pandemic and working from home or I'd have to quit a high paying tech job. I'm abled to fake it from home for the most part but I'd never be able to be in an office. Not a chance. It's stressful as it is from home. 

Now I'm on day 3 AGAIN. I'm stuck on couch. It's a beautiful sunny day. I feel so guilty but my wife is soooo understanding and says just lay down.

So what the fuk is going on. I quit but symptoms just don't go away. I read people quit and a week or 2 they are. Ok. I push through 36 and 35 days of non stop  pain and ZERO progress. 

I'm a bit of a hypochondriac so I think maybe I'm sick or dying from cancer or maybe a tumor. I could go get tested and spend thousands on tests but that would be a waste. I know I fukd up my brain chemistry. I know. But how long before I get somewhat well. I'm doing everything I can with supplements, diet, exercise when I can.

I'm at the end of my rope here community people, sorry for my rant I'm just looking to see if this is normal. I'm just not seeing any improvement of symptoms after such long time after quiting? I'm confused. 

I have an unopened bag of red Bali in my closet. I'm tempted to use a little and maybe taper a bit but with no where to go and no one to see and a wife that understands should I just lay on couch and suffer and let time pass. 

I'm afraid if I use just a little to be able to get off couch it will set me back to day  zero again. It's a vicious cycle that's killing me. 

Any words or advice are appreciated.

Before quitting completely I tapered down to 12gpd and a majority of that was stem and vein- the first week I did a short suboxone taper (2mg3x/day for 3 days and then subtracted does daily until I reached zero). That taper ended Friday before last. Since then I took Gabapentin 3x a day for about 5-6 days. I did a quick taper off of that because I don’t want to be on it. Last dose of that was Wednesday morning. On Thursday, I was feeling OK but a bit wobbly. I took my first naltrexone on my doctors recommendation. I also drank some kava. I also got the second vaccine dose just to make this question even more confusing. About an hour after taking the naltrexone, I started having some very uncomfortable WD feelings (anxiety, shaking, yawning, cramping, diarrhea, temperature fluctuating). 
 
My questions are this:  
       Was this Gabapentin withdrawal or precipitated WD from residual K? Both maybe ?  
        In general, does Naltrexone actually speed the WD process up for us when we go into precipitated WD? I’d like to know at least that what I went through actually gained me some ground. LOL",4,{'vaccine': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9977777600288391}"

Even though I didn't sleep a wink, the fact that my legs weren't going to bad had me in a really positive mood this morning, and so far, it hasn't subsided. I am, of course, bracing for the waves of emotion over the next few days. I'm half nervous, half excited. But this time in my last BIG quit, last year (off for 6 months at that time), I was in bed with the full blown ""kratom flu"", anxiety, depression, all the good physical WD's. This time, though..I feel...ok? I don't feel great mentally, but now where near ""in the gutter"", and I don't feel great physically, but I don't LITERALLY have to crawl to the bathroom, and take a break halfway there. I don't have much energy, but just got up, made my daughter and niece their usual saturday pancake breakfast, and did the dishes. I'm laying down while I write this, because that was exhausting. But I already feel my energy coming back. Think I'll get up in 5 and make the beds. Possibly shower. 

QUESTION: Do you think it is more likely that I am just having LESS withdrawals this time, as I've only been actively using again for 6 months, even though my GPD jumped right back to 40-5o ish almost right away? Or do you think I will be having some sort of precipitated with WD's, and they'll hit hard tomorrow or the next day? I know it's impossible to say, just looking for maybe someone whose had a similar situation. My first quit, I had used for 2 years, starting at 10gpd and finally capping at 50-60 GPD. This time was 6 months. And immediately started back around 40-50 GPD and stayed there, with maybe 3 days of no use in that 6 months from quit attempts. 

But, not only did I not dose, I also don't feel the need to. Usually in the AM I am in such bad withdrawals, I dose and go back to bed for a bit while it kicks in. But I got up, took care of some business, and plan to keep on keeping on, with regular breaks to refill my strength.

So my partner, who was my rock while I went through wd, said I think you need it. And it helped. 2 days, that was it. I stopped as soon as the pain stopped. Then I got the second vaccine. I was in the small percentage of people who had moderate side effects. The pain was overwhelming and incapacitating, and again, this time for a week, I was back to it. I stopped as soon as the pain subsided and had some wd symptoms. I’m ashamed and disappointed in myself. I was so proud of my 60 days and now I’m back to 14 days.

This is a long one. It deals with Kratom and other substances. 

Today I threw away around 60grams of headshop Kratom powder. I told myself and my partner at the start of this year that I would stop, and I threw everything away. That lasted about 2 months. Before that quitting attempt I was never a daily user, but occasionally I'd have stints of using for 2 or 3 days in a row. Typically though I'd leave 1 to 3 days in between doses. Highest dose I ever got was 8ish grams in a dose, or something like that.  Most typically I'd dose 4 grams (two teaspoons), sometimes 6 grams depending. That was my schedule for 8 months or so. 

Anyways, even without having used every day or having gotten to a really high GPD like some folks have on this sub, I dealt with fucking terrible insomnia for the entire month of January. I'm not sure if it started as an acute withdrawal response and then developed into some kind of psychosomatic thing or what, but it turned into this whole month long event in which anxiety about sleep and the following workday would dominate every evening. I was only getting sleep every other day, sometimes every third day. 

Needless to say, once the insomnia went away and I had maintained abstinence for an extra month I went back to using. Mostly as a result of a PAWS type of experience - I just started dealing with terrible dysphoria and anxiety. ""A quick dose would clear that right up"", I thought. Really strange - I didn't used to feel that I ""needed"" this substance to manage my feelings. But now I do, seemingly. 

Anyway - even though I threw away all my kratom this morning, I left two teaspoons for a final dose and took it today....

I want this to be the last time. 

My current life just feels like this balancing act between various substances - A full french press of coffee every day to wake up in the morning, for starters. Then of course the nightly cannabis to go to sleep - last night it was 60mg of THC in the form of edibles \[I thought switching to an edible form with exact dosing would help me regulate my usage, but I've simply started using bigger doses\]. Then there's the two to three days a week in which I use Kratom, and on the non-Kratom days I've started drinking alcohol more consistently to fill those evenings. 

This all has to stop. I've felt the call to give up my dependencies for over 2 years now. It was on a mushroom trip that I got the message, but I have yet to be able to integrate it all this time later, despite psychedelics being a true spiritual practice and source of wisdom for me. I even drew ""the Devil"" as part of a tarot reading sometime after that trip, and I knew immediately that it was referring to my dependencies/addictions. I had never gotten that card before. Pretty heavy, right? But I've still not committed to stopping - everything's just been so hard this year. 

My sleep habits are terrible. If I use Kratom too late in the day I'm up all night. If I use Kratom two days in a row, I can't sleep on the third night even if the previous nights have also been sleepless and I've taken a large dose of cannabis. When I don't use kratom and drink instead, I wake up at 2am and anxiety makes going back to sleep really hard. Then on days when I take nothing besides the caffeine and weed, my sleep habits are so messed up from the kratom and booze schedule that I wake up multiple times throughout the night regardless. I'm getting no good sleep. 

This makes everything in my life harder. Hobbies that are extremely important and life giving for me, like Capoeira, I'm too exhausted to participate in. My relationship with my fiancé becomes strained because of my exhaustion. I don't wake up early enough to walk my puppy, or if I do, my ability to be an effective pet parent is reduced in the same way that my ability to be a good partner is. I'm exhausted at work and unable to go through my day with vitality and energy, no matter how much caffeine I use. I feel like a child rather than a man. I need to get a grip. 

I'm afraid to commit to stopping. Because I'm afraid I will fail, like every previous attempt. I'm afraid that I won't know how to be happy as a sober person, that I won't know how to be curious or engaged, how to relax and unwind, how to love myself, how to be creative. What I'm saying is my identity has been tied up with substance use, even if it's just cannabis. I've always used things as a means of self-regulation and self-medication. 

That being said, I threw away all the rest of my edibles this morning. I flushed all my Kratom powder. I told my partner I want to stop everything for real (besides maybe coffee, though I want that dependency gone too eventually), and asked if she would check in on me. I committed to getting to at least day 5. I committed to being forthright about temptations towards relapse before it occurs (rather than engaging in relapse and then keeping it secret). I'm hoping that, with my partner out of town until Sunday night, and with my not needing to be at work until Tuesday, that I can get through the worst of the insomnia before I have to manage it alongside other responsibilities. Hear is hoping. 

Please - any support, commiseration, feedback, advice, routines, supplements, practices, or whatever else, would be appreciated. I feel so alone in this pursuit. No one I talk to about it understands, or takes it seriously. I just want to grow up all ready. I can tell that I need to go through this discomfort in order to grow and to take the next step on my journey of Becoming. God help me.",12,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9990235567092896}"

I've recently started tapering, after a really stupid relapse about a month and a half ago. Before that I went cold turkey (after 30+ gpd) and hadn't had any for like 5 or 6 months. I honestly didn't have too hard of a time quitting for some reason. I guess I just got lucky.

Unfortunately this go round isn't as easy. Its the worst in the morning. I'm down to 5g when I wake up. Then I'm usually pretty good for like 6 hours. Then I start..idk, coming down? Best way I know to describe it. Heavy, sad, easily frustrated, lazy.. so then I usually do about 4g. I'm generally ok after that.. I do struggle to sleep (RLS and such) but I don't dose anymore. I may pop some melatonin or a benadryl if it's really bad. 

Anyway right now my real concern is the fact that my right eye lid has been constantly twitching for the last 4 days. Like it's pretty strong, I feel it as soon as it happens and it's annoying enough to make me have to try and stop it. Runbing my eye kinda helps but sometimes even that doesn't make it stop. It doesn't last very long maybe a minute at most. But it happens every few hours and its kinda starting to freak me out. I also have had random muscle twitches all over my body.. like sometimes its so intense my whole head jerks to the side. Usually when I'm laying in bed. This has been happening since I quit cold turkey the first time.

The difference in life from full blown kratom addiction to now is almost indescribable. Also, these are just my experiences and yours will differ. Here's my story:

My last dose of kratom was the evening of March 7th. In the weeks leading up to this, I was anticipating trying to quit but rather than tapering, I was in 'fuck it' mode and had a steadily increasing dosage up to 80+ gpd. It was pretty chaotic, and I was dosing however much I wanted 4-6 times per day. This really took a toll. For the \~1 year prior I had similarly high gpd chaotic dosing schedule that consistently increased. Before COVID, I had a rigid dosing schedule and never exceeded my daily intake. Before that, I only took it a couple mornings a week and the occasional afternoon. Even before that, I only took it for fun or to relax every now and then. Funny how things change.

For so long I was fantasizing about quitting, but I was being pulled in two directions. I felt like two people living in the same body. One wanted to dose all the time and stay high until death, and the other wanted to live a healthy, happy, and true-to-myself kind of life. I knew I had to finally quit, but I didn't know how since I had already tried a few times in the past. This time, I was fortunate that I could take one work week off, except for an online class, which I later learned having something I HAD to do was helpful. (I recommend at least having a little structure while quitting)

On Monday, March 8th, I woke up, said goodbye to my gf and dogs, and got in the car for a full day of driving across a few states. I cried on and off for the first few hours of the drive as I was forced to confront the reality of my situation. First, I was quitting a long experience with kratom where the last two years have been spent heavily addicted. Second, I was confronting a big life change where I am completely switching life paths and moving out of state. I didn't know what big life decisions were truly me and what was kratom fueled anymore.

I've quit kratom a few times before. My experiences had ranged from no withdrawal, slightly uncomfortable, to the traditional insomnia/flu like symptoms with mild PAWS (Post-acute withdrawal syndrome) after. Normally I could sleep it off and recover with time. Looking back, I usually relapsed either because I made no life alterations or I experienced some form of PAWS (before I knew what it was) and didn't know how to handle myself. However, this time was much different. With such high dosages sustained for almost a year, this was on the next level. As I arrived in my destination late that night, I felt such fucked up body temperature regulation (freezing while sweating, hot, cold, both, neither), skin crawling, mental anguish, diarrhea, and so many other random things. This made me realize just how much kratom impacts a wide array of physiological processes. The first thing I did when I arrived in my destination was to see if they had a smoke shop, even though I wished I wouldn't have, and of course they had kratom. However, I was able to stay grounded, busy, and focused enough the whole week I was there to not buy any. Even though I wanted to so many times.

Throughout the first few days I didn't sleep well, one night I got exactly a half hour of sleep and I had a meeting with my professor one on one that morning (Day 3 ct). It actually went well and even though I was actively withdrawing I was able to be more present with him than I would have been on kratom. My vacation area was mountainous and I absolutely love the mountains. I had some of the most long and intense hikes of my life in the snow-capped mountains while actively suffering from withdrawal. I was able to be introspective and really think about what I wanted from this life. These seven days were hellish and changing. I cannot fully describe or even articulate them. To be in a town where I knew no one, suffering, and working towards a goal. I used mantras, mindfulness techniques, and general mental strength to get through it along with netflix, some half ass attempts at gaming, physical activity, advil, walking, music, podcasts, and meditation.

After driving back, I was able to connect with family along the way (Day 7 ct). This was the first time in a long time I hadn't brought kratom with me (I kept my addiction secret) and it felt really good to not need to leave a conversation to dose or figure out where I'm stashing my kratom when I arrive etc. I still didn't feel great physically or mentally, but honestly, it was a really good day. 

For me, the real battle started when I got back to my apartment where my kratom use is most heavy (Day 8 ct). I had a deeply entrenched routine of heavy usage to deal with all the little bullshit things I don't like and to be as productive as possible all the time. As someone who spent a few years as a dedicated athlete at a fairly high level, it was soul-crushing to have completely given up any form of running, stretching, lifting, or any kind of exercise.  I also developed a fairly draining dependency on caffeine while I was on kratom and didn't realize how much my energy levels were tied to this. Kratom would always be my crutch for caffeine crashes. The main thing that made this the hardest battle was PAWS. For me, it was pretty bad. The anhedonia made me think I would never find joy in anything again and the depression/anxiety type emotions almost broke me (Day 8-14ct). I fell behind in school, which never happens to me, and I was really struggling. There were moments that I felt good, but this is usually what causes a relapse for me. Getting through the acutes and then seeing no end to the PAWS. 

I was completely defeated and knew after everything I had dealt with over the last two weeks, dealing with the sleeplessness, body temperature bullshit, flu like symptoms, intense experiences climbing in the mountains, realizing my life was better without it, still having craving, struggling for months to figure out how to quit, feeling like I'm wasting my life, that I wasn't able to do this alone while trying to hide my withdrawals. I broke down and told my girlfriend everything which is something I never thought I would do. Opening up about this was honestly one of the most monumental moments in my life. Not only confronting it myself but also showing someone else this side of me (I've struggled with opiates on and off since a surgery as a teenager where they were overprescribed and I got into this weird state of addiction but not quite). I cannot really overstate how hard this decision was and how difficult it was to articulate the words. There was something in my brain that didn't want to tell her because if she didn't know, and I failed at quitting, then I could always secretly go back to it. But after feeling just how bad the acutes can get at high dosages, and knowing they would be worse the next time, I simply didn't want to go through it again. 

Telling her was the most helpful things I could have done, but it didn't make everything sunshine and rainbows. On my worst days I told her ""I should've waited to quit until I moved states"" or other delirious statements. Even so, she was always there to comfort and help me. I made a stupid decision one day (Day 18 ct) to purchase some to ""show my body it wouldn't help"" where I would dose once and toss it. This was the first time she had ever seen me dose and for her to understand what I went through, see me so low, and then justify some crap to myself caused her such pain. I stood there chugging green powder while she kneeled crying on the bed, and I won't ever forget that image. This addiction causes pain to those I love. Whether it's small things like being irritable, or big things like causing anguish, I quit for myself to live a better life, but I also quit for them because they are what really matters in this life. I have never taken a dose after quitting that didn't cause a full blown relapse, but deep down I knew this was it for me. P.S. The dose didn't help the withdrawals/PAWS.

After trying everything I could think of (NAC, BSO, phenibut, energy drinks, ashwaganda, alcohol, kava, and many others) I decided to embrace the PAWS because the other substances came with their own downsides. There were a lot of shitty days. I won't go into all the details unless you are interested, but there was a lot of mental health issues throughout the next week or two. I just tried to stay present, let thoughts about dosing come and go, and focused on developing better habits. I had to relearn what my body likes (foods/water/types of tea/how much coffee/when to meditate/when to work/how to take breaks effectively) and what it didn't like (how long I can sit at the computer before I go crazy/my posture/how to sit correctly in a chair/how much coffee causes a crash/kava hangovers/alcohol hangovers/laying on the bed for hours).

I want to skip forward to today. This day. Friday, April 16th, 2020. Day 40 of this journey.

I have exercised every day this week. I have meditated every day this week. I have stuck to a new healthy diet every day this week. I threw myself into a new sport that I'm loving. Classes are hard, waking up is hard (though compared to the withdrawals every morning it's a piece of cake), I still drink a bit more coffee than I should, I had a bit too much wine one night, sometimes I feel defeated, sometimes I feel bored, sometimes I feel real joy, sometimes I feel sad, sometimes I feel just okay. This week was fucking great. This week I lived. Honestly. I had things I had to do like classes and work. Sometimes it was great and sometimes it wasn't. I did them. I did things I wanted to do like the yoga, a project, and resting. I had meals that I wanted to eat and naps that I wanted to take. I did that, and I didn't dose. I didn't use kratom. I didn't withdrawal. I didn't stress about the mail getting here. I didn't blow money. I didn't drive to the local smokeshop because I ran out and started to feel withdrawals. I didn't get irritated with my girlfriend because she wanted to talk. I didn't starve myself. I didn't avoid sex with my girlfriend. I didn't google how to potentiate kratom. I didn't stop breathing, choking on the powder while doing the toss and wash method. I didn't live some sort of double life. I didn't keep secrets. I didn't wait until she left to run to the bathroom and dose. I didn't wake up every morning in active withdrawals waiting for the morning dose to kick in to function. I didn't stash kratom in my wallet for that long drive. I didn't get green powder over my clothes and have to come up with an excuse for what it was. I didn't have to lie to my girlfriend. I didn't make her cry. I didn't have to dose to feel ok.

Damn.

I feel like me again. Kratom numbed me, but the real me was there all along. There are things I like about me and things I don't. There are things I can change and things I can't. I've been working on myself for 40 days. Progress is slow and sometimes it feels like I take a step back. For the first time in a long time, I feel good. Not the kratom dragon we were all chasing good, but the real good. The kind of good that feels good because you felt bad earlier and did something healthy to change it (e.g., run/meditate/take a break). The kind of good that you're making progress on important things. The kind of good from fucking broccoli and finishing a good workout. The kind of good from having a conversation with someone and really connecting. 

I was severely addicted to kratom. I stayed at home all the time, used whenever I wanted for any negative emotion, for any mundane task, for anything/anywhere. I was hopeless. I thought I would never be the same again and never be able to change while I lived in the same place, with the same routine, same classes, and same job, but I did and you can too. There's so much more to this life.

I want to leave one final message. Not to scare anyone, but simply to inform. If you let it, kratom will take more from you. As you increase the dosage, you make more sacrifices from your life to fuel the addiction. Every time I quit I thought, it won't get worse than this, but it always does. The physical and mental withdrawals are no joke. This last quit was bad, but I finally realized there is no limit to what kratom will take from you if you let it.",71,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9923102855682373}"

I had been sober from that and other regular rotation drugs and tianeptine for about 2 years when I fell in love with Kratom. 

I couldn't even tell you why I started. I'm at stay at home mom that started homeschooling during the pandemic. I love my husband, my dogs, my life. What the fuck, me? Why ya gotta self-sabotage like that? 

Last year around this same time, I quit and stayed quit for 4 glorious months. It was epic- it was about 2 weeks of feeling like garbage (RLS, anxiety, depression and hopelessness, lethargy, adohenia, cold sweats and fever and chills, aches...everything). Between 2 weeks and a month that all changed and I felt  wonderful. My sense of joy and urge to constantly learn and improve came back, I bonded with my family better than ever, I made wild leaps in my health and ate such a meticulously healthy diet. Then...I got stressed....and the little green monster came back around to consume me in September. It has been right back to 50 GPD daily since then. 

I NEED to be done. The lies and hiding it from my kid and husband, and spending our hard earned cash...what am I doing? All because I'm scared of going down for a few days in withdrawals again? Or because I'm scared to think about ""never having fun, always being bored and anxious"". Except when I was sober...I wasn't bored or anxious! I woke up every day rearing to take on life! I was happy and motivated and felt whole. And now I have moved right back into my den of comfort. Stopped taking IT courses, stopped working out and eating healthy, stopped finding fun in things without dosing first. 

I can't keep doing this, this has to be the last fucking time. I need to be me again. 

So, last dose was 8pm last night, it was a half dose. I usually wake up to dose in the middle of the night. I did wake up. But didn't dose and was able to go back to sleep for a few more hours. When I woke up at 6, the withdrawal had started. It is not peaking yet. But it's still pretty miserable. I'm fucking freezing, sweating, and the RLS and anxiety and depression are here. I'm sure insomnia will hit tonight, but trying to keep high Hope's. I have zero energy. But trying to periodically get up and do small tasks (ex: dishes, got dressed. Feed dogs, etc.) But, moving is getting harder! As is sitting still, love that irony. 

I'm using just a few supps- magnesium, hylands restful legs, a 5-htp. Plus vitamin c in 3000 mg doses. I'm not going to bother with other supps- I tried so many the last few quits and what worked best was just geitting my teeth, doing some Wim Hof, and trying to keep my mind and body as busy as I possible can, given the zero energy.

I'm a long time user of all drugs, and once I found Kratom it felt like a godsend. Helped me get off everything else, but quickly became a huge problem itself. My latest attempt had me tapering down from 30g/day all the way down to 2g over the course of a month. I was feeling better than I have in a long time. Then something happened in my life and it felt like things started falling apart. I was smacked in the face with a depression I haven't felt in years. A few days of crying, very dark thoughts, trying to hide the severity of my emotional state from my wife and friends (none of them are addicts, so it's hard for them to understand what I'm going through). I started feeling very alone and meaningless. I allowed myself to take a few extra grams one day. Boy was that a mistake. I spiraled quickly up to 20g, started drinking again and taking other drugs to ""even out"". 2 weeks later the depression hasn't subsided, and I mostly just feel numb and tired from all the drugs.

3 days ago I got sober from alcohol and clean from everything else and started tapering at 10gpd. I can put up with the physical symptoms, but the mental and emotional symptoms have already been crushing this time. Last night was one of the darkest I've felt, but I somehow resisted using. I'm trying to figure out healthy ways of dealing with the stress and depression. Wim Hof Breathing, NA meetings, exercise, focusing on work (still working from home). My wife has also agreed to move to a new place with a little more space and outdoor activity. The move will be stressful, but I know it's for the best.

Anyway, it's nice to be posting here again. You guys are some of the toughest motherfuckers I know, which makes me feel stronger.",11,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9959879517555237}"

I felt horrible for the next two years but told myself it wasn’t the kratom, I must just have poor health. But I’m 29, I eat right and exercise, i knew that I shouldn’t be too sick to get out of bed and play with my daughter. Recently I finally I accepted that kratom was poisoning me. Every time I took a dose I would be short of breath and it would be hard to move. I’ve always been terrified of withdrawals, I did a quick taper down to 4 GPD and then I took the leap. I have been off it for ten days and although it’s tough to go through the withdrawals.... During the day I feel better than I have in ten years.

I guess more than asking questions I was hoping for some validation from this community with some specifics.

What I am experiencing mostly is how if I take more than the dose to feel it (\~10g) it doesn't matter when I go to sleep... because as soon as I am resting my head on the pillow I start having hallucinations that will jolt me awake kind of like the sensation of falling does and your body starts to believe it and you wake up quickly to catch yourself. It feels like my brain is sending electricity through my body and it freaks me out. I also notice that my breathing slows down and I think that i'm not breathing or my heart is palpitating. Sometimes i experience this with less than 10 grams doesn't matter the dose but consistently for the past 2 months I experience this when trying to sleep. This is the worst side effect I am experiencing.

Is this relatable to you trying to quit or just long-term kratom use in general? Have any of you experienced this sort of thing in particular?

I'm an active guy 28 years old. Kratom helped me quit drinking completely. I never drink alcohol anymore, just kratom. I also use a vape and nicotine pouches and they helped me taper and now quit smoking 3 months now. Other than that I don't use anything else. I eat very healthy but once and a half per day b/c evening kratom...

I am also experiencing almost like a fungal infection throughout my body I don't really know how to describe. Acne all over my face, nose scabs, I used to have foot fungus but that actually has been gone for a while now. But I remember at some point for a month my hands would get ridiculously itchy and swell up every night but that doesn't happen anymore. 

Does kratom change your blood and is that because it effects the liver harshly?

I can already see some of those things clearing up since cutting back some but I think it's time for me to begin a deliberate tapering process. I am acutely aware that this is having an effect on my brain because I have never had sleep disturbances ever in my life before kratom, and only recently after doing kratom every day for over 3 years. 

I have not been weighing my doses, and so I will be doing that from now on. I think I am able to do max 10 grams a day and still achieve an effect, and while I'm not high dose user anymore I am still a long-term user. I want to be as easy on the withdrawals as I can and still make steady progress. 

Does making a tea out of it help with the tapering process?

Mostly want to say thanks here, to all of you sharing your experiences and knowledge that have helped me understand this powerful plant, and my body better.

Rapid Taper,"Posted last night about making progress on a strange (for me): Rapid drop from 30 grams to 10 grams and trying to find a good point from which to start a formal taper (i.e dropping something like a gram a week from a slightly uncomfortable initial dose)

In the process of posting last night I made a commitment to myself that I would make it through the day today without slipping up and that I would take off 2 grams tonight. I'm posting for myself because I kept that commitment:

While it was weird and uncomfortable and required a lot of water and coffee, I had a very productive day at work. I didn't slip up at all and I did keep that promise to myself to take 2 less grams tonight. I'm happy. I knew yesterday when I posted 10 grams was too high of a starting point from which to taper. I could feel it - it was too much. 

I am going to go through tonight and tomorrow and see how I feel. I know I can make it through the work day and at the moment I believe I will drop down to 6 grams tomorrow night. Friday is a safe night not to get an okay night of rest. If it feels right I will start a more formal, slower taper from there so that I don't go crazy from lack of sleep. If it still feels like too much I will remove another gram or two on Saturday and rinse and repeat

I can bull my way through the weirdness, fog, brain zings and light sensitivity for the work day. I think it may be because I did this once before.....so I am used to the feeling and maybe know it for what it is. I also hope that is why I feel less anxious and self-unconscious than I did the last time I got off kratom.  Don't get me wrong... I do very much get the physical sensations of anxiety from withdrawals, but so far I'm grateful that it hasn't messed with my mind too much. 

One thing frustrates me. When I get home I'm so tired that I want to sit down, rest and be gentle on myself. It is so damned hard to work the energy back up to productive after work. I'm hoping that I can use Saturday to build up some steam to get some things accomplished in the yard.

I remember two months ago having a massive panic attack at work and almost telling a customer to take me to the hospital. That super doesn't happen anymore, I have great days at work.

With that being said, I am still sleeping pretty terribly, waking up super frequently to stuff my face full of candy and heart pounding try to calm myself back to sleep. Today has been a worse day anxiety-wise by a long shot, head pounding, face feeling like it's on fire... But it's also my first day without xanax since I quit kratom, and the days without xanax when I was tapering were always hard. Mostly because I wouldn't be able to fall asleep for my nap and ended up wiped out midday without being able to sleep. That is very much the case today 

But I still got my bike ride in, did chores around the house, and have seriously had zero cravings for kratom. I think tapering in general, at least the way I did it, ensured that I got almost no good effects from kratom for the last 4 months, and I tapered down so small, my pride wouldn't let me go over my last dose amount before jumping anyways if I relapsed. So if I was to relapse, it wouldn't be more than .2 grams for a dose, what the hell is that going to do? Definitely no more than it did when I was on that amount 9 days ago. Maybe my brain subconsciously just knows it's not the answer

But I am just trucking along without kratom waiting for my brain to stop thinking about anxiety and then automatically going into it. It seems like my anxiety only really flares up when I think it's going to. That's going to take a long time to fix with me thinking about it all the time lol, but I know eventually it's going to be so many days since my last kratom dose that even my brain will get too lazy to even think about anxiety, and then I will be truly free from the evil clutch of kratom, and truly happy :)",36,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9940134882926941}"

I never thought I would reach the point where I knew I had to quit or at the very least begin lowering my doses gradually to eventually stop altogether because I thought I was taking well rounded and small doses.

I've been taking kratom for the last 10 months or so.  I started with daily doses of 2-3 grams and eventually moved up to 4 grams 2-3 times per day and only missed a few days in there where I forgot to reup in time to cover my stash.

It's weird because I know that I've been taking relatively low doses but I think it's the consistency part that really effed me.  Even lowering my doses the slightest bit or moving down to one time a day has caused me severe panic attacks that last for hours, short temper, mood swings and stomach issues.

I'm already an anxious person without kratom.  Bad social anxiety, you know the drill.  This is what drew me to Kratom to begin with but in all honesty I've never had anxiety bad enough to cause panic attacks and that's how I know this drug is really messing with me.  It's like a pendulum that swings into the good zone but swings equally and oppositely the other way into the danger zone eventually.

I wanted to share my experience here and try my hand at facing the fear and continue to gradually decrease dose and quit.  Kratom is just not good for me in the long term consistent way that I've used it.

So here's to the beginning of the end!  Wish me luck.

I think they had capsules too but it was such a surreal moment knowing I could have relief in minutes. That I could have even a maybe enjoyable work day. Something weird was happening and I had tunnel vision, and without even thinking I knew I was buying it. My brain was telling me that this is what I've been looking for, a single dose instead of a whole bag which I don't have access to anywhere else.

Something inside me clicked and I knew I had about half a second to run out of that store and I somehow switched my thoughts off and ran out of there without the kratom or the cbd. This happened less than ten minutes ago and now I'm sitting in bed shaking. Anyway, fuck kratom but just needed to rant because something about that was so surreal.

Hello Everyone! Sorry for the weird morning post, my sleep schedule has been off and I've been working late (well trying too anyway).  Ok so I screwed up.  I had to take an emergency visit to Washington DC last weekend and I forgot to bring my Kratom.  As a result I had to buy some from a local head shop. The problem was that it wasn't nearly as strong as what I'm used to and so when I followed my taper schedule it was WAY to intense, I know this because I doubled certain doses and I still was in severe withdrawal. So I just took as little as possible to keep myself from being sick (and I probably took too much) and when I got back this week I just started the taper over. The difference is that I lost a few days, so now I will need to taper at a much faster rate.  Which is.... going to make it more challenging, but it's ok becuase I work better under pressure anyway.  So I got right back to where I was and have 8 Days until the quit on 4/23/21.  Here is the data:

Ok, looks great right? Well not so fast. It seems that I can go a few days (3-4) following a taper before I forget how painful the withdrawal is and just YOLO my entire days worth of Kratom in one sitting. I did that this morning.  However, instead of going back and ""starting the taper over""  I don't have enough time to do that.  So I'm going to course correct and just not take any kratom for the rest of the day. My daily dose today was 26 grams.

The good news is that even though I already consumed it all, I spread it out enough that my peak plasma levels will still be lower than yesterday.

Tomorrow's another huge jump down in dose (because it has to be huge, I only have 8 days left!!

So what I am going to attempt to do is not take any Kratom for 24 hours.  Thats right, lets let me feel a full day without Kratom, lets remind myself of how awful I will feel if I decide to YOLO my days worth of Kratom instead of Yeeting slowly like the good doc should. (I'm having a little bit too much fun with the parlance here).

In many ways the next 24 hours will be a test trial for my quit date 4/23/21, which I picked because of work commitments and upcoming surgeries that I have to perform (and train students), but also because 4/23/21 is 3 years and 6 months without a drop of alcohol.

Normally, I've been posting and talking with you all at night, but I suspect that I will spend all day on Reddit because I'm going to need a lot of support.

These next 24 hours will probably harder than my actual quit date right? By that point I should be jumping off at single digit gram amounts.

Here's the thing though. I know I'm going to be successful at this and there are two reasons. One is that when I really really set my mind to something and I tell myself that I will make it happen no matter what, usually it happens. That hasn't been the case with Kratom, but I also  have you all coming along with me for the journey, and I'm putting my word down on ""paper""

""I will not ingest any Kratom for the next 23 hours""

My question for you all. Is how do did deal with that first day without Kratom?  This info will help me today, but also next Friday when it's the real deal.",19,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.999222993850708}"

Hey y’all,

                I posted this on the r/quittingphenibut sub but wanted to check in here to get y’alls thoughts. So I was at a head shop the other day and saw a supplement called addall rx. I used to have a huge adderall problem, so my curiousity was piqued. I asked what it was and he said “legal adderall”. I left without buying it, but temptation came over me today so I went back to the head shop. I talked to the show owner about it and he says it kept him up all day and night and the crash was bad, so red flags were going off. I took a photo of the back and looked up the ingredients. Low and behold one was phenibut, which of course id heard of through the boards and immediately new to stay the hell away. The other ingredients were octodrine and some other synthetic amphetamine. Did I dodge a bullet? Please tell me to stay the hell away from it. I’ve had problems with gabapentin, kratom, suboxone, and opiates, and I’m finally now clean of all of it. Just need a little reminding to stay away from this stuff, as that little bit of temptation is still there. Thx!",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.994841992855072}"

After many attempts to quit that lasted anywhere from 1 week to 5 months, something finally clicked inside of me and I realized enough was enough.

I was sick and tired of being sick and tired. 

I was one of those that used last years lockdowns in the early stages of the pandemic as the perfect opportunity to rid of this dirty habit. I owe a lot of my success to this sub. Finding this sub really helps to not feel alone. Hearing others stories and sharing their success gave me a continuous stream of hope, inspiration, and wisdom. We are all lucky to have a safe space full of such supportive and friendly members. 

As for life now, post kratom? It’s life! I embrace the good times and welcome the bad. Some days are great while the others aren’t so much. Being able to process all the curveballs the life has thrown me in the past year feels like a gift, and being able to process them all without a foggy head makes me feel empowered and finally in control of myself. 

To all those thinking that quitting kratom isn’t possible...take it from me. IT IS POSSIBLE! I was a slave to this plant for over 7 years. I quit CT, without a taped, at 150+gpd, and I wouldn’t be surprised if there were some days I was pushing 200gpd. It may take some trial and error, but getting clean is absolutely possible.

After a bit of back and forth to straighten it out, some condescending advice from intake about having a good support system, I said forget it. I'll do it myself! I had made a few attempts at quitting on my own, but now I have just the resentment I need to fuel my determination!

I switched from powder to pills in order to better monitor my intake. The taper down was mostly painless, - I went most days without anything, only taking a bit at night for the discomfort. But I had trouble making the jump from the last 3-4 grams was difficult. A big part of my previous attempts at quitting were thwarted at night by the intolerable restless legs and panic, so I think the psychological part was what kept me on those last 4 grams per night.

Doctor and psychiatrist referred me back and forth because nobody wanted to risk giving me narcotics to help the withdraws.

Against all logic, I browsed r/ phenibut and thought it might help me. I ended up just combining phenibut with kratom. Not much help there. The honest truth is that I was still using - just a different substance, because my addict brain is always looking for a loophole. Then I learned something that ended up helping: gabapentin.

My primary doc was willing to prescribe Gabapentin, and I quit the last dose of Kratom. I made it four days, then got restless and went straight back to the smoke shop for more kratom. But by then I knew I could do it! I was on a 1 dose per day until I finished the last bottle (cause my addict brain said ""why let this go to waste""). Finally, I waited until trash day so that I wouldn't dig it out of the trash. I threw it all away - the kratom, the phenibut that I was using to get high instead of kratom. Today is day three!

I know it's only day three but this thing had me by the balls. I wondered if I'd ever be off it. This time around, it's not the restless legs or anxiety. It's depression and absolute lack of energy. I know I can do it though.

My wife and I are trying to start a family. She was feeling unwanted for so long because of my lack of sex drive. I'm looking forward to not being completely numb anymore. Don't give up if you fall off the wagon! Sometimes quitting/tapering doesn't happen in a straight line.",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9986799359321594}"

2021-04-14 22:33:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/mr5skd/ct_update/,CT Update," So yesterday I posted about trying to quit Kratom for a second time. TL:DR - managed to inadvertently crash taper from 30 grams to 10 grams over two weeks, bounced down to 5 grams for 48ish hrs and made an attempt at going cold turkey. 

THE BAD – While I want to, I can’t go cold turkey. I don’t have the ability to take a week off of work to get through the worst of acute withdrawals. 

I can pretty easily deal with acute withdrawals during the day. Having a physically active job that keeps me moving and doing different things actually is a huge benefit to dealing with RLS while also keeping me mentally engaged so that I don’t focus on the mental aspects of withdrawals. The second time around I also have some understanding of what is happening so there is less anxiety about the unknown. The unfortunate flipside of that is that I can’t stay active 24/7 to stave off focusing on withdrawals. 

I am unable to take time off of work and I need to get some semblance of sleep to function at work and contribute at home. I have Xanax (prescribed) to help me through rough spots, but I have no desire to trade one withdrawal for another to get sleep. 

THE GOOD – I haven’t re-bounded above 10 grams and I’m struggling, in a good way, to find an appropriate baseline from which to taper. I realize that 10 grams is a significant amount of kratom to be taking on a daily basis. However, it is still a 1/3rd of what I have been taking for the last year. It is also half the amount I started tapering from the last time I quit. Even better, after going through today, I now know that 10 grams is too high of a starting point for me to taper off from. 

So tomorrow I am going drop down another 2 grams and go from there. If it feels noticeably more uncomfortable than today, I’ll start a formal tapering from there….. if not I’ll continue to drop down daily until I find a level from which would be a good point to start a weekly taper. 

I’ve done this before. I have my wife’s support and I have a good structure in my life to do this. That being said I’m purposely being positive here for myself, words of encouragement are most definitely appreciated.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9926145076751709}"

Have felt WDs in the past but not anymore even though the last 4 months have been the worst as far as repeated and frequent usage. Maybe my body is used to the WD or the fact I was able to space most days out prevented any real WDs. 

I read people’s posts on here about intense WDs and I notice people who use a lot of the plain leaf and dose daily get the worst of it. Extracts are the devil, it makes you an addict more than any other substance I can think of, even heroin. 

I know this territory to be the most difficult, the cravings are intense. You get hit with this random feeling of sadness and you don’t know how to deal with this feeling of being uncomfortable so you think about using kratom, at first you say no, but the more your mind dwells on it the closer you get to relapse. Then once your mind starts to try to justify it or make excuses to use, you’ll end up finding one and fall back down into the pit of addiction you been digging for the last how ever many years. 

I can say that this time the cravings haven’t been as bad, all the healthy eating, supps, workouts, water and grass has helped tremendously. Also counseling and this subreddit are to be celebrated as well. I still get hit with those waves of sadness, however, instead of fighting it or giving in I simply re focus on something body and mind consuming, then all the sudden after I stop thinking about using and have focused on something positive, I’m hit with a feeling of happiness. 

That sad feeling we get is normal, no workout or supplement will prevent you from facing this reality. The more you fight it the more your mind focuses on it which will lead to relapse, just don’t think about it and soon that sad feeling will go away. Get used to being uncomfortable and have a long list of activities for you to re focus on. Cheers",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.5125945210456848}"

I’ve abused Oxy since early 2016 and have been on Kratom for 2 of those years as well. Basically daily. Probably around 15 gpd. Been in denial during the time that I’ve been on Kratom that I’m an addict, but here I am, accepting it, and ready to quit. I’ve been having the seemingly common issues of muscle loss, hair loss, etc., and it’s scaring me to the point where I have to quit. Hoping to do a slow taper. I’ve withdrawn before cold turkey from the Oxy and the first week was pretty miserable. I’m hoping the Kratom withdrawal won’t be as bad as that but I have a feeling it probably will be. But I’m hoping the gradual taper helps. I’ve changed my opinion of Kratom. Used to be an advocate, but seeing the physical effects it’s having on me, as well as hearing similar stories from others, as well as the physical dependence, I’ve changed my tune. I’d like to know though if people in Thailand and other parts of Asia who have been using Kratom for hundreds of years have the same physical effects as many Westerners. If not, then there’s something in the formulation of the Kratom in the States that isn’t in the dry leaves. That could be concerning I guess. Anyway, any suggestions for the withdrawals would be helpful. I haven’t resorted to Suboxone yet. Hoping to do this without it. But I guess a question would be how long until the worst of the withdrawal effects are gone? 1 week? Keep in mind that I’ve been a daily user for 2 years and about 15 grams per day. The worst of the Oxy withdrawal was the first week. Then after that it got better but the psychological effects of not having the Oxy was difficult to work through. I was up to about 150mg of Oxy per day, and could take 7 or 8 Vicodin at once and barely be high. That’s why I thought Kratom would be a safer alternative. I don’t think it is anymore. I took it to help with the Oxy withdrawals (I’ve withdrawn several times from Oxy trying to quit for good), but just ended up getting addicted to Kratom. Anyway, the way out is through right? I know it is. Wish me luck, and any suggestions would be helpful. I’ll be starting the taper tomorrow. Will post how it’s going each day.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9973324537277222}"

I felt like I should have went back to work after week 2 so I can start rewiring my brain and get my blood pumping. 

Long story short, I experienced tremors a few times when I first started taking Kratom as well, my arms were shaky, hands, neck, legs etc and when I stretch or exert the muscle, it got even shakier. 

I actually went to the ER when I was on kratom a couple years ago because the tremors were so bad my arms were bouncing around, after a EKG They kept telling me anxiety and I said no way, I have never had anxiety in my life and I have nothing to be anxious about, they gave me an IV of anxiety meds and sure enough ALL of the shaking stopped immediately. It blew my mind how anxiety can be physical symptoms without actually feeling anxious in my head. 

 This went away for a long time,, but now that I've quit it has come back at day 40, some moments it'll be bad but not nearly as bad as when I was on Kratom.  some moments barely noticeable. The first day it happened I could feel my chest shaking from the inside, sounds wierd but it was like my body was vibrating, now its just kinda annoying, when I stretch my legs I can feel them bouncing a little bit, or sometimes I notice it when I'm holding my phone. Thinking it could possibly be anxiety related as well because today when I sat in my car, I realized I had left my phone inside the gas station and I got anxious and immediately I could feel the tremors intensify in my knees, hands, etc. Then after the mental anxiety went away once I retrieved my phone, the tremors lingered for about 30 minutes. 

Anyone else experience this? Anxiety or neurological damage, hopefully not. I know people get PAWS later on, could that be what I'm just first experiencing at day 40-45. And is it normal for it to last all day/week?

But I haven't felt shitty ALL day. I asked myself ""do you feel worse than two days ago?"" and the answer is no. It's a tiny bit of progress each day, but I'll take any progress I can get. And I can still work a full shift at work no problem, it even still seems to help. The things, especially at work, that stress me out and used to make me use kratom are getting easier to just handle without it. I mean serious stress pops up and kratom doesn't even show up in my head as a possibility much less a solution. 

In fact my biggest worry when finally quitting after such a long taper is my old dose times. For years and years I have been used to glancing at the clock to check when I am taking my next dose. I was so worried that when I finally quit I was going to struggle immensely around my dose times thinking I am missing something and need to take some drug, and honestly I don't even think about it, and haven't since day one.

Didn’t mess up my taper at all. Was SO motivated to quit. Had four days off to deal with the acutes. Everything was going well. Then I went back to work. The first day back was hard. First half of the day was okay but the second half of the day was hard. I’m a manager at a grocery store and my job is very physical. Second day back at work I just got really overwhelmed. Our district manager and director of operations was making a visit the next day and I had a huge list of shit to do and I was just sooo fatigued. It was like a switch flipped in my head. Completely convinced myself that quitting kratom wasn’t helping me at all. I wasn’t any healthier. I’d never have as much energy as I did on kratom. Perused posts on the kratom subreddit trying to convince myself that kratom wasn’t really that bad. Ended up taking about 10 grams in two doses. Which did help me get shit done at work. But even after tapering and abstaining for that long the euphoria was MILD and very short lived. It wasn’t any better than the end of my usage. When I got home from work I was just so very depressed and guilty for throwing away all that I had worked for. I was over stimulated, I couldn’t sleep. I felt like my neuropathy was acting up again. The kratom didn’t make me feel very good. I guess I just really needed a reminder. And I was totally lying to myself that that getting off kratom hadn’t made me healthier. I look better. My face looks better. I’ve lost weight. I laugh more. I’m more social. And the first two years at my job before I took kratom, I was running circles around other people.

      AP/12 - was already pretty uncomfortable as soon as i woke up. i felt fucked up. was still getting wobby eyes and overall just felt fucked up, not from kratom, but from the withdrawls lmfao is this common? then just throughout the day the symptoms gradually got a lil worse. the typical skin crawling gross body feeling, chills, fatigue, all that. 

     After waking up i knew it would be best to get active so i took a quick shower (to feel better) and hopped in traffic from 10-7 and busted out the side hustle. Helped extraordinary in reducing the severity of my symptoms. 

       Got back to my place at around 7. Showered once more and felt pretty decent for a few minutes afterwards. Once i laid down on my bed I started to feel the effects creeping up again. Had a friend pick me up to get active again. That’s when my legs started to feel a bit off. I presume it’s RLS. The best way I can describe it is, as if you’re stretching your legs out but you never let the tension loose. which is the whole point of why stretching feels good. The weird part is I never normally experience RLS with things of this nature, in the past. 

        Other than that just a slight but steady stomach pain towards the end of the night. Might’ve experienced this during the day, may have went unnoticed, who knows i don’t remember. Wasn’t able to eat anything throughout the day, forced myself to eat a small bag of trail mix. Made me kinda feel gross afterwards actually, just the thought of food is disgusting right now. 

         AP/13 - Pretty much same ordeal as the previous. Woke up early and got active. Felt the fatigue a lil stronger. Kept coming back to my place for a lil, then heading out again. Overall, didn’t move around as much as I did the previous but still enough to take my mind off the shit and be exhausted enough to sleep. 

         AP/14- Woke up early again, still haven’t found the energy to get out. Have yet to take a shower. Also shortly after waking up, I was having THE worst stomach pains. like excruciating pain, the type of pain that makes you shoot up outta your chair and clench your stomach. Don’t think it’s my stomach on second thought, it’s like the intestines right below the stomach.

       All and all not too bad though, I seem to be combatting it pretty well. Forgot to mention whenever I’m at home, I’ve been trying to pump out a few curls or jumping jacks just to stay moving. Absolutely hate hate hate just sitting down cause that’s when the worst of it seems to really sink it.

I liked the energy they gave me to get things done, on top of taking away all my aches and pains. I made several attempts to quit over the years with no success. Until I found Kratom. Had I known the hell that I was in for I never would have touched this evil plant. I CT off 15 gpd and the first week was absolute hell! Honestly worse than any opiate detox I've experienced. Not trying to scare anyone, it's not the same for everyone just being honest about my personal experience. Body aches, sneezing, runny nose, extreme fatigue, horrible RLS, WORST stomach and instestinal pains I've ever experienced in my life, yellow diarrhea for two weeks. I legit thought I was dying, that I'd done some irreversible damage to my digestive system. I ate super bland foods for two weeks, got a really good probiotic, methylated b complex, melatonin, vitamin c, and vitamin D3 supplement. Diarrhea finally stopped about day 15 or 16 but I had some weird spasms in my instestines that lasted 24 hrs and then stopped. I'm definitely feeling a lot better at 21 days but I'm nowhere near 100%. (I really envy those that bounce back so quick) I've noticed it goes back and forth. I'll have a decent day and then a bad one the next. My biggest problems are fatigue and lack of motivation. Usually about 2-3 pm I'm exhausted and just want to sleep which is frustrating because I can't do that with my busy schedule. I really have to mentally push myself to get stuff done. I also have those thoughts come in that I've done too much damage to myself to ever be able to feel normal and naturally energized again. I know this is just PAWS, I recognize these depressive thoughts and do my best to push them aside and pep talk myself. I know after so many years of using it's gonna take more than 21 days to heal and feel normal. Just curious for any long term opiate or kratom users how long before you truly felt normal and naturally good and energized? I just want that back so badly! Anyway, for anyone out there struggling just know that is does get better. It may be a slow process but every day our bodies and our minds are healing. Stick with it! It may be hard but it's SO worth it. One more thing is like to add is that it's really nice to not feel like I'm in a cloud anymore. I feel more present in the lives of those around me than I have in many years. That alone is a win for me.",8,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9988250136375427}"

Looking back, I think that was just part of the recovery process from my 10+ years of abusing alcohol. I was about 6 months in before I was introduced to kratom.

I loved it at first. Made me feel great. My anxiety and depression were completely gone. Life WAS better. I'm in year three and dislike everything at this point. I smell like kratom. I taste kratom in certain things that I used to enjoy. My skin is dry and in one particular area that used to get really dry when I was abusing alcohol, so all of this feels reminiscent of that experience...

I live my life around it. I'm always calculating when my next dose is. I can't sleep more than 4-5 hours before I have to dose again. My wife knows I take it but I still hide the fact that I take it. I simply use it to feel ""normal"" at this point. 

The reason I haven't quit earlier is because I can't handle the withdrawal symptoms. Mainly the anxiety. My anxiety is one of the sole reasons why I drank and why I started taking kratom.

I ordered some opi-c to help with the withdrawal symptoms. My plan is to use the tapering method in this subreddit and possibly buy some cbd to help with the anxiety.

I will gladly take any pointers, tips, advice, etc.

I was doing good previously and only taking Kratom a couple times a week but of course work got super busy and I got stressed so that quickly became a few times a day again. Finally talked to a med doctor and they put me on gabapentin for my anxiety (my best friend and my mom both are on it and says it really helps without being too much) so I was put on 300mg up to three times a day as needed. The day I got my script I dumped the few Kratom caps I had left and this was a couple days ago. I haven’t taken Kratom since Sunday and I feel ZERO withdrawals. My mood is stable and I am getting good sleep. Only downfall is the gaba does make me a little drowsy but I’m only taking it 2 times a day and then I’ll probably take a little less once I know I’m in the clear for Kratom withdrawal. I also take black seed oil which my doctor says it’s great and to keep taking and I think that’s helping too and why I don’t feel anything bad from stopping Kratom.

As for many of us, I've been having no benefits from kratom anymore, but it was making me sick if I took it and even more sick if I didn't. I decided to do a fast taper from about 18gpd (3.5g × 5). First, i cut out my last evening dose at 6PM, so I was at 3.5 x 4. Didn't notice any WD so after about a week I cut out another dose and cut the remaining 3 doses to 2.5g. Basically I went from 14gpd to 7gpd. That is when sh*t hit the fan. I started having terrible disabling panic attacks, my heatt is pounding so fast and hard, diarrhea every hour, muscle aches, completely blocked nose, inability to sleep. After a few days it got so bad, I freaked out my heart was failing and went to the ER (they couldn't find anything wrong of course). So I did not let that stop me and after another week cut 7gpd in half; all the crap continued as I described before. Then after a few days I just jumped... 

Today is the 3rd day with no kratom. I feel a little better but WD still sucks. Panic attacks and heart pounding are so far the worst. It comes in waves, usually I start feeling it rise after I get up at 6, then it rises and rises until reaches a peak at about noon to 1pm, and then in the afternoon goes down. In the evening I feel almost normal. I think this is because lately I consumed kratom mostly in the morning, and my body is still expecting kratom at that time. 

Overall, so far it has been exceptionally hard. But I am not going back. Im done poisoning myself. The truth is at a certain point you feel krappy if you take it and even krappier if you don't, so you cannot win unless you push through all this suffering head first. I'm just looking for some words of encouragement if you guys have any. Also, panic attacks and heart pounding are the side effects of WD, right? I've had them before every once in a while but now it seems to have gotten so bad... :(

The only things still affecting me are an upset stomach (it makes sounds I didn't even know it was capable of), no solid poops yet and sleep is slowly getting better but not what it's supposed to be. 

For people who are in a similar situation as I was, my withdrawal timeline:

* 04-04: my last dose before sleep.
* 05-04: most of the day was fine. Withdrawal started in the early evening. This started with the usual symptoms such as RLS, sweating and insomnia.
* 06-04: In full withdrawal. Pretty much the same as yesterday evening but stronger.
* 07-04: The worst day of withdrawal, got to the point where I almost gave up. 
* 08-04: This day the withdrawal became a bit less intense. still far from feeling ok but this gave some hope.
* 09-04: Yesterday I drank too much (I wanted to escape the withdrawal symptoms, this is not the way).  So this day I had withdrawal+hangover. I think without the drinking this day would have been better than the day before.
* 10-04: This day I finally felt a bit ok again. The sweats and RLS came in 'waves'. Way less intense than before.
* 11-04 - now: It seems to be getting a bit better everyday. Sleep is slowly returning (capable of sleeping 6 hours now, usually I needed 8). From this point I really felt like I was released from it.

&#x200B;

Things that helped me:

* During the first days I felt too ill to do anything. When I had more energy I noticed every time I'm staying active I feel better. Also exercise seems to be helping with the RLS at night.
* When I felt disgusted by the sweat I took a long hot shower. Doing this helped to get rid of the sweats for some time after that and it also improved my mood a lot.
* During the first days I took many vitamins/supplements. Mostly c, but also b,d,zinc and magnesium. When it was time for bed I drank some valerian root tea and took melatonin.
* Reading the posts in this place and posting was and still is helping me a lot.
* During the first days I was alone in total isolation. When I started feeling better I noticed going to friends and family made me feel much better.

Friends where taking it, describing it as some sort of tea. I loved it and it made me drop my weed habit. It didnt made me feel clouded the next day, basically no side effects, also i preffered the effect to weed. I used it only on evenings back then.

But I quickly found this subreddit and for the first year I took K very sporadically. I knew from the beginning how dangerous it was and thought I can manage it. Bought a small bag, then didnt buy for 2-3 months. When lockdown came, this changed. Working from home, I started taking small dosing in the morning. This quickly became a daily habit and I was going up to 10 GPD.

Because I was afraid of addiciton I made a rule - buy 250 gram and when it is done, do a 3 week break. This worked fine, but it also allowed me to be even less careful when I was taking - I am doing a 3 week break anyway, right? I am all good. This went on for almost a year. In the end I was on rougly 15 GDP, taking several doses a day, starting with 2g going up to 6-8g at night.

Never had any withdrawels in my 3 week breaks - it was really easy to stop. Probably because I was taking frequent breaks. But I realized that it will only get worse. I could control my self less and less when I had Kratom. Also I read this sub a lot so I absolutly knew that this is a one way street.

35 days ago I started another break, but this time with the absolute intention for it to be my last. Funnily enough, this timeI had some minor withdrawels, one night RLS and a minor cold. However this gave me extra motivation to not start again. I would say first week was a little rough. Since week 3 I do not really think about the K anymore. Of course it would be nice, but I have the mindset that I can still become a stoner, addict, etc. when I am retiring :D right now I have my family and health to care about. I have a good job, loving girlfriend and an amazing daughter. I owe it to them. Once this part of my life is over, lets see if I still want to go back.

Not only do I feel extreme shame, guilt and hypocrisy, but I am also scared to death of coming off of this stuff and I don't know what to do.","Throwaway account for obvious reasons and apologies in advance for what will be a lengthy post. I would really appreciate all of you who take the time to read this and offer any advice, comments, words of wisdom or even just criticism as I feel like part of me needs to be put in my place. 

So to start out I have the brain of a true addict and not a soul knows this except my parents and a select few of my friends. I struggled a lot with anxiety and depression while growing up as a kid and this caused me to want to become a doctor and help others going through similar stuff that I had went through mentally, so I decided to become a psychiatrist. My big stint with drug addiction began early on in high school after a psychiatrist had prescribed me Xanax every day for general anxiety disorder. I was given the extended release version for the first few years so I never got a high from it whatsoever. However, after moving away for college I had to find a new psychiatrist and he continued my Xanax script, but accidentally wrote me for the instant release ones. This was the first time I really felt a ""high"" from them and I loved it so much that of course I never told him he made a mistake and I spiraled downhill for another few years while popping these things like candy and buying an insane extra amount of them off of the street. I fully knew I had an addiction problem and thankfully as stupid as I was, I never injured others, myself or got in trouble because of my Xanax use. One random day I decided to face the fact that I was an addict and it was time to get off of benzos for good. I was extremely proud of myself as I had my doctor switch me over to Valium and I slowly and successfully tapered off myself for almost 2 years without ever letting him know I was an addict, plus not once did I ever slip up with my taper and take more than I was supposed to. After I got off of the Valium in undergrad I never touched a benzo again. 

Now enter stimulants. I absolutely *despise* them. My body can't handle them at all and even the smallest amount of caffeine makes me extremely anxious, shaky, nauseous, vomit etc.. During my first year of med school I was constantly tired all of the time due to the time commitment and I tried so hard to slowly start drinking coffee by tapering up on it very slowly, but it still did not sit well with me one bit. Being a first year med student I was still pretty naive to most of medicine and the gas station down the street from my school used to sell these powdered capsules by the front register. I was talking to the store owner one day asking what they were and he gave me the talk about how they are basically a natural ground up coffee leaf supplement that give people similar energy to regular coffee except without most of the anxiety and jitteriness. This sounded like an absolute no brainer to me and I felt like I finally found the best coffee substitute in the world that would both give me energy while simultaneously bypassing the side effects of regular caffeine. Of course stupid me didn't research them at all until I had been taking them for a couple months already, so I had absolutely no knowledge about it being an opioid while I had been taking them every day for months. 

Now I have been prescribed a very short course of opiates a couple of times in my life due to a few sports injuries, and those things got me so damn high and I could tell how addicting they could be. I made a promise to myself after my first time getting prescribed them that I would never mess with them recreationally because I knew I would 110% get addicted and they would eventually end up killing me. I was pretty surprised to first read about kratoms opiate receptor effects because they never got me high in the slightest like previous prescribed Vicodin or Percocet did. This point in my life would have been the perfect time to try and get off of kratom, but I was worried about going through opiate withdrawal during med school. So I just kept taking them for the energizing effect, fully knowing that one day I would need to get off of it, and when that time comes I knew it was probably going to be rough. Of course buying this stuff from the gas station got very expensive over time, so I started buying an extract online a couple of years ago to both save money and reduce the amount of nasty powder I would have to take every day. I have been taking 1g of extract BID, which is approximately equivalent to 30g of plain leaf a day. The kratom turned its head on me a couple of months ago and all of the energizing effects have gone away. I am completely emotionless, have no sex drive and feel ""blah"" constantly. My depression that was basically non-existent since getting off of benzos came back with a vengeance and I am almost certain it is due to my kratom use. 

There have been a few instances recently where I would forget to take my nighttime dose, and whenever I do I wake up with the worst withdrawals imaginable. I knew coming off of this stuff would probably be rough, but still I was literally shocked that I could feel this terrible from kratom withdrawal, which is supposed to be extremely weak compared to most other opiates out there. I know my high dose and extract make it worse, but I was not expecting the symptoms to be nearly this bad in any way, shape or form. My anxiety is so bad it feels like my heart is beating out of my chest, my eyes and nose run constantly like the floodgates just opened, I have horrible diarrhea and nausea multiple times, I sweat like crazy followed by chills, my restless legs are absolutely horrific and my entire body is in severe pain. And this is only at the 24 hour mark of being kratom free. I have never once gone longer than 24 hours without taking kratom since I first bought it years ago. 

Now that my psychiatry residency has ended and I just began my addiction medicine fellowship, I feel like a total hypocrite and a disgrace to the entire medical community. I consider myself a very smart and high functioning person, but I know that I would sink faster than a ship with a hole in it if I just decide to stop taking my Kratom. I kicked a horrible benzo addiction in undergrad, quit drinking socially a year ago, started working out and dieting hard at the start of COVID leading to me going from being obese to 155 lbs and I have only 1 year left until I am done my fellowship and will be a completely autonomous practicing physician. I feel like everything in my life is going great right now except for the fact that I am taking a ridiculous amount of kratom and I feel like absolute shit when I don't take it. The time to quit this shit has come, but even as a physician with 4 years of a psychiatry residency underneath his belt and just starting an addiction medicine fellowship, I really have no idea how to go about getting off of this the best way, especially given my profession. 

It is actually crazy how many doctors in my field don't even know what kratom is. The obvious ""correct"" medical choice for me according to the current literature would be for me to get onto Suboxone for opiate use disorder, but I strongly feel that even subs are generally stronger than kratom, I do not want to be on any other drugs in the future and I don't want anybody knowing I am dependent on this stuff. I am so dedicated to getting off this stuff, and the fact that I began taking it initially as a coffee replacement and not to get high makes me feel very confident that once I am finally off of it I will never go back, similarly like me with the Xanax. I am also terrified of getting labeled as an addict while being an MD as I can very well be disciplined by the DEA and even permanently lose my license to practice medicine. Detox can be an option for me too, but due to what I said above I would have to pay for it out of pocket and go somewhere far away because I don't want any history of opiate use disorder tied to my name and possibly my medical license, especially because my job entails me to treat OUD and prescribe Suboxone. If I were to go to detox, at the most I would probably be able to get one week off total from my entire yer in fellowship. Based on what I have read on this subreddit, I am in for a world of hell given my dose and the fact that I am on an extract. Tapering slowly will probably cause me a lot of pain for a decently long time and I am sure the withdrawal effects of a taper will be enough to raise eyebrows. Another option I think I have is to do a self detox at home as I can most likely somewhat easily obtain most of the normal comfort meds used for opiate detox. I am just really at a loss at what to do here to get off of this stuff without anybody ever finding out. If anybody has any advice on what the best course of action might be for me to get off of this stuff the best way, or even just to say ""dude you are an addiction doctor and an addict yourself, what the fuck is wrong with you?"" I would appreciate literally anything because I hate that I have put myself in this situation and I am so afraid, ashamed and totally disgusted with myself. I am fucking terrified of coming off of kratom and I do not know what to do.",38,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.6215584874153137}"

I'm on Day 2 CT from 25-40gpd, for over a year - started when I was writing my thesis. Tried tapering - really didn't work for me, last week I tried CT and managed for about 30 hours. I was feeling really bad at hour 30, and just couldn't resist so I ran to the Shop :(.  I don't know exactly what's different this time, but I'm almost feeling normal? I took some vitamins this morning, drank a green juice, started eating plant-based this week after reading some positive things about it, and voila! Even those horrible restless legs are gone, and I'm even able to work. At my last attempt, I was honestly nothing but a useless piece of garbage on day two, counting the hours, thinking of nothing but the K, and now, there's nothing of that?   


I know this might change, so I wanted to ask kindly if you would be willing to share a few points about what you hated most about taking Kratom?   


For me, it was definitely social isolation! When you're always euphoric doing whatever you are doing like sitting on a computer after taking some kratom, you never had the urge to go hang out with friends.  At least that's what I felt, and in the end my girlfriend started feeling that too! Also I always had the worst hangovers from it. I'm only 22, but every morning I felt like I was 80 and had a few too many shots of tequila the night before!

Going in CT and taking the leap of faith.,"Two weeks ago I was at a peak of a large Mitra gaia bag(250gr) I'm not sure exactly, in 3-5 days. Of about 2 years of kratom use. I remember a small 1 oz bag would last me a full week, then to a couple days, 1 day, 2 bags a day until I realized I was wasting too much money and it would be cheaper to go with the large bag.

A large bag started out lasting two weeks but deep down I knew the inevitably of tolerance and the dreaded day 1 big bag only lasts a day. So I tried tapering and quitting cold turkey with disastrous results. 

Ultimately I realized it wasn't possible to taper or stop while working a full time job which I needed every dollar of because I'm a poor loser. You can probably figure out what happened so I just relapsed and just continued on with taking kratom.

Two weeks ago I bought a ticket and I know where I'm going kratom is illegal and there is no opiates to speak of to help with taper so I went all out buying supplements. So I started tapering and started taking Magnesium, Vitamin C, Vitamin D-12, ,Ashwaganda, Biotin, L Theanine, Valerian Root, Melatonin.

They helped significantly but still the withdrawal symptoms, restless uncomfortability, inability to sleep, fatigue, excessive yawning, concrete legs, tingling extremities etc... Was still too much to deal with without taking enough kratom to hush the withdrawal.

Now I'm going on a long plane flight with only cough medicine (dextromophan), melatonin, Valerian Root, L Theanine, Diphenhydramine, A couple kava pills.

Will these be enough to curb the harshest points of the inevitable coming withdrawal? Any tips or recommendations I can get to help when I get off so I can function?

Thanks,

Best decision I've EVER made.,"If you're a current user and you're thinking about quitting- do it. Do it as soon as possible. Don't wait, like I did. Don't let the addiction keep it's grips in you. Don't let it ruin your life, like it almost did mine.
Kratom will leave you completely drained of everything. I had no executive function, no motivation, no energy. I was just zonked out, clocked out, spaced out; 24/7. Drinking green water and orange juice to keep myself from going through withdrawals. Towards the end, I was taking it hourly. I was at the point that I still felt symptoms of withdrawal even after taking a normal dose, and would have to take more. I've known enough heroin addicts to know that this was bad. This was late stage addiction, and I was at a fork in the road; take more, and more, or quit. I even considered going to something stronger. Laying in pain, sweating, even after taking a dose, I thought multiple times about getting full-blown opiates. Painkillers, heroin, anything to make me feel better. 
I made the decision to quit March 20th, 2021. I wasn't planning on it. I sat down with my coffee, noticed I only had two doses left, and started to panic. And then, calm. I realized that I didn't HAVE to take this any more. I could simply stop. Go through the withdrawals, deal with it, and quit. I've quit alcohol, xanax, vicodin, all of them coming with withdrawals and pain, so I figured I could handle this. My mom encouraged me to get rid of my last two doses and just get it over with, so I went against every nerve in my body and flushed them. I hadn't dosed since 12 hours prior, and was already feeling the awful feeling we all know and love. I was at the bottom of a cliff face, looking up at the facade. Thinking ""There's no way I can climb this.""

The hardest part of my withdrawals were the first 7 days. I felt pain. I was sweaty, but cold. I got chills constantly. I was exhausted, completely exhausted. It was definitely not good. But, it's not the worst thing I've ever experienced. It felt like a bad flu. I was certainly sick, and it was annoying, but please; if the withdrawals scare you, don't let it. My FEAR of the withdrawals were much worse than the withdrawals themselves.

20 days later, I'm still going through withdrawals a bit, though not as badly. My motivation and executive function has almost completely returned; it's like a miracle. I can do things, accomplish things. I'm finishing crochet and embroidery projects that I've been working on for 6+ months, that should've only taken a couple of weeks. I cleaned my room and unpacked boxes (I moved into this house 4 months ago and never unpacked.) I'm wearing make up again. 

My mood is a little up and down, though more up than down. I'm scared of the depression that may come, but I know I'll weather that as well.

Thank you for reading this long ass post. If you're addicted to this shit, and you're thinking about quitting- DO IT! When you're ready, of course. But please, do it. It's so much better on this side of the addiction.",72,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9960893392562866}"

3. Only was taking Kratom consistently for about 8-9 months
4. I am Rx'd Gabapentin & Valium for GAD, obviously those help.
5. I admitted to my psychiatrist and therapist about my use, and that I wanted off. I had their support.
6. My psychiatrist Rx'd me 1mg Guanfacine, which I took once before bed each night. It is patented to help with opioid withdrawal, similar to clonidine but not as strong.
7. I don't drink coffee. Only Green Tea.
8. I take \~100mg of CBD in my tea, each morning.
9. Exercise. Just going for 2-3 mile walks helped a lot.
10. Staying busy.
11. Playing music.

I've only been taking kratom for about 6 months. I started and really loved the motivation and chattiness but started to notice that the come down made me feel like an empty she'll of a human. I was taking 3.5g of green Malay 2x a day and 3.5g of red bali in the evening to chill out.

I started having crazy digestive issues last month and discovered I have been lactose intolerant and making myself sick for a while. The kratom helped with IBS and anxiety so I took my regular dosage without a whole lot of food. **Add a uti and stomach spasms to the list

Well Monday it clicked that maybe the kratom wasn't my friend after all. My hair has been falling out and I've had no motivation. I'm bitchy all the time. I stopped after my 2nd dose of the day.


I haven't slept much and my gi tract is miserable. I cry over the dumbest shit and I feel like I'm one half in a panic attack. I have weird pin prick pains in my guts.

On top of the withdrawal, I started taking antibiotics for the stupid UTI. I feel so yucky.


I've been taking clonidine was needed but my bp is low anyway so I only take it when I'm in range. It helps a lot but I'm scared to take it as needed. I tried unisom for sleep and it's not helping. I've also been taking magnesium, ashwaganda and l-tyrosine.

I don't have a good reaction to antihistamines or anything that fucks with serotonin so I stay away from melatonin (it doesn't do much anyway)

I want to quit now and never get myself into a situation where I need to be carefully tuning substances and worrying about interactions just to ""make it through these few months"".

Anyway, I have been taking kratom daily for almost exactly 2 months. My doses were 6-10g, but usually around 8g a day (4g x 2 in the evening/night time).

I am scared of withdrawals. Last few months have been hell, I have been all alone in a new place, doing extremely difficult work. I want to be able to enjoy my summer, I am scared of withdrawals.

Overall today was mostly just a baseline day 2. For the last 48 hours I just recorded my intake of Kratom. To get a sense where I'm at. Although I did exert some effort today to dose less than yesterday, I didn't fully restrict myself and put myself in withdrawal. As you can see my withdrawal scores are pretty low. Tomorrow is going to be my real first challenge because tomorrow I limiting myself. The most important part of tonight's post is this sentence right here where I put it down on paper my max dose of Kratom for tomorrow.

My total dosage of Kratom for tomorrow will not exceed 36 grams.  There I said it. 36 grams will be the max dose for tomorrow.

&#x200B;

Ok so I've made commitments to taper in the past and  they have all failed--but this time I'm putting it down on paper-- and I'm hoping with the power of the community I can take my life in a big direction tomorow and only ingest 36 grams.  I understand this is a big jump from what I normally take but given the logarithmic nature of opioid receptor dose effect curves-- I don't have time to taper much slower than this.  There is a big chance that I may be in charge of performing a series of surgeries at the end of April and I need to be off Kratom by then. I cannot be sweating and freezing in the middle of a surgery where students are trying to learn from me.  Lets not think about that now

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get through those moments where I want to take more than I'm allowed to tomorrow? What is your strategy for wanting to take more because

1. I don't feel good (withdrawal)  \*takes more kratom\*
2. I feel fine withdrawal wise, but want to feel better than fine, I want to feel really good \*takes more kratom\*

&#x200B;

These two situations are different and both of them have caused me to fail a taper in the past.

As long as I can keep saying that, we're going to be a-okay. Hell, even a little bit worse wouldn't be the end of the world, still so worth it to be off this insidious drug.

Clarity of life is coming back slowly, I'm still working extremely full time, and today was the second busiest morning we've had in years, second only to yesterday (some first two days without kratom eh??) I've been saving up most of my xanax for this final quit, and I am glad I did.. Honestly I'm not even taking it for the anxiety really (only taking .25mg at a time, many hours apart, and never more than 2 a day), I take it but it's such a small dose that my anxiety is through the rough even still. I'm really only taking it to knock me out so I can fall asleep, and boy what a help it does for that. Probably won't take it longer than 2 weeks after quitting kratom, I cannot handle withdrawing off of that too!

I feel like garbage but I feel like a new man. I'm not finding new joy in things I was numb to before, but I'm feeling no worse than I was at even my highest dose of kratom (minus the withdrawals obviously), I definitely don't miss it at all. I for real started getting a runny nose today, and was even glad about it, now I know I am fully on the right path. For the last 5 or 6 years, I dieted to intermittent fasting where I only eat one big meal once every 24 hours (also I was not eating to maximize the effects of taking kratom on an empty stomach). But since I started tapering I have been eating more frequently, brain healing requires nutrition, and kratom and not eating suck the life out of that... Still sweating like crazy, and gaining lots of weight from changing my diet, lol ruining shirts that don't even fit me anymore. Still get these piercing headaches but they never last more than 10 minutes, so I am happy about that.

For those of you thinking of quitting, I'm an all or nothing guy 100%, but tapering was definitely the best route for me on this. And if you're thinking you can't do it, you definitely can! My sorry ass did it, and I was at 70 grams per day 4 months ago! Haven't skipped a dose in over half a decade. Believe me, I spent the majority of days the last 4 months feeling like death and almost told my wife to take me to the hospital or rehab dozens of times, just tough it out! Every person is different, but we all know this is going to suck royally to get off of... I don't have any of the ""get high on life"" rewards yet, but just knowing that I am the same person if not better off this stuff completely is reward enough as is.

Sunday I spent day with them and rather effortlessly didn’t use kratom.  Felt some chills and low energy but full heart.  Sadly right after they left the next day I compulsively went to head shop for an ounce of powder, a daily ritual basically.  Spent Monday thru yesterday chasing that nauseating buzz.

Stayed up late last night watching Anthony bourdain but woke too early.  Very tired and moody and think on some level I finally hit my kratom bottom.  Till that point some part of me was still holding on or just was ok with the procrastination of dosing.. just one more time.  That always means weeks, months, or years.. 

Maybe it’s been that I’ve finally been talking about this.. maybe it was the group last week going over 12 steps and finally accepting I am powerless to ever use kratom ‘responsibly’. Maybe it helps some but for me it’s been paying to be a constipated, moody, limp zombie .  Daily use is a slow self poisoning and the terrible, toxic side effects just build with each dose.

Maybe it’s that I’m being so humbled I genuinely reached for that higher power.  Prayer and meditation.  Who knows... but right now I see a clear Door and Path out of this bullshit kratom powder life.  Fuck that shit, I’m done .

It was the best thing that happened to me, I was able to be my best self and find extra motivation and bubbly energy to do have a successful day.

Thing is, i don’t know why it took me waaay to long to realize when it stopped being that for me and started being exactly the opposite, making me tired, angry and resentful, withdrawn and numb, constantly grabbing that baggie to solve that, and that never-ending cycle has been pretty much what my life has been these last years.

What I didn’t expect was the withdrawal symptoms. I had stopped taking kratom many times before, just because I had run out and didn’t want or couldn’t buy more, and didn’t even noticed withdrawals. In retrospective, I’m sure I had that runny nose and goosebumps and lethargy every time and I just attributed it to catching a cold or something.

Last week, after realizing how much of a zombie I progressively came to become, I tried to stop CT, and soon enough, the runny nose, the chills, the cold, the sweat, the even lower energy and sadness.

Three days later and I decided to change my strategy to tapering off, I just couldn’t stand being that useless bag of moans and complaints around my daughter.

I’m afraid about taking it again, and to fool myself to think that I’m tampering off while I’m just looking forward excuses to keep taking it, but I think and hope this is not the case.

Today I came down to one dose a day, in the afternoon, just when the wds start getting intense. 

I’ve been getting emotional over songs or stupid movies (I was crying like a baby today watching a Johnny Knoxville’s movie, lol), specially the hours before my dose, and I’m actually enjoying it, this sudden surge of emotions reminds me of how emotionless kratom kept me, and I feel kinda sad when I have to take my dose, knowing the chills and runny nose will go away, but this emotional aliveness too. It makes me really excited to look forward to when I am totally rid of the K, and start having my emotions, energy and self-esteem back.

Sorry for making this so long, but I discovered this thread a few days ago and today I couldn’t stop crying reading so many inspiring stories and realizing that this is just the way it goes, but that it can get done and that it is possible to get back to that healthy , joyful, energized person I used to be.

I still get heart palpitations but not nearly as bad I really feel like hydration helps the heart a lot especially gatorade chug a whole one before bed you will feel so much better in the morning. Penis definetly got bigger as well soft and hard. I did not wake up super light headed and dizzy for the first time also. My sleep was actually better on day 8 than yesterday but that could be because I haven't had any caffeine in 3 days. First 6 days I was drinking one pepsi a day. Exercise is important also I was insanely out of shape I still am but even walking 30 minutes will help you. I've been walking while dribbling a basketball. Sports was always my outlet as a kid so it helps clear my mind more than just walking. I was down to 8-10 cigs but I did smoke 12 last night just couldn't get my body to rest. Once I am through this I will stop smoking cigs and plan to just drink chinese red tea and some green tea. May experiment with one glass of black coffee in the morning once I am cutting the cigs as well. I just want everyone to know you can do this I've never been addicted to anything and I didnt do it nearly as long as anyone 8 weeks but I was doing around 15gpd towards the end toss n wash destroyed my gut but it's almost completely normal. so I may not know as much as everyone but I just want to show people that their is light at the end of the tunnel. So far I've cut out weed kratom and caffeine. I know when I cut cigarettes for tea I'll get nicotine and caffeine but I do not see tea as a negative unless you are bulk drinking it for nicotine and caffeine.,8,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9751051068305969}"

Its been giving me the biggest boosts of serotonin and as i did feel the withdrawal symptoms this dramatically reduced them.

2 days CT , my FACE is NOT bloated anymore, my LEGS are NOT BLOATED, HEAVY anymore. and MY BRAIN i think was swollen.  I used kratom green slime drink , started 3 times a day maybe 3 grams, to every hour green powdered 1/4 or more teaspoons!! got worse in 2021, AND MY HEADEACHES were triggered and FELT MY HEAD BRAIN LIKE SWOLLEN!     last nite, i had restless legs, diffinitely TINGLING NEEDDLES sensation all over by back!! maybe the SPINAL CORD/VERTEBREA??   

today my 2nd day COLD TURKEY, no kratom. THREW OUT CLOSE TO 200 GRAMS UNOPEN KRATOM!! and this MORNING 2nd day I FEEL SOOOOO DIFFERENT! I FEEL LITE WEIGHT!  MY Personality feels calmer, peaceful, clear minded. MY LEGS!!! are easy to MOVE!!!!! again!!! feel skinny!  My FACE jawline I can see NOW!! definitely kratom affects the LYMPH NODES! AND dryness all over my body, eyes, ears, dry face!! and hair scalp ALREADY FEELING BETTER! kRATOM takes all the OIL OUT OF YOUR BODY! 

I LOST lots of eye brows, eye lashes, and some hair . my hair after  4yrs usage is dryer, brittle, super thin and lost some of it for sure.

kratom also causes Parasites in the stomach! worms!! I did lots of coffee enemas because of ALL THE CONSTIPATION KRATOM CAUSES! POOP TURNS TO ROCKS!  and definitely had long worms come out of me from the Capsules I bought at the Gas Station!! 

2nd day i was able able to go to the bathroom with no issues after going for a  3 miles walks i hadnt done in a long time.   and what my poop smelled like was GREEN KRATOM POWDERED!

MY EYE BALLS DONT FEEL AS DRY TOO! All the energy, euphoria, and social personality kratom gave me stats to wear off in a couple of years for me, so i starte using more, and it SCARED ME! because it is a TOXIN! POISON damages liver and kidneys.

I felt tingling on it then I felt LOOSER!!!! and no more PRESSURE against by neck n head.

This is the longest I’ve ever stayed off of kratom and I feel confident I’m going to kick it for good.

Some of you may have seen a post I made a few days ago, in the last year I had some real bad substance abuse problems. At my worst I was using Oxycodone 120mg 3x a day, Meth at around 150mg a day, and 20mg xanax or 40mg etiz to sleep at night. I did this for around 4 months, had around a 4 month stint of abusing serotonin stims (4-FA, MDMA, 5-MAPB, 4-MMC). I was using Kratom for 100-200 grams a day for the last 2 years (except for the point where I used oxy). 

I’m not sure exactly when I quit Kratom but I know I’ve been having withdrawals for a week now because I checked my browser history to see when I almost bought a new batch when I started feeling withdrawals, and that was last Thursday. I’ve quit everything else last summer (except the benzos obviously I had to taper I started tapering around august with 200mg Valium and am at around 10mg at night currently so I’m getting close to finishing).

The acutes are mostly gone, my stomach still hurts quite a bit and I have some chills and sneezes every once in a while but it’s not really noticeable anymore.

Last night I had a dream I got a new job at a department store. A coworker kept talking to me and I kept having a hard time hearing her so I'd ask ""what?"" And she'd repeat herself. She made a snarky comment on how she's gonna have to get used to repeating herself. 

I went on break with this coworker along with this girl I went to high school with that I haven't seen in years, I haven't even thought about her so it was random. Anyway, the coworker was asking me why I was having trouble hearing. In the dream I was withdrawing badly, my head was hurting, I was tired, and I was having a hard time paying attention. So I flat out admitted to her that I quit kratom and was going through withdrawals. Then I looked on the table and saw a scale with some kratom on top of it (I don't remember if it was some capsules or powder..pretty sure it was capsules and some powder was smeared on the scale). 

I pointed out ""wait, isn't that kratom right there?"" Both girls laughed and said yes they love taking it to get through the day. I laughed and made a comment about the green dust being smeared everywhere and how I don't miss that. Then the dream was over. 

A few days or so before I quit, I had a dream that I was trying to take my dose, and no matter where I went, people were around. I couldn't find a place to dose alone so I weighed out my dose on the scale and took it in front of people (toss and wash).

I know that's the opposite of many people on here but work is busy as hell and generally takes my mind off of things, sitting around on the couch makes me feel worse (and no, I don't want to go out and find something to do, that's not some new breaking ground to my identity, laying around is still my favorite thing to do) oh but I still went for my bike ride just now :) that's not going to change anytime soon

I feel pretty shitty, sweating like crazy (that's been the case for the last few weeks), skin feels like it's on fire, restless, anxiety and panic attacks... But realistically, it's really not worse than it has been for the last few months. I don't want to freak out too much thinking it's because I have taken zero kratom, I can be honest with myself and say really and truly, it's kind of the same. And truthfully we've been doing the drops once every 7 days, and this is a drop 3 days after dropping, so yeah I kind of knew it was going to suck, any time we do a drop early my life basically feels like it's over lol. But all of the stressors that pop up in the day (and there are a lot of them) are really just the same ones I didn't deal with before starting kratom, and didn't handle well even at my highest dose of kratom.

Things I'm grateful for thus far: 

Not having to base my entire day around a kratom fiend schedule

Not throwing up my food halfway through dinner because I took too much kratom and shaking it off like it's no big deal because it happens all the time

Not spending the crazy amount of money I was each month on a drug that I feel pretty much the same without

My back pain (it was WAY worse a few weeks ago) not being as bad without kratom as I thought it would be

I’m 23F, this summer will mark 4 years of me using this shit, spending most of my adult life thus far being a literal “shell of who I once was”. I shot my self in the foot. From 17-19 I was shooting heroin, I struggled with such bad depression & PTSD my entire teen years, which is what ultimately lead me to sticking a needle in my arm. I was lucky enough to quit heroin cold turkey & never relapse, not to mention the fact that I survived heroin addiction is a blessing in itself. When I got sober from heroin, my life became better than I ever thought it could be. But I chose to start taking Kratom, this seemingly harmless, non addictive substance, not even a year into my sobriety from heroin. I became addicted to Kratom almost immediately, & in my personal experience, it’s been so much harder to get off of this than it was hard drugs. I’ve been taking anywhere between 25-50 grams a day for the last three years. I’m sick skinny again, I’m gaunt looking, I’m a recluse, I’m always tired & I don’t even recognize myself in the mirror at all. I am no stranger to the “eye wobbles” & dizziness that sets in when I take too much Kratom on a near empty stomach, so when I am at work & I begin to get the dizziness, it doesn’t alarm me too much. Last Wednesday (so exactly a week ago) I was at work, I began to have vertigo and eye wobbles. An hour later, I was still dizzy. Then, I went to lunch, managed to eat some food & prayed it would subside. You guys. What happened next has traumatized me. I come back in from lunch break, dizziness like crazy. I don’t remember anything that happened in the next 5 minutes. I woke up on the concrete floor at work, surrounded by supervisors & paramedics telling me to not get up. I was so confused and out of it, I asked them “why?”. They told me I passed out, face first into the concrete floor. I was unresponsive for a couple minutes after passing out, & then I went into a full blown seizure that lasted for 3 minutes. I’m still in shock. I had to go to the ER, & everything in my blood & brain looked okay, other than being low on protein. But I no longer can drive my car, & can not operate machinery either (which is what I do for a living). I know it’s temporary, but I feel like my entire life is just turned upside fucking down. People at my work thought I was dying & a lot of them were terrified seeing me in that state. I have no family history of seizures and no personal history of seizures either. I’m scared of what this plant is doing to my body & psych. I’ve known for the last few years that I am damaging myself, but I still can’t believe this happened. I have been reading some of the other posts on here regarding seizures, & I’m not alone. I need off of this horrible fucking ride so bad, but it’s so hard when I wake up in the morning covered in sweat, withdrawing so bad that it feels like I can’t even pull myself out of bed. I am ashamed. I used to be so much stronger than this, even as a heroin addict. I am just at a loss. There’s no way out other than to quit, I’ve known it for years yet here i am. I apologize for the long post, I just want to cry & I don’t trust anyone else to talk to about my addiction. I just struggle in silence & it is breaking me down. I love this sub & all your guys supportive comments and posts. We are NOT alone, we’ve got each other’s back throughout our personal struggles with this demon plant. Fuck Kratom. I can’t keep ruining my life with this shit. I want my life back, my genuine happiness, my healthy body, I even want my EYES BACK, my normal eyes that aren’t glassy with pinprick pupils.

So I took time off work and quit ct last month, starting March 8, made it about 2 weeks and caved.

(100% not worth it, btw, all my progress went out the window instantly, my tolerance shot back up, crushing shame and regret, I immediately stopped writing in my daily journal, working out, and practicing music... p much every single good thing I had gained in those 2 weeks went to shit, and fast)

I was on about 3, sometimes up to 5, of those 20$ extract shots a day for several years. 

So I fell back into using, and I was very quickly right back where I started. Except this time I thought I was totally fucked, since I'd already taken my time off of work, and my job is awful and dangerous to do while in withdrawals. (I'm a cross country trucker, I haul extremely expensive luxury cars, often working 15hrs a day)

I was trying to scheme ways to get more time off or just power through wds while working, when I suddenly got veryyy sick. Extreme sore throat, aches, fever(no cough, surprisingly). I was in Michigan working, and I live in Florida, so I had to drive my truck back, which was pretty brutal. 
But I got tested yesterday, and I'm positive for covid, which means I automatically get 2 weeks off PAID!
I'm pretty sick, but not dangerously so, and the best part is that when I take my normal dose, I feel incredibly lightheaded and dizzy. So I have an added natural incentive to not dose. 

Obviously I'm going to capitalize on this and view it as an incredible blessing, I probably would've ended up using for another year or 2 without this. I had a fraction of my normal dose today, and that's the last of it. I'm gonna give my brother my car keys as soon as he gets off work, and I'm miles away from town, so I'll be quite effectively quarantined, for both covid and kratom purposes.

One more thing, I'm researching getting vivitrol shots for a few months, does anyone have any experience using these for kratom?
I'm a former heroin/meth/crack etc addict, and I've had more trouble quitting kratom than anything else. If there's a chance the shots will help me stay clean, then I'm all for it.",7,"{'covid': 3, 'quarantine': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9987137317657471}"

Any and all withdrawals I had experienced before I am not dealing with this time around. 

I plan on making this a short process and then tapering off of the methadone once I am sure I am done with the Kratom and it’s out of my system. 

It really feels like a cheat code. Of course I know I’m going to get lots of feedback but the important thing is that it is working for me. Kratom sucks! 

PS I have cold turkeyed off of 45 mg of methadone before from the same clinic. So I am ready for that when it comes. I am also trying to make this process as quick as possible so that no unnecessary addictions take place.

I did a very rapid taper with capsules that Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Previously, I had been around maybe 10 GPD, probably close to a year. What started to scare me is that I felt like my emotions were a ""house of cards"" and was trying to dose this nasty crap to maintain it - sometimes even regularly taking it wouldn't work, and the house of cards would collapse and feel extremely tired, lethargic, numb. I also did not like having to always remember to have my kratom with me, it gets expensive, and most of all - I started to get very scared at the thought I couldn't even remember how many times I would dose throughout the day - I'd wake up and dose, maybe one (or two) mid morning), one around lunch, one or two or three during the afternoon, one or two around dinner, and so on - a VERY slippery slope. I have recovered from benzo addiction before and I was determined to not become an addict again.  


So, what has worked? I have been taking modafinil 100mg x2 a day. That has given me energy and motivation in my option. I wouldn't recommend this as a long term fix, but maybe something to consider. Also, I have (for about 2 years now) been on 400mg gabapentin x4 a day. And been taking 500 mg magnesium, along with vitamin D and K (it was a multi capsule thing).

Withdrawals have been getting better - was obviously worse the first week but not unbearable as I thought. I think the moda helped me with that, since previous quits or just running out were marked by extreme tiredness and laying in bed for hours and hours too tired and heavy feeling to move.

Exercise is also a big thing. Helped me when I was having those back pains/RLS like symptoms. Now, day 10, they seem to be nonexistent! Lingering effects are a bit of tiredness (not nearly as bad), some lack of motivation (although these two symptoms seemed improved by moda, on days I take it - I don't recommend taking this long term or every day since effects diminish and its just another pill to take) , but hoping brighter days are ahead",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9974228143692017}"

I'm currently unemployed, applying and interviewing to jobs, and living with my girlfriend. I never was a super deep sleeper, but I only had one period of time in my life when I couldn't sleep well for more than one day once before in my life (that was about 6 months ago when we moved into a new apartment where we currently live and the sounds from the highway nearby kept me up). Anyways, I fixed that problem with white noise and blackout curtains, and it's been good since.

&#x200B;

**CURRENT SITUATION - ME BEING STUPID**

Recently, I was using kratom for several weeks, 3-4 times a week to help me crank through more job apps as I've been unemployed for so long, knowing that I shouldn't rely on drugs to help. I started having trouble falling asleep at night, so I stopped taking Kratom about a week ago.

Most nights I would toss and turn a lot, and after a few hours in bed I would start getting sweats that would come and go, and a heavy feeling on my chest, I keep noticing my heart beat racing, like I'm about to have a panic attack. I have to step away and sit down and just do nothing, or read for a while until I'm a little more calm. But this would repeat sometimes until 6 or 7am.

&#x200B;

**TRYING TO FIGURE MY SHIT OUT TO NO AVAIL**

I purchased some xanax to help me with sleep, because I had three interviews this week that I couldn't afford to have 0 sleep before. I've been relaxing as much as possible, exercising nearly everyday either at the gym or on a bike ride, spending time outdoors, meditating daily, and trying to stay optimistic. I almost always have some chamomile tea and melatonin before bed. Overall, during my day-to-day, my mood is improved, and I rarely feel these ""anxiety pangs"", maybe only once or twice a day and it goes away.

However, in the evening, they usually come back, and it's harder to sleep because of it. I finished my interviews, and my girlfriend is spending a few days at home with her parents so I can try my best to re-learn how to sleep on my own, and not rely on xanax to help me sleep. Last time I had insomnia, I needed two full nights of good sleep to re-learn it, so to speak.

&#x200B;

**I NEED HELP**

So, what I'm getting at is what else should I be doing to help me sleep better, and what to do when I feel these anxiety pangs that sometimes get so bad that I feel like I could have a heart attack? How do I come back to reality from them and how can I sleep again? Does Kava help? I'm trying to go drug-free whenever possible.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR: Having insomnia for the second time because I used kratom to affect my sleep about a week ago. Stopped using it but worried that it will affect my job interviews, relationship, and future career. Heart beats fast, feeling like I'll have a panic attack on some nights while trying to sleep.**",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9812620282173157}"

All kratom really does essentially is reduce the amount of information and sensations the brain takes in from its enviornment (this is a very general statement and kratom does have a complex and largely unknown pharmacology and mechanism of action) and thinking of what that does to a person long term is evidently not good. In a sense withdrawal is a whiplash or boomerang type of reaction to being cut off from ordinary sensory imputs for so long that any addicted person is hyper sensitive to all sensations and information recieved by the brain, compare it to someone whos been in the dark for a long time having a light blasted into their eyes, withdrawal is that happening to every sensation of the body not just the eyes. From everything being all closed up inside us all the time (think of shrinking pupils or how the skins pores close up and stop sweating when using kratom) we get so sensitive to reality that even the fucking air starts to feel like sand paper, even the light of the sun is like blazing your eyes with fire when your in the peak of kratom wds. I dont think anyone can hope to be spiritually sound under the disaster of kratom addiction, and this is one of my greatest concerns and reasons for quitting kratom. But I do also feel it can put a block on psychological or possibly physical development as well.",11,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.99899822473526}"

I'm a 15 - 20g a day user for about a year. My last dose was sunday night before going to bed. The next day I was doing fine until the evening (monday), that's where I started to feel the withdrawal. Some alcohol gave some relieve and was able to sleep a bit. The next day I felt absolutely miserable, but I just went through with it with the hopes this would be over soon. Last night I had a terrible night of sleep. The whole night RLS, sweating, feeling cold and then warm again... And today I feel even worse. The diarrhea started. I'm kind of hungry but still dont feel like eating.  I'm sitting inside with more layers of cloth on than ever and still can't get really warm. Or when I'm finally warm, it's too warm again. Yet sweating more than ever. I'm unable to work, to do anything really. I'm afraid it will be even worse tomorrow.

I will receive a package today with new kratom and I'm thinking if I should keep doing the CT thing or start tapering. Tapering feels a bit like a waste though after going through 2,5 days. I think I can get away with one, maybe two days of not performing well at work but I can't go on like this for long. 

So anyway, the reason why I'm making this post is to ask what someone else would do in my situation. Go on with the CT thing, feeling miserable for a few days and be done with it? How many more days will the physical withdrawal probably take for a user like me? The other option is to taper, be able to work, but not able to get this stuff out of my life yet. Would be a waste though if tomorrow is the day where I finally feel a bit better again, but I can't go on like this for too long.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9993653893470764}"

My Long, Slow Kratom Taper Hit 10g Mark Today! Two-Thirds The Way Home!","I was scared I wouldn't make it this far.  There is a brief sigh of relief.  I have not felt good and I have a feeling of dread.  However, I am dropping 2.5g every 8 days.   That's 1/8 teaspoon a day or .3125 a day.  I have a regulation 1/8 tsp.  I don't pack it and level it off.  I am using only one strain.  

Part of me wants to keep it here for three days before resuming my drop but I want to get away from this nastiness and start a clean life.  I want to start a clean life because my life has never been more difficult not including this controlling plant.  I just want out.  

My problems led to Kratom.  Kratom did not lead to my problems.  But now--all my problems seem totally impossible with Kratom.  

I know you understand.  

You understand because you have to carry on some kind of illusion that you are living when you actually are dying.  

I'm reluctant to do anything new.   The country is opening up from the Pandemic.  Lol!   And no, I'm not really laughing out loud.  But you gotta at least smile.  Final irony. 

My looks are shot--my face thin, my skin gray.  My mind is not working right anymore.  I don't remember what I do.  Did I dose my 9:00 PM dose?  No, I didn't because I feel like I'm late.  My body knows.  

Do you know I started using Kratom for pain as an alternative to pain pills.  The transition to escape drug happened fast.  I even fell into the group of self-liars who actually believe or try to believe Kratom is wonderful and pretty harmless.

Not for me.  It is the worst drug.  You can function on it while it eats you away.  It eats you away.  The silent killer.

So I sit and wonder should I take at least one more day at 10g?  Would one day even help?  

I will say this--I know a lot of my pain is because my life has hit me like a ton of bricks.  The regrets and the fear are so intense that I generally have no relief at all.  I can't think ahead.  I wont.  Just get off this junk.  Wow!

Do you ever look in the mirror and shake your head is disgust?  There's a line in the AA Big Book (The bible for alcoholics) that reads--

It is nice to feel again, but there are no good feelings. I have never experienced my motivational reward system so fucked up as I have this week. I’m still having minor withdrawals, but nothing mentally has changed except physically. There is no hope or joy at all. Not going to kill myself, not trying to be a bummer, just saying, even exercise gives me such little reward. It’s to the point where no food interests me and I’m force feeding myself bananas and protein shakes. Vegan for lent so I can’t choke down Greek yogurt or milk which are much more calories dense. It’s to the point where I’m not recovering from my workout, and constantly spiking my insulin with vit c juice, that I know I’m in muscle wasting mode and creating a negative feedback loop. God willing I will tan in the next Sunny day and start a positive feedback loop. 

It makes me think of trainspotting, the whole “better than sex scene”. 

Kind of thinking of getting a drug I don’t love so much and just cycling so I don’t get a physical dependence, but I’ve gotten so far away from that scene I’m really just forced to sit in bed not knowing what to do with myself, and say “only 2 hours til my night dose. Only 1 hour and 50 minutes until my night dose” etc etc. 

It is no wonder so many of our lives have fallen apart. That I could be so boring, live in such a mess, hide from my friends like Raskolnikov from crime and punishment, and just listen to so many hours of podcasts is a testament to how fucked my reward system is going to be for the next little while. The boredom is insane. 

Anyway, just some thoughts and bitching, hope you all are well. Don’t forget all of the times you got the spins, tremors, anxiety, shitting out footballs, depersonalization etc. At least you are a person now- if only an unhappy one.

This is relevant because it limits me in in some ways that I can tackle the problem that  I'm addicted to Kratom. I am also an alcoholic with 3.5 years of  sobriety. In my last post, which was very well receive here ( I got tons  of helpful comments. You all convinced me I need to quit. I highly recommend that if you didn't read my first post.

This is an alt account that I plan on using just to receive help quitting Kratom, and then hopefully to help others quit in the future (If I can ever get there)

So last night  I dumped out all the Kratom.  It was a huge moment for me.   Here is how the day 1 went.

I  woke up this morning in a relatively good mood, ready to quit, ready  for a new chapter.  The day started by receiving a text from someone who  I respect who hasn't talked to me in months.  The text read  ""Addictive\_Sorbet9,  you know when people ask me about you, do you know  what I say? I say the only thing you need to know about this guy is that  he doesn't quit and he doesn't fail--at anything.""

This  was quite the flattering text to dart into my mind as soon as I woke  up. I used it for motivation. I got out of bed by 5:30 got a shower, got  dressed. It was hard but I was thinking of some of the comments from my  last post to give me strength.  At this point it was around 7am and I  went into work. I was sweating and didn't feel great, and very cold but  it wasn't too bad.  I had a very important meeting at 1pm, and I figured  that if I looked sick I could just say it was a reaction to the covid  vaccine. 8am I get much colder. 9am I'm freezing and sweating. my shirt  begins to get very very wet, so I put a sweater over it to hide it. 10am  I'm still so cold and I put another sweater over it. I'm dripping sweat  onto my desk and more cold than I've ever felt in my life. The sweating  becomes obscene and I'm just dripping sweat onto my desk, I start to  get afraid that someone is going to see me like this. And I realize that  I'm only 11 hours after my last dose and that things will get worse.  I  can't handle it, I take an uber to the head shop and get a bag of  Kratom.  I'm proud that i made it 12 hours, but I CANNOT believe how  sick I was. This is unreal.  I'm doing around 40-60 gpd.  And  biologically I'm very senstive to drugs and withdrawals.  I withdraw  hard from everything.  When I quit alcohol I had to be hospitalized for  example.

So even though I was a  bit rude to some of you and adamant that I couldn't taper, I learned  that I will have to taper at least somewhat, and I will have to plan to  quit over a long weekend.  I cannot YOLO cold turkey off 60gpd.

Ok,

As my buddy had texted about me-- I will not fail and I will not give up. I just need another plan.

Given my schedule and patients and research projects, I project that the weekend of Friday 23rd will be an optimal time to quit.

So  I've got two weeks to taper.  I will not take longer than that because  the next opportunity for me to take a long weekend will be at the end of  May and I'm not going to take it that long.

I'm  going to start tomorrow with 40G.  To get a baseline.  I also plan on  tracking my blood levels of kratom along with symptomology using a 1  compartment kinetic model.  So I can get a sense of at what blood levels  I begin to feel withdrawal, begin to sweat at, what blood levels I  begin to get cold at.

Any helpful advice would be great. Holy crap! I cannot believe how sick I got!

Now that I've quit kratom (DAY 30 CT HOLY SHIT I HAVEN'T COUNTED IN A WHILE) I feel like I'm hyperaware of all the little dopamine rushes we get from various things throughout the day. Especially in the beginning, my brain would try to binge these things to try (and fail) to achieve some sort of high and try to avoid feeling sad, pain, or any negative emotion really.

Some of these things have included alcohol, coffee, internet, and sugar. I usually drink 1-3 cups of coffee per day (even before kratom) but since quitting I've been drinking more and noticed just how detrimental the ups and down throughout the day are. Now I plan to quit that too this week.

What things other than kratom have you struggled with since quitting? Did you allow yourself to eat sugar to take your mind off kratom withdrawals? For me, kratom was by far and above the most detrimental thing to my life. It numbed everything and my daily activities were centered around dosing, but I think these other things can sometimes distract us from the ultimate goal of quitting kratom and becoming healthier versions of ourselves.

It’s not been that bad for me. I think it will start to get bad tomorrow because I am definitely doing a rapid taper.

Guanfacine 1mg at night, makes me sleepy and keeps blood pressure normative. 

Gabapentin 2x a day, 600mg. One in the morning and one at noon. 

CBD tea. 90-120mg. I usually mix it with kava or chamomile for the anti-anxiety effects. See the dosage amount. You have to get it up there for it’s powerful effects.

Yesterday I tried to see how long I could go without taking more Kratom and I broke out in hives starting from my wrist up to my neck. I've tried several types of allergy meds like Claratin, Benadryl, and zyrtec including skin creams but they just get worse and worse.

Edit: I learned the real cause of my hives. We had gotten a bonsai tree a few months ago and for some reason my allergies to it only went into overdrive around the time my Kratom dose was getting nearly 0. Removing the plant from the house and doing some good vacuum has cleared up my itching/hives nearly 100%, it had nothing to do with the Kratom. The weird thing is that for some reason 4 kinds of antihistamines don't do anything for the hives but somehow Kratom reversed them temporarily so I was positive the cause was Kratom related.

I used to live in Florida a mile and a half from Kratom Valley. I could get it any time I wanted even when I didn’t want to. The non stop urge to quit while being driven by the other more potent urge to continue this illusion of satisfaction. I can’t believe I’m still on this garbage. It’s been over 10 years of doing this giant at who knows what dosage anymore. When you get to the point where your pouring into your mouth three to sometimes four gulps at a time just to find that feeling again, it gets kind of old. This search for a green dragon that is always running. I would try and get off and find myself hooked to other things like Gabapentin and tramadol and loperamide and God knows what else. I know it helps others but I’m at the core a true addict searching for something to escape the emotional chaos that rings within my being. Cold turkey seems like the only way. I moved to AL and found ZaZa, a demon all of its own, something I can’t even begin to fathom. The withdrawal from tianeptine and phenibut was so much I found myself driving and hour away to get the green dragon to save me from that. Hence the cycle begins again and I find myself back on top of him riding him into my next detox. NOW IS THE TIME! I gave my car keys to my sister, my wife took my money and now I’m beginning a journey of dread that I can’t believe I’m doing once again. My last dose was at 3am this morning and I’m not at all excited about what’s coming. I’ve always said I can taper but I literally have no discipline.

The mental framework for people struggling,"I wanted to address some things i've noticed on here for people who are in the depths of withdrawals and PAWS. My hindsight after going through, and still going through, the effects of quitting kratom. One of the most overlooked aspects about quitting kratom is the psychological and mental framework needed to help ease your suffering. First, STOP TRYING TO STOP SUFFERING. That sounds ridiculous, i know. There's this thing Alan Watts first coined called 'the law of reverse effort'... Mark Manson wrote about in his book the subtle art of not giving a fuck: ""the desire for a more positive experience, is itself a negative experience. And paradoxically, the acceptance of one's negative experience is itself a positive experience"". The more you try to change the fact you feel like shit....only makes it harder to not feel like shit. Isn't that why we all started kratom? Because of ""a desire for a more positive experience""? Where did that lead us to? Feeling even more like shit. I want you to try to frame your suffering as the lesson you are learning, the hard way, to not chase that ever elusive dragon of pleasure all the time, especially as means to distract you from the physical, psychological, and or emotional wounds that needs be healed properly....not band-aided with a substance. This might sound preachy or whatever, but i truly believe most of our suffering in this life is where the most valuable lessons are learnt. So i ask you, don't automatically try to change how you're feeling....sit with it, contemplate it, familiarize yourself with it.....even become friends with it. That takes the power away from it. Remember, the mental frame work you build will determine the outcome of your journey. Never forget, you're not alone...it might feel that way but just look on here how many people on the same journey as you...albeit at different times on that journey...but the same journey nonetheless. So for people who are in the early stages wondering WHEN THE FUCK WILL I FEEL BETTER? You will, don't focus on that...focus on the lessons you are learning RIGHT NOW...in the present moment....because that's all we ever have. I'm right here if you ever need to talk. Much love to each and everyone of you....STAY THE COURSE! You're on your way to getting your life back",25,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8615540266036987}"

The one thing kratom did do was increase my water consumption. Was a constant coke drinker since I was 25 now 33. I have drank around 1 coke a day if that now. Because I'm severely dehydrated since quitting and am still working on getting my gut right and still working on having normal stool. Anyways the only symptoms I'm having are random heart palpitations and severe dehydration. I started yesterday using meal replacement shakes mens one a day and one bottle of Gatorade per day and I usually buy a gallon of spring water every other day. My better half has introduced me to drinking warm water when I wake up before lunch and after bed it has helped my gut a ton. My cigarette intake has went down a ton as well went from a pack a day to 8-10 smoke more when I'm bored end of day or when waking up. With my emotions and everything being more clear. I've never had a personal doctor besides when I was in the military but I was in such great shape then and ate so well I never really got these issues unless I was stupid and didnt eat or drink enough the prior night and the morning when we would have the running test. Severe shaking I think I sweat out a ton of salt more than normal people. The most I've done for workout yet is dribble a basketball up and down the street a few times. Still worried about spinning out of co trolls until i can get my body functioning normally. Afraid to start shaking and spinning out. Anyways people I'm glad to be off this stuff going through this withdrawl has helped me cut out a lot of negative stuff I've done in my life to my body. I was always the type with a huge ego who thought he knew it all and could handle anything. I just hope I can slowly make my body healthier and stronger than ever for my daughter and wife.

That was 12 years ago and my tolerance has increased past my prescribed dose which is 3 mg a day and I have an opportunity to go to a particular Institute that does a long term rapid detox however they will not perform this detox unless Kratom is out of my system-
appropriately so...
I was told instead of coming down for a benzodiazepine detox I would have to firstly come down for a Kratom  detox
 —- here’s the rub: 
my family and I cannot afford both so I am about to cold turkey Kratom.
I began taking Kratom just over two years ago, I take about 4-6g 4/5x a day (at max, sometimes 3-4 or 3-5 it really depends on my day etc)... 
(I began taking the Bali Kratom to supplement anxiety mood and pain from Lyme)...
My date to begin the benzodiazepine detox is April 25 of this year 2021 today is April 6, 2021.
I have a conference call with the lead doctor of the Institute this evening to see if he will accept my cold turkey detox of Kratom, here at home, so that I can get the help I really truly need of a 12 year benzo dependence that is and has been ruining my life for a few years now. I have the comfort of home and time away from work to do this [luckily]..

I am aware of the withdrawal symptoms and timeline but I see so many fluctuating answers in regards to my question above I see some say a few days which makes no sense to me and others say up to six or nine weeks which seems like quite a bit.
Anyone have definitive info on what would be clinically considered ‘out of system’ so I can be admitted???
I understand I’m in a very short time frame and it may not be possible but I was hoping to get some answers in addition to what the doctor says and of course ultimately his word will be the final judgment however I was just hoping for some extra information thank you in advance.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9985173344612122}"

I was sitting in a Wendy’s drive through, mid day, on a Monday, daydreaming, and looking at the colorful art on the exterior of a head shop across the parking lot. All of a sudden, a little light bulb went off, and I recalled a mental note I had made a year ago to try Kratom sometime, after hearing about it on the Joe Rogan podcast. 

Well, I bought a small amount, and consumed 4 grams right then and there. Wow. Not what I was expecting. I felt better than I had felt in a long time. No anxiety. Daydreams. Just kinda nodding off later that day at my work desk. I reiterate, unexpectedly pleasant. 

I took 4 grams the next morning. Similar, but not as good as the day before. Took 4 more grams. Eh. Started researching dosages online. Hmmm, okay, so like 10 grams should be good. Took two 10 gram doses each day, Wednesday and Thursday. 

Wow , not feeling so great anymore. “Gotta stop tomorrow to see if I can lower my tolerance”. Friday morning= pounding headache. Laying on the floor in the bathroom at work. Wow, I think I have the flu. Spent the next 4 days at home, aching, pounding headache, and a decent fever. Dizzy. I went and got a COVID test. Not COVID. Must be some other bug. 

I go back to work Wednesday of the next week, and take 4 grams. I feel great again. Over the next 4 days, I take 8 grams per day in two 4 gram servings. I decide to quit again this last Saturday. Sick as crap, and dizzy by Saturday night. Can’t get off the couch Sunday. Today, I went to work, but I have a fever again, and am experiencing brain zaps like you would get from withdrawals off an SSRI. Fuck Kratom. This crap isn’t worth this.

I'm a 46 year old man.   I've never been addicted to heavy drugs like coke, heroin, or pills.  But I've always had something my entire adult life that I used.

From 17 to 21 I was a big stoner.   Then I joined the USMC, the pot was done for those years but the drinking was heavy and consistent.   From the time I got out until about 32 or 33 I was a drinker. When I went to the local bar, you knew I would be there till last call.  

Somewhere in those post Marine Corps years I discovered Kratom.  Some local head shop sold liquid kratom,  I dont know if we can mention name brands here, but it was from a vendor that I haven't seen in well over a decade.  Not the brands people commonly use nowadays. 

Curiosity got the best of me, and we know how that ended for the cat.   It was blissful.  Very uphoric and relaxing.  It was an ocassional thing then.   Maybe once a week on a weekend night.  I loved it since it made me not drink.  Alcohol was always a dark cloud to me.  Drinking was a family problem for some on the Irish side of the family.  I loved and hated it, I was funny and wild but in a good way, not causing trouble or starting fights or any of that nonsense.  

Somewhere along the way fake pot came onto the scene.   I could have my cake and eat it to.   I could get high,  legally and not have to worry about drug tests.  Then it was banned. 

Somewhere along the road I came back to Kratom.  When I first used it it was hard to find.  A few heads hops carried it,  you had to seek it out, it wasn't all around.  Then it was everywhere, every head shop, every vape shop, and most gas station stores.  

With age the drinking basically went away on its own.  By my early 30's the hangovers were to rough and post drinking anxiety were to high.   So I dodged that bullet,  but got hit with another one.

My kratom use began to increase.   The once a week became both weekend days, which became both weekend days and a day in the week...we know where it leads.   

On the plus side I have always been a gym guy,  I've always worked out hard and had a pretty decent diet.  So to my peers I've always been the healthy guy,  while ironically I was always jumping from one addictive thing to the next.  

My entire life I have always sought out that cheat, that fix.  Trying get that feeling that addicts seek while not crossing the line.

I'm 5 days clean today and feel pretty good.  The first day was rough but its been a little better each day since.  Kratom has obliterated my sex drive and I guess I have to patiently wait for that to fix itself.  Ive wasted a lot of money on it over the years which has caused guilt and shame I suppose.   

I will not be doing it again.  I have taken breaks then though I could go back here and their, I can't.  That has always ended the same way.

So let's all do this thing we know needs to be done.  All the initial good that came from Kratom has long since passed.",10,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9897799491882324}"

Today is day 2 of my most recent taper drop. We considered dropping less since it's substantially a higher percentage of what I have been taking recently than it used to be when I was taking more, but in the end we decided to keep it at a .3 gram drop. 

So now I am taking .2 gram doses 6 times a day. Holy cow, that's 1/50th of what I used to take at my biggest dose! Other than the creeping panic attacks and anxiety, I can honestly say I don't at all feel worse than I did at my highest dose of kratom. Honestly I don't even know why I picked this drug up to begin with... although all things considered, I really think I am going to emerge from these withdrawals a stronger person.

But this Sunday is the big day, dropping to zero. I am scared, nervous, etc. But I have this sub to help me through. And I have to keep in mind, I am only taking 1.2 grams per day, and usually every week we drop 1.8 grams, so even though we are dropping a huge percentage, and dropping down to zero for the first time in over half a decade, it's still less of a drop than we usually do each week, so for my withdrawals, I'm thinking business as usual.

Kratom has been in my life for about 5 months. I originally wanted to use it to quit drinking - I started working from home around mid March of last year when I was still working for my old job. I have a history of substance abuse, but had been doing well since getting out of rehab in 2015. I maintained full sobriety for a few years, but then started drinking occassionally out with friends on weekends, and to be completely honest, I actually did that successfully for about 2 years.

Enter Covid - working from home with not much oversight I could get away with aaalllooooottt more, so I began getting a little tipsy towards the end of my work day. Then I started getting drunk. Then I started doing that EARLIER in the day. And earlier. You all see where this is going. I tried quitting a few times on my own, but only ever succeeded at white-knuckling for a few days. So I decided to try and replace it with.. something, didn't know what at the time. 

I was shopping for some vape stuff at a head shop and ran into Kraotm for the first time. Did a Google search, and that ended with me thinking ""Kratom is probably perfect"". So I bought some basic-ass green strain from the headshop, and the first time I took it, I was in love. Desire to drink? Gone. Irritability, stress, lack of attention... all gone. I was astounded and pretty much decided right then that Kratom was for me. 

I would say it only took me about 2 months until I got to the point where I was taking so much it was hard to keep track of anymore. My addict brain + my tendency to obsess over things + Kratom being legal and easily accessible = an insanely unhealthy relationship I cannot control. I've tried to quit 3 times now - each quit was for about 10-15 days. What REALLY sucks is when I come off of it, I get not only cravings for Kratom, but I'll also start craving drinking, or ANYTHING else. Taking Kratom kills these cravings, but the cost is basically trading addictions. On top of that, getting Kratom-ed out every day has made me and my emotions largely unpredictable, even to myself. I got a part time job at a grocery store after completely quitting my other job for unrelated reasons, but with using Kratom all the time, I've been calling off, cancelling plans with people, really just ignoring EVERYTHING that ISN'T Kratom. 

Sorry for the lengthy and / or rambly introduction, I'm just so tired of getting the wobbles, having to inconveniently gulp Kratom down ALL DAY, wasting money (when I decide to quit I like to make  a big deal out of it and throw my whole stash away, So I've ""re-bought"" my stash numerous times), and I'm especially tired of feeling guilty, knowing I'm using a substance that is causing me distress and ultimately my life would be better without it, but still choosing to use it day in and day out. I guess my intention with this post is to finally throw my line out there and see what help I can get - 'cause so far helping myself isn't enough.",10,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9981812238693237}"

Some of which I was completely naive thinking it was just some natural plant. The rest knowing I was addicted, and taking something multiple times a day, every day...natural or not can’t be a good thing. I did spend some time off of k. But it was replaced by a pharmaceutical version. For most of these years I was good, didn’t feel anything negative other than realizing I was definitely addicted. But I justified my addiction by thinking people get addicted to cigarettes and this is way better than that. Then the last year happened. Started getting extreme panic attack and eye wobbles. I even had a couple hour episode where I got stuck in the wobbles and could barely even stand. And my dumbass only lowered the dose. Like some of these internet k experts say..you took too much (was my same dose) or it was a bad batch (anything that has a bad batch can’t be good for you). I was good for another few months then it all started happening again. And that was it. I was done. Found this group and decided on CT. For me, the reason for CT was I wanted to be done NOW. 

The first week was physical hell. But not as bad as I thought it would be. Which was the reason I put the quit off for so long. 

 Emotions were all over the place. Then I had some pretty significant brain fog moments and anxiety attacks. But I had started to get these on k. So what’s really the difference really?

Second week was physically better. But still some fog and just feeling like I was in a video game and not real life as weird as it sounds. 

End of second week I had a day where I felt real down on myself like I did actual real damage. 

Third week was here to tell me I didn’t. Just about everything cleared up. 

Only lingering symptom is my stomach is still a bit off but it’s getting so much better. Start of week 5 and I would say my stomach is at about 75% 

YOU CAN DO THIS. 

I took one Monday off of work and that was it. It was hard but it is possible. I had Thursday night be my last normal dose. Then I had 1/4 my normal dose on Friday morning right as I got To work. So I was able to take on day 1-4 with no work since by the time I was feeling really shitty I was home from work then had all night Friday into Tuesday morning before I had to function. 

I started going to the gym around week 2 which also seems to be when things really started getting better. I’d suggest going earlier as I think it really helped. And as awful as it feels work out your legs harrrrd. I think that’s what really started helping out my sleep and aches in my legs. Instead I had a different ache which felt good because I felt like I was getting stronger. 

You will feel like shit. You will barely sleep the first week. You will feel cold and sweaty. You will think you fucked up your stomach permanently. ( you didn’t) you will think you fucked up your brain and emotional regulation (you didn’t). But slowly you will feel like yourself again. You will start having conversations in situations you would have avoided before. The sun will feel better. You’ll hear the birds again. Your face will lose bloat. You’ll shit out weird stuff. Then you won’t. You will become yourself again. 

Life on this side is so much better

All these years I thought I needed this shit to make life better. 

I didn’t. And you don’t either.

I’m 24 days off a three year 2 shot 7-8 gold cap a day OM Kratom run, which served its purpose three yrs ago to get me off street Ox’s (Fent.) but, in my infinite wisdom, I decided to stay on for the next three years. Who wants to sign up for Opiate withdrawal- even what I thought would be a very modified Kratom version- anymore than they have to?  I didn’t think it was meeting a mental or psychological need of mine- never felt any type of euphoria- or good at all, really. What I did feel was relief- relief from my screaming receptors, relief from the physical symptoms of true opiate w/d- where I knew I wouldn’t die, but I sure as hell wanted to at the time. I didn’t even think Kratom rated on the Richter scale of cravings- compared to the other substances and things I had craved, and had to have as though my life depended on it, throughout the years, but those currents in that river of denial can sure pull you under when you’re not looking. Sure, it was not as bad as some, worse than some, but whatever it was, it was there.
Anyway, 24 days ago, as all good addictions do- things ended in a shitshow- again. A modified shitshow, as this was Kratom and not Fent. Or coke, but a shitshow nonetheless. I decided to go to a Trauma camp- intensive Trauma informed therapy so I don’t keep making the same deleterious decisions repeatedly, and they needed me off mood altering substances. Rather whatever they deemed mood altering-. I can spend all day debating that one, especially the ones that have “mood-stabilizing” as the target effect, but are not considered mood-altering.  Not my circus, not my monkeys. 
By day 2 off K I was miserable- and not modified miserable- real Opiate miserable. They put me on a high dose Sub taper- too high dose- I don’t have that kind of tolerance anymore, and they weaned me down from 16 to 2 mg then off in a matter of 10 days. Besides being on the nod for the first three days bc of the too high dose, and the inital four days when I came off sub, it hasn’t been terrible, but it hasn’t been great either.  My mood is much improved, I still have negative motivation- I push myself to do things, and then get pissy that I don’t get a feeling of accomplishment , or even just a twinge of good. I know the reward pathways in my brain are fubar’ed at this point, courtesy of yours truly, and I know it’s going to take time. In true addict form, my instant gratification chip goes into meltdown when I can’t get what I want yesterday. I’ve gotta work on this whole patience is a virtue thing. The physical stuff comes and goes- on different days. One day it will be the creepies under the skin, the next the vice grips on the bones, the next the muscle jumping and spasms, the only two that are pretty consistent are freezing all the time ( which is the opposite of Fent WD where I used to sweat through everything several times a day), and the stomach sequela. At least they are not all together all the time!

I am going to try to get more physically and mentally occupied so I don't think about it. The anxiety in between shot times, chills, hard breathing, rls and falling asleep while basically standing up is horrible I swear to me it's worst than pain killers. I can't think properly or spell properly right now. I have noticed though that at times it feels easy to push through then one simple part of the wd process triggers every bone in my body. I am so proud of everyone on here that has succeeded I can't wait to be where yall are!! 💗 congrats guys",42,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9968386888504028}"

You're not gonna feel very good. But after that things get so much better. They say that in pleasure there is the seed of pain. Just as in yin, there is yang. So I think it's important to experience the pain that kratom  (or any drug) is capable of causing you. Going through this cold turkey really opened my eyes as to just how much this stuff was altering not just my body, but also my mind and spirit. It's a valuable experience that you shouldn't avoid just because of the discomfort. Running away from discomfort is probably the reason you were addicted to kratom in the first place. 
To give up any bad habit is a pretty miraculous thing if you think about it. I mean, nobody can really force you to. Nobody except yourself. It's something only you can do. And you know that it's going to suck. So I'd say it's an act of faith in a way. It's you dying to a way of being in faith of the new.",27,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9661728143692017}"

Another week completed, another blogpost. I want to say on the fourth or fifth day of browsing here someone was venting about their 28th day. All I can remember thinking at the time was how astounding it would feel to make it a month without kratom. I remember not being able to sleep, convinced my brain had been fried beyond repair. I’d pace endlessly around my house, staring out the window across the street, looking at a little blinking light on a sign. I remember it being 3am, my feet aching and my mind racing. I kept imagining I was the only person in the world who cared that light was blinking and that light knew I was the only one looking for it. And nearly every day since, before I sleep go and check on the little light. It’s still blinking, I’m still clean.

As far as this week goes? It was great. My anxiety didn’t crush my spirits for extended periods. Depression only came with nostalgia. I slept well all seven days. I even got to have a solid crap. Did I want to slam sludge? Yeah, I did. Pretty badly if I’m being honest. But I wanted to be clean 4 weeks more. And now? I have to try and make it to week 5.

Quitting kratom is your focus today.  Thats your goal and your accomplishment.  Eventually you won't need to solely focus on that, so you can add something else.  Then that becomes habit and you add something else.  

Kratom steals that progression so while it sucks taking a few months to focus on getting clean...its the only way life will be worth living.

2021-04-04 13:02:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/mk06gw/the_plan/,The plan,"At some point, all of us decide it’s time. Maybe more than once. So for me, it’s time to try life without my old friend. I know I’ll be more successful with a plan. 

The plan

Dosage: I’be been tapering, but falling off and can’t seem to get under 4t a day. I accept that there will be discomfort (Not my first time). I also know myself, if I hit the bottom, I’ll hit the fuck it switch. To keep myself off the bottom, I’m switching to capsules (I love the powder, as a ritual, a habit, a crutch and have found that the capsules don’t do it for me). Half gram dose 5 times a day at intervals to acclimate to the new normal of not being high.  Reduce the capsules daily for a week. And jump next Monday to nothing. No matter what. 

Prevention: hard exercise daily. I don’t particularly like exercise, I have always struggled with it. And always wished I could do it, could be healthy, could feel better in my own skin. Yesterday the reality of accomplishing that is totally possible, just.... start doing it. I’m going to be suffering anyway, might as well just lean in and embrace the pain as the journey. I’ve always wanted to buy a kettlebell. As a present to myself

Support: things have been really rocky with my boyfriend- because of kratom. Because of lifestyle differences. He is judgmental and does not understand addiction or the suffering of depression. He pulls away when he is concerned that I am not “good enough” to be around his daughter or be a good partner. I accept that we probably won’t work out, I accept that I am codependent and I accept that this is a cliff to jump off and grow into my own person. Just got my first own apartment, finally in a safe space to begin the difficult metamorphosis. Butterfly bitches!! I have requested that he exercise with me in the mornings, he teaches Kung fu. Just put me thru the paces. I will show up and work, but he does not have to be accountable for me. I am. No longer going to lean on him, another man, a substance, a pity story. Just me. I’m strong enough. Phone a friend when I lose sight or strength.

Mindset: discard guilt, shame and focus only on what is possible. 

Distraction: a long list of activities. When I enter the pit (I know it well) I will choose one and force myself to go thru the motions like a robot. I will not feel like it,‘I will only want to use and hide. But I have done that enough, I already tried that path. Doing something different now. Video games (not too much tv, all engaging things), walking, painting, sleeping, music, reading, teaching, sex, cleaning, organizing, tarot, plucking eyebrows, anything to get thru a ten minute timer. And then... get back to life, or, set it again and choose another. Over and over until my brain makes serotonin again.

Substitution: last time I did sobriety, I made my goal and it was painful and honestly not sustainable. I am prepared with harm reduction substitutes: cbd, thc, micro dose, a nice wine, (none in excess) just to take the edge off. I wish to be a person that enjoys a buzz on thr weekend as opposed to needing to stay there all day to deal. My life is much improved from when that cycle began. Xanax and Ativan in case of emergency. 

Supplements: organic plant based diet, meticulously planned. My favorite roasted veggies and tons of water. Fancy juice cleanse. Ridiculously overpriced dehydrated superfood capsules. Low fat carb cakes. Literally hitting this from every angle and doing everything possible to be better, to help. 

Finally: don’t take it so seriously. Life is ridiculous, might as well laugh at it. 

I’ll let you know what happens and how good I do, how close I come to these ideals. Knowing that it will not be perfect, but resigning myself to JUST KEEP GOING. 

Accountability: only my therapist and you guys, I’m too embarrassed to tell other people my plan because of failing or falling short. But I have me.",10,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9947918057441711}"

I have been a recovering alcoholic since 2004 and went cold turkey off methadone in AA in 2010. I started using Kratom off and on in 2018 when diagnosed with rectal cancer. Would use kratom when my pain meds would run out so I wouldn't withdrawal. This cycle continued thru my treatment at pain mgt. Last March the VA told pain mgt that all there veterans had to be taken off there pain medication or they wouldn't refer there patients to them anymore. BAMB! Boy did my kratom usage take off then. I'm pretty sure you all know where that has led me. I saw my primary care doctor last Thursday (non-VA) and cryed like a big baby. When I made the appointment she had never heard of Kratom but bless her heart she did her research. She was compassionate and caring. I have been referred to an addiction specialist. The only times I have gotten clean was through meetings, never treating the underlying causes of my addictions. I was terrified to come clean with my doctor and know my outcome is not the same for some people. It's hard for me to ask for help. Am I willing to go to any lengths? I think I am, I just can't do it alone. I don't know where this part of my journey will take me but I am hopeful.

I'm a doctor and I've been taking Kratom for two years at about 40gpd.  Within a few months of use I knew it was a problem. I used it to quit suboxone. Now it's been two years, my memory is falling apart, I'm numb, and my performance at work is bad. I have all of my knowlege still but I have no short term memory and very little ability to remember new information. I primarily do research so this is my entire job!  Anyway, I""m feeling a bit suicidal-- I don't think that's the right way to describe it, but it's like I'm just dead inside. I take my last dose at 6pm or 7pm and I wake up every morning at 4:30 to 5:30am sick as hell. I take 12 g and wait for it to kick in and 30 mins later for about one hour I feel good. Then the rest of the day is dowhill and chasing it with many many bouts of sickness. If I don't dose every 4 hours I break out in sweat. It's exausting hiding it, dosing in the bathroom. By the end of the day I just go to bed because I'm so sick and I need to sleep to let my opioid receptors reset.

I've tried tapering. I cannot do it. I fail every time.  I'm a person in recovery and I have 3.5 years without alcohol. With alcohol I needed to go into treatment and literally be ripped from it with 24 hour surveillance because my withdrawals were too bad/dangerous. I cannot do that now. I would lose my job for sure because I'm an opioid addiction researcher--- they cannot know that I'm addicted to opioids.

For me personally, all strains wake me up and are too stimulating for being used as a sleep aid. I usually have to wait for the kratom to wear off before I ever fall asleep, and sometimes I can't sleep when it does, my sleep is so messed up now from trying to figure it out. I usually have a last dose by 5pm. I even reduced the 5pm dose yesterday bc the night before I literally got 0 minutes asleep. I would do anything for sleep. But I wasn't getting sleepy but just wide awake. I kept trying to figure it out. Was it the black seed oil I just began trying?  Could it be this? Or that?

I had taken 2 amitriptyline tabs which is a double dose. It dries me out big time but it usually gets me to sleep. But I felt none of it. Kratom used to do that when I took any sleeping meds: stop them from working. I went thru bottles of benzos and things like hydroxyzine or whatever, all of them never felt bc the kratom was always stronger. Does anything overpower it?

I began getting bad anxiety thinking, oh shit, I can't stay awake lying here all night just like the night before. So I took 1 more tablet. Waited... So wide awake...

I just knew it was the kratom and I kept thinking how everyone says to take higher doses for a sedative effect. Or take a dark red strain or something. It never seemed true for me.

I'm working on a computer science degree and recently told myself that after these 2 math tests that were really important and I was struggling with that I would quit. They came and went, I tried to quit, but just couldn't get myself to do any of my work during that time and just felt hopeless, even with my Adderall prescription.

I really figured I never needed to taper since I was already at such a low dose, but I just can't seem to handle cold turkey (the fact that I'm prescribed Adderall and take it daily could contribute to anxiety I get from the kratom withdrawal).

I´m 32 years old, I´m from Germany and I startet using opioides when I was about 16 years old. Most of the time I used nothing but kratom. It always startet with a low dose but always endet up at 30-40 GPD pretty quickly. I lost count of how many times I went to hospitals for detoxes and after my last detox in a hospital about 2 1/2 years ago PAWS hit me hard enough to make me relapse after about 3 months. After that I gave up. I was prescribed 20 mg of subutex a day for about 18 Months. The sideeffects, especially the depression and the cravings for other drugs, have been so bad that I decided to swich back to kratom. I was able to swich from that dose to about 40 g kratom per day without any withdrawals. 

About 3 months ago I couldn´t stand the depression and the anxiety I got from kratom anymore. For me going to a hospital never really got me clean. I was always prescribed other toxic chemicals which I would find myselfe being dependend on in some way so I prayed and still pray every day that I would be able to stick to a taper. I startet at about 40 GPD on 27.12.2020. Today is day 8 on 3 GPD and I got hope again that I will be free of this plant which completely controlled my life, made me irritable, selfish and dishonest to my girlfriend and my family. Even though I tapered very slowly I still suffered and experienced almost every withdrawal symptom that I know from kratom and other opioides. But I got to a point where I feel more relaxed, more confident and much better in general. It really starts feeling like it´s gonna be worth it.

I want to thank you all for sharing your success stories and I hope that I will be able to share my success story in some weeks and months as well so I can give other users the hope that you gave me when I hadn´t any hope anymore.

I was always referred to as the good kid and a smart person (I’ve made some good accomplishments for being 21 years old but when it comes to drugs I’m a fucking dumbass). I never so much as smoked weed, drank a sip of alcohol, or went to a party in high school and even throughout my first year of college. During my second year of college I got insanely depressed and found all the people praising Kratom on Reddit for “curing” their depression all while having no downsides. Sounded perfect for the situation I was in and I was desperate so I ordered some and was basically hooked instantly. I will admit it did suppress my depression, but later on I would realize that it was from numbing all my emotions. Still, I will say that it might have very well saved my life that semester, I’ve never thought about suicide until that semester but when I drank Kratom the thoughts faded and my mind went blank.

I transferred schools next semester but I couldn’t stop taking Kratom and about halfway through the semester I realized I had a problem (taking like 20g-30g doses at every opportunity I could). I tried quitting but some big life events happened all at once (a bad breakup after telling my ex I had a problem and I need to quit, covid hitting my city which gave me major anxiety and ocd, and something else I honestly can’t remember). I made it 5 days but after the breakup I immediately went into a complete nosedive. I had a few months that spring where I was abusing the absolute fuck out of serotonin stims (had binges of 3g of MDMA over the course of 5 days, 4g of 4-FA in 5 days, 14g of Mephedrone in a couple weeks, 2g of 5-MAPB over the course of a couple weeks where I took it like every other day). Unfortunately that was just the start (I was still taking tons of kratom every day at this point, I relapsed like 30 minutes after my breakup).

That summer (which was last summer during the lockdown) I had a huge opportunity as I was interning at Amazon as a software development engineer. The pressure and stress I had was immense and I ordered like 4kg of Kratom, but good news I didn’t take any.... because I started using Oxycodone. And then benzos. And then meth. To be specific I spent the entire summer using like 4-5 Oxy 80s a day (120mg 3x a day), 150mg of meth (I got everything from dark net markets and this was like $90/g Dextro-Meth so it was super high quality), and like 40mg Etizolam or 20mg Xanax at night. This was my daily routine for months. I’m still dealing with the aftermath of this. Meth was easy for me to quit, I really didn’t even notice it except being tired for a couple days maybe, Meth was never addictive to me but I used it as a crutch for work and to counteract the sedation of the high opiate doses. I got payed like $10k a month at Amazon, unfortunately I wasted like $20k that summer on drugs, even at the super cheap prices I got the oxy for (mexican pharma Sanzoz 80s for $40 a piece) it still added up to insane amounts. Luckily I got off easy with not finding meth addictive, however opioids and benzos had a grip on my soul.

At the end of the summer I switched from the short-acting benzos to Valium to start a taper. I started around last August taking 200mg of Valium a night and am currently around just 10mg at night so I’ve made good progress on the benzos. As for the Oxy, luckily I had a spare 4kg of kratom laying around which let me transition without much trouble, but unfortunately I had 4kg of Kratom laying around... I blew through that in just a few months. I tried quitting a couple more times since then but always ended up ordering more. I’m 2 or 3 days without it now and was about to order more, but I’m just so tired of this shit honestly. Getting high is exhausting. I don’t even like kratom, I can’t feel it even at 30g doses I’ve just been taking it for maintenance.

I think it’s finally time for me to come down. I’ve been high for 2 years straight. I don’t remember what it feels like to be sober. I don’t do any of my hobbies that I used to love. I’m so lazy and complacent, which is not how I used to be at all. I used to have big dreams and work hard every day to make them become a reality but I stopped caring over a year ago. I’ve tried quitting like 4 times before but this time is different. My mindset is different, I’m just sick of drugs honestly. Having to plan your whole day around taking these drugs is no way to live life. I found a therapist (no psychiatrists will see me since I still have a benzo dependency, I definitely have underlying mental health issues though) who I’m seeing this week who specializes in addiction and depression and anxiety, so with that and my benzo taper being close to finished and running out of my batch of kratom I’m taking that as a sign. I’m ready to get all this shit out of my body and give my brain a break.

Sorry for the rant, I don’t have much of a support group. My mom knows about the benzos and opiates but not the stims, although losing 40lbs over the summer and becoming extremely underweight probably threw some red flags. I’ve got a friend to talk to but they also use kratom and benzos so I’ve basically had to quit everything by myself with no help and I feel confident this is the beginning of the end so I thought I’d share my story for the first time with somebody.",21,"{'covid': 1, 'lockdown': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9982359409332275}"

I think K did a lot to destroy any reasonable expectations I had for day to day life and so now it’s more about realizing I’m not necessarily depressed, I’m just bored for the moment or perhaps processing an emotion that before would have been masked by K.   Realizing it’s ok to go to bed at a decent hour and only get 10 tasks done today instead of 20 etc etc. Really just a lot of introspection, patience and self care. Basically just getting back to normal life. A few highs, a few lows and a lot of in between and that’s perfectly ok with me.

I'm now 36 days clean from K and going through the withdrawal process and experiencing how the mind twists and squirms in response to having its desires withheld, I've come to the realization that I'm still facing an addiction that is much bigger and harder to take care off. I'm addicted to Youtube / the internet.

Now this might seem silly to some of you, but looking back at my relationship with K, I can say that there are plenty of similarities in regards to how it makes me feel to just shut my brain off and binge hours of pointless video after pointless video and how it leaves me feeling empty and grimy when my desire is depleted.

Today I decided to block my access to YT and stop my consumption of it for an indefinite amount of time and I quickly felt what could be described as withdrawal symptoms and cravings. I didn't know what to do with myself, so I ended up just walking in circles in my living room. 

I had labeled my relationship to YT addictive in the past, but I never really felt as convinced about that as I do now, having experienced the K withdrawals and being able to look back at my behaviour with clearer eyes.

Dealing with this addiction will be much harder in comparison to what I went through with K since the internet is such an integral part of modern life and how normalized it is to spend ungodly amounts of time on social media etc., but I think it just numbs me to a stunning degree and I need to bring some distance between me and YT.

So yeah, I just wanted to share where I'm standing currently in my ongoing journey to leave Kratom behind me and maybe some of you are in similar situations in that you have uncovered other addiction problems in your own withdrawal process. I'd like to hear about that! :)

Like the ocean, the mind has waves that rise and fall. With drugs, there's a come up and a come down. When I drink alcohol, I start to think everything is okay and then after a little bit everything starts to concern me. When I smoke weed, everything falls beautifully into place, and then after a while my thoughts become scattered like leaves blowing in the wind. And when I take kratom... 

As context, I relapsed today. After two weeks off kratom and one week off hydrocodone, I caved. I bought $30 worth of kratom (what a waste), and drank 9 grams. As it started to wear off, I experienced this lingering sense of deep, numb sadness. Numb because it felt like whatever was making me sad was ""too late."" Like the late stages of grief. It reminded me of how I felt when I was grieving a loved one I lost in high school. A year and a half after that loss, there was this late night where I realized that this person was still gone, and they were fading in my memory... that's how gone they were. I cried a lot that night. The come down from kratom reminded me a little bit of that... except I couldn't cry.

The worst part is, I think when you refuse to accept the trough of the wave and you keep taking kratom over and over again, it's like there's this tectonic shift deep inside and it causes a tidal wave. That tidal wave just keeps coming and coming, until all of your life is covered in that numbness, all day.

I don't have to live like that. I never had to live like that. So I'm swimming back to the surface. I gave my kratom to a friend who put it in his cabinet, and we went for a long walk and talked. I guarantee you he won't be giving me that kratom back anytime soon. Which is fine with me. I'd been wondering if I was really ready to quit, and now I know.

Last night I took valerian root, CBD, sleep aid formula and magnesium and l theanine and still toss and turned for the first half of the night. The sleep aid formula stuff I take has chamomile, gaba, Passion flower, lemon balm, hops extract and melatonin. I feel like I read somewhere that there was a supplement that can actually aggravate RLS but I can’t remember which one it was, maybe it’s one of those. 

I’ve kind of faltered at 5.6 gpd even though I was supposed to drop 2g a couple days ago. I’m going to drop to 3.75 tomorrow. 

This subreddit is a total blessing and a curse. It has helped me a lot but sometimes I read things that really send me into a panic. Like last night I read someone that said that kratom withdrawal totally broke them, and they felt totally insane for a time. Or the people still experiencing tons of depression months down the road. Obviously I think people should be able to voice what they’re going through! But it affects me reading this stuff a bit. I already feel like I’ve been trudging through this journey for so long and honestly I’m okay but I haven’t felt totally grounded either. When I’m around other people, I’m totally fine. But as soon as I have a few moments alone I get totally in my head about it.

The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.","My initial drop hurt for a long time.  I only went from 30 to 20 but adjusting took weeks.  Despite the self-hate, regrets and fear, I slowly took off .25g every day.  Finally when I dipped under 12g yesterday things got a little easier.

I dose six times throughout the day, evenly spaced out and bring some to bed.  I used to take 2g to bed for overnight but now I'm down to 1g.  Keep in mind I take one of the six doses only an hour or two before bed so the extra gram is for waking in the middle of the night.

I take Agmatine, Black Seed Oil, NAC 1000 and Vitamin C powder, straight Ascorbic Acid powder daily.  All help the withdrawals.  When thing get tough I will take as much as 4000 mg of Vit C powder, 2 tsp.  It helps a lot.

My looks are shot.  I mean I have aged 10 years in one year.  Everyone says I'm way too skinny.  It's really my caved-in face.  I'm skeletal.  I'm scary looking.  Black circles under the eyes and an overall weakness.

This group is my only friend, I've lost my social circle.  The kratom addiction brings all past failures up close and personal.  I mean when you are going down the kratom rabbit hole of failure and you're sick with withdrawal, nothing gives you much hope.

My message to myself and others is don't blame everything on the kratom.

It has a lot to do with your lifelong patterns, the one's that brought you to kratom.  I like to escape.  I like to feel good.  I like to avoid hard work whenever possible.  I think the easy way is always the right choice.  I work really hard at something, achieve praise from others, and then call it a day and celebrate when that's when the real work should begin.

I'm a lazy person.  I don't like to do uncomfortable things.  I'm an idealist and will walk away from really good things because there's something I don't like.  I never really finish anything.  I jump around from one thing to another.

I have some really destructive patterns.  And when kratom came knocking I said where have you been all my life.  There could be no trouble.

But like you and everyone here I soon discovered there was lots of trouble.  The easy way out is the hardest in the long run.  So now I'm gonna taper all the way down, .25g a day.  And when I'm done and off kratom--

That's when the real work begins.

Quitting this devil is step one.  Then the real work begins.  Putting my life back together.  Addressing and breaking my long established patterns that led me to this nasty plant in the first place.

I never thought I'd become addicted to an opioid. 
I always thought that I'll never take a hard drug instead I stocked to weed and experimented with weak, not very potent herbs.

Well too bad I thought Kratom was harmless too!


The funny thing is I knew it was very addictive and always took it for 1 week straight and then pause for 4 weeks. But then I made the stupid mistake to order once more. 
I knew it was already hard to quit after 1 week of everyday consumption.
So I was always too afraid to try out an withdrawal. Then I got sick a few times and took more kratom than ever before against the symptoms. 

End of story 3 years later I'm still addicted to 25gpd. 

I want to quit and today I only took 12g with an 8 hour pause after my first dose. I will make it and when I made it I can say I know how a real hard drug addiction feels like. 
And I will be stronger than before since I know I'm stronger than my emotions. Even if I didn't wanted it I became addicted to opioids and I will quit them.

If I taper, I'm thinking about starting at 15 grams and then dropping a half gram per day. Would that be a good rate to make the physical and emotional withdrawal more bareable without drawing it out for an excessive period of time?

Sleep has been pretty good with the help of clonidine. Every time I take the LDN I get a horrible sleep and the next day I feel like crap. I’m going to maby play around a little more with it but idk if it’s working that great. Last night I took 0.25 and today Ive had goosebumps all day. I am cold all the time. I was having a horrible taste and smell the first week which sometimes comes back but for the most part is gone. I’m a welder and all the smells of burning metal is driving me nuts but tomorrow I start landscaping so I will be able to get some exercise and fresh air.

I do have a heroin addiction that I’ve been clean from over 7 years. 
I’m so tired of having to drink green sludge the minute I wake up to the minute I go to bed. I’ve been lurking on here to see others progress/how they do it. 
I am starting ketamine infusions for treatment resistant depression & would like to get off before I start. 
I HATE these opioid like withdrawals it’s triggering and brings me back to that dark place I was years ago. 
Thought/suggestions/ advice and words of encouragement is greatly appreciated

Day one - miserable I already had a sinus infection going into this, but in some drastic hair-brain idea to rejuvenate some follicles, I carried on with the gut wrenching dread of saying so long to this slimy substance. 

Day two - Already having dealt with adhd for 28 years, I’ve now come to terms that the only thing this substance fixed was my PTSD, which I would consider 50% gone from the 2 year binge, what anxiety remains is my own to suffer through for the next week, with this knowledge I was able to stay true to myself.

Day three - I truly have bad memory.  But at least I have more now that I’m off this substance. 


Day four - My penis gets in the way of everything as if I was 12.  I thought I was done having sex. My girlfriend took this problem pretty hard.

Day 5 - finally realized the only way to deal with the anxiety, which was stemming from my natural adhd, was to lift weights again.   This is a problem for now I am in great spirits and people think I’m on drugs.

Day 6 and beyond- Godzilla vs. Kong is a great movie.

I will come back in a couple months and let you all know about the before and after pics of my hair.

That makes today day 11.  I had just had enough of being tethered to dosing just to feel normal. It saw me through joint tears, nerve pain, and healing from sutures.  I chose K over prescribed narcotics every time they were prescribed.  But then, I would wake up from WD symptoms and that was the last straw for me.  I quit while still working and taking care of my kids simultaneously - no one knew a thing, but it is an internal hell.

While most of the most unpleasant symptoms are gone, some still remain and I would like to know if they’re normal.  I take 300 mg Gabapentin and magnesium to be able to get to sleep.  I also take a 1/1 THC/CBD tincture, Kava Kava, and Motrin as needed.  

I still wake up at 3am with night sweats almost 2 weeks later and I’m sleeping on towels.  My body feels heavy and moving takes more effort.  Joints hurt.  MAJOR congestion and sneezing still persist.  Is that normal?  Restless leg went away early on which was a big worry.  Cravings took about 5-6 days but that doesn’t mean I don’t wish I could take some all the time.  I wonder if that will ever go away.  I talked to my doctor about my sleep issues and she prescribed ambien and Wellbutrin.  I haven’t taken either med because I ordered Nuphorin on Amazon and want to try it first.

I think the fact that I still have a ton of product and not touching it is a huge improvement on my life.  Now I can travel and be free from the shackles of K.",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9974682331085205}"

So I’ve been thinking about getting off of Kratom again but know that it won’t be as easy to quit as last time. First time I quit we were on lockdown during Covid in April last year so I was able to sit at home and deal with the WD’s. Went exactly 4 months before I got back on it in August and been on it since. Why I did, I have no idea. I came such a long way only to mess my system all up again.
This time around, I’ve been afraid of quitting even after tapering because I just opened my own business and can’t miss work. I was going to wait til a few months from now, until a friend of mine recently just gave me 14 600 mg Gabapentins. My question is basically, should I taper down and take these while I do it, or is it better to save them during my WDs? And would these be enough to last? I read somewhere most take around 900 mg a day for WDs. 
I wish I had the willpower to be able to get off of these and just go to work, but I know my anxiety would be through the roof and I just opened a body contouring spa which is supposed to be chill and relaxing. Last thing you want to do or can do when you’re dealing with these pills. Just want to go back to my old life where I’m not relying on these anymore. Kratom really isn’t even worth it.

I feel like if I can just rid myself of this habit no one needs to know if ever happened, but I'm also just feeling so guilty about it. 

I've never seen a counselor but am considering it. Nervous because even at the dr's office I've never revealed my use. What are your experiences? Does seeing someone and talking about it help? Did it help you stay clean? These mental WD games are brutal.",6,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9851107597351074}"

Hi Friends - As the title says Day 6 of CT attempt gazillion. I won't get into my whole story here but it's the same as so many others. In the past, never made it past day 16 except once with the help of naltrexone (prescribed by my Dr.). This time, I'd been planning on starting it tomorrow (1 week mark). 2 days ago I found a tramadol script in a drawer I had totally forgotten about and never even thought about taking, didn't even know it was an opiate until I looked it up that day. It was a pretty shitty day (day 4 CT sucks as you know) so I was an idiot and tried 200mg, then another 50 and didn't feel a thing. Maybe it relieved my wd's a little? But maybe just a placebo, my tolerance is pretty high (was doing 50+g/day). Since it didn't do shit I'm not tempted to take anymore (and I know all the risks of taking too much, seizures, etc), and I've never touched any other pills or hard drugs expect when prescribed/needed for pain in the past....

But anyways, does anyone have exp with it (Tramadol) and Naltrexone? Should I expect any precipitated withdrawal from it if I took on schedule tomorrow? Should I put the naltrexone off a few more days to make sure it's out of my system?",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9988569021224976}"

Finally discovered the issue while perusing this board. Last night took a heaping teaspoon of Calm in some water, 10mg melatonin, and a sleepy time tea. This was the first sleep I’ve gotten after two terrible nights with RLS, anxiety out the roof, and cold sweats. Was it the best night sleep? Hell no, but I slept. I’m used to taking Unisom and that is big NO right now. I also have horrible congestion, runny nose, etc so was taking any antihistamines I could get my hands on. How dumb! This morning I took DayQuil, which I think is ok. Have a terrible headache but going to play it by ear today. Check your labels on what you’re taking to help with the WD symptoms and look those things up on this board. So much knowledge from others who’ve been down this road.

What was different about kratom was with drugs like cocaine I couldn’t make art or go to work, but with kratom I could. But it was a lie, still made art but I got fired from 2 jobs because I was always tired and wanted to be lazy. 

I’m on day 6 of quitting, the physical symptoms are gone but now it’s just this depressive anguish. I thankfully have rent covered for the next two months but I’m unemployed and can’t even find the motivation to get up and go do doordash to make some spending money 

You guys were right, when the lows hit really hard all I want is to go buy some more but I’ve chosen to suffer through it. On a more positive note, I feel so much more alive. I can feel again and feel more present.

I'm ready I guess. Financially I can't handle doing this anymore. I'm spending about $80 a week and it's killing me. Already I'm starting to get cold sweats, but I'm not turning back!!! I have hopes to get a few weak codeine pills to hide my K withdrawals. I know it's not the smartest idea, but I've never had trouble shaking codeine. Out of my 3 month stint, I took 5 days off from K because I had the same codeine pills that I'm hoping to get again. During that 5 days, on like day 3 I could feel rushes of energy which i think was the K leaving my body, so I guess that's my game plan this time. Only I'm NOT going back to K once the codeine is gone!!!! Wish me luck!!",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9971730709075928}"

Overall the day was fine and normal, a lot of mental head games for sure. Thoughts of doubt, uncertainty, fear of the unknown, etc.. The change from plain leaf to a weaker stem and vein was noticeable but not unmanageable. I was able to accomplish all of my daily task w/ no issues, even got my tax return done finally, lol. 

Today: dropping to 4.5 tsp. I'm going to make a drop already because of how well yesterday went and felt. Ill continue to monitor my daily feels and evaluate the day before first thing in the morning for these first few drops. I am aware the less it becomes the more difficult it will get also so ill definitly slow the drops down up ahead but for now I think I am OK to drop on day 2.

I really appreciate all of the outreach on yesterday's post, the words of encouragement, support and advice. Its honestly the motivating factor to staying the track. Each new notification I get breaths new life into the decision to get off this shit. Thank you all.

I was a sweating mess at work, listening to this mental duel in my head between my desire to stay sober and my desire to forget it all and slump out on the couch.  Fuck, I had actually decided after work that I was going to go pick up.  

But I didn't.  I called my girlfriend and basically screamed about how badly I wanted to just get high.  How unfair it felt that other people got to take the edge off, that I had kratom to wean me off the physical aspects of alcoholism and how it had stabbed me in the back and how badly I still wanted it.  I put on the loudest, angriest music I could think of.  I listened to Leaning With Intent to Fall by Dystopia and thought of all my friends with dope problems I don't see anymore.  I thought of all the days I spent sludged out in bed, convincing myself I was reaching spiritual enlightenment.  I cried and punched a wall.  

But I didn't use.  Every time you research kratom you just hear how much of a wonder drug it is.  Even fuckin podcasts advertise it now, which triggers my ass constantly.  I decided before I went and bought some of the green that I needed to come here.  I read posts on this sub and felt community and love and understanding.  I felt seen and validated in my struggle.  I saw others striving for a better life.  

I love you and am in debt to you all.  Yesterday I didn't relapse.  Today I'm six months free of opioids.

So yesterday, I dropped my car off at the shop and was carless (not a convenient thing where I live) and stuck at home working all day. I popped 4.8 g capsules around 7 am and took a gabapentin. Around 11 am I had a fantastic 5 mile run, around 7:45 min/miles. Around 1 pm, I walked to the headstore and bought a shot (addict behavior Ik...super stressed about $1700 worth of car repairs but that’s also part of the motivation behind my quit). I didn’t feel any signs of w/d...I did the shot more for my anxiety than any physical complulsion. Then at night I did 4.8 g capsules again. So assuming the shots I do are between 9 and 14g (I have read various reports here), the max I did was under 25g! I took another gaba around bedtime and couldn’t sleep and am up working now, but I don’t feel any w/ds at all! 

I’m kinda shocked that I could drop from ~50gpd to <25g with only 2 gabapentins and feel alright. I should add that usually I feel nothing with the capsules (green maeng da). Do yall think the gabapentin is the reason I was able to reduce my dosage so easily? Today I’m going to try and drop to <20g and see how that goes. Today my new insurance kicks in and I get to see my pcp so I am really hopeful!

Have wondered this for a while and let me preface by saying this NOT a recommendation for ANYONE to try this. Quit responsibly in the right way. This is all hypothetical.

But, would using those drugs as a distraction to fight initial challenges of CT help at all to avoid withdrawal? I'm talking using it in a way that wouldn't lead to just a replacement addiction.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9981784820556641}"

I've been forcing myself back to the gym and so far after a week back I already feel the exercise is really helping the recovery process. I started tapering down from 15gpd back in February and it was a long arduous process, but im happy I stuck with it. It eventually got to the point where the kratom was just causing more anxiety and depression even when on it. But the withdrawals were even worse, so I felt stuck between a rock and a hard place. Addiction plays games with your mind. I stayed in that loop for far too long. The anxiety and depression days come and go, I just have to keep reminding myself that things are getting better day by day. 


It feels great not waking up in withdrawal and having to drag myself out of bed to drink sludge. Time to take back control of my life again. I pretty much have a clean slate right now. I also just got out of an extremrly unhealthy 2 year relationship so who knows what will come next, but first lots of healing needs to happen. I'm determined to get to the roots of my addiction patterns in general and feel I get wiser with each relapse. It's part of the process after all. The voice of addiction gets less charge day by day. Ive been here before. I try to see the addiction voice in my head as a sleazy salesman who doesn't have my best interests at heart. It helps me to kind of separate myself from it.
