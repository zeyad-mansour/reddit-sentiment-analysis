I don‚Äôt know what the problem was, being that I was tremendously successful in the past until I relapsed. The cravings seemed stronger, the migraine seemed worse, and the ever present feeling of doom felt utterly dominant. I made it two days, used for two, and then made it to day three on the second quit attempt of the week, and it was absolutely nuts how bad I felt, and I caved again.

The difference was, this time it wasn‚Äôt immediate relief and ‚ÄúI know this will suck later, but for now it‚Äôs okay‚Äù. I felt crushed, dull, insanely depressed. I whimpered in the shower, I felt doom, while under the influence of k.

I broke down to my friend. She helped me tremendously quit the first time, and I feel that this time was exceedingly difficult because I had only me to rely on. I thought I could handle it, I couldn‚Äôt. I am lucky and eternally grateful that she was so understanding and motivating, even though she herself has never been here. 

I came up with a new formulated plan. I‚Äôm gonna do a very aggressive taper, which will mean just one dose a day (right before bedtime) to sleep. The absolute worst symptom for me these last quits was the insomnia. Never ending nights.

I can make it through the shitty days, though they will suck, because people keep me going and I am lucky to have a 12 hour job throughout the week on an alternating schedule. On days off, I will make it a point to exercise as much as possible, and just get to bedtime. 

I‚Äôll start at a 6.6 gram dose, and drop a capsule every 3-5 days, with the help of black seed oil and a few other supplements. I plan to keep this tapering schedule up until May 3, where I go on a work exercise for two weeks. When I go there, I will jump. It might suck (albeit hopefully not as bad due to the taper), but I figure there will be no way for me to purchase any while up there, and I‚Äôll have some of my best friends up there with me to keep me going. That‚Äôs the plan. 

What do you guys think? Let me know if you think this is too aggressive, reckless, or what.

Kratom changes the way you look. After being off 20 days I've just now realized this. I literally looked in the mirror and had to take a second glance. I'm not an attractive man by any means, but holy crap this kratom has taken me to the dumps! My hair isn't growing back yet, but it's changing texture. It's softer. My skin is less oily, acne filled, shiny, dry, greasy. The dark spots on my face are slowly starting to fade. My face is less puffy/swollen (possibly from hypothyroid) There are less cracks in my skin. Even my eyes have changed. I didn't realize how dead they looked taking so much kratom. They where so grey dry and lifeless. Now they have a shine to them. When I read posts about people saying they didn't recognize themselves in the mirror I thought they where just exaggerating. I think it's because kratom changes the way you look soooo slowly you just think your aging normally or something. I started taking it at 16 years old, used for about 4 years, and probably aged 10. I swear I went from a baby face 16 year old to a walking dead zombie in 4 years! Just 20 days off and can already see myself coming back.

I'm 22F I dropped out of college because of my depression and anxiety (maybe I could do it now that I'm on k HAHA). A year ago I started k. Before that I was always looking for stuff to get high off of. My whole family is full of addicts. I give myself credit. I've never taken anything as hard as them (or have I?

Whether you're tapering, or in the thick of acute withdrawals, or experiencing PAWS or even struggling to quit and stay quit, I just want to let you know that **it is possible to quit kratom and to stay quit**. Try, with all your might, to **stay positive**. Try, with every fiber of your being, to **stay as busy / active as positive**. Where the body goes, the mind will follow. Try, even though you may feel like you have nothing to offer and can barely help yourself, to **help someone else today**. Simply holding a door open for someone or telling a loved-one that you love them could make a world of difference in their day and yours. And finally, try to **believe that you WILL get through this** without using again. I believe in you and so do many, many others on this subreddit. And if you slip and fall, as Greg Doucette says, ""**Try harder than last time!**"" You'll be amazed how strong you are... how strong WE are.

""Nature abhors a vacuum"", a very relatable quote for addicts. It's what I have to tell myself when I quit a substance. Your body will seek equilibrium, don't try to cheat misery. Little distractions here and there can be necessary, we've all got a breaking point. Sitting on the other side of this detox, my real demons are making themselves known again, as they are wont to do. 

Kratom kept me embarrassingly complacent. I was playing this old MMO I rediscovered like it was my job. This is only a minor exaggeration. Now I can't play it for more than about 5 minutes without going, ""meh"". Lots of time has freed up and idle hands will betray me. I had a few drinks last night. Nothing crazy, just a few of those miniature shots you can buy at the liquor store. Problem being, it was a wonderful night! New episode of my favorite podcast came out, laughed so hard I thought I was going to pass out, made myself a great dinner, not a single negative emotion the whole time, slept better than usual. 

There's that positive reinforcement. Alcohol has never been my drug of choice, but I've had issues with it in the past. My last go-around with booze was in fact precipitated by self-medicating kratom w/d. Now, what lead to me drinking last night? I'm 90% better compared to day 1 CT. This isn't even about detox, I'm just fucking bored. I gave my father access to my bank account so he can see what I'm purchasing. If I pull out cash from an ATM I have to show him receipts of what I bought. A useful suggestion for some of you that want to be kept honest. Eh, any minute now I'm going to get an upset text or a phone call. Sort of forgot I'd given him that info, that's why I felt comfortable doing what I did. Alcohol wasn't on my mind for tonight, but now it definitely isn't. 

I can only occupy myself with so many errands, my sober friends are all just acquaintances, my close friends are all still in active addiction.  I'm very happy that the physical withdrawals have subsided, but my big mistake has always been thinking that was the hard part. Today I'm going to buy some new running shoes and see how out of shape I am. I'm getting my vaccine at some point soon, maybe I can take a fucking class or volunteer or something.

So I am making this post in hopes may help those who may still be struggling to get off this sh*t.  I was an extremely heavy kratom user, got up to 100GPD for almost 3 years.  

I was terrified to go through the withdrawals without help and I am happy I did.  The first 1-5 days were hell but by day 6 I felt better.  Still freezing and hot all the time but I do feel better emotionally and psychologically.  The anxiety is still there but that's the whole reason why I used it. 

I will be completely honest the medical help I got was a lifesaver.  I was prescribed clonidine and gabapentin without these 2 medications I wouldn't have been able to get through.
The clonidine helped with both the hot flashes and cold sweats like crazy to the point of almost not even feeling them.  The withdrawal was bearable and I actually slept through the night 3 which felt awesome.  

I am still going through some PAWS.  All the emotions that I was suppressing with the Kratom has come back 1000x.  My anxiety is through the roof but I am finding exercising has helped tremendously.

Just wanted to share something that has been helping me out a lot with PAWS. I just recently got through the acutes but still have been feeling brain fog, fatigue, and some depression. Decided to get some Shilajit. In the past this has been one of the most impact full supplements I‚Äôve taken. Since taking it all my symptoms have vastly improved.

I think one of the main reasons is opiates suppress the HPA axis which results in fatigue. Shilajit does an amazing job at restoring the HPA axis. Also Shilajit has 80 trace minerals and as most of you know kratom depletes you‚Äôre body of minerals and nutrients. Along with trace minerals it contains fulvic acid and amino acids. All in all it will help your body rebalance and heal! I don‚Äôt know for certain but I‚Äôd imagine Kratom reduces testosterone based on the lack of sex drive. Shilajit does an amazing job at boosting testosterone. 

One thing to note is quality matters! If you are gonna get some don‚Äôt skimp on the quality. You want Shilajit that is legit and properly filtered and extracted. I‚Äôm not sure if I can share brands on here or not but PM me and I‚Äôll let you know what i use or if someone confirms I can I‚Äôll add the brand I use.

It's from an old Andrew Lloyd Webber musical called ""Starlight Express."" I've never actually seen it, but I guess it's about a toy train set that comes to life? But anyway, I enjoyed listening to this today as I'm dealing with withdrawals. I was playing it on a loop in the car when I had to do a quick errand this morning. I actually started crying at one point during this line:

*""The inside might be as black as the night, but at the end of the tunnel, there's a light.""*",6,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.984154224395752}"
2021-03-30 08:44:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/mgf685/vertigopsychosis/,VERTIGO/PSYCHOSIS,"I used for about 3-4 years. At my worst I was using 80+gpd for probably almost a year. I'm just curious if any VERY heavy users have experienced these bizarre side effects from kratom. So one of craziest side effects I got was what I could only call psychosis. It always happened right before falling asleep. Like as I closed my eyes to go to sleep my imagination would just instantly take over. And not in a good way. For example if I imagined standing over a cliff, I would literally FEEL like I was standing over a cliff. It was like my thoughts almost became reality. I would imagine being at work, and would almost completely forget I was just lying in bed. I would have to open my eyes to bring me back to reality. It must've been either hallucinations or straight up psychosis. But either way it was extremely unpleasant.

I would also get another weird phenomena that I think was vertigo. It would also only happen when closing my eyes. Basically when everyone closes their eyes their looking at the inside of their eyelids. It's not scary experience it's just normal. But When I closed my eyes it wasn't like I was looking at the back of my eyelids. It either felt like I was looking through infinite space, or it felt like I was looking at something super super close to me ""my eyelids"" both equally uncomfortable. I don't know why but my brain would just completely obsess over the distance at which I was seeing. My vision would do this weird dance, like it was zooming in and out really really fast. It wasn't eye wobbles or anything like that, because I've gotten that too, it was something different. It was that feeling you get when looking over a ledge from really high, only I would imagine it's the feeling you get from actually jumping. I was honestly scared to go to sleep for a while. 

It's really impossible to describe how it felt. It was honestly psychedelic. Like using kratom as much as I have has taken me to some WEIRD places in my mind. Almost otherworldly. Disconnected. I really feel alone in these types of experiences. Most people talk about hellish withdrawals. I can relate to that. But some of the most worrisome effects for me, are on the mind. I feel like I've visited some of the darkest depths of my psyche. Especially that lasts month of use, and the first week of withdrawal. And It's 100% from the kratom because I'm 19 days CT and finally some of this mental weirdness is fading.

Anyways I'm just curious if anyone else experienced any bizarre side effects like these. I think it would be pretty helpful to learn about some of the rare possible side effects this plant can cause. I know it helps when someone shares the same experience, so I'm hoping someone who's experiencing anything like this will find comfort knowing their not the only one. I plan on making a complete list off all the weird symptoms that I know are from the kratom in a few months when I completely get over the withdrawals. And good luck to anyone who's trying to quit, you can add this to another reason to stay off this plant.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.993604838848114}"

Among other things, Kratom has allowed me to tolerate things in life that I don‚Äôt think I actually like (some work and personal responsibilities, mainly). K has allowed me to ‚Äúlike‚Äù those things enough to continue doing them, often enthusiastically! Shit, I even built a business in something I‚Äôm not really passionate about while on Kratom. 

I‚Äôve noticed that as my daily K intake has gone down and down, the things I was ‚Äúmeh‚Äù about...I now REALLY don‚Äôt want to do them.

Diarrhea, feeling hot, feeling cold, heart-pounding, fatigue, anxiety. When I started tapering, I still caught myself thinking that I would be able to ""use responsibly"" again in a few months, and I was hesitant to toss my scale.

And then something occurred to me, which I also wrote about in my ""How I got addicted"" post a few days ago. I remembered that when I first started using kratom, I was able to stick to just using it on Wednesday and Sunday, and taking off a whole month in January. And I realized that even then I was having problems. I spent all week looking forward to Wednesday, then again to Sunday. I couldn't enjoy the time I was in \*now\*. I only cared about how many days/hours until my next dose.

And it reminded me of an episode of Seinfeld. George's girlfriend comes down with mono, so she tells him they can't have sex until she recovers in a few weeks. George accepts the situation, and realizes he used to always think about sex. Thinking about what girl he would ask out, wondering when a new girlfriend would finally agree to having sex, etc. With no hope of sex in the near future, he wasn't focused on it, and his mind could focus on other things, and he temporarily became a super-genius. I doubt I'll become a super-genius by no longer taking kratom. But I think if I no longer focus on when I'm getting my next fix, I can better enjoy the here-and-now. I know everyone is different, but for me, I have to have ""no hope of ever having kratom again"" in order to move forward.

It‚Äôs hell on earth. I‚Äôve done kratom withdrawals without helper meds. It‚Äôs not hell on earth, but it sure does suck. 

My last kratom CT, I had a few clonidine pills that I used for the acutes. They took away the chills and sweating entirely. My sleep cycle was still terrible though. Bad RLS and constant disrupted sleep. I wasn‚Äôt really ready to quit then, though. I had 6 days sober, did ‚Äújust one three gram dose,‚Äù and fell back into daily use almost immediately. Since then, I developed a 15gpd habit for about three months. I decided that enough was enough, waited for a week I could be totally alone and take off from work, and went CT this past Friday. 

This time, I had a pretty generous script of Gabapentin along with more than enough clonidine to get me through the acutes. I have to say, with this combination of drugs, the only noticeable symptom I have is fatigue, and by day three, the fatigue seems to be fading as well. I understand that withdrawal lasts much longer than three days, but I have to say, this is BY FAR the easiest first three days I‚Äôve ever had on a detox. I only plan to use the Gabapentin until day 5-6, and I‚Äôm prescribed clonidine for anxiety so I‚Äôll continue to use that more sparingly through the coming months. 

I write this post because I see so many of you that are suffering. Your suffering can be all but alleviated with these helper meds. There seems to be a strong current of thought in this sub that claims the only ‚Äúreal‚Äù way to CT is without any helper meds. People that believe this think that unless you do it ‚Äúthe right way,‚Äù you‚Äôll just fall back into addiction. 

I can tell you for certain, I‚Äôve done it ‚Äúthe right way‚Äù multiple times and I‚Äôm still here. Detoxing once again. All my years of suffering through pain and mental anguish, and I still came back for more. I‚Äôm sure many of you have similar stories. So why, then, do so many of us believe this lie that helper meds only lead back to addiction? 

 This line of thinking smacks of ‚Äúno pain, no gain,‚Äù machismo bullshit. Do yourself a favor and get scripts for both of these meds. If your PCP won‚Äôt prescribe, call an online telemed service and say you‚Äôre withdrawing off of OxyContin. They‚Äôll prescribe them in 10 minutes.

I started using Kratom midway through the Pandemic to treat a bunch of mental health issues.

Since I seem to be fine only dosing in the morning and I don't take any throughout the rest of the day...any ideas on how fast I could taper down?

Today is day 22 CT. For me, days like this have been the hardest part. Days where depression cloud comes down and there is no pleasure in anything. The days where my mind analyzes all possible substances to bring myself back to baseline even when I don't want it to.

The point of this post is different though. It's a story from last week I wanted to get off my chest. 

Last Thursday, I was on day 18ct which, in previous quits, is where I usually cave. When the PAWS get too bad and there's no clear way out for a while, this is when I pick the habit back up again just to be a productive member of society. However, early in this quit I finally broke down and told my girlfriend about this addiction, which was a huge step for me. This was one of the hardest things I've had to do and is the biggest turning point since picking up kratom a few years ago. Now, with someone in my corner, something happened that has never happened before. 

On this day, the PAWS were intense, depression was heavy, mind and body were in pain, brain idolized kratom as the solution, so after a 16 hour long internal war, I purchased and took some. I tried to explain to my gf some addict/withdrawal logic that makes no sense as to why I could/should take it (this was after I purchased it). To be completely honest, it wasn't good and didn't help any of the real issues I was feeling, and it was immediately flushed. For the first time, seeing how truly negatively this impacts those around us was really hard. To see where my brain put this substance relative to the things that actually matter in life was scary. I do not know how to put these emotions into words... I'm sure you can understand though. That feeling of letting someone down, not being true to yourself, giving in, realizing you messed up, sadness, regret, numbness, content with the bad things in your life, physical withdrawal, fear, scared for/unsure of the future, all wrapped into one emotion that looms over your head. That's taking kratom while recovering.

But here's the important thing, anytime I've relapsed in the past after a quit, I ALWAYS restart the habit. Not just taking kratom multiple times per day again, but also resuming the bad habits that go along with it (unhealthy eating, no exercise, poor awareness of mental health). I'm here to report 4 days later that even with this one slip up from one evening, I am back on track. The evening the dose wore off I had some acute symptoms again and then it was right back to PAWS the next day. It felt like I picked up right where I left off, but I saw that kratom doesn't really help with kratom withdrawal. :)

Since it was only one dose and I never really left the 'quit' mindset I still consider myself day 22 CT for better or worse. I have very distinct daily habits not on kratom versus on kratom and I have been living the healthier life for three weeks going on four. Even though today is hard again, I had felt more like myself this past weekend and believe this week will get better. I've been catching glimpses of myself, and I want to become a new version of myself that thinks/acts like me before kratom while having the experience of addiction and recovery that will bring mindfulness to my life in the future. I don't want to go 'back' to the old me, I want to be a more aware, mentally strong, experienced, and disciplined version of myself today and in the future.

I guess the lesson is recovery isn't linear and even in our moments of weakness we can take a step forward.",9,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9936145544052124}"

I can catch my breath!,"Mental clarity has improved. Breathing has improved. Back pain has improved. I was suffering trying to catch my breath for 4 days there. But I seem ok now.I am currently taking 2.5 g - every hour and a half - for 7 doses. This totals 17.5 g. Currently 10 g less than I normally take. Perhaps a little extreme for tapering, but it appears to be working. My plan is to do this dosage for a week, get used to it, and then reduce dosage by 10 percent per week until the dosage is greatly reduced. My current state has improved, though I can not for sure attribute the improvement to the kratom, or to the 50 mg of PREDNISONE steroid that I have been given for 5 days.This morning I woke up with aching shoulders, and didnt get sleep as well as I did before the steroids. Also, the steroids are keeping my heart rate around 88-100, though my heart has often kept this pace on its own, and it is not causing shortness of breath.

My main concern at this point is, will 50 mg of prednisone for 5 days affect my tapering or cause any horrendous bounce back effects once I finish them? I have heard tales that the withdrawal from prednisone is very similar to the withdrawal from kratom. (Though only if the prednisone is taken for an extended period of time). Because I have been a user of kratom for so long, and presuming this has affected my endocrine levels.... I worry because the steroid affects your endocrine and cortisol levels, just as kratom does, this brings me a great deal of worry. The ER didn't know exactly what was wrong with me, (lungs and heart checked out fine) and I failed to mention that I have been using kratom for 4 years every day. But they did recommend I have a follow up appointment with a GP. Do you guys think I should follow up with my GP and be direct and upfront about my kratom problem, possibly getting a few blood tests, or should I just rough out the tapering by myself?

Im new to the community and this is my first post. I've been doing a lot of reading here the last couple days and confirming all of the reason I as well would like to stop. How I got to this point is kind of hard to believe but it was completely on accident. I was not intentionally searching it out, I did not hear about through another person and decided to try, and I dont really suffer from any of the known reasons why people use Kratom to begin with. It all started one day at work. I stepped outside with a coworker, he happened to be dosing at the time and he asked me if I would like to try it. He said it was a supplement that gives you energy and was better then the red bull I happened to be drinking at the time. I said ""sure, what the hell"" we all could use a little pep in our step. I didn't really feel much that day but the next day I asked him for another serving in hopes that maybe something would kick in the 2nd time around.... And it did. It was the happy euphoric feeling that came over me and I felt like I could accomplish anything, speak to anyone, do anything. I thought I found a magic supplement and was never gonna let this go. For the next week or so, he gave me multiple strains from Happy Hippo, they all had fancy nicknames and what not. From that week forward, I slowly started ordering my own (no one likes a mooch). Like many of us, I started chasing a bigger and better feeling so I increased my doses or took it more often or the combination of both. After a few months, that happy feeling slowly started to dwindle. Fast forward the clock to 18 months later and I barely feel it anymore, no matter how much I take or how often. I had no idea this stuff would have even cause WD symptoms but by the time I realized the consequences of taking this long term, it was too late. Here I am, wanting to stop but also not wanting to suffer WD. I know what WD feels like as I've experienced almost 15 years ago when I detox from H. That was a whole nother battle in life for many years but this freightens me because of how similar the mental and physical cravings are. I'm sitting here typing this not believing I'm back in this boat again. I ordered 2 packets of Stem and Vein and 2 packets of Kava. I am going to use stem and vein to slowly taper and hopefully the Kava to take any of the edge off as the doses begin to decrease. Any words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated, shipment should be here tomorrow some time so day 1 of my taper will begin Wednesday. I am planning to decrease my dosage by a 1/2 tsp each dose every 2 days. I usually dose 4 times a day right now with 3 tsp each dose. Thanks in advance for all of your supports and I'll be sure to post daily beginning Wednesday of my personal journey. Best wishes to all!

I took 2 capsules in between doses to try to take the edge off but it was hard to tell immediately what it was doing.

So the directions state to take 2 capsules with a meal. I ate around 7:30p and took another 2 caps with that and then had my last dose of kratom around 8:15pm. I wanted to see if could get thru the night and not have to wake up at 4am and be unable to sleep and then when I get up by 8am,. I would be having sneezing fits, anxiety, and rebound pain.

Well as usual I didn't feel my last dose but for some reason I couldn't sleep. It was the kratom keeping me awake! I had to wait for it to wear off completely before I fell into a solid sleep until my alarm went off at 7:55am.

This was the best sleep I've had in a while but my last kratom dose hasn't been keeping me up at night. I usually have insomnia from dosing too close to bedtime so I was not dosing past 5pm. I did some research and got some chocolate kratom and for the first time I was able to sleep and dose it at 8pm.

So I suspect the BSO bumped up the kratom effects and gave me insomnia until it wore off. I can tell it's the kratom keeping me awake by being so wide awake and that sleeping meds don't work but hit me hard when kratom wears off.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to remedy this? 
How often should I need the 2 capsule dose? The time I need support is bedtime overnight but am wondering if I should just drop my bedtime dose even lower so it won't keep me awake? I'm one of those retards that never feels sedative effects from any strain of kratom. I envy those that sleep easy on it. My brother tried kratom but gave it up bc it was ""too sedating and relaxing."" SMH

It is my 6th time doing this, my 4th time I was off of it for 2 months roughly. I am ready and need to get off of this, as I am a very busy guy and kratom at this point is making me very lazy. There are other reasons of course, but that one is the main reason.

I feel like my failure of not quitting kratom comes from a lot of personal issues I have been experiencing that causes a lot of  anxiety and depression... I also have a bad back injury that has made it very difficult to quit. I am making this for others to see my journey quitting this, and also for accountability. I will go through each day as I had before in my journey of quitting and add updates and how I am quitting.

I will list a few things that made the quit a lot easier to bare through (Of course not any magic bullets or anything).

**Disclaimer**: I am not a doctor, ask your doctor before you take anything! I will be listing low dose DXM, which if you are taking an antidepressant can cause serotonin syndrome. Goo to your doctor first before taking anything.

First here is what I am taking to reduce withdrawals and lower my tolerance quickly so withdrawals do not take as long to go through:

1. Low Dose DXM, 30mg (NMDA antagonist and increases serotonin) (every 4-6 hours)
2. Agmatine 500mg-1000mg (works on Œ±2-adrenergic receptor for weaker withdrawals) (every 2-4 hours).
3. magnesium 400mg x2 a day
4. black seed oil (I usually just squirt a little in my mouth 2-3 times a day)
5. vitamin C 2000mg x2 a day
6. CDP-choline 750 mg a day (Has been shown to increase dopamine receptor densities)
7. xanax (For getting sleep the first 2 nights of not being on kratom)(first night 0.75mg, 2nd night 0.50mg)
8. phenylpiracetam (The  best thing for a pick me up and getting work done) (200mg every other day)
9. General supplements for aid: L-theanine,  lion manes mushroom, DLPA, multi-vitamin, glycine, bacopa.

My plan as of 3/29/2021:

\- For 4-5 days take away morning dose, keep night dose for sleep.

\- Have 3 days reducing my night dose.

\- Jump from kratom and use xanax as needed.

I usually take 5-8g of green horned maeng da per dose, sometimes with turmeric.

Wish me luck! I will be back!

**Updates:**

*update* \#1 (3/29/21): Today I was able to make it through the day, have the general symptoms of withdrawal. motivation was zero, so getting some work done was very hard, which is expected. So far off to a good start. dysphoria and anxiety are manageable. Back pain is really bad, have a herniated disk, so pain is going down my left leg. Usually don't have this pain, but withdrawals heightens the pain. Will be back tomorrow!

&#x200B;

update #2 (3/30/21-4/2/2021): whew ok the past couple days were hard and did not perfectly follow the plan above. The good news is my tolerance/withdrawals are decreased enough where taking agmatine, low dose d-x-m and black seed oil, I feel normal and even have some energy for work. The last hurdle to conquer, is going to sleep without kratom. I am planning on using kratom tonight and on sunday night. I have a big meeting on monday so having good sleep is important. For saturday night I will use the xanax to get some sleep. By monday I should be able to get some sleep without  kratom, but might take till wednesday for some form of normal sleep (according too the timeline I last quit). Good luck to everyone! Will be back soon.

P.S. I have a limited supply of kratom and when its gone, its gone... this is apart of my method to quitting.",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9989944100379944}"

How I started this quit, how much I hate the struggles this has given me, my anxieties, this that and the other. But here on day 21, I‚Äôm extremely happy to report that... this week wasn‚Äôt that bad.

It wasn‚Äôt the physical struggle of week 1, it wasn‚Äôt the mental struggle of week 2. It was by no means easy, I had my first ‚Äúreal‚Äù experience with post acutes. But the last 168 hours have been so much better compared to the first two. I can‚Äôt stress it enough, it has legitimately gotten better. Better than I could have hoped, even when it was awful. It was better than the near daily struggle I had while on kratom.

Every hour I lost of sleep that first and second week. Every hour obsessed with trying to make it to the hour after, and every hour of fear I had feels very much worth it tonight.

I try not to give advice, I know my brain is beyond melted and what works for me probably sounds beyond moronic to others. But I will say, this week‚Äôs major coping mechanism was ‚Äúthe Pok√©mon countdown‚Äù. At some point in obsessively keeping track of hours, I noticed I had 150 hours left until the end of another week. My nerd brain kicked in and said ‚Äújust dedicate an hour to each of the original 150. When you real Bulbasaur the week is over‚Äù. So I did. Some hours it meant nothing to me, some hours I just repeated their names as I paced around. Some I read the wiki page on them two or three times. But it kept me busy, and when all you want is more hours off kratom, busy mental work is perfect.

I‚Äôll leave you with this: when I first posted here maybe 20 days ago, I saw others and their updates. I saw numbers I thought were impossible. 14 days, 20 days, 50 days. I felt like I‚Äôd cry if I could make it two weeks without slamming sludge. I‚Äôd count on my fingers just how many days I‚Äôd have to live to see day 17. If I could. And now? That same desire to make it further exists, but now it feels possible. And if you keep yourself honest and focused about staying off the horse shit that is kratom (probably anything), you can too. I hope you all have a good week, and with any luck my next rambling will be more about how great things were another 168 hours clean.",28,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9037958383560181}"

Depression has always plagued me, and cannabis does a hell of a job providing temporary, functional relief but is illegal in my area, which is why I thought I‚Äôd explore kratom. Joblessness and unachieved ambition are my two major stressors, as well as over eating and aching joints. 15 gpd for 18 months, not a severe habit by any means , but enough to mask my depression symptoms and anxiety , even though by the end I was using just to avoid withdrawals. 

I decided to quit even in the middle of rehabbing a knee I had surgery on to remove meniscus tear. I am convinced the sludge has damaged my intestinal tract to the point of me now having an auto immune disease. I am also convinced it has dehydrated my body to the point of leaving my cartilage malnourished and susceptible to tears or injuries. So I threw away almost 2 kilos and went ct 2 days after the super bowl..

There was really only one bad physical withdrawal day, that being the first one. Maybe about 20 hours of absolute discomfort but surprisingly that passed fast. Mentally I am still struggling big time. I have been going through the worst depression and anxiety of my life, to the point that when the negative thoughts come, so do the shooting, random auto immune pains in my joints, gut, and a random place sometimes. I‚Äôm getting checked out by a doctor and labs this week, will see if permanent damage exists and I now have a neurological disorder, or an auto immune disease, or perhaps something else. 

I used a 5mg hydrocodone left over grim my surgery before a dentist visit I had, and be damned if my depression wasn‚Äôt even worse the next two days. Is it just circumstantial, or did just having one teeny bit of opioids set me back in recovery? I mean wow if kratom addiction and subsequent recovery can be this gd depressing, it‚Äôs crippling , it‚Äôs non stop negative thoughts .

So much progress yet now I feel more stuck than ever. When I get down to a manageable dose that doesnt make me feel like total shit all the time my brain starts telling me that this is actually sustainable, and this is an ok amount to take. I know it isnt. I want to treat my ADHD, I want to treat my depression, i want to be in control of my life and kratom is just this weird bandaid that keeps me in limbo. Helps me drag my feet through the day but is a total blockage to real self improvement. I get in a good groove with scheduled dosing and slowly lowering the amount but then something ALWAYS happens. No matter how strong my conviction at the beginning of the day to keep to the schedule there will always be a reason to take a little bit more. An extra long or stressful day at work (i sometimes work 16+ hours), or a day off where I am just trying to avoid the feeling of crippling boredom, or maybe I got a date, and im like ok, gotta do a few extra grams so I can be less introverted.

I need it out of my life. That being said, I just started today my next (and second to last) taper drop of .3 grams off each dose. That brings me down to .5 gram doses 6 times a day, 3.0 grams total! I used to take mounded heaps on a big walmart spoon (had a drawer full of them, threw most of them away the other night) equaling 10 grams at my highest, and that was 7 times a day. I am now literally taking 1/20th of my highest dose! Wow. It's been a long 4 months, but just wow.. I never thought I would see the day I got down this low.

I still have massive panic attacks, and still have skin feeling like it's on fire at times, but we've realized that I am super sensitive to these drops so we started doing them every 7 days instead of every 5 days... So we are dropping somewhere around 37.5% of my daily intake for the last 7 days, which is the highest percentage drop we've done since the very first big drop that started the taper. Is this week going to suck? Oh yes. But in two weeks I won't have to worry about it anymore :)

And I've noticed that during the moments when I am feeling okay, which there are more and more of them than there used to be, I feel REALLY okay. Like better than I used to feel in the small 20 minute window of my largest kratom dose working.. Definitely realizing that kratom NEVER actually made me feel that good...

Stress pops up that I used to justify huge doses of kratom for (like having to wait in line at the bank for 35 minutes because some old dude has fraud alerts and wants to give the teller a hard time for a half hour).. but as I start to panic I remember, I used to hate waiting in line even on my highest dose of kratom... Stressful day at work? Going up in dose is not an option because I still had stress at work when I was taking 70 grams per day..

I can say that my back pain has come back with a vengeance, but that's par for the course trying to get off this stuff... back pain is what started me taking pain pills and kratom, it was the wrong answer then, and it's the wrong answer now. So I bought a foam roller and have been stretching my back every day, tiny improvements, but I'm used to those by now...

You can view my previous posts if you visit my profile if you're interested in the development. As the title says, I'm on day 30 CT.

In physical terms, I'm mostly fine. My digestion is still a little screwed but that's to be expected. Also my sleep is a little unsteady and I often wake up in the middle of the night, but luckily I also fall asleep again without much trouble. Whether I feel rested in the morning or not seems to be totally random though. 

I don't really experience cravings, I sometimes think about Kratom but the thought of it vanishes just as quickly, I'm 100% sure though that if at any point during the last 30 days I had direct access to it, I would've relapsed. Luckily not having any K around me is big enough of a barrier to keep me clean.

On the mental side, I'm experiencing a lot of anhedonia and depression in the sense that I struggle to get anything done beyond the basics like getting up in the morning, showering, getting dressed, walking the dog, grocery shopping etc. 

There is a profound feeling of a complete lack of interest in anything and I feel numb, heavy, slow and foggy. There have been a few days though where I felt like my mind had cleared up and even social situations that would've caused me great anxiety were not much of a problem, I hope these kinda days become more frequent but I tend to dwell in a more pessimistic mindstate currently.

To my own surprise, I managed to incorporate a regular workout into my routine for the past 15 days, exercising 5 to 6 days a week. I hope that will benefit me in some way down the line. For a few hours after I'm done working out I feel pretty good, that peaceful sense of exhaustion, but this of course doesn't last indefinitely.

So yeah, that's my current state, I'll probably check back in in 10 days, wish you all strength! :)

But I forgot that I had used a bit extra a few days ago when I had some RLS. So if that happens tonight, I'll just be using magnesium and ambien.

I know a rapid taper is not the best method. A slow taper avoids withdrawals, and going cold turkey gets it over with faster. A rapid taper does neither of these things. But with a slow taper, I kept cheating. After going lower a few times I kept thinking, ""Well, I'll just take a little more now, and start tapering again tomorrow."" Since I didn't feel any withdrawals, I didn't really feel like I was setting myself back by cheating.

But I think in my case, I needed to experience some withdrawals. The runny nose, headaches, and RLS weren't too bad. But the fatigue and lack of motivation really sucked. I wasn't very productive at work this week, and my apartment is messy. And that's what's stopping me from taking higher doses again - knowing that if I go back to 50gpd, then this crappy week will have been for nothing. I can really see how much of a setback it would be if I were to start using again. I'm hoping that will carry me through the next several weeks with no kratom. I think the last time I had a day without taking it was last year in May.

I have about 9 different strains and 2 different kinds of extracts. I assume to skip the extracts, but should I just use one strain to taper? I have had single strain syndrome before which is why I have so many. Or is that a ploy to get people to buy multiple strains?

I was doing 3 gpd reductions every 3 days.

Can I go faster and how can I use my supplements to help my taper?

I am quitting phenibut again, too, which I have done painlessly a couple times and use agmatine, NAC, baclofen, and lyrica. Could any of those besides agmatine help with the taper? And how to use them?

Unexpected delay of shipment,"I've been taking kratom from a long time. I'm a 33 year old man from England and when I got started on it several years ago, I couldn't believe the benefits of it, but it quickly ramped up to using it several times a day. I did quit a few times for months apart over the years but always kept coming back.

I got dumped by my long term gf unexpectadly 5 years ago, and started using again and besides a 5 month break, have used it ever since. I needed something to help with my depression of a few break ups and my anxiety that I've had throughout my life.

So recently I've been using more and more, and got up to as much as 65g's a day, for several months at a time.

It's a really tricky situation as I got hooked whilst it was legal in the UK. However randomly all psychoactive substances were made illegal a few years ago, but I was still hooked. So up until now I've been importing it in, I assume illegally from Netherlands masked under ""moringa tea"".

Never had a problem with delivery, pretty much always next day delivery. I knew my doses were causing me more harm than good, but planned on reducing a lot recently and eventually quit.

However last week I made an order due to arrive on friday. And instead of being delivered, it arrived into the UK and has been stuck in a ""clearance event"" all week. I tried ordering another a couple days later, and the same thing happened. This scared the cr\*p out of me, as even though I was planning to quit, I wasn't ready to quit from such a heavy amount. I planned to taper and believe I have the will power to do it as have before.  I'm wondering if they have been held up because of Brexit as never had a problem before. It may be seized but I'd imagine the shipper (DHL express) would have contacted me for more documents before doing that. Tried contacted DHL with emails several times and they keep saying its with customs and needs to be checked and mention nothing about a potential seizure. Just most days updated with ""clearance event"" and no more updates and was supposed to be next day delivery.

So I'm a bit scared now and wasn't prepared for this. So at the start of the week until now I've got my dose down to 10g from 65g and I've only got 23g's left. I'm hopeful the parcel will arrive as I need more time. I was even tempted to order more from another company if I hear nothing by tomorrow, and just take the risk. But not sure if I'd be better sending to a different address.

I'm a postman so have a very physically demanding job. This week has been really tough. And the last few nights had restless legs and barely any sleep.

I'm wondering what I should do. Would I be better off having like 5g's a day for next 4-5 days and then jumping or just jumping now. Or do you think trying to get another bag may help make it easier. Still hopeful my other orders will arrive.

I'm hoping that the withdrawels will be bearable and won't have to try and be sick off work.

I eventually knew it was fucked up I didn‚Äôt care I thought it was helping in my life.

My SO went away with my kids for a week about 3 weeks ago so I tried to use it as an opportunity to quit. I managed to taper a bit but I didn‚Äôt even go a single day without.

When they came back I was using less, but it really opened my eyes to how addictive this shit is I really didn‚Äôt think it would be that hard.

All the while I have this insane tooth pain and I go see a dentist one Friday afternoon and schedule a root canal for two weeks later. Next morning, Saturday I wake up in horrible pain and I wind up at urgent care to get pain meds. They prescribed me enough tramodol to get me through the weekend. I decided to try only taking the scrip and it was fine I had no WD‚Äôs. Lol. Monday morning I call my dentist to move up my appointment and I successfully get one for the following day. I legit thought I was home free that the tramodol was going to get me through the worst part of my kratom WD and after i finish the course it‚Äôd be a walk in the park. Holy fuck was I ever wrong.
Wednesday afternoon the day after my root canal I had some pretty bad WD‚Äôs and I caved and did a  single 2g dose and went home after work wound up in a huge argument with my SO, she wound up going to her parents with my youngest for the night. I knew I had to stop and I did that was the last time I‚Äôve used. The last three days have been hell. I finally am having moments in my day where I‚Äôm feeling ok. I keep crying for no reason. 

it is hard as fuck to have a busy job and a family. All I want to do is go to bed but I can‚Äôt sleep the body aches and the anxiety are through the roof. 

TLDR

Tried to quit 3 weeks ago but only tapered
One week ago I swapped kratom for prescription opiates. Stopped the opiates on Tuesday took one last dose on Wednesday and have been getting rid of my stashes all week when I get the chance. I feel like absolute shit, but I do feel way better than yesterday and the day before. I have not had the urge to actually take it. The desire to be free is still stronger than having immediate relief 

PS I do not recommend the prescription opiates even for a short time I‚Äôm pretty fucking sure it didn‚Äôt work as id hoped because it‚Äôs been hell.

I felt *amazing*, it felt just like the percocet that I'd gotten from my wisdom teeth 4-5 years ago, but it was cheap to boot! This was a wonderful discovery I thought to myself, and for a while, it was. 

Kratom mixed well with everything. I took kratom with weed, I took kratom with psychedelics, I took kratom with benzos, I took kratom with MDMA, I took kratom with stimulants, I took kratom with EVERYTHING, every day, several times a day, for YEARS. 

I haven't used anything except kratom since January 2020, but I just haven't had the willpower to shake it.  I tried tapering so many times, but I'd always cave and take a full dose and next thing I know I was at stage 0 all over again. 

I get THE WORST withdrawals from kratom. Even taking my normal dosage schedule I'll still start feeling withdrawals 30-45m before my scheduled dose. I wake up 2-3 times a night in cold sweats and intense muscle aches and take kratom, waiting for it to kick in so I can finally go back to sleep. This has been my routine for years now, and my sleep has suffered incredibly the whole time. Nowadays I only get a desirable effect from kratom maybe every 1/4 doses. The other times I'll get acid reflux, nausea, and headaches. 

3 weeks ago I received an offer for my dream job in another state. This was it, the big time. My first real job out of university making more than I was even asking for. I couldn't ask for a better opportunity if I tried. It was now that I decided, I needed to begin tapering immediately. My regular dosing schedule was 1.6g every 3 hours (I'm more sensitive to kratom than most it seems, much more than that I get really bad nausea). I'm down to 300mg every 3 1/2 hours. Even at this miniscule dosing schedule that I very gradually have gone down to over 3 weeks, I still feel terrible withdrawals. IDK how, but such small doses still give me a small but noticeable effect. I'm sitting here writing this shit while my muscles ache and my body goes hot and cold while waiting for my next tiny dose.

I believed people when they said the withdrawals were no worse than caffeine. I've dropped caffeine for tolerance reasons before, and it wasn't even close to the same level of terrible as kratom withdrawals for me. I believed them when they said this shit wasn't addictive.  

I fly out in 5 days. I want to be free of this shit before then. It's such a goddamn struggle, especially mixed with the intense anxiety involved with moving across the country at 23 by myself.

I‚Äôm having a really hard time, the tapering feels like it‚Äôs not working anymore. I‚Äôve been taking kratom for a little over 3 years. About 30-40 gpd. I started a tapering system on February 8 2021. The taper starts at 30gpb spli up into 3 doses throughout the day. I‚Äôve stuck to the tapering chart, and it‚Äôs been going well for the most part, until about 5 days ago. Ever since I got to around 15gpb I started getting symptoms of withdrawal. Every night I‚Äôm covered in sweat. Body always aches, extreme depression etc etc. I‚Äôm not new to any of this, I quit heroin cold turkey in November 2017, so withdrawals aren‚Äôt new, just kind of surprising coming from kratom. After about 3 months clean I started doing kratom. I thought at first it would just be an occasional thing and it quickly turned into a life controlling substance. I‚Äôm not afraid I‚Äôll relapse on heroin or anything, I know I won‚Äôt. I guess what I‚Äôm wondering is, will these withdrawal symptoms continue on even after I‚Äôm completely off kratom? Any words would be greatly appreciated. I also just want to say, although I‚Äôve never posted here, I‚Äôve been on the boards reading for quite awhile, months before I started to taper. I can‚Äôt begin to describe how thankful I am for all the words of encouragement on here (even if not directed towards me) just reading other people‚Äôs accounts of what they went through does wonders for ones will power and psyche.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9969712495803833}"

I hate to admit it, but Adderall has always been an important component of my work life.

It jumpstarts all the right moods and mental processes for me. It makes me feel inspired instead of bored. It makes me excited about the possibilities of success rather than the anxious about failure. It allows me to forget feelings of loneliness and inadequacy and get obsessed about work. it gives me dogged determination to keep hammering away instead of getting easily frustrated. It gives me the confidence to send that crazy email instead of feeling stupid and embarrassed.

I have experienced tremendous professional success due to adderall. I hate to admit it, but all of the ambitious first steps I made that turned into something Great have been done under the influence of Adderall.

after taking it for several years, occasionally I would start to get a bit anxious or restless on it.

something changed a few years ago when I discovered Kratom. in the beginning I was very careful not to mix Kratom with other drugs. but one fateful day feeling a little jittery on Adderall and craving that smooth opiate relief of kratom I made the mistake of combining them.

it got me really high, almost manically optimistic and enthusiastic, all of the endless energy and focus of Adderall balanced by The anti-anxiety it will all be OK warm glow of Kratom.

overtime this turned in to my preferred combination, and I‚Äôd start every day by taking them together.

I have made tremendous professional accomplishments under the influence of this cocktail. it allowed me to shut off the negative anxious voice in my head and do things I always wanted. I started a successful business. I'd build it in short spurts of overexcited obsessiveness. 

but this was a dangerous combination, it made me incredibly impulsive. i‚Äôd neglect personal hygiene, go weeks without leaving my apartment, and then started getting into the habit of using alcohol to help with the inevitable comedown. I‚Äôd tell myself, ‚Äúfuck the real world, you‚Äôre not the man you want to be, you‚Äôre not getting the results you want with people in day today life. The most important thing you can do is whatever it takes to shut the world out and spend as much time alone focusing on the computer working to improve your position in life‚Äù

this worked good, until it didn‚Äôt. and every few weeks, usually after a few days of being sleep deprived and feeling hungover, usually a sunday. I‚Äôd have a little panic attack about all the things I was neglecting and how fucked up my life was.

i‚Äôm afraid the years of abusing this combination have ruined Adderall for me. I can‚Äôt take Adderall without Kratom now. all of the original focus and optimism are gone, if I take it without Kratom, I just feel super anxious and restless.

this is a particular problem because I can‚Äôt work to maintain the business that I‚Äôve built without them. i‚Äôve tried many times. I don‚Äôt have a problem taking a few weeks off if I‚Äôm on a family vacation or something, and besides feeling a bit tired and moody no major withdrawal symptoms.

but trying to focus on work, forget about it. The smallest tasks that I would feel excited about attacking turn into the most impossible painful monotonous numbing torture. 

I really have a problem here, I‚Äôm thinking the only way I‚Äôm going to be able to get out of this is just a quit everything cold turkey and slowly work my way into work habits like a normal person. I won‚Äôt feel ecstatic and inspired working every day, but no one does.

Delayed W/D's?,"Today is day 12 off of a CT jump of 30-40gpd. My last dose was noon on a Friday. Obviously the first 3-4 days sucked, but the bulk of it was eaten up by the weekend, so it wasn't that bad. I had all the symptoms, especially the chills. I focused on exercise, water, diet, supplements, sleep, etc. and just powered through it...

The first week back to work was so-so, and I actually felt great going into the weekend. I thought I'd enjoy the change in the weather, so Sunday morning I went mountain biking for almost 3 hours. I threw up 2-3x during the ride, but I chalked this up to the Saturday night booze+being out of shape from not riding all winter.

Sunday everything took a turn. As I got home and started cleaning my bike I felt ill. I ended up going to sleep at like 8pm. The next day (this past Monday), morning was ok, but by 4pm I was dying and I went home from work early. I went to sleep at like 6pm and tossed and turned all night.

Yesterday (Tuesday), felt like full-blown acute withdrawals again. I took the day off work. Flu symptoms - chills/sweats/vomiting/upset stomach/no energy/head ache/depression. All I managed to do was lay under a heap of blankets and watch netflix all day. Again a night of restless sleep.

Which brings me to today. I still feel like garbage, but I have so much work I cannot avoid going into the office. I've already thrown up 2x this morning and have had cold sweats on and off.

\*I also quit smoking 12 days ago when I quit kratom, and I have significantly cut back on the booze. Can the hormonal effects of all these changes be what is kicking in now - a delayed withdrawal? 

\*Or is it too late for this window? Maybe the withdrawals and 3-hour mtn bike ride weakened my immune system and I caught a cold/stomach bug..?

Either way, it is hard not imagining a simple teaspoon of kratom into a quick drink may relieve all of this, but I'm trying to keep fighting the good fight towards sobriety.

You get to a point where your physical symptoms are maybe 25% of what they were at the start. Around the end of the first 7 days, you're feeling optimistic. Still shitty, but you're pepped up because you can start to feel yourself really healing. One struggle however persists, fucking sleep! Sometime around the second week, you hit a massive wall. You're constantly exhausted. The 2 hours of sleep a night has finally caught up with you. You feel just as bad as day one. 

This is incredibly frustrating. I am ready to exit the roller coaster, I am ready to move on with my life. It is exceedingly difficult to stay productive like this.

I'm so glad I found this sub. I've been on kratom since 2013, and advocated for that shit. I still don't think it should become illegal. Fuck the war on drugs. I have chronic pain, depression, and anxiety. I got pretty fucked up on pills, and when I got off those, I became an alcoholic. Kratom changed all that for me and I'm grateful. I even spent a good 4 years off antidepressants. But I've been extremely unmotivated and just generally down for a few years now. I've also struggled with my weight. I became very underweight, and just recently managed to get up to 100 lbs (still underweight for me but better). About a year ago I got back on lexapro but as my dose raised, I had scary neurological symptoms. Incapacitating tremors, possibly some kind of seizure. I'd had at least 2 seizures before, one before kratom, one after. I always attributed them to SSRIs but now I'm not so sure about the later one, and my recent tremors. Tomorrow I start Effexor instead and I'm terrified. I also have hair loss but that runs in my family so I'm not sure if it has anything to do with kratom. Anyway, I just bought a scale because I was just using a tablespoon. About 1.5 tbsp a dose, several times a day. I'm going to have to try some kind of taper because I'm in college (at 41!) and have a couple teenagers to keep my eye on. Since I have very little self control, my mom is going to hold onto my big bag for me and give me little bits at a time. Oh, I'm also trying to get off Klonopin 1-2mg a day, but I probably ought to hold off on that... If I can keep getting it. Not sure where I'm going with this but I just wanted to introduce myself and say thank you for the wealth of information. I really hope fucking with my serotonin so much doesn't kill me.

It was too valuable of a tool for me for managing my chronic back pain. I broke my spine at 17 by falling off of a ladder and I've been dealing with the after affects of that ever since (I'm 30 now). I was up to anywhere between 15-30gpd depending on how bad my muscles were locked up on a given day.

However the isolation of lockdown was starting to get to me, and I have a history of major depressive episodes, and I was starting to feel it come back in ways that was genuinely impairing my ability to drive, work, etc. So I got back on an antidepressant that's helped me before: Wellbutrin. Well I've been on it for 2 weeks now and I just now realized: I haven't thought about Kratom once in the last 72 hours at least. I haven't even had so much as a runny nose. This is very strange. I suppose I'll keep it up as long as I can manage, and I'm just gonna throw this out into the ether: if you've had trouble quitting cold turkey consider asking a doctor about trying Wellbutrin (I personally take 300mg/day). I went from being a daily kratom user for the last 4-5 years with absolutely no intention of quitting, to forgetting that kratom exists entirely by accident. **Not a suggestion you should consider if you or your family have a history of epilepsy**, and your mileage may vary, but it's just a crazy experience I had that I wanted to throw out there for anyone who finds they are out of ideas.

Like best night's sleep in ages.

So what did I do?  I starting doing this every night and guess what?  It worked the first night, sorta not really worked the second night and now I've done it 5 nights in a row with no benefit but I can tell my WD are feeling worse during the day.  Now I have to remove the red from my sleep and pay the price for being an idiot.  This has set back my taper and I was sooo close to .7 at bed and .5 when I wake up around 4am in hopes of catching another hour of sleep.  Tonight I shall try to sleep without the red at all and I'm dreading it but I knew better.  I flushed the red down the toilet so I only have my non-enhanced green left.

My quit story is brief and somewhat bizarre. I was addicted to kratom, badly. I booked two nights at my local casino. The first thing in as I packed my bags was my kratom, magnesium citrate, and tumeric capsules for the ""ritual"". I admit to an addictive personality and, well, at least I have some insight into this. Apparently, I am more addicted to gambling than I was to kratom. After eight hours at the casino, I realized that I had missed my last dose. My shoulders starting aching and a headache came on. I figured that I would just tough it out until my next dose. Again, I was gathering chips and working through some aches and that headache. Eventually, I went to my hotel room and I hadn't eaten for at least eight hours. I forgot to take my kratom and activators again. The headache and body aches were getting worse. I tried to sleep and awoke two hours later in a soaking night sweat. I became very cold. I took a bath (something I only do when I feel like I can't stand up because I'm 6'2""). It was around 5:00 AM. I realized that I hadn't taken my kratom; however, I was certain that this was the flu. I took my morning dose with activators and waited to see if this would do the trick. Surprisingly, for the first time ever with kratom, I vomited a couple times. I don't puke often and I mind throwing up, a lot. I could see that I had thrown up the kratom. I had only ingested it 20 minutes prior to the porcelain goddess episode. I did not attempt to redose because throwing up is a real deterrent for me. I had two more nights where I sweat profusely and a duller headache with duller aching began on day three. On day four, I was absolutely experiencing minor psychosis, paranoia, and anger. I behaved deplorably with my sister and brother saying hurtful things. Time can heal the wounds; however, my love affair with kratom had ended. I will never touch it again. I found it easier to get off of numerous opiates. Kratom may have some health benefits; however, I will never touch the stuff again. That's my story. Gambling, accidentally, helped kickoff a cold turkey quitting of kratom for me. This is not a promotion for gambling. It is a suggestion that if one can keep busy with something that they like during a cold turkey quit it can help. It was murder to quit and I was only taking two grams twice daily! I never missed a day though and I'm certain that's how I got where I was.

I decided to get a new job and quit my old one last friday and start it next monday the 22nd. Do you guys think the chills and stuff will be somewhat gone by then? I don't want to be miserable on my first day at my new job.

Day 0 for me again. This will be my third (and final) quit. I just took my last dose. My first quit was in Oct of 2019 - that is when I took the most daily, up to over 60 gpd. I tried tapering for a bit, but that doesn't work for me, so I finally quit after a few months of failing on the tapers. I relapsed around the holidays ""to give Santa a bit of extra energy"", and that relapse lasted 9 months until Sept. of 2020. I wasn't up to nearly as much at that time, and the quit wasn't too bad. I'd done plenty of research and followed the awesome advise found here - Wim Hof (which I love), exercise, meditation, supplements, etc. I was doing extremely well - great mentally and physically (save for some pretty significant GI issues, which perhaps I'll get into later) and like the addict I am, decided that Santa needed a little extra boost again. Dumb. And just like the first time, I've taken it every day since. For January and part of February, I was getting that wonderful feeling (often times I still do). I'm up to about 10-30 gpd, depending on my mood and schedule, etc. - usually around 15 gpd. Unlike in the past though, rather than buying in bulk I've been hitting up the smoke shop - saying ""just a little dose for today"" - so it has been much more expensive. I had made a ton of headway on my digestion - spending most of last year working on it with diet, stretches, exercise, etc - and now the issues are intensifying again. My mind can be so frustrating... I am getting very concerned that I will cause permanent damage (if I haven't already) if I don't knock this off. Quitting this time has been so difficult because it hasn't destroyed my personality and energy yet (although I know what is coming) and still gives me some euphoria.

Given my last two quits, I don't expect the acutes to be too bad and I'm also not too worried about the PAWS... we'll see how they go. But I just haven't had the mental strength to jump and I really need your support (this community was crucial for my first quit). You are all amazing. A few days ago I told my sister-in-law that I have relapsed, otherwise no one in my local circle knows. It is trivial for me to pop into the head shop after I drop my kids off at school, so I just haven't had the willpower and there has been zero accountability.

If you don't hear from me for a few days, please ping me. I'll pop back in daily for the next week to share my experience. In exchange for some accountability, hopefully I can help some some others who are struggling. I appreciate you all very much - thank you for the support and inspiration!",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9882772564888}"

Never really measured how much. Sometimes a level t-spoon, sometimes 2 heaping t-spoons, anywhere from 3 times a day to 7-8 x‚Äôs.

I spend the morning with my Dad, and, while I love him dearly, I have always had a bit of anxiety with our relationship. When I began using Kratom I found it **very** appealing to use before we would hang out, thus completely smoothing over any social anxiety issues I might have otherwise had.

Now, yesterday was the first time I had seen him in person since I quit and pretty much from the time I woke up I had these monstrous cravings. I felt like I was physically being compelled to get up and go to the shop. I resisted though and we had a really lovely time. Afterwards I was in a really happy and bubbly state of mind which I have found can be troubling in it's own way. I think that over time my brain began to associate euphoria with K, so now when I experience it my mind goes to K and I get really intense cravings to ""keep the burn going"".

Anyhow, he left and since I was near the shop I used to go to I stupidly decided to walk to the shop. It is in this larger mall and so I went inside, smelled that damn smell that I will forever associate with Kratom now (there is a perfume store in the mall and so there is always this lovely concoction of smells wafting through the place). I walked over to the shop....and didn't go in. I sat in a chair right beside the door and just thought for a while.

It was very busy inside. Throughout the pandemic the owner has never required people to wear masks in the shop and does not wear one themself. I listened to the people inside and the sounds they made, and I thought about how much I *actually* want to use and the thing is I realized when it came down to it that I just did not have as much magnetism to the stuff as I had before. I'm almost 50 days out now and, being so close to relapsing, I had this moment of realization where I recognized that in my heart of hearts I don't want that anymore.

Today I still am having cravings, and I don't know how much those will abate with time, but I am proud of yesterday. I told my gf about it when I got home (she has helped me immensely through the quitting process) and she was so happy and proud. I just wanted to share this anecdote in the hopes that someone in a similar position may gain strength from it.

Don't Know How to Stop The Bleeding!,"We don't get to tell life not to happen when we are trying to get off Kratom.   I wish you all the best in getting/staying off Kratom.  

Baseline was 12.5 before a new batch.  Now I have no idea what it is.   

I got really bad news about my cats of 13 years, one much worse than the other.  

They are my support animals.  I need to be strong.  I'm falling apart.  (Please don't say they are only pets)  They are all I really got.  

Most important, the one sicker cat needs subcutaneous fluids and if I'm able to give she may last months or even years instead of days.  I need to be calm and in control.  

I need to be strong and the Kratom withdrawals are choking me.

I don't want to waste your time crying about my emotions and how I got a bad deal.  I need help on how to adjust my Kratom taper.  How to find baseline.  

I have a one year Kratom habit.  About six months ago it got up to 25g a day.  I tapered down, painfully to 8g a day and was hurting but I was beginning to stabilize there.  I messed up and gave myself slack swearing to never go over 10g a day.  

Recently my habit crept up to 12.5g a day.   I made the decision to taper down but I was out of Kratom.  I had some red but it was for falling asleep. 

I had to buy enough to once-and-for-all get off Kratom and I was going to use this group as support.  I cannot go cold turkey even if I didn't have heartache, fear and regret.  I tried once and thought for sure I was having a heart attack.  

I quit drinking after many years; it's been over seven since I had a drink.  I know what stopping forever means.

My regular vendor had not been consistent in strength; I ended up throwing out bad batches.  Many here told me not to buy from them.  So after asking around decided to try what appeared to be most recommended vendor.  

Unfortunately, the strain almost everyone recommended was all sold out.  I figured no big deal and got a four-way split so I could avoid building up a tolerance to any one strain.

So the new kratom arrived and by the time I reached 12.5 it wasn't even 6:00 PM and I stay up late.  So I'm withdrawing hardcore and I cannot deal with my new problems in my life.  I knew I needed to take more and I felt horrible about it.   I was panicking.

I never felt high but was able to hold off serious withdrawals.  The problem was it took 20g a day.  All four strains required between 17.5-22.5g a day (last four days)  They were almost all half as strong as what I was used to taking.  The only thing I have established is it seems like 22.5g a day was highest I need to hold off major withdrawals.  

I wondered if all the stress made withdrawals worse.  But I know the physical symptoms and pain of withdrawal.  Keeping it under 22.5 is challenging.  

So now with all the pain and the major challenge of giving my cat some IV fluids daily I'm falling apart.

How do I find baseline?  Four different strains, all weak.  I am open to any of your solutions even writing the new vendor and complaining or throwing it all out.  I'm liable to make an even worse mistake.  

We all know this is a dangerous game--using kratom.  

Like alcohol--our body craves it more than our minds can control.

I don‚Äôt have tricks or plans. I just have to write something down in this dark ass room before my head pops. With that out of the way...

Seven days, twelve hours, and thirt five minutes clean. I keep a running tally in my head for some reason of just how long it has been. Getting off of kratom popped into my head during the summer. I was on a trip for work, able to drive since it was ‚Äúreasonably close‚Äù. About hour 7 of the drive I could feel something was off. It was my heart this time, and it was fucked beyond repair. Nothing new really, my intestines and liver had also been fucked beyond repair. But kratom kept anxiety away sometimes, I didn‚Äôt know how else to cope.

So for the next week I continued to dose, every moment I had a free thought immediately went to ‚Äúkratom did this, I was fine before‚Äù. And when I got home, I was too scared to see a doctor. It was time to quit, at least my body could fail in sobriety. And I did quit, for a few days. 12 if I remember correctly. In those 12 days I was WEBMD‚Äôs greatest enthusiast. Every day checking everything about my body, looking for signs of this and that. And all the things I was afraid of, all the health issues and the anxiety of what kratom had done to me slowly dissipated. ‚ÄúIt was all in my mind. This shit makes me crazy. Well let‚Äôs go buy some, and we‚Äôll only do it on weekends. We won‚Äôt hit an ounce a day again, that‚Äôd just be awful‚Äù. And like an idiot I listened.

It‚Äôs been 6 months since then. And all the things I feared came to pass. Two weeks ago I was visited by the purple peanut. I‚Äôd never been so terrified in my life. Blood on toilet paper is probably off putting for every human. To me it signaled the beginning of the end. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really fucked now‚Äù. I was away on work again. The first thing I did when I got home was grab what was left of my bag and prepared to dump it. But I couldn‚Äôt. It just sat by the toilet all night. When I woke up I dosed and cried. Food intake went to about zero. Drinking sludge and water with some diet soda is all that went in my body for about a week.

And last Sunday, that bag I couldn‚Äôt dump finally ran out. Without too much detail (I know I‚Äôve already given way too much), my new gf was over that night. And laying next to her I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to plan seeing her off in the morning then rushing for keys and flying to the store. And that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm at day 7.

None of that was probably interesting, I don‚Äôt expect much reaction. I just need to write down what kratom did and will do to my brain. How it‚Äôll make me a hypochondriac with a bleeding ass. How it‚Äôll completely take me over if I consider using it again, for any reason. That‚Äôs all, have a good day everyone.",10,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9990007281303406}"

It makes sense WD would be less if youre coming off a smaller amount, but if ive been like 60-80gpd for almost two years, will dropping down to 10gpd or less for a month and then jumping off make that large an impact on WD? 

I think im asking because I dont know if I'm just fucking myself over with this difficult taper process. Is the preserverence to stay on this longer and lower my dose the right move? Is the pain of quitting that much easier at a lower dose? Or is it like  - I'm going to be fucked no matter what I should just jump off and deal with it?

So today makes 21 days clean CT from about 1+ yr of up to about 25-30 gpd by the end. Seems with each week things get a little easier. I don't really have anything profound, or insightful to share but it just kinda feels like a good time to get out some thoughts. 

It's my birthday tomorrow and though i didn't really plan it this way, I feel like quitting kratom has been the best gift I could have ever given myself. My beautiful gf treated me to a amazing dinner Friday night to celebrate. Then, yesterday we had a birthday beach day with some friends. I may have had a few cocktails but no kratom, and more importantly no (k)ravings. And Today, my girl and I are leaving for our long overdue vacation. Woo hoo!

I say all this because I've had such an amazing weekend and I'm so excited for our vacation, yet I couldn't have imagined being able to enjoy these things without kratom just 3 short weeks ago. It's like we forget that the good things in life are good simply because they are, and not because of whatever substance we're taking to try to feel good. It's weird because I didn't even realize it until now, how kratom had robbed me of those feelings and experiences. Now I'm focusing on, and really enjoying the idea of just kinda being present, so I can experience the good, the bad, and the ugly, in the way those things are meant to be experienced. Maybe others can relate?

I let my guard down with kratom and I don't ever want to let it down again, with K or anything else for that matter. I know it's still a long road ahead so I'm not going to declare victory, but I am resolved to stay vigilant, stay strong, and stay quit. 

Anyways, that's about it other than lastly just wanting to express some gratitude. Today I'm Grateful for the past 3 weeks, even though they've been some of the hardest days. Grateful for my gf who has supported me in the fullest and without whom I never could have made it even this far, and perhaps most of all, I'm grateful for this sub and all of those on here fighting the good fight. Let's keep off this crap!!

Lol. It isn't. 
It really sucks I lost all of that story. It was long. And heartfelt. It described my many years of drug use, and how I got to where I am today. Years of sobriety and successfully defeating many addictions. Just to start again by fooling myself into think all natural supplements are fine. 
Lol. Man can I bullshit myself. 
I guess it doesn't really matter. I am here. And I am scared. Not even sure I'm ready. I have every excuse why not. Even though deep inside I know I have to. 
Not like I haven't been here before. A lifetime of drug abuse will teach us many things. But the insidious nature of addiction is always there. Just waiting to whisper another lie to yourself. 
For me, that started about 6 years ago. When kratom was my answer to getting off of the pills. Hell. If i was going to go through another month or so of withdrawal, I should have just went back to heroin. Lol. At least that's what I'm telling myself right now. Deep inside I know thats not true. Mostly.
Lol. Yeah like getting off pills actually happened either. They are just much harder to find, so kratom fills the gaps. Or actually, just took their place for the most part. 
Anyway. I am here reading all of your stories. Thankful I'm not alone. I guess we will see if I'm ready or not.

I was eating about 40 to 60gpd at my most for 2 years and 3 months. I never missed a day.  I tapered down  to about 2 to 3gpd over about 4 months and that worked for me only because I was so damn tired of my own bullshit excuses.  Every single day waking up needing kratom and constantly going through withdrawal but still continuing to eat all that powder because it becomes who you are and everything revolves around it.  I had acutes for about 6 to 7 days.  This surprised me quite a bit since I thought I had tapered to a lower amount.  It wasn't as bad as some of the stories I have read here.  I can't imagine being able to quit CT from my 40 to 60gpd habit so I totally know how hard this can be.  

For me, it was all about my mental approach.  Like I said earlier, I got so sick of feeling so shitty all the time that I was incredibly mentally ready to be done.  Kratom no longer got me to that feel good high and energy that I had in the beginning.  The larger the dose the more nauseous I became on a regular basis.  Then I transitioned to eating it just to not feel shitty.  I would eat a small amount for like a week and would start to feel great so I would take a higher dose again chasing that high and yet again I would get incredibly nauseous and have to lay down to even function.   I am naturally an introvert so staying home and laying in bed was very comforting.   Then covid hit and I definitely didn't have to go anywhere.

I started to feel really numb and dull.  I genuinely could not find any joy in anything I was doing and I jump out of planes for a living...  Music sucked, getting up to go anywhere for any reason was really tough.  All I wanted to do was lay back in bed and watch murder shows and smoke alot of pot.  Snapped on oxygen is my jam.

Anyway this is a bit longer than I expected but just wanted to share this for those of you struggling like I was.  Kratom is also a bitch because nobody understands what long term use can do to a person.  If someone tells me it is the same a quitting coffee then I dont even try to explain.   It is much harder than that.  Also because it is so readily available people don't believe you can get addicted as fuck to this shit.

At almost 1 month kratom free I am here to say it is very possible to get off this shit.  Is it hard?  Fuck yes.  Will you want to eat kratom to stop the withdrawal?  Fuck yes.   If you are finally done with your own bullshit and ready to make a change then I can tell you it is worth it.  You are worth it.  Most of the negative effects I was feeling all the way from my GI tract to my libido to my mental health is slowly coming back.  I feel mostly like my normal self again and kratom is quickly fading in to the very back of my thoughts and life seem beautiful again.  Take back your life...right fucking now and you will be the person you always were under that cloud of green dust.  Good luck to everybody struggling.

I fully realize now that I need two weeks completely sober. No drinking. It increases my anxiety and I relapsed this morning from being hungover. 

On the bright side, I feel better than I have in a while just on a weekly basis not being a slave to the leaf every damn day. I need to commit to being completely clean and finish taking my life back. I'm ready but I need to stand by my conviction. 

I'm currently in the process of moving out of my parents house an buying a sailboat to live on and I need to be sharp now more than ever if I want to make this dream a reality.

So last saturday I started dropping half again as much as I have been, .3 grams off per dose instead of .2 grams. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, so I started taking one less dose per day and spanning less doses out with more time in between to fit the same start and end dose of the day. This is where I started realizing that I really am just super sensitive to these dose drops. I haven't taken a consistent amount of kratom for more than 5 days straight in like 4 or 5 months.

But then I started to realize that at my current taper amount, I am taking less in an entire day than I used to take in one dose out of the day. WHOA. Furthermore, I never used to measure out my doses I would just eyeball it on the spoon, and I put together what I thought was about what my maximum dose I used to take on my most stressful days just to weigh it and see, and I found out that I am almost taking 1/10th of that now each dose. No wonder I feel so shitty!

So onto the milestone.. Actually there's two. First, I still have my bag of $130 worth or so of the kratom that I used to think was too strong for me and what started all of this unexpected taper mess to begin with. I've since realized that I would take my normal massive amount and have a bad time and freak out and cut way back (unmeasured of course smh) and then feel terrible and go back up and feel terrible and cut back. I realize now that I am just super sensitive to lower amounts, I withdrawal like crazy, so me thinking I was taking too much, I was actually feeling terrible because I had taken so little before it.. well regardless I don't plan on taking it from that bag again, my wife regulates the strains and the amounts I take of them from measured baggies. So I gave the bag away to my friend who has legitimate mechanic life back pain. Just gave away about $130 of kratom, and I felt nothing at all while doing it, no remorse, no longing to hang onto ""My strong strain bag."" I can handle letting my drug of choice that's near ruined my life and put me in the hospital once just lay around and not touch it, but to just give away $130 worth of my drugs and feel nothing? That's progress

But the big milestone for me was yesterday. I had my one on one with my addiction councelor, and it was a good talk for an hour on the phone, but towards the end of it I was feeling pretty terrible, super restless and itchy. I didn't know why, couldn't place it, but I thought well it's time for my bicycle ride, I always feel better after the ride. But this time I did NOT. I couldn't figure it out, and I was thinking what the hell is going on? That's when I realized that while I was on the phone, I FORGOT to take my 3:20pm dose. I just straight forgot! Didn't take a dose between 12:20pm and 6pm, that's a long ass time for me to not take kratom... And even more importantly I think, when I was feeling shitty, my first instinct wasn't to take kratom, or even to think about whether or not I forgot a dose, it was ""hop on the bicycle, that will make you feel better"" That's a progress for me that I cannot overstate, I haven't forgotten a dose in like 6 years. I feel super shitty because of it, but I finally feel like I am actually taking control of my life back away from this terrible plant!

Still a long way to go, but we're only I think 23 days away from getting down to zero with the taper, I am only taking 1.4 grams per dose now, which was an unheard of amount even when I first started taking the stuff years ago, and I feel terrible as can be, but I am a lot more positive about it than I was a month ago :)",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9982665777206421}"

I'm 20 years old, been a daily user since August of 2020, never more than 2.5g per day. I started noticing my hair was thinning in November and decided to taper down to 2g per day and then eventually in February I dropped that down to 1g. 

**About 10 days ago I just got really fed up with the whole thing and decided to jump off the taper, but my anxiety started acting up and I caved that night**‚Äîmaybe I didn't give myself enough time to adjust since the last decrease. Since then I've been holding at 0.5g per day and experiencing some weird symptoms with increasing frequency, and now they're present almost 24/7. Some of the symptoms aren't unexpected, like insomnia and cold/hot flashes, **but I also feel a strange pressure in the back and sides of my head like something is pressing on my brain from inside my skull.** I feel lethargic and it's hard to focus on things, and it's really setting off my anxiety. Taking kratom no longer reduces these symptoms and sometimes it even makes them worse.

I do plan on seeing a doctor, but I wanted to ask if anyone else has experienced something similar. I'm aware that I don't take nearly as much as some people do, but I tend to have a low tolerance for psychoactive substances in general. I have finals this week and to be honest I'm not sure I could complete them in my current state. My main question is: **If I want to reduce these symptoms, should I stop taking kratom altogether or keep taking 0.5gpd in the hopes my body will adjust?**

Some more context information:

* I vape, and I recently reduced the nicotine concentration in the juice that I use
* The pollen count is high where I live, and my allergies have been acting up significantly
* I've been making sure to stay well hydrated 
* When I tried to quit 10 days ago and failed, I (*stupidly*) switched brands and strains (gold to red)

Any input or advice would be immensely appreciated, thank you.

I started using Kratom in June. My usage went up and down throughout this period between 4-12 grams per day but starting in mid January I made a conscious effort to get off. I sttarted tapering with 3g each day and worked by way down from there. I jumped off at .5g per day last week and haven't taken any since. Throughout January until about 2 weeks ago I went through bouts of depression and anxiety but mitigated it with my lorazepam prescription and since I stopped kratom fully last week I've felt so much better

I've been taking supplements and .25 lorazepam as needed to thwart anxiety and acetomitophen as needed to deal with pretty mild aches. Otherwise, I feel fine - I can sleep (had issues for a while in the past) and feel much clearer. My memory still feels like its adjusting but overall I'm in much better spirits.

I feel quite depressed most of the time. I have a history of poly drug abuse (benzo, alcohol, weed, riralin, aderall, xtc, ketamine). Kratom helped me get rid of the poly abuse but the result was a just worse Kratom addiction.

Now that I quit Kratom for the third time I'm back to poly abuse. I took 100 mg valium today and the same dose exactly a week ago. I'm back to smoking weed and using alcohol daily. Used adderal today for the first time in months because I had to study but it ended up in a drug binge. I am a 'functional addict' for a long time now. I want to finish my bachlors (Bio-Farmaceutical sciences) in June. I need to pass 3 more courses before june to graduate. But I am in fear of losing myself. I have been using Kratom to study for approximately 2.5 years. So i became dependent on it for my learning. I can't go back to ritaln of dexamphetamine because it makes me depressed and in need for a downer like kratom, bezos, alcohol and weed. The other drugs are probably making wd even worse. I'm trying to find help via meetings and psychiatriscs and recovery talks but corona is making it harder and demand is high so I have to wait for treatment. 

My girlfriend cheated with a mate of mine half a year ago just when I had to study real hard. I took kratom to study and for the first few months it worked but I became a boring emotionless and eventually moody person as I became more and more dependent on kratom. Therefore, I need to quit.

I‚Äôve always been a big drinker but have gone CT a few times, or just didn‚Äôt drink for a few nights, or a just a glass of wine etc. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm physically dependent on booze, emotionally - hell yes. 
I found that I started taking kratom 3x a day. I would get a little testy if i skipped a dose but nothing crazy. I didn‚Äôt think it was addictive, I never even looked it up (I‚Äôm an idiot). I‚Äôve experimented with drugs and opiates in the past but like a half pill every few months. I‚Äôve never experienced WD before. Or dependency besides nicotine. 
I‚Äôve recently been going through a lot in my personal life. Breakup, toxic fling, Covid, reckoning with how much my parents fucked me up... and I started drinking way more than normal. 
I decided it was time to cut back on drinking, I had no plan to cut back on kratom because, again, I had no idea I was dependent!  Every time I would stop drinking I would up my kratom usage.
I joined an online therapy group and the doc asked about my drinking and kratom habits, I was completely honest, and he prescribed me 50mg naltrexone. I didn‚Äôt know what it would do so the first night I took a quarter. I had taken my regular 3x dosage of kratom for the day and thought ‚Äúokay, this is supposed to stop my alcohol cravings let‚Äôs give it a shot‚Äù

BIG MISTAKE. 

Within 10 minutes I was sweating, has insane anxiety couldn‚Äôt lie down, couldn‚Äôt stand up, pacing, restless leg (but my entire body) hot flashes, cold sweats, i felt like i wanted to punch a wall but I had no strength. I didn‚Äôt eat that day at all (heyyyy depression) but felt like I was going to puke, diarrhea... I spoke to a different, much better psychiatrist and he explained what was happening. 
I admit I‚Äôm an idiot for not researching kratom or naltrexone and just taking my asshole exes word that it was non habit forming. What the fuck. 
Now that I‚Äôm single for the first time in 5 years I had to call my mom who I wasn‚Äôt talking to at the time - because I literally thought I was dying and i needed someone there to watch me. I‚Äôve never experienced anything like it. 
The only thing that helped at all was .5mg klonopin and sitting in the shower for I don‚Äôt even know how long. 
Now I‚Äôm tapering off kratom and taking the tiniest bits of naltrexone at night. So tapering off kratom and tapering on naltrexone (as recommended by the good doctor). So far I‚Äôm doing better. It‚Äôs just a matter of writing out a schedule and sticking to it (for me). 

Also, a weird side effect is after I took the naltrexone that first time (the 25mg) I became unbearably aroused. I‚Äôm female and I‚Äôd never felt this before and i have a high sex drive. It was that feeling of having to sneeze but with orgasm. Orgasms are great and all but this was embarrassing and honestly unbearably annoying. Obviously when my mom came over I couldn‚Äôt do anything about it and just tried to sleep it off. I felt like a teenage boy or something. Has anyone else experienced this?  Apparently kratom coats some pleasure receptors and the naltrexone washes that all away at once so maybe I was numbing myself over the years? But I never had low desire so it was/is confusing.

Thanks for the support on here.  A friend and I who have had a several years-long kratom habit that as we're doing the math is probably 15ish grams a day.  We both have Naltrexone prescribed to help with cravings and as an extra motivator, knowing kratom won't work.  We are both very motivated, but we've tried to taper, etc. with no success so finally decided to just take Naltrexone and suffer through.  That, it turns out, was a questionable decision.  We both had super horrible withdrawal symptoms for days, like within 30 minutes of taking the pill we both were completely out for two days, and it's taken five to be at the point where we didn't spend 95% of the day in bed.  

Now that we're both feeling better though we're kind of in the danger zone - that is, we want to use Naltrexone regularly to help with cravings and as a good motivator to stay off, knowing Kratom won't be effective, but we are both super freaked out about going through what we went through when we took Naltrexone the first time.  We're trying to get on Naltrexone as soon as possible without the rapid withdrawal symptoms as a possibility again.  Most things we've found say five days is how long it takes to get out of your system so you can safely take Naltrexone, I found one that said 5-6 days and then the most discouraging says 7-10.  Right now we're planning on waiting 7 days to take Naltrexone again for maintenance quitting.

Anyone have experience or knowledge about this?  Anyone else take one Naltrexone the day after their regular habit, feel like they were dying for a couple days, then get back on it a little later?  If so, how long did you wait, etc?

I quit cold turkey after hitting rock bottom September 2020. I went through the horrible physical withdrawals and finally felt somewhat normal after a month. 

I have known about Kratom for a few years but never thought about taking it seriously because I didn't think it would do anything for me during my opiate addiction. However in December 2020 my friend mentioned how his coworker takes Kratom and immediately I wanted to try it. As an addict anything to numb myself is appealing. 

The next day I went to a smoke shop and bought it. I quickly realized I kind of felt a high by taking extremely high doses. Fast forward to now and I'm starting to realize this is no better than opiates. I feel like I am not present and Have developed stomach issues from so many capsules.

I get drug tested almost every week for court and since kratom is undetectable I've been getting away with feeling high. It makes me feel fraudulent because everyone thinks I'm sober but I'm really not. 

I spent hours on this forum tonight and I feel really motivated to get clean froM Kratom and live a healthy life again. 

I'm writing this post to not only join this community but to also hold myself accountable.

I have 3 months of taking very high doses daily and I am thinking of tapering mostly because I buy Kratom in bulk so have so much laying around smh.. otherwise I'd probably just go cold turkey to get it over with.

Anyone else experience fatigue and muscle aches at this length (Day 37)? Saw a doctor and all my bloodwork came back good. Even got a COVID antibody test which hasn't come back yet. Doctor had to research kratom, hadn't heard of it. Keep thinking kratom will become mainstream but hasn't happened yet. Although it definitely is getting close to mainstream in my opinion. Crazy thing about Denver is that mushrooms are decriminalized but kratom is illegal, maybe that says something about how serious of a drug k can be.  Anyone reading this thinking of using kratom for the first time, do not think this substance is ok to use everyday (or for some people at all). Alcohol, weed, and kratom are all drugs that if used everyday become a problem that you are oftentimes entirely blind to. I actually probably wouldn't even put kratom on the same level as alcohol, but the place where kratom truly caused problems for me was socially. Performed great in some areas of life (career,fitness), but kratom seemed to make me content with not getting out there socially and perhaps even romantically (have a GF but feel unsatisfied) . Even talking to people off kratom I'm nowhere near as awkward its hard to explain. Things just flow better. I think Kratom dulls your instincts and emotions in a way thats hard to quantify, it takes your edge off that usually gives you that extra oomph in life. This is esp true for users such as myself who would redose throughout the day, its almost certainly better to take 10g in the morning as opposed to 2.5 at 9, 2.5 at 1, 2.5 at 5, 2.5 at 9. With the redoses you brain doesnt have sober time and the WD is maybe more intense based off what I've heard/read. Even with the fatigue and muscle aches, its so satisfying feeling emotions again. Even anger and sadness, such important emotions for our growth.

I found not only did the kratom ease my physical pain , but it shut off my emotional responses to the mental pain
Well about a week ago I got sick , an for 3 days i laid on the couch , took 3x my normal amount of kratom to feel better. An come 3 days later i couldn't sleep before work
I realized it was no longer working for me mentally. The body high continued , but my mind was racing
As i type this the RLS which is more my upper body is going into full effect an it's quite unbearable. The depression set in days ago , all the pain of my brother's death finally weighing on me. Im new to this forum but reading all your posts has helped me. Helped me see I need , absolutely need to quit. I typically take 3 to 4 gs plus .25 gs of extremely potent extract in the morning plus double that at night to relax. In between I go all day at work without. I know my routine is rather weak / small compared to others but the withdrawls so far seem almost as bad.  
It's a challenge , I think I might have to go the taper route

I definitley want to thank this community as you are all amazing and so supportive and I attribute a big part of me getting clean to all of you here. 

The first week after I quit I was still having some acute symptoms. I had to go through a 4 day detox to quit as I was unsuccessful for 2 and a half years of trying to taper or CT at different times. I suffered from mainly akathesia, which if you haven't suffered from this it was one of the main reasons I couldn't quit myself. Essentially restless legs, awful restless legs, but throughout your entire body even during the day, if I didnt dose anyways. Would have driven me absolutley insane. That symptom alone was tougher than the H withdrawals I had. 

 Continuing on, the next 3 or so months i was doing very well and feeling so much better. Rose goggles you might say. Everyday wasnt the easiest and I went through a 2 week period of PAWS that wasn't as bad as thought it might be. Still felt more lethargic and anxious and whatnot, but manageable.

I foolishly made the mistake a monthish after my PAWS period where I did some coke, and I never got back to baseline after that. A little before that even my gut took a turn for the worse, and since has improved, but still shaky.  

I went in for some medication after my fatigue and depression weren't clearing up and I am now on lexapro, this is about my 3rd week and I am once again feeling much better. I am hopeful for my future, and all of you and your futures. Regardless of how you quit, beating this sludge is a huge accomplishment and I still try to revel in my victory.

Excercise really is the best thing, even though it's pretty awful while you're doing it.

Hence why I gave up my keys, I'm not to be trusted haha.
I got about 4 months totally clean at the end of 2019, and I felt fucking amazing. Probably the best time of my life in the decade or so since I've been using.
I started dating an awesome girl(we split up shortly after I started using again) I was in great shape, eating well, etc. Everything falls into place when I don't use.
Just trying to keep that in mind.
 Once I'm really clean, I feel better almost all the time, than I ever do while using kratom. 

Also, I found an app where you enter your daily dosage and your quit date and such, and it keeps a running tally of how much time you have clean, how much money you've saved, sends you notifications about your progress, etc.

- It gets expensive AF. Holy shit, seriously.
- It makes me sick if I stop (diarrhea, cold sweats, anxiety, depression, RLS, insomnia, fatigue, pain).
- It doesn't make me feel THAT good anymore.
- In fact, it's starting to make me feel a little sick too (nausea, dizziness, discomfort, itches, constipation).
- I'm almost always irritable and stressed (and therefore irritating and stressful to be around).
- It must be messing up my testosterone somehow, I have no libido to speak of, a lack of motivation in general.
- I have no appetite and barely eat anymore; I consequently lost a lot of weight, and I was already pretty skinny before, so it's not a great look (not to mention very unhealthy).
- I have an awesome, patient girlfriend who doesn't deserve all that shit.
- I have a roommate, who's an old friend, and a good friend, who doesn't deserve all that shit either.
- I'm not such a bad person, I don't think I deserve all that shit myself.
- My parents left this world a few years ago, and I can hear them spin in their urns over my situation when I listen carefully. They certainly don't deserve that shit. I'm a damn shame...

Like there is static everywhere. I know it's related to kratom because the symptoms increase right after a dose. Does anyone know if kratom causes any damage to the eye. Can it be related to the immunostimulant properties, or heavy metals found in the kratom?",9,{'immun': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9987951517105103}"

Theres no information online if this would even work,"So the Kratom physical withdrawal process for me lasts about 3-4.5 days and the withdrawal usually starts around 16-24 hours after the last dose. I was wondering if this would SPEED UP the entire process.

Let's say I go 24-36 hours after my last dose. I'm in withdrawal now and decide to shoot **Narcan nasal spray up my nose which RAPIDLY  kicks Kratom/opiates off my brain's receptors  which would essentially accelerate the WD process timeline but make it much more brutal to endure in the immediate short term. All of the withdrawal symptoms would hit like a locomotive, but would all end sooner (12-24 hours instead of 72-100 hours?)**

Would this work? Is there any risk of health complications (Increased BPM/blood pressure) going into precipitated withdrawal from Kratom in a violent fashion?

I tend to report when I double my milestones, the last time I posted was my 100 days.

in short: I was taking K from 2016 to 2020 on and off daily, had like 3 attempts to quit, the longest was 3 months. My daily dosage varied from 3 to 10 gpd, I was dosing couple times a day.

The positives first, I am myself , finally.

I enjoy my hobbies and dont need K to stay focused on things I always loved to do.

I regained my ability to get into ""flow"" state which was very hard for the first couple months after I quit.

&#x200B;

Few negatives,

I still get cravings, couple days ago I had RLS and usually when Im close to a milestone, I get paws.

I get depressed more often than before, but thats probably the price I have to pay for numbing my feelings for a prolonged period of time, but I believe it will get better with time.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

I dont regret I quit, I love being myself.

I still find it crazy that my perception of time was totally different on K . These 200 days felt like eternity. 

Stay strong and positive, you can do it.

2021-03-11 01:51:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/m2k11x/unsettling_feelings_everyday/,Unsettling feelings everyday,"Well I've decided to quit kratom and not because I woke up and decided to but because of an experience that I have never had. About 9 days ago on a Monday, a little after dinner I felt like I just got punched right in my heart. I began to feel faint, tingling throughout my entire body, pains in my chest than threw up my dinner. The next morning I threw up again and went to be covid tested. At this time I was not attributing this to kratom. The test read negative the following day so I tried to ease back into my normal routine. 

Frequently I would have about 2 cups of coffee, sometimes 3 along with about 8-10 grams of kratom spread throughout the day, starting with the lowest dose in the morning after my 1st cup of Joe. Thursday just as I was about to eat dinner I had just ordered from our favorite taco place, the pound in the chest along with the feeling came back. Did not throw up this time. I decided to go to the ER as I was incredibly freaked out by now. They performed an EKG and an xray and were not concerned. I decided I would stop taking kratom and caffeine that night. 

I followed up via a virtual doctors appointment and later had labs drawn which produced normal results. By this time the pain in my chest has been off and on and the soreness/tightness was constant without really any letup. Well today is  day 6 CT and again had that feeling again this morning. However this time my hands were tingling and feeling as if they were numbing. (Even now as I write this I have a slight numbness in my right pinky and ring finger.) The feeling freaked me out and decided to go to a more equipped ER.

Labs drawn, xray, EKG, the works, and all came back normal... Again. They even tested for troponin which was actually in a good range. At this point I've been told I may have a panic disorder, which mind you I have never had or been diagnosed with. I am in my head way too much and definitely have a doom and gloom sensation. I cant even keep my thoughts organized so if I am rambling this is likely why. Everyday I feel a sort of brain fog and will just get tired out of nowhere along with having to urinate very frequently after these episodes. 

I don't want to take kratom anymore and am very strong willed so I am not concerned I will cave and take more. I have not even had the thought of wanting more, in fact I am quite turned off of it now from everything that has happened. In my stash I have several kilos left and am giving them away. At this point I know I am rambling but this is somewhat therapeutic for me, even though I Never and I mean never write an email more than 1 or 2 paragraphs...

I'm not sure what I am looking for by posting this and do not blame anyone for not wanting to read this novel I just crapped out of my fingertips. This feeling of tingling in my arms, mainly hands, and sometimes in my face (like right now) just keeps me in my head freaking myself out. I guess I just am looking for anyone else who has had experiences like this during their journeys, what they did to overcome them and how long before I start seeing some normalcy in my life.

Tonight I finally asked him to tell me no if I ask him to bring some home and he happily agreed, which was difficult and relieving but also somewhat infuriating and I know he can't be talked into it now.

I'm not in as deep as some here and I am grateful for that, but my mind has been playing tricks on me about how often I am actually using kratom. I've actually only realized this from looking at my venmo history, but the past few months have been a repeating cycle of being off kratom for a week, then going on three or four day long benders. Dosing all day and ending up completely numbed out. I have been healing from trauma for the past year or so and I guess when I got back into kratom a few months ago it felt like an easy way to take a break and just not feel anything. Life is hard but at the end of the day I want to feel the full spectrum of human emotions.

I've been using it on and off for years, but reading the stories here are helping me see how it's been effecting me. I've probably been in a constant state of PAWs besides the times when I was actually using, since I don't think I've gone more than 30 days in quite a long time. I'm going to an ayahuasca retreat (my first time) in a few months and I know I need to be completely detoxed by then. Kratom helped me a lot with spirituality for awhile, until it took over and the only thing on my mind was my next dose. I'm high functioning (though if I kept going for much longer I don't believe I would be) so it is strange to admit this to myself.

But I know now that I'm done because I see now the full effect that this has had on my life. During the times I'm not using, I get a little glimpse of feeling, and being connected to people and nature again. I think it might get overwhelming because I never let that feeling stick around for too long before I go buy another bag.

I'm excited to start this new chapter and am grateful to have found this sub. If anyone needs a quitting buddy, let me know! This is going to be a year of healing for me and I'd love to share that journey with others. There is so much more to life than chasing the next high, one that isn't even good anymore. I was at the point that I've seen many talk of here, looking to solve any and all little problems with k. ""This would be so much better on kratom"" turned into my anthem for literally anything. Cleaning, working, watching TV, going on a hike, cooking. I always want it to be ""better."" I think I'm at the point now of wanting to fully realize that life hurts sometimes, and that I don't always have to ""fix"" that pain. I've had glimpses of this realization but it always quickly fell away right when I started taking spoonfuls again.

I'll probably post more often on the daily thread but I just wanted to share my story here. My life has been on pause for far too long and I'm excited to get it going again and am determined to start my business within the next few months. Let me know your kratom-free goals and what you want to accomplish this year, even if that is just getting off of K! That is a big accomplishment in itself.

I‚Äôve been lurking awhile for several months, and I finally decided to give up Kratom for good. I‚Äôve been using Kratom for around 4 years at around 50 GPD. About two years ago, I started experimenting with different ways to potentiate Kratom. I found a way to do it, ( I won‚Äôt share that here because I regret it) and I enjoyed the feeling. So much so that I did it up until two days ago when I decided to quit CT. Long story short, I started experiencing some medical problems, urinating excessively, muscle spasms/fluttering throughout my entire body, pain throughout my entire body, kidney pain, and insomnia. I‚Äôve had sleep problems for a long time, and Kratom exacerbated those problems more. Anyhow, I went and had some blood work done this past Monday, and my doctor called me about an hour after the tests and said that my muscle enzymes, and cholesterol are high. I go back Friday to repeat the tests, and i am hoping that I have not damaged my body /kidneys beyond repair. It scares the shit out me to think about how selfish I was all of those years abusing this shit. I haven‚Äôt done Kratom in over 48 hours.

I think it's so much easier than CT if you haven't got the time or don't care to have a sufferfest. My withdrawls have been very mild; the usual gastric inconvenience and a couple days up front of adhedonia, that's it.  For those of you who are wondering which route to take, I've done both. I don't think there is a right answer, but for me tapering was much less painless. I just made a commitment up front, before starting the taper that I was done with the shit, so really did not have any desire to start up again by increasing dosages.

2021-03-10 15:03:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/m270df/300_days_free/,300 days free,"301 days ago I took my last extract shot. For a year before that I told myself every day was going to be my last day. I was possessed by kratom. By the end of it, I really believed I would never be able to stop and would have to use it for the rest of my life to feel ‚Äúokay‚Äù. 

I almost can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs been 300 days. For those struggling - it is possible to get off kratom, stay off kratom and feel better than good about yourself and your life! 

Life is so much better without it - there‚Äôs honestly no comparison. I was constantly sick from not having k or the k itself making me sick - throwing up every day, feeling empty inside and desperately needing this nasty substance no matter how much I didn‚Äôt actually want to take it anymore. 

For me it was two weeks of hell and things only got better from there. Stick with it, never stop trying and you will get there!!! 

Please reach out to me if you need any support - I am more than happy to help in any way I can ‚ù§Ô∏è

I was using an average of 30-50 grams per day in mainly the extract form and that went on for about 2.5 years. From the research gathered, one extract bottle equals about 12 grams of powder. I was taking anywhere between 1-4 shots a day, usually on the higher side. 

I would have never been able to taper; if I had the kratom, I‚Äôd take it. But I did unintentionally taper in the sense that for about 1.5 months, at the very end of my run, I just kept relapsing every 3/4/7 days - so I‚Äôd go 4 days without and then take one shot. Make it another 5 days and take two shots. All that did was prolong my misery and keep me in withdrawals. Once I finally stopped, I started to feel like myself around two weeks. 

Things that helped me quit kratom successfully:

‚è∫ Getting honest with the people in my life 

‚è∫ Reaching out to people in this sub, relating, building relationships

‚è∫ Going to recovery meetings 

‚è∫ Exercise - I cannot stress how important exercising is in general and especially getting through the worst of it. 20 minutes a day. Lift weights; walk; jog; run; workout videos (there are literally millions out there) EXERCISE!!! 

‚è∫ Trying my best to be kind to myself - treating myself the way I would treat a best friend going through this

‚è∫ Cleaning my space; organizing; getting things in order - this can be huge for feeling at peace in your mind, body and soul

‚è∫ Once I was able to get the kratom out of my system (about two weeks clean) I put myself into a sober-living program that tested for kratom. I stayed there for 3 months; I knew if I wasn‚Äôt able to get off the kratom and pass a drug test to be able to stay at sober-living, I would have had to go to Rehab. I was out of options. Fortunately, by some miracle - I was able to stay off it long enough to test clean. 

Supplements I took:

‚è∫ Fluids! - water and tea; 8/9 cups a day - people underestimate how badly dehydration can make us feel

‚è∫ Vitamin C 

‚è∫ Activated charcoal 

‚è∫ Calcium D Glucarate 

‚è∫ Magnesium 

‚è∫ Vitamin D / the sun ‚òÄÔ∏è 

‚è∫ If I needed help sleeping I took Benadryl or melatonin 

I didn‚Äôt use any prescriptions/ meds to get off the heaviest, most vile form of kratom there is - those nasty ass extract shots. 

I fueled my body with vitamins and nutrients I knew it needed to heal and feel better. Not more substances that would further mess with the chemicals in my brain. I wanted to get myself back - the little kid who loved absolutely everything about life and living. The little kid who didn‚Äôt need a single substance to enjoy the hell out of everything.

I've had an on and off relationship with kratom for the last decade, but I've always been able to quit until now. I'm unsure of my exact dosage as I've been counting spoonfuls. For close to 4 years I'd take 4 in the morning, 4 after work, and 6 before bed. The weekends were a different story, I'd go hog wild all day. My second child's due date was on Feb 16 and I was afraid of dealing with w/d in the hospital with my wife (covid restrictions meant a patient could have one guest, and they had to stay with them the whole time...I didn't realize at the time the rules had changed, but even then it was snowing so much where I'm at that driving was its own risk). I began a very quick taper the evening of Feb 12th, and by the morning of the 16th I knew I wasn't going to the hospital without sneaking in some kratom. I felt so dirty. I continued with the taper all the way through yesterday. Yesterday I started with 2 spoons like normal, and only 1 after work and 1 before bed. I just decided to not take my morning dose today, and I'm coming up on my afternoon dose time. I feel like garbage but I don't want to take it anymore, so I'm thinking of just completely jumping today and not looking back. Withdrawals have felt pretty gross so far but not necessarily any worse than my initial taper. This forum has helped me so immensely, especially the dark time I had celebrating the birth of my son while dealing with everything that comes with the quit.

I have been reading this forum for a while and I can't express how grateful I am for all of you. This has given me the fuel I needed to begin my quitting journey.

I was a 50-60 gpd, 6 or so year user.  I began my tapper about 20 days ago and I am now down to 8.8 gpd.  At first I made a big jump down to about 15 gpd, and that first week SUCKED, but I needed to feel it in order to have something to push against (if that makes sense), and also just see what I was up against.  I am now doing 2.2 grams 4x a day.  

It is crazy how much I am realizing how much I have not felt in years.  Even down to feeling my hands and skin.  Here I thought it was just making me focused and taking away my anxiety and helping my depression .  I am now convinced that it has been creating my anxiety and depression by not allowing me to feel things in the moment.  

Yes I still have chills, sweats, RLS, runny nose, sneezing and all that stuff (all at manageable levels), but I am so grateful to feel again, that I am not turning back.

The level of support and community on this page is AMAZING!  I love all of you for being there for each other.  It truly is a beautiful thing!  Thank you all for helping me feel again.  I really appreciate it!

I didn't believe I was being numbed, but fuck once you are in the hole you don't even know that you are numb. only when you get out of the hole can you see how really numb you were. I only stopped because I went on vacation to a place where it isn't available (didn't plan on that). I took it as a  sign of help from a higher power. The first 3 days were ugly, all of the symptoms you find here. FUCK IT, POWER THROUGH IT AND REMIND YOURSELF IT IS ONLY TEMPORARY. I used to be a plant based eater, so I started drinking kale & fruit smoothies for the first 3-4 days and I ended up drinking like 3-4 per day.

""i feel like shit today, take kratom"" ""i feel good today, take kratom"". I think i enjoyed the anticipation of taking kratom more than actually taking it. Anyone who was a daily user for a long time knows the feeling. But the reality is, once you take it, it never lives up to the anticipation of how it will actually make you feel. This is the exact reason to quit. Your brain needs to produce it's own neurochemicals that will lift or lower your mood to whatever stimulus it is responding to. If you're blasting it with external chemicals (plant or lab) created it loses its ability to regulate a balanced and level baseline. My sleep is on/off/on/off since i've quit...but it was always kinda off even when using daily. I tell you what....the days i actually sleep properly tho, without taking a drug, i wake up feeling like a kid again. Properly rested and looking forward to the day ahead.

Work + COVID + the Winter Suck = me completely falling off the ""healthy lifestyle"" regiment and back onto the daily 30-60g Adderall in the morning, 35-45g of Kratom throughout the day, 8-12 cigarettes throughout the day every 1-1.5 hours, 3-6 cocktails when I return home to ""level out"", and then 0.25-1g of xanax + passion flower + melatonin to sleep. All that with ZERO exercise. Really no way to live, at least, sustainably (although I've done it on and off for years now).

I was self aware of what I was (and wasn't) doing this entire time, but I just didn't have the self-discipline to tell myself no and break the cycle. That was at least until this past Friday. Today is day 5 CT from Kratom, Cigs, Xanax, and day 3 from any Booze. I've hit the gym over the past 4 days straight and intend to go today.

The sleep and physical W/D's really sucked for the first 2-3 days - I got the entire list of symptoms. But starting day 4 everything was relatively mild. 

What I found interesting was going to bed last night at 11pm, quickly falling into a deep sleep and then experiencing vivid dreams where I was provoking a confrontation with someone and then out of nowhere an old friend from high school shows up and offers me a handful of painkillers, which my dream-self quickly ate. I woke up at 1:30am wide awake in a night sweat and didn't fall back asleep until 6am. 

I'm theorizing the brain is dopamine-starved from the rollercoaster of dopamine-releasing substances it's been on over the past 2-3 months. Hence the dreams are a way to trigger the craving...?

First and foremost, its true when they say you have to hit your rock bottom in order to truly move on. In my case, I honestly was pretty happy in my Kratom routine after 4 yrs. It took a while to get there. I had constipation for a couple yrs but after a 4 yr habit, my body finally found its new homeostasis and I was totally regular, only my shit was green. My morning routine was solid. I got up, got my shower and teeth brushed and all that shit. I even feed and let out my 2 dogs and quickly made my sons breakfast all prior to dosing! Was I in the beginning stages of WD through all that? Yeah, but I got used to it and I always knew relief was on the way. My sex drive definitely dipped but it was still there and I could perform when called upon. My hair never fell out or thinned. I avoided food which led to a serious drop in weight which I actually was happy about. Mind you, it wasn't always this way. It took 4 yrs to get to this new normal. Other then the cost and having to hide my use, i was generally as happy as I could be. It definitely made the lock downs bearable. 
But then it happened. It turned on me. I guess my 60 gpd plus extract finally led to my toxicity limit because out of nowhere, i started getting panic attacks after dosing to the likes of which I never experienced. I knew it was from the K, but i tried to deny it and power through for a couple weeks. It only got worse even when I dropped my dose. 
That was my rock bottom. I had nowhere to go, no way out other then to just quit. No taper. No break up sex. It was just goodbye. To be honest, I would never had the will power to do that if it wern't for my body and mind taking the wheel. Since I've quit, my hatred for that fucking plant increases daily. I have no urge to use again. That could change, cause im a addict. But my 10 days clean never would have happened without my rock bottom. For those of you that are finding the will to abstain the hardest part. Your not ready yet. I still encourage you to try though.

Myself and 2 buddies quit on the same day on Feb 1.  All CT (10-30 gpd - 2 years to 5 years of K).  Everyone is different, I lurked here for a while dreading what was to come reading posts.  We all said F it and just stopped.  Had the RLS, couldnt sleep, awful mood swings, etc etc.  Each with different symptoms to different degrees.  After 4-5 days everything became bearable (for all 3). The positives (emotions, music, smell, sex, etc) came back at that point and well outweighed the negatives.  Some peaks and valleys but i have to say within 3 weeks we all were great.  We all had in our head that it could last months and it really is what kept me from quitting. 

I really think this is the situation for many (if not most)  We all come from different backgrounds, different issues, but i dont think months of hell is the norm.  Lurking built up in my head it was going to be awful, and end of the day it was, just not for very long.  

My point is just to jump if you are on the fence, deal with shit for a week or so, and i think chances are its all up from there.

Are there any supplements that make it easier and lessen the withdrawal symptoms?

My main problem is the mental dependence I‚Äôve developed on the plant. It has been a crutch for whenever my mind encounters a problem. Upset tummy? Sip some kratom. Tired? Sip some kratom. Too energetic? Sip some kratom. Feeling sad? Sip some kratom. Need to concentrate? Sip some kratom. Etc. so does anyone have any advice on severing this mental dependency and bringing my life back to normal? 

I don‚Äôt hate the plant, it did get me through some of my darkest and saddest moments a few years ago, but I‚Äôm doing well in life now and I don‚Äôt think I need it, and it‚Äôs side effects anymore. 

I want to be able to feel my body again, and break the constant sedation the plant gives me. I want to get dopamine from life and not from a dependent plant. I feel it‚Äôs also harming my school performance since the sedation and constant dopamine makes me not care and not try as hard. I also want to save my money and stop having to spend $20-40 a week on this fucking plant.

I have abused heroin on and off for a decade. I got clean 5 years ago and then stupidly tried kratom a couple years ago. It didnt take long until I was taking kratom daily at large doses, blowing large amounts of money and riding a roller coaster of highs and lows.

I have been a daily user for probably 2 years or so.

I have gone without ita couple times and by day 2 i begin to feel a mild opiate withdrawal feeling. Chills, achy, running eyes and nose... some anxiety and irritable bowl. Not horrible though. I didnt wait around to see... started kratom again.

I have had my head buried in the kratom sands for so long I dont know what to expect.

So, I imagine kratom withdrawal to a relatively vanilla drug user might seem pretty damn awful.

Ive been through heroin and suboxone withdrawals a number of times. I know kratom withdrawal wont be fun. It will be so tempting to just take a bigger dose as my taper begins to feel uncomfortable.

What I fear most is PAWS and lethargy and anhedonia. I already struggle with depression.

I have some time i can take off soon and Im trying my best to taper, get it at least a little under control before I stop, but every time i manage to cut my dose in half and get it really low, the kratom tolerance lets up a little bit, and makes the drugs feel good again, chases me right back up to a high dosage. Zero self control. Did anyone find any methods of willpower to keep from getting high during the taper? A way to take maintenance amounts?

So I've posted a couple times here venting about what I've been going through.. So today I finally opened up to my family about my addiction.. This shitty cycle of heroin amd kratom. I've been doing heroin (snorting, not IV) and kratom on the days I take a break from the big H. Today I called a methadone clinic and made an appointment for monday. I'm on pretrial release so before I randomly get tested I need to get rid of this horrible cycle I've been putting my self through.. Been getting into benzos again too and I know I won't be around next year if I don't take control of my life and now I'm just resigning to the fact that I'm too weak to CT all this shit. Too much stress and depression, too many hours working and no free time to actually lock my self in my room for a momth to just CT. 
Has anybody here had experience with methadone?? What does it feel like and does it truely help to get off opiates in a comfortable way by slowly weaning off of this. I decided to do this because kratom (for me at least) has way too many side effects. Even my veins are getting stiff and I can move them around with my finger and that freaks me the fuck out. I feel like it's slowly killing me.. I already had a seizure last year I'm assuming from mixing kratom one night with phenibut adderall alcohol and weed (most stupid thing I've ever done) and I'm paying for that dearly because ever since that night I don't feel normal anymore. I have severe, and I mean SEVERE anhedonia since that night. Enough to make me suicidal. I'm hoping that methadone will finally open a door to regaining my happiness and to finally allow my brain to repair itself, if even possible. I just hope in the future I will be able to feel some pleasure in my life.

Cant sleep, take some  kratom, back hurts, take more kratom, runny nose, take some more kratom. Sick from taking kratom,  let's take some more fucking kratom. You have to wake up and be a functioning adult?  Oh fuck I need to take a whole shitload or kratom. It went on and on and on. 100 gpd enhanced for 5 years. It worked great, till it didnt. It became misery,  Then I was fucked.  I only had one choice, to get clean. So I did, was it easy? Well of course not, and I know its not over. But it also wasn't the hardest thing we will ever do by far. Its just a bump in the road.  Temporary discomfort, sometimes you just have to nut up and do whats right. Not whats easy. ( call me a prick, but im just being real) getting clean isnt all puppy dogs and fluffy white clouds. Ill help anyone,  shirt off my back type shit. But sometimes tough love is the best medicine. And acute w/d is exactly that time . Be tough with yourself,  get through this, give yourself no other option. The misery is a teacher and let the lesson burn into your very soul. Unless you want to go through this again. I sure in the fuck dont. 
 
Humans are programmed for adaptation, unfortunately a lot of us are also programmed for addiction. They are kind of the same though. We adapted to a substance. So now we must adapt to natural. When I say we, I am at the forefront. Ill gladly give you advice, but my sobriety has to take precedence. I hope you feel the same way in every aspect of your life. It's the only way to stay sober.  

Im still fighting immense brain fog and other mental symptoms. I feel like I can't fight them head on like acutes. The only easy way around it is another mind altering substance.

I havent posted here in a few months as I had kinda lost my will to quit. I have an extreme workload at the moment as I'm studying Avionics and working 36hrs a week, so quitting cold turkey is is out of the question for the time being. Thankfully I will be graduating at the end of this month so I will get it over with then. My past attempts to taper have also been unsuccessful until I discovered Agmatine Sulfate. From what I understand, it up-regulates dopamine levels which is opposite of kratom (correct me if I'm wrong). These past few days I have cut my intake from 24-30gpd all the way down to 15gpd without feeling any different. It also really helps with withdrawals because after I take it during my morning wd (20mins before my kratom), I notice a big difference in my energy levels and a lessening of the severity of my symptoms. I HIGHLY recommend this supplement to anyone quitting as it has been a gamechanger for me. Start off small with doses between 250mg-500mg, as there is a sweet spot you need to find. I hear it also helps a lot with PAWS and depression in general. It is one of the best and most versatile supplements I have ever heard of.

This is my third attempt at quitting, and so far it looks like it‚Äôs been successful. I went on a long 6 week taper from 15g/day (3 years) to about 2g/day, and am getting ready to ‚Äújump off‚Äù. 

At first, the withdrawals during the taper were largely mental (general feeling of depression and uneasiness, anxiety and otherwise a lack of motivation). Within about three weeks, my physical coordination and ability to focus were better. 

Getting from 7.5 to 5G/day was the hardest step of the taper. I went from three doses/day to 2/day, which made it much harder to sleep and had me in withdrawal for several days. Once my body adjusted, I noticed that the withdrawals oddly went from mental to physical. I felt great mentally, things felt and seemed much more real and my natural endorphins came back. Physically I still am achy and more fatigued. My body hasn‚Äôt exactly adjusted yet. I know this is largely the reverse of what most people experience, but I‚Äôve definitely been in more pain than I expected. Nonetheless, the pain is more manageable than crippling depression that I‚Äôve experienced the last two times I attempted to quit. I definitely feel much better today, overall, than I did before the taper. My head is clearer and I‚Äôm much more motivated than before. 

In any case, I‚Äôm near the very end of this taper. I‚Äôm now oddly at a point now where even a tiny 1 gram dose helps me get to sleep or keeps withdrawal away. Skipping it brings the withdrawals, restlessness, and uneasiness back. It seems that below 4 grams/day, tapering does very little to help, so I will probably jump off in the next couple of days to prevent prolonging any withdrawal. Anyone have any advice on how to manage the very end of a taper, and what I should expect long term?",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9937106370925903}"

Some great info here that was really helpful me in my quest to quit the green sludge. A little back story. I work for a small CBD brand called Pure Peace. We have a store in Maryland and a website that we sell mostly hemp derived products. In 2018 after talking to a LYING sales rep from a kratom company we decided to put kratom in the store. I started taking it the first week. At first it was great. After a year I started feeling VERY unhealthy and had pains that felt like it was my organs! Screw that. So in 2020 after reading on here a lot I tried a 6 week taper. I eas taking 20gs a day at the beginning. After the taper. The depression and anxiety rebounded hard and I started back on a low dose (at first) of kratom. I felt dejected. In October of last year we started selling a new to the market cannabinoid called Delta-8 THC or D8. Delta8 THC is a close cousin to Delta-9THC that is in marijuana.  It has less psycoactive effect and causes less anxiety. I dont like how I feel when I smoke weed but I really like the way D8 feels. It uplifts my mood without getting me so high that i feel stupid. Delta 8 is 100% legal due to the fact that it is hemp-derived per the 2018 farm bill. With that said. In November after delaying my doses for 8-12 hours on some days while taking a few D8 gummies I decided to do another taper. This time a little over 4 weeks.  It was a breeze with the D8. I was so surprised at how easy it was and how good I felt. And to this day after not taking Kratom for over 2 months I still feel great. I also try to eat healthy and exercise a few times per week. I think ut takes a holistic approach.  I still take D8. I vape it and eat gummies but not even every day. Im so glad to be not taking kratom. That stuff is a ball and chain. My boss stopped selling Kratom in early 2019 after some research and seeing first hand how addictive and unhealthy it is,11,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9465587139129639}"

After over 10 years of daily use around 20gpd, I started tapering on January 1st. I waited about a week in between each drop in dose, and my drops were 25-33% in the beginning, and then 1/2 teaspoon reductions (1.5G as I weigh them) when doses were under 6gpd. I always planned on not setting a quit date - I wanted to not know when I was taking my last dose. This unexpected last dose happened this past Friday night after 2 months of tapering. I just fell asleep saturday night before taking my measly 1g and haven‚Äôt taken any kratom since.

I have to say my experience over the past few days has been amazing. Very little symptoms. I have slept at least 4 hours every night so far, and when I can‚Äôt sleep I‚Äôm not thrashing or crawling, I just don‚Äôt feel tired. My stomach feels ok, my energy is fine. The largest issue I‚Äôm having is lack of motivation. I wanted to share this because I was so frightened to make the final leap, but I‚Äôm here to say that a slow taper absolutely can work! I‚Äôm honestly shocked about how close to normal I feel at the 4 day mark. I hope this gives some folks confidence in tapering. After over a decade of never missing a day, it truly feels special to go even just a few days so far without kratom.

Sometimes more if I was working a lot.  And I thought it was a godsend... until it wasn‚Äôt. It destroyed me more than my heroin addiction honestly.   I have never felt worst than in my addiction to kratom.. it‚Äôs evil. 

Anyways!! No more doom and gloom! I‚Äôm at day 5 and feel pretty great!! After about 2.5 hours of RLS( or RESTLESS WHOLE ENTIRE FUCKING BODY SYNDROME) I slept 5 hours last night!!! Which is better than the night before. 

The first 2 days were really rough. Zero sleep, the most unbearable anxiety, jumping out of my skin the entire time. Obsessing about kratom and how I wanted and needed some immediately. Even though I gave my wallet to my partner to hold for me. Scheming ways to go sneak off and get some. You know... dope fiend bullshit. 

But the night of day 2 as I was tossing and turning in my bed I just said to myself, ‚ÄúFUCK THIS, bring it on kratom.‚Äù And just fully and wholeheartedly surrendered to the process I swear it changed everything. I actually slept like 2 hours and woke up feeling a lot better. (Not good, but for sure not as awful.) 

This is possible!! I know for many it may feel like it‚Äôs not, but those are the lies that this devil drug is feeding u. YOU ARE STRONGER THAN THIS FUCKING PLANT. 

I got a bunch of help meds to get me through, most of them didn‚Äôt do shit for me (black seed oil, MELATONIN MAKES RLS EVEN WORST.) I even tried Xanax which I thought would help but it didn‚Äôt at all, almost made me feel worst honestly.

Gaba, 2 beers, and a scorching hot Epsom salt bath a few times a day. Getting off the couch and sweating( which can be so hard but force yourself)

Some background is that I‚Äôm a stay at home college student who happens to be taking no classes this quarter. I‚Äôm blessed that my parents can afford to pay most of my bills so combined with the fact I‚Äôm not taking classes this quarter, I‚Äôm essentially privileged enough to sit at home and do nothing.

I had about a 2 year kratom habit. During my peak in 2019 I was at around 36gpd and then during that summer I cut down to like 15gpd and then went back up to 20 and finally settled at around 12.5gpd in late 2020 up until early Feb 2021. Early Feb 2021 is when I quit cold turkey.

Here‚Äôs my experience that I believe to be atypical. The first 24 hours were pretty annoying. I really craved it and it was the only thing on my mind. I had that feeling of wanting to jump out of my own skin all over. 48-72 hours in was the peak. Cravings hit pretty hard and I was super jittery and just not capable of all that much. But it was manageable. Like idk how to describe it, yeah it sucked but it wasn‚Äôt the worst thing I‚Äôve experienced. After 72 hours I had the same withdrawals (cravings, jitters, crawling out of skin, ALWAYS cold) but it got less and less per day. By the end of the first week, all my withdrawals except being always cold and diarrhea were gone. By the end of the second week, my body could normally regulate its temperature and I was completely back to normal minus diarrhea. I‚Äôm about a month in now and tbh I still have diarrhea lmao but I‚Äôm back. Like I‚Äôm completely sober and don‚Äôt even think about kratom. I don‚Äôt really even count days or think about it. I also am having somewhat of an afterglow? My mental health is GREAT. Like I said, I‚Äôm a few days over a month in and I never really got PAWS. My withdrawals were all physical besides mental cravings and boredom. I guess not everyone gets PAWS or maybe it‚Äôs delayed for me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

My entire point is: I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm a rare occurrence but for me, quitting kratom wasn‚Äôt that bad. So for anyone on the fence who‚Äôs never quit before, maybe just give it a try and there‚Äôs a chance you might be like me where it‚Äôs very manageable. Absolutely the circumstances of my ability to just stay at home helped, I didn‚Äôt have to work or attend school. I‚Äôm not going to give myself the credit, I give my parents the credit for providing for me while I quit. 

One last thing to note is prior to kratom I was addicted to weed and nicotine. Weed was a little tough (I‚Äôd say tougher than kratom) but I managed to quit it cold turkey. Same with nicotine, I was a MAJOR vape addict for a year and went through almost 2 Juul pods a day. Quit cold turkey, wasn‚Äôt that bad.

If I can make it to pay day, no Kratom, I am buying the big lego Star Wars AT-AT walker and idc if my friends call me a fag for building it or if my gf makes fun of me. I hope that the withdrawals don‚Äôt take the happiness out of that.

2021-03-08 22:57:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/m0y70d/my_story_with_kratom/,My Story with Kratom,"My story with Kratom begins with my most recent surgery last year. I've had 10 kidney stone surgeries in my lifetime. From probably around 21-22 years old I've had 1-2 surgeries per year because of those damn things. Around my 8th or 9th surgery I got pretty addicted to pain medication because the doctor irresponsibly dispensed hundreds to me, pretty much at will. The withdrawal was excruciating. 

So, given that experience I was wary about getting back on pain medication after this last surgery, among other reasons. I have an addictive personality, primarily with opiates. I believe it runs in my family given my dad was addicted to Oxycodone throughout my childhood, as well as my mom, although heroin was her drug of choice. My mom eventually died from Heroin overdose in 2016. My sister was also addicted to heroin for many years. She is finally clean. For some reason, opiates just have some sort of grasp on us, and given my anecdotal experiences it seems to be a genetic one. Fortunately I've never tried heroin, and my only opiate addiction experience was with pain pills dispensed by my doctor due to kidney stone surgeries. 

Now, onto Kratom. After this last surgery I opted not to take pain medication and researched alternative options. This is how I discovered Kratom. So I found a local head shop that sold it, drove down and purchased a 90 count bottle of bumble bee premium kratom. I read that I needed to take 6 to feel the effects, so I did. Within 30 minutes the pain was gone and I felt great. Aside from the easement of pain, I felt mentally alert and overall just happy. As the weeks progressed 6 pills daily turned to 8, which turned to 16, which turned to 30 and so on. 1 year later, I found myself taking almost a full 90 count bottle within 1 or 2 days. I started buying larger bottles and packages, and gradually running through them just as fast, simply to chase the feeling I got from that very 1st dose. After some time I no longer needed them for pain, I just enjoyed taking them to play video games. 

I never once thought that I was addicted until a few weeks ago when I realized I haven't written a single article on Medium, a joke in my notepad (I used to do open mic at a comedy club), I hadn't uploaded to my youtube channel or put any work into any single productive side hobby I once pursued since I started taking Kratom. It effectively made me a lazy piece of shit, whose only interest was taking enormous amounts of Kratom and playing video games or watching YouTube.

 I wasted a year of my life being addicted to Kratom before coming to this realization a few weeks ago. I'm currently 2 days off Kratom and the withdrawals suck, although not near as bad as the withdrawal I had from the pain pills a few years ago. I just hate these cold chills.  I've been freezing all day long despite my house being a constant 70¬∞f. My sleeping schedule is fucked and I feel mentally slow. Hopefully this will subside soon.

I'd say days 2-4 were the worst, but not too hard. Very anxious, and it was hard to sleep. That's it. Then everyday just gets better and better.  I still toss and turn a little bit before bed. RLS is still there but definitely not as intense as it was week 1. And I find myself wanting to be lazy and not push myself, but of course this is easy to deal with.   


Now on to the good stuff. I wake up after about 6 hours of sleep fully rested. No more morning sickness and walking around dizzy. I actually feel hungry again and I don't have to force myself to eat. Also my poops are incredible lol. Had a few ghost wipes which hasn't happened in years. Music sounds amazing and I'm actually playing guitar again and learning new songs. I actually get excited for things like going on a hike, restuarant, or even just going to the grocery store. I've been motivated to eat healthier. I feel like I owe it to my body for putting it through this crap for years.  


I took kratom everyday for 3 years total, but I'd say 2 years were really good. The last year I was just taking it to feel normal, didn't get high at all. If you are at that point, its time to quit.

I thought it was going to be a nightmare, and kept waiting and waiting for the horrible withdrawals to kick in and they did not arrive :) Wasn't nearly as bad as I was expecting

Full disclosure I have been using Xanax occasionally to combat the anxiety (going to be eliminating that from my diet when I get fully off kratom), but other than that lots and lots of water and bike riding, magnesium and viatmin C. I was so surprised to not feel that much worse with a bigger drop that I decided to try my new plan to drop one of my 7 doses per day out and down to 6 doses per day, starting today, spreading the time in between doses out longer to one every 2 hours and 50 minutes instead of every 2 hours and 20 minutes. Which is a big deal for because it effectively is another taper drop and sooner than we usually do the drop.

But lately I have noticed I'm not dying for that next dose and glancing at the clock every minute around the 2 hour mark. I have been getting to my 2 hours and 20 minutes dose time and thinking ""ya know, I could probably go another half hour without a dose"" Today's the first time I actually did it! Small milestones lead to bigger ones!

Day's not over yet, and I'm not getting my hopes up too much, so jury's still out but honestly it hasn't been nearly as bad as I thought it would be.

2021-03-08 17:39:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/m0s64c/day_14_day_3_unassisted/,Day 14 (Day 3 unassisted),"So at the end of december I ran out, so through new years I spent 8 days only on loperimide and extremely weak poppy tea. I went from 24 pills every 3 hours (4 large bible paper parachutes), down to 6 every 3. When my bag arrived I stayed at 6 every 3 for a few weeks, then did a weak taper. I only lowered my tolerance down to 5 every 3 hours after a whole week tapering, so I got frustrated and held off on quitting until I ran out. Then I'd quit for good. That day came 2 weeks ago, now.

First off let me say my first mini kick back in december/january DID help a fuck ton. First it lowered my tolerance, but even after another month and a half of full on kratom abuse I had a lot of progress saved. When my final dose wore off on the 22nd, I found my withdrawals were shitty but nowhere near as bad as they were in January. Not even as bad as they were on the last day of my mini kick. So don't think you're losing progress if you have a slip up, every single day off kratom helps.

The first 3 days sucked ass. I found my minimum required dose of loperimide was 6 pills. I took 6 every day when I woke up for 3 days. Then when I woke up on day 4, I found I had decreased withdrawal. So I only took 4 and it worked. First day on 4 sucked nearly as bad as the first day quitting on 6, but considering the progress I made I was proud. I continued taking 4 pills every day for another 3 days, then on day 7 lowered to 2. I then got cocky and the very next day lowered down to 1 pill. I was surprised, it worked. So the next day on day 9 I lowered to half a pill. That worked, too! So the next day I tried a quarter pill. That also worked. On day 11 I tried half a quarter pill (literally something stupid like 0.25mg loperimide) and it didn't work, I couldn't sleep. So I just took a quarter pill and it worked.

So finally 3-ish days ago (My sleep schedule has migrated later), I took my last dose. I spent a whole day 100% unassisted and when it came time to sleep I slept as good as if I was on loperimide, which was to say I slept alright. I got 7 hours of sleep but woke up in minor discomfort (extremely mild restlessness, fever but no sweating no matter how hot I got) but once I was up, I felt the same as I did the day before. Definitely not worse, if anything I felt maybe 5% better. So I spent the next day sober and when it came time to go to bed I had some trouble sleeping but once I got to sleep I got 7 hours.

Now it's been 3 days completely unassisted. I haven't taken anything to assist. No magnesium, no other vitamins and no loperimide. I feel pretty damn good now. My depression today decreased, my depression hasn't been bad. It's just been a level of boredom and a lack of enthusiasm to occupy myself but today I found myself laughing at shit and even playing some games (I typically don't have the enthusiasm to game when in w/d) Right now I'd say my restless leg is at literally 0. Not even that lingering shadow of restless leg you sometimes get.

Fucking finally dude. Last time I actually followed through with a kick was when I kicked poppy tea in October, 2019 and even then I wasn't 100% sober. I got down to being able to sleep nearly unassisted but even then I'd take 1 pill of kratom a day just before bed. Now I don't need to take anything to get to sleep.

My favorite bit is not having to worry about eating food. When I was on kratom hard, I wouldn't eat except before bed so I could take high doses of kratom and have it hit in 30 to 60 minutes. The past week I've started eating frequently again. It feels odd being able to eat whenever I want again after having spent 6 months on 1 meal a day.

I was on a short time frame to quit and decided the best option was to do a really extreme rapid taper to CT since CT was absolutely impossible for me in the past - never made it past 24 hours. So I hit the grind hard and went from around 20-25 gpd to 2 on saturday in a two week span and now at CT and honestly, I don't feel great yet but I feel ok.

I‚Äôve been down to a very low dose for several weeks now (was at .75, 3x daily, now I‚Äôm at .6 3x daily) and have sporadically gotten flushed, a very uncomfortable, almost ‚Äúsunburn‚Äù like feeling on my face, ears, neck, and shoulders/upper back. 

I would love to hear from others who‚Äôve experienced the body temp. fluctuation because I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm feeling or if it‚Äôs something else. I haven‚Äôt broken out into sweats, at least not during the day. Sometimes in the morning I wake up feeling sweaty, likely because that‚Äôs when I‚Äôve gone the longest in between my tiny doses (usually 10-12 hours).",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9961748123168945}"

MOTIVATION,"Thank you, seriously, THANK YOU for this sub-Reddit thingy. It, and all of you, have been fundamental in my efforts to KICK Kratom out of my life‚Ä¶ For good this time‚Ä¶ Kratom free since February 20th, 2021‚Ä¶

Decided, after multiple failed attempts to taper down last year, that this past February would be my last time dancing with the green goddess controlling my every move. What truly got me over the mental hurdle, was the negative effects on MY HRV (Heart Rate Variable), that u/butternutinmysquaash posted about and many of you confirmed. Honestly, that‚Äôs the first time I really read anything on Reddit, and fortunately it connected me to all of you and the amazing success stories I continue to hear.

Buckle up, if you want, I am going to use this first post as my opportunity to offload some shit, write far too much, if I may. The crazy thing, and I want this to be perfectly clear, especially these days we all have our own unique challenges, turning to ANYTHING on a regular basis to bend the ‚Äúnorm‚Äù, smooth things out, and disconnect the way you ‚Äúcare‚Äù for yourself and others, is no friend of ours‚Ä¶ But we hold onto them, protect them, defend them, like a close friend or relationship‚Ä¶

I have very little to complain about, but in recent months finally realized I was feeling constantly unhappy, ALL THE TIME. I have a great, although stressful job. I have an amazing wife who I have been married to 10 years, this Fall. Have two incredible BOYS, 3.5 and 1. We are not in dire straits financially (respect to those who are struggling), but this past year especially has been hell, navigating all things Covid work/young family, while learning to be a Dad in very unique times, sheltering in place and new bubbles. No ‚Äúhow-to‚Äù for parenting or life, I realize now I was using Kratom in my attempts to power through exhaustion while trying to keep up with my kids, it was my ‚Äúneeded‚Äù boost of energy/clarity, all day every day.

With all that said, I have been on Kratom for \~5 years (short break a year in), and this past year found myself taking it x6 times a day, and building a >50 gpd habit‚Ä¶ I saw it as a harmless, herbal solution for what ailed me. What I didnt expect, but should have, is what it was actually doing to me and how disconnected to reality I had become because of it. Also became aware, how much I was spending a month, and it had become a ridiculous amount of $$.

I am and have always been a thrill seeker, chose the road less traveled in search of adventure, and was once a elite athlete; so pushing my mind, body, and spirit is what I trained for and enjoy. Its been built into my DNA from my early youth to push, suffer, and with anything, max out the experience to the best of my abilities, win.

That can be applied to goals, physical or mental, but also unfortunately spills into having a good time‚Ä¶ When I wanted to tie one on with friends (mostly alcohol), or by myself, I lose control and go to deep, like I am racing for a finish line‚Ä¶ ‚Äúwinning‚Äù‚Ä¶‚ÄúDon‚Äôt threaten me with a good time‚Äù would be my normal response, in the morning, hungover, while I try to navigate the potential damage of the prior night‚Äôs shenanigans, because I don‚Äôt pass out, I am mobile and active‚Ä¶ So I never really know what I will get into, or do, or say‚Ä¶Thankfully, although I have made a total ass of myself many MANY times (NOT PROUD OF THIS), my friends are amazing, understanding, and forgiving in most cases‚Ä¶

So, back to Kratom. It came into my life after a MAJOR streak of injuries. Shattered my right foot, almost lost it, and blew my leg out of whack (it totally atrophied), a year later my other foot gave way under recovery strain, regardless, I was on a incredible cocktail of Oxy, Hydrocodone, Gabapentin, and more‚Ä¶ I used Kratom, as a suggestion by a close friend, to kick my opioid habits. It GREATLY helped me do that. Little did I know then, was just trading addictive substances. Then my inner warrior spirit kicked in, ‚Äúhow far can I go with kratom before having a issue‚Äù, how enjoyable can this be, at which point I believe it took hold and I became addicted to it.

Backstory out of the way (thanks to those who stuck around), although the ups have come with the DOWNS, I am SO happy to be off Kratom. I tapered for 22 days, and as everyone else has confirmed, the withdrawn symptoms from this blended-plant although unique for everyone, SUCK, they SUCK BAD. Something I knew, having dealt with withdrawal before, still NEEDING to do it while balancing feeling like shit, when work is crazy, kids/family are crazy and priority, and Covid is still a very real thing we are all working through‚Ä¶ But, you still gotta do it. You CAN do it!

Tapering was hard, as my body adjusted to lower and lower doses while juggling life. I have heard and tried to understand all the ongoing and upcoming withdrawal symptoms, while I work through each of them as all of you have mentioned. Now off everything, I find myself looking for the fix to make my days more exciting, ‚Äúentertain‚Äù me when I should just be relaxing, seriously lacking motivation‚Ä¶ Struggling...

Its also hard just to break the routine of it all, years of repetitive motion, we all have daily routines, you may or may not realize the impact/joy just going to your Kratom stash brings, filling up your tumbler, and the entire process in and of itself is all you look forward to, as consuming it has just brought you back to normal.

For all those who have kicked the habit, and those who are in the same place as me, GREAT JOB, this is the right move. I know this is the right move, but at day 16 don‚Äôt ‚Äúfeel‚Äù that yet because the mental struggle is real, to get me physically able. So, am finding things that inspire me, we need to get out and enjoy the outdoors, continue to exercise and or get your blood moving on a regular basis.

Going back to HRV, I have been wearing a Whoop strap for almost a year, and their daily ‚Äústrain gauge‚Äù is my guiding north star. My HRV and RHR started improved IMMEDIATELY after I began tapering (\~mid 20 now mid 50‚Äôs HRV, high 50 now low 50‚Äôs RHR), which is honestly great considering my workout and daily load are similar to what they have been, but scary what I was ACTUALLY doing to my HEART. Again, that was my, NO FUCKING MORE, DONE moment. Expecting stats to continue to improve with time.

Last but not least, FEELINGs, CHILLS, TEARs, I can tell my body is coming back to me. Make the change. YOU are worth it‚Ä¶Long way to go.

So here I sit, wondering if I should even post this LONG brain dump now‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve never had truly terrible physical wd symptoms; it‚Äôs the horrible psychological anxiety that grips me. I need to do another taper.

I‚Äôve already bought theanine and black seed oil, although I don‚Äôt know what to do with the oil. They have sam-e at the natural food health store, but it‚Äôs really expensive. Does it really work? (I‚Äôve already read the sub info on supplements, but I still have questions.) And the tyrosine? How does that help? I have an Rx for gabapentin, which I‚Äôve stocked up on, and it‚Äôs the gabapentin that has helped me the most the other times I quit. Basically, I load up on it until I can sleep, and I‚Äôll sleep 18 out of 24 hours if I can. Oh, yeah, I also have a fizzy magnesium drink (it‚Äôs a powder and you add water). Finally, I drink lots of nighty night herbal teas.

Also, what‚Äôs this I‚Äôm reading about getting something from the local cannabis dispensary? Are people talking about CBD? It‚Äôs never done anything for me. Maybe I didn‚Äôt take enough. I haven‚Äôt smoked pot in 3 months. I especially can‚Äôt do it when I‚Äôm using kratom because it makes me too anxious about my addiction to kratom.

Sorry if this is too long and/or not following the rules. I‚Äôve mostly been lurking here for the past few months.

Also, what‚Äôs this I‚Äôm reading about seizures? I‚Äôve never heard of k causing that before. I guess I‚Äôm lucky because the worst side effect I‚Äôve ever had is some vomiting.

The scariest thing is that I don‚Äôt really know how heavy my usage is.

I've tried in the past, and I think the longest I've gone is a week without it a couple of times. The hardest thing for me has been doing it by myself. I was too embarrassed to let anyone know that I was having an issue with it, because who becomes dependent on some green bitter nasty ass plant that no one has heard of? 

I have been taking it for 3-4 years. My schedule when I started taking it was 4 grams on Wednesday night at 6pm, Sunday at 11am and 6pm. Before I even realized it, I started making excuses to take it. ""Oh I'm having someone over? I can take some."" ""I'm going out? I can take some."" Eventually it lead to me taking it in the mornings and evenings. I used to be 8 grams in the morning, and 16 grams at night. Now I have been 4 grams in the morning, and 8 grams at night. On my days off I get a little crazy with it and usually end up feeling nauseous and very anxious by the end of the day. 

So tonight I pulled the trigger, and told my girlfriend that I am quitting. Told her that I have been having panic attacks recently, and I think it is because of the kratom. My parents are splitting up and I have been using it as a crutch to not think about the whole situation. Tomorrow I am telling my work friends too so they can hopefully support me as well.

I told myself I‚Äôd keep taking it until it got banned, because I genuinely thought it was bound to happen in PA at that time. I used on and off from 2018-2020, and managed to quit in 2020 for a majority of the year. 

I started using kratom again in January, but this time at a more consistent rate, perhaps 3-4 days a week. I would take 8 400mg capsules 1-2 times a day, and I felt at ease and productive at my new job. Fast forward to February, I was in a rush to buy kratom and ended up stopping at a Sunoco. I asked if they sold kratom and the clerk point out coffee kratom shots. This is when things really started to get out of hand. The extract was potent and powerful. It felt like I had taken a recreational dose of Vicodin. I felt good, and that caused my use to really spiral out of control, because I‚Äôve been buying the stuff just about every day since. That‚Äôs a lot of $$$. 

Now I‚Äôm at a point where it doesn‚Äôt even do anything for me anymore. I literally don‚Äôt get a high, just relief from moderate WD symptoms. I‚Äôve wanted to quit this stuff for good for so long, and I‚Äôve really been having failed attempt after failed attempt over the past two weeks. I can do this. I know I can. I want a better way of life, and kratom is not compatible with that desire. I want to be able to reignite that happiness I had while sober, and I know I can. I want to have a sex drive again. I want to stop relying on something outside of myself to have a good day. I know I can do this. I will do this. Tomorrow is day 1. I‚Äôm going to make it my last day 1. I can handle the physical withdrawals, and I will have to learn to handle the mental side.

I had a pretty strong addiction to kratom, using at least 50 to 75gpd, and I used kratom for about 4 years, every day. It took over my whole life. I decided to quit shortly after splitting up with my wife, and right after Christmas. I rapid tapered over 6 days and jumped off 60 days ago.

Honestly, the fear of quitting was much worse than actually quitting. It's not fun, but shit, the discomfort doesn't last forever. After a few days the physical symptoms were gone. I didn't think I'd be affected by PAWS, and I was totally wrong. That shit hit me at week 3 and I was pretty emotional and depressed for about 3 weeks. But, I was able to rationalize that my depression and instability was due to PAWS and reminded myself that it would go away, and it did,

My best advice is to exercise as much as you can and to stay busy. Get your life in order. Organize your shit. Clean your house. Eat well. Part of getting through this is learning to treat yourself like you're worth it.

Around day 40 I really turned the corner. I feel much, much better these days. I'm actually happy and content with life, not numbed out of existence. I exercise 6 days a week and feel absolutely phenomenal.

Don't get intimidated by the horror stories on this sub. Yes, everyone's experience is different. Everyone has a different tolerance for discomfort. But really, it comes down to this: either you quit now or you don't quit; if you do quit, you WILL get through it. Literally everyone who has quit has gotten through it. And everyone that has quit, hasn't. Which group do you want to be in? This isn't impossible. 

I'll never go back to kratom. Recently I came down with a wicked cold (not covid), and I did consider kratom to make me feel better. But it's just not worth it. Sobriety, in the end, wins every time.

I've come off of a 40-60gpd habit after three years. I'm not completely off, as I can't afford, in any way to be so damn tired all the time. I take no more than 3 grams in a day now, and half of that is stem and vein.

I know that that had a lot to do with the following days being pretty good and easy, despite the fact that my life is a total shitshow in literally every aspect. Normally, while under intensive stress and pressure, I become paralyzed. It's incredibly hard to deal with; especially since I've never, ever been like that in my entire life. I've been through much worse, and that says a lot.

I'm not sure if it's in my head or not, but I feel like I'm actually able to contain mental things better without gulping down green sludge. Polar opposite of what I've been anticipating, and I don't quite understand it. I'm sure that getting off has a huge role in this, but I'm not sure how huge of a role it is. My life (ironically as could be) is much more tolerable. My emotions are more stable, even when I am not.

I have quit benzos, stimulants you name it but this I just couldn't shake. Every two months after quits I would break. Tried AA, meditation, ayahuasca + psychedelics, herbal supplements, no changes at all, CBT and nothing has done the trick. So I am making a fateful decision.

This is something I have mulled for the last 3 years but finally financial strain, 3 hour dosing schedules, fluctuations in quality, waiting for the post and inability to travel without bringing sack of powder have broken me. I avoided this therapy due to all the people who said ""dont do it"" over the sub reddits. And, for someone who is on their first quit - of course try other methods first. But this is not a game any more. This is debilitating.

Tomorrow I begin Suboxone maintenance therapy. I start this after finally starting therapy, particularily addictions therapy, and realizing that there is not a simple fix. I wish 3 years ago I would have listened to my gut, and not the posters guilting people with warnings (who I know mostly had the best of intentions at heart).

I am nervous, excited, pairing it with a great team and a support system in place. I'm not foolish enough to say this will be my last time, but I have definitely set myself up for success in ways i did not before.

Wish me luck, i take my last dose in approximately 4 hours. Kratom might seem mild to some, but for folks like me, ease of access makes it more tempting than street drugs. It was a convenient pocket tool me and my wallet are not going to miss. I can't wait to take something once a day, sleep through the night, be able to travel (post pandemic ha) visit friends for more than 3 hours without carrying around a sack and spoon in my pocket.

For those of you who aren't new to this and who's main problem is relapsing (I have relapsed over 20 times - not out of lack of will, but out of necessity to live and work, I am so downregulated by now it is the same as perscribing SSRI's to someone who has serotonin regulation issues as a rough comparison), visit a therapist and explore your options, it might be a little easier to get support than you think.

How many times have you ordered or bought the same kratom bag you did last time, only to have it not work or make you dizzy and sick? Nothing worse then recieving a kilo of shit that is absolutely worthless. I probably have 3 or 4 opened kilos plus other various bags that have been hanging around for years just because it was bunk. So not only are we pissing our $ away, much to the liking of an unscrupulous smoke shop owner, were literally gambling too. The disappointment of re upping on your stash only to find out its completely different taste, color, and potency then the last one is almost as bad as paws. I know for a fact that my vendor ran out of green maung da and just mixed what was left with some other bunk strain numerous times. He cant just say he is out because he knows he will lose customers. So whats left for him to do? Lie. Thats what. When you go back in to bitch, they always say, ""hey buddy, your tolerance is just to high. Try this gold extract. Its 3 times the price, but it will get you there."" Kratom is completely unregulated. It is the wild west. The people selling it make all the rules and they dont GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOU! The only way you would ever jump into that mess is if you were hopelessly addicted and utterly powerless over your own actions. Imagine if alcohol was unregulated? Maybe your getting a 5th of double malt, barrel aged scotch. Or maybe your getting some shit that some crazy asshole made in a bathtub. For all you know, he cut it with piss to save $. He could put any ABV on the bottle without a clue and suffer NO consequence for what it does to you. Never in a million years would we buy that. But here we are, buying what might be some dickheads ground up grass clippings just because the label says its premium GMD straight from the jungles of Asia and into your orange juice. I do feel bamboozled by the ""safe and natural"" bullshit line we were fed. But more then that, I hate the fact that i knew better and instead, tried to play the ignorant card because of the level of denial my addiction held. I can say for certain that I am losing more sleep then the piece of shit that sold the kratom to the other piece of shit thats pedaling it at my local dirty ass smoke shop. And i can also guarentee that neither give a rats ass about what it has done to me, my family, my finances, my professional life, my hairline and my libido. Before you tried kratom, if someone would have come up to you that you never met, and said ""hey boss, i got this ground up leaf imported directly from a 3rd world country. It tastes so bad you got to mix it with juice just to get it down, and theres a 50 50 chance you may puke it back up in an hr. And all you have to do is trade me cash and your sex life for it."" We would have laughed our asses off at him and maybe kicked him in the nuts. Yet here I am. Feeling the worst I've ever felt mentally and physically. Driving away my wife and child because im so pissed all the time, they are either too scared or annoyed to be around me. Another night flopping around on the couch because my wife doesn't even know me anymore. Frankly, its a blessing my dick barely works cause she wouldn't touch it with a 20ft long pole right now... fuck this god damn plant. Fuck the people who sell it.

If the world had a poster child for addiction and addictive personalities in people it would be me. After being in and out of treatment programs from 20-24 I finally took the big leap to quit drugs and alcohol for good. Went to an prestigious rehab center and got my life back together from drugs and alcohol. Well 5 months later, in an IOP group of all places, I learned about Kratom. Oh it‚Äôs for pain, energy and anxiety, I was ready to sign up. I handled it moderately well for the first year. Then more recently I‚Äôve started taking more and more, going to work high, vomiting from taking to much just the normal stuff when you find yourself addicted to something. So after a bad decision to take some gabapentin I missed going into work and my family and fianc√© decided I needed to quit. Well I started tapering with no good intentions to actually quit. Just sneak it more when I could. My fianc√© sat me down Monday and asked me what the plan was. I had zero plan. The only plan was to keep sneaking around and take what I wanted when I wanted. That brought me to the realization that I wanted Kratom more than I wanted him or my family. That was a very scary realization. I made the decision to go throw it in the dumpster and start the recovery period again. I‚Äôm on day 2, called into work because I didn‚Äôt know how to fake it through my job as a teacher, I‚Äôm freezing, I‚Äôm sad, and I really really wanting to go buy some.

(a rant ... a declaration)","In one month and one day I am starting school.A rigorous, competitive, emotionally challenging, intellectually challenging, AND physically challenging program. I refuse to continue with this kratom bullshit as I start this program.

Sigh.

I found myself in this subreddit back in April 2020. Damn near a year ago - the beginning of the pandemic. Everything was fucked. I was forced to stop working, forced to stay home, forced to confine within the walls of my home. Poor planning also forced me to QUICKLY taper my kratom *addiction* from abt. 20GPD down to 8GPD.  I realized I was running out of my supply and the store I get it from had to quickly switch from being open to delivery only. They couldn't make a delivery to me until a full 24 hours later. It was either take what I had and wing it, or ration what I had for the next 24 hours - which was about 8GPD. I thought, hey what a good time to actually taper and quit this shit! What better time than now, when I am not working, when I am at home - little responsibility...

I was doing well. I went down to about 3GPD by May.

Then...work was allowed to open again. I was busy at work, making up for 7 weeks of being gone. Getting home after 10, 12, even 14 hr days - exhausted and looking for relief. I thought, I can just take a little more than my ""allowed"" dose because I was so tired.

Lmao...we all know where that went... A little tonight, a little this morning, a little more in the afternoon ... a lot more tonight, a lot more this morning... FUCK.

Back to mother fucking square one.

We all know that game. Yet, we say that we won't allow ourselves to go back to where we once were - all while going back to where we once were. It's such a viscous game...

I am back up to about 15-20 GPD... But this time I wake up in WD, I snap awake and *feel* it. Then throughout the day, it's that same song and dance of needing more, taking more, rinse and repeat.  How, WHY, did I do this to myself? So stupid....

Cue that school thing I said earlier. I can't take this bullshit with me as I start school. I fucking can't! But, I am also the embodiment of a wuss, and can't fathom the thought of full WD. Especially when a month from now, I can't be mentally/emotionally consumed with whatever mental/physical WD I may still be experiencing.

I know what you're thinking... ""Just do it, just jump off and bite the bullet. You can do it!"" I don't have that kind of faith in myself.

My only viable option (as I see it) is to taper. Even if my taper is still in progress as I start school, IF I can maintain some level of ""normalcy"" as I begin the program, I will do it. But I can not continue that full day of taking kratom, wondering when I can take more, thinking about it at work, thinking about it as I go to bed...it's just too much.

Is it asinine of me to think that I can taper all the way down to the wee bits of nothing, and avoid an astronomical amount of discomfort while I do it?

Any whom, when I found myself here a year ago, I realized that I can't do this alone. I need the support, community, AND accountability that this subreddit offers. So here I am, *again*. I can handle discomfort, but I can not handle the world altering WDs that CT brings us. So, taper it is.   


Slow and steady, right?

2021-03-04 10:04:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/lxmhpk/over_it_a_novel/,OVER. IT. (A novel),"I‚Äôve been taking Kratom for the past year. Probably started at 5 gpd and then went up to anywhere to 40 gpd (but I don‚Äôt always take that much - it ebbs and flows). Funny enough, I started it at the same time I decided to stop my heavy nightly drinking (which I successfully did). I really think the drinking was killing me, so honestly Kratom had its trade-offs because it helped me do that. I was an alcoholic (I‚Äôm an attorney, so there you go). Unfortunately, my addictive personality coupled with lockdown traded one for the other. 

It has been fine until recently when I started noticing a few things. My hair seemed to be falling out more than usual. I NEVER wake up rested. And sometimes if I don‚Äôt dose at night I lay awake all night tossing and turning with restless legs until I break down and dose. I‚Äôm like... wtf. (That one is new and it‚Äôs the WORST.)

I‚Äôm a lawyer and a mom of elementary-aged kids (virtual schooling them and working remotely, all at home). So suffice it to say, trying to kick this habit that has provided calm energy for the past year has been a challenge. I used to take adderall daily for energy and motivation, but that exacerbated my drinking because it makes me super wired and edgy and weird. Kratom also helped me stop taking adderall every day. 

I think throughout my life I‚Äôve attempted to treat my depression/ADHD issues on my own. I finally started a low dose of Wellbutrin a few months ago and it seems to have had a marginal effect, but I go back and forth about taking it. I really just want to be a clean, sober, whole, present person. I think when I rely on these substances it makes the life I‚Äôve created bearable, but it doesn‚Äôt allow me to address the root of the problem. I sort of stay stuck on this hamster wheel. (And I think the problem for me is the rat race of modern life in general. But it‚Äôs hard to jump off the wheel when you are the sole provider of income and health insurance for your family.) When I‚Äôm not trapped in my house, listening to kids yell and getting a pings from my boss, I don‚Äôt really think about taking it.

I‚Äôve sort of half-heartedly stopped Kratom a few times, but I‚Äôm horrible at depriving myself of things. It‚Äôs a mind game with me. I have to be pushed to my limit, I guess. Fortunately, I‚Äôve never really hit a rock bottom. I seem to be able to reign it in before then. 

This past week I didn‚Äôt take as much Kratom because I was prescribed tramadol for a muscle strain. The difference in my body was really noticeable. My skin looked different, my mind wasn‚Äôt foggy, I could remember things, but most importantly, I didn‚Äôt wake up feeling like absolute shit. I mean, I can sleep 10-12 hours and still wake up groggy and exhausted when taking Kratom. It‚Äôs really hard to explain. When I was off of Kratom I was waking up before my alarm and sleeping through the night. It was really eye-opening. 

Last night I tossed and turned ALL night. My limbs couldn‚Äôt stop moving. That‚Äôs always my biggest withdrawal symptom with opiates - restless legs/limbs. I woke up feeling horrible. Normally I would t&w first thing to make my relentless work meetings bearable, but I honestly can‚Äôt bring myself to do it today... yet. But I‚Äôm already thinking about it. 

I‚Äôm so over this bullshit. I think half of the time the anhedonia does me in because I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúOh well, it‚Äôs probably not that bad. Life sucks right now anyway because of lockdown. Just take it now and get clean when life is easier.‚Äù I just don‚Äôt care. But honestly I‚Äôm so enraged about being awake all night that maybe I‚Äôm ready. I need a plan though. It‚Äôs so easy in the moment to make myself feel better. (I‚Äôm horrible at depriving myself of anything and always have been.) Then by night time I‚Äôm kicking myself and promising I‚Äôll do it the next day. 

This would be my first day 1 in about 8 months. I even took Kratom on the days when I was taking tramadol because I barely felt the tramadol at all (due to my Kratom use, I‚Äôm sure). I‚Äôve been reading through this thread for months and cheering everyone on. I guess I just don‚Äôt know how people do this long-term. But I have to remember I stopped drinking after drinking every day for 12 years so I can stop Kratom too. 

I have a number of things to help me if I need them - gabapentin, adderall, Xanax, muscle relaxers, cbd, thc. I know it‚Äôs like a pharmacy over here. I‚Äôm not really super interested in anything that doesn‚Äôt have an opiate effect. I‚Äôd be so grateful if anyone could share some thoughts about day one, how to stay motivated and how to utilize any of the aforementioned items if I need them. I also have an exercise bike I can jump on when I start feeling antsy

I really need to remember Kratom doesn‚Äôt even make me feel that great anymore. There is no more calm energy. It‚Äôs just sort of a dirty feeling. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt remember that until AFTER I take it. I‚Äôm going to write down the negatives for a start and refer to that list when I‚Äôm tempted.

This whole situation is so annoying. I feel like there are people in this world that naturally have energy and motivation without substances. I just want to feel like that, but no matter what I‚Äôve done in the past, I never do. That‚Äôs really the issue.

The whole reason I did this taper (obviously) was to mitigate WD symptoms, and especially mitigate PAWS. Should I just stick with the program through Sunday and jump off at 0.5g? I guess I'm just really eager to put this crap behind me. Also, my WD symptoms have been very mild throughout the taper. Very minor achiness, minor sleep issues, slightly elevated anxiety, but by and large I've been fully functional and feeling great. I'm hoping that's a promising sign long term.

Nothing too terrible. I ate dinner on the later side and I think that because of that my last dose didn't really absorb too well. I had some RLS when starting to sleep. I did fall asleep after reading for about 30 min and slept for about 5.5 hours. I fell back asleep for another 1.5. I didn't expect that at all, as I only slept 3-4 when I did my first big cut last week. That cut was a lot larger though. This morning, I feel both amazing and blah at the same time (if that makes any sense). Amazing because I slept good, have energy and I can feel all these positive emotions massive doses of kratom had blocked out over the last several months. Blah because I have some aches/pains and minor RLS. The aches could honestly be from a long bike ride I took yesterday vs withdrawal. I'm also not taking my first dose when I wake up. I want to feel some of the discomfort. I'm going 11-12 hours now between my evening and morning doses and it's not too bad at all.

It feels exactly like when you stay in bed all day sick or hung over and eventually you get stiff and sore. I have spent quite a bit of time in a recliner but I've also taken two 3-5 mile walks every day for the past couple weeks. Not sure if its pain I had prior and didn't notice cause Kratom covered it up, or if its new and caused from a lack of activity im used to. Either way, pop some Ibuprofen and just deal!

Like every time I try to stop I'll look at this time like ""it will be my last"". This time is different though, as I have been more open about when I have my cravings to those who are there for me like my Wife (it needs to be known, when these feelings occur). I get a little reserved to say I'm a Kratom Addict at times though, and we all know why!

I was a little confident about how I was to deal with cravings, probably because I didn't have something like friends to associate it with or didn't have a desire to use it recreationally like I did for other drugs and fun, and that thinking almost tripped me up.

Doing CT is rough cause it makes thinking straight hard as hell, so make sure to tell everyone who will help. I know that even those who may have no other pain relieving alternative, for a bunch of us out there in the world Kratom Addiction is real, and it puts up a fight. This is usually the time where things settle down, and I get a bad thought and start again. I would usually hide it wherever I worked, like in my lockers, dose according to my social and work life. So far though, there will be no more deprivation of myself to my beautiful Family who deserves me at my best.

Same usual story, was full of energy, no anxiety etc, no Gastritis and now I have it all and I tell myself K is helping when it's obvious it's what caused all this. I've quit cigarettes and alcohol with no real problems or WD about 4 years ago, I like to think of myself as pretty strong minded, but then I remind myself that I let K consume my life.

I wanted to quit initially about 4 months ago when my stomach started to hurt, went to the hospital, I was so far backed up that my constipation was starting to put pressure on my upper organs and even caused chest pain, I literally shit every day, although a little bit, and had no idea that it was even building up inside me. Dr gave me a huge bottle of Magnesium citrate and a cup of Milk of Magnesia at the hospital and told me to rush home and be ready in about 30 minutes, well 2 days later and I still hadn't shit. That's when I realized ok something is fucked up lol.  so to help my stomach issues, I made a switch to a tea, started to boil it and consumed only filtered tea, no powder, and then taper and added laxatives. I literally lost 15 lbs in a week ALL in my stomach. disgusting. I felt better with the tea, but made the excuse that now I'm not consuming the powder, so I don't need to taper because I'm probably not getting all the alkaloids. I was still taking about 30gpd and it hit just as hard as the powder.

fast forward a little.

I am now starting a 6 month course of Diflucan (Fluconazole) for Valley Fever, A pretty rare fungal infection you get just from breathing in dirt accidentally on dusty/windy days, in some parts of the world this dirt contains fungal spores that attack the lungs and if untreated, can spread to the bones, liver, & brain, I have had this prescription once before 8 years ago and I only took it 3 days and it felt very rough on the body, I can't imagine 6 months of it.

I decided to stop the K CT 4 days ago, the day I started the meds, because I can't find enough people that have taken diflucan and k together so I am very worried to mix them.  so now I'm dealing with some shit, I am having chest/heart flutters at night as well as terrible leg spasms, I've heard it's common with K withdrawal but also, it's a rare side effect of the meds and you are supposed to call the Dr right away if you have them. lol. oh boy, do I assume it's from the K? think I should call the Dr and tell him it's the diflucan? anyways, some of the common K withdrawal symptoms are rare symptoms of the meds and I'm not sure what to do.. you think going CT off K and starting the meds is too much on the body? Should I just say fuck it and take Kratom a few times a day and chance the mix to see if it goes away? My Dr has no idea about my kratom usage btw. Other than a painful back, leg spasms and heart flutters, I'm doing great mentally. btw, I get some Gabapentin here in about 30 minutes and the Dr said it was ok to mix the Diflucan and Gabapentin together so I'll be throwing that in to help with the K withdrawals.

So I was at 30gpd all hours of the day, like every 2 hours or so, and my withdrawals were absolutely HORRIBLE between doses. I literally couldn‚Äôt make it more than 3 hours without. Since then ive tapered down to 5gpd or less. And I‚Äôve found something encouraging: the withdrawals get SO much easier once you get down to 5gpd. Like I was really concerned but withdrawals have gotten easier and easier the lower I‚Äôve dropped. I go close to 12 hours every night without (whereas I used to have to dose in the middle of the night), and can go way longer without a dose. I just went 5 hours without during work and normally I‚Äôd be dying and shitting my brains out. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I still feel shitty, but the withdrawals are nowhere near as severe. I‚Äôm already starting to feel free again. Like not getting super stressed or anxious about how I‚Äôm gonna sneak my next dose in.

I‚Äôd been tapering off of Kratom for many months leading up to a medical procedure I had done last Tuesday. I couldn‚Äôt quite get all the way off in time but I was all the way down to 1.5g doses either 3 or 2 times a day. This was down from a peak of 18, maybe more g‚Äôa per dose for over a year. Total daily use was over two years straight. Reading this sub has helped my taper a lot, so thanks to everyone. 

So last week I had a complication with my surgery that forced me to be hospitalized, which I still am. It was extremely painful and I was on high levels of Dilaudid and tons of other stuff at the start. I was in so much that I barely noticed I have finally been on Kratom for 9 days. However, I‚Äôm worried about how being on Dilaudid has curbed those withdrawals and am worried all I‚Äôve done is risen my opioid tolerance and am in for hell when I get home and am off everything. 

I know this is a pretty weird and rare situation, but looking for any insight or anything from a sub that has helped me. Thanks.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.990426778793335}"

2021-03-03 00:56:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/lwmnu1/checked_myself_into_a_mental_hospital/,Checked Myself into a Mental Hospital,"Hello all,

(I am currently writing this Day 10 CT)

I was taking kratom for about a year and a half, on and off for the first 6 months, but then it escalated to everyday, several times a day, up to 7 tbsps (sometimes more) a day. I realized that all my life I had been using substances to cope with anxiety and stress. Self-medicating and never talking to a doctor or psychiatrist or therapist or anything like that for any mental problems. I have always internalized my problems and self-medicated. 

Well, as you can imagine, kratom, or anything else I used in the past, did not cure my problems, it actually made them worse. I spiraled into a depression because I soon realized I was addicted to kratom. I needed to take it everyday just to feel normal. That‚Äôs when I knew I had to stop. I had been getting it shipped to my house every couple weeks, until a delay in shipment caused me to go through unplanned withdrawals. I had 3 panic attacks just in the first day. The only thing that got me through was CBD oil and muscle relaxants that I found(again, self-medicating with the muscle relaxants. It‚Äôs a bad idea). I decided it was time. Even though I could go through the agonizing withdrawals and wait for the next shipment of kratom to keep me from being sick, I realized it was time. I didn‚Äôt want to be addicted to this substance every day. I didn‚Äôt want to have to hide it from loved ones. I felt ashamed and hated myself for it. 

The next day I came clean to my mom and my boyfriend. Both were 100% supportive and helped me. I am incredibly thankful for the people that I have in my life. I am surrounded by an incredible support system, family and friends. My mom helped me call some mental health hospitals near me. I told them I needed help getting through the withdrawals. So what they do with substance abusers is they keep you there for 3-7 days (depending how bad it is) and give you meds, counseling, and treatment to help you get off any substance and stay off. I was denied a bed for the night for 3 days (not enough room). I had to go through the worst of the withdrawals on my own. Then finally, I was accepted to stay there for a couple days.  It‚Äôs basically a psych ward. My roommate was with withdrawing off of heroin. I was surrounded by alcoholics and people from all walks of life with all kinds of mental problems, mostly addiction. 

Before I went there I was having such anxiety about going to a place like that. I had never sought help for my mental health ever in my entire life (I‚Äôm 23 and female). And I‚Äôve gone through losing my dad to cancer a couple years ago, and all sorts of other deaths/problems. Believe me...I am so incredibly thankful I went there. They helped with all the remaining withdrawals. They are now able to treat my underlying depression and anxiety. I am telling you all, please go get help. I mostly felt ashamed and embarrassed for being addicted but once I came clean I realized I was getting the help I needed that I put off for too long. Don‚Äôt wait. Don‚Äôt wait until your addiction and depression gets really bad. Also don‚Äôt be afraid to seek help. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve had substance abuse issues my whole life. I can now actually feel things and get high on life. You‚Äôll realize once you quit kratom the clouds in your brain will go away and you‚Äôll be able to actually feel again. And go to a psychiatrist if you need help with withdrawals. Don‚Äôt be scared. Much love. We are all on the road to recovery together ‚ù§Ô∏è",35,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9766026735305786}"

Needless to say around the middle of my shift I had my first ever full-blown anxiety attack of this CT attempt, I haven't cried in maybe two years and I was so uncomfortable that I started balling, this was highly embarrassing but luckily only one of my friends saw it. I'm on Magnesium, a tad bit of CBD, and Ashwagandha. All of them slightly alleviated my anxiety but it still crept up throughout the day. My whole body is sore, my thinking is foggy and I have no clue how I made it through work. Hoping to get sleep tonight but we will see, I have liquid melatonin to hopefully get me knocked out for a couple of hours but there is no telling. I also have some muscle relaxers and Alprazolam leftover from last year that I haven't really touched. I was wondering if any of those would be safe to take when the next anxiety attack creeps up (if it does). Just was hoping one of you had any decent success with these two meds helping for anxiety or sleep during the PAWS phase. Really hoping tomorrow can be better, luckily I'm only working half a day and then used vacation time to have the next 5 days off to try and tame this awful situation.

I'd always give my pets what they were prescribed, but my addict self would always put some aside for my selfish self.

Been walking a lot but its cold as hell in MI. That definitely adds to the suffering. But im okay with that. Im fucking done.,6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9265233278274536}"

I never realised i was becoming an addict. Since half a year I have been using around 20 grams a day. I was working on my bachlor thesis and i got dumped by my gf of 4 years when it became a daily routine. So I have been using 20 grams a day for a few months now and I thought I was functioning well on in, but I was becoming a zombie. I really want to quit now and I was on day 10 aften going cold turkey. I experienced some withdrawal effects in the first 6 days but that was not the hardest period for me I knew it was because of the kratom withdrawl. But the last three days I was so super depressed and lethargic. So today after crying for an hour I fucking took it again.  10 grams at once and I feel amazing and social. But I hate the fact that I can't shake the habit.

 I am wondering if I wil have withdrawal effect again tomorrow after using it once again. I am working out, eating healthy, cold showers like wim hof and meditation stuff to ease my depressive thoughts but it does not work. Does anyone have any other suggestions for coping with depression? Maybe a supplement or a breathing technique or whatever. 

I used to be a poly drug addict but since half a year I quit everything except for kratom. So I'm also worried I will relapse doing benzodiazepines again.

I would greatly appreciate any help or response from this lovely community. Tomorow I'm going to quit kratom again and now it will work!

Now for the last like 4 days I have felt zapped of energy, feel sick almost with like a cold. Muscles sore, sore throat, congestion. I got a covid test it's not that.

Courtesy of COVID, my use has increased, and half my hair is gone. I began to use kratom 3 years ago for back and knee pain. As a former benzo addict who got clean after a 1.5 year taper, I rationalized my increasing kratom addiction by telling myself that if I could successfully taper off Klonopin, kratom would be a cakewalk. I also knew that kratom handled my residual general and social anxiety like a champ.

At 56, I'm concerned about preserving my cognitive function as well as my hair. I'm female. Pretty sure it took a big hit with and following a 25 year benzo addiction, and my father, a computer scientist, died from complications of dementia. It was ugly.

I use teaspoons to dose, as I am thoroughly electronically inept and did not understand how to calibrate the little scale I bought at the head shop. I was up to 6 to 8 sometimes heaping teaspoons a day. Unsure how that might translate to grams. In my head, I imagine that 1 flat tsp= 2.5 grams.

So, I guess my usage is at 20 gpd, maybe more. But here's the weird thing: I couldn't sleep last night, and had creeping RLS, so I dosed 1 tsp at 1:45 am. It's now nearly 24 hours later, and I feel as fine as I'm gonna get. No anxiety or dread. Took theanine with caffeine, half my prescribed generic Ritalin (10 mgs) and am procrastinating dying my increasingly grey hair.

I have inattentive ADD, and am scattered af, so record keeping is hard. I know I need to do it, though. My rough plan is to hold off dosing until I experience distress; then, as bedtime approaches, hold off again until RLS sets in, and dose around 3/4 tsp. I do have XR gabapentin and guanfacine, as well as phenibut in the far rear of the pantry. 

If I don't sleep, work is a shitshow. My internal censor goes down, and I say stuff that I should not.

I'm on leave rn; go back in 2 days. Work is super stressful, and I find myself dosing there 3x/ 1 tsp, then another after I get off. I'm trying to reframe my ""need"" to dose, but pain gets in the way. I stand all day, and must walk about a mile on concrete.

TL;DR: Accidentally heavy, older user needs to taper, but pain, insomnia and RLS are huge impediments to doing so. I suspect I'm gonna have to bite the bullet, take another leave, and suffer insomnia for a week, but need to know if tinkering with my dose schedule to taking my biggest dose at night will help me in my quest to finally get off this expensive stuff.",3,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9987452030181885}"

I'm currently kicking 15-20GPD of Kratom, and I actually *cannot believe* how effective clonidine is for withdrawal symptoms. I'm 48 hours into this, and typically shit would be quite bad by now. I've been taking 0.15mg of clonidine once in the morning, and once in late afternoon, and aside from feeling a little lightheaded earlier due to low BP, I've had no side effects at all.

In terms of positive effects: No restlessness, no hot sweats, no anxiety, etc. Unbelievable. You'll still have cravings, lethargy, and depression, but you can expect 90% of the other symptoms to go away. Shit - I'm not even taking time off work. Perfect for someone who's currently working remotely and doesn't need to do physical work for a week or two.

The best part is that clonidine doesn't really run a risk of causing dependence. I'm sure if you took it for a month or more it'd be better to wean off, but a week or so won't hurt at all.

I cannot recommend this stuff enough. I also have lyrica, but I don't even need it. Saving it for if/when sleeping becomes a major issue.

So I quit kratom last year back in late November and I had one relapse that lasted no longer than a week in early January of last year.  I was an opiate addict for 15 years before getting into Kratom.  I took heroin, oxy, fent and everything in between and was on and off of suboxone and methadone since I was 18 (I'm 28 now).  Opiates always severely fucked with my stomach.  A fucked up stomach was always the most intense withdrawal symptom I had and always the last to go away.  Kratom withdrawal was the same, only its now been almost 5 months of not being physically dependent and I'm still experiencing stomach pain, nausea, gas, lessened appetite and the runs.  This was a huge reason why I relapsed on Kratom last January.  I made a post here months ago about this just to see if anyone else was struggling with this and apparently this is more common than I thought.  For anyone who successfully got through this, how did you manage your symptoms and how long did it take to go away?  At this point, the only real cravings I have are from wanting a break from the pain and discomfort.  I honestly don't want to use any kind of opiate anymore, but I don't know how much more of this I can take.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9980599284172058}"

I was prescribed Adderal 40mg daily about 2 years ago, started taking Kratom about 2 years ago as well but things progressed to the point where it's ruining my life after an injury where I started taking it very frequently to help with the pain.  I got up to 1.7ishgpd(enhanced) + extract every 4 hours of the day.  I'm trying to quit both Addy and Kratom at the same time but have been tapering both.  The taper has been hard but doable for the most part minus 1 huge part.  SLEEP.  I can't freaking get enough sleep to function as a human being and it's making this 100x harder.  I'm currently down to 20mg addy per day and 1mg K 2 times per day with a larger 1.4 dose before bed.  I've tried making my night dose smaller, tried pushing through the 3-4am wake up dose that is still happening and nothing seems to help.  I would just jump off both but I've read that sleep gets even worse when you jump and I'm worried that my staff/family is going to lose confidence in me and I will do permanent damage to my company.  My wife knows I'm coming off of the adderal and I've used that as the main excuse for why I've been acting so out of it.  She does not know about the Kratom and unless I can't do this I do not think it would be beneficial to share that.  I have told a few close friends so that someone is holding me accountable to being clean soon.

This coming weekend I'm planning on jumping and just hoping the bad sleep gets better by Sunday night.

Just reading back over this post shows how tired and out of it I am.  I feel like I can't even make sense or type out a clear paragraph.  

Honestly I'm not sure if I'm looking for advice or just wanting to vent with some people that know how difficult this is.  If you did a taper and want to tell me when your sleep improved I would love to hear that.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9996623992919922}"

I am not sure what I was taking for gpd, but I was taking a lot of extracts as well.  I would estimate at 30-40 gpd off and on for a few years.  This is my 4th time quitting CT and is the farthest I have ever made it.

At the beginning there was some temptation to go back and use ""just once"" but I overcame that.  I have focused a lot on meditation and physical exercise to fight back any cravings and work on making myself better.  The PAWS are still pretty intense from time to time.  I will admit it is very difficult to get motivated to do much of anything and I just have to force myself to workout or do whatever it is that I intended to do.  Once I get going, that feeling of laziness goes away.  The anxiety is pretty killer but I have a lot going on in my personal life as well, as I am in the middle of having to find a new job and direction in life as my place of employment is closing down.

Overall, I wouldn't change anything.  I chose a challenging time in life to quit, but I am succeeding and that makes men feel better.  In between the days of no motivation and anxiety I have moments of complete clarity where I can feel and think clearly for the first time in a long time.  There are other moments where I feel unstoppable and that I can take the whole world on, and I think these are glimpses of what is to come in life once I get through this process of quitting and staying quit.

For anyone looking to quit, I would highly recommend just taking the leap, but know it is never easy and requires a great deal of strength and mental discipline.  After a few weeks it seems silly that you had to rely on that green sludge just to feel normal, as you realize that nothing about that life is normal at all.  

For the first time in a long time I look forward to the future and the challenges it brings.  I look forward to making decisions on my own and developing myself to reach my full potential rather than lying to myself everyday as I hide away to take more capsules or drink more shots.  The person I was on K was just a zombie, a hollow shell of the person I once was and the person I am trying to become again.  It's all worth it.
