2021-12-30 21:51:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/rsjjcf/you_can_do_it/,You Can Do It,"It's been 3 months of tapering from 100gpd to 3gpd and 9 days since I jumped. Here is honest advice based on my experience for those of you who know you have an addiction and want to quit but worry about what lies ahead and need guidance.

I know all too well the feeling of impending doom and the void known as anhedonia. Kratom affects your brain and body in more ways than one. It is a battle on multiple fronts. Those of you who have quit other drugs in the past can probably attest to the fact that kratom is unique in the way it affects you mentally, unlike other drugs. It's because of this that you may feel pumped up the moment you set your foot down and say ""no more"" but you wake up the next day feeling like a soulless husk of a person, devoid of any direction. This is the first of many different lessons you must learn and practice if you want to gain and maintain sobriety. 

As a result of taking copious amounts of kratom frequently, you have taught your brain to put the cart in front of the horse so to speak (the cart being motivation and the horse being action). We all know how the story goes. We all remember that honeymoon phase. You try kratom for the first time, maybe after work or just after you wake up in the morning, and initially it feels so good that inadvertently it becomes a prerequisite in your mind to nearly every activity in your day. Think about it. Think about how many times you have justified the use of kratom, even for the most mundane of tasks. Waking up? Drink sludge. Going to bed? Drink sludge. Going out with friends? Drink sludge. Working out? Drink sludge. Feel sad? Drink sludge. Feel happy? Drink sludge. Suddenly you find yourself justifying your own existence as secondary to kratom, feeling like it is a necessity. 

You need to unlearn that. To become sober, you must accept that action comes first and motivation comes second. Practice that diligently enough and I promise there will come a time when you will feel the lust for life that you once had, but most importantly you will be able to look at yourself in the mirror and feel proud. In fact, I didn't need kratom to rant out this post you are reading right now and I still feel damn good about it. I figured that by typing out this post, I would help others like you see their journey and purpose with clarity, even if all hope seems lost. Now I feel very happy doing so! Action first, motivation second. 

Enough wisdom for now though. Here is my actual advice/experience with tapering. To start off, here is some basic information. I was addicted for 3 years prior with my highest use at 100gpd. I started because of depression as a result of losing a best friend to suicide. I am sure that many people here have started using as a result of mental illness as well. This can make your journey challenging, but it also provides you with an opportunity to actually fix the issue instead of ignoring it. I tried various methods of quitting, such as cold turkey or even a medically assisted suboxone taper treatment. Sometimes these methods work for other people, and I support that decision if it works for you. Personally I prefer tapering for the following reasons: it teaches you discipline, it teaches you to fill up your time in between doses with other activities, it doesn't feel like incessant torture, it allows you to attend to your everyday responsibilities, it reduces the severity of PAWS, and it allows your body as well as your mind to heal progressively. 

This does not mean that it is not difficult in its own way however. Newsflash to your addict brain, you won't feel high the vast majority of the time since you will spend most of that time adjusting to a lower dose. The best method of tapering is many low doses in shorter time intervals so you get a steady stream of alkaloids. I also suggest starting by taking off a significant portion of your daily intake at the beginning of your taper (25-50%) if you wish to speed up the process. I took 6 doses every day starting with 10 grams each dose (40% reduction) and reduced by each dose by 0.5 grams each time. Overtime I encourage you to try and wait longer before taking your dose if you can. It will teach you discipline and resiliency. Reduce your dosages by small amounts (<1 gram) every several days, or longer if necessary, especially during lower doses. Only you know what your body needs. I think it's a good time to start listening to it rather than shutting it away. 

Forget about the numbers, what about how it felt you might be asking? Well, initially it sucked as expected. In the beginning I spent a lot of my days biding my time until the next dose expecting a sweet release but instead I felt mediocre, so my mind shifted to the next dose. And the next dose. And the next dose. Slowly I began to accept the reality of my commitment and submitted myself to the process. Like I mentioned before, I began to fill my time with activities with the intention to distract myself until the next dose, but overtime I began to see the value of these activities within themselves. Cold showers, exercise, getting a new job, going to college again to finish the degree I should have finished sooner, learning my native language, wim hof breathing, meditation, and the list kept growing. Instead of waiting until my next dose to do stuff and adjusting my schedule around my doses, I began to adjust my schedule for myself primarily. This prepared me for when I crossed the line between low dose and threshold dose. I was worried about PAWS as you might expect. It was around this time that I no longer had an acute withdrawal symptoms between doses, but instead it became a mental battle. I cycled between anhedonia, depression, anxiety, and fatigue. It was at that point that I decided enough is enough and jumped at 3gpd, 0.5 grams each dose. You can't imagine how it feels to wake up and not be in acute withdrawal. It was exhilarating. Cherish moments like this, for initially after jumping they are few and far between. However, they become more frequent as the days go on. This is when PAWS will hit you the hardest if at all, but for me I already started feeling better around day 6. The first week or so is when you put the lessons you have learned from tapering to the test and embrace sobriety for the first time. It is not all sunshine and rainbows, it is moreso bittersweet. There will still be times when you become tired, sad, anxious, bored, or have cravings weeks, months, or years down the line, but this is normal. Some will confuse it for PAWS, but they must come to terms with sobriety for themselves. Life is uncomfortable at times. Suffering is the essence of humanity and what makes us strive towards the betterment of ourselves, others, and even society as a whole. You need to toss away this hedonistic perspective on life and embrace a stoic way of living. 

I sincerely hope this rant helps you in the same way that these lessons have helped me. To be forthright, I started this journey in a mental institution after attempting suicide. I lost my girlfriend of 3 years, my scholarship, my stellar grades, my job, the trust of my family, thousands of dollars, and nearly myself. If I can come out of that personal hell, I'm sure you can come out of yours, and I pray that you do. Don't allow yourself to destroy your life over a plant. Stay vigilant and I assure you that things will get better with time. I love you, and I think you should start to love yourself too. See you on the other side. I wish you the best of luck.",25,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9726706147193909}"

Aside from getting very scant sleep, waves of *intense* anxiety and a feeling of darkness have been the worst symptoms of withdrawing from this shit. Well, my body has felt like aching jello, so i spend a lot of time lying on the floor.    Alas, I've pushed through it and am feeling decentish at the moment, on day 5.         Liposomal C and Gabapentin have presumably been responsible for my physical symptoms being tolerable. I've experienced no RLS, no diarrhea, no runny nose, minimal sweats. I have been super chilly but that's lessening gradually.

Last night I was feeling relatively at peace. I'd gotten virtually zero sleep the night before, even with the gabapentin, which I was ready to ditch.  In lieu of that, in the wee hours of day 5, not anticipating easy sleep, I decided to take some benadryl. Not that it's a particularly healthy sleep aid option, but I've used it occasionally with success.   I took 75mg rather than the 50 that've worked for me in the past (I know just 25 works for some but I'm a big fella).      Well, the first 20 minutes or so didn't seem to bring me the anticipated drowsiness, but I laid down in bed. After another 10, my left shoulder, chest and neck all tightened up severely. I started to feel panicked and agitated, in that particularly inescapable way where you know it's not just your own physiology. Something was causing it. I did a quick search on benadryl and kratom withdrawal and saw that it fired up peoples most pronounced symptoms when taken, even weeks out.     RLS for the majority, but for me, like a few posters, it was brutal anxiety.   I saw a thread where someone pointed out that RLS and anxiety seem to be sort of interchangeable as folks' prominent issues, with or without benadryl (those who don't get RLS seem to experience anxiety instead). Pretty interesting.     Anyway, after about 1.5 hours of it not subsiding, with sunrise approaching, I took some more gabapentin in hopes of counteracting these effects. After about an hour it kicked in and I got a solid 7 hours of sleep. More than twice my longest span prior.      But, I definitely feel janky from the benadryl. A little groggy, but more notably, the tension it brought on in my chest/neck/shoulder has lingered.    Considering how much I've valued the diminishing of the acutes, it feels like some sort of setback. But I suppose it's just it's own issue and otherwise my progress is the same. Does anyone know why antihistamines cause this, or the implications ?   Tell me it's not an actual setback !     I'd anticipated today being the first sort of over-the-hump day but now it's a funky one. And not Clyde Stubblefield funky.

I know what was going on in my life, but I don't know the date.  I suspect this is because I  don't want to face the actual amount of time I've been taking it.  I started off with an extract, dabbled in leaf, and of course, went back to extract because leaf doesn't compare after that, in my opinion.

Years prior to using kratom, I had a pretty bad opiate habit.  I quit using those, mostly because I moved, and someone suggested kratom.  Now I wish I never started taking it.  I've been hooked on the extract shots for years, and honestly it's killing me most in the wallet.  

After many ups and downs, I've finally realized that I'll never have the life I want if I don't quit.  I've tried to quit before, to no avail.  I feel so stuck.  I'm trying to switch to regular leaf and quit from there.  It's day two with no extract, only a few leaf capsules.  It sucks, but mostly just psychologically.  And I feel very lethargic.

This weekend is it,"I want to thank everyone who responded to my last post. I had asked if folks found it counterproductive to continue tapering when you started to get to low doses (as in 5 or less gpd). Some people described tapering to basically zero with little wd, but even more people felt that towards the end of the taper, the small doses weren’t doing much to stop the wd symptoms and they just jumped. 

I decided to split the difference. I had posted earlier in the week when I was going to continue tapering for another two weeks or so and jump at one 0.6 gram capsule per day. But instead, I just tossed everything this morning with the exception of the final three capsules that I’ll take today.

Truth be told, I’m not particularly concerned about acute wd. It sucks, but I know from previous tapers that it’s not the worse. Especially when you have the liberty to just chill out for a few days.

The worst symptoms for me are usually insomnia and rls (though I seem to only get it in my arms). But I also find that rls is only really bad when I lay there wide awake, trying to force myself to sleep. That being said, I’ve decided I won’t force myself to try to sleep and will just accept the restlessness for what it is. A withdrawal symptom. And if I end up with a handful of sleepless, video game filled nights, so be it.

I started going to therapy and that was part of my decision that a therapist won't take me seriously as an addict. I finally realized if they told me to stop then maybe I'll consider it. I figured if I was fine with stopping it they tell me, I might as well stop.

This has to be the last time, this fucked up my life, and not in ways you would think. I found it as an escape from being socially anxious to using it to get so many things about myself accomplished. How could it not then be a tool?

I took it from 19 to now 23. I have never been in a relationship, and I thought it would help make me confident enough to get into one. It did though make me so comfortable with myself I didn't care about others, family, friends, I said fuck em all. I've been alone and I must have been hurting this entire time, in a super important time in my life, and I just found something to blind me to that.

I'm so fucking scared and behind. I'm not even off of it but I want to cry. And of course I haven't been able to cry on it for years. Even when I had thought I went into psychosis from another failed attempt at a relationship that caused me to lash out on friends and cut a ton of ties.

God fucking dammit I know tomorrow is the last day and I've had that prepped for a few weeks now. I just am not even off of it yet and I'm reflecting on how much this took from me. I want those years back to explore myself instead of not caring and making it harder now that I'm older.

Even in a consultation with another therapist he asked, ""Are you burying emotions?"" And I laughed and said, ""Probably yea."" Then later I realized that laugh is probably some of this hurt trying to come out to say yes. That made me want to cry. But of course, I still can't yet.

How did this happen. It accelerates years so much that I was just a scared 19 year old kid that thought I found a way out. It wasn't a way out, it was a portal to now. And I'm more scared than ever.

I just really wanted to say this all and that for once, I will actually care what a stranger says on the internet because I'll actually have the emotions to feel the sympathy for once lol.

I started wanting to be done when i realized how dependent i was on it. Always ensuring i dont run out and the 1000 other issues it caused were becoming exhausting.
I quit 3 times before it stuck. The last time i promised myself if i went the withdrawals i wouldnt put myself through it again. I took tylonol and didnt scale down first. I knew that if i wanted to be done i had to get it completely out of my system.The shakes, restless legs, sweats were miserable but after the first few days they got better. It would take about a month for them to completely stop.
One thing i want to caution is mental health because the post depression crash is real. It didnt really hit until a week or two post quitting but when it hit it hit HARD. I think its important to find an outlet during these times to vent. These boards worked great for me and being in recovery/attending mestings helped too. 
This might sound pretty intimidating to jump into but this is just my experience. I will say that if i can anyone can. The best advice if your going through it is to remind yourself how far in the journey youve come and that you never have to go through it again. Seriously fuck that stuff, its overpriced dirt that hits the same addiction receptors as opiates.

For about 3 years, I have been consuming kratom tea from my places of employment (kava bars) and have quit temporarily 3-4 times, I am so ready to be done with this shit already.

I was consuming \~30g a day for the past 9 months, tapered off with capsules, and today is the first day I have had absolutely none. 2 days ago, I had made it all day without, but started having such severe RLS over my entire body that I caved the next morning and got a small tea, drank half right there and then, and the other half before bed.

I have done this before, albeit not for good. The RLS over my whole entire body, most severe in my arms, is the ONE symptom I cannot deal with, due to the lack of sleep aspect. I was given a few valium pills (thanks Grandpa) to try and help with it. I'm going to order some Magnesium Threonate for this as well, recommended by a commenter on this subreddit.

As I am sitting typing this, I can feel the pulled-tight-electric-rubberbands in my muscles feeling that I know will get much worse until it goes away eventually. As well as serious hot flashes and head/neck pain.

Tomorrow morning, I go back into work for the first time since I've begun the process of quitting- where I have **unlimited access to kratom tea.** I'm adding this here to try and keep me accountable, hear from others that are on this journey, and apologize as well- I was one of those people who encouraged customers to try kratom for themselves, and have seen others fall into dependence as well. I can no longer in good faith do this, and if I come upon people wanting to try it their first time, I'm going to warn them the way I wish I had been warned in the beginning of working in this industry.

Kratom was definitely a large factor in the deterioration of the relationship as it killed our sex drives, but I digress.

I decided to use this pain to turn my life around. Get back into bodybuilding/powerlifting that kratom (and Covid) robbed from me, be motivated and strong & just be a better person. I used to have this hunger to achieve my fitness goals, but Kratom turned me soft.

However the pain is still fresh. I think about her constantly. It was getting easier, then I decided to go ct from kratom. After 2 days the emotional sides have been brutal, and to top it off gyms have shut down again. I can’t even go outside because it’s ~-10 C every day and kratom wd make me feel very cold even when I would normally be sweating. Should I try tapering at least until I’ve accepted the breakup and gyms open up again?

I've mostly been using extracts and tinctures (OPMS, Zen, Super K), so it's difficult to say the amount I've been taking, but for the last three weeks its been about 3 shots per day, mostly dosing within a 3-4 hour window beginning at noon. Until recently I wasn't aware of how dependent I'd become. A few months ago I would have one or two days per week when I didn't even take any at all, but for the past three weeks it's been an every day thing. Last week I had a day in which I experienced the worst, most debilitating anxiety I'd ever experienced in my life. It didn't occur to me until the next day it was symptoms of withdrawal. In the last three days I've begun to taper down to only 1 shot per day, 1/2 in the daytime and 1/2 at night. Since becoming aware of my dependence, the symptoms of anxiety and depression that come up after 6-8 hours without using have become extremely clear. 

For those who have quit or are in the process of quitting, what would you recommend as the best course of action? Should I try to go cold turkey or continue tapering down?

I am a 25 year old male in good shape. I have made one other post documenting my journey. I quit Kratom cold turkey and have quit smoking although I would have a cig here and there. I quit everything because of sudden panic attacks. I would do large doses of Kratom, drink 5-6 cups of coffee, chain smoke, and drink alcohol and smoke marijuana every night. I decided to quit after 2 panic attacks where I thought I was going down. The last 17 days I have pushed myself to sobriety and have been exercising and taking care of my brain and body. I am really happy to have made it this far. There have been more ups than downs this last week, but there will be ups then downs in this whole experience. It’s hard to stabilize a good mood throughout the whole day. Most of the heavy physical symptoms such as RLS, insomnia, muscle soreness, hot flashes/chills, flu-like symptoms have subsided. I feel much better physically. I have taken time off work and have been working out daily. The downside, I definitely feel like I am dealing with PAWS. 

The first week and half were physical and psychological withdrawal. Now it’s just mostly psychological. The only physical that has remained is indigestion, but that has improved. Remember the mind and gut are connected. The depression and anxiety will linger. The worst part about this last week is I will have random panic attacks. I will feel good and then the panic sets in out of no where and I will have trouble breathing, my heart will race, and it’s accompanied by terrible anxiety and dizziness. I just had one right before I started typing this. I had to lay down and it passed. The crazy thing is I feel great when they do pass. Almost a feeling of euphoria when it’s gone. My theory is that my brain is recalibrating and balancing itself out. Perhaps I was doing so much my body stopped making certain chemicals and now I am being flooded back with all of them. I am optimistic going forward and I am very appreciative of having this community to help me get through it. One thing that has helped me the most is staying hydrated and exercise. Seriously exercise will make this rough process a bit easier. I am only drinking a cup or two of coffee and a couple cups of green tea and a ton of water. Running, planks, pull ups/push-ups and light weights will help. The endorphin rush is great. One thing I can’t wait for is sunny weather again. It’s been harder these cold/dark days, but by the time the sun is out again I will be the best version of myself. More healthy and happy than when I was an athlete in high school.

I work 50 hours this week and next week will be similar, there really is no ""taking a week off"" for me right now. 

Maybe I involve my mom and have her give me my tapered doses? Problem is shes working a lot of the time so she'd have to give me my doses for the whole day and I can already see myself taking more at once and then buying another bag. 
 
I'm kind of at a loss. I'm too deep to ct without symptoms, but don't have the mental strength to stick to a taper.

Now, when I think about using kratom, I roll my eyes and just think about something else, like my dog or tea or literally anything else that brings me joy. Kratom is no good. Garbage drug. If you really want to quit, get yourself in a good position to do so by tapering, making a plan that you can follow through on when things get rough, stock up on healthy foods, tell someone, and/or whatever else works for you. Then you have to just fucking do it. When the urge comes to use, be ready for it, and tell yourself that kratom is not a part of your life anymore. Say this over and over to yourself, as many times as you have to, until the day when you wake up and you don’t have to say it because kratom is actually, truly, no longer a part of your life anymore.

I have chronic pain from a previous neck surgery, and degenerative joint disease in my hip. I wanted off of prescription pain meds and spoke to my doctor about trying kratom instead. He looked it up and said he’d support giving it a shot. He said since the crack down on narcotic prescriptions, he’s open to alternative “medications”.  It took a while to find my sweet spot, even having gone through a period of very heavy use. I kept lowering my dosage as after a while, I would have increasing negative side effects (gi upset, headaches, tremors, even a couple of seizures ). I ended up at 5g every 6-7 hrs for a long time. The last week, I even dropped to 4g, but had developed stabbing pain in my upper abdomen on Thursday which was very scary. So I decided to stop kratom all together and switch back to the left over pain meds I had on hand. Being the holiday weekend, I didn’t want to bother my doctor and had enough to get through until I could see my doctor on Monday. I had a rough weekend with abdominal pain, but all other side effects resolved quickly. 

I went in to see my doctor and told him what I was experiencing. I told him I switched back to traditional pain meds and wanted to stay off the kratom completely. I just felt like it had done it’s job, but now has turned on me and it’s time to stop. He did some more research and is concerned I may have developed some liver toxicity. But as my symptoms are improving, will just keep an eye on me for the week. If not improved in a week, will do a CT and draw labs. 

He has also started me on a tapering dose of prescription pain medication to get to the lowest effective dose to manage my pain. He did inform me that I will be experiencing w/d symptoms from the kratom, but should be better managed with the prescription meds. I have been experiencing chills, body aches, and runny nose. But it’s certainly manageable. 

I’m going to have to be on some sort of pain management plan due to my medical conditions. I’m just not going to be free of some sort of substance. I’m starting to accept that. I don’t necessarily like that, but it is what it is. But after all I’ve gone through with kratom, the good and the bad, I’m glad to be off of it. I won’t miss the unpredictability of side effects or interactions (which caused serotonin syndrome a couple of times).  At least with the pain meds, I know exactly what I’m getting, every time, and can rely on how it’s going to affect me each and every time I take it. And should I need to have another surgery, which is highly likely, I won’t have to worry about how the kratom is going to affect me or interact with  other medications/anesthesia. They know what to do with someone who’s been on meds, not so much with kratom. 

I realize I’ve basically just switched from one thing to another. My point is that I’d rather deal with the known side effects rather than the unpredictability I experienced on kratom. And with the probability of needing further medical interventions, I’m far more comfortable having been on something they’re familiar with. I have had serotonin syndrome 3 times due to very innocently having taken another medication which unknowingly would interact with the kratom in a way that would not have otherwise interacted with the pain meds. 

I’m so glad to finally be off I’d the kratom. It’s like a friend I’d always relied on, only to find out it was stabbing me in the back. And grateful for an open-minded, non-judgemental doctor to work with.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9957062602043152}"

Here is my advice...","For me, it goes just like the way it says in the book of NA-AA.  Each additional relapse is way worse than the last one.  How true that is!  Ive been on and off Kratom for about 5 years.  For the last month or two I was taking around 200 pills a day = 100 mg.  Sometimes, I would just say ""fuck it"" and not even count.  I would just pour out a boatload of pills in my hand and throw them in my mouth.  Gulp it down and continue to live in a hell that I can't even put into words.  This run lasted about 6 months and this is what I did to get to day 7: (I don't feel amazing, but pretty darn good!)

\- if you are on a high dose and have been for a long time, I would keep a couple grams to only take at night (if you can).  This will help you get through the restless leg and arm part a little easier.  Also, I would recommend getting your hands on some kind of sleep aid to get through the first 3 days...

\- I took a bunch of CBD.  Ive read studies that it helps with dopamine production.  Whether this is true or not, it seemed to fix my anhedonia I had on day 4 and 5.  (I think)  

\- Always keep in mind, that the journey of detoxing from this shit is not as bad as your mind might make it out to be.  The days will go by quick and before you know it, you will have regained a little bit of yourself.  This will continue...  good luck!

I do struggle with depression and anxiety as my baseline and the holidays have always been tough, this year much more so because of covid.

Or any substance. I'm just making note of what has helped me so far.

There wasn't much I could do three days in because I was puking from something else (related but not just the WDs) then I was just nauseous from the WDs.

Basically, here's what I noticed helped me feel a tiny bit better at times. After the horrific few days.

ZZZQuil . A friend suggested Benedril and non addictive over the counter pain meds/ anti inflammatory. Something like this combines them and is easy to take. Though caution could be used since it has Benedril or something like it in there. When the sleeps been difficult I've taken this a few different times. It has indeed knocked me out but it brings out more sleep/night sweats, since those were already there anyway. Plus general morning grogginess. 

Just by itself--- Ibuprofen. It's an anti inflammatory pen med (as I'm sure you all know) I had been taking it already for dental issues. What I noticed when taking it through WDs, severe and mild, it provided relief for both the terrible aches/cramps AND RLS. I guess it eases inflammation on the nerves too. When I just take this before a pre sleep Epsom salt soak (that helps too btw) it actually relaxes me as much if not more so than ZZZQuil, as what keeps me awake is restlessness and pain. 
I generally take 800 pharmacy grade dose because my dental issues cause me a LOT of pain. Not just the WDs.

Valerian root. I had to take double the bottles recommended amount to get the relaxed, anti anxiety affect and it didn't last long (I had taken it as a teenager a long time ago and still have a tolerance to it. Very easy to build up with valerian) it did help a bit through the worst. 
Found melatonin messed with the RLS a bit more than helped it. 
Maybe that's just me though.
Sleepytime tea too. Especially good for nausea too.

Weed. Specifically edibles. I noticed just eating a little of something strong actually kinda stabilized me and my anxiety. Smoking is a bit much for me, as I generally don't consume cannabis at all. The last time I tried edibles to soothe WDs the first attempt the WDs were so bad I didn't feel anything the cookies were intended to even though I got groggy. The edibles probably worked better this time Because I tried them into day 22 instead of 12 hours in. But cannabis might help other folx more early on and in different methods. Everyone is different. Though this will almost certainly help with nausea and appetite. 

I've seen vitamin C and other supplements suggested. Haven't tried them yet and intend to. 

Make sure to hydrate, eat well/healthy and stay physically active, if at all possible. Those things are fing difficult at any stage but you will feel better/stronger and you'll heal faster. 
Also distractions. Keep the mind and hands busy. 

I hope this helps. Apologies if there are already similar threads. 
Hang in there everyone. We got this!

Edit-- I know it might be tempting but I found alcohol made me feel worse, especially sobering up. Maybe it's different for other folx but already being depressed this was not helpful and I'm not trying this anymore.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9660248160362244}"

Input appreciated !,"Holiday commitments have been fulfilled and I am now on day 1 CT.      Been nearly 4 months of use, averaging probably 15gpd, but upwards of 25gpd these last couple weeks.     My doc prescribed me 900mg gabapentin per day for the acute withdrawal.  She gave me no further/specific instructions.   I've read dozens of personal anecdotes on here regarding this, and about gabapentin for withdrawal from opioids. I've collected screenshots and text, hoping to hone my own approach, but it all varies pretty greatly.  Plus, there is apparently a lot of disagreement on how gabapentin is most effectively used off-label, just generally.   Stacking doses for titration ?  Empty/full stomach ?    And, some quitting kratom seem to have luck with 200-300mg doses as needed, while others need 3-4 times as much stacked quickly ?

Basically- I'm trying to use the meds most efficiently while still maximizing their effects.  I will only be using them for the first 4, maybe 5 days, and I don't have an ongoing supply.

Please share your experiences with this if you've got em !       Details on dosages/timing, the effects on mental/physical withdrawal symptoms,  the gpd/duration of kratom use, etc are *greatly* appreciated.

TL;DR: How did you use gabapentin to ease kratom withdrawal ?

What amount / what dosing schedule ?        How did it work ?

EDIT: I know the topic's been discussed here and that information abounds on the greater web- 

I just want concise accounts from former kratom users because it's clear there's no *conventional* approach !

Prior to quitting, I was super into rock climbing and would always be at the rock gym. I would use the weights and machines at the gym and do a core circuit most nights before bed because I really wanted to improve my climbing. But I literally do not care about rock climbing at all after quitting. Like I can force myself to take an hour long hike even when I don’t feel like it, but I just cannot get myself to go to the rock gym. I’d probably just take the L if I didn’t miss my old body so much. And like I do believe that feeling physically strong and physically capable is important for your mental well-being, so even though I don’t currently feel depressed about being weak, I do worry that I eventually will start to feel that way. 


Also probably worth noting that I had a job that was heavy in manual labor prior to quitting, but now that we’re in the off season I’m not getting my eight daily hours of exercise anymore. So I’m sure that a lot of my lost muscle mass is coming from that.

I did this micro dose for around 6 weeks - super small amounts, maybe 3 or 4 days a week, sometimes only 2 days and then some of the anxiety side effects came back. So dumb. I threw the bag away and realized I can never ever touch k again…and I haven’t since. So that was my one and only slip. It was scary and I was reminded of the psychological mind eff Kratom plays on you. 

1 year later, I can say your neural pathways get reset and life becomes manageable without it. I did have to change aspects of my lifestyle - I started drinking superfoods, I took a course on transcendental meditation and I do that daily. Other than that, I confronted a lot in the year without Kratom. It wasn’t a magic year. Some good things happened and some tough things happened. I started taking the green crap partly cause of depression, so I had to figure out how to deal with mental health issues the proper medical way. 

I will never go back to k. The side effects were scary - hair loss, oral thrush. This crap is not a solution. It’s a trap. I recall being stuck in that loop and needing to dose and the relief I had when I initially realized I could wake up and be ok. Where ever you are in your journey, I’m wishing you luck. Even if it feels hard right now, just ride it out…cause in 1 year’s time, you won’t even think about it anymore. You’ll barely remember it.",19,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9969459176063538}"

So beginning of the month I took an ill thought out toss and wash dose that ended up pretty much getting me deathly sick for three days. In that time I couldn't keep kratom down or anything else so I decided it was time to jump. 

Due to the double whammy of food poisoning and bad WDs I had a horrific time getting through it. Felt like I was actually dying.

Fast forward to now,  I'm still off of kratom, past the bad WD part but am still kinda struggling. My energy is in the shitter, RLS still a thing, I still can't sleep and the aches are still present. Cravings too. I hate that I dream about it when I manage a few hours. They're fever dreams pretty much.

The food poisoning is probably part of why my energy is so low. Depression is also a thing along with intense anxiety. So I've been legit sick for this month. I almost wish I went to rehab for this.

Awfully hard to remain confident in my mental health when these random waves of anxiety combined with negative intrusive thoughts stop me in my tracks out of no where. 

And it’s even harder when doctors and psychiatrists don’t officially acknowledge Post Acute Withdrawal Symptoms as a real condition. 

I know some of you might say that my anxiety is an underlying condition but I have only experienced this sort of anxiety and mental state after quitting Kratom. 
Desperately looking for others who are in the same boat as I am please tell me I’m not crazy and please tell me that this is my brain healing

To anyone reading this and still hasn’t quit kratom now is the time more than ever. It’s an amazing drug with terrible consequences, no matter how often or little you use it there is a price to pay.

Your opiate receptors play many roles besides getting you high and making you feel good and when you mess with them you mess with a lot of other stuff so it is with a heart full of love that I tell you guys please be aware of this thing called Kratom it is an opiate and should be treated as such",21,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9820760488510132}"

It's been 1 year since I've touched Kratom or any opiate. Truthfully I had doubts that I'd make it this far but here I am. Alive, breathing, surviving, and thriving. Alot has changed over the past year. 

My physical health has improved greatly with a focus on eating well and staying active. Stomach has gone back to normal. I have control over my bladder again. I've managed to gain a few pounds and increase my strength. Which is something I've never been able to do my whole life. 

My mental health has improved tremendously, I still get a bit of paranoia from time to time but episodes are so infrequent and I'm about to recognize when my mind is just playing tricks on me. My emotional state has leveled out and I no longer shift mood on a dime. The cloud has faded and I am no longer numb. Feeling again took some time to get used to, every emotion was overwhelming there for a few months. But it feels so good to feel again. Good, bad, otherwise, just feels great to feel anything. 

I've got myself a new job that I'm doing well in. Making the most I've ever made while having more free time than I've ever had. Truthfully don't think I'd have landed this gig if I was using. 

I'm rekindling relationships with friends and family. Building new relationships with people. And just generally being a more open and honest person. It feels great to be yourself and not live a lie. 

To anyone out there wondering if this might be the time to quit, I'd certainly advocate for it. Your health is at stake here. I encourage you to do what's right for your mind, your body, and your soul. It will not be easy, but I promise you that it gets easier. You won't regret it in the long run.

That and eating much healthier has been instrumental in losing 75 pounds since April of this year, which was well needed.

This sucks ass. Literally 30 seconds ago my grandma asked me if I have a cold because I’ve been sneezing so much. I thought I’d be at the tail end of the withdrawal at this point — and have very little symptoms.

WRONG.

I’d say I might feel a little better than day 1, but not by much. I’m so sick of this. 

Regarding the title, has anyone else felt like they’re life was on fast forward when taking kratom? Like they lived in groundhog’s day? Like life had become such a boring, monotonous slew that it’d be better to not live at all than live like this?

If withdrawal is hell, then addiction is purgatory. 

I’d rather take the withdrawal — at least the hell ends at some point. 

I’m excited to have my ambition back and zest for life. I feel like I’ve been fucking lobotomized. I’m not the person I once was; I’ve become an empty shell of a man.

I’ve been thinking about how to get back to my old, fun loving, excited, adventurous self. The only way I’ve come up with is to begin doing things that make me feel alive, and let the feelings follow. Not the other way around.

I’ve been through CT Xanax withdrawal before and it was certainly worse than this from a physical standpoint, but I don’t know if it was as bad mentally. And personally, I’d rather take a few extra cramps/diarrhea bouts than the meaningless monotony I’m in now. I’m someone that would rather have a migraine than a bout with depression and anxiety, but that’s just me. Hell, when I broke my arm and front teeth, and ripped my tendon off the bone I was in far less pain than my emotions have put me.

Either way, I’m grateful to be sober and alive again. Kratom, towards the end, was actually making me experience depersonalization and paranoia. That was the final nail in my kratom coffin. That’s why I quit — and actually stuck with it. Schizophrenia runs very strong in my family, and I just couldn’t keep experiencing that kind of psychotic feeling. I don’t like the feeling of losing my mind; it’s a very scary proposition. It’s funny because as I was feeling these symptoms, I was listening to a Stanford lecture on schizophrenia. It said that dopamine is extremely well-linked to psychosis and schizophrenia. If you reduce a Schizophrenic person’s dopamine, their symptoms lessen. If you raise a normal person’s dopamine long-term using medication, their risk of schizophrenia skyrockets. Meth psychosis (from extreme dopamine) is so similar to schizophrenia that doctors can almost never tell them apart without knowledge of the person’s use. 

Either way, thanks for letting me rant — and let me know if you’ve experienced anything similar. I’m going to try to wrap some presents and fill out cards now; I’ve been putting it off for days now.

This isn't my first time tapering and I've noticed in previous tapers, that once I start getting down to around 5 gpd, tapering lower starts to become very difficult. 

When I began my taper, it was easy to basically take a gram every hour and I'd feel fine. The mornings would be a little rough and it would take 2 or 3 of these spaced out, one gram doses to start feeling better. It made it easier though, because the next little dose was always very close. But obviously, one can't sustain that regular of a dosing schedule when you start to get down to very low doses. 

My question is, for those who successfully tapered, who waited until they were basically taking zero grams and who jumped sooner? I ask because I'm starting to suspect that continuing to taper is just drawing out the low level withdrawal and perhaps I should just make the jump? But I also don't want to throw myself into the deep end, so to speak. It's just not entirely clear that these doses are doing anything other than keeping me shackled.

I've managed to cut my dosing down to 1/4 of what it was. I officially started 3 capsules 3 days ago. Depression is a lingering factor but I am pressing on. 

I have been on a taper for two months now and I am continuing my progress towards zero.

This is the lowest dose I have had (aside from the two month cold turkey I did about 7 years ago, I failed because of boredom and depression) since I started this in 2009.

My method was an immediate 50% cut in usage, believe it or not this wasn't hard to cut to 6. I got depression as a withdrawal symptom but nothing else. Then over the course of every two weeks I cut down by one pill. Seems like the lower you go the harder it actually is, 5 to 4 was weirdly pretty hard stage. 

Considering my life circumstance right now (the love of my life is leaving me in a month for 3 years for her career, she will be back but it was completely unexpected), I still have zero desire to go back to where I was.

I drank Kratom everyday for a little over a year before starting to taper in July. I wasn't even measuring how much I was taking but it was at least 3 tablespoons per day, sometimes more so about 30 grams at least a day for over a year. I know that's not the best way to measure it but I wasn't thinking it would be as tough as it is to get off of it.

In July I tried to quit CT but it was soo difficult. Then I tried a quick taper but that was also too much for me to handle. I decided to taper by one teaspoon a month and I'm actually down to two teaspoons a day  so I'm a little ahead of what I planned. I went from 30+ gpd to about 7 gpd now. 

A long time ago I was taking 1.5mg a day of Klonopin for 4 years. Then I was prescribed 1800 mg a day of Gabapentin to taper off Klonopin. I used Kratom to taper off Gabapentin. I was able to taper off Kratom without using anything else. The headaches and night sweats are very real though and I had to cancel plans multiple times because I was ""sick"" from withdrawals. I still have about 2 months until I'm completely off Kratom also.

And it was.....horrendous. Sure, I got a feel-good sensation for maybe 45 minutes, but that was immediately followed by a pounding headache that is currently lasting for hours. The brain fog, the apathy, the depression, it all came roaring back. It seems that my body is not interested in kratom any longer. It actively wants it gone. It was so crappy, that I just threw the 2nd shot in the trash.

In a way, I'm so glad this happened. This was a purely negative experience, and I know now that going back to kratom is pointless. There is nothing positive that will come from doing it again.

I know that there are a shit ton of other people who have much worse to deal with and a lot more on their plate, but I needed something to shunt my attention and I got the idea that I could maybe just bitch on reddit for a little bit about my withdrawal symptoms.

I've been taking kratom for around 2 years, and at my worst point I was at around 45-60 gpd (i didn't break down and buy a 20 dollar kitchen scale until way too late unfortunately). I managed to step down to 32 gpd since I graduated from college in May, and Ive been fighting to taper down more and eventually quit. It's been a learning process and I've tried a lot of different methods, but I finally managed to find a system that works for me around mid October, and as of my present bitching, I've managed to make it to 22.80 gpd.

Up until last Friday, I was well acquainted with my normal withdrawal symptoms, and even though they were unpleasant at best and completely shitty at worst, I felt like they were manageable because they were familiar, flu-like symptoms... But since then my body has been presenting a new symptom: a burning sensation running from my left ear down the left side of my neck and into my shoulder. I know that it's nerve pain related to psychoactive agent withdrawal, and that my skin isn't really burning, and that it's not permanent, but..........

....... I fucking hate it. I fucking hate it. I fucking hate it. I never thought I would say this, but I really wish I could trade this in and have my old, regular, ""Flu-like"" symptoms back. At least I know how to triage flu-like symptoms.

The first couple of days it almost fractured my willpower, and I did end up bumping my dose by 0.1g (0.4 gpd total) for now; but I think I'm starting to mentally channel that hatred towards kratom itself. I know if I can do that successfully it will give me the strength to keep pushing down... but I mean fuck it's like ""Please God I already know I'm going to burn in hell and I know I absolutely deserve it, but can you please please please find it in your heart to stop giving me free samples while I'm alive?""

Anyway, I think I'm done bitching, and I guess I do feel a little better for now.

Sucks, but I'm probably shouldn't take wellbutrin anyway until I quit the kratom.

I also started journaling about how I feel, and it's helped me really understand how much of a trainwreck I've become. I can't function, not really. I had the worst panic attack of my life yesterday that lasted for hours, and I ended up calling a crisis line from work, then went right to bed crying when I went home, with my husband lying next to me helping me breathe. I didn't take any kratom for a period of 12 hours when I started having RLS big time.

I keep my journal on drive so I can access it from anywhere, and next week I see my counselor who is fully appraised of the situation, including my past addictions. The only question I never know how to answer is why I started taking it. I've never been in touch with myself well enough to know why I start anything, but I've had some past trauma that I'm hoping to process too since I never have.

I was literally unable to respond but I saw messages coming through during the haze and I knew what they were.

So I guess to be specific: mid 30s male, 3 years daily use, between 35-60gpd.... i tried tapering but no deal.

Around Oct 12 I decided enoigh was enough - and just went CT (I dont remember this decision).

Kratom was fucking my life up. My sleep was terrible and immediately upon awakening required approx 8g dose just to feel ""normal""

Ive struggled with substances throughout my adult life - mostly alcohol - and kratom was sold to me as a safe easy alternative. Boy was that wrong.

I was highly functioning throughout my 3 years of use... or so I thought... the end was torment, sleep issues, and extreme WD after even short periods without dosing.

Not meaning to scare anyone - but the initial 10 day WD felt much worse than I have yet seen described here. I had a doctor friend checking in on me who advised I was exhibiting symptoms of acute opiate WD (I dont even remember seeing her but she was here every day making sure I at least drank water)

It was hell. No doubt. Much more extreme than I ever anticipated.

Again, some people from this forum were sending me messages I could barely read. But I knew they were there. Thank you so much. Really.

Following the couple weeks of detox I got pretty bad cold/flu symptoms... in conjunction with remaining physical and psychological WD = couch ridden.

Following that I was able to leave the house for like 1 hour at a time to meet a friend for coffee or even go for a walk... afterwards total exhaustion. There WERE a few days there I perked up and even went surfing and on a hike (powered through)

Perhaps quitting CT weakens the immune system because after those few days of semi-reprieve - i got sick again, this time with respitory virus (negative cv) which has lasted up until this week.... i got all my bloodwork and other tests done which all came back clean (thankfully).. so I was told to just keep fighting the mental and physical battles.

Still, I have issues with sleep, energy, and even taking a shower seems like training for boot camp. But I AM getting better (even though sometimes it feels like I never will)

One thing I realize is the mental/psychological chemistry will take a while to rebalance.... another and maybe for some readers more important is I KNOW that going back on K is NOT going to solve anything.

There is so much more I could say and maybe I will follow up again.... but i just wanted to share my experience to try and compensate for those who tried to help me in my time of need on this thread.

When in doubt, and I want to give up or use, I literally say to myself ""suck it up bitch. Just go one more day."".... and then the next day I try and do the same.

I am recovering - but not as fast as expected - but I definitely am - and it is so worth it. After this hell literally the last thing I want to do is ingest that substance again.

I'll try and keep yall posted as I progress - and if anyone wants to reach out or chat or need support, hit me up. Trust me, I've been through the wringer.",26,"{'immun': 1, 'virus': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9989230036735535}"

Kratom no longer working so am going to quit...,"So I have been taking kratom to combat my severe depression. I have been taking kratom for about a year. The maximum amount I was taking was 8-10g per day but I had had fairly long periods of taking only 0.5-1.5gpd. recently I have been taking close to 10gpd for like a month but it hardly feels like anything now and the depression is in full force. It may be because I am tapering down from my antidepressants or it could be because the kratom I bought isn't as potent as the last. but one of the reasons I want to quit is because I am quite scared about how much I would need to take to feel normal because 10gpd doesn't cut it anymore apparently. I also have very bad constipation and complete sexual dysfunction even on the smaller doses. I have never had any physical withdrawal symptoms (no runny nose etc) and I'm pretty sure I haven't really had any cravings per say, more the fact that if I stop taking kratom my depression comes back in full swing and I find it unbearable.

Single dose  Tomorrow will be 4 grams. I have used kratom as a pre-workout since I don't like to take standard pre-workout/caffeine as I work out after work and don't want it keeping me awake. I'm curious if either of these may work as a temp solution while I try to get back to normal. Looking for something to have on hand to help with motivation in the morning and/or prior to working out after work. Curious if anyone has any thoughts on DLPA vs L-Tyrosine? I bought mucuna puriens but after more research I have read that may downgrade dopamine receptors if taken to long. I only plan to take that if I absolutely need it. It has helped a few mornings but it may not be worth the risk. Just looking for something to help with motivation/drive while finishing this taper and into when I quit completely. Shoot even a placebo pill may help lol. 

Anyway hope you are all doing well. This hasn't been easy but I think back to the times where I used to enjoy life without having a crutch like kratom. I keep telling myself that one day I will hopefully get back to my pre kratom/alcohol days. I quit alcohol using kratom which is no better.

I have had no noticeable withdrawal symptoms this week! No restless legs at all.

I imagine a lot of people combing this forum as the New Year approaches and thinking of quitting kratom as part of a New Year's resolution.  Just know - you can do it!  Tapers work.  It's probably not going to be as bad as you're making it out to be in your mind.  Remember - a lot more people will log in to post negative or challenging experiences than those who will come to say ""not much is happening.""  It's a more ""boring"" post, and they're just out there living life, and that's why you don't hear so much about the quits that aren't that hard.

We get scared when we think of everything bad that might happen when we let go.  Kratom logic convinces us that we can't do it, or we can't do it right now.  Don't listen to it.  Go slow, or clear your schedule and commitments for a CT if that's more your style.  For some of us that's a much harder route, some aren't suited to a taper.  Figure out which one you are, make your plan, make a list of your reasons, tell some people who are important to you, and start!

I’ve been a part of this group for a few months now. I’m a petite girl and I’ve been taking probably between 20-30 gpd for about nine months. The hardest part is in the mornings, I wake up sore, with this huge pit in my stomach that doesn’t go away until it hits me. I also have a very demanding job and am not nearly as productive when I try to go longer between doses. I feel like my job depends on me taking it the most. I certainly can’t go through withdrawals while working, but mostly I’m afraid of the detox. I’ve quit opiates cold turkey before except for this last time when I quit with kratom, now I can’t stop. Is the kratom withdrawal going to be as bad as opiates at my gpd? I’ve recently started cutting back from 5 grams a dose to 4, but I can’t see myself cutting back any more. This hardly does it for me. So I guess I’m more afraid of the mental withdrawal than the physical.

Everywhere from my shoulders and up is just so stiff and kills to move. 

I can’t help but think about how much better taking kratom would make me feel for the pain and for loosening up this stiffness.

I did a rapid taper from about 8-10gpd down to 0 in 4 days and today marks the second day with 0g in my system. So far the day at 2g was by far the worst. The first day at 0g felt like an eternity but I got so much more done than on days when I would be on kratom. It's crazy how we convince ourselves it makes us more productive when the opposite seems to be true.

Keeping busy is hard but im finding the freedom of not needing a dose really nice. Yesterday I did some Christmas shopping and never had to worry about taking a dose in the car or packing some capsules for the road. I think I'm going to be focusing on the freedom a lot to push me through these days.

Day 2 at 0g has been different than day 1. I didn't sleep well and that's definitely affected my energy levels today. I took some advil for a minor headache but otherwise I basically have no serious WD symptoms. I think it's important for me to mention this because I definitely was assuming WD would be way worse than it actually is. I'm a bit cold so I'm dressing really warm but otherwise the hardest part to grapple with is the boredom. We always tell people to take work off while you quit but im realizing I kind of wish I had tasks to do every day right now. Having a full day of nothing is making the quit a bit harder but it's also giving me a lot of time to think about why I quit. I'm 100% convinced I'm not going to use again after all these days. It's just not worth being trapped like that. Boredom is just a sign that I need more healthy activities in my life but it's not a sign that I should use kratom to pass the time. Anyways, I'll end this post by outlining my days:

Day 0 at 2g (last day of taper): very hard, lots of emotions and some crying. By far the worst day.

Day 1 at 0g: surprisingly okay. I was able to go out in public and do some chores. Only a tiny bit of crying but it was minor.

Day 2 at 0g: low energy and boredom. Not much as far as WD symptoms but im being forced to grapple with why I started in the first place - to cure boredom.

I'm on day two, feel like shit, but I also feel great! Never quit anything cold turkey before. I've just had enough with myself and my choices. I am embracing the suck that this is. It could honestly be worse. (maybe it will be? ...bring it)

I got into the doctor today who set me up with proper meds and counseling and I'm leaving Kratom behind for good. I keep a bottle in my desk at work...threw it away today. I have \~600 pills at home...they are being flushed today. I am done with this shit and moving on with my life. Thanks for listening.

UPDATE:
Pills are flushed. I had just over 600 capsules. I no longer have possession of any Kratom and it honestly feels great! I feel like crap, and it’s hard to trust a fart right now, but bring it on. I should have done this a long time ago.

UPDATE 2:
RLS was pretty bad last night, had a hard time getting to sleep. Big deal. I did eventually sleep. Day 3 morning here and feeling pretty shitty, but its ok because that's how I know its working! I no longer trust farts at all.

Personally I have adhd. I got turned away a few times (fuck our shitty healthcare and self serving doctors) and gave up trying to get medicated and so I turned to the internet.  Found several things that kinda worked but kratom really worked well. It reduced my brainfog at the expense of some intelligence/memory and  I was able to keep my dosing low until seasonal depression(comorbid with adhd, lucky me) hit.  I knew it was bad for me...but I really just needed to keep my job. 

Before kratom and after my first high doseage quit I used alcohol to get through, sadly I do need something. But kratom is clearly more addictive. Never had much trouble putting the alcohol away once my SAD let up. 

Anyway, I worked really hard this year on getting diagnosed. Finally starting meds tomorrow and will rapid taper off the kratom over the next week. Pretty excited to be functional in the winter for the first time in years. 

I was totally drug free (including caffeine) until age 22 when first SAD hit and looking forward to returning to that state (except for real medicine).

I drove out to get him. My husband and I stay in a small apartment and don’t have space, my parents aren’t willing to let him stay with them (which is really what I wish could happen, keep him safe and get him back on his feet). He has differences with my parents and doesn’t feel supported by them, lots of trauma and abandonment from them for me and my siblings. He stayed the night on our couch, my mother and I split the cost of a hotel for about a month and bought him groceries. My heart is breaking and I’m not in a strong enough place to support him or help him more than I have. For the first time in idk how long, I sobbed the last two days and felt those feelings. It was so foreign to feel that. But, I didn’t use. Waking up on day 6 feeling drained, exhausted in every way and hopeless to the situation with my brother. I want to fix it, but I know I can’t.

EDIT: Couple of things I wanted to add (1 Day after)

For RLS I took Miraplex, prescription med. It worked with minor to medium rls . I can’t really call it restless legs ,I had Restless Body Syndrome even inside of my head. It was insane. But Miraplex helped me to avoid a relapse. My doctor had no problem giving me 30 , which is more than enough

Also walking for an hour reduced depression by a lot, highly recommend exercise. Key is to be busy, if you have a foggy head do some non mental work like cleaning, dishes etc.

However for the past 2 years I use 3/4 doses of 3g for a total of 9-12g per day. 

If I skip one dose now I get edgy and irritable after about an hour which makes me think quitting is going to be very difficult. I don't feel like Kratom is ruining my life per se, in fact it makes it easier in a lot of ways, but I do have sleep issues and would love to remember what it feel like to be myself without Kratom, even though I like the person I am on Kratom.

I've seen other posts detailing people's struggles with abdominal pain with withdrawals. However, I could use some reassurance since I am a bit of a hypochondriac. 

Since beginning the tapering process (0.5g/day) I've been dealing with what feels like abdominal cramping and spasms, predominantly on my right side. This concerns me since, as many of you know, pain in this region can indicate more serious ailments like appendicitis. While stretching to find relief, my abs do feel tighter on my side. It almost feels like a muscle strain, and sometimes I believe I'm feeling spasms near my belly button and hip. The tightness keeps returning shortly after stretching, and it feels intermittent but regular sharp/burning. At worst it tops out around a 3 out of 10. 

I have no problem passing stools or gas, no fever, and no swollen lymph nodes. I have had more typical withdrawal symptoms like fatigue, foggy mind, general tightness, and diarrhea. All of this is accompanied by this pain on my lower right side. Is this normal, and if so can you describe your experience if you dealt with similar symptoms?

I should also note that I previously had pain in my upper right abdomen near my ribs which has since resolved. Additionally I've felt more fleeting bouts of cramping elsewhere but none have been this persistent.

It feels good for a few months, but then health problems start kicking in. A new one I noticed this time around is hair loss. 

I woke up this morning and looked in the mirror and noticed something odd about my hair. As I was playing with it I looked down at the sink and noticed A LOT of my hair fell out and landed there. I immediately googled ""kratom hair loss"" and it turns out it is very common. It was a relief knowing its just the kratom causing it so I had no desire to take my morning dose. I waited till now (6pm) to finally take 3gs because I was starting to feel the w/ds kicking in. I don't plan on taking anymore the rest of the night. 

My plan is to stay at 3gpd to at least get me through christmas and new years, but then completely CT. I know my dose is low, but I don't want to CT and feel crappy in front of family.

Or not so nice I guess; there’s the food and the bad. Your trying to recover but it’s sad to see how many people this drug has taken over. When I joined 1.5-2 years ago I feel like there was 1/3 of the members maybe 8k I think?

Anyways I’m back at it trying to taper again. My experience has been a cold turkey a year and a half ago with clonidine and gabapentin. A taper without helper meds that was supposed to be 30 days dosed by my parents but I pushed through to speed up the process and ended up making it 21 days. As of now I’m tapering with my parents help again. I’m currently doing 9 gpd today with the help of clonidine and gabapentin. First time in 6 months or so I’ve been in the single digits! I feel surprisingly good but I’ll get to that after diving more into my first couple quit attempts.

My first attempt cold turkey 1.5-2 years ago was rough. I mean it was a brutal hell I wouldn’t wish on anyone. I have no idea why the acutes lasted so long but the restless legs and the insomnia turned me into a almost manic state. The only reason why I didn’t run through a sliding glass door was because I didn’t have the energy to get up and move. I believe the clonidine driving my blood pressure down on top of withdrawals dropping my BP made me more tired. I had a 0.1 mg 7 day transdermal patch. Through my quits I’d go through phases where when I’d stand up my ears would start ringing but go hollow at the same time exactly like a flash bang going off in call of duty. For 1-2 minutes upon standing (I have orthostatic hypotension when I stand up even normally I start blacking out) the ringing would happen and I’d lose about 60% of my hearing or so. I assume due to the lack of blood. I was managing 2-4 hours of sleep the first 12 days then 3-5 hours of sleep the next 4. I made it 22 hours before I took a 6g dose. This was extremely low for me. I was doing up to over 100gpd at one point before dropping it to 36 grams before cold turkey. Then I managed to make it 6 days before losing it and dosing 6 g. Then I made it another 9 days. It wasn’t until the 9th day that the withdrawals finally lightened they didn’t go away but they suddenly went from 95% to 50%. I stupidly started feeling better and decided to get high afterward. It was so frustrating the fact that I essentially had 16 days and was still in acutes. It was really strange and I ll explain why by my next quit. My 21 day taper made me realize I never want to cold turkey ever again. The experience was miserable and almost intolerable but it made the other quit seem like heaven. Nothing too special to not expect the oddities. Maybe it was the fact that my tolerance wasn’t as high but I don’t think so because the cold turkey scared me and I was back to using for a full year. I’ve been using for about 3.5 years at this point by the way. Anyways the strange things were that I had acute withdrawals for only 17 or 18 days while tapering almost the same time as cold turkey. This was without helper meds too. The last 4 days of use I was just enjoying the high and not telling my parents that I didn’t need it anymore. I made it 3 days before relapsing. My quit currently I’m taking gaba pentim and clonidine. I forgot to mention that the gababentin didn’t help my cold turkey withdrawals at all. I mean zilch nada nothing. I was taking 300 mg 2 times a day and 600 at night. I told my doctor  and he suggested I raise it and it didn’t help. He kept having me raise it to the max dose of 900 mg 2 times a day then 1200 at night. When I too it nothing noticeable happened at all. This time i started by just dropping to 16 g from 30 to 50g and tapering a half gram a day now at 9. During the first couple days where the big drop shocked my system I felt some rls and stuff but not even as bad as my first taper and right now my symptoms are completely gone besides back pain when I sit in the car for 8 hours for work. It’s just so strange to me how it went from doing nothing to completely eliminating withdrawals for ct vs tapering.

Day 1-3: Got hammered on the Friday, last day I took my 2g dose, so saturday, sunday and Monday, were the toughest mentally for me, no real physical pain. Just felt depressed but could still laugh and go about my day. VERY SLEEPY going to bed at 5pm waking up at 6am.

Day 3-5: only complaint is diarrhea, I haven’t had trouble with sleeping thus far due to a zopiclone prescription. But that’s almost up, so a little curious to see what happens 

Day 5-9: overall feeling really and dare I say very good some days. Can belly laugh like I used to, feeling an increase in my libido, some tough days but i combat that with some physical exercise.

Tips I can provide

Don’t judge yourself, you don’t need to be back to normal after one week, do what you can, sleep when you want, rest when you can. Do only things that will help you increase your chances at long term recovery. 
I would exercise for 5 minutes lay down for 40, game for 10, lay down for 3 hours. Your schedule will be messed up, but that’s all part of healing. 

If you’re feeling lethargic buy some pre workout take a scoop, but just make sure you’re doing something or the RLS will go crazy.

I’ve never posted here before but I’m curious about what finally helped people make the jump to get off of Kratom. Because I am very near the point where I have to but I am horrified of doing so. 

A bit about myself. I struggled with opioid addiction for three years, and had to quit. Kratom helped me get off of the pills, because suffering the withdrawals from the pills was a horrifying experience for me. I felt the darkest and lowest a person probably could in withdrawal and I have an unbearable anxiety of experiencing that again with Kratom. I have taken Kratom daily for 6 years now to remain complacent, but I fear the negative impact on my health isn’t something I can ignore any longer.

I formerly took high doses of Kratom, largely in capsules. At the height of my dosage, I was a 70-80gpd user. Over the course of a year, I have tapered down to just 7.5-9gpd. I will be halving that dose again today. I am dealing with some ill-effects and concerning allergy-like symptoms (I assume due to the long term regular use and the impact it has had on my health) so I will need to do the jump sooner than later.

I had been off Kratom for about 2 1/2 months before I relapsed back in 2018. I had been omitting this relapse from everyone in my support system for the whole time and it took a lot to finally come clean to everyone. I decided that I wanted to go to a treatment facility as I knew my WD symptoms were going to be bad and I wanted to dig deeper on why I have such a hard time avoiding this substance. 

I am now 9 days sober, and let me tell you it has been a hellish ride after such a long stint on this sludge. My body aches from tossing and turning for hours on end every night. I still have a fair amount of restlessness but it's getting manageable. 

I m happy I went to a treatment facility as I learned a lot about addiction. The idea behind not using is so difficult yet so simple all you have to do is make the commitment every morning when you wake up and say ""I will not take Kratom today"". Don't worry about tomorrow, there's no such thing, just live in the moment, one day at a time, one hour at a time, one minute at a time. 

For me the first day or two of WD is always the worst. Because your body and mind is so not use to the discomfort but as time goes on it starts to normalize and you pay less and less attention to it until it's gone.

I have so much I want to talk about, as I have learned so much in the last week, but not sure where to start. All I know is I want to rejoin this great community as just another support system to help in my recovery and to perhaps give someone else a bit more strength to get off this overlooked substance. 

Just wanted to say hi to everyone and wish everyone a good day and pass on the positive vibes. Life is better without Kratom, feeling uncomfortable is ok, it's part of life. One day at a time. Thanks for being here for everyone,.",31,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.994776725769043}"

If you look back at a lot of my posts It's basically all doom and gloom. And for good reason I can't put into words how much kratom has messed me up, both physically and mentally. And the recovery has been painfully slow. But FINALLY I can make a positive post in pure honesty.

The hair loss has stopped!!! Why it took this long I have no idea. But for whatever reason ever since I've quit my body has been in an ultra sensitive state. Anything that causes me stress in any way would trigger the hair loss among a whole host of other health issues. Eating to much sugar or carbs, getting to cold, not getting enough sleep, emotional stress, basically anything stressful would re-trigger the hair loss. Well finally it has stopped. And I've been pretty stressed recently, been eating my fair share of sugary foods , and it's absolutely freezing where I live. Yet I can barely pull a single hair out of my head! So I can confidently say after the better part of a year, the hair loss phase is over!

I guess I'm just so happy because this means my body is still recovering. This gives me hope that alot of the other weird health issues (physical and mental) I've been dealing with since I quit will heal as well. I can't describe how stressful it's been waiting this long. 9 months of wondering If I've done permanent damage, or if I'll ever fully recover. And the more time that goes by, the harder it becomes. Because you start losing faith that things will get better. This has been by far the hardest shit I've gone through in my life. But finally I have some hope. If your body can heal this far out then I know it's never to late. So for any long term quitters still in the thick of it you should have hope to. It might take a long time, but your body can still recover!

I don't know if it's even possible to describe how much of an impact being clean from Kratom has made in my life. In these last 6 months since I decided to become sober I have moved out of an unsafe household, applied for and started my dream job, started up real friendships and relationships again, and finally felt free. 

For almost 5 years Kratom controlled my life, wherever I went I had to make sure that I had enough dosages. I wouldn't meet with friends after school or work because I had to get home to get my fix. I had no motivation, no drive, and little to no happiness. 

It hasn't been easy, the thought of using again has definitely crossed my mind, especially when things got rougher for me. But consistently I have had to remind myself that this is an addictive substance, this is a drug that I was using, and I am forever better off sober than when I am addicted. 

It does get easier, the first few weeks were rough, the first 3 months were rough, but after the 4 month mark K barely crossed my mind anymore. I finally feel free to enjoy life, pursue my career and relationships without the constant burden of K hanging over my shoulders. It might seem daunting, but please know there are success stories out there.

I originally started way up at 25-30gpd earlier this year, found my way down to an official taper start of 15gpd.  This past week I have been taking 8gpd (my 4th week) - heading down to 6 gpd on Monday.

This week was a bit different.  I got my restless legs the very first night I dropped my dose, and the second night, but then they went away!  I didn't even get the chance to try the Dopa Mucuna, perhaps this coming Monday night in expectation. I've been sleeping without sleep aids.  I'm still stuck on a very late night to early afternoon schedule, but hoping to shift that in the new year.

I no longer have heart palpitations when I lie down to go to sleep.  I have not had a ""hypnic jerk"" for over a week - before I was having them every night, sometimes multiple times.

My appetite for food has been continuing to increase.  I have been making more appointments for myself for various things, and started some projects.  I do find myself missing the ""big surge"" of energy I used to use kratom for, but I expect that's partly due to the season and the big storms we're having where I live and the usual December feelings, and other life stuff.  Gonna keep playing with ways to create and maintain that more naturally.

Hope everyone is doing well.  Keep up hope.  Especially if you're contemplating a taper but feeling scared.  I cannot overemphasize how anxious and scared I was to get started, and how little of a ""big deal"" this has been compared to what I thought it might be.

I was an 8 month user started out with extracts then was up to 20-30 gpd. In addition I had a heavy cigarette addiction and overindulgence in alcohol. My schedule every night would include Kratom, drinking, chainsmoking, marijuana, goodnight. Towards the end of my Kratom stint I had 2 panic attacks where I thought I needed to go to the ER. These however passed. I took some time off work after the second panic attack and tomorrow will be day 9 no Kratom so there is progress. 

I made this account specifically for this page even though I used to be avid on reddit. This community has really helped me out on this 3rd attempt of quitting. I think it’s important to post my experience so others may relate.  

Days 1-3 Crazy night sweats, RLS to the max, some crying, such intrusive depressive thoughts,  bad anxiety, crazy waves of nostalgia which was good and awful, I was appreciative to come back to myself but still didn’t feel like myself and hated who I’ve became recently. I actually slept decent these nights. Night time has been my favorite part of this whole week. Also forgot to mention heart palpitations which still linger on day 8. A lot of depression stems from the disbelief that I just turned 25. Life is flying.

Days 4-6 Such highs and lows. I would feel great and then feel awful. All the symptoms of the first 3 days would come in different waves on these days.I also believe anxiety and depression worsened a few notches on these days. Random heart palpitations as well. RLS still here.

Days 7-8 Flu like symptoms. I was feeling nauseous all day on day 7 then was hit with a brain splitting migraine on 8. I also dosed LSD on day 7 and had such an introspective look at how unhealthy I was while dealing with the flu symptoms. I had some bad anxiety and palpitations here on day 8. Currently laying in bed at 6:00 pm. Probably  from staying up tripping the night before. Not as much of a nostalgia depression, but a what’s the point depression. I’m 25 and have to get my life together depression. I do not recommend LSD.

I hope day 9 shows some promise. I hope I’m through the thick of it. Working out helps when I muster the energy for it. One thing is for sure no more Kratom for this guy.

But in the 16 days since my acutes have passed I’ve caught literally every sickness that I’ve encountered. Literally one cold, one stomach flu, and now a flu. All covid negative. 


I know (way too well) that withdrawals can of course cause flu like symptoms but this feels different, more like being real sick as far as symptoms and consistent duration, and in one of the three instances where I was sick I’d been hanging out with someone who just saw someone with the stomach flu that I ended up with a day later.

One of the things that I love about Kratom was that, for me it made activities that I enjoyed so much better I used to really like to take some kratom and just zone out on my guitar for hours. The thing that sucks now is that I'm finding it difficult to find an interest in the things that I used to enjoy. This is what I struggle with in the present as well. The PAWS or not nearly as bad as they were and my anxiety and depression is gotten much better. There are aspects of my life that improved greatly since I quit kratom one of which is work. I'm more productive at work and I'm more responsible generally speaking in life because I'm not constantly getting high all the time anymore. But I definitely find it difficult finding motivation to get up and do what I have to do when I'm at home. I know I could never go back to kratom and I hope I can just heal. I'm at a place now where I am determined to heal from this drug and what it has done to my brain. I'm not turning back I'm over it.

I’m curious, assuming it is PAWS, would it make sense or be logical to say that the sooner PAWS start, technically the sooner they will end?

My stomach always made crazy noises from Kratom, I was constantly burping, getting hiccups etc. i hoped that since I finally quit it would get better but I’m still dealing with frequent nausea, acid reflux and my stomach making weird noises at times. It’s not as bad but hasn’t gone away. I did have a stroke a few months back and I know your brain and gut go hand in hand, but I’m hoping maybe this will get better with time?

I had been using kratom on and off for a little over two years on an occasional basis. Although the past 3 months I ramped my usage to a daily basis. In that stint it began between 5-10 gpd but the last couple weeks before quitting it was up at 10-25 gpd. My kratom use increased at this time because I had quit other substances I was abusing (benzos, weed, occasional oxy). I am 25 years old and realized that I have been abusing substances for more than half my life. And an honest and critial look into myself, where I am in life, and what feelings I am hiding from with using substance, I decided that I cannot go on living this way. 

I use substances, kratom included, to self medicate for anxiety and depression. More specifically feelings of shame, guilt, deep loneliness, sadness, inadequacy, etc. I have always been looking for an escape from these uncomfortable feelings. But now I know that I need to face these head on and work through them to gain even an ounce of happiness. If at all interested you can check out my past posts where i provide other insights and self reflection

Anyways, day 15 ct. The physical symptoms only lasted about a week. I had slight flu like symptoms - aches, fatigue, sore throat, sneezing. Since quitting, sleep has been hit or miss. I have always had sleep issues my whole life so it is something I am used to. My overactive, overthinking, over-analytical mind keeps me up at night. Perhaps the most annoying thing I am experiencing now is night sweats almost on a nightly basis. This could be in part of quitting kratom, or weening of lexapro (SSRI) since the night sweats started a few months ago as I started taking lexapro and also attempted to quit kratom ct. Now I have started taking wellbutrin and prozac, so that could also be having some effect on my bodily reaction.

Although the physical is not bad, it is the mental that I struggle with on a daily basis. Sitting with my dark thoughts and negative feelings is the worst thing in the world. And it gets so much worse as the sun sets and I sit at home bored, apathetic, ruminating, and wishing I could take something to get away, even if it is temporary. But I have learned time and time again that that is not the answer. It is a quick fix that only prolongs the root issues.

I've quit kratom for almost 1 year and 9 month. The withdrawal was horrible and the first few month were pretty difficult for me due to a lack of energy and motivation for just everything. It went slowly better, but I noticed that my alcohol consumption turned into an unhealthy habit. The first few weeks I've avoided any alcohol because the physical effects were so unpleasant and I was set back every time to acute withdrawal symptoms. After 2-3 months I've started occasionally drinking, but it was extremely difficult for me to stop after one or two beers. I guess my drug addicted personality needed a solid intoxication from time to time and I realized, that I've started slowly to replace the kratom by alcohol.

Than, in November last year my son was born and I've decided to quit alcohol for good. The next month were not always easy, but in fact I didn't miss the alcohol or kratom. For some reasons I've started to drink again. In the beginning only occasionally, but always huge amounts. Since three month the frequency and amounts started to increase until I've started to drink the whole day on weekends in the last few weeks. I never made this before in my life. 

I realized that I had to quit alcohol for good. It seems that I've been trying to fill the gap kratom has left and no abbusive consumption isn't possible anymore.

They were very welcoming & despite how nervous I was made me feel so at ease & accepted.

Within the first year it has helped out wonders and masked the anxiety out of my life on top of giving me motivation and energy BUT day after day, weeks after weeks, of taking more n more kratom and taking less food/water just basically letting kratom control me and become my priority it's safe to say that it has finally caught up to me.

Within the past 6-8 months of taking it I don't even receive any type of benefits from it , it just makes me feel worse even though I take notes mentally and physically reminding myself of the harm, and the repercussions. I've attempted to quit once before and was around 50-60 days clean before I had a random urge and fell back into habit but I want to describe some of the symptoms and hardships kratom has left me that affect ME the most.

\- Uncomfortable Feelings In Chest/Heart as if I have major heartburn or sometimes feels like my chest is shallow and my heart just might stop beating any second, It's a very weird /scary sensation that just feels like a build up of toxins/acids in my diaphragm .

\- Headache/Head Tightness Just 15-30 minutes after taking my first dose ( About 2-4Gs ) or Completely Sober Right When I Wake Up.

\- MAJOR Lack Of Motivation/Energy. I know my body was dependent on it for almost 2 years but I really feel like every single last bit of my natural dopamine and serotonin was replaced and trying to maintain a positive mindset is very challenging and seems impossible sometimes in this current state.

\- Back Pain Like No Other. I'm only 20 years old and this back pain is agonizing sometimes  making it extremely uncomfortable to sit still or sit up with straight posture. 

I was put onto it by a family member and they downplayed the side-effects and never informed me about its addictiveness, If I knew Kratom was a Pain Killer or a ""Mu-Opioid"" I would have never touched it...

I'm at the point that I realize IF I DON'T STOP RIGHT NOW EVERYTHING will just get worst from this point on and harder on myself.

I just want freedom. I still suffer from anxiety everyday which I'm currently seeking medical help & therapy but nothing compares to the mental battle that Kratom has left me in.

I've lurked here a while now, knowing I need to quit.  I've spent a ton of money in the last 2 years and it makes me sick.  You all may not believe this... but the reason I've been terrified to quit is reading your experiences knowing how low the dosage was compared to mine.  Even the supposed high dose posts worried me.  I take 45 .5 gram capsules first on way to work.  And it is every 3 hours from there until I go to bed.  No one knows or has known I use.  Imagine how challenging that is? How lucky ... to not have been caught.  Luck eventually runs out, and I need it gone before it costs me a great woman who would be devastated and betrayed. 

I am flying south to meet her family Christmas eve.  It will be a full house with no privacy and she is flying side by side with me.  While I've hidden successfully my ability to use this presented challenges. I couldn't risk a carry on ...  we are sharing a check bag, and other option is to conceal it with Christmas gifts and mail it ahead. All pose risks with huge impacts.  So I decided I wanted to quit.  Now by my calculation ...6 to 7 doses a day means 130 ish Gpd. Wish I could say I'm bragging, I'm ashamed. I do everything big in life and this is no different.  My biggest concern however is that I won't be able to conceal the withdrawal symptoms.  If being tough and pushing through is all I need to do... I'm strong.  Determined. But if it physically isn't possible I need to figure out how to taper and use there.   It's a conundrum.  

I took my last dose last night 7pm.  So I'm approaching 24 hrs.  Shockingly I'm a little achy ... sure I want it.  Appetite isn't there .... and I'm pounding water because hey it makes me feel I'm doing something good.  

I guess I expected worse so far... but is it yet to come?

I didn’t think there were any negative effects. No hangovers, didn’t effect my ability to work, etc. I started to notice I was getting ridiculously angry at every little thing during the day. I was rushing through work extremely short fused and impatient. Road rage like a mf. Soon I realized that it was because I was trying to get home and do kratom. So I quit 3 weeks ago. The day I relapsed I thought I’ll just take a dose for preworkout to get the stimulant effects should be fine. I ended up dosing two more times that night. The next day I was short fused af reinforcing the reasons I had to quit. As for quitting I did it cold turkey haven’t had any issues I feel much calmer. I do get cravings every night tho.

First time poster, long time browser. I feel like when I first started looking at this page in the middle of my addiction I realized my habit was out of hand. Here I am trying to quit and man.... I’ve been having the hardest time. I used Kratom to help me off off opiates and I’m worse off than I was on opiates after using heavily for almost a year. For some reason I told myself it was better??? However misguided that sounds. But that’s an addicts brain isn’t it? Substituting isn’t hard for me when that substitute also gets me high. Boy do I have a lot at stake. I have a fiancé who loves me no matter what that’s pregnant with our first child. If I’m going to be a good father to him I have to learn to take care of myself. In my mind I can do it all. I eat healthy, work out everyday, go to work, do everything I possibly can to make my girl happy. The problem is, as of right now, not without Kratom. It doesn’t matter if I can do it all if there’s one BIG problem I can’t quit. I have the tools I need to succeed but I lack the strength to do so. Ive been to rehab in 2014 and I’ve lived in a sober living environment, and actually had a lot of time under my belt before. But Kratom has made me forget it all. Made me forget how that felt. Made me forget how to feel. I’m gonna be honest I wish I’d never heard of it. I knew when I was detoxing off opiates and thinking “man this is pretty easy this time” that I was getting addicted again. I need help guys. I really do. I’ve been trying a taper. It’s been going “ehh”. But yesterday morning I woke up at 6am. You all know, sweating, head pounding, weak as hell. I told myself I’m going to go a full 8 hours without dosing and let’s just see what happens. What happened? WOW. I could not move. I did it, but barely. I was really hoping to use that eight hours as a push to go CT but I didn’t. Im feeling down on myself. This stuff has put me in a full blown seizure before and I still do it. It’s almost ruined my relationship and I still do it. It’s put me down in more ways than I can mention but I still do it. I need to break the chain. I need a fresh start again. I need help.

Biggest factor in needing to quit is hair loss. It’s rapidly progressing and seems to get worse by the day.

Went on my phenibut binge about 3 months ago going up to 7 gpd. Currently at 5.5 gpd. Phenibut withdrawal for me is terrifying and debilitating. Completely paralyzes my ability to complete schoolwork, which is not ideal because it’s finals week. Basically I’m in a bind to where I’m running away from kratom hair loss and libido issues, but also I realize that I need to taper the phenibut as much as possible. My social life is failing , my finances are dwindling, and no one knows I’m a drug addict. I’m not trying to throw a pity party for myself because I realize this is a consequence of my actions. But I felt I need to tell atleast something to someone. If anyone has any suggestions on next steps for me in quitting these insidious substances I’d be very appreciative. Should I see a doctor ? Should I confess to my family? Do I taper phenibut first then deal with kratom?

I was taking up to 6,7 sometimes 8 spoonfuls a day for the past two years or so and became always tired, unwilling to socialize and irritable.

The withdrawals haven't been too bad, mainly a feeling of chills and goosebumps constantly with cold sweats that sometimes randomly appear as well. As for the mental health effects of quitting kratom, it's very hard to say since I'm on antidepressants and I also was with friends in a beautiful sunny beach town for a whole week. I do think it helped my mind stay off thinking about it and if I was just at home having out or working, I'd go nuts.

Ever since the 2nd or 3rd day after stopping, music has started to sound reaaaallly good to me again. Kratom definitely kills my interest in music for some reason. I get in a rut of not finding new artists and albums, and stop playing my bass guitar. Now I feel a lot more interested in listening to and playing music. Give it a try when you quit and see if it comes back for you too.

P.S., if anyone wants to comment a favorite album or song they rediscovered , feel free to share. I've been listening to the Aja album by Steely Dan on repeat, I knew a couple of songs but decided to run through the whole thing. It's incredible, give it a go if you're into classic rock or 70s music.  A fun fact about this album is that it's considered to be one of the best quality of production and mixing , so much so that audiophiles will play it to test headphones and speakers out (apparently Rage Against the Machines debut album is another high quality mix) . All of the instruments can be heard clearly and listened to individually, but also all conjoin into one cohesive sound.

I've been using a couple years and my dosing has never been consistent. Let's say 15 and 30 gpd as lower and upper bounds.

One problem that emerged from abusing kratom is that it reduced my threshold for frustration/anxiety/just unpleasant feelings in general.  I'm currently tapering and I find it difficult to determine whether the discomfort is just the predictable response to not numbing myself **or** am I tapering too fast? 

Basically, I think I'm asking for a sanity check. Here's my schedule thus far:

Week 1 - 112 grams total/16 gpd 

Week 2 - 76 grams total/11 gpd

Week 3 - 48 grams total/7 gpd total

I'm currently on week 4 and my doses have been the following:

Thursday - 5

Friday - 4

Saturday - 4

Sunday - 6

Monday - 6

Tuesday/Today - 2.5 thus far, it's around 3:30 pm here. 

I provided averages for the daily dose because it's never been linear. The first day, I recorded 18 grams. Jumped to 15 the next day and then bounced up to 17 the following day. That sort of thing. Focusing on weekly consumption rather than daily consumption has helped me in previous tapers.

Does this seem reasonable? 

My sleep is okay (granted that includes decent doses of cannabis, both edibles and dabs). Mostly just a mixture of fatigue and anxiety, with more physical symptoms in the morning before I dose (chills, sniffles, sneezing, etc.). I went into this expecting to experience some wd symptoms while tapering, but find it difficult to determine whether ""I've dosed just enough to feel normal"" or is this just an effort to rationalize slowing down because I don't want to give it up just yet? Clearly, only I can answer that.

2021-12-14 14:34:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/rgfb6y/terrible_situation/,Terrible Situation,"Using a throwaway to post, I’ve been lurking on and off for years. I’m in a really bad situation, that I got myself into somewhat and others were cards I was dealt. 

I’m not sure what I need, advice, words of encouragement, ideas, or just to vent since I feel as though this group is really non-judgmental. I haven’t really been able to tell my story to anyone in years, a lot of people know parts of all of this, but no one knows everything. I’m sorry if parts of this don’t make sense, or hard to read, I’m writing with intense emotions and crying the whole time. 

I’m a heart transplant patient. My heart failure was idiopathic (unknown reasons, in case you didn’t know. I was in my early 30’s with no known health issues and despite going to the doctor for years with bizarre symptoms, no one put the whole thing together. One night I ended up going to an ER and finally a doctor did an x-ray and discovered my heart ways bloated (size of a football) and barely beating. That night my life that had been very successful, owning businesses, politically involved up to the state level, etc. I was in the hospital for weeks, and finally ended up with a heart pump to transplant. It required me to relocate, making me abandoning everything, so I lost everything. Almost all of my support system was a thousand miles away. I had my fiancé with me, turned wife. I ended up getting a transplant after a couple years, a rare rejection which only a handful of people survive, but it made me stay in a hospital on the other coast due to the very few people that know anything about my kind of rejection. I got it and moved back, but separated while I was on the other side of the country. 

Now for the kratom/drug part. The amount of opioids I had required off and on through this whole process were insane. I had already had an opioid addiction in high school, which I quit CT, and puked for 2 days and stayed pretty far away from those drugs for years. After I was released from the hospital, or after a few weeks laws had been strict about those prescriptions and our medical system is not handling the after effects much at all, if any. So I would be off for a week or few and after each time I would use Kratom to help lessen the pain. It developed into a bad habit (around 30g/day). One time after my rejection, my then wife found my stash, as basically no one had known about until that point. It led to huge tension, partly because I “lied by not telling her” (which I admit was horrible), also because I didn’t clear it with any doctor. Which didn’t cross my mind until she said that, even though you are told to disclose any thing you take. Using substances can lead to not being listed again and other deadly consequences. 

I have quit numerous times, and have gone through acute withdrawals, most lasting 3 days for the worst parts. I stupidly thought I would use for the 2 weeks we had to live together, when I got back, before we could move into separate places. Between my life being torn to shambles in so many ways already, trying to sort out any long term feelings so we wouldn’t live with anger at each other, led to arguments and ripped open scabs. It was painful, but was a healthy step. When time came for her to move, we decided to delay the move for a bit. It’s over a year now, we still live together and have many aspects of a relationship, but no formal status. Which prolonged my usage. I also didn’t disclose to anyone that I still used. 

With money an issue, an upcoming trip together over the holidays, the detrimental things that K does to my kidneys mixed with my anti-rejection drugs, I decided to use the time she would be gone for work Saturday through Wednesday, I would quit. I last used Saturday. And I have had a worse day each since. I started having withdrawals just a few hours after the last dose(maybe my brain and body said oh no, this again). I have barely moved since Saturday, it’s Tuesday. It’s far worse than anytime in the past. I’m severely depressed (no clinical depression, indicated by the numerous mental evolutions from deciding if I can mentally take the tolls of the transplant process. But I do have severe ADHD, discovered during this process). 

I feel like I’m done anyway I go. If she gets home and it’s obvious I haven’t done anything, it will get bad. 1) it will open laziness wounds 2) with these symptoms, she will be pissed as I look sick and haven’t told a doctor

If I tell her why, it will end all connections I have with her. She may tell my doctors, which would end with being booted from the program. If I taper, it will result in this happening on the trip, since taking powder will be obvious what is going on. 

And on another note, I feel like the PTSD that I was told happens with transplant is normal. I don’t even know who I am anymore. I can’t seem to get hired anywhere, despite the 100+ applications I’ve put out. Even places cutting back hours because of lack off help don’t want to hire someone that hasn’t had a “real job” since 2015 (I was finally healthy enough to work till2020). I have to declare bankruptcy due to $100’s of thousands of medical debt, despite insurance. I feel like such a piece of 💩. Sometimes, especially now, the only reason I don’t quit this life is because I feel like I’d be taking the last part of my donors existence.

I wanted to give an update as I feel like a lot of posts leave questions unanswered as most never return to update their experience of quitting. Doesn’t look like I can link my original post so see my post history for reference. 

About a month ago I went in for an endoscopy for some unrelated issues I’d been experiencing. This procedure wasn’t until 2:30 pm and I was required to fast until after the procedure was completed which of course meant no Kratom that morning. To my surprise I made through the procedure and to 24 hours since my previous dose with absolutely no WD symptoms. This gave me the confidence to completely cut out my AM dose. From there I continued a taper with a reduction of .25 grams every 5th day. This continued until this past Saturday. I’d tapered my dose down to .75 grams once per day in the evenings. My wife and I were getting ready to attend her company’s holiday party and I completely forgot to take my dose before leaving. I didn’t even think about it until about 7:30 pm after eating dinner and then it hit me that I missed the dose. With no access to Kratom I decided to see how long I could go without it. Went to bed that night and woke up Sunday feeling perfectly normal. 

I haven’t dosed since Friday night. Today is day 4. I have experienced zero WD symptoms with the exception of some very minor and completely manageable RLS last night when trying to relax. Took magnesium glycinate, vitamin C, vitamin D, NAC, Milk Thistle, CBD and valerian root and all RLS symptoms disappeared. Sleep has been great. I believe I’m one of the fortunate ones to not experience much in the way of WDs but I also believe tapering helped immensely. The fear of WD was sooooo much worse than the experience and had I of known it would be this easy I would’ve quit a long time ago.

Now I’ve tapered down to pretty much nothing as of yesterday and have been consistently having heart palpitations last month, again.. it’s like my heart does little jumps randomly, and my chest feels so tight. 
It’s deff caused some panic attacks and anxiety attacks especially now that I’m tapering off.

I've been a regular user for about 5 years.  The first 2 weren't such a big deal - I could travel without surreptitiously stashing this shit on me, i wasn't hiding bottles around the house and generally didn't feel The Shame.   One thing led to another - a broken leg, depression meds running out, work stress, the energy boost for socialising and exercise; you name it, i have a justification - and for about 2 or 3 years, i'd been at about 30 g/day.  

After coming here earlier this year, I got that down to about 8 g/day over a couple of months - thank you all for the inspiration, I wouldn't have been able to do that without you.

Problem is, I never intended to quit.  Not really, if I'm honest.  Pretty quickly, I was rationalising that it wasn't really any different from coffee and filling in the hole with booze and weed.  Inevitably, it started increasing again and for the past month or two, i've been back at something like 15g/day. 

I'm done with this - the subject came up in a couples therapy session which has landed me with my own therapist and i can't do this anymore. i want to \*\*quit\*\*.  

For the last 3 days i've gone back down to somewhere around 6 g/day.  It's rough.  And different from last time.  The nausea is new, for one thing.  I'm not really getting the sweats yet and the craving feels more psychological, less of a physical gaping hole in my chest, than last time and i'm yet to hit the depression.  Early days I guess.

FWIW, I've seen folks here mentioned vitamin C.  That does seem to be helping some - got some 1000mg lypospheric stuff (which probably doesn't exactly help with the nausea) and reading around, that seems to have some limited success in opioid treatment generally.  I don't know if there's anything to it but I was expecting worse.   The other thing i've seen mentioned is magnesium which i was already taking to help with cramps mountain biking.  Again, might just be hearsay, all i know is i was expecting worse, even at this early stage.

I don't know what kind of timeline to shoot for, I guess sticking at this dose for at least a week or two is all that'll tell me that - I'm not really in a position for CT.   All I know is 1) I want a life without this and 2) hearing y'all's stories is by some measure the thing to get me through this.

 Once upon a time, I discovered these magical little shots at a gas station. I of course needed to find out what was in these innocent little 5 hour energy dupes that made me feel magical & found out it was kratom. So instead of dropping 12 bucks a pop I bought a bag of powder for a fraction of the cost & made “herbal tea”. Never measured consistently just took enough to get that buzz. I like most here thought I found a “magic plant”. It gave me energy blah, blah. I also was about 8 months sober from alcohol so this discovery was like a lay up, this was way better than booze - opiate like effects. 

Until it stopped giving the buzz & I was edgy until I dosed only to have a brief 20 minute comfort followed by chasing daily. It went on for too long. 

Things that helped with the quit. I went cold turkey. Magnesium, Emergencee packets 3x-5x per day first 5 days, multi vitamins & a “opti-greens” which replaced the dosing ritual - mixing the sludge & slamming, outdoor walks, exercise, body weight in water daily & hyland’s RLS tablets, Epsom salt baths & stretching. 

Another thing that helped me is when I was using I imagined what Kratom would look like as a person - and I pictured this creepy voodoo dude (painted face, creepy hat, weird suit). Someone I’d be terrified to encounter that I invited in & made stronger each dose. Anyone else do this? What would kratom look like to you? I’m interested in your response.

Day 4 acutes lifted, day 7 clarity in fact my brain felt like it was on fire in a good way (I forgot how smart I was but I’ve always sought to dull my mental edge & emotions but this time I’m grateful to have them back). You’ll see that removing the poison is like taking off a mental handicap. I hope you embrace it.

Music helps the dopamine, enjoy the happy feelings/ misty eyes. That’s being alive. Also, good old Wayne dyer & louise hays self help talks on YouTube. Reading spiritual books before bed has helped me as well.

I usually take kratom in doses of 2g spread out 2-3 hours during the first half of the day. I always stop during the afternoon and usually have a break of about 12-16 hours where I don't take any.

I've read stories on here where people on my dosage quit CT with almost no withdrawal symptoms. I'm wondering if anyone has tapering strategies that worked for them. I've quit a lot of substances in my life so I'm no stranger to what's about to go occur - I quit a multi-year smoking addiction, a multi-year drinking addiction, and I've even quit caffeine before (I honestly think caffeine is one of the worst things to quit).

Sometimes I can fall right back asleep, other times I'm up for an hour, pass back out then up again in another hour. It's exhausting. Lack of sleep really effects everything for me and I hate that.. but otherwise, IM. GOOD.

2021-12-12 12:52:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/reu7o2/day_39/,Day 39,"Hello all. Not even sure what my last post on here was. Guess I could check, but I'll just forget that for now and let you know what has been going on. 

I took kratom daily for 4 years. Made it 24 hours off kratom one time in those 4 years, and that's it. I got up to 80 grams per day by the end of it. But I was able to quit cold turkey, and if I could do it, so can you.

Days 1-7 were a nightmare for me. I had to come clean to my parents because I knew I couldn't do it on my own. I'm 23 years old and still live at home, so I basically had them keep me on house arrest, unless I left the house with them.

I didn't sleep for the first 7 nights (maybe 2 hours total in the first 7 nights) and that definitely took a huge toll on me. The shaking, the chills, the body pain, the bones feeling brittle, the full body RLS. Shit was horrible. I cried a lot. I had horrible thoughts. I felt suicidal. It was the worst week of my life and nothing comes close. But when things started to get better, it happened a lot more quickly than I thought it would.

Fast forward to day 39, and I can't imagine actually using kratom. That doesn't mean I don't want to, cause at times, I sure as hell think about how great it might be. But I think about how I hated myself every day waking up. Hated myself every night going to bed. Hated myself all day, every day when I used that shit. It made me into a shell of person. My life was falling apart and I felt that there was nothing I could do to stop it. BUT, I PROMISE ITS POSSIBLE TO QUIT.

Don't ever give up. Please don't give up. I came to this subreddit over a year ago and tried to quit, and I gave up so quickly. I went another year without really trying to quit at all.

Now, here I am, seeing the light on the sober side. I feel real happiness when I'm with friends. I have meaningful conversations that were just not possible before. I am more active now, I am gaining weight (which is good because I am 6ft and weighed 170lbs before kratom, 130lbs when I quit, and am up to 145lbs now), I can't sit and watch TV for hours on end anymore (again, kinda sucks at times, but I know it's a positive because that isn't a healthy habit). It's like my mind is craving all the human interaction that I kept away from for so long.  I truly believe that this process is making me a stronger and better person. And I know that my brain is still healing and that things can become even better than they are now. 

I just hope that anyone who reads this, who is currently struggling, can see that a better life is possible on the other side. It might not be an easier life. It's way easier to throw green powder into your mouth and swallow. No one said this would be easy. But it can be better if you don't give up. Even if you can't quit now, don't give up. Don't allow yourself to dig yourself into a deeper hole than you're already in. Keep coming back to this subreddit. Keep talking to people. Keep trying. Keep pushing. You can and will get rid of this nasty shit. Giving up over the last year was the worst mistake I made. I probably went from 40gpd a year ago to 80 gpd, just in that 12 month stretch. And it's because I gave up. And I'm sure that's made my quit much harder than it would have been before.

I know there's so many more details to get into, and I'm happy to talk to anyone who is interested in anything having to do with my use and my quit.

Glad in a way cuz I wanted to stop being a slave to this stuff but I wanted to do it on my terms however idk if that day would come. So maybe this is a blessing after 6 yrs of use 5 of them daily. Started with 6-7g daily up to about 20 for the last few months. I've been thru oxy wd n made it thru w/med assistance. Had K wd before but only as I wait for my next shipment. Most I've gone w/o is 4 days which sucked but wasnt the end of the world as I only had the cravings, moderate rls, anhedonia & sleep issue. I can suffer thru the worst of those cuz I have MDD & GAD n suffer from the anhedonia n sleep issues a lot anyways so I can function. I am so scared of anything that will affect my job as they are micromanaging aholes when it comes to days off. Thankfully my job is work from home n is a great distraction from my usual bs but I'm freaking the f out as i read about the dizziness n vomiting. I know every1 is diff n doesnt experience the same stuff but my anxiety brain goes to worst case scenario n I worry about not being able to do my job. To make matters worse my partner is off work for 3 wks n I was so excited to spend time together as he works so much n then this bs hits. He knows what's gng on n even tho he is neurotypical he is supportive but damn why now? I have faith that this is now my time to stop. Im pretty sure I'm gng thru perimenopause cuz my mood swings been horrible the past few months n I got a lot of the signs of it. So I'm also worried about that making the WD worse. I just hate myself but I know I am a long term addict n whatever makes me feel better or just NOT feel ropes me in n I cant stop n always make excuses to use. I have MJ n a lot of gabapentin left at my disposal so I will use those n hopefully they will help esp since I havent used more than 10 of my 3x 300mg daily script in past 2 months so I pray my lower tolerance to gaba helps.

What was supposed to be a memorable summer stay in a cabin turned into a huge wake up call and living hell. Within 12 hours of my trip my body was going into serious withdrawal from kratom. I had been heavily using at this point for 2 years. I had taken trips here and there in those two years and never experienced what happened in New Hampshire.  I know it was extremely naive of me not to really understand how dependent my body was on kratom.. but I truly had no idea what was about to happen. If I did I honestly would have found a way to bring kratom with me. My body experienced all the most extreme symptoms of withdrawal… sweats, racing heart, dizziness, fatigue, pain in every joint and muscle, unable to sleep. I was in the middle of the woods and my body was completely out of my control…I relapsed coming back to Florida.. out of the shock of it all and thinking I could “control myself” I found myself back in the same habit of drinking the tea… 

Now I find myself not using as heavily but still every day I am warding off withdrawal symptoms with a dose as I notice them coming up. I live in a constant state of fear that if I don’t have it I will go through what happened in New Hampshire. 

I am prepared this time. I have on hand Liposomal vitamin c, DLPA supplements, water, juice, and a sleep aid. This thread has been my most helpful tool in building the confidence and determination to go through with it. I have all week off to quit.

It is the only thing I’ve found that helps directly with it. I NEED to quit though. I started a taper a month ago and am down to half a dose (20g, was up to 40xday) 
I know when I try to come off of it, those intrusive thoughts when withdrawing coupled with my pain is going to make me relapse instantly.
I’m wondering if anyone had suggestions on how to make this taper easier?
I’m about to run out, should I just cold turkey it from here? I’ve never been addicted to opioids/opiates but I had a long stint with alcohol that I finally stopped after ten years of abuse.

This morning I finished a quick 24 hour backpacking trip in snowy conditions and well below freezing temps. It was hell on earth but I fucking love torturing myself like that. Everything was so white and beautiful, just a lovely trip. 


We get back to the car and obviously my body hurts, few peoples’ wouldn’t. And I can’t shake the idea of how amazing taking kratom would be at that moment, when I was super tight and sore and chilled. I mean, I’m a super avid hiker/backpacker, and I ALWAYS take kratom after a hike and I know that it makes me feel like I’m cloud nine at that moment.


Anyways, my friend had some kratom on him and I held onto the willpower to refuse it. But it was quite funny to me — instead, I took some Tylenol, and after I chased it I said to my friend, “DAMN, I cannot WAIT until this stuff hits me.” He started cracking up because I was talking about literal Tylenol in the same way that you would talk about kratom or any other drug. 


It just made me realize that even though I can resist kratom, everything about my kratom addiction besides the kratom itself is still there. And it’s making me kind of wonder if this whole quitting kratom thing is even worth it. Like whether I’m taking kratom or Tylenol or gabapentin or whatever, I’m still an addict as a person.


Idk, I’m not gonna relapse or anything because my practical, long term goals are incompatible with kratom use and I don’t want to jeopardize them, but it’s just hurting me knowing that even though I’m no longer physically addicted to kratom on the surface, I’m still a fucking addict deep down to the core of my psyche. It’s making me feel hopeless and question what the point of this all even is.

I've observed that in shifting each week, Tuesday night and Wednesday night are the worst in terms of restless legs (made another post about that and was happy to hear that other people validated that).  

Starting to notice insomnia getting worse, however.  I have a lifelong history with struggling with insomnia, but there have been periods where I've gotten a better hold on it, particularly a few years ago where I couldn't sleep more than an hour a night for six months.  Since I started my taper, insomnia is getting worse in terms of my ability to fall asleep.  I have to take some kind of sleep aid each night (I rotate them to prevent building any kind of tolerance), and even then, I'm starting to not fall asleep until 5 or 6 in the morning.

What’s gonna be amazing is when it’s christmas time and i’m off of kratom and the prozac should be helping at least a little. LETS GOOOOOOOI",19,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9926748871803284}"

I had neck surgery about 5 years ago to replace some damage. My doctor started me on pain meds about a year prior because the pain was getting intense enough to where I couldn’t do anything. I opted for the surgery to get it over with and automatically felt better and didn’t have to take any more meds but I was scared of the withdrawals of coming off the meds so I did some research and found kratom helped. I started off with small doses of powder and of course the doses gradually became more and more up to the point where I was taking about 8 oz in 3 days. It gave me anxiety a lot of the time but something in my brain wouldn’t let me stop. I was getting to the point where I couldn’t enjoy life because I was so dependent on it. I had to have it if I was leaving the house. Always making sure I had enough with me if I went on vacation or anything else. It was controlling me. It got to the point where I always wanted to be alone so I wouldn’t have to talk to anyone and depressed because I knew I needed off but mad at myself for not being able to get off of it. I don’t. Even want to think of all the money I’ve spent in the last few years. I thought of a plan to switch to capsules to try and ween off of it. I started 3 weeks ago. I started with 10 capsules every 4 hours and the first couple days were rough and I slipped up a couple times but worked through it but got myself on track. I’ve cut it down every week to the point that I’m now down to 5 every 8 hours and I’m starting to feel like myself again. 2 more weeks and I’ll be done for good(hopefully) if I can go from what I was taking to where I am now anyone can do it.

I didn't go to sleep until 4 am but I got a solid 6 hours  night 3. This has never happened in previous quits. 

Woke up this morning in a decent mood. Stomach way more stable today than yesterday. 

I'd have to say Vitamin C megadosing has eliminated almost 100 percent of acutes. I was able to take melatonin and zzzquil (benedryl) last night without getting RLS 

This quit has been the only quit that I havent had any sweats, no chills beyond the occasional cold hands and feet. Maybe 2 or 3 sneezing episodes per day but goes away as soon as I megadose vit c. No runny nose. 

Listen to me now when I tell you vit c megadosing is something truly special. But you have to be all in. I've tried the vit c before on other quits but I made 2 main mistakes that I made sure not to make this time

Mistake #1. I used the absorbic acid Vit c that you can get at kroger. I think the liposomal vit c has been the game changer this round because it doesn't tear up the stomach and is much more absorbable. Get a bottle off Amazon. 

Mistake #2. I ""megadosed"" here and there but not constantly. Previous quits I would take a bunch of vit c at once here and there but I did not constantly load my body up with it like I did this time. This quit was clockwork from the last dose. 5 grams of vit c every 2-3 hours. No questions asked. I also preloaded about a week or two before my last dose.

I did a modestly aggressive drop down to 3, then down to 1.5gpd for the last 5 or 6 days, and let myself run out. Those days were pretty tough, but not horrific. There was mild relief in the afternoon from my single dose, but the evenings were depressing. Sleep wasn't great, but I did sleep.

Since stopping, I've been sleeping better every night. Last night I got a full night's sleep with maybe 30 minutes interrupted and a couple other little wake-ups. I think I missed the acutes with the crash landing at sub 3 for several days. I think L-Tryptophan works better than 5-HTP for pure sleep purposes- at least for me.

I don’t really think that it’ll be too bad but we will see, and either way it always helps to post here just so I can talk about it since I only know 1 other person irl who I can talk to about kratom. 

The first time I seriously quit kratom was this time last year, after 1.5 years of occasional use which turned into another 1.5 years of daily use. I was probably using on average around 8-10 grams a day, so it wasn’t anything too crazy but it was definitely noticeable. I quit for about 2 months, but unfortunately fell back into kratom use. I was using again for around 4 months at around the same dose, and then quit for a good 4.5 months, which is the longest I’ve gone without it since I started. I then fell back into daily kratom use in mid October, and that brings me to today. 

This morning I threw away the kratom that I have. I had a plan to stop today because I want to be past the worst of the withdrawals in time for Christmas (the physical stuff usually lasts around 6 days for me). I still have some finals coming up, but most of them are online or are projects rather than exams so I’m not too worried about it. I do have one in person exam next Friday but I’m thinking I should be feeling pretty good by then. 

Honestly this morning I don’t feel that bad, I feel a bit foggy and tired but that’s also kind of how kratom made me feel anyways sometimes. I’m really hoping that this time will be milder than the other times that I’ve quit, since I took a pretty long break and I’ve only been using for 2 months, usually only taking like 5 or 6 grams a day. I guess only time will tell haha. I had a pretty bad cold about a week and a half ago, so at least I’m already used to feeling kind of shitty, and I doubt that the kratom withdrawals will make me feel that bad. Really the main thing that really sucks about kratom is the insomnia and restless legs, but I have some d8/ cbn gummies as well as some regular flower, so hopefully if I smoke myself silly at night I’ll be able to sleep ok. 

Well if u made it this far thanks for reading.

I had to look at my phone's calendar today and count to figure out how long it's been. I had no idea. Those first few days to week were as memorable as a really bad cold from here, and not much else. Rose colored glasses are a bitch.  But when I was in it; when I was deep in the throws of withdrawals....I needed people who were there with me doing it too. 

I remember sleeping for two hours in a hotel shower because that was the only way I could get my legs to calm down. I remember the 2am visit to the pharmacy trying to find recommended suppliments to help me because I was desperate. I remember convincing my coworkers that I was going through food poisoning so they'd understand my runny nose, chills, and malaise. 

But I remember it like I remember the last time I had the flu. I know it was worse than I remember because I've never needed a support group to talk with all day and night to get through the flu. I remember long, late night conversations with my accountability partner, the other guy in the trenches with me, working to get better at the same time. 

Stay strong!! Find people who are close to where you are at!!! Talk with them!!! Support and encourage each other! Believe me, a 3 year 60-72 GPD habit guy who is now 16 days clean, THERE IS LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL! And it is near!

I am also less helpful to people going through it right now, because the immediacy of the pain is behind me. But I wanted to report this to you all, that it is possible and it is soon that you can recover.

I have stupid chronic pain and the only thing that made me feel like life was somewhat manageable was kratom. I felt like I was better able to ignore the pain, work and raise two young children. Fast forward two years and, well, I still have tremendous pain and kratom still seems to be the only thing that helps. I’ve gone to see about every medical specialist there is. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia but I honestly don’t think that is what it is. This is not the type of pain Tylenol or Motrin help. I’ve been prescribed every neuropathic medication, muscle relaxers and low dose opiates. The only reason I’m thinking about quitting is because I work in a high stress job, and it seems like if I think about anything remotely stressful the sweat just starts dripping from my arm pits. I can feel it running down my arms and rib cage. It’s embarrassing. Multiple t shirts, can only wear black, etc etc etc. If I do anything physical it’s even worse. I’m not even kidding.

My physical symptoms have been pretty easy to deal with. I have noticed a lot of sneezing and slight achiness, but the aches were between roughly day 3-6. Night sweats have been decently prevalent waking up a few nights ago drenched. Been a bit fatigued as well. But the worst part is the mental symptoms I am feeling. A rebound of the anxiety and depression  I have been self medicating with kratom has returned stronger. All my sadness (loneliness, shame, guilt, regret) has been extra prevalent. With the days getting shorter and night setting sooner, its a bit of a double whammy. During the day I am able to distract myself a bit, but when the day ends I am bored, unmotivated and sit with my dark thoughts. My anxiety has also been heightened these days. Worrying and ruminating about life, a very important relationship to me  that  has been under stress these past few months is really effecting my mood right now. I find myself withdrawing and isolating and feeling heavy feelings of inadequacy and shame. I know the heightened state of all these emotions will pass sooner than later, but they will still be around, but at least i will be in a better mental state to work through them.

Cravings for kratom and other substances are certainly present. Just anything to get a bit of relief from the mental anguish i feel. I have had issues with other substances in the past and have mostly quit those, kratom being the last one i needed to stop. So now I am truly facing my demons head on with no distractions from substances. It is a good feeling because i know I am making progress, but let me tell you it is scary and not easy.

Got a question for the group if anyone has any experience on this, id greatly appreciate your insight. 

For those who have not been following my daily check ins, I’m in the process of tapering and plan to jump in about two weeks. 

I just found out I’m going to have to have a root canal for an infected tooth. Unfortunately the antibiotics aren’t fixing the issue. I’ve never had a root canal but I understand it is a fairly in depth process. I gather that there are some heavy sedatives and maybe even opioids that they use to do the procedure.

My concerns is this….. I want off Kratom and don’t want anything to do with opioids that may set me back progress wise. I will talk to the doctor about this very thing but was curious if anyone here had experience in going through this while trying to get off Kratom. If if I tell them not to send me home with pain meds, will the drugs they give me to do the procedure set me back? Any thoughts, experience or encouragement?

Appreciate it.

Edit:

Just read a Reddit article on root canal and it sounds like it’s not as in depth as I was told. Pretty much like a cavity as far as just numbing the jaw.

Fatigue is starting to go away and things are slowly transitioning towards where they're supposed to be. Recovery is very possible and my advice to everyone is: Don't downplay kratom!

Kratom is illegal here. On November 9, 2020 I was finally out and after 6 weeks of horrible insomnia, RCS\*, depression, came out. (I had used for close to 9 years, I think, capsules only, 60 caps per day).

I've posted my sober progress here occasionally but I did always caution I wasn't sure how I'd handle going back to visit the USA, doubting I could resist buying and using. Let me tell you, removing yourself from access (it can't even be mailed here) and 5,000 miles away from it, is the only way I could stop.

In early October, I went back to visit the USA and before I did, I ordered 2,000 caps from an old vendor, so it was waiting for me. And I just took the last one last night, after somewhat tapering down. I have to be honest, I have mixed feelings about using after 11 months clean. I really liked it, it killed joint achies, I slept really well, etc. But I knew this day was coming, too.

Going into this knowing my w/d might be right up there with last year's because I used so long historically. I dread the RCS the most.

I know most get Restless Leg Syndrome but for me, it's \*Restless Clench Syndrome. I spontaneously clench from my neck down trying to sleep. On/off. thrash, again, etc etc.

I wanted to post because maybe some of  you get in the same situation, you live somewhere Kratom is either not available in general, or illegal. I mostly wish I didn't buy/use it again.

Just took some kratom and pulled over to the side of the rod to finally write you all. I’ve been nervous about posting since I started following a couple of months ago, not sure why.
I’ll keep it short and sweet. I’m looking for a little advice and a little knowledge of what to expect in my current situation.
I’ve been a user since February 15 2021. Fairly new to this gunk. I’m an ex alcoholic who has been hospitalized about four times with acute pancreatitis. Once I found kratom, I thought it was the magic ingredient to living a sober life. 
Now I’m living paycheck to paycheck, checked out of all the activities I once found joy in, and looking for a way out. My weapon of choice are the extract shots. As of about a month ago, I would say I average three - four shots a day (sometimes I pour a couple drops out)
My work ethic is slowly going out the window, I don’t feel strong emotions, I’m always thinking about the next dose even if I don’t want it, I can’t perform sexually with my girlfriend, I am constipated, I am going broke, I have what appears to be very little self discipline, I lie to myself daily, I lie to my friends, and all of this because I enjoy the feeing of not feeling. I’m diagnosed OCD. I’ve been medicated on Effexor since I was 15. I am now 30.
I reached out to my doctors and they offered three things. Methadone, subs or gabapentin. I chose gabapentin because why would I want another addiction?
Unfortunately when it came time to cut it CT, I was too nervous and decided i couldn’t quit yet. My depression and anxiety get bad over the holidays. A couple of years ago, I was prescribed Percocet for surgery and when it was time to stop taking them, my OCD and depression sky rocketed. It was bad. Non stop crying. No way out. I’m worried this will happen to me again. What should I do guys and gals? Any advice? Should I try to taper off and start using just two shots a day? Should I suck it up and CT?

(Slow taper, down to 10g/day)","Hey - I know we don't need to personally check in in our own posts each day, but I wanted to share this  to provide bright spots for those in need.

I'm on Day 16 of a slow weekly taper, I'm down to 10g/day, down from 12 last week and 15 the week before.

I'm not sure why, but the past two days I have been feeling more energized and better.  Not all the way there, but there's some marked changes in my ability to get some things done AND the feeling I'm having about them.

What I attribute this to is that maybe my appetite and sense of hunger is coming back now that the amount of kratom I'm taking has decreased!  Not eating was a huge problem for me.  I didn't eat much food while on kratom, especially for the last 6 months or so during which time my usage was as high as 25-30 gpd.  I used to be one of those people that would get ""hangry"" if I skipped a meal, especially breakfast, but kratom became my breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and my appetite disappeared.  I would usually make myself eat late in the evening before I went to bed.  It was so strange to me and it took me awhile to connect the dots.

It's very obvious that not eating any food, particularly nutritious food, is going to put the body in a very ""down"" state and make it hard to concentrate or motivate.  This weekend, at the urging of a coach who helped me prioritize some steps, I finally said, ""f\*ck it, I'm just going to get some calories in my system and I'll go for the most appetizing stuff possible with a LOT of fat.""  I went to the grocery store and bought Ben and Jerry's and some potato chips and thoroughly enjoyed them.  Ate another pint of ice cream yesterday and a nutritious dinner (I allowed myself the indulgence of a meal delivery service during this quit process and there are some pretty great ""specials"" around to sign up for them at this time of year).  Today I ate my breakfast, did errands, went and worked out, and when I got home from working out, I was actually HUNGRY!  I ate a sandwich, and I'm still hungry!!!  Got a meal delivery service meal waiting for me for dinner tonight.

Remembering to eat, even if I don't feel like it, is my personal bottom line right now and I'm hopeful that after a few more days of this I'll experience even more motivation to get back to things like walks etc.  I've also been pretty consistent with my supplements and herbs (I take a lot).

I know there will be many ""windows and waves"" to come, but I'm grateful to actually be able to feel my appetite again and wanted to share this bright spot.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9869816899299622}"

I got up from my desk and started pacing towards the bathroom. 

Now the panic set it in. I was dizzy, had blurred vision and was almost going into convulsions. eventually got outside and walked to my nearby apartment.

I just want everyone to know that it’s very, very possible to escape those shackles of the dark dungeon that kratom imprisons you within. I had attempted to quit many times throughout those 4 years of use. Sometimes I made it a day without kratom, and sometimes I made it a month without it, I even made it 5 months without dosing one time, but I kept going back. The acutes sucked, but were always very doable. The PAWS however was the worst nightmare of my life. Absolutely awful anhedonia, depression, anxiety, you name it. My brain would always tell me that this was how I always felt even before kratom and that I’d never feel good without it. That however proved to be a lie, and it wasn’t only until I decided to “trust the process” as they say, that I was able to push through to the other side. In other words, do not trust your brain during the initial healing process. It is damaged and isn’t functioning correctly, which results in the intrusive thoughts, rationalizations, and straight up lies that you tell yourself. Time, exercise, human connection, hobbies, and good diet I have recognized as my best tools throughout my journey, but mostly time. I also had to rebuild my life and fill the void that had been created after removing kratom. An exciting/rewarding job, exercise, and closer connection with my family and people around me did just that. I always emphasize that quitting kratom is a long journey that can’t be half-assed. You do have to be very committed to it, but once you are it is very doable. This is becoming really long, but I just wanted to share as much as I could that could possibly help someone else.

The idea of getting through a day without getting high on something feels impossible. I started seeing a therapist 6 months ago. A doctor had suggested I might be autistic so I started seeing a person who works with autistic youth/young adults. I didn’t tell him about using drugs. I don’t know what the hell I expected, but somehow I thought that was an ok choice.

I’ve realized I can’t talk about anything with him because so many of the problems in my life come back to using drugs to cope. He’s such a wholesome kind man, I don’t know how he will react if I tell him. I worry he will be extremely angry with me for being dishonest for so long. I already feel like he dislikes me, so I worry this will be what pushes him over the edge. I tend to be too extreme about things like this, so I’m hoping that he will react well but I don’t know.

Started out by combining it with OJ, but after I started to gain weight from the sugar consumption, I eventually switched to the capsules. 

I had one break from Oct 2018 to Feb 2019. I moved cities with my family in between those months and the constant stress and activity of the move actually worked to help curb the cravings. I found myself quite surprised that WD's didn't really hit all that hard.

But of course I got bored and picked it back up again. Since then, it's become a daily habit. 

I was up at around 20-25 gpd at my worst, and I've got it knocked down to 6/day now. I would love to quit CT, but I just feel like it's not fair to my wife and 3 year old to see me as an irritable mess. And my job is extremely high-intensity (promotions and marketing for local TV).

So I’ve gone from 40 GPD to 20 GPD. My plan is to continue to drop one gram per day for the next five days, bringing me to 15 GPD by next week. After reaching 15 GPD, I will probably slow down my taper a bit and spend a few weeks getting down to 5 GPD. Once there, I will possibly jump, if I feel up to it.

The thing that’s helping me the most right now are AA meetings. I have gone to one meeting a day for the past 6 days. It helps keep my mind right and motivates me to stick with this taper. I am currently unemployed, as I quit my horrendous job last week. Obviously this is helping me stick to my taper schedule, because I don’t have to worry about working a job with withdrawal symptoms.

Night 2 was a bit more difficult. Night 3 I was drunk so sleeping came easy, but I woke up earlier than i wanted to. Sleep last night was again difficult. I could not slow my mind down and relax. I felt this sensation, which i felt on night 2 as well, where it feels like my spine is crawling and my nervous system is on edge. It is a very unpleasant feeling but I cannot describe it accurately. I have also been having night sweats. It was strange lastnight because on top of the crawling feeling, I also felt cold, but woke up sweating a few times.  My psychologist prescribed me Doxepin for insomnia after seroquel didnt seem to work (I have pre existing sleep issues either exacerbated by or caused by depression and anxiety). I don't feel that the Doxepin has helped me sleep at all. I am hoping that whatever kratom withdrawal I am going through is counteracting the doxepin and that it will help in a few days/weeks when my body and mind are back to baseline. Physical symptoms are almost non existent, except for that strange sensation i felt these nights. The majority of the ""withdrawal"" is rebound anxiety and depression.

My question is - what do you do while you're in anhedonia?  I'm definitely not used to being so bored, and I'm not working right now so there isn't much ""to"" do.

I'm sitting here listening to podcasts and watching TV, but I've been doing that for SO long.  I have a great exercise bike right here in my room and I ""just don't feel like it.""  I know a lot of folks will say ""just make yourself do it"" - but that's exactly what doesn't ""work"" right now.  So how did you ""trick"" yourself into doing something?

Someone else said ""listen to upbeat music...""  what music did you listen to?  Did anyone make a playlist?

It would be great to put together a list of resources / suggestions for anhedonia activities.  I might be able to help pull something like that together, especially if I know it's wanted, and it might give me a purpose.

Definitely wore myself out, but got home and just been in a funk.  Legs are trashed from running my ass off all week so I'm forcing myself to not run today.  Upperbody is sore from weights and the work this morning.  Basically physically wrecked, in a good way, but mentally wrecked, in a bad way.  In a funk to say the least...

Meeting with a friend for coffee before my recovery group today, but time is CRAWLING haha.  I am happy to be 15 days (logically) but I feel no sense of accomplishment.  Instead im thinking about all the things I should be doing, or should have done, but I just lay here wishing I could run.  

PAWS...another 4 letter word (acronym I know).  I know once my night begins with coffee and socializing I will feel much better...I KNOW this...but waiting for it is literally torture right now.  

Im not feeling like using at all, but I know that if this paws keeps up like this, I will start to romanticize drugs.  Any and all.  Dont drink anymore, no appeal really.  Don't smoke weed anymore, no kratom, can't exercise.  I NEED DOPAMINE! 

My brain is healing, and I do feel better than useless like the first few days, but at least fighting the intense acutes gave me something to focus on.  I dunno.  Im sorry for not sharing more positivity guys...I really am.  Im just struggling right now really bad and need to write this down and share it before my mind wanders my body to the shit store.  

Just writing this down gave me the motivation to do some yoga.  Thanks for reading, and again, sorry theres no positive emotion in this post.

I had a successful 7 day CT quit a couple months ago when I realized that although it made social anxiety better it prevented more meaningful connections. but I relapsed from a panic attack that I suspect was induced by adderall.

I have been lurking here for years, reading and learning and preparing. Just yesterday, for the first time, I made a bunch of posts trying to get ready to quit. Well, I have finally jumped CT. I’m 9 hours in right now. Onto my plan and details so far:

I have been using for about 5 years. Over the first 3 years I ramped up from beginner doses to about 45-50 GPD, then about 2 years ago I cut back to 35-40 GPD, and have been there since then. I toss and wash powder. I never did extracts or anything like that.

I decided to do the Vitamin C mega-dose protocol. I have read that it works EXTREMELY well for about 50% of people, and after trying it yesterday, it definitely works for me. I took 5,000 mg and within 30 minutes I felt amazing. (Please feel free to ask me more about this protocol.)

It’s currently almost 3:30 pm, and I took my last dose at 6:30 am. I’m over 1/3 of the way through day 1. I don’t think I’ve ever made it this long before. I’ll be taking 4-5 grams of the Vitamin C every 2-3 hours until bedtime. I’m supplementing with a multivitamin, DLPA, a GABA supplement, an adrenal health supplement, and a sleep aid of Magnesium glycinate.

If I make it through tonight, and reach the 24 hour mark, I think I can do it all the way. The lack of sleep is by far the worst part for me, because it exacerbates the anxiety. I happen to have a pretty slow work week, and I work from home, so that’s a plus for sure. I definitely got lucky, because I was NOT planning to go CT today like this. It just kinda happened, and here I am.

Please, send me some encouragement, and I’ll do the same!",10,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9146997332572937}"

Another attempt to quit the red white and green weasel,"We all know that quitting kratom is difficult. Just so uncomfortable. Aches, pains, RLS, mental anguish, anhedonia, bathroom issues, and so on. But as I mentally prepare myself for this new year's attempt, I can't help but look forward to the positive aspects. For example, about a week in when music starts to invoke emotion again, saving money, thinking clearly, etc... I have to say, in a way, upon approach I'm kind of looking forward to it. Of course, the RLS and insomnia will most likely crush my spirits after the first few days. But hey, It has to stick eventually right? I mean we can't go on forever like this. I almost left it behind this year but I found it hard to not surrender to my alcoholism due to the absence of Kratom for a few months. This year I've set up psychological therapy to compliment my own will power. I'm not a big believer in therapy but I'm desperate to get past this nonsense that I keep putting myself through. Anyhow, I'm back and determined to kick the weasel. I've had enough. Glad to see I'm not alone.

I've been using for about 7.5 years, with a few short breaks. I'm 34 now, and have undoubtedly wasted some of the best years of my life with this false friend, but better late-ish than never. Time to be all the way done. I've got 5g left in caps to assist with the crash landing, and no inclination to re-up. It's been a rough week-and-a-half, but I'll call it a blessing-in-disguise when all is said and done. 

I remember reading accounts of people with 7 years of usage when I was 2-3 years in, thinking to myself 'ehh I'll have stopped by then.' Well- 'beware' from your future self.

I'll try to keep this pithy:

I'm down to 3gpd for the last three days, with that small amount just to make sure I get a little sleep. I've got a new job starting next week, and I'll be working with my new manager a couple times this week- I can't be flop sweating and in a full-blown brain fog. I'm thinking 2-2-1 for the next three days should be enough to keep me on the rails.

I've been keeping it low lately- 10gpdish other than the weekends, which have been substantially worse. 

I know it's not going to be all that bad- I've always been pretty lucky with withdrawals, whether because of general constitution or largely healthy eating and exercise patterns, but it's still difficult to say goodbye. It can take a long time to realize what the cost of this stuff really is- it's subtle, and it feels like a free win. A little, bubbly boost, with no downside. 

You don't notice your foggy memory, or that you've mostly lost interest in music and activities, or that you've mostly lost interest in people. You can get by reasonably well- or it's easy to fool yourself that you are, anyway. There are no free wins with daily drug abuse, and kratom is, counter-intuitively, one of the most pernicious.

The cost is high, and as I've skittered in for this rough and sloppy landing, I've started to realize just how high it is. How I can't get the things I *really* want, because I'm sneakily holding out on my 'it's just a little bit' usage pattern.

Anyway right after US-Thanksgiving I got sicker than I've ever been as an adult, and I count myself lucky for it- 5 days of abject misery, coughing and stuffed up. No better time to quit- I felt worse during those 5 days than I will at any point through the rest of this. Threw away all my nicotine vapes too- good riddance. Was still vaping with a nasty cough... anyway, this is not that sub.

I'm excited. Crying about music, and feeling the sparkle again... I'm sure many of you have been there.  Also, even just staying low the last month or two, my hair looks *much* thicker in the front. Like, I saw a picture from four years ago, and I appeared to be straight-up balding. Thick and full now. If you're worried about that- look no further than kratom.

It's bad too, of course. I'm a little anxious- occasional waves of depression, though short lived, are perhaps the toughest. I've got tachycardia and have for years- I'm hopeful it'll clear up, but I don't expect that in a week. What a thing to ignore...

I know I, my mom, my girlfriend, my psychiatrist, and my family would be disappointed in me. And why would I think that, if I failed to use successfully the last 2 times, this time would be different? 

I keep getting thoughts like ""if you want it so bad go do it and see how shitty you feel"" but that's my addictive brain trying to rationalize things. 

Any suggestions on kicking that ""warm and nice"" feeling toward dosing again once you're through withdrawals? It seems to be the hardest part for me by far.

I started using kratom at the start of quarantine just out of boredom. It quickly got to the point where I felt like I couldn't do certain things anymore without it like working out, cleaning, socializing. So far, this week has not been so bad as I feared it would be. I have managed to get myself to do these things, and it wasn't unbearably boring. I also haven't had the terrible anhedonia and suicidal thoughts I had the first time I tried to quit, which is my biggest concern. I kept telling myself that my brain was playing tricks on me as the drugs left my body, and I was right. I was using more back then, but I'm still pretty afraid of those coming back. So far just feeling a little sick and irritable and of course the night sweats and a little RLS, though I find as long as I take Magnesium before bed RLS can mostly be avoided.

On the positive side, I look less 'deathly' in the mirror already. I have to admit my vanity is what got the best of me. I could no longer deny that my hair was getting thinner. My skin and eyes and hair are all so dry! But my eyes look clearer already, though they kind of hurt. Like the feeling you get when your eyes are tired because you didn't wear your glasses all day.

I got to sleep just fine and slept through the night. Day 2 (yesterday) was a bit tough in the mental department. The anxiety and depression, which i was self medicating with kratom, came back pretty strong. I found myself ruminating and thinking negatively. I have a lot of stuff going on in my life that I need to work on, and yesterday was a day in which I could not get my mind off of it. I had to go to work (server/bartender) and my brain wasn't working. Making stupid mistakes and just not being cognitively sharp. Felt like I was going to have an emotional breakdown and that I would have to leave work. But I did not.. I stuck through it and made it home in one piece. Again at home, when I was trying to get some sleep, the anxiety and depression was pumping. At one point I felt like  my spine/ nervous system was on edge and crawling. Hard to explain, but very uncomfortable. After about 2 hours I was finally able to dose off and get some decent rest.

Today, I feel OK. Of course still heavy depression. The anxiety is alright at the moment but it comes in waves, so I wont be surprised if it creeps up later while I am at work or tonight when i try to get to sleep. Physical symptoms have not been bad thus far and I don't expect them to get too bad. I have gone cold turkey a few times recently for about a week and never had terrible physical symptoms. Its the mental that is tough for me and why I crave to use kratom... for some alleviation.

The anxiety is almost missed at this point, strangely enough.  Guess it was more like mania, which I know is part of the process, and not how I want to feel permanently, but the boredom and anhedonia are pretty brutal today.  Not going to use, just gonna fake it today, and for the foreseeable future mostlikely.  

Gas station ran out of the vapes I like so I made the dumb decision to grab one from the smoke shop I bought my shots from.  The guy there (muh boy Sonny, miss him honestly but not the kratom haha) walked straight to the shots and said how many today.  I said none and felt a sense of pride, but also felt kinda bad because maybe he became reliant on the thousands I spent there...not bad enough to cave haha this ain't charity, but that feeling and thought did happen.  

Thats empathy.  Thats a good sign I guess.  Also a good sign I had zero desire to grab any shots or powder.  Like zero.  I understand its a bad idea to put myself that close to the shit that has destroyed, and I will continue to buy my product at the gas station that doesn't sell any kratom, but I ain't ready to stop nicotine yet.  Not even considering it until this quarter at school ends.  Big projects coming up, and while I hate being dependent on a substance to power through...its better than smoking pot, taking kratom, coffee, AND nicotine.  Down to half my addictions..no kray no weed...just nicotine and caffiene.  

I have the whole winter break (monthish) to get off nicotine, and my caffiene intake is 1-2 cups a day which i dont think ill ever feel the need or desire to quit.  I've gone periods with none, and periods with way too much, so I figure a small/moderate caffiene habit is safe for me.  Some research say its even healthy?  Who knows who sponsored those studies though.  A little ain't gonna harm me or shit would be age restricted.  Maybe not haha.  As you can see I got hit with some racing thoughts being that close to kratom shots.  Still no desire to use, but def got me racing.  

Gonna smash out a 45 minute wim hoff/meditation.  Today's a much needed rest from running which sucks, but I gotta practice not ""escaping"" with endorphins as I've noticed it just perpetuates my hoodini magic tricks of escaping any and all things.  Probably a few rounds of yoga as well.  And just rest.  Not going to pressure myself to do ANYTHING today except rest.  Probably the toughest task I could imagine, honestly.

I'm an addict in recovery. A poly addict I should add. A year ago I was just starting my recovery from stims. Specifically benzedrex. I've made a ton of progress. But the only thing left in my life now that was from my active addiction life. Is kratom. Now don't get me wrong. Kratom has helped me legitimately in so many ways especially when I started recovery. But at this point it has become a burden. After reading a bit here it seems like a lot of why I feel the way I do now is because of the kratom. I guess I didn't want to admit it for a while. My depression on its own is bad. But usually I'd still have some personality. Now I have nothing. I'm monotone all the time. I'm almost never happy except for 6 hours a day. 2 hours after my morning dose. 2 hours after my afternoon dose and 1-2 hours after my night time dose. Outside of that I sit here or at work. Thinking of when I'm gonna take my next dose. Counting the hours. Wondering if I made a mistake and actually have to take it an hour before I thought. Meanwhile that's really just me not wanting to wait to take it.

Idk it feels like my life revolves around kratom. I'm addicted to it and dependent on it. I'm on a stupid high dose. About 63 grams per day. Recently I've been lowering that. I'd say it's around 55-58 now. I also made the jump to a lower quality kratom to reduce the total alkaloid content in my blood and brain.

One thing I noticed with kratom. Is that when u first start taking it it feels like you're a new person. Or the person you think you should be because the person u were before you took it was undesirable to you. Or I guess me in this case lol. But then as with all drugs, in time it becomes less so until you're just taking it to feel somewhat normal. But I don't even feel normal when I take it. I feel like my thinking ability is slower it feels like it's hard to piece together coherent thoughts especially if I'm upset. I find that I hide my feelings more when I take it. Hide them from others and myself. And I my recovery I don't think that's good anymore. Or ever really was. In the beginning kratom was what gave me the motivation to work and be normal when coming off of some pretty heavy serotonin drugs that definitely messed up my brain chemistry for a long time. And tbh I'm still recovering from the damage. And now I feel like kratom has played its part but I feel it is time to say goodbye to this sludge I drink everyday.

No way will I do cold turkey cause I have to like. Do work and stuff lol but I'd like some advice on tapering.

But starting off, I figured I would go a little quicker, so I’ve  been dropping 2 or 3 GPD each day this week.  Now I’m down to 30 GPD with some discomfort, but it’s doable.

I just really didn’t feel like waiting after each drop to stabilize because I’m in such a damn hurry to be off this poison. I’ve never done well with tapers, but this time around is different. It’s different… because I’ve started going to meetings.

I had never been to an NA meeting before this week, but I figured it couldn’t hurt so I looked one up and went. It was so inspirational! I even opened up to one of the guys I sat next to about my kratom use and I was shocked that he knew precisely what it was. He said some of his friends had gotten addicted. 

Last night I went to an AA meeting (I’m also an alcoholic who’s been in recovery for 7 years), and it was no different. I felt so galvanized to continue with my quit after walking out of there! 

I know meetings aren’t for everyone, but they’ve been super helpful for me. I’m going to continue to attend one per day for the duration of this quit. Hopefully they will continue to keep me focused for the rest of this taper. It’s going to be a long slog to the finish line and I’ll need motivation to keep me going.

I responded amazingly well, 1.5grams would have me ride a warm euphoria for up to 12 hours.  I kept track of my intake on a google sheet and my use up to and including september was around 3 gpd.

In oktober I had a nasty episode of ptsd nightmares/horror and lots of anxiety/depression, so I upped my dose gradually until I sat at 15 gpd for little less than 2 months. I was feeling great again, sleeping for 8 hours when combining with about 50 grams of kava a day.

Then a few weeks ago suddenly kratom just completely seemed to stop working and I started feeling bad. I decided I needed to taper down to 0 and have at least a few months of to reevaluate my condition. I hate not knowing if the kratom was just faking my mental progress. 

5 days ago was my last 15g day and the day after I went to 8, then a few days at 6, now 5. I'm very very surprised how hard this is hitting me. Chills all day, my core hurting, not being able to sit still, feeling like absolute trash, insomnia and my depression/sadness reaching all time highs.

I ran out of kava too which is a major bummer since I live in the EU and the shipping/customs takes like a month+. I'm hoping to stabilize on 5 for a while so I can get work done and then mid december I have 2 weeks off work at which point I'm going to jump. I just really hope I have my kava by then. 

My doses sound ridiculous for the amount of bullshit this is. I dearly wished I could have gone back and tell myself to have days off and never go above around 5 gpd.

I've been taking kratom about 3-4 months throughout my pregabalin taper, but now need to come off it. I cut to 2g x 3 a day (6g day total). I've been reducing each dose by 0.1g and today have reached 1g x 3 day, so 3g total.

When I came off kratom before my taper was completlely different, I was only dosing once a day in the morning and by the time I got to this level I just jumped. My risk here is that I'm only 7 days off pregabalin and I don't want anything to destabilise that.

I'm thinking I just keep reducing at 0.1g per dose? And be off in 10 days. Or do people think I can jump sooner. I don't want to drag this out, I'm already getting withdrawal symptoms especially RLS at night. If I'm going to get them anyway I may as well get on with it.

A lot has changed in my life for the better since quitting, and man it feels good! I still have to remind myself why I quit, what it felt like being dependent on kratom, and how it threw a big wet blanket on my emotions. Something that has helped me keep hitting milestones is to reward myself. Sometimes it is physical things that i want, other times it is more of an experience like a weekend getaway. I'm into tattoos and got a piece that commemorates that period in my life. I see that tattoo every day and get a little more attached to it while I give myself an internalized high-five.

I've had a couple times of really wanting feel that buzz again. Today I had a strong urge to do it for some reason. It's not an overwhelming feeling. It's a mild craving, but going to a head shop and picking up a small bag has crossed my mind several times. I won't do it. Just sharing the feeling with folks here that can relate. 

Something about this substance, or maybe quitting substances in general is that it is such a big ordeal while you prepare and eventually go through it. Days, weeks, months go by. You look back and think ""yeah that kind of sucked, but it wasn't that bad and I feel so much better now"". Nobody seems to ask how it's going with that struggle after so long, if at all, but you still get your celebrations with yourself, or on this sub with others going through the same thing.

I've been with depression and mania since high school. It was after high school I began using drugs recreationally. Time goes by, after experimenting a lot, I throw away most of my drugs. Kratom stays; my inner dialogue will claim that it is the only reason I was functional during a particularly long depression. Without kratom, I see myself committing suicide. Time continues, and I begin experiencing health problems. I'm rational enough to acknowledge that kratom has consequences, like every other drug, so I begin to ""think"" about quitting and what that would entail. This seems to be where I'm so plainly stuck.

I know what I'm like without kratom, and I know it's possible. I can smell for instance. My countenance reflects my emotions to a far greater degree. I become more critical in my analysis of things: less agreeable towards what's naturally unattractive towards me, like procrastination. None of these facts seem to be enough of a reason to live sober. I don't really know how else to communicate this feeling effectively, except that how it feels will logically follow action to suicide. I've been sober for perhaps up a month, and that feeling gnaws on my psyche until I condemn my health and confidence etc in substitute to pollute my mind and body with a 6 hour long high.

Diarrhea. It really multiplied the problem that was already a part of withdrawals for me, so I wanted to give this quick caution for folks looking for healthy supplements that can get them through those rough first days.

So the first few days I would eventually pass out for about 2-3hrs but yeah last night I actually slept from 11p-6a.

I quit cigs & alcohol the same day. I'm still drinking coffee.

But I'm actually alone most of the time and deal with depression but I really think is circumstantial. Like I flat out need to see my family. I'd actually really like to move even. There's just a lot that I can't control or change because I'm married.

I got so tired of being numb to life, not being a good partner, not being a good friend and family member. I’m willing to suffer the discomfort to get a life back. Here are a few things that have been helping me in my quit….

• long cold shower with wim hoff breathing. 

• Forcing myself to go and do things out of the house. 

• Walking out in the fresh air. 

• Hot bath before bed.

• Kava Kava! 

• playing music.

• Telling friends what’s going on with me.

• black seed oil 

• vitamins and minerals 

• being kind to myself and other

The most important thing I would tell someone who is about to jump is that your fear is greater than the pain and discomfort. Do it and fight through it. Time flys so fast on Kratom and life can just pass you by. This too shall pass is one of my slogans during this quit and also anytime I have a craving I think “not today satin!”

Im wishing you all success in your quit. Thanks to everyone who posts or just reads. The community is strong on here. Stay close to the heard and ill do the same.

I'm on day 5 and so far have experienced 

- diahrea
- sluggishness 
- extreme boredom (a big reason I take kratom is because I just have a hard time being still and sitting with myself) 

I workout daily so that probably helps with my mood some but dang I just enjoy that kick of excitement and stimulation you get from kratom. That's the hardest part for me.

I've been taking kratom for several years now and had breaks every now and again, but I've started to believe it does more harm than good for me. After the initial hour or so after the high wears off, I find myself getting more anxious than I used to be, and my whole day revolves around dosing.

My habit got as high as 60gpd and I made a promise to myself to finally come off it this month.

I tried to rapid taper 60-70gpd to 10g in the space of like 10 days. I felt really bad and couldn't sleep at all with restless legs and mass anxiety being far the worst symptons, yet still had to work my strenious  job. No magnesium supplement helped my restless legs/body. I didn't think i'd feel this bad and knew I couldn't quit like this, so quickly went back up my dose.

So after this experience I knew tapering slower  was the way forward.

I'm down to about 30gpd at the moment and had a few ups and downs with dosing, but have to be more resilient. The problem is I only have about 400-500g of powder left and wondered if I have enough to taper effectively.

With my current amount I worry I will have to reduce too quickly and feel really bad. This month is by far the busiest In my job of the year, and with the stress and all, I wonder if I'd be able to effectively taper with that amount or if its too rapid. Like I know I'm quitting but wonder if I can realistically do an effective taper plan with that amount I have. Any idea's or how rapidly I should drop, or if there's a better plan of action.

I am at a point where my life is going to shit. I am a 25 year old dude who has not accomplished much in life and find myself stuck in the same patterns that are trapping me from growth and living the life/becoming the person i want to be. 

I have been using Kratom on and off for about 2 years now. It started off not being a problem at all. I would dose 3-5 grams a day a few times a month, then took a long break of not using it. That break was probably because I started using other substances more frequently. I recently quit smoking weed and taking benzos (my 2 main substance problems) and having trouble coping with anxiety and depression I went back to kratom, using more than i have ever used. For the past 3 months I have been using almost every day. This last stint was usually 5-15 grams per day in 2 doses. But the last week or two i have ramped up to taking 6 grams before work and then a heavy dose of like 15+ grams at night when i got home. I am over doing this and I need to clear my head to work on my mental health in a more productive manner.

Part of the reason I started using kratom like I do now is due to bad nerve pain and a herniated disc. I sorta get used to the nerve pain and all but my disc has gotten to the point that without the stars aligning I usually cannot get more than 4-5 hours of sleep at once. I think a lot of it is my nicotine/weak core so I hope addressing thatll help BUT!  


I have no idea wtf I am supposed to do in the middle of the night. I remember in like 2015 after my brain injury but before kratom, particularly before I was vaping, if I woke up at night it'd be really unpleasant. AFAIK I would just bear thru it mindlessly watching Twitch but it was awful.

Before leaving my house, I was so close to taking a small amount of kratom mixed with my agmatine. My brain was convincing me to take it, but I said fuck that. I will feel super guilty. I need to be sober for this. Did I feel like absolute shit and anxious at times? Of course. But I was myself. My real me. And we had a great evening at her place.

This support of this group and the accountability has been a lifesaver for me.

3 weeks ago it began with some chest pain on my left side. 2 weeks ago I got a raspy voice that wouldn't go away. A couple of days ago I got a sore throat and headache. I kept telling myself it could be WD but wanted to be careful with covid, bronchitis, heart, etc.

I went to urgent care yesterday. I told the dr about tapering off Kratom (I've reduced almost half of my large daily use over 3 weeks). The dr. didnt know anything about kratom and I quickly tried to tell her a little about it. 

She said I had a ton of mucus production irritating my throat and voice. Mucus was clear so nothing bacterial. She diagnosed me with an upper respiratory infection. After listening to my heart and struggling in the past with silent reflux she gave me a super cocktail for heartburn. That got rid of my chest pain.

It's possible I had a respiratory infection but it's very possible my sore throat and voice issues were all from increased mucus produced by reduced kratom. Also my digestive system is going through a lot of reflux which kratom can wreak havoc on. 
I tested negative for covid and strep. I wasn't given any prescription medication for the respiratory issue.
At least I have peace of mind it's nothing serious.

I went to the doctor for a normal cancer screening via ultrasound last month. (I have a history of ovarian cancer in my family, so this was routine.) They found what they thought was a benign polyp. These are relatively common, so I wasn't that concerned. I was having really heavy periods, which the doctor said the polyp could cause, so she scheduled me for a routine surgery to remove it.

I had the surgery, and it went fine. However, when I woke up from it, the doctor informed me that, in fact, it wasn't a polyp, but endometrial hyperplasia — which is caused by little to no progesterone. Apparently, too little progesterone causes estrogen to predominate and the uterine lining to become too thick, leading to a buildup of blood along the uterine walls. If there's too little progesterone, periods can become painful and irregular. (My periods are very regular, but they are also heavy, so this depends on the person.) Low progesterone can also be caused by high prolactin, which controls breastmilk production. I'm not breastfeeding, but I do produce milk since I have been diagnosed with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia. (The hyperprolacinemia diagnosis was long before my kratom use, but it definitely got *worse* with the kratom. I've read opioid use can increase prolactin, so this makes sense.)

The doctors now want to put me on a progesterone pill — presumably for life. From what I know, my cancer risk increases and my fertility is affected, if I *don't* go on this. However, I'm reluctant to try it since I'm currently in the process of tapering and quitting Kratom. What if my hormones rebound?

Has anyone else had this issue, or any hormonal irregularities for that matter? I didn't disclose my Kratom usage, but I'm convinced that's what's caused the hyerplasia. I'm wondering, once I quit, will things return back to normal, rendering the progesterone pill unnecessary eventually? Is there any harm in taking it (i.e., will it prevent my body from producing its own)? Or, is it just like taking birth control, which you can stop whenever?

**tl;dr**: looking for personal anecdotes about hormone dysregulation caused by kratom, and I'm curious whether or not they rebounded for you. And if anyone knows, I'm also looking for answers to the other questions posed above, especially if they've had similar issues.

When I quit the alcohol last year I really wanted to quit kratom but needed to first attack my Xanax and ambien dependence. So I tapered off Xanax, then ambien and have remained off both. Kratom has felt like the biggest hurdle. I was at about 30gpd and I’ve had to take it every 3 hours for the last 4 years. I didn’t see how I could ever make the jump. However, early this year I did start tapering. I put in a lot of work and literally have no support but I’ve been committed. When I started drinking again it was due to being in a toxic relationship. My kratom use ticked up a bit too even though had been tapering but I didn’t go way back up. Well I left that asshole a little over a month ago and quit drinking again immediately. I got back on track with my taper but I still could not picture being able to actually jump. However I had a plan and method bc I’m very logical and knew that if I could get my dose very very low then in my brain I’d realize it’s mostly mental at this point and I’d just stop bc it wouldnt make sense to continue. I was still needing to dose every 3-4 hours. Once I got down to a single .5g capsule per dose I started to dump most of the capsules for each dose until I got down to about .1g each dose. Then I started trying to space out my doses as much as possible. Well, I finally, after 4 years of addiction and almost a year taper made the jump and I’m officially 24 hours off!

Mental clarity, etc. I was feeling a little depressed sure and a bit of anhedonia.
Out of nowhere last night while at the gym I suddenly said to myself “hmm I want to relapse on Kratom right now”. Left the gym, went to the headshop… and they didn’t accept Apple Pay. So I walked out and the clerk said “hey man just take it” and threw me the Kratom. I was like “ugh cmon”. 

I ended up taking the whole thing. Totaled out to like 55 g. I was at most a 25g a day user when I quit, 25 being on the high side. Long story short i had a terrible time, threw up a bunch, was useless today and couldn’t get any work on my final papers done. Did not take anymore K and definitely don’t plan on it. 

That experience was so gross the thought of doing K again makes me physically wretch. Wish I didn’t do it, but I’m not beating myself up. I’m just making SURE I don’t do anymore. The fact I didn’t do any today is a good sign. When I’m in the K hole I literally can’t stop. Today I felt absolutely no desire to do more. I like life sober. 

I guess I needed this little slip up? I find Kratom so much more disgusting after this instance than I did before.

I am extremely grateful to see that there’s such a huge following on here with people sharing their personal experiences and encouraging eachother. Very few things have I found online that are even semi-relatable. So first, thank you for taking the time to share your stories. My fear of the detox is genuinely the only reason why I haven’t quit up until this Thanksgiving. I have wanted it out of my life for the last year. 

Kratom started off as something almost miraculous and then quickly became straight poisen. It left me feeling frozen, depressed, reclusive, umotivated and lethargic, weirdly insecure, and lost. I ended up dropping out of grad school, staying far too long with an abusive partner (person who got me on it to begin with), became anorexic; weighing 93 pounds (OG weight 109), lost all creative focus, which was my natural remedy for depression.

So about five months ago I decided to do the hardest thing I’ve ever done and that’s returning back home with my family to get my life back together. Since that time I’ve been tapering my doses, “preparing” for the detox. When my boss offered off an extra few days for Thanksgiving break I realized that this was my chance to set myself free. I was terrified but also ready because my body just felt like it was falling apart. My muscles have even seemed to fade. I’ve always been naturally lean and toned, with minor exercise. My hair was thinning and my skin looked older then it should at my age. I know that this has something to do with it because after being off of it for seven days my skin already has so much more fullness and color. Enough to where my family noticed and commented on it.

Here’s my issue though, I am on day seven. My major symptoms like RLS, fever, tremors, intense aches have began to subside. They come in waves still, especially at night but are far less intense. My issue now is the need to constantly run to the restroom every other hour. Is it normal for diarrhea to start up 6-7 days after you begin detox? I’m asking because it seems as though that’s supposed to be an earlier symptom and It’s beginning to make me nervous. I have a splitting headache too from the dehydration. I’ve been drinking tons of Pedialyte, applesauce(BRAT diet), Pepto-Bismol, advil, and Metamucil. It’s helping a little but not enough to where I feel like I can function comfortably especially while I’m working.

Lastly, I’m just now starting to hit the stage of insomnia. Last night I had extremely dilated pupils and felt this almost manic amount of energy yet my body was so tired I couldn’t physically do anything with it. I just wanna know if any of these things are normal. Most research I have found claims that these symptoms should be close to gone by day 7. I’m not going to complain about finally getting a break from most of the earlier withdrawal symptoms, but these new ones feel almost equally as uncomfortable. I feel like my body is getting torn up.

Do you have any advice regarding this or think its a normal reaction? I understand you’re not a doctor. I also understand that most doctors do not know shit about K. Sorry for the essay, I’m honestly just desperate to connect with someone who can relate or provide some answers. I’m just ready for it to be over and be me again.

I also see a lot of people who have been *off* Kratom for awhile, so I thought I'd post again about experiences with this issue.

So, tinnitus — I'm experiencing it, and it's terrible. I cannot for the life of me tell whether it's a symptom of WD (I'm on a taper) or a symptom of dosing (after I take my reduced dosage). It seems worse after I take a dose, but it's (sometimes) still present even if it's been 12-16 hours or so. On certain mornings, I don't notice anything at all. But during the evening, it can be hell trying to fall asleep. It's only in one ear, and it's faint, almost like the sound of a fridge humming. For a few days I tried turning off all the appliances in my home thinking it was that, but it is definitely coming from my left ear.

For anyone experiencing this, and especially for those who have been off Kratom awhile — did your tinnitus go away? I've read on this sub that opiates can damage the inner part of the ear, creating permanent tinnitus. Is there anyone here for whom it *never* went away? Or, did it go away after a certain point?

I guess I'm looking for some comfort/ guidance here, because I'm going to go nuts if I have to deal with this for the rest of my life. I do know that my blood pressure spikes when I'm either in active, painful WD (usually 20-24 hours after my last dose) or *immediately* after I dose — my BP is not that high in between these times, hence why I'm trying to taper. And blood pressure spikes seem to be related to when I experience the tinnitus, so I'm really hoping that's what's causing it.

Right now, I have to wear headphones and keep white noise machines on all the time to deal with this. Is there any hope this goes away? What has your experience been?",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9991424083709717}"

I'm married (sometimes rather happily, sometimes not so much), have 2 kids, have a masters degree, and am in my dream job with so much potential to grow. Ive checked all the boxes. People from the outside think I've made it. They want to know how I did it. 

Outside of my pregnancies, I haven't been sober for longer than a week or two since I was 14-15. It's been alcohol, weed, adderall, ecstasy, opioids, cocaine and kratom. Currently it's weed and kratom. You'd think with all the bad habits I've quit, including smoking cigarettes, I would be so good at it now. But I have no idea how I quit before, I just did.

I feel so desperately alone in this world.

I decided to cut back before going cold turkey while I'm out for the holidays. I've been here a thousand times before. I feel like I have no self control. Because this morning I wasn't supposed to start until 8am. But when I woke up at 3:30, 4.5 hours seemed like an eternity. So I started. I basically wrote the amount and times for funsies, because I haven't followed it once. 

How is it possible to have enough self control and drive to make it through a competitive masters program, with 2 jobs and 2 kids but not a fucking day of cutting back?

I'm so mad at myself. 

It feels like no matter how many plans I make, I end up exactly where I started. Actually, usually worse. Every time I decide to quit I end up taking way more than normal for awhile.

I decided on September 10 of this year it was time to finally quit. I was taking 45 .6Gram caps a day at this point and it was doing nothing but costing me money and anxiety every time I ran low. I was taking 9 caps 5 times a day

I did my research and came up with a plan. I would taper by taking away 1 cap a day until I was down to a point that I could just stop. The first day I decided to take out 9 caps at one time. I thought it would make a big difference, but it didn’t. I continued to titrate by on cap a day over the course of the next 3 months. There were points that I just wanted to go back, but I knew that if I did, I would be right back where I was and couldn’t bare having to go through this again. You have to be flexible when you are doing this and don’t beat yourself up if you take the same number of caps each day for a couple of days until your body normalizes. I did experience mild withdrawal symptoms, but nothing compared to stopping CT. I think what made the big difference was to do this slowly and just keep going. I kept track each day of my progress, red this form and just kept going. When I got to 2.5 Grams per day I just stopped. I didn’t get RLS, cramps or chills, which was what I feared the most. I did get bad diarrhea for a week but got some Imodium and that helped a lot. It has now been 17 days and no Kratom.

I hate that I’ve got to make this post, but I need to come clean to you guys and myself. 

I quit kratom CT 5 months ago, after having been addicted to it for a year and a half, at about 25 GPD. I did really well for about two months, until one day I was getting ready for a job interview and thought, “A little kratom would really help me nail this interview.”

You all know what happened. I bought a small baggie, reveled in my low tolerance, then bought another and another and another. Within several weeks I was back to daily use and all my progress was reversed. Within a month, I no longer felt the buzz anymore. I was now, once again, taking kratom to feel normal.

It’s now been about 2.5 months, and my use has skyrocketed. I don’t even know how much I’ve been taking - I’m only just now today writing it down. I was using such a high amount because I’d taken this new job that I absolutely HATED, and the kratom helped me cope through it.

Eventually, last week, I finally quit that horrible job. Another job popped up immediately, at a hospital in a very cold and remote place that I’d worked in several years ago. Yesterday I committed to that job… and that’s when I realized that I need to quit the kratom. 

In about a week, I’ll be heading to a very far away place, where there are no headshops, and it takes weeks upon weeks to get mail there. I’ll have to bring a shitton of kratom up there, and eventually I will run out.  So I’ve decided to perform a long and gradual taper over many months. A slow descent down to zero. Cold Turkey at this point is impossible. I need to be able to work hard from the minute I arrive. 

I’ve never performed a gradual taper before, but I know that I can manage it. I just have to remain committed and very aware of the imminent threat of running out. As long as I stay busy with work, I should be able to stick to a dosing schedule that keeps me just above the threshold of pain.

This morning I started my day by writing down my first dose. I plan to continue throughout the day so I can plan a measured schedule. 

I also called my mom into my bedroom (I’m staying with her atm) and confessed that I am still using kratom. I had shared my past quitting journey with her… and she was not happy at all to hear that I didn’t remain sober. She’s understandably furious, but has agreed to help support me throughout this new tapering journey.

I will be posting here frequently, keeping myself honest and sharing my journey.  I hope to gain confidence by participating in this collective effort to be kratom free.

More than anything, I’m just so angry with myself for not having quit for good last time. Why… WHY did I buy that first baggy? I was in the clear! On the road to recovery. I can’t believe I let this happen again. I apologize to anyone that was following my journey before. I screwed up big time. From here on out I’m going to do my best to make you all proud.

My best friend is coming tomorrow from a few hours away which will be nice because I feel no pressure to be anything other than the way I’m feeling around her but this means that I have to wash my sheets since we sleep in the same bed and clean up the house a little since I’ve kind of neglected that for the past few days. I know that ultimately doing these chores will be good for me but the idea of carrying my sheets down to the basement to wash them feels so impossible right now. 


My appetite is starting to come back though! After two days of living on nothing but Gatorade and smoothies I’m finally feeling ready to have a muffin and some pineapple for breakfast. I bought all my favorite foods in preparation for this moment so that as soon as the urge strikes I can go ahead and enjoy a nice meal. 


I’m obviously having kratom cravings - they were especially bad last night - but my conviction to quit is stronger than my cravings. I’ve made a list of “tools” that I have to try using before I can buy a bag of kratom, including taking supplements/Tylenol and calling a friend, and it’s been working out really well for me so far. 


I know it’s going to get better really soon but my fear is that this won’t be the last day of my withdrawals and I’ll still have another day or two to deal with. And I’m telling myself that I can handle whatever kratom withdrawals throw at me but the truth is that I don’t know if I’d be able to put up with another two days of this. 



Idk what this post is, I guess I’m just trying to log my progress somewhere. Hope you’re all doing well in your quitting journey.",11,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9890484809875488}"

I destroyed my financial situation by going absolutely nuts on extracts for the last year.  I'm at 24 hours now and all I've had was 8g of capsules.  That is the least I've had in the last year.  I feel horrible.  Simultaneously I feel motivated and extremely....sensitive? For a change?  Silly me, I was growing extremely depressed and swore I just wanted to feel.  Kratom stops that when it's used the way I use it.  I use it to coast on autopilot. It's not fun.  I have about 12 gabapentin left.  Took some gaba at 530am.  Heading to work now.  I think if I can exhaust myself and potentially take GABA before bed or even a few capsules so I can sleep while my body cleans this stuff out.  Good luck to anyone else quitting.",26,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9995181560516357}"

Today is day 3. So far so good considering but I am having insomnia.
Does anyone know how long this will last? And whether there is any natural solution / medicine that helps?
Thanks!",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9918070435523987}"
