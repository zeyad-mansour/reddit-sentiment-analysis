We did an awesome job considering it was 2 women with 6 boys from 10 years old to 3 years old and one of us low on energy. I got news my court date was moved up to next Thursday and while it was heavy on my mind I was still able to be completely present for the entire meal prep and actually ate a ton!

2019-11-29 17:49:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/e3mhdo/struggling_with_taper/,Struggling With Taper,"Hey guys I'm home for the holidays from college and withdrawing a bit. I've been using everyday for the last 5 months. I couldn't bring my Kratom with me since I had to drive across the country and had to drive through a few illegal states. 

Once I got home though I picked up some Kratom and started my taper. I was taking about 12 gpd in two doses (one morning one evening down from a max habit of 20-30gpd split into 3 doses), with the new stuff I got I've been taking 9 gpd in two 4.5 gram doses. My schedule this far has been Sunday and Monday I had my full 12 gpd. Tuesday I had 12 grams again but split into 3 smaller doses, Wednesday I had 9g in two 4.5g doses, Thursday I also had 2 4.5g doses. This might have been too big a drop though because I was having some mild withdrawal symptoms when trying to sleep last night. The worst was the sweating and chills. Any advice on how to deal with those would be appreciated. I've managed to convince my parents I'm sick and they've been nice and helpful. I only got sleep last night because I found an old script of Clonidine I had and I found a study that said it helped opiate withdrawals and what do you know it did. I'm not too sure of the safety profile though so I don't want to take it too much. Today I took my 4.5 g dose at around noon and I've been riding it for the last 5 and a half hours. Trying to hold out dosing until 8 tonight. I took 1000mg of vitamin C earlier and some CBD oil and that helped a bit.

I've been hooked on Klonopin before so this isn't my first rodeo, I did a long taper on that though with the help of my parents as it was prescribed to me. My main issue is my chronic awful anxiety. Kratom has helped so much with that but I feel has also lowered my testosterone (less drive to work out and have sex), I'm also just sick of hiding a drug habit from people, having to take caffeine to stay awake in class, and being dependent on a substance to feel normal. The worst part is I don't have cravings to take more Kratom I just want the withdrawal symptoms to go away. This has been a recurring pattern with my drug use. 

I have a large amount of past trauma and have finally come clean about a lot of awful things that happened to me (got molested as a kid, got misdiagnosed with a fatal brain condition, got my face torn open by a dog) and sought help for those things, I'm hoping that will help me avoid turning back to physically addictive drugs once I manage to get off kratom. I haven't told my therapist I take Kratom though and I feel like it might be numbing me a bit too much for the therapy to be effective as it could be. That's another reason for me to quit. I also want to be the best I possibly can be for my girlfriend. We've been together for a long time she's the love of my life and I want to ask her to marry me, not before I get clean and deal with my issues though.

Today is Day 48 of quitting Green Malay CT. I was serving a **10-20 GPD** prison sentence for **6 months** (a relapse from a 1 year 1 month quit from a couple years of frequent use).

I am also dependent on Adderall (quitting that is a 2020 project). I am completely out of my Adderall a week before refill so I am trying to remain calm while realizing that I am going to have to cold turkey Adderall for this coming work week. But anyways the reason why I am mentioning this is because today I was scouring my room for an Adderall pill that I dropped last week (can't find it anywhere!) and I looked in my gym bag that I have been using almost every day since I quit Kratom and I freaking **found an almost full 5 gram bag of Green Malay**. Wow. It was very odd holding this bag of green powder that has held me hostage and brought so much anxiety and despair into my life.

In the past I would use Green Malay to get myself through Adderall breaks. **Not today**. I see this stuff differently since my recent quit and especially since reading posts from this community. Even the addict inside of me who loves spontaneous euphoria wasn't able to justify me using this crap. This stuff ruins you. It is awful for your body and your health.

I made a post yesterday regarding my second day of taking 50mg Naltrexone to deal with cravings. I miscalculated a bit, I'm actually on Day 7 CT starting today, but for the most part I assume the acute withdrawal stage is finished now (I don't feel anymore acute symptoms and I was able to stomach 50mg Naltrexone the last 2 days without going into precipitated withdrawal).

I suppose everything I'm reporting should be taken with a grain of salt since it's completely anecdotal and might even just be a placebo to some degree, but I thought I would make another report regardless to see if anyone has had similar experiences. 50mg Naltrexone seemed like way too much for me to handle after going through the acute stage. I will admit, it does seem to work great in that I basically had zero cravings on Days 5 and 6 (I usually have really bad cravings by this point) and basically felt like any and all impulsive/compulsive thoughts were muted. Obviously, knowing that kratom would have zero effect on me probably helped keep my mind off of it as well. However, it really felt like I've experienced zero natural joy or pleasure over the last couple of days as well, I just felt kind of down and depressed and had zero appetite, which I initially attributed to PAWS. I couldn't feel any enjoyment from things I usually enjoyed like talking to my parents on the phone, having my morning coffee, eating a nice meal, getting a hug from my girlfriend, etc. I just kind of felt like an emotionless zombie, albeit a zombie with zero desire to use kratom or seek out any other bad habit in my life. My sleep was also a lot worse last night compared to earlier days when I was in acute withdrawal. In summary, the Naltrexone does seem to be working for cravings, but I also seem to be experiencing a lot of the side effects from full dose treatment, and I don't know if I can wrap my head around feeling this way for 3 months (my doctor's recommended treatment length). It just doesn't make sense to me how feeling zero natural joy for 3 months is supposed to make it easier to stay sober.

I decided to make a solution with one of my Naltrexone pills and only took 4mg this morning. Again, I don't know if it's just placebo or not, but I do feel like I'm getting some positive results from a smaller dose without the negative side effects. I just kind of feel fine today, I'm back at work and I'm actually enjoying talking with my colleagues, feeling kind of positive and smiling for the first time in like 3 days. It's subtle, but it does feel a bit like I just had a good workout or something. I am experiencing some cravings today, but it does feel weakened compared to cravings I've had the last few times I've tried to quit. It's hard to explain, but I feel like I have more power to resist the level of craving that I'm feeling now. I think I will continue taking LDN for a week or two to see how it makes me feel and then maybe experiment with just stopping it altogether but keeping some on-hand in case I have a big craving flare up or something.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5551767}"

I'm sleeping more or less like a champ now. Exercising hard. Eating right. Intermittent fasting. Making positive life changes all over the place. I'm doing it.

Yet this past week, the other voice in my head, the one that justifies my use, has started getting REALLY persistent. He was there about 3 weeks in, when the heavy withdrawals faded. But he was easy to forcefully, consciously reject at that time because I could feel I was still craving the buzz on a physical level. I knew if I used again at that point, the physical addiction would overpower my resolve and it wouldn't be a one time relapse.

But now the need doesn't feel physical. It's just the sexy idea of relief from boredom, stress, anxiety. It's the voice telling me that just *one* Saturday afternoon with Kratom would be fun and then I wouldn't use again for months! I swear! Just once! Don't I deserve some fucking relief? 

And the other voice in my head - the responsible, dilligent one that got me through this - screams ""don't ruin this progress! You *know* you can't reliably take Kratom once and then not touch it again for months! Once you've had a taste, the bad voice convinces you to take it again a week later (cause once a week won't get you physically addicted right?). Then it's every 5 days (still fine, right???) Then you do a few days in a row just cause it's been a rough week (but you'll totally stop for a couple weeks after these few days, RIGHT???????) And like magic you're addicted again.""

I just don't understand why this can't be like drinking, which I do MAYBE once every two months at most. I can go six months without a drop of alcohol, then have a fun night with a bottle of wine among friends, a great little buzz, then wake up and not drink again for another six months. Why can't I have that with Kratom???? I mean, I - of course - know why. But I fucking hate it.

It's so bad, you guys, that the evil voice has been holding me back for days from writing this post, because it knew getting the thoughts out and reading your inevitable responses would really help me justify not doing something stupid this weekend. That voice didn't want me to have that support because it might be the difference between me making or not making a huge mistake...

I ended up finding a local clinic that offered Suboxone and Naltrexone, and I went in the next day.

The Naltrexone gave me a horrendous allergic reaction. Not precipitated withdrawals, but something like that feeling.

I then started Suboxone, and immediately broke out in a rash and my nose and eyes swelled shut. I thought it was just the type of Suboxone I had, so I tried films (I was given the generic pill at first) and felt better, though I struggled a lot with falling asleep for 6 hours in the middle of the day, and a lot of difficulty driving to the point I have walked in the 34 degree rain to buy groceries because I can't really focus my eyes.

Suboxone also increased chronic pain I have, which is usually pretty mild, and made my whole body ache. I couldn't get out of my bed and walk to the bathroom without feeling like my entire body was arthric and I was 90 years old.

I finally just lost my shit tonight. I'm packing up most of my apartment to put things into storage so I can travel more and possibly move out, and called my dad - which I NEVER do - and was hysterical. Flash forward to an hour later and we are texting and I said that the Suboxone is killing me. He said ""I know, we'll talk about it tomorrow."" (He's coming to my place for an early thanksgiving and to put stuff in his car to take to storage, which is kind considering I'm old enough to have my own storage unit but anyway....)

I found half a bottle of OPMS I thought I lost in my closet just an hour earlier. I took it, and within a half hour my pain significantly subsided and I calmed way down.

I feel screwed. I need to wean off Kratom, but my sub doctor also control the prescription of my klonopin and I'm terrified he's not going to continue it if I say I wan to stop Suboxone. I just can't physically handle it. And I feel awful for using Kratom but I don't know wtf else to do. Suboxone was destroying my life, and at least Kratom wasn't the entire reason I was so upset using it before. (Major lifestyle change/moved across state/super depressed).

If anyone can make me feel less shitty, or has any ideas, I'd appreciate it. If I wasn't going to see family tomorrow I'd check myself into the hospital. I still might tomorrow.

I've been lurking for awhile and figured I'd might as well make a post documenting my experience. I've been using kratom on and off (mostly on) for 2.5+ years now. I decided to quit because I'm getting really bad mood swings and what I like to call anxiety spikes. I believe the mood swings are caused by suppressed testosterone and I've had anxiety issues my entire life, but I believe kratom has made it worse over the long term. 

What is an anxiety spike? Imagine someone coming up behind you and poking you in the head with a needle. Your natural reaction would be to jerk your head and move your hands up to protect yourself, right? Well an anxiety spike is the mental version of this. Its a very sharp anxious thought that quickly pops up out of seemingly nowhere and hits you very quickly. Usually these thoughts are false positives, and shouldn't cause anxiety, but my brain likes to latch onto them and not let go. An example of an anxiety spike would be a quick thought saying ""Why the fuck did you send that text message?! Now the person is going to think your stupid/selfish/a jerk! Why did you fucking do that??!!"" accompanied with a head jerk and raising of the arms to protect the head. I'm describing this because I'd like to know if anyone else has had these before? They are extremely unpleasant and if anyone has any tips on how to decrease them then I'd greatly appreciate it. 

At the beginning of 2019 I was using 35 gpd. My new years resolution was to quit, I tapered all the way until july, but I wasn't quite able to make the leap. I made it to using kratom one day a week and held that up for over a month, but eventually relapsed and started using 6 gpd. My use mostly hovered around 6, but sometimes would creep up to 10 or 12 gpd. I decided that since I'm off work for thanksgiving and black friday that I might as well take the whole week off and just quit and get it over with. So I tapered down to 7 gpd and made the jump there. As of this writing I have not taken any kratom for 72 hours and I believe I am over the worst of the withdrawals. Honestly it wasn't as uncomfortable as I thought it would be. Which actually concerns me a bit.

You see, I have this theory that the more painful your withdrawal is then the less likely you are going to relapse. I've gone through amphetamine and phenibut withdrawal before and both were extremely painful, but I haven't fallen back into addiction with those substances ever since. The pain was so strong that it helped to re-enforce the choice of sobriety. I'm worried that this kratom withdrawal hasn't been painful enough and I'll lose my resolve and end up using regularly again. Guess I'll just try and do the best I can and see where that gets me.

I've been meaning to post my quitting update for a couple of weeks now but I've been so busy living life that I keep forgetting to check-in! BUT, so much has improved in my life since quitting kratom about 2.5 months ago (CT after a 20-25gpd habit over 3+ years). Quitting was hard, I relapsed 3 times when I found old stashes here and there but luckily had the wherewithal to not beat myself up over it and just keep going. 

Anyway, I want to share with you all a list of things I DO NOT miss about kratom (in no particular order):

1. **Green powder everywhere.** My clothes, bathroom counter, all throughout my bag... I deep cleaned my bathroom cabinets and found that shit EVERYWHERE. Yuck. Don't miss that!
2. **The taste!** Even when encapsulated or wrapped in an edible film wrap you just can't avoid the taste. Nasty! 
3. **My Temper.** Let's just say that kratom turned me into an angry old had. I was constantly snapping at my kids and husband, sometimes not even realizing how angry I was becoming. This actually got a bit worse the first two weeks or so after quitting, but is mostly gone now. I'm so much more patient and kind now!
4. **Constipation.** I know TMI, but it got to the point that I was taking fists-full of stool softeners and still struggling. It took a few weeks to a month to return to normal functioning, but I feel great now!
5. **Nausea.** I honestly didn't realize how much this was tied to the kratom. I just thought I was always nauseated in the mornings but nope. Not long after quitting I'm almost completely nausea-free!
6. **Edema.** Sometimes after a long day of heavy kratom dosing I would wake up the next morning feeling swollen and retaining water. My hands and feet would especially swell making my rings and shoes tight which was a bit disconcerting. 
7. **Bloating.** This is mostly from constipation, I believe but I would get SO bloated in my gut. More than once people asked me if I were pregnant which had never happened before as I'm relatively thin, just sometimes have this huge bloated belly... ick.
8. **My Hair!!** I lost probably half the thickness of my hair while on kratom.  It was also extremely dry all the time and damaged, lots of breakages. In the shower, it would literally come out in fists-full. I am FINALLY starting to see regrowth. I honestly think it takes a couple of months for the hair to start coming back but it will!! I promise!
9. **Money.** I'm stoked to have extra spending money that I'm not pissing away on green dirt. 
10. **Anxiety.** This is a complex one because after quitting my PAWS anxiety was rough for a few weeks. But, it had actually gotten pretty bad while I was taking the kratom anyway, so I'd need to quit sooner or later. (I chose sooner, and you can too! See below for more info on how I quit.) The anxiety is almost completely gone now, I'm honestly feeling great!
11. **Depression.** I've struggled with major depressive disorder most of my adult life and was actually self-medicating when I started taking kratom. It worked wonders! Better than any other anti-depressant I had ever taken... until it didn't. After a couple of years of daily use, it just stopped working in the way it once did. I lost my confidence, uplifted mood wouldn't come, the kratom just made me feel sick without any noticeable benefit after a while. At this point I knew I had to quit, but, as an educator, I knew the timing was terrible (I had just started the semester so it would be difficult to take time off). I contemplated waiting until the end of the semester to quit but didn't want to feel like shit for that long. The PAWS depression was, as expected, tough to get through, but I saw my psychiatrist soon after I quit to try a new depression treatment which I think has been helping to keep my head clear so I don't relapse/self-medicate.
12. **Questionable Health Issues.** Before I quit I was getting these waves of what felt like hypoglycemia or vertigo. I have no idea whether this is related, but it hasn't happened since I quit. I also had some abnormal blood lab work (high creatinine levels, apparently) which have gone down moderately since quitting. 
13. **Being an Addict.** This one was hard for me. I kept my kratom use from absolutely everyone, not even my husband or friends knew I used. So I had to quit completely on my own too. Anyway, that said, one of the greatest feelings I have, almost like a rush of pride and confidence I get whenever I think about how far I've made it, and that I'm quite certain I will never touch that shit again.
14. **Making Bad Decisions.** I won't go into this one too much, but my dependence on kratom lead me to make some really bad choices to obtain, use and hide the drug. I feels good to have this deception behind me and know I won't do it again.

I decided to quit in September because kratom just stopped working for me, but was making me feel terrible. I knew I needed to quit but didn't know how I would be able to do so while working full-time. I ultimately decided to just go for it, took Friday and Monday off work and took my last dose on a Thursday morning. The acute phase wasn't as bad as I expected, to be honest. I used Black Seed Oil which was the only supplement that I know for certain really feel made a difference. That and epson salt baths or magnesium supplements. I also too buspar which is an anti-anxiety, and this seemed to help with both the acute and PAWS. I'm not taking any of these meds/supplements anymore. Mostly just took them for the first 1-3 weeks. I also found that it helped to temporarily replace my addiction with something more benign. I know that's sort of controversial, but I just bought a bulk package of blow pops which was a nice treat--dopamine hit-- that also gave me something to keep me distracted for a while. 

I don't miss kratom anymore at all. I did for the first several weeks (like 4-6 weeks, to be honest), mostly I would just be extremely bored. This feeling passed. Quitting kratom was one of the best things I've ever done for myself. I feels good to really feel things and to know that I working my way back to mental and emotional clarity. I hope this note will give someone the strength to take the plunge. If I can do it, truly anyone can. Good luck everyone!!",34,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.3865499}"

I don't even know what I'm doing lol just trying to survive I guess. I know I need to just toss it, but giving up the ""ritual"" of mixing it up and sipping on it once in the morning and once in the afternoon has been REALLY hard, like I freak out when I hit dosing time and I don't know what to do with myself.

Withdrawals have never completely left even after taking those small doses. High dose Vitamin C is an absolute life saver, along with clonidine.

Still addicted to Kratom, though, because the other issues are making it unsafe to quit. I came here and complained of kidney pain/swelling, UTI and kidney infection, possible kidney failure, chest pains, and I thought kratom had caused it all. Doctors think kratom did cause all of the issues, but aren't sure exactly how. What happened was as follows.   


I took kratom for a year or two, never had any issues. Eventually noticed frequent urination, and after that persisted for about a month, started having kidney problems. This happened because kratom caused Acute liver injury, and that had the side effect of causing kidney function problems. Lowering my dosage made these symptoms go away mostly, thankfully, because the next issue is why I can't quit. Chest pain came with these other symptoms, and I went to the hospital on five or six separate occasions over the past few weeks for it. At the same time every night, it feels like i'm having a heart attack. Tests for my heart health all come back saying i'm in good health, and because the symptoms are intermittent and only at night, tests for things like arrhythmia and palpitations or anything abnormal came back good too. Doctors I saw decided to ignore my complaints and focus on my kratom addiction, saying that the liver/kidney problems will clear up with quitting, and outright ignoring my heart pain complaints due to the tests being fine. They wrote it off as me not understanding the withdrawal (despite me explaining that i've been through opiate withdrawal before, know the symptoms well, and that the heart pain occurred regardless of if I was in withdrawal or not.. fucking infuriating). It took until tonight, and me persistently going back every time the pain came up, to figure out what it was. A rare disorder called ""Coronary Slow Flow"". It is, for whatever reason, when an artery decides to tense up and limit blood flow to the heart, creating the symptoms of a heart attack without causing the warning signs that are tested for during a heart attack. This can cause sudden death, although luckily at a lower rate than actual heart attacks. The blood pressure rise from kratom withdrawal may exacerbate this, so I may literally not be able to quit while this is going on. It really sucks. I'm 25, very physically fit, eat a super healthy diet, and have never had any serious health problems. In a little over a year on kratom it's nearly killed me now in two separate ways (the acute liver injury and this heart issue). This plant is fucking terrible.   


Last time I posted here, I said I gave up on quitting temporarily because of the other things going on with my body, and the severity of the withdrawal. I was prescribed clonidine to help the withdrawal, and i'm pleasantly surprised that it really does. The symptoms were super mild in comparison to going at it without clonidine. But clonidine being a blood pressure lowering medication, my heart issues, and kratom withdrawal raising blood pressure, my doctor thinks it's best that I just stay on Kratom until we can figure out something to do about this. I've been taking 5 grams a day, split between 4 doses (which is down from around 30-40 grams a day before the problems showed up) and the liver/kidney problems have been somewhat resolving themselves as I take less. The heart issue seems here to stay though. I'm going to the hospital in an hour or two (just waiting on my phone to charge) to be treated with calcium channel blockers. I'm actively considering switching to oxycodone because while the withdrawal is worse, I at least know that it's not going to cause me to abruptly die, either through further liver damage or heart issues. This has been a fucked up past few weeks and I'd really like to go back to work at this point. Let this be encouragement for anyone on this board in the process of quitting. Fucking do it, right now. Don't end up like me. I don't have insurance and this has caused me nearly $10,000 in medical bills while doctors have tried to figure out what the hell is wrong with me. Best of luck to everyone here with quitting or staying clean, and thanks for the support in my first thread.

All the supplements and meds, most useful have been clonodine and vitamin C mega dosing. 

I woke up after a full 7.5 hrs of uninterrupted sleep this morning!  (Thanks clonodine and, already-dependent klonopin).  Went for a run, and I have felt damn near normal today.  My appetite is back in a big way.  Eating heathy and exercise is probably a big help.

Interesting things to note: when I got to a certain point in the taper, I started waking up in the middle of the night multiple times, and stayed in a perpetual state of w/d every couple hours after dosing for the last couple of weeks of the taper (10gpd to 8, then from 8 to 0 over 7 days).  Also, rapid heart beats and panicky feeling throughout the day started around that time. Still elevated but not nearly as high as it was before.  

I feel much better today than I have the last two weeks of the taper.  Definitely should have just jumped a week ago.  Aside from several sneezing spells and nasal congestion, no other symptoms today.  I did continue with 2.5g buffered C powder 4x today (waking, lunch, dinner, bed).  Tapering looks like it worked, just the tail end was not worth the squeeze.  For me anyway, 8-10 gpd is objectively more miserable than zero after the first two days.

Long story short I used kratom to quit a 10 year suboxone addiction (which was used to quit an opiate addiction) and I‚Äôve been clean off suboxone and using kratom for about 2 1/2 months. I was taking around 3 gram doses 4 or 5 times a day. When I started I told myself I would only take it on days I had to go to work and never take it when I‚Äôm off. It got to the point that every time I was off and tried not taking it I would be in withdrawal. Diarrhea all day, horrible RLS at night, sneezing, etc. I decided I was tired of spending my days off this way so decided to try to quit cold turkey. My last dose was late Thursday afternoon and I‚Äôm starting to see a little improvement today but still zero energy. I go back to work tomorrow after 3 days off of work and it will be day 4 without any. I find it hard to make it through the work day stone cold sober since I have a job that requires me to walk 12 miles a day and it comes with a lot of pain.

I‚Äôm motivated by the fact that I want to get pregnant within the next year or two, and that I‚Äôve lost about 1/2 the volume of my hair due to side effects of kratom. 

Over the last year I have gathered numerous supplements and medications to help me. These include: clonidine, seroquel (for sleep), gabapentin, two 1mg Xanax (for the first 2 days), Black seed oil, agmatine, rhodiola, ashwaganda, l-tyrosine, vitamin C powder, magnesium, and plenty of cannabis. I also found one tramadol pill that I was considering using on day one of my cold turkey but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs a good or bad idea, as it may just prolong the WD symptoms.

I've posted on here a few times before, but never while actively quitting kratom. I have had a strange 6-month relationship with kratom - on one hand, it has had undeniable positive effects on my life. I'm a college student with rather severe anxiety and a history of substance abuse. 

On one hand, kratom has undoubtedly helped me step outside of my social anxiety, and has helped me to claw my way out of alcohol dependency and a rather extreme vaping habit. 

On the other hand, my kratom consumption has repeatedly gotten way out of hand, followed by periods of hellish tapering/withdrawals. Rinse and repeat. It has never really harmed my social or personal life, but as a fairly broke kid, damn has it killed my wallet. 

The final straw: on Wednesday night, out of the blue, I had my first ever seizure. Around midnight, I was having trouble sleeping and went downstairs to get my cat. On my way to my room, I tripped. The last thing I remember was falling with a loud crash, and then waking up to paramedics above me.

This whole experience has been bizarre to me, and I have no clue if the seizure was actually caused by kratom or just head trauma, or the adderall I had taken that morning. Regardless, it's time to quit. I'm 4 days in right now, and let me tell you, it fucking SUCKS. However, even at my bizarre dosage (probably closer to 120 GPD lately) , it isn't  *that* bad. The restless legs are honestly the worst part. I've been prescribed gabapentin for the last day, and it's truly a night and day difference.

Anyway, I just want to tell you what you all already know - the FEAR of quitting is worse than the PAIN of quitting. I was planning on quitting over Christmas break to avoid letting withdrawals affect work or school, but, well, here I am. If any of you have been waiting for the inspiration to take the leap, come with me. I can't guarantee I'll be on reddit much, but I hope it might help someone to know that others are going through the same thing they are.

I quit with suboxone, because I've had previous addictions to pills and adderall, so I need something to keep me sober. I wasn't very good about taking the subs consistently, so every few days I would get frustrated and ""decide"" to use Kratom again and taper off of it. But the Kratom doesn't feel good at all with the Suboxone, so back and forth I went.

I then tried to quit subs, and the withdrawals after 72 hours brought on total body pain and rage, especially using Kratom and then the microwithdrawals between doses.

So, I'm quitting. I'm done. No more. I cannot keep using it, its a f\*cking horrible thing and I HATE revolving my life around it. Ashamed I had to ask for financial help from my parents again because I spent too much on extracts last week. I cannot keep doing that.

At this point like feels fresh and amazing again. I wake up feeling great every day, I go to bed feeling great every night. I think cutting the alcohol out I have a massive impact on that part of life. Getting rid of the K made it everything feels so much more fresh and exciting like being a kid again. Of course at first it was not that way but as I progress it gets better and better.

Feeling good again and doing it quickly, exercise. I know everyone says that but I‚Äôm so serious. Work out. Work out every single day if you can.

I accomplished a few things yesterday. Nothing crazy outstanding but better than sitting under the covers all day. Taking a shower is a victory. Eating is a victory. Putting the trash out is a victory. That is what it has come to, the end result of my back and forth kratom vicodin cycle.

I'm going to stay in the day. I'm going to try to grocery shop-the worst thing ever in my opinion. Have always hated it. And of course its fucking pouring out. 

But as the saying goes, the worst day clean is still better than the best day high.

I have a very troubled 15 year old daughter. Has stolen thousands from me in my stupor. And i never had the guts or the clarity to stop her. In this last week, jesus, my eyes were open. I could see her cunning actions straight away. Caught her in multiple lies. Could actually face her one on one. Of course I had that crazy strong anger that comes from cold turkey on my side. Funny how much slips by you when you're in the kratom daze. Shes gone wild on me, screaming at the top of her lungs, calling me a dumb ass bitch. And I did nothing. Not this week. She lunged at me and I grabbed her arm and did not let go. I couldn't believe my own strength. No more bullshit. No more. And no more of my own. I. Have. Sucked. Time for change.

Need help getting completely clean.,"Hey, I could use some advice. I‚Äôve been using opioids for years. Started off with oxy then opana. I detoxed cold turkey from opana and oxy twice and made it about 21 days before I started using again. I started back for awhile and then went to maintenance with methadone for about a 8 months. Last year, I detoxed cold turkey from methadone with the help of kratom. It helped enormously. However, I was then physically dependent on the kratom. Taking about 5 grams every four hours because I would start to feel strange. You know the anxiety, crawling skin, slight churning of the stomach. I was on kratom for about 5 months before I started using oxy again. This time only for about three weeks before I switched to sub for maintenance for the next 8 months. About three months ago, I quit the subs and switched to kratom again. This time I have to take it about every two hours before I start feeling sick. Idk if it is because my body remembers the kratom dependency from last time or what? It sucks. I have zero energy all the time. I get woken up out of my sleep early in the morning and I have to drink kratom to fall back asleep. This is no way to leave. I can‚Äôt go out for the night on a date to dinner and a movie without having to bring kratom with me. I‚Äôve tapered down about .5 grams on each dose every week or so for the past month. I am at 2 grams every two hours until I go to sleep as of now. How much more do I need to taper down before hopping off? I was told I could hop off and make eat a 10mg oxy a day to ease the kratom withdraws for a few days then tough it out the rest of the way. Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm not worried about this being a way to fall back into oxy addiction. I have no desire to get high. My life has changed enormously. I have aspirations and I am a full time student almost finished with my degree and plans to go to law school. That‚Äôs another reason I need to get off kratom. Shit is so stressful doing it with full-time school. Is this a good way to get off kratom? Or are there better days? This semester is over in two weeks and I have a three week break from school. This will give me enough time to detox fully and be well by the time school starts again, I hope. Please any advice you have for me is much appreciated.

Technically I won't be there for a few hours but I wanted to post about it now as I'm going to be at work later.  Things have been going pretty well.  I've actually felt really good most of this last week.  Work has been fine and I'm starting to give serious consideration to quitting pot now so I'll have more/better job opportunities.  It's legal where I live but jobs can still test for it.  I probably still won't be totally ready to quit for a little while but the desire to is starting to bubble up which is step 1.  I've been keeping up with my cardio and feel really good about it.  My resting heartrate is way down (high 40s to mid 50s, it's been in the low/mid 70s most of my life) and it is a great feeling.  I have more I want to do with excercise in the future.

My depression has kind of been clearing up for the first time in ages.  The last time I really remember feeling like this was a few months was when I was 19.  At the time i wasn't yet physically dependent on opioids but I had a history with stimulants and some alcohol abuse as well.  I had dropped out of college and spent a year doing nothing but feeling bad for myself.  At one point I took 3 hits of acid with a friend and had this revelation that as long as I'm trying to make things better I deserve to feel happy.  I spent the next few months in a very motivated and very happy state before I fucked it all up.  Anyway I kind of feel the same way now even though I haven't tripped in a long time.  I think I can avoid fucking it up too badly this time.

I‚Äôm checking in with an update on my taper.  For those who haven‚Äôt read my posts before, I was on subs for years (16mg to start). Tapered that to 2 mg fast, then it was very very slow.  Eventually I got to 1mg, jumped to 30gpd of Kratom.  65ish days on Kratom.  Tapered down to 10gpd and then it got painful.  Went from 8gpd to 0 in one week.  I feel better today than yesterday, and much better today than I did the last two days taking any Kratom.  

I am not 100%, but the feeling I have is much less severe than flu.  I attribute this to the following: clonodine, vitamin C (‚Äúmega‚Äù doses, 4-5x per day of a scoop of buffered C powder, starting several days before I jumped), and exercise.  I also have klonopin, which helps, but I was basically dependent on it by the time I jumped since I had been on it for months and taking low dose nightly to help with the sub tapering. Benzos are bad, but they were not a new variable in my Kratom equation.  If you get some for your tapering/jumping, don‚Äôt use them nightly..  also I take B vitamin complex, L-tryptophan, vitamin D, magnesium.

The biggest difference I noticed was when I started being very consistent with the vitamin C.  For the past three days, day 1 (first full day) was the worst.  I was in withdrawal before I went to bed the evening prior.  Still went to work and no one could tell that I was in WD and I got my work done. Taking the C powder made the difference between calling in sick and going in and doing fine. 

Today I woke up feeling markedly better than I have in a week.  No pounding heart rate, no immediate anxiety.  I did a lot of sneezing and sniffling, but the only times I had physical pain were a few hours after my last C dose.  Lack of motivation is here but not a big deal since it‚Äôs the weekend.  Read  online medical studies about the efficacy in resolving opiate withdrawals when mass doses.  A doctor prescribed it to me for sub withdrawal 4/5x per day in 2.5g scoops. You have to ‚Äúpre load‚Äù your body for a couple days before you need to rely on it for withdrawal dissipation .  Now, I take it, the joint pain/restlessness dissipates.  I laughed today, ate plenty of good food, and didn‚Äôt feel any worse than I do when I have a cold.

Clonodine is also a key element here.  It‚Äôs definitely what‚Äôs helping me sleep and keeping away the pounding heart.  I didn‚Äôt take any earlier, and about 5-6 pm, I noticed my heart rate increase (nowhere near as high as it went during that last week on Kratom but still higher than my normal baseline. ) Took it, it has kicked in (with my klonopin) and I expect to get another 7-8 hours of sleep as I have the last couple nights.  

Takeaways for those similarly situated? If you have tapered to below 10gpd, get supplements routine going( especially buffered C powder, can‚Äôt recommend enough) and if you are having that heart rate issue, get some clonodine and just jump.  Also you just have to exercise, period.  Do at least 20 minutes and sweart.  Get that heart workings done sweat.  Wearing yourself out both replenishes neurotransmitters but also helps every aspect of withdrawal.

If you do these things, In less than 48 hours you will feel better without Kratom than with it. That‚Äôs been my experience anyway.  Looking forward to how I will feel when I wake up tomorrow.  Keep going!  Now that I see how manageable this part is, I really wish I had just done it last week and I‚Äôd probably be 95% back to ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù",12,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.4806508}"

I'm now on Day 2 of CT and recently saw a doctor who was willing to prescribe me Ativan (for acutes) and Naltrexone (for cravings) to aid in my recovery. The doctor was really nice and empathetic, probably the best I've seen before actually, and didn't want me agreeing to anything I was uncomfortable with. She pretty much gauged exactly what I wanted (ie, no long-term medications but a bridge treatment using medication to get me from a point of addiction to a point of sobriety and a point of naturally less compulsions/cravings to use). She said I could start with taking 25mg right away or maybe a day after my last kratom dose, but after reading about the hells of precipitated withdrawal, I'm a bit nervous to do so (doctor's logic was ""you're going to be sick when you stop regardless). The pharmacist told me that I should wait 7 days since my last kratom dose before taking it, but kind of conceded that I could start with 25mg after about 48 since my last kratom dose and then eventually work my way up to 50mg daily.


As of right now I'm using the Ativan and some Lyrica that i have to get through the acute stage, and my plan is to start with 12.5 or 25mg of Naltrexone on my fifth day of sobriety. My logic being that this is about when the acutes start to subside naturally and it's somewhere between the pharmacist's worst-case scenario 7 day wait period and my doctor's suggestion to just wait a day or so before taking it.


Am i likely to experience precipitated withdrawal after 5 days of CT detox following a 2-3 week relapse/binge? Does anybody have any experience using naltrexone to aid in their recovery? I'm not a super heavy drinker but I am curious as to how 3 months on Naltrexone will impact my drinking or other addictive tendencies and cravings in my life (obsessive checking of news/apps, pornography use, etc.). I'm also kind of worried about the idea that Naltrexone will remove the reward effect of healthy things I like such as exercising or a healthy sex life.


Anyways, any input would be greatly appreciated, I'm determined to get in control of my addictions and addictive personality traits.

Thankfully, it hasn't gotten too out of control because of hellish past experiences with withdrawal. This is becoming so tiring. I am like a broken record coming back here with the same repetitive story. I can make it a month and then I keep thinking I can get away with it. I've been using the past two days at doses around 10gpd. Had a break of a few days before that with no major withdrawal but I know where it goes from here and know I need to stop again. Personal issues have made it easy for me to pick it up again. I have plenty of tools to help me through this not that I think I will really need them but they are there if I'm having a bad day. I'd say I've been dosing about 4 days a week the past 3 weeks. Started going out with a really lovely and beautiful girl and used kratom on our first date, telling myself it was a one off. Well as it turns out I've fallen head over heels in love with her so I need to straighten out this problem sharpish cos I want to make a go of it with her. It's just blindsided me yet again and I'm using more and more. I used some GHB for a week to deal with withdrawal and it worked really well for me. But you think kratom is bad? GHB is one of the most addictive and compulsive drugs out there and it will take over your life without you even being aware of it. Self control goes out the window with this stuff and the you are fucked cos the withdrawal is one of the worst. Haven't experienced it myself yet but I've read enough about it. I will probably utilise it again a day here and a day there. Famous last words. Don't ever go near this stuff, trust me. It's a fucking dangerous game to play too cos if you screw your dose up by 0.1ml it could be the difference between a good time and checking out of the hotel permanently. Anyway, ready to tackle this shit again and I have a healthy rage built up inside me that I will use to assist me. Thanks guys.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6102647}"

I'm just posting to see what this group ( let alone Reddit) is all about. A little history. I'm a recovering addict (opiates) who thought Kratom would be an end all be all of recovery tools. Which I knew deep down was one in the same. Anyways, my longest amount of clean time from dope was 6 months. I stopped going to NA because I feel like I can't go while I'm using Kratom. I appreciate what it does for people as far as getting clean or stopping the hard drugs, but for me I have to stop. I recently moved to PA with a trusted friend, who has never used. He is letting me stay with him. I'm secluded away from civilization for the most part, so I have no access to anything except for Kratom. I moved up here to quit. I need tips from anyone. Im going to try to taper down. Maybe someone in the thread could just comment so I could talk to them for support on this thread when I need it. I'm a musician, so I have that to keep my mind busy, but nothing really seems to stop me when I KNOW I should be lowering my dose. I think I may just have to admit to the fact that I am very weak mentally. My old sponsor said he thinks something may be wrong with my head, besides just being an addict. I'm not trying to sound like I am any worse than anyone else, or like I'm crazy lol. I am actually a very calm and collected individual mostly. I just have a severe problem with losing willpower when it comes to quitting. I always begin to feel about one hour after a dose that I am depressed. Even when I had first started taking kratom. Then I feel the only way to be happy again is to take more, and that doesn't really help either. So there's no point for me to be taking more. But I need to gain some form of willpower. I don't know. Anyways, I researched phenibut and I'm not worried about getting addicted to it because I only have enough money to order it once and also have no job until two weeks from now. But some say it also just simply doesn't work for Kratom withdrawals at all. Is there anything that does help? I know there's really no way to kill withdrawals completely. But I've been clean for a few months timeframe a couple of times. Like 3 attempts. Attempt one I was clean for 2 months, attempt 2 i was clean for 4, and the final attempt was 6 months. My second attempt was the only time I went through the WDs cold turkey and it was HELL. I feel like such a wimp, ive heard of so many people quitting Methadone, H, and other stuff cold turkey and toughing it out. But as a man I'm ashamed to admit I'm terrified. Im sorry for oversharing, but I've never talked to anyone about this extensively. Anyways, is there anything that truly helps? Not like Melatonin for sleep, or this or that that may or may not help. But something that actually takes the edge off a great deal? I'm not working with a lot of money but is there anything that will help with the first few days of WDs? If not, it is what it is. If anything, maybe someone could just comment every once in awhile and give me something to reply to to keep my head busy. I've always said, I'm a musician, and I feel like I'm trying to live ""the rockstar life"" without being a rockstar lol. I have to stop.

Also my hairline was way thicker before starting Kratom based on a picture from 1 month before the beginning of my use.

Long story short for those who don't know my tag, started taking K about a year and 2 months ago. A friend at work introduced me to it, and like many others, boy I wish I hadn't have taken that first dose. Though hindsights 20/20, she was an ex-fent addict, so that should've been a warning sign. But enough about that.


I quit the first time 11/11/18. Always took caps, and at that point, never took more than 10gpd. I quit for nearly 100 days. Nearly. 100. Days. Late February came around, and I got back on the wagon. Rode it until mid-april, quit again, done for 3 weeks, got back on. You get the idea.


After another 7 month stint on it, and getting up to nearly 60gpd, I decided, since my psych was going to prescribe it (I have legitimate pain problems, herniated L5/6 and fused C5/6) I went on Suboxone. This was a little over a month ago. I don't have insurance, so the films were costing me $220 a script. So the other day he switched me to Subutex (Suboxone w/o the naloxone) purely from a cost standpoint. I was on 8/2 films, and went to 8mg tablets. At first it managed my pain great, but yesterday, it felt like I was in full-blown WD, even though I was actually taking it.


Now I'm taking all of this, as prescribed. Not taking more than I'm supposed to. And from the r/Suboxone subreddit, I should just be able to do a quick taper and be fine, and I'm sure that's the case, but my thought process is the horror of sub withdrawals, is only gonna build the longer I'm on it, so I'm debating switching back to low dose K (4-8gpd) and tapering that, because I'd rather go through the K wds.


I've got every reason to fight now. I have found the love of my life, and her daughter is absolutely adorable. I was on the phone with her for a long time last night crying because of the bed of nails I've made for myself. And she just comforted me, and told me we were gonna be okay, and we were gonna get through this, and that she loved me. That right there set the stage for me wanting to put the sub and K out of my life for good. That and me wanting to be the best me that I can be for my future wife and step-daughter, and child.


So my main point is, do I continue and taper the subutex? Or do I switch back to low dose K and taper that?

If you create unhealthy habits around your use (deorganized sleeping habits, eating habits, deficiency of minerals and vitamins, binge drinking) after you quit cold turkey you would suffer from this things either. So before even if you are still using start to work on these. I try to taper down before but my willpower always fail me. This time i was tapering down in different way instead of lowing the amount I miss doses.

I take morning doses for getting out of the bed but then not take none in the afternoom which bring me slight discomfort and after that take the evening one to be able to sleep. When I was doing it I could easily lower my dosage too. It doesnt even take long before I was able to quit cold turkey and now I am on the day four and too this day I just felt little discomfort in the first day but that was all.

Another thing which is important is too find something to do and dont lurk around this subreddit.

No matter the severity of the withdrawal, I always feel absolutely hopeless.

My symptoms came on quickly, which I'm thankful for because today I'm starting to feel myself come around the bend so to speak. But I feel confused and dysphoric, how did this happen? I'm no stranger to drugs and addiction but I truly had no idea what I was getting into with kratom.

* Had my hair thin dramatically, especially in the front
* Developed ED and been incapable of being intimate with my partner.
* Become incontinent- urine seems to drip out of me no matter what and I have to change my boxers multiple times a day.
* I have to go to the bathroom 20+ times a day, and my urine smells extremely strong.
* I vomit almost every single day, sometimes multiple times a day.
* My brain is constantly in a haze, and my ability to think critically is basically non-existent.
* Kratom used to help me socialize, but now my head is so foggy that when I try to talk to people I'm unable to keep up any kind of conversation.
* I've basically stopped talking to everyone in my life, my phone is full of unopened texts because I feel no drive to reach out to anyone.

Time to quit again.,"How did i get here again. Well, i had 10 months clean and i was still depressed and doing nothing about it thinking that it was just paws. I kept having these thoughts that i was only really addicted for 6 months and i was able to do it occasionally before then. So now that i beat the addiction i can do it occasionally right? Very wrong. The catalyst that got me back was a starting a new job and wanted to be social and not awkward. It quickly turned right back into where i was before. Last time i quit i had weed to get me through it. Thats out of my life too. Its sucks. I know work is going to be horrible once i quit. But its already horrible between my doses, im super bipolar and just focus on little annoyances like their a big deal. Im going to be tough to be around but i already am besides the few hours of the day im on kratom. But i know once i can get a few weeks away ill be a human again. At least i keep my dosage in check and have stayed at less than 10gpd usually like 6 or 7. Writing this to stay busy and prolong my next dose. I am on antidepressants now and im going to start seeing a therapist.

I wasn't really measuring, but I estimate my use 3 weeks ago when u got fired, I'd guess it was about 28 to maybe 40gpd some days. I'm at 5gpd right now and mainly just emotional (but I've also got legit life stressors).

I'm jumping soon, probably this weekend (just started a new job and didn't want to show up shaky and pale). Somehow I feel the high from just 1g and I hate it. The feeling reminds me of who it made me become and it's completely unenjoyable!",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8296856}"

This is my third attempt at quitting and quite frankly. I think it‚Äôs the final one. The thought of Kratom both disgusts and excites me. The cravings are pretty intense, but I stop myself every time. I keep reminding myself the 2-3 hours of euphoria aren‚Äôt worth the comedown and constant dosing. 

The physical symptoms aren‚Äôt that bad. Mainly sneezing and some lethargy. I take vitamin C, Valerian Root at night and some GABA. I‚Äôve stopped drinking Mountain Dew entirely and I feel great. I used to drink 5-6 bottles a day. FIVE OR SIX BOTTLES. Like who does that? I did. 

Now I drink strict water or Water Joe if I want caffeine. It feels like a cleaner caffeine buzz. Doesn‚Äôt make me feel like garbage. 

I can feel my old self slowly coming back. My rambly self and I love it. 

I have two female friends at work who are my support system. I work in hospital so it‚Äôs easy to stay busy. They are really helping me and I love them both. Shoutout Katie and Marissa. You know who you are!

My emotions are coming back. It‚Äôs nice not being completely numb all the time. 

Friday night, about 12 hours after my last dose, I randomly started crying. No idea why. Maybe it was fear because I knew the withdrawals would be coming. 

I‚Äôve had some slight RLS, but nothing that kept me up too long. Honestly that‚Äôs what I was most worried about but it seems pretty tame so far. 

I‚Äôm happiest about my emotions coming back and genuinely laughing and smiling. It feels great. I‚Äôm also happiest about being able to eat food and not killing my Kratom buzz. That‚Äôs sooooo worth it. 

I‚Äôm happy. I‚Äôm smiling. I‚Äôm full. I‚Äôm working out. I have great friends.

The problem is high levels of prolactin. This is the hormone that causes females to produce milk when they have babies and in men it is produced immediately after orgasm and is responsible for the massive drop in desire immediately after sex.  I guarantee if you have prolactin checked on Kratom you‚Äôll see elevated levels regardless of your testosterone numbers. You‚Äôre constantly in the same post-ejaculatory state.  There are a couple of drugs available to lower prolactin but they are prescription only and come with a profile of side effects and risks that I don‚Äôt think are worth it. 

Libido will return after you quit Kratom but it can take some time.  For reasons unknown to me at this point, that time can vary.  Perhaps other determinants are also impacting prolactin that I haven‚Äôt isolated.   I‚Äôve quit a half dozen times (I‚Äôve always relapsed due to shitty external circumstances that are not easily changed) and sometimes my libido returned at the lower dosages of my taper and other times it took days or weeks after I had completely quit. 

Bottom line: don‚Äôt worry about testosterone levels.  They can be normal or even high and it won‚Äôt make a difference. It‚Äôs the prolactin that is making you numb and uninterested in sex.",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.62136024}"

so it's been 11 days since I flushed this shit out of my system using naltrexone, and I've been doing pretty good all things considered (VERY long opiate and kratom abuse history here, total around 8-9 years, maybe 10 even, hard to tell at this point, last 4-5 years being kratom, last 1 of it being almost exclusively OPMS extracts and gold caps, upwards of 10 a day).

most importantly, I sleep very well. no issues falling asleep; if I wake up cuz I need to pee I fall right back to sleep. I take 300mg gabapentin at night, some Benadryl, and melatonin; usually have few light beers too; that combo knocks me out good; oh and I'm having dreams again! I missed having dreams so much! though not all dreams are pleasant I gotta admit ;) but I'll take what I can get!

appetite is back with vengeance and I'm actually enjoying food; I hope I will regain the weight I lost while using. yesterday I had PBJ sandwich for breakfast, at 11:30 I was starving so I went to a local Chinese joint, ate a HUGE plate of nudles with bourbon chicken. at night around 5-5:30 we got Papa Johns and I ate HALF a large cheese pizza, few cheese sticks, and some of my wife's Chinese food she ordered. TMI... I'm gonna take a HUGE dump today LOL :) so yea, I'm eating like a man should... I'm 6'4"" and used to be a muscular sculpture of 190 pounds of lean muscle... I'm barely touching 160 right now, and want it back! stop drooling ladies :P

libido is SLOWLY waking back up. slowly. but I did have a morning woodie once or twice and managed to rub one out few days ago so that's progress in my book.

what I did notice is that without kratom I lack the super human energy I used to have while on it; this has caused my bedtime / wakeup schedule to shift somewhat drastically. I have a very demanding software engineering / feature lead role where I'm actively working on a new feature with another senior engineer, and leading and architecting two other features with 4 junior engineers reporting to me, so my work hours are 10 sometimes more a day. yesterday I worked nearly 12 hours, and I was so tired in the evening that I went to sleep at 8pm. because of it I woke up at 5am, and been at work since 5:50am this morning. it's been like this since pretty much day 2 or 3 of this quit. I work my ass off and get so tired that the LATEST I've gone to sleep since quitting was 9:30pm I think, and the latest I woke up was 6am or so. I think this will stabilize back into normal hours as my body regains strength and weight.

luckily I have the mental energy to do my job! although I do take low dose adderall (yes it's prescribed) every morning which helps for sure, but I feel I would be fine without it; maybe I'll try this weekend. see how I feel.

physically I feel GREAT! the insane fatigue I was experiencing was pretty much there for the first 2-3 days, then rapidly improved and after day 5-6 was totally gone. since then as soon as I eat a good breakfast my body feels perfect. no lingering aches nor pains; I feel almost light on my feet. although I did catch a minor cold in the last couple of days which does cause me some body aches, few Advils take care of it right away.

mentally I think I'm stable, though I'm definitely experiencing a much wider range of emotions now; I feel greater joy from accomplishments, and I feel incredible sadness when listing to a sad song. I've also stopped taking my antidepressants several months ago, so that may be contributing to it. but I gotta say my base line is NORMAL, not depressed or anything like that. I did experience some anxiety the first 5-6 days, pretty bad at times, but haven't felt it since and I hope it stays that way :) I'm praying that by some miracle PAWS will skip me all-together ;) but so far no sign of  it, maybe except last weekend when after running errants all day Saturday wife and I sat down around 5pm, and there was nothing else for us to do, and I felt this uneasiness; like I was supposed to keep doing something but didn't know what, and it was hard for me to occupy my mind. it was also a slight feeling of sadness for a while, but then I cracked open a cold one and got busy making dinner and it passed.

now the challenge I think will be rebuilding normal person's habits. on kratom it didn't matter what I was doing... sober I need to be engaged either with another person or a book, podcast, article, blog, and those are not always east to find. not really sure how to start rebuilding those hobbies and interests, but I know I have to.

finally, I am still taking naltrexone, but not every day. I do know for a fact from past experiences that 25mg of it will pretty much block all effect of kratom FOR ME for at least 3 to 4 days. so I take it every 3-4 days or so. although it does not seam to affect me in any way, it does affect how I feel when I drink a little alcohol: it kills the happy buzz, and I sort of don't like that. I do like that I get pretty happy and chatty after a beer or two, but with naltrexone in full effect all I get is just intoxicated slightly. It's Wednesday morning now and last time I've taken 25mg was Sunday morning. I'll see how a beer affects me tonight; I hope it will be more pleasant than last night :P

anyways, it's been a LONG update, and I appreciate if you got this far :)

       Monday was my first official day of slowly cutting back from 20-30grams a day. I'm taking it slow so as to avoid at least some of the withdrawal symptoms. But i'm also partly wondering, how did you all go about quitting? tapering or cold turkey? And how did you keep yourself accountable through the process as to not slip? Thanks for reading, I hope you all have had a wonderful and productive day- without kratom :)

I did a fast, week long taper from 75g/day to 0 which I wrote a post about.  In the past 1.5 months I have had 2 setbacks, I took 1 teaspoon a day for 5 days straight which I wrote about in my post, and a couple days ago I took another teaspoon. On both setbacks I felt awful the next day. I had extremely strong cravings and felt like I lost all my progress (the 5 day setback was obviously worse). But I pushed through that post-kratom day both times, and both times, I felt fine the following day. So my advice is if you do have a setback, and the next day feel like all is lost, you have to push through it. For me, it just caused 1 bad day and then was back on track.  Of course you're better off not having a setback at all, and I'm sure these setbacks might extend my overall full-recovery time.",23,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.47679007}"

I have recently started slowing down my usage of OPMS extracts and have switched back to powdered Malaysion Kratom. I purchase the 1 oz sized bag, and that lasts me between 4-5 days. So, that is progress in terms of my usage, going from 3 OPMS shots a day for months to 1 every couple of days if I'm weak. 

The problem that prevails for me though (and I know will pass at some point) is the feeling of just being discontent. It feels like I'm constantly missing something, kind of like reaching for a drink and realizing one isn't there over, and over, and over, and over, and over, every single day. I get ups and downs, highs and lows; I will have moments of bliss where I feel great and am truly in the moment only to realize my current situation of not using and having it crash down which results in the worst knot in my stomach. Every time I get weak and dose, it is to avoid these feelings. I can't stand it! Because I am still using the powder, WDs haven't been too bad, but the mental feelings are my toughest enemy. I really have to start exercising because that is about the only thing I can think of that may help this. Doesn't help that my job is demanding and I'm constantly nervous about mistakes being made, fear of being in trouble - OPMS used to help that, make me sociable, not fearful - now I'm ruminating, anxious, and fearful.

I've never taken kratom or been an addict, but my husband has. He went from opiates to heroine and benzos to in-patient rehab to kratom. Not the right order it seems. 

He was completely free from withdrawal symptoms after rehab. But then started buying kratom for some reason. I do not approve, because he obviously has an addictive personality and now we are in way too much debt from his previous habit to even afford this stud anyways. Plus im scared because this stuff doesn't  seem to be  FDA related, and I don't know what's in it and what it can do to you. Hes already been to the ER because of headache and vision loss... plus he seems to have a lot more stomach problems like constipation and indigestion and nausea, not to mention light headedness and sleepiness ...

I've asked him to stop several times but each time he buys it anyway... is there a way to help him quit?  He always says he will stop then sneaks it anyways and never says anything until I catch him.. Is there a drug test for at home that is reliable so he will stop lying to me? We have enough trust issues as it is from previous problems, I dont want this to get worse for him or for our relationship :(

Edit: to clarify, he tries to play everything off like its normal...  I know I have trust issues so I might be reading too much into things... but even today today he kept dozing off multiple times on the couch then got irritated when I asked him if he was ok. And when he tried to be intimate tonight he couldn't finish...but idk if that's a sign of kratom or not.. it's just never been a problem before except when he was on heroin..",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.85197854}"

When I was tapering from subs prior to this and at the beginning of my transition from sub to Kratom, I was taking high doses of vitamin-c ascorbic acid (‚Äúbuffered c powder) as prescribed by my doctor (not the sub doctor, another practitioner) for opiate w/d.  Not really paying attention to how much it was helping, I became very irregular with my doses, and figured exercise and helper meds were the main things helping me.

Over the last week, every day below 10gpd was extremely rough.  I realized a couple of things:

My Dr prescribed 1 ‚Äúscoop‚Äù 4-5x per day, and his office sells the supplements he prescribed out of the office.  The exact one is also on Amazon:

https://www.amazon.com/Thorne-Research-Buffered-Magnesium-Potassium/dp/B005IZIXC4/ref=mp_s_a_1_6?keywords=buffered+vitamin+c&qid=1574135099&sprefix=buffered+&sr=8-6

I assumed a scoop was 1 gram, but it is actually ~2.6 grams. Very big difference. See my previous comments where I shared a medical study on the effectiveness of Vitamin C for opioid withdrawal.  My previous posts with my dosage amounts were based on my assumption about 1 scoop = 1 gram.   The actual prescribed dose is more in line with the medical study (~2.5 grams every few hours).  I took 4 scoops on Saturday and Sunday, and when I woke up today, I was not in withdrawal and was nowhere near as miserable as I have been over the last week.  

I tried ‚Äújumping‚Äù today, but caved when I had one bout of the sneezes at work. No ‚Äúskin crawling‚Äù or sweating/freezing.  There really weren‚Äôt any other symptoms, and I believe that if I had not brought my Kratom to work I would have gone the whole day without it and have been fine.  I ended up doing 1.5g Kratom in three doses (4.5 altogether). I feel physically much better tonight and the whole day than I have for the past week, despite tapering further on a ‚Äúfast‚Äù schedule and consuming even less Kratom.


 Either way, it is obvious to me that ‚Äúpre-loading‚Äù with those high doses days *before* withdrawal is a necessary part of the vitamin c opiate withdrawal medical protocol (and why it is noted in that study as ‚Äúcritical.‚Äù) Today is my third day of consistent, high dose C (2.6 grams of C, 4x on the previous 2 days, 5x today).  I am eager to see how tomorrow feels and whether I‚Äôll be able to get lower painlessly.  Today was painless. ~12.5 grams total vitamin c, no other changes to my regiment.",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.48187292}"

But the past week or so I've felt depressed, disconnected, even more unmotivated and antisocial than usual. Like I'm craving joy and happiness but I can't find it within myself.

Could this be paws or am I just stuck with this because the ""new"" real me is coming through? Or maybe just lack of sleep or something else attributing to my emotions...

I am on Day 8 of a very quick taper. I went from about 25 grams a day of white vein to now being at 2 grams a day. The only bad effects left are restless leg at night and a slightly irregular heartbeat. I also have somewhat low heart beats per minute (48-62 bpm).

I went to the doctor last Thursday when this heart irregularity started and I told her about my kratom use and discontinuance. She had given me beta blockers because on that day my hear was actually racing. I have since stopped the beta blocker medication at her guidance.

I don't have any previous heart issues, but my beats per minute remain low. My blood pressure is just slightly too low. I stopped the beta blockers last Friday and I'm still having an irregular heartbeat andchest pains with low heart rate.

Has anyone experienced permenant heart damage from using kratom? I basically used 25 grams per day for 5 years. If my heart is damaged, the I suppose I'll have to just deal with that because of the choice I made. But, I am hoping that it might not be permanently damaged.

Since I felt like shit and needed to perform, I went back up to 8 or so. 7.5 is the plan for today. My goal is to utilize my four day weekend for Thanksgiving break to go CT.  With my current taper schedule, I would be at 5g a day the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. Has anybody made the jump at this amount? Or should it be lower before I dive? 

It's a serious pain in the ass to grieve a relationship, but I think my fixation on solving this kratom problem actually helps me not think about her too much. 

I'm definitely determined to make a new beginning and kick ass at life again! This stuff makes me a selfish, unintelligent jerk and pushes all good things away.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.59533226}"

I am interested to hear about your experience with Kratom wobbles and/or tremors. A few colleagues of mine recently treated a patient that took ‚Äútoo much‚Äù Kratom, and came to the hospital complaining of ‚Äúwobbles‚Äù. Of course there is limited medical research as it relates to Kratom, so I decided to post in a forum to those with first hand experience. 

1. How much Kratom triggered the ‚Äúwobbles‚Äù for you? 

2. In your experience, is time the only thing that helps them go away?

3. Do you experience tremors while withdrawing from Kratom?

4. What is something you wish your physician understood (or did) to help you through Kratom withdrawals? 

Hopefully my questions are allowed in this forum. I appreciate it. 

Thanks!",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.59427524}"

Got my first OMVI. Only blew a .151, but that's all it takes. Have been sober ever since except I started taking Kratom about a month after the accident. I did break a bone in my back and somehow managed to do Ironman Ohio July 28th, 2019. I was prescribed tramadol for and a muscle relaxer. Anyhow, it ran out and I had some Kratom packets leftover my friend got me to try. I started taking it and was up to dosing 4x a day for probably 3 months straight. Then it got out of control towards the end. Right towards the end of my addiction, I ran a marathon (10/20/19) and qualified for Boston! I quit Kratom 9 days ago as of today 11/18/2019) and it has been hell.

I started exercising again on day 4 and yesterday somehow managed to do a 15K race with a bad hamstring.  I have never suffered so much in a race before ever! It was like 23 degrees at the start and I was FREEZING so I wore 3 layers of clothes.  But then I got hot flashes and wanted to rip everything off because I had the HOT SWEATS and my clothes were soaked so I'd get the chills.  Omg, I am never taking Kratom again!!  I am actually grateful the withdrawals for this drug have lasted this long because it makes me NEVER want to go through this shit again!  I just drank coffee and had to go change my clothes because my clothes got soaked in sweat again.  It's day 9!!! That is insane. I was once hooked on adderall for 6 years, but even adderall withdrawal was no big deal compared to this crap.  Off adderall I'd sleep for about 4 days straight and have anhedonia pretty bad, but it was nothing like this.  

Anyhow, I think exercise is super helpful!  I'm off to the gym now for spin class, swimming, hot tub, and gonna hit the steam room for a nice morning detox afterwards.

(READ THIS!),"This was originally posted on the Suboxone forum by another user (u/_need_answers__) I take no credit as I only found it. As far as I'm aware it works flawlessly for kratom too and at the very least it's worth a shot as a viable supplement to get you through those pesky w/d's. It should work very well with kratom, although Idk if it will work for heavy opiate dependence just as well as it will for light-medium opiate dependence.

When you hear of anyone claiming to have found a ""miracle cure"", 9 times out of 10 it is probably BS. But this is not. I discovered something that truly IS a miracle for opiate withdrawal of any kind (herion, methadone, suboxone, kratom, etc) and I will spend the rest of my life telling anyone and everyone who will listen.

High doses of Vitamin C has been studied and used for many years in the treatment of heroin withdrawal and the results have been astounding. Many doctors and scientists have fought to get the word out to the masses but it has been swept under the rug due to the amount of money that drug detox and rehabilitation centers would lose if everyone were aware of the true power of Vitamin C. 

How does it work? Empty opiate receptors is what causes withdrawal symptoms. Vitamin C occupies opiate receptors sites which is what it allivates withdrawls symptoms. When your opiate receptors are occupied, your body does not experience withdrawal. When the Vitamin C begins to wear off and leaves your opiate receptors, around 4 hours usually, your body goes back into withdrawal. It really does work and could help save SO many lives from opiate addiction if only more people knew about it. If anyone is interested in learning more about this, this video is a great place to start: https://youtu.be/5jUCZpIGnUY

Do your own research, try it for yourself and you will be convinced. As someone who personally used high does of Vitamin C to rapidly detox off of 24mg/day of Suboxone, I have some important notes that I want to share with you...

Vitamin C itself, even in massive amounts is nontoxic. However many Vitamin C products contain fillers or other vitamins which can be toxic in large amounts so you must be certain to purchase a product that only contains Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid).

You can not overdose on Vitamin C. Your body will absorb exactly how much it needs and you will poop out the rest. It is recommended to take Vitamin C ""to bowel tolerance"". Your bowel tolerance level will differ day to day depending on your body. If you are very ill, your bowel tolerance level will be higher because your body needs more Vitamin C. If you are healthy, it is likely to be much lower. Because again, your body will only absorb as much as it needs.

The doctors who devoted their lives to studying the incredible power of Vitamin C all say the same thing ""take Vitamin C until you are symptom free"". If you are still experiencing withdrawal symptoms but have not yet reached bowel tolerance, then you have not taken enough. 

Not all forms of Vitamin C are created equal. Vitamin C will not do you any good if your body can not absorb it. In my personal experience, I found Vitamin C tablets and chewables to be virtually useless due to their low and slow absorption rate. Vitamin C powder is absolutely the way to go. It absorbs very quickly. At the right amount, you will actually feel it working right away. You will feel a tingling sensation throughout your entire body and your withdrawal symptoms will quickly begin to subside. It may sound like magic, but as far as I am concerned, it truly is.

The amount and frequency that you will need will depend on the severity of your withdrawal symptoms on that particular day. Just to give you an idea, in clinical use, a daily total of 300mg/kg was used for patients in severe heroin withdrawal. I highly recommend taking it slow at first to get a feel for what your bowel tolerance level is. If you take too much, you may possibly poop your pants but that is the worst that will happen to you.

During the worst of my withdrawals, I needed 5,000mg three times a day to subdue my withdrawal symptoms. If I did not redose right before bed, I would wake up in the middle of the night right back in agonizing withdrawal. Towards the end of my detox, I only needed 2,000mg per dose. Once you feel your withdrawal symptoms beginning to creep back up, it is time to redose. 

You do not have to use organic Vitamin C. Sythenic Vitamin C has been studied and proven to be equally as effective in treating opiate withdrawal as natural Vitamin C. 

This is what I used: https://www.amazon.com/BulkSupplements-Ascorbic-Vitamin-Powder-kilogram/dp/B00AYIM9Y8/ref=mp_s_a_1_2_sspa?keywords=vitamin+c+powder&qid=1562455363&s=gateway&sprefix=vitamin+c+p&sr=8-2-spons&psc=1

Lastly, and I can not stress this enough, DRINK WATER!!! You must keep yourself well hydrated!

Vitamin C for opiate withdrawal is something that I wish was talked about more often. But sadly as we all know, if it doesn't make the pharmaceutical company money, then no one wants us to know about it. Even doctors will pooh-pooh the idea but you can not dispute the fact that it truly works.

Many folks are using Kratom to get through opiate withdrawal and although it is incredibly effective, you will likely be trading one addiction for another. Vitamin C is just as effective, even more affordable, very safe and is not addictive. Opiate withdrawal is just one of the countless things that Vitamin C is miraculous for. You will not only be amazed at how much better you feel in general, but how much better you look as well! 

Disclaimer: I am a recovering opiate addict sharing my own personal experience and the things that I have learned along the way in an attempt to help others out there like me. I am not a doctor and I encourage you to always do your own research.

If you have a friend going through opiate withdrawal or who wants to get clean but is scared of the detox, please share this with them. It is truly a life saving tool.

Using regularly since 2012, daily since 2014 with the occasional missed few days. 15-20 gpd. Wds not bad, some sneezing and headache. Feel a bit funny. Seeig where i really do need to learn to sit with my emotions. And realizing also I have to learn how to relax properly. Actually i fainted at work on my day 1 (and that's not even what prompted my quit, it was day 1 anyway.) As I ""rested comfortably"" waiting for the medics, I was thinking ""i need to learn to do this."" it was scary though, lots of factors besides kratom, but an image to keep in mind if I feel like relapsing. Realizing too I need to learn sobriety. I vaped too much THC in my last quit. Using the vape pen and edibles still, but know it can cause anxiety sometimes too. I know I need to learn to be comfortable with emotions and to be able to have pleasure and excapse without intoxicants. But when I'm sober I feel like ""This doesn't appeal to me that much."" But i'm doing okay overall really. A good workout today, got laundry and shit done, some laughs with my brother and nieces and nephews, music journaling and being on here. I'm better off without the kra and being strong to keep trying. Nice to come here to ramble read, and get encouragement. Have a good rest of your weekend everyone.

Last day 4 days ago the kratom dose was only 0.5g in the morning(one 00-cap), can't believe just a year ago I was at 50+gpd and dosing with a f\*\*\*\*\*\* spoon. It changed for the better when I got a capsule press and easily got down to 15gpd.

Anyway the day after I wake up very early just to take a dose of my homemade Iboga extract. Made it 2-3 years ago from root bark and have not tried it until now, 50mg!! was enough so this extract must be rather strong. I did a flood dose 4 years ago with 3g Ibogaine TA, it gave me some insights and a really clear(empty) mind for a few months.

I recently did some tests for IBS and now after more than 10 years of ""fighting"" it turns out I have IBD, not the best news, but this is a turning point. Soon turning 40 and it feels like I turned 30 yesterday, it's been a very difficult time. Especially the last few years, several broken discs in my back doesn't heal. Basically something has made me more or less handicapped, and the doctors made me believe it was mental issues, depression, anxiety, ptsd and stress.

I'm a good analytic so after reading up on my symptoms I was almost sure it was Ankylosing Spondylitis, I checked all the boxes, but it didn't feel correct. Some more reading lead me to IBS or leaky gut and I asked my doc to do some testing. FeCal above 400 indicates my guts have inflammation and I've been saying it feels like I'm a ""walking"" inflammation, but blood tests showed normal crp. I'm no quitter and sometimes it pays off, not to optimistic just yet, but it's better knowing than living in limbo.

First day off kratom I did 50mg Iboga extract and I got so tired I slept for maybe 5 more hours, felt sluggish when getting up. After a while I felt much better, almost great, better than microdosing LSD and it feels like my brain remember the flood dose in a unexplainable way. In the evening I went for a walk which I haven't been able to in several years, so the Iboga is activating after the first knock out phase.

Second day I had 100mg Iboga extract, just the taste of it works as a switch in my brain. Looked at the kratom capsules I got left in my shelf and stored them somewhere out of sight. No urge to take one, similar feeling to quitting antidepressants when you start feeling like yourself again. Clearly the kratom has made me feel apathetic?(lazy).

Day 3(today) 100mg Iboga extract, it's dark, cold and shitty weather outside, but its saturday so I just go back to sleep as ""usual"". Wake up before noon, not much lighter outside(live in north europe way up). Usually I'd get depressed and kratom helped even though I was still a couch potato. Not as a result of the kratom, but having a autoimmune desease for so many years without knowing.

Tomorrow or actually tonight I'm considering taking the Iboga before I go to bed to test that approach, maybe less sluggish when waking up.

So far no withdrawal symptoms like I experienced last spring when I ran out while on vacation. From 10g to 0g, nose started running and body aches next day. Taper to success, CT can work if you're healthy I guess.",5,{'immun': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43799782}"

Of course my sleep wasnt great but good, and also I have a pretty strong desire to relapse today cause I'm bored and wired and is also sounds really fun getting a high. But using multivitamins and watching movies as well as other supps over past 5 days has helped me get to this point and I'm sooo happy I can finally feel the worst is over of the withdrawal.

This evening will mark **35 DAYS / 5 WEEKS** since my **final Green Malay dose on October 11th**. I was serving a **10-20 GPD** prison sentence for **6 months** (a relapse from a 1 year 1 month quit from a couple years of frequent use).

Lately, when I experience a moment of stress or discomfort, I can sit back and indulge in the fact that I successfully cut off a very addictive habit and no matter what I am better off than I was 5 weeks ago. Yesterday I realized how nice it was to not have to make impulsive 30 minute trips to the head shop to spend money on a drug to keep myself from feeling anxious and uncomfortable in my skin. It is a major relief to not have to factor this drug dependency into my daily schedule. No matter what happens in my day, I HAVE THAT to be grateful and calm for.

I have been waking up at 5:30 AM almost every day and it‚Äôs noticeably easier to get up then it was during Kratom usage. I still have morning stomach aches (my quest is to figure out stomach health) but **I don‚Äôt have sleepy opiate hangovers**. For the most part, I have had balanced energy throughout the day. If I am having a bad feeling or moment, it passes very quickly. I am in control of my reactions because I am not constantly preoccupied with nurturing and nursing a chemical balance in my body. I am feeling more excited about life and I have had many moments of calmness and contentment that I fully appreciate.

I am able to take things less seriously and it‚Äôs easier for me to disconnect from my ego and my egoic thoughts. I am able to express compassion and genuine interest towards people in conversations (plus the lovely non-guilt eye contact -- can anyone relate?). My confidence has gone up and **my paradigm has shifted as far as what I am capable of**.

I weighed myself at the doctor on Monday and I have gained 9-10 pounds of healthy weight. Like many other people, I would skip eating to feel the euphoria of Kratom. This was keeping me skinny, malnourished, weak and irritable (Fight or Flight all day baby!). I believe that my face has gained back weight as well as the rest of my body (muscles are fuller). It feels so good mentally and physically to give care to my body by eating regularly! Calm body!

I am looking forward to more clarity and calmness as the brain fog continues to lift. I am a creative person and lately I have felt lost about my purpose in life (Kratom blocks motivation and critical thinking in my opinion). I type in my Quitting Kratom journal every day and  I have over 150 pages written since October 11th. I thought about the idea of making a Quitting Kratom book of some sort. I am pretty passionate about my journey and I believe that I could help others. Do you guys think that would be a cool idea?

Some of the emotions and feelings I‚Äôve been through I would not wish on my worst enemy. I would like to help people in getting through this hell. I stay mindful every single day and I'm not letting my guard down. I believe if you want to successfully quit this addictive substance, you have to make the commitment to make it your biggest priority (outside of paying bills obviously). Making time to read quittingkratom on Reddit is very important to me and I consider it ""working on my recovery"".

I always knew I had an addictive personality, but nothing got me as bad as kratom. Looking back at the last 5 years, I've accomplished nothing. I am a bonified drug addict. Although my finances are ok, I am no different than those people whom everyone despises on the streets. Yet I identify with them more than my next door neighbor. 

I've quit kratom many many times. I also failed many many times. I quit for a month, then relapse for a month or two, then the cycle continues. I am in the middle of a relapse, a cple of months on 50+ grams per day. I have all of the comfort meds anyone needs, I've done this so many times. But with all of the failures, all of the times I promised I would never go back, I've failed every single time. 

I feel like a prisoner, on or off kratom. I feel like it is only a matter of time before I relapse, so why even quit? I despise ever finding this fucking plant, but this plant also shown me how something can bring you to your knees. This plant and addiction has brought me so much pain, so much disappointment, so much failure that it has fundamentally changed me. 

I'm trying to be positive about my day 1 quit starting tomorrow. But I can't help to think that I will fail. Why am I doing this to myself over and over again. How much has my body struggled to get better over and over again. How much more medicine do I have to juggle just to get over kratom withdrawals?

Such a shit fucked life these last 5 years. The worst 5 years of my life by far. But I can't lose anymore. I can't let myself go down like this. I gotta make something of myself because time is running out, life is too short for this fucking addiction owning me.

2019-11-14 19:33:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/dwiq1t/my_fix_all/,my fix all,"First I would like to say that I pretty much go to reddit for answers to most general questions I have , but only recently made an account as to post what I'm currently going through. So this is my first post.

Since I was a teenager I have had issues with alcohol and other substances mainly to deal with social anxiety and general anxiety that seems to paralyze me sometimes and has affected my life in almost every aspect and limited me, to which I resent. The way I was able to deal with my anxiety was through exercise and I have played basketball my whole life. A couple years ago I got into some trouble and violated my probation, in which I was given the option to go to a treatment/jail facility for around 7 months. I did well and made it home( to a different city where I didn't know anyone other than my mom and grandparents) but feel severely depressed to where I could not function. I started taking Kratom and immediately all of my depression was alleviated, my anxiety was put on mute, and I was able to be proactive and productive in ways that I haven't before. I had multiple promotions at my job ( which I actually held for a substantial time for once) and gained back the trust of my family. After a while I began to notice that I could no longer function if I didn't take Kratom multiple times a day, not even being able to walk down the street to the store, etc. I was spending around 1/3 of my money on Kratom and started to realize I had to quit, but I didn't know how I would hold my job without it. The Kratom use lasted about 15 months, an an everyday habit, maybe around 20 - 25 mgs a day, rotating strains, capsules, toss and wash, etc. 

About 2 and a half months ago I had the brilliant idea that I could just start drinking again to get myself off the Kratom then I could stop drinking. Then I began drinking( around a pint to a fifth of deep Eddys vodka and lemonade) most every night, blacking out every time, and still was taking Kratom just not as frequently. Realizing I now had gained another problem I began using Benzos to try and kill the Kratom and alcohol, all the while gaining dependence on the Benzo. Eventually I quit all 3 after having a serious breakdown and a couple health scares, landing in the emergency room for delirium tremens a week later. It has been 3 and a half weeks since I was in the hospital while today I feel a little better, most days have been a living hell filled with severe anxiety, delusions, paranoia, insomnia, feeling like Im actually dead and in hell, feeling like when everyone goes to sleep something starts messing with my mind and I can't be alone, panic attacks, brain zaps before falling asleep making I impossible,  and such. I have also been diagnosed with PTSD from things that happened in my home town and possibly borderline bipolar which my mom has. I can't seem to find any doctors around here that take me seriously because of my past and getting into a psychiatrist is going to take a while. I am desperate for answers and constantly am googling stuff to get some reassurance that things will be ok. I spent most of the last 15 months only using Kratom with some drinking spurts in between. Can anybody tell me if im actually losing my mind or is this from ptsd? withdrawals? 

Sorry for such a long post but I really don't have anyone around me to talk to or that understands, also Im not even staying at home right now because we discovered that there at LEAST a few rats in the duplex and upon seeing my first ever large rat up close and personal without warning I quickly panicked and was thrust more quickly into delusional phase I was/am in. Anyways any help would be appreciated again sorry for such a long post and rambling!!",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.48317176}"

40 gpd 1 year.  I did a ton of studies about the benefit of phycodelics in the treatment of addiction and depression after the discontinued use of opiates and alcohol.   
I decided to try Ayahuasca and after three ceremonys I no longer had any desire to use kratom or drink.  I felt amazing for months.  
I used Ayahuasca two weeks after tapering from kratom.   My rls stopped and cravings gone like a light switch.  I did have a touch of anadonia.   three months later I started to micodose mushrooms and immediately felt relief from all depression.  
Studies from major medical research has shown amazing results for the treatment of addiction, depression, PTSD, 
I am 9 months clean and have never felt better.  I don't think about getting high.  my anxiety is completely gone.  I felt this way right after tried phycodelics.   I don't advocate using phycodelics to trip full on.  Very small doses that don't have any mind altering effects are just as beneficial.   
microdosing is taking very small doses over the course of only a few weeks.  once past the depression and addiction you quit taking phycodelics.  benefits last months.

I have about a 25-30 gpd habit. I got sober from alcohol on new years 11 months ago, and now I don't like the thought that kratom is still fogging my head, affecting my memory, blocking my sex-drive and my general overall well-being with this nagging addiction often dominating my thoughts. 

Since alcohol was an issue for a decade, I have a bottle of Naltrexone. I've actually taken naltrexone while having a kratom habit and have precipitated a withdrawal a couple times, but i attributed pretty much everything I had experience to alcohol or a weird reaction to the pill. It is a very uncomfortable experience but it's worth it to me. Also, I don't know how to make LDN (low dose naltrexone) from the pills. Not sure if I can dissolve it in a jug or what. 

I'm asking for anyone who has experience using naltrexone to quit kratom to please lay whatever helpful information you may have on me if you would. Any and all potentially useful information is greatly appreciated.

It only started getting hard once I got to half my normal dose, & it seems to be getting even harder the lower my doses get.

I have to dose every 3 hours (so 6x/day), else I start to withdraw. MTuW of this week I got my dose down to 750mg 6x/day. ThFSaSu, I've gotten my dose down to 500mg 6x/day, meaning I take now take 3g/day.

Would I be able to jump off 3g/day Monday without any serious withdrawals, given my utter abuse of the substance for 8 months straight? I've been using 1g Agmatine daily, also. Or should I drop to 250mg 6x/day MTuWTh, & perhaps even 125mg FSaSu, then stop?

Part of it was forced, which puts me in the danger zone still; i stopped buying the OPMS bottles because I simply ran out of $ on Monday. So, with what remaining $ i had left, I bought a 1 oz bag of Malaysion Kratom that still has a few doses left in it. I bought 1 OPMS bottle on Monday, and 1 OPMS bottle today out of weakness. Despite myself still feeling negative about caving and buying any at all, my victories are 1) i have not bought more than 1 bottle each day 2) I went Tuesday and Wednesday buying 0 OPMS bottles, only dosing small amounts of powder. I feel bad about caving and buying one today, but overall I think I am off to a good start. We'll see how this goes. As long as my normal doses are WAY WAY less than what i usually do (3 opms bottles a day) I should be happy. Techncically I could imagine keeping my dose to 1 OPMS bottle a day would be a victory and considered tapering, but they're so expensive that I dont even wanna touch the stuff.

I started to comment but my response got really long winded so I thought I‚Äôd just make it a stand-alone post. 

I‚Äôm at Day 43CT. What I did early on and continue to do today is use thought-stopping and reality checking. These are both just basic cognitive-behavioral coping skills you‚Äôd learn in therapy or mindfulness classes. 

When I feel the negative emotions start to come, I‚Äôve trained myself to notice the thought I‚Äôm having, bring it to my conscious attention, and examine it logically. I tend to catastrophize so I usually ask myself something like ‚Äúis anyone going to die/get hurt if X does/does not happen?‚Äù In 100% of the cases so far, I have determines that the answer is No. 

From there, I can do more reality checking: Would doing X benefit me/make me happy/result in something positive for my family? What from my past experiences might be causing this negative reaction? Is this violating my boundaries? Is it really my responsibility to do X or am I saying yes out of guilt/fear/obligation (especially with work)?

I think PAWS is real but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs some nebulous/unexplainable condition. I think it‚Äôs simply the result of us addicts having to face the totally normal highs and lows of life without our old safety net of chemicals to change our reactions to reality. Instead of numbing the bad feelings and zoning out the bad thoughts, we have to consciously develop the skill to deal with them.

yesterday, day 2, the fatigue was un-f'ing-real from the moment I woke up till about 2-3pm when I finally felt some energy coming back. after that I was OOOKKK for the rest of the day. got home last night, had few glasses of wine, dinner, downed 1200mg of gabapentin and I actually sleep some last night :) the previous two nights were ZERO sleep. this night I passed out around 8pm and woke up at 4am. I immediately got up, took a shower and headed to work.

it's 7am now, and the fatigue is MUCH MUCH BETTER than what it was yesterday; I can still feel some of it, but it's maybe 10% of what I felt yesterday. gonna have some breakfast soon and I suspect it will make me feel even better.

after the initial precipitated withdrawal 3 days ago, I haven't had ANY body aches or anything like that; body feel 100% back to normal other than the fatigue which appears to be improving rapidly :)

yesterday, when the fatigue was really wearing me down and I though it would break me, I took 25mg of naltrexone, JUST IN CASE. around the time I took it, the fatigue disappeared LOL. oh well. I'll be taking a smaller dose of naltrexone every couple of day I think. I know from previous experience that 25mg will block all effect of kratom for 3 days for me, so no need to take it daily. besides I want to have my receptors unplugged once in a while so I can actually enjoy an alcoholic beverage ;)

I am already 90% better than where I was 3 days ago, and I hope to God it will be even better tomorrow. one other thing, the first two days I experienced incredible depression and sadness, I don't have any of those feeling today; in fact, my mind feels... fine, just fine. I'm neither happy nor sad, just normal I guess... I hope.

good luck everyone!!!

P.S. EDIT TO ADD: my last run with kratom lasted several months and I was taking between 6 to 10 OPMS Gold Caps DAILY. so yea, stupid amount of K. previous run with kratom was about 4 years long, and 99% of it was OPMS Silver Caps (2 to 4 times a day, 8g per dose), with an extract once a week maybe. so pretty heavy use history here... :(",5,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.8809805}"

Continuing to struggle with getting the courage to start to taper. I need to find a Doctor to help me with my anxiety. I literally feel like I can‚Äôt go through my day sane without using Kratom because of anxiety.  I think it‚Äôs just from the beginning stages of withdrawal. I have always been anxious but not like this. I want my life back. My goal is to take Friday off and research psychiatrists and schedule an appointment with a couple.  Then to figure out a taper plan.  I have a trip planned for Mexico in February so my goal is to be off by then. I am taking  30-40 gpd spread out in 4 doses. I am thinking to taper down 1 gram every 3 days.  I have taken Kratom for exactly 1 year.

Without you I would have made this journey completely alone.  My circumstances (career/wife) require that my kratom life remain in the shadows.  Even though  I've been a lurker I still felt like a part of this community.  

I used kratom everyday all day during two periods of usage that totaled 5-6 years.  I was high for my daughters birth.  I was high at my moms funeral.  I was high at my brothers funeral.  I was high when I lost my job of nearly 15 years when I had planned to retire at twenty (military). I passed on trips to England, Costa Rica, Philippines and others to remain close to my addiction.  My schedule was to dose every two waking hours but in truth I would dose before doing anything.  Before grocery shopping. Before a movie. Before a drive into town.  Before a task at work.  Before exercising.  Before a meeting.  Before doing the lawn.  Before dinner out.  Before family events.  Before opening Christmas presents...  Kratom came before life.  

I quit CT after the first 2 to 2.5 years.  At the time I had the luxury of unemployment and  I remember four days of sleepless hell.  I holed up in the bedroom and put my wife through an event that I'm ashamed to have subjected her to.  She has found my stash before and discovered the existence of my secret PO box but she does not know how out of control and controlled I became.  

I remained clean for about a year but ended up relapsing head first after I  joined the military again.  The military has a drug policy that includes all intoxicants that aren't alcohol so I lived everyday with my job in jeopardy.  Luckily they don't screen for kratom yet.  I carried a Skoal can filled with kratom and a broken teaspoon everywhere I went.  Ducking out constantly to dose is stressful but admittedly I sometimes got a juvenile rush like I was getting away with something.  Sometimes I would dose when a coworkers back was turned.  Maybe part of me wanted to get caught. 

Fast forward to August of this year and my marriage is falling apart.  She cheated on me and left one day with our daughter.  I'm mad of course but I certainly didn't help the situation.  Years of me not wanting to do anything that interfered with dosing and zero libido took its toll.  I'm not sure if we'll work things out or not.   Which brings me to quit number two.  I don't want to navigate another crossroad of my life with this bullshit plant on my mind constantly.  

The first thing I did was figure out how much I was taking which was between 30 and 50 gpd using a digital scale.  Initially I stuck to my one tsp per two waking hours routine with the exception of cutting out all the in between doses.  At that point I felt less sedated but no withdrawals.  Next I moved to a 1/2 tsp every two hours and that's when the pain came in.  I hovered at this amount for awhile because the withdrawals were bearable but definitely uncomfortable.  The state of my personal life and work required I remain functional.   

After reading many posts here I decided to arm myself with some tools to proceed with the taper.  Through Amazon I ordered a capsule press,  00 gelatin capsules, and a massive amount of supplements.  I'm sure I went overboard but what the hell.  If this works I'm going to save a ton of money down the road.  I bought most of the commonly mentioned ones.

* Ashwagandha
* Black Seed Oil
* Magnesium
* Mega Dose Vitamin C
* L-theanine
* L-tyrosine
* L-dopa
* Rhodiola Rosea
* Green Tea Extract
* Melatonin
* Agmatine

So I turned my kitchen table into a kratom capsule press factory  which ended up oddly satisfying.  It was nice to have something to keep me busy after work.  I felt like I was actively pursuing a goal via capsule making, supplement research and all day reading of this subreddit to come up with a master plan.  Already I was happy about my decision to leave kratom even though I felt like crap 24/7.  

With some capsules made I reduced my dosage to 3 caps every two hours even at night because I would automatically wake up to take it.  I realize 00 caps usually come in at .5 grams but I never packed mine so they were more like .4.  After stabilizing at that amount I moved to 2 caps at the same interval.  I experimented with 0 size capsules but it seemed like too much work because I was burnt out on capsule pressing.  Me being me I probably made a couple thousand 00 kratom caps.  Overtime instead of dosing every two hours it went to three and then 1 cap every three.  And so it went I continued to space the 1 cap dose out further 3, 4, and 6 hours like clockwork.  I didn't set any rules for how long I'd stay at each amount.  My main concern was stabilizing to remain functional.  Eventually I made it to one .4g at 4 o'clock in the morning but that only lasted a few days because I saw an opening to take some leave from work combined with a three day weekend (YAY veterans day!)  

That was seven days ago and I haven't touched kratom since.  Ok I touched it once and thats only because I found a earbud pouch filled with caps in my work pants.  The garbage disposal was happy to eat those.  

What have I learned. Well over planning and seeking refuge in this subreddit was invaluable.  I obsessively read the success stories of slow taper folks like Gregnice and Steeleplate.  There's dozens more but I couldn't help but to be struck by the humor and beauty people expressed in their words.  Hope radiated from my laptop, tablet, and phone.  Running throughout this process has been a godsend.  If kratom gifted me anything it was ability to run thousands of miles over the past couple years.  I loved zoning out and running to combine the highs.  Luckily the kratom free high might just be better although it was a battle to even lace my shoes after the first bigs cuts.  My diet was already in check because of being a runner so Im sure that helped.  Did the supplements help?  I don't know honestly, but they didn't hurt either.  All the researching and planning kept my head in the game so thank you Amazon!  Like I mentioned earlier my wife and I are separated.  Under normal circumstances this would be terrible but it actually allowed me to pursue this taper without sneaking around.  Something I found to be a great relief.  I would hate to go through another juncture of my life in a fog.  

Today I feel completely out of kratom's grip.  I'm happy but emotionally flatlined most of the time.  The anxiety still strikes throughout the day but it's all very manageable.  Music, books, and shows sometimes hit me hard as commonly reported.  I read a dark novel called ""A Cosmology of Monsters"" and man I weeped at its poignant ending.  So right now life is mostly valleys with a few surprising peaks and I'm ok with that.  Trying to make each day a continuous peak was never going to work.  I look forward to a life without the guilt of dependance, lies and subterfuge required to support it.

I just tapered off the Ambien also, first cutting the pill in half for a few days, then taking only a quarter pill for a few days.  Sleep was about 5 hours the first two nights on zero ambien , but restless legs are almost gone now‚Äîjust get random waves now that don‚Äôt last long.  Last night got 8 hours sleep naturally and feel great.  

Exercise and hot baths have been helpful.  I have been eating more junk food since quitting and gained a few pounds.  I hope to reverse this and not turn to food for anxiety relief or relaxation I get from eating a lot of carbs.  The anxiety and aches and pains have improved in week 4.  

Another noticeable effect of quitting has been lack of motivation to complete tasks and lower energy.  This is improving very slowly and the anxiety is starting to go down too.  

In summary, my 4th time quitting has been similar to the past times in that major improvements occurred at day 20-25 area...main difference this time was the caffeine sensitivity in the first few weeks (which went away last week).  I will be working hard to stay away from all rx pills and Kratom, as the 4-8 week mark is the danger time for relapse.

Used it to come off of a tramadol addiction about 3 years ago, and have found myself taking A LOT in the last 2 years.  By a lot i mean 9 doses a day, 6-8 1g capsules/dose for a total of about 53g/d.  Every day.  No exceptions.  I have never tried quitting before now, and Saturday was a typical 50g day for me, except I missed my last few doses which I've never done before.  I woke up Sunday feeling like shit, body aches like I never knew existed.  My lower back is sore, my wrists are sore, everything is sore.  Can't get comfortable, sleeping all day in 2hr bursts.  Wanting to literally die to avoid the pain.  Throughout the day I took a 4g dose, then 2 3g doses to help alleviate.  It sort of helped, but not really.  I think my body is expecting so much more and its punishing me for denying it.  

I felt like crap again today, Monday.  Called off work, and laid on the couch all day sleeping on and off.  Body aches and soreness.  I am considering today as my first day of CT since i still dosed a little yesterday, but i would have to put the symptoms at 8/10 versus yesterday's 11/10.  I have no energy or motivation to do anything.  No interest in food.  Skipping my workouts and watching myself lose my progress with weightlifting over the past two months really sucks.  

Found this subreddit today and have spent two hours reading for motivation.  I never noticed the negative effects of kratom that others here have mentioned.  I love how it helped give me energy for long workouts, and curbed all my cravings so that I could lose a bunch of weight.  The real downside for me has been the sneaking away to dose or hiding my bottles, and the money...good god I spend so much on the stuff.  A single bottle will maybe last me 4-5 days and at $80 per bottle I'm spending about $600/mo on this addiction.

I started with ULDN probably about 10mcg or less, first thing in the morning at least 30 mins before taking Kratom. (this is the way you're supposed to take it.) But most of the time i took it just a couple minutes before. 
I used it to taper along with Black seed oil to potentiate the kratom. I was able to drop from a tablespoon per dose to a teaspoon per dose in about 10 days, and I was still feeling good every dose too. 
Each day, at least 6 hours after the last dose id take my ULDN then Kratom. Each time I used a little bit less. 
A month or 2 later I was down to a teaspoon 2 times a day. 
My goals were finding the sweet spot with the uldn, not using it too soon after the last Kratom dose, gradually escalating the dose every couple days. 
And when it comes time to quit, my goal was to increase my ULDN dose more, using it every 8 hours. You will feel great for a few days at this point but then you'll need to cut down or skip a day because it does make you sleep less. I sleep 5 or 6 hours instead of usual 8 or 9. I can do this for a few days and feel great but then I need to bring the dose down or not take it for a night, still taking it during the day. 
It's making it feel like my recovery is going a lot faster too. 
Don't get me wrong, this stuff is incredible and will make this so much easier for you. But more powerful than any drug is your mind. Your commitment to help yourself is going to be key. 
Give advice to yourself as you would a friend going through your situation. ""feeling low? Why not go get some sun or take a shower, or go for a walk? Try working out lately man?"" 

When I needed to not be depressed before going out, I had cacao to resort to. It was a huge help.  Just a tablespoon or two and you're not so depressed. 

Also check out the Wim Hof method. It's a combination of a breathing exercise and cold exposure. Literally is changing my life man. Every day I used to feel so much dread, anxiety, I've been suicidally depressed for years self medicating, just hanging on for hope of a better tomorrow. Life is getting better for me and I don't feel like an empty void. But it's not just this method or ULDN, its a complete change in your life. You simply can't expect life to be the same without kratom. And that's a GOOD thing. You create your own future. 

Hold on to this post. Read it over and over. Come to me if you have any questions. I'll try to help the best I can, this won't be easy, I don't know everything. 
Sometimes we just need a friend.

Update: this was me about 6 months ago. I've found out I had some underlying mental illness. I'd be guessing at what it is besides anxiety and ADHD, but it's mostly resolved with a lot of work and taking lithium orotate, mindfulness, meditation, exercise, and cold showers. The biggest change for me lately has been Nofap, no porn or masturbating. I'm at 3 and a half weeks now and my life hasnt been this good in years.  I've made some friends. I'm popular at work, in fact I was told I'm being looked at for a promotion. Then they found out afterwards since I'm not even a permanent employee yet I'll have to wait till after. 

I actually feel good inside my own body now. I've overcome many thought patterns, many depressions, panic attacks, anger episodes and all sorts of other things. And I'm still here, alive and actually kinda happy.

My question is, at what point is a regular dosage of Kratom low enough to begin using naltrexone therapeutically (5-50mg)? I don't mind some withdrawal symptoms, but I also would rather avoid spending the night curled in a ball on my bathroom floor.

The last few days have been very challenging for me. I have been sick going on 3 weeks now and it is getting very frustrating. Yesterday was the most I have considered dosing Kratom since quitting 30 days ago. I did not consider it enough for it to become a stressful mental battle but I became very angry that I considered it. I did not consider it because I wanted to feel high. The thoughts of going to buy a dose crossed my mind for RELIEF because nothing seems to be helping me get over this cold. Kratom has thrashed my immune system. I have been coughing phlegm since basically the second week of quitting and I seemed to be getting over it and then a NEW COLD hit. It is absolutely insane and relentless.

I am making green smoothies, exercising, yoga, going to bed before 10 PM to get the best sleep possible, and I'm taking all the recommended cold medicines and crap. Still sick. It is freaky thinking that my immune system is this messed up. I am in a new relationship (thankfully she is very supportive) and I've basically had to spend my weekends in bed trying to recover instead of getting to go do fun stuff. This very much resembles a prison sentence or like some kind of work release ha.

The PAWS come and go on difference days. Last night I had the chills. The last couple of days I have had the unpredictable fatigue thing where you feel up to doing something and you get there and it's TIME TO LAY DOWN.

After 30 days it's getting frustrating and it often feels like my endurance is wearing thin. To me this is the hardest part of the recovery process because symptoms are unpredictable and random.

BUT ! OVERALL, I would say that the PAWS are fading. If I wasn't sick yesterday I would have felt pretty normal.

I had a moment of rage today which is rare for me. I was trying to find a walk-in clinic to finally concede for medical help (I hate dealing with insurance and medical places so I avoid it as long as possible). The person talking on the phone at my doctor's office could not validate my insurance and he offered the solution of going somewhere and paying out of pocket and that they have ""payment plans"". This triggered me. I got short with him ""why the hell would I want to spend a fortune on medical costs when I have private insurance (UnitedHealth)"". He just didn't know what he was doing in looking it up.

Anyways, without a millisecond of mindfulness, I slammed my iPhone on the table and shattered it!

I am not going to relapse on Green Malay but I'm just extremely frustrated. I want my immune system back.

If anyone has any words of encouragement or advice I would greatly appreciate it! Thanks for reading! I am now going to take control of the rest of my day.",5,{'immun': 3},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.82598495}"

All jokes aside, I feel basically the same, runny nose, fever, nauseous, weak, foggy headed, and overall like I‚Äôm drained. I have to go to my day job so let‚Äôs hope I don‚Äôt have another episode again today! It has come to my attention that some people here feel that I‚Äôm giving bad advice on how to properly withdraw from Kratom. This is false, BECAUSE IN NO WAY AM I ADVISING ANYONE TO FOLLOW MY DETOX!! I‚Äôm just giving you my RAW, HONEST, AND UNCUT VERSION OF MY DETOX! It should be noted that I am not only detoxing from Kratom but I am also detoxing from Adderal as well. This is what using Kratom and Adderal for 3 Consecutive Years Straight will look and feel like. I am aware that tapering is the safest route along with going to the doctor and taking prescription medication administered by the doctors. HOWEVER, most people can‚Äôt afford Medical Insurance or afford to pay for the doctor visits, that is why I‚Äôm so stubborn on going to see my doctor to appeal to the general public. I will only go if I certainly feel that I‚Äôm going to die. Again, I can‚Äôt stress this enough, PLEASE DON‚ÄôT ASSUME THAT MY WAY OF DETOXING IS SAFE AND PLEASE DON‚ÄôT ATTEMPT TO FOLLOW ME JUST YET!! In good faith, I can‚Äôt say that it‚Äôs safe at all. I have to see if I survive this first, and I have to see if I caused any permanent damage to my body due to my CT detox. Research provers that long periods of drug abuse MUST be tapered off not CT, so with that being said (DON‚ÄôT DO WHAT I‚ÄôM DOING). Also on a separate not another member of this sub has told me that what I‚Äôm doing can potentially put fear in other Kratom users and have the adverse effects such as ‚Äúholy shit Karma is going through this shit, fuck that I‚Äôll just continue to use Kratom to avoid feeling like him‚Äù THAT IS NOT MY INTENTION!! I don‚Äôt want anybody to feel afraid to quit! Again, I‚Äôm not only withdrawing from KRATOM but ADDERAL as well! So maybe Kratom withdrawal is less intense then withdrawing from Adderal, shit I‚Äôm withdrawing from both drugs at the same damn time! That should tell you that my experience will be way more painful and unpleasant than withdrawing from just Kratom. This is my personal journal guys, not a guide for you to follow. I am not trying to scare people away from sobriety by telling you how I feel and how my body feels or the pain that I‚Äôm going through. I‚Äôm giving you what I‚Äôm experiencing down to the perfect detail to properly explain what I‚Äôm feeling. So just sit back and relax and read my posts, just please don‚Äôt follow my detox this is not a guide book guys and girls. Don‚Äôt play with your health, it‚Äôs just not safe. With that being said, WISH ME LUCK! Oh and fuck you Kratom if I die put a 1,000 kilos of Maeng Da and Red Vein Bali in my coffin so I can shove it down the devils throat and asshole when I see his bitch ass! Thank you all for your support. Oh and do you think that if the devil or whatever runs hell can get addicted to Kratom? I hope so, so they can experience the feeling of extreme constipation!

Saturday I celebrated 6 full weeks Kratom-free. Very happy about that. I feel I am ultimately one of the very lucky ones in this addiction and recovery scenario, as my withdrawal symptoms dissipated very fully, though that took me longer than it has taken others. Where I really lucked out is in the PAWS department. I recognize some symptoms but since the end of my third week, everything has been pretty straightforward. Except, of course, for sleep.

If you look at my post history, you will see that any check-in I've done, I mention not sleeping well. The first couple weeks were absolute hell. Barely slept at all. Constantly tired but unable to fall into sleep. I'd lie there, desperate for unconsciousness, my body fully exercised, caffeine out of my system, kratom-free, and it just wouldn't happen for hours. After about 10 days I started using sleep aids (primarily ativan) but I limited my use to no more than every 5 days in order to avoid dependence on that.

As time went on, things improved, but they did so in - what felt like - 10 minute increments each night. It would still take me forever to fall asleep, I'd still wake up all the time. But it seemed like each night I was getting maybe just a little more sleep. The Ativan and a couple other sleep aids would help force my body to sleep but that sleep always felt unearned. Necessary to keep the machine functioning but not a sign of real recovery.

As of last week, I'd say I was starting to sleep well enough to not be miserable. It was still taking me on average an hour and fifteen minutes to fall asleep but from there, I was always getting a couple solid 1.5-2 hour blocks of sleep. I was happy about all this of course, and tried to take even fewer sleep aides. I was definitely doing better but none of it was anything like life before Kratom and I always had that sinking suspicion that maybe I broke myself and would never sleep normally again.

This weekend, I did a 48 hour fast. I've talked a little bit on here about fasting as part of Kratom recovery. Such activity is *not* for everyone, but I've been a big fan of fasting. In part because falling into food addiction and food as comfort is a pretty easy step for me to take when I quit a substance. I knew there was a big danger in that post-Kratom and I knew like Kratom abuse, becoming addicted to food, and using food as emotional support was an insidious and slow process that always started with me failing to understand the difference between being biologically hungry (needing fuel) and emotionally hungry (needing to comfort myself by eating stuff that tastes and makes me feel good). Fasting *really* helps me to get a concrete understanding of those differences

The other huge benefit of fasting is autophagy (google it. I am the *wrong* person to try and explain) and while I have zero scientific evidence to back this up, I suspect autophagy might play a role in helping with recovery. Again, I have no way of validating this and I may be totally wrong, but it's a suspicion I have. And I've certainly noticed a marked improvement in all my post-Kratom symptoms since I started fasting more regularly. 

Anyway, to wrap this all up: I fasted from Friday afternoon through Sunday afternoon, celebrating my six week quit in the middle there. Sunday night, after a delicious, nutrient dense break from the fast, I went to bed and fell asleep within 20 minutes, sleeping without waking up for 7 hours. Further, my sleep tracker told me I got a solid 1 hour and 40 minutes of deep sleep. I usually get an hour or less. Further, I didn't wake up once during the night. I slept exactly the way I used to sleep. I woke up feeling rested and remembering a little bit of my old self and my old life.

This is a big breakthrough for me. I imagine in the days to come there will be some, even many, nights where my sleep isn't this good. But I also believe that those Regular Sleep nights will start to pop up more regularly until they become the norm and I believe eventually I will sleep as I used to. 

We are resilient creatures and our bodies and minds have a great deal of plasticity. We just have to take advantage of it and support it. Our use of Kratom and the effects it's had on us, can make us feel broken, but we're not, we're just a little bent out of shape but we can bend back. We can bend into whatever shape we want and need to be. It all just takes time and effort and not giving up hope.

I thought I'd type up a post here because I am new here, and to put it honestly, I am scared of quitting. I feel regretful for what I have done to myself, especially financially. I need to quit while I still have some semblance of a savings left. I started first around last summer, maybe longer, on powdered Malaysion Kratom. I'd parachute it and do it about 2x/3x a day. Idk how many grams it is, but it wasn't a ton. I eventually stopped that when my friend got me hooked on the OPMS kratom, those liquid shot demons. Man, I did not know it at that time, but i was in for a ride. Those suckers grabbed me by the balls, and I want off this ride.

Previously, my only addiction was adderall via my prescription. I quit that 3 months ago, and feel great. I feel healthier. The issue is that my kratom use (and therefore my money) was being spent increasingly in order to get through the tough ""withdrawals"" of quitting adderall. I know if I quit adderall, I can quit Kratom, but they are also different substances so Im not sure what I'm into. I don't get paid until Thursday, and rather than getting a liquid shot today, I am going to buy 1 bag of Malaysion Kratom with what little $ I have left in order to start the tapering process, and effectively fracture my depdence and habit of buying the expensive liquid shots.

Anyway, nice to meet all of you; if you wouldn't mind wishing me luck and sending me some of your energy, I'd really appreciate it. I'm scared for myself and my future and I Have no one to turn to about this.",26,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.44715947}"

I would like to share my story in hopes of feeling some type of freedom with finally getting it all out. I‚Äôm feeling like crap so please excuse any typos lol I‚Äôm 28 yrs old and I‚Äôve been taking Kratom since 2014 (so 5 freaking years!) It‚Äôs hard to really even admit that it‚Äôs been this long. I‚Äôve gotten up to 90grams a day and I‚Äôve absolutely hit rock bottom. I grew up in a pretty stressful household with parents fighting and just a lot of adult situations that I had to deal with at a pretty young age, but I did well in school, I cheered and tumbled from the time I could basically walk lol and was also involved in choir. I went to college and earned a bachelors degree. My work was very stressful and I recently resigned from my position. But for ppl on the outside looking in they would think I had a pretty decent life. Well they would be wrong! I‚Äôve always had anxiety and depression issues but I kept them hidden as much as I could. From an early age I learned I had to be the strong one since my mom was constantly having meltdowns and ‚Äúneeding‚Äù me. So on the inside I was never really at ease. UNTIL I had my first pain pill (I think it was a Percocet) it was given to my by a family member in the hopes of helping me with my extremely bad cramps during that time of the month. I was told to only take half before bed, which I did and about 20 mins later not only was the pain from my cramps gone but the pain from my childhood, the pain from my present and the anxiety and uncertainty of my future ALL GONE I loved the feeling and felt completely ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and at ease as I drifted off to sleep. Every month only during that time of the month I would get 3 tablets from the family member and that soon became the best week of the month. I looked forward to it now smh lol I had my wisdom teeth pulled shortly after and was prescribed tramadol and I‚Äôve never really been sober since which was 7 years ago. I was on a hunt for 2 years for tramadol. I went everywhere to get it. I complained of pains that were never really there to get it. I just couldn‚Äôt stop myself. I realized about a yr in that not only was this dependance but addiction. I researched online for a substance similar to an opiate that was legal and found kratom. To be honest when I first took it I didn‚Äôt like it very much but it kept the withdrawals away and kept me very numb so I continued to order it. Fast forward 5 yrs and my addiction has completely ruined my life. I literally have nothing because of the amount of money I‚Äôve spent on this substance to feed my addiction. I‚Äôve kept it all a secret for all of these years it feels good to finally ramble and just get it all out. I‚Äôm ending day 1 ct and this is the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever in life had to do but I know it is the only way out. The only was back to myself. I feel like I‚Äôm going to die I almost feel like I want to die but I‚Äôm going to try my hardest to make it through this night it‚Äôs been agony.

I said how scared I was to find out WHO I REALLY WAS, since I'd been stifling my authentic self for a damn decade. I was terrified to take the plunge, scared I'd be a ""dud"" of a person. 

When I first started talking pills, I did it mainly to turn myself into a talkative, proactive person. And wooooWEE, did that work. For a couple years. Then it just drug on and on and on. Fear. The terrible, all encompassing FEAR of quitting, being ""sober"". Would anyone even still like me? Would I like myself? Would I just continue not to live up to any potential, floating through life day by day, nothing changing or improving? 

I figured that if I started taking opiates/kratom to feel more awake/personable/energetic/happy, that if I stopped I'd be the opposite of all those things. 

Well it was quite a journey the first few weeks of cold turkey. Life was HARD. Some days everything was dull. Some days everything was in Technicolor. NOW though, 100 days sober... GUYS let me tell you: I wish I had made this leap YEARS ago. 

I still talk a mile a minute when I'm excited. 

I still LAUGH. 

I still enjoy my hobbies. 

I'm no longer tired every. damn. day. 

I CARE about people and relationships now. I CARE. I text my friends I haven't talked to in a couple weeks things like ""how are you?!"" I call my really annoying aunt lol. 

I no longer have to worry about being in a really low point at any given time of the day, just waiting for that peak of the high to get ANYTHING remotely meaningful done. 

I finally want to take care of myself. I just got done with my first week of an amazing new job. It's the first job I've ever had that actually utilizes my college degree. I feel so important. I finally don't feel like a piece of shit. I can finally begin to start respecting myself. No more HIDING. It's absolutely freeing in comparison to my life on opiates. 

Fuck oxycodone.  Fuck morphine. Fuck fentanyl. Fuck KRATOM especially though; what a sneaky fucking monster of a substance.

Please help...,"Here I am at it again... my last dose of Kratom was yesterday at 1pm; I took 3 OPMS Gold caps when I woke up yesterday, and 3 more at 1pm, that's it. Later that day I dissolved a 50mg naltrexone pill in a bottle of water and put it by my night stand.

This morning around 6 or 7am I started taking sips of it every so often for few hours until I started to feel like utter shit: shivers, skin burning, muscle and joint pain, you know the drill: typical (but accelerated?) WD symptoms. I still feel like shit now, it's been about 3 hours since the worse started, but I remember last time I did this I took 25mg pill all at once, and it was definitely worse then than now. Honestly the last time I took a full or half a 50mg naltrexone pill to do a rapid detox (on the same day I consumed kratom) it must have given me PTSD because I was terrified of taking the sips of water with it this morning.

So my question is: did I take enough naltrexone today to flush all the kratom out of me rapidly? Looking at how much water I drank I would say I ingested 5-7mg of it at most. Was this enough? Is my precipitated WD today not as bad because this time I waited almost 24 hours, or is it because I took less naltrexone?

I know I probably should just take a whole naltrexone pill later today, tonight, or tomorrow, but I'm really scared it will be brutal again. I'm hoping that the combination of waiting a day and taking dissolved naltrexone over few hour period kind of softened the blow while still being as effective.

I LOVE planning things and spent most of yesterday buying a planner for 2020 and getting stickers, etc to decorate each week. I've also been obsessed with skincare lately, since my dark circles are gone and my skin has cleared up, so I've been reading more about that and yesterday spent a few dollars at the drugstore upgrading my face wash, lotions, etc. 

There have been some pink cloud moments, a few ""high on life"" experiences, but mostly I'm just resting and getting some medical things sorted out that I've been slacking on for a year. I've also become obsessed with my credit score and reports, so I'm diligently working on cleaning that up, especially so I can get my own place by the end of the year. I've left quite a mess behind me the past year.

With my injuries came prescriptions and I became scared that I may loose control again . So I started using kratom to manage my pain . 

It‚Äôs been a little over a year now , and I am fully addicted to kratom . It tastes like shit , it‚Äôs expensive and honestly I wake up every morning with minor withdrawal symptoms. Worst of all , it has done major damage to my stomach , and is causing me to have bad times in the bathroom . Sorry I‚Äôm not trying to be gross .... 

I am on the fence about taking pills again just to not have to drink this shit everyday . And honestly the withdrawals I‚Äôm having from no kratom are just as bad as ones I used to have when I was abusing pills . 

I was in a reddit group r/opiatesrecovery and literally every thread some naive person or several would hype the benefits of kratom or suggest suboxone . Terrible advice , because kratom dependency absolutely sucks , it‚Äôs just a one off replacement , but people speak of it like the holy grail . 

Anyway I have been prescribed klonopin and am going to get a small amount of tianeptine , maybe one suboxone strip , and try to kick this . I know the risks of the above so please spare me the know-it-all danger warnings . 

Honestly it‚Äôs the only way I can deal and still perform at work , as an engineer , I need to be on point . Eating an oz of kratom a day just let‚Äôs me feel normal , but it‚Äôs destroying me . 

Benzos should help with the RLS and insomnia , tianeptine at small dosage should give me just enough to not have my entire body aching . Does anyone know what might help with the cold/hot flashes ?

I went from 8mg to 1 mg over about nine months, and it was all pretty easy and fast until I hit 2mg.  Then it was torture for weeks every time I reduced by 0.25.  I couldn‚Äôt stabilize below 1mg (bouncing back and forth between 0.5 and 1) so I just said fuck it and jumped from there.  

This isn‚Äôt my first rodeo.  I have previously kicked a two year sub habit going from 8mg to 0 in one month (lost insurance, no job, etc.). Without a doubt the worst experience of my entire life.  A full 90 days of sleepless hell and misery.  Would jump off a bridge before doing that again.

This time, I got a bunch of Kratom and klonopin, and clonodine prescriptions to help with the withdrawals, and it definitely did the trick.  I have all the other supplements people mention, I exercise every single day for at least half an hour, and I eat healthy food. I was able to continue working (time off not an option) productively, so long as I took my Kratom every 3 hours.  Started out needing massive doses, 6g five times a day. Needed the klonopin to sleep.  Still do, and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm now dependent on that after 50 days.

Now, about 50 days out, I‚Äôm down to 9-11 gpd  from my original 30 when first kicking the subs.  But I‚Äôm waking up four hours after I go to sleep. I usually go back to sleep for an hour or two, but it feels like I have hit a wall on dosage reduction.  

If I don‚Äôt take my 1.8 - 2g dose every ~3 hours, I go into withdrawal.  I wake up in the night in withdrawal.  I can get back to sleep, but it‚Äôs very restless. I‚Äôm wide awake before 5:00 am every day, and dose immediately on waking.

The longest I go between doses is usually 10-12 hours, 5 pm - 6pm through the night.  Since getting down to this level, I have difficulty spacing my doses out more because I can‚Äôt work effectively unless I am within 2.5 hours of my last dose. After work, I can suffer a bit without messing up my life. My work hours are from 7:00 am to 5pm, M-F.

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs still from the subs, or whether I‚Äôm now feeling Kratom withdrawal, or if my brain is just fried. 

Should I stay here for awhile longer to get farther out from the subs, or should I continue the slow taper?

2019-11-09 14:41:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/du0nfc/help_me_please/,Help me please.,"I think I may be dying. I don't have the frame of mind right now to make this post elegant, so I'm just going to give the run down quick and dirty.

I've been taking kratom for a year and a half to two years. I'm not sure of my dosage but i'd guess it's 60grams a day of leaf powder with warm water. Occasionally more than that, but rarely less. I need to quit immediately, but every time I try, I panic and give up. I've dealt with withdrawal before from opiates (suboxone, oxycodone, heroin) which were far worse than what this feels like, but the reason I keep failing is panic attacks. These panic attacks aren't happening because of kratom withdrawal, but rather because of the reason I need to quit. None of this has been confirmed but i'm usually very in tune with my body, so i'll list the symptoms and tell you what I think is happening.

I'm peeing a LOT, but barely have the urge to urinate unless I let it build up all day. I had a few days where my back was extremely itchy, but with no rash. Just incredibly itchy. I've had a fever on and off since this all started, and no energy. My lower back hurts and occasionally so does my groin. This entire time, every time I pee, it's always the exact same color. Nearly clear. Whether I drink water or not, and regardless of what I eat. And this all culminated in peeing blood a few days ago.

All of these symptoms are indicative of kidney failure/irreversible damage. I'm terrified. I'm having panic attacks every day, all day since this started. I tried to quit the day I peed blood, but ended up giving in after 24 hours when I was literally contemplating suicide to escape the fear of this situation. I know I need to quit but the mental symptoms from withdrawal + this panic every time I think about my kidneys and health is causing me to have breakdowns and go back to using. I cried for the first time in maybe 6 years yesterday. On top of all of this, I don't have health insurance (why I haven't gone to a doctor over it).

I need to quit, right now. I'm taking one last cup of kratom so I can go run errands/get supplies for this upcoming withdrawal. Anyone know what I can take to lessen the symptoms and calm myself? Ideally things that aren't rough on the kidneys/liver (no loperamide). I'm stuck in this situation where I know I absolutely cannot afford to give in right now, but kratom is the only thing making the knowledge of what may be going on with my body bearable. I want to go back to my childhood right now. I'm only 25 years old and I may be fucking dying. Any advice is welcome.

Also, one last question :I have two weeks off work right now, I could probably get a third. Is that long enough to get through the withdrawal? I've never fully went through it with kratom, and i'm hoping to god it wont be like suboxone, where it just got continually worse for two weeks and took a month for the physical symptoms to go away. Also, the 24 hour period I went through, the physical symptoms didn't seem so bad. Hopefully that's a good sign, but I doubt it.  


  
(Update) Comments were mostly correct. I had a particularly bad kidney & bladder infection. I got antibiotics for it and am feeling a little better. My concern now is that I've tried to quit 3 times and haven't succeeded. I've hopped off 8mg daily suboxone for 2+ years cold turkey in the past and somehow got through it. Somehow this feels worse. I gave up yesterday at around 30 hours when it felt like I literally could not exist in that state any longer. I didn't take anything to help besides smoking weed. I was flailing violently and it got to the point that my girlfriend, despite knowing what I was going to go through and being very optimistic, told me flat out that If I wanted to give up, I could, and she wouldn't blame me. Somehow that made it even worse. I don't want to be stuck on this shit for the rest of my life, but I have no idea how i'll ever be able to withstand that for multiple days. It was unbearable for 10 seconds let alone a week. It honestly felt comparably bad to precipitated withdrawal from heroin. I don't know what I should do. This was my one shot, I used my vacation time from work to try to achieve this and i'm not going to get another chance to quit for over a year. I feel absolutely worthless. I'm looking into trying to finance medically induced withdrawal where they make you unconscious through the worst of it. It's around 15,000 dollars and i'm not a wealthy person. I don't even have the credit to take a loan for it. I feel like it's all I can do at this point. It especially sucks because I was getting ready to buy/build my dream car. That probably wont be happening now.  


Just in case someone reads this and it deters them from using kratom : I had an easier time quitting hard opiates with a longer duration of use, and insane amounts (300mg+ oxycodone a day). I know that wont be the case for everyone but I feel ruined. This shit isn't worth it, and you should avoid it. I'd trade anything to feel normal without kratom, but the withdrawal feels insurmountable.",7,{'infect': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.85562164}"

I am NOT suggesting moving from one addiction to another (yes weed can become an addiction) but I am suggesting that for some, maybe a lot of people, marijuana can greatly help alleviate some pretty rough withdrawal symptoms. As a disclaimer, I will say that when I used to take a lot of kratom and then later smoke, it would turn me into the dumbest, stupidest fucking most idiotic retarded zombie dumbass vegetable fucking loser. It amplified the negatives of kratom comedowns x10. BUT marijuana alone is different, clearly.....

For 1, it can help tremendously with sleep. Getting high before bedtime helps millions and millions of people sleep, improve their sleep, stay asleep etc. I‚Äôm not saying it will completely fix this part of serious kratom withdrawal, but it could really help... 

It can also help with eating. I notice many people saying they have lost appetite while coming off the shit. Well I‚Äôll be god damned if weed won‚Äôt fix that right up! 

It can also just help you think more creatively about your current situation, help with meditation, help make you laugh and feel okay. This is was weed does for people. I am NOT suggesting to get stoned all day 24/7 and become a weed zombie bc that would just be switching from one thing to the next. However, for some people that method would actually work. For most people I‚Äôm suggesting starting small. If you are not a marijuana smoker and that is due to your own personal hang ups or family situation (kids, husband, wife, whatever) I say you look into for yourself and make a grown up educated decision on this. It‚Äôs the 21st century people if marijuana is used correctly it‚Äôs fucking life changing for some people. For someone sitting there in the dark shithole of kratom withdrawal, this could be helpful. Personally, my weed use soured while I was on kratom for the reason I listed in the first paragraph. Now I have reserved my smoking for nighttime after a long, hard, successful day of taking steps in the right direction. It is a reward for me, helps me relax and enjoy an evening and prepare myself for the next day with a good meal and good sleep. Since im not smoking while loaded on K anymore, I am only reaping the benefits of good ol Mary Jane.

I know it's a pain in the ass. I know getting into it doesn't feel good, and once you are into it, it doesn't give any kind of relief, buzz or high that could ever compare to Kratom. But no matter what, the fact of the matter is: if you want to kick Kratom for good, you need to make some \*big\* changes. Lifestyle changes are going to be a huge part of a successful journey past Kratom.

I've written in the past about how supplements don't do anything for me. And I know from the replies to that post and messages I've received that the same is true for many people quitting Kratom. Even for the people that do get relief and benefit from supplements, the fact remains that at some point, lifestyle changes \*will\* need to come into play. If you keep doing all the same things you were doing on Kratom, the temptation to do Kratom will be tough to avoid. On top of all that, there are very real reasons to make the lifestyle changes I talk about below. They could really help with both the physical and mental symptoms of withdrawal. 

I personally believe that most important change you can make during your quit is to exercise. No matter what, you need to move, to work with your body. You don't need to do a specific prescribed routine. But you need to move. You need to get your heartrate up, and you need to sweat... for at least 30 minutes, at least 3 times a week. It's going to get a little uncomfortable. That's okay. Some of you will be sensitive to the endorphins released during and after exercise, and it'll actually provide some relief from the lack of Kratom. Some of you are like me and will just feel tired and disoriented and shitty... and that's just physically. Mentally, you might be miserable... at first. But when you start to see the results of challenging yourself, you will feel something on a mental and emotional level and it \*will\* be profound, I assure you. On the major plus side, the exercise will tire you out, which will help with sleep. It may very well also get your body producing hormones the way it's supposed to again. It'll help regulate your appetite. Exercise is awesome. Like I said, doesn't need to be any particular thing. Walk, if that's all your up to (but at a degree that gets your heartrate up). Do yoga. Lift weights. Run. Swim. (Fuck, if you're a gamer, the new Ring Adventure for Fit works my powerlifting, half-marathon running ass \*out\*.) And hey, if you already exercised during your use, and are still exercising during your quit: set new goals, do stuff you don't normally do (if you're a lifter, try yoga)

The next thing that I think is really important:  meditation/breathing/stillness/mindfulness. For some, this may actually be more of a challenge than the exercise. It is for me. Finding time and a comfortable place to be still is tough, and once you do it... it's fucking boring, you guys. I'm not gonna sugar coat any of this. Sitting there, doing nothing, kinda sucks. Breathing work like the Wim Hof method is a good addition and/or alternative because you have to put your mind into it a little more. Mindfulness work is also great, and can have incredible outcomes in terms of quitting substances. A great book to check out on this subject (reasonably non-religious/non-denominational) is Wherever You Go There You Are by Jon Kabat-Zinn. The book Secular Meditation by Rick Heller is also good.

This next one is also totally necessary for your recovery, but is often neglected: get your thoughts out of your head. The best thing is obviously to work with a licensed mental health professional. A psychiatrist can prescribe medication, which realistically, many of us could use. But they're tough to get appointments with for many. Therapists and councilors, even chaplains depending on your religious (or non-religious! there \*are\* humanist and atheist chaplains) background are much easier to come by and are all fantastic to talk to. The idea here isn't that they're going to solve all your problems. Having a professional who is detached from your personal life to speak to is a really good thing. If you can't afford it, don't have the time, or just can't bring yourself to do it, journal. Write your thoughts down. Doesn't need to be coherent, you can go full stream-of-consciousness. Doesn't need to be permanent tear the pages up when you're done (though, I recommend you keep them and check them out weeks, months, years from now. You'll be surprised). Just write until all the crazy stuff the Kratom withdrawal makes you think is out of your head.

Develop and/or revisit interests, hobbies, diversions, creative outlets, passions, etc. \*Do\* stuff!. Whatever you're interested in, just get into it. This might be active stuff, like writing, drawing, painting, making music, playing sports, knitting, martial arts. Just anything you can get into doing. On the other end, do passive stuff like read, watch movies, TV, play video games, listen to music or podcasts. At first, all this stuff is just to pass the time, keep your mind off the fact that you're not doing Kratom, but the fact of the matter is you \*will\* start to get into this stuff.

There are a lot of other lifestyle changes you could and should make. \*Eat better!\* For the love of god, eat more vegetables and consume less sugar! Re-arrange your living space. Connect with old friends (probably more important but much tougher: cut out toxic people). Find new places to hang out. Maybe travel if you can (even if it's just like day trips around where you live). Change up your daily routine (wake up a little earlier take some extra time for you). 

Like I said, doing all this stuff isn't easy. In fact it's very possible that a lot, if not all, of it will absolutely suck. Even the stuff that is supposed to chemically do stuff for you (like food and exercise) probably isn't going to feel anywhere close to as good as you remember Kratom feeling. It's still so important to make these changes, and while you might not feel anything strong in the moment, the effect of all this stuff over time will be incalculable. When you're a month into your quit, exercising, meditating, and doing the things you love every day, you won't believe how much better you feel.

Quitting Kratom is hard and it sucks. Kratom changed your life. It made everything different and probably worse. Getting Kratom out of your life will require fixing it again. And that's okay. Change is good. You can do it. I believe in you.",52,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46130562}"

BTW I really appreciate all the helpful words of wisdom, advice, and positivity that people post here, it has helped me immensely. This may be way too long for anyone to read, but here it is-

**HOW I STARTED** 

Always dealt with some level of depression, and pretty a heavy level of social anxiety. I‚Äôm a fairly big introvert, and don‚Äôt like most social situations. When I was introduced to Kratom I LOVED it immediately. Made me feel happy, energetic, and I did not fear social situations when I took it. Plus the stuff was cheap and easily accessible- perfect.  I actually thought it was a completely healthy supplement at first but I did some research, and realized that there was some potential for tolerance build up and addiction, but most people online just praise it. I wasn‚Äôt too fearful of side effects, because there are potential side effects for almost everything, even Advil. I had never really dealt with addiction in my life before, except smoking a lot of weed when I was a teenager, and sometimes drinking a bit too much/often. Still I figured out that I should be aware of tolerance buildup, and only use it 2-3 times per week. 

2 times a week didn‚Äôt last very long, and most of the first year I decided to use it 3 times a week. I looked forward to these days so much. It started to occur to me that since I was taking days off, it didn‚Äôt matter how much I would take on the days-on as long as I still took 4 days off. Probably after about 1 year I decided taking it 4 days on and 3 days off wasn‚Äôt a big difference so I went up to 4 days a week. After a while I started to realize that I really hated my days off, and started to schedule my life around these days off. (I tried to schedule my days off to be days where I had nothing too important to do at work or socially).  This only got worse, I started taking more and more on my Kratom ON days and my Kratom OFF days were becoming hell. I believe around year three I decided I would take it 5 days during the work week and take weekends off.   Now my work week was ok, but my weekends were shit, my gf wanted to do stuff on the weekend, and I never wanted to do much. Eventually I went to 6 days a week. I held at 6 days a week for a long time, and just endured 1 day per week of withdrawals, depression and absolutely no motivation. It wasn‚Äôt until somewhere around year 4 that I said f‚Äô it, I‚Äôm just going to take this stuff every day. I tried to not overdo it each day, but eventually that went out the window too, and I started taking it all day, every day, morning to night. I stopped eating as much and barely even drank anymore because I didn‚Äôt want anything messing with my high. On year 5 I was taking somewhere between 15 ‚Äì 20 teaspoons a day, I guess about 75g. I brought it with me everywhere and could barely go more than an hour without it. Someone also gave me an Adderall, which I tried for the first time a few months ago, it gave me an energy boost, and since I don‚Äôt get the same energy boost I used to from Kratom, I went to the doctor and got myself a prescription for that too. In the past 6 months of year 5 I started to lose weight rapidly, I was always a pretty thin/fit guy and was around 170lbs my whole adult life, and I dropped to 150lbs. This is when my family got very concerned. They all started urging me to quit, and I was resistant, but something happened with my work, and an unexpected slow period came up, so I said fine, I can take a week off work now and I‚Äôll try quitting. 

**QUITTING**

My plan was to attempt to get from 15 ‚Äì 20 teaspoons per day to 0 with my week off and then get back to work. I tracked every dose with a tally app on my iphone.

Day 1  10 teaspoons

Day 2  6 teaspoons

Day 3  4 teaspoons 

Day 4  3 teaspoons

Day 5  2 teaspoons 

Day 6  1 teaspoon (to sleep)

Day 7  1 teaspoon (to sleep)

Day 8  1 teaspoon (to sleep)

Day 9  0 teaspoons

This was probably the worst week of my life. I was crying (which I never do), shaking, severe depression, etc. The week felt like months. But as bad as it was I was pretty impressed with myself that I got down to 0.

I bought every vitamin/supplement that I researched about on the internet. Magnesium, Ashgawanda, Vitamin B, CBD Oil, Multivitamins, Passion flower, Turmeric. I don‚Äôt know how much any of this stuff helped, but I took it all every day. I also took a couple Epsom Salt baths.

The ONLY moments that I did not feel absolutely horrible was for an hour or so after I worked out at the gym and got some natural endorphins released from my workout. So besides basically locking myself in my room all day I found the strength to drive to the gym each day ‚Äì 6 days a week. 

On day 9 I am taking no Kratom but I still have no ability to sleep at night. I talk to a family member about it and he gives me a whole bunch of clonazepam and THC oil. I take 2 pills a night and some THC oil and I‚Äôm able to sleep. 

**Week 2** ‚Äì Back at work. No Kratom.

Luckily things were still pretty slow at work, and this was a week that I was able to work from home. The super intense WDs are gone, but I still feel like shit, weak, unenergetic, don‚Äôt really want to talk to anyone. I only do the work that I absolutely have to get done, and ignore any work that could be put off. I‚Äôm wondering if I quit too quickly, and if I‚Äôm going to be able to take this much longer. By the end of week 2, it feels like it has been months, and I feel like it‚Äôs going to take years to feel normal again. I speak to a family member and they remind me it‚Äôs only been 14 days, and I have to keep with it. The weekend comes, and I relax all weekend, spend a little time with close family and I start to feel a bit more at peace.

**Week 3** 

On Monday of week 3, I am back at work and feeling a bit better. I have hope now that there may be an end to this. I‚Äôm definitely not 100% but I push myself through work as best as I can, and think I‚Äôm feeling slightly better every day. 

**Week 4** ‚Äì Business Trip

I have to go on a trip by myself, all the way to Asia, where I have to exhibit at a trade show and talk to literally hundreds of people, I will be working all day long and at business dinners all night. I make the decision to bring some kratom with me just in case I need it. I had several flight delays/cancelations, so I was stressed and exhausted immediately. On day 1 of the trade show, after about a 25 hour flight and 1 hour of sleep, I make it about 2 hours in before I feel like my head is going to explode or I‚Äôm just going to go back to the airport and go back home. I take a kratom. Since my tolerance had gone way down the high from the kratom lasted most of the day. I felt like I was in heaven for a few hours. With barely being able to sleep or exercise on this trip I took 1 kratom every day (4 days), plus one night that had a big event to go to. When I get home, after more plane delays, another 25+ hour flight, I feel like absolute shit and take another one on Sunday before I have to go back to work. 

**Week 5** ‚Äì Back home

Monday morning comes and I am back at work. I‚Äôve now taken a kratom dose the last 5 days, and this morning I am feeling HEAVY WDs again. I am panicked, I feel like I‚Äôm back at week 1, and I cannot start this process from the beginning again. I am moments away from saying fuck it, I‚Äôm going to start taking at least 1 a day again. I try to call a close friend who knows I‚Äôm quitting to tell him what I am going through and get him to talk me down but I can‚Äôt get in touch with him. All I can think about is taking another kratom. But I just barely find the strength inside me to make it through the day without it, if I had any kind of business meeting or social event to do this day I probably would have taken one.

Tuesday morning ‚Äì I feel ok. Thank God my relapse only gave me 1 day of WDs. Thank God I didn‚Äôt take any on Monday. 

I actually do some good work this week, but I‚Äôm still not at 100% at my job. I‚Äôm still pretty unenergetic, and not seeking out any social situations, but not terrified of them either. 

**Today** \- Day 33 

I have no feelings of withdrawals. But my energy is still pretty low, twice someone asked me if I was ok or if I was tired when they talked to me. Also I hung out with my ex and she said my confidence seemed low and I was very negative. I don‚Äôt mind talking to close friends or family members but am still not too anxious to socialize more than that. There are 2 things that may also be causing my low energy, the clonazepam and THC oil that I‚Äôm taking every night, although I went from 2 pills to 1. I am going to try to stop taking these this weekend. Also I have continued to go to the gym and do intense workouts 6 days a week to try to get an endorphin rush. I‚Äôm probably overworking myself in the gym. Besides that, it‚Äôs hard to tell how close to normal I am. It‚Äôs been 5 years on Kratom, and I don‚Äôt really remember what normal feels like. I had social anxiety before and maybe I already am mostly back to normal, and just need to realize/re-learn I have to fight through my social anxiety.  I‚Äôm single, and have been using dating apps for the last year, and I haven‚Äôt contacted or responded to a single girl on there since I started quitting, and I still don‚Äôt feel like it. I even completely ignored a couple really attractive girls that contacted me.  I guess I‚Äôll see as the weeks continue to go on, how I feel. If I continue to shut myself off from the world then the desire to start using Kratom again could come back, although now I‚Äôm fully aware of how slippery of a slope it is, and how horrible it is to quit, so that would be a very big decision. I know in the past, before kratom, I resorted to drinking a lot of alcohol when I went out, and I don‚Äôt really want to go back to that either. There is also the question of the Adderall, this along with a lot of coffee is really helping me each day at work. But now I need to decide if I should quit this too.  

The great news is that I was able to get off the stuff. And if anyone read this whole thing and is thinking of quitting, if you were taking less than 75g every day, for less than 5 years it should be even easier for you.

I have been through turmoil and back in my life, many things have happened from a young age where I found solace in mind altering substances. Everything used to be ‚Äúfun‚Äù or perhaps finding something within myself with each use. Then devastating things happen, wrong drugs for the wrong times, then heroin.

I am 5 years clean this year from heroin. I packed up, I had an opportunity to live with my brother across the country and help develop his business. I was broken then, I did not know who I was or why I was there, just to finally have the opportunity to focus on my recovery and myself for the first time in my life. Face my horrendous previous life obstacles head on. I turned to alcohol and from my upbringing of a completely functional alcoholic father (until a point of no return-and I am talking VERY wealthy functional to the point of nothing), it seemed my addiction personality ran too apparent with my brain. I knew I was a goner. Until I found Kratom. Kratom helped me get up in the morning, eager to do things, excited about life without the dreadfulness of any other drug I had ever experienced. It made what were once gruesome daily tasks into exciting want-to-be-done things. It made me awesome! I loved that. That was 2.5 years ago, and now... now I am reliant. My addictive brain has taken this completely into a downward spiral into something I had 100% complete control over into something close of resemblance to heroin in what now seems overnight. No one I live with (brother, sister in law, boyfriend of almost 3 years), has no idea of this battle. I have hid it extremely well, and am trying to conquer this on my own to spare my embarrassment of being addicted to something so fucking stupid in my brain. Especially given my past of opioid addiction. So many times I want to scream and say ‚ÄúHELP!‚Äù But I know it will never be that. I am looking to this sub for guidance to help me through.

Things were rough for the first 25 days or so, but has since steadily improved. Depression, anxiety, and lethargy were the worst parts of the withdrawl and I was in a pretty dark place for a bit. I literally could not feel enjoyment from anything... the past felt unbearable, the present was complete shit, and the future seemed bleak. It seemed to last forever. I started getting those dark thoughts ""is this how bad reality is?"", but I perservered through and by day 28 I was beginning to feel like myself again.

I had been high basically for two years. I forgot that my memory could be so good. I forgot the drive, motivation, and charisma that I once had.

The last month since the upswing began has been a period of getting to know myself all over again. I feel strong, capable, and ready to contend with all of the life challenges that I would shrink away from before during this dark period.

My advice to those going through withdrawls right now comes in three parts:

1) perservere no matter how hard it seems, the light at the end of the tunnel is far brighter than you remember

2) after the first week, you have to practice having fun again. Literally. Go do sober things that you used to do for fun. It won't be enjoyable at first- trust me. You have to literally retrain your brain to produce endorphins from natural means. Fake it until you make it. This will expedite your recovery I promise.

3) maintain complete sobriety. Don't even rely on alcohol, phenibut, weed, or anything. You not only need to detox from kratom, but also literally relearn how to take pleasure in things in complete sobriety-- like when you were a kid. Only when you relearn this will you truly recover and be the best & happiest version of yourself.",13,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.50624996}"

We just never take the time to stop and look.  I know meditation is hard for lots of people, but if we can even just stop and sit and close our eyes and look inside our hearts, we will see that we were never truly disconnected from Source. IT lives inside that empty place.  I know I have been searching my whole life for something, anything to fill that void.

 So far today I haven't had any issues other than some mild withdrawal episodes that come and go, but I previously couldn't go a few hours without taking a shot so there must be something to that. That and this is the first time I'm fucking done mentally and physically with this shit.

I took the advice from someone here and downloaded a few apps to help me, one is called life diary it's a journal and I keep track of everything. 


The second is called quit kratom and you can input all of your info, it gives you stats what to expect countdowns etc. These two apps I constantly see on my phone and it really helps to check and add what you need. 


I have enough powder to transition, then I'm going to kick it (hopefully in a weeks time). I know that sounds soon, but my mental game is strong this time and I've dealt with the worst opioid withdrawals from super long and high doses of hydrocodone and tramadol, which the last time I i did I found kratom to help with and it slowly spiraled from there.


I have a ton of physical issues but I'd rather deal with them while feeling like myself, instead of robbing everyone I know of who I really am because I'd rather be high.


Luckily the powder doesn't do that for me like the shots, so my head isn't clouded. Every time I think of a reason that sounds like a good idea I shut it down. 


I just want to thank everyone in this sub, I feel like I have a community that understands and supports me and without reading all of your wonderful posts, I don't know if I could have the confidence in myself to do it. 


Wish me Luck, you can do it too.

I didn‚Äôt understand what was happening but during that seventh day I must‚Äôve built a tolerance and went into unwilling withdrawal that lead to a panic attack which made me quit kratom out right that day. I did not find out I had been taking phenibut until around day 10 of being completely off kratom so it must have exacerbated my symptoms those first few days or maybe the first week in totality which it‚Äôs insane I went through that and thought that much anxiety was normal for withdrawal; practically laying and sleeping on the floor for 3.5 days straight.

I recently discovered amazing benefits when I began dosing kratom sublingualy. I ended up needing way less to curb withdrawls (around half a gram placed under the tounge). I was able to taper down from 16 grams a day all the way down to nothing within the span of 2 weeks. Once you start dosing sublingual you'll find the urge to take monster doses will soon completely disappear. And you'll be off the stuff before you know it. It is my first day completely clean in close to a year and I feel amazing. The taste alone was enough to help keep me from turning back to using kratom as a crutch to deal with everyday life.

Before that I had spent almost a month doing a few days without and using again, then repeating the cycle. I feel like each time I took more kratom, it became less effective and made the withdrawals worse. I goofed up yesterday and took a small dose, but I am back to feeling the way I was before. The reason I am posting is because I can't find anything online about what I'm going through and I'm wondering if anyone has had a similar experience. I have quit opiates, heroin, and kratom before, and each time I always feel like I bounce back in a week or two. I have had sustained periods of sobriety, 2 years being the longest, so I know I am capable of achieving this goal. This time is different however. It has been almost 3 weeks of feeling horrible. I wouldn't say I'm necessarily suffering, but my stomach hurts all the time, I always feel fatigued, my skin crawls, it's hard to ever get comfortable, especially late in the evening, it's incredibly hard to focus, and I am having debilitating social anxiety. I have a job serving in a restaurant, and I've always found it very easy to talk to my tables and do my job. Now I'm struggling just going into a gas station and conversing with the cashier without wanting to jump out of my skin. This is humiliating and demoralizing. I had to take a leave of absence from work because of this. A month ago I was getting in really good shape and I haven't been able to workout since because of the stomach pain. At this point I have to sit down seriously and make a decision about where to go from here because I can't continue not working or trying to progress in life. Has anyone ever experienced this kind of drawn out withdrawal or have I seriously damaged my body from years of abuse? I should also add that I don't have insurance so I haven't talked to a doctor yet.

Since then I've used it everyday but 4 days early on.  The first kind was the V brand that had crystals in it and I could tell it was funky.  From then on out I would take multiple doses a day sometimes with an extract added, sometimes not.  I used to consider 4.5g with extract a low dose. Now I'm down to 1.5g doses spread thru the day sometimes with extract added.  Every time I've made dose lowering changed it didn't really affect me.  I bought a scale to be precise cus I used to dump piles.  I use it for the stimulant-type effects.  I prefer low doses.  It doesn't affect my sex drive at all and if anything I'm more on the ball at work.  I also quit opiates cold turkey 2 different times and there was a 15 month gap between quitting narcotics and starting kratom.  Since I take low doses spread thru the day and I plan to cut down to 1g per dose then jump would the withdrawal be more like abstaining from uppers?

That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so hard to quit.,"For me the hardest thing to quit is the ability at which I perform at work while on K. It‚Äôs like Adderall for me but better. There‚Äôs no crash or come down. I did several experiments what I would do weeks on and weeks off and I work in a job where I can directly chart my performance and while taking it I did so much better on every single metric. The cost is an absolute obliteration of my sex drive and that directly impacts the way I interact with my wife. However while I am on K I drink much less, I‚Äôm happier, honestly pretty much everything is better. But knowing that I am living a life addicted to this green sludge will never work for me. I refuse to have a master, especially a fucking plant for a master. I‚Äôm trying to look at the way K made me be able to work as a learning lesson. Now my brain knows how to work in that way because I have experienced it, so hopefully I can learn how to feel that way without the plant and can utilize it naturally. Fingers crossed. I just have a really strong career and a lot on the line because I have a wife that I need to take care of and we‚Äôre hoping to have kids soon. A little insight into my life here, I‚Äôm in my mid-20s and have a six-figure career but if things don‚Äôt stay going perfectly that could all fall apart at any minute. I‚Äôm really scared to let go of the thing that‚Äôs making me so good at my job but I know I have to. I know it sounds silly to say the drug makes me better at work but I‚Äôve done the experiments and it really does. I‚Äôm hoping that I have taught my brain how to work like I am on K without actually being on it. It‚Äôs a sales based position so the social lubrication that K brings is unbelievable. I just need to learn how to be like that without the K. I refuse to let that sludge be my master.

This has been the best decision I've ever made I think. I never thought I would get off kratom. Since I quit, I decided to go back to school, I'm making all A's and I started a new band which has gotten pretty popular in my town. It's weird all the kinds of new stuff you go after when you stop numbing yourself constantly. I think people are finally starting to connect with my music since it's coming from my soul. I feel braggy right now but I figured a positive post couldn't hurt. 

Any tips from long term quitters about how to stay vigilant would be much appreciated. I'm not going to lie, I do have cravings, but I just try to ride it out. Those thoughts of just wanting to curl up in a blanket take some kratom and play battlefield are pretty intrusive sometimes. But it leads to resentment. Resentment at why am I not successful? Why am I broke? Why am I depressed? 

I have reintroduced alcohol only on weekends. Idk how I feel about this but I'm gonna stay vigilant. Being completely sober I just feel so left out sometimes. I don't think I really like alcohol enough for it to become a problem like kratom was. It just feels dirty. 

I hope you all are doing well, and just know it really is worth it! I'm starting to get to the point where I go all day without even thinking about it. Even if you slip up, keep trying.

Thanks for listening.

Edit to add: to elaborate on my frustrations with the Kratom sub or I suppose the Kratom community: When you start a new pharmaceutical you are told potential side effects, and if hair loss is one of them, you know to look out for it. If you realize you‚Äôre shedding more hair than usual after starting a new medication that lists hair loss as a side effect, you can pretty quickly discern the cause and then decide to stop the medication. Without the knowledge that Kratom could potentially cause hair loss, and basically an army of Kratom users denying its possibility, I spent MONTHS telling myself it must be something else. Sure, I could find a handful of comments saying it does cause hair loss, but those were overpowered by dozens and dozens of counter claims to those comments.

I‚Äôve been abusing some sort of drug my entire life.  Weed in high school, Aderall/Ritalin in college, Kratom more recently.  Aside from Kratom, I‚Äôve never been an every day user of these drugs.  Typically, I would take them to enhance activities (i.e. video games).  I‚Äôve since quit everything else, aside from Kratom.

I guess my question is, how do I learn to enjoy these activities without being altered in some way.  Video games and the like are just so dull without the added euphoria from Kratom now.  Is my brain broken?  Will I ever get to enjoy these things sober again?

After so many failed attempts I was ready to do something different but I had no idea what it was - I just knew putting anything else in my body was NOT the solution. 

During withdrawals the most uncomfortable thing for me always was/is RLS and general restlessness. What would usually happen as the evening came -  I would become really tired, felt like I was going to sleep for 10 hours and finally ""get that full night rest"" but of course I would wake up at 12am, 1am somewhere in that time frame and then fight the restlessness throughout the night only to wake up feeling exactly as expected, run over by a fucking truck.

Somewhere in my overall anger at the situation I thought - what if I just stop fighting this? Looking for a way out/shortcut? What would that look like? 

**Then it happened** \- I woke up at 1230am after only about an hour or 2 of half sleep and said you know what? ""Fuck it - I'm getting up, THANK YOU for giving me potentially 7 hours of uninterrupted time for myself.""

That night changed my life - every night after I woke up at whatever time it was and took the time for MYSELF. 

To this day I wake up between 4-5am and take that time for ME. I use this for reflection, interests and gym. The rest of the day is so much easier to dedicate to family since you have already gotten your stuff done. Business wise you aren't thinking about other stuff you need to do and mentally it feels good to know you got your shit done while your ""competition"" was snoozing away. 

I didn't do this for any other reason than to just ""be a dog"", in a way it felt like I was taking the pain and spitefully giving it back to my addiction. Mentally whether I knew it or not, I was putting myself first. Something I had never done.",43,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.61763895}"

What I have done to plan for my taper is - I've purchased a 1/2 kilo and split it into 4 jars. The first jar I am doing 3 scoops (my normal dose) then the next 2 jars i am doing 2 scoops. My last jar I am doing one scoop and I plan to go from my regular 3 doses to 2 and then 1 - so wish me luck.

Wondering if anyone can suggest over how many weeks/months I should plan for this taper. I began by starting with a total of 11g in 3 doses at 8, 2, and 6. Days One and Two have been cringey but I am still here. My thought was to continue that for a week (or two?) and then go down by a half-gram. Thoughts?

I do not want to push it so much that I am miserable and give up, like I did with my CT attempts. But I do not want to prolong the process unnecessarily and am aware that my mind will tell me a lot of crap.

Also, was the drop from 30 to 11 too much initially? Will that hit me? (Or, is that my addict brain wanting me to add more and go slower?)

Thanks for any experience and advice/suggestions anyone has to offer. I just dropped one of my kids at a sleepover and cried the whole way home; I am so afraid I will fuck this up again and have no money for their Christmas presents.

After two years of 30-40gpd, I was actually able to quit successfully for over five months. Lately (last few months) I've ""quit"" over and over, but always relapsed either a few days later or two weeks being the longest.

I've realized what was different and why my quits do not stick like the first time.

First of all, I'm not taking it seriously enough, in my mind since I've quit multiple times in the past, it shouldn't be too hard to do it again. (Very far from the truth).
Secondly, I don't have a plan and I'm not mentally ready. Not to say that it's a good idea to keep using and waiting for some miracle to happen, but trying to quit without getting yourself ready seems to be a recipe for failure.

Here is what I'm going to do differently this time...

Make sure I have at least a week of quiet time to deal with the withdrawal. Not like last time, where I decided to ""quit"" five days before an important business trip. I was already stressed out and trying to deal with WD symptoms during that time was a really bad idea.
Start exercising regularly and build a habit of doing something physical every day.
Start eating healthy, for me this might be the key difference... Lots of veggies and fruits, no sugar, little to no bread or pasta. Limited amounts of meat and fish per week, almost no dairy. 
Meditation. I used to meditate daily, but have lost the habit recently. It's not easy to notice any significant improvement, when you start doing it. But you definitely notice when you stop.

Your mind and body need to be in the right place, it will make withdrawals easier to deal with and hopefully shorten the duration of the nasty symptoms.

Last, but not least do some sort of a taper. I'm not very good at sticking to long tapers, but stopping abruptly (like when you simply run out) is going to be very difficult. If you are planning to CT you can still take a few days to reduce the dosage so there's less shock on your system.

Well, good luck everyone. I'm determined to quit again and for good. But I'm going to be ready for what's coming my way and take it seriously. I want this nasty sludge out of my life once and for all.",21,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5136484}"

I‚Äôve noticed that I‚Äôve shaved crazy fucking weight with these things I take, I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs the kratom because adderall in the past never made me this skinny, and phenibut is similar to GHB in a way which can pack on solid mass from what I hear. My boxes slip and I wear a belt to the beginning loop. The scale says 129... I‚Äôm like WTF. And I can slam fucking 3,500 calories like nothing.

Adderall I can combat with tyrosine or dl phenalaine 
For dopamine reuptake. Phenibut I‚Äôve tapered painlessly with a scale...oh and I dip too, how the fuck can I stop that shit? I went to that after getting carried away with the salt nicotine phase... disgusting...

‚Ä¢ Scared and not confident about the future  


My mind and body are so slow. I feel like a sloth. This is probably the most notable thing I‚Äôm going through. My body is stiff and achy and my mind is having a difficult time firing off actions. I will stare at something and think about doing something and nothing happens. I would describe it as like being on a mild version of Xanax but with unease and angst.

It's so crazy to think I got through 10 days of harsh withdrawals and in the third week this is where I'm at lol. I have no desire to ever use Kratom again even when I'm miserable like this. 

Even though I don't have the energy or drive to do much more than lay horizontal today, I am positive. I just wanted to share with community and maybe get some encouraging words. 

I was hoping this coming work week would be coming around a corner but by going off of other reading people's experiences I'm probably going to have to experience this for at least another week or two right? 

Days 11-18 I was like on this cloud of Zen with amazing warm and compassionate positive energy. I felt like my true Self (unhindered by endless thoughts about dealing with side effects and just feeling calm, confident and grateful in the present moment). 

I can see myself getting frustrated if I don't experience that again in the next 1-3 weeks.

I'm suppose to be at 11 gpd but on Friday 10/31 I missed a 2 gram dose. I didn't realize it till it was time for my last dose around 1:00 PM. I could have added it to my last dose. That would have made it a 5 gram dose and I didn't want to take that much. So I skipped it. Only had 9 for the day. Felt fine on Saturday and kept the morning doses down for another 9 gram day. In the afternoon around 2 PM, I woke from a short nap with my left hand twitching and left arm wanting to jump. I just sat there and let nature play out. RLS started spreading amazingly quickly. That's when I noticed the sharp, stabbing stomach pains. In minutes my arm started reaching out for invisible butterflies only it could see (I guess.)

I got up and took (late) my last 2 gram dose. That put me at 9 for the day again. Obviously, the acutes vanished and I was back to normal.

Today, 11/3, I had stomach pains from the get go. Got sharp around 9:00 AM. They come in brief waves now but continue to subside. Still aiming for a 9 gpd. 

The post is meant to illustrate how it takes days for a lower gpd to set in. I've had very little trouble tapering, but I usually aim for at least 7 days between drops and ONLY 1 gram at a time. I hope this is helpful for someone.

Fear is getting to me.,"So I originally posted here last week.  I made it a week.  The crawling anxiety finally made me cave.  It used to be that I could take a few days off no problem.  I was getting my kratom online, but since I had ""quit"" I ended up picking some up at a smoke shop.  It was relatively cheap, and I didn't expect much but it was actually really potent.  Surprisingly and suspiciously potent.  So I tried to quit again and THIS time instead of the normal acutes depression etc. I got absolutely crippling anxiety.  I mean walking around the house all night thinking I was going to end up hospitalized anxiety.  But I quit again.  Then, my psych Dr. (Who does not know I'm using kratom), informed me she would no longer be able to write prescriptions as she won't be in business anymore.  I get klonopin from her and I have for the last 15 years.  Always a small dose, and I started before I knew it was addictive.  My Dr. left that part out.  Now as soon as I find out I'm going to be quitting kratom, and I'll potentially be cut off from an anti-anxiety medication that has helped me to live a normal life for 15 years, I caved again.  The anxiety is only getting worse.  I think I'm going to quit the kratom since that is sort of in my control, and worry about the klonopin later.  There is nothing I can do about that except find a new Dr.  This is destroying me.  I feel helpless and defeated and hopeless.  Still I'm going to try again.  Any helpful words are appreciated.  Even with the kratom the anxiety is keeping me up all night.  I no longer get a benefit from it, yet I can't quit.  I am going to do it this weekend.  I have a three day weekend, and my wife knows and although she has never been supportive in the past she is going to make an effort this time.  If you've seen my older posts you'd know why I didn't want to tell her.  Thanks for reading this novel.  I need to quit from 30 grams a day.  I've done it before, but I always cave after a week.

However, I would be a liar if i said it hasn‚Äôt helped me too. In fact, a couple beers have made me get through some of the hardest times-when shit was hitting the fan. It made all the difference in the world. It‚Äôs made a lot of my withdrawals successful.

I‚Äôd say if your new and thinking about drinking during wd, be very careful. Most people will say avoid it at all costs. I think it depends on the person. It has made some of my quits, Like make or break.

I would suggest using it when nothing else is working and it‚Äôs becoming a matter of relapse to using Kratom. I would suggest limiting your drinking to 1-3 drinks at moments when you‚Äôre freaking out. I would stay away from hard alcohol completely. This is where people screw themselves. Stick with beer or other drinks that are below 7% alcohol. If you have issues with all drugs/alcohol, don‚Äôt buy huge quantities. By a couple tall boys and that‚Äôs it. If you‚Äôre like myself, if you buy a 12 pack Youll end up drinking all 12. I limit what I purchase and it really has made the difference.

I know other people have different opinions (would love to hear). And if you can avoid drinking all together, than do so. Just my advice and thoughts for some of the newcomers.",6,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.47565854}"

I bought Kratom for the first times months ago and I just took it one time, I liked it but I wanted it to be only for recreational use from time to time. But three weeks ago I didn't have hemp anymore (I smoke hemp because of heavy anxiety problems) and I thought that I could take a bit of kratom meanwhile. the first day I took 4 grams, the next day 4 g and a redose of 5g and the third day 5g and a redose of 5g, the forth day I didn't take any kratom and after that I took only one dose between 4 and 6g a day. Until last sunday I had only one or two days where I didn't use kratom, but I didn't use any kratom for 3 days (from sunday to tuesday) thanks to a friend that gave me a bit of hash, I didn't feel any withdrawals at all but on the 4th day (this day I only had one joint left) I felt a bit of chill or warm feel in my arms but I'm not sure if it was kratom withdrawals at all because it was maybe just in my head after reading a lot this subreddit. Anyway I took kratom this day and still felt a bit the chill/warm feel in my arms, so I think it was in my head since taking kratom didn't change anything. Now I'll finally have my hemp delivery tomorrow or monday and I'll probably take kratom (4g a day) until I have it.

So can I expect to have withdrawals or will it be only in my head if I have some?

2019-11-01 14:04:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/dq7wlg/day_5/,Day 5,"I apologize for the wall of text, but I‚Äôm hoping this might help someone with their recovery. Kratom can be an amazing thing for someone who actually needs it. I for one absolutely do not and have been abusing it on and off for the last 4 years. This WD has been so much easier for me just because of the mindset I have. The really bad ones I‚Äôve gone through were because I ran out and was not ready to get off of it. Those times were absolutely terrible withdrawals that I would never recommend doing. You have to make the conscious decision to meet this head on and know that it will get better. 

On day 5  after a quick taper, was taking 15-30g twice a day down to 12g twice per day, then 6 twice per day, then eventually I said Fuck it and would take 1-3g once per day and when I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I absolutely lost my shit when I took 1g (x2 capsules) in the afternoon and it hit just as hard as when I was taking 10g per dose. I just couldn‚Äôt believe what I had let myself become. I had enough of everything, the guilt of lying about my habit, isolating, passing up opportunities and not being present, only looking forward to my next dose. I‚Äôve held down a solid job the whole time, but I know I would be so much further along if I had been clean this whole time. 

I sarted taking Kratom 4 years ago because my roommate told me the benefits he was getting from taking it. First time I took it ~2g I didn‚Äôt really notice any difference and called him on it not doing anything. I decided to try and just take a teaspoon (definitely more than 2g) and felt sick so I didn‚Äôt take it again for a while. Ended up trying it again for work and it made a world of difference. From that point on I took 3‚Äì4g twice a day for a few months and eventually took more and more until about 6 months passed. 

I definitely felt off when I wasn‚Äôt taking it, but had no idea it was from the Kratom until about a year later when I ran out and went into full blown WDs. Took some k and boom I‚Äôm feeling good again. I developed a habit of taking one unmeasured tablespoon full of k twice a day for another 3 months until I went on a backpacking trip to Europe and couldn‚Äôt find any, for some reason only mild withdrawals for a week or two and then I was back to my normal self. When I got back home the first thing I did was get my bag of Kratom that I knew was there and take an unmeasured spoonful. BOOM right back into it. Couldn‚Äôt go a day without taking it. 

I decided to quit again when I got a job in an isolated area with a friend. There wasn‚Äôt any Kratom there (or so I thought) so I took my last dose and smoked some weed, I actually slept that night. WD‚Äôs weren‚Äôt terrible because I was working construction and going on hikes every single day so I was absolutely exhausted by the time I got home, physical exercise was the #1 thing for me. I felt normal again and with the occasional bouts of missing that high, but there was nothing around so I didn‚Äôt worry. My friend and I go to a secret cliff jumping area in the forest of a very well known national park nearby and see two other people there and get to talking. One of the guys owns a Kratom bar in Florida, FML, hands us a huge bag of Kratom and it took off again. 

From that point on until about a month ago (2 years) I was taking my normal 20g per dose twice a day, sometimes 30g if I felt like I ‚Äúneeded it‚Äù. Those two years have been a blur, I stopped working out (former D1 football starter) lost 40 lbs, looked like shit, ruined relationship with GF. Things have been looking down for the longest time. 

Now things are looking up. I was originally scared to death of RLS and not sleeping, on day 1 I slept 15 minutes, RLS wasn‚Äôt even bad honestly. I worked out really hard before and I think that helps. I laid awake embracing the situation, realizing that it is part of the process and that it will pass as it has before. Day 2 was tough not having that boost of k and working 12 hours, felt like shit, but worked out and felt good for a bit. I can‚Äôt stress enough how much exercise and good food helps. Indica edibles have been a life saver, I‚Äôve been taking about 10mg before bed and have passed out within minutes of falling asleep, of course after doing a very rigorous (1.5-2h) lift and run. I still wake up during the night, but it‚Äôs nothing compared to previous attempts. Day 5 I‚Äôm tired, kind of lethargic, sore, but I‚Äôm so pumped that I‚Äôm on this path. This sub has been a god send as I know I‚Äôm not the only one going through this. Also music is a god send, I made a playlist that really gets me going and can‚Äôt explain how awesome it is. 

I remember I had a small bottle of K capsules in one of my drawers and told my rooommate to dispose of it. I come home to see the bottle on his dresser and asked him wtf it was doing there. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm going to take some of this for work tomorrow.‚Äù I took the bottle and dumped it in the toilet, it felt like I just won a battle or a big football game that I would work so hard for. 

I know it‚Äôs going to be a journey to say the least, but I appreciate all of your stories and it has truly helped me get to this point. I have so much more I could tell, but I don‚Äôt want to take up any more space here. I‚Äôm an open book and if anyone would like to know more please ask. Just talking about it with people helps more than I can explain. Looking forward to all of the pain and suffering to come as I know that‚Äôs how I will grow as a person.",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.39593142}"

I had about 90 days clean from a multiple year habit before relapsing at the beginning of September. I was feeling totally fine, so relapsing was really stupid. I've now been using about 28 gpd for 8 weeks. I tried to quit 2 weeks ago, but I stupidly drank liquor about 24 hours in and gave myself such a bad hangover that I caved the next morning. No drinking this time. I don't even like alcohol, and drinking last time was not justifiable because it wasn't that bad anyway. So, here I go again. I took the last of my good kratom last night. This morning I took a dose of some really, really crappy Maeng Da I had lying around. I normally use Indo and Malay, so Maeng Da doesn't usually scratch the itch for me anyway. I had planned on doing this to get some work done this morning, but all the kratom is now gone and I'm not getting any more. Hopefully the withdrawal isn't too bad after just 8 weeks, but I am aware of the kindling effect, and I've been struggling with this stuff for a decade on and off. I have conveniently been working from home, but I start a new job Monday. I have to be off by then, or I'll definitely have another long term addiction. I won't have time to quit once that starts. I realize I won't be 100% by Monday, but I'm hoping to be functional and maybe over the hump. The first few days at the new job will just be training. Anyhow, just posting here to keep myself honest. Any advice, encouragement, or comments are welcome and appreciated. I'm going to try to stay active this time.

I just lurked and haven't had much to add, but I went CT on Sept 18 of this year. I started using (end at \~70 gpd) 3 or so years ago because of a combination of injury, little money, and no insurance, so the options were to use or do nothing at all, ever. But then things started hurting less, I got a job with decent benefits, and managed to take care of pain through more medical means.  


Anyway, I found that first 5 days of RLS and acute insomnia to be fairly easy compared to PAWS. I've never dealt with depression, never been prone to stress, and had no idea what anxiety felt like before PAWS. By far, they are way worse than the physical symptoms.   


I used gabapentin (like, 3,000mg/day) for the first 2 weeks to mitigate symptoms, but that stuff can cause its own issues long-term so I wanted to get off of that as soon as possible. But I have a high-stress job, so moping around depressed and shutting down from anxiety and insomnia just aren't options, so I've had to come up with ways to deal with it.   


Obviously, exercise helps. But I'm also taking Gaba (between 750-2250 3x/day) along with ginseng and St. John's Wort (3x/day each) to help deal with the psychological factors. It's not perfect, but those at least keep me from hitting any super and completely dysfunctional lows. 

For those who weren't prone to psychological issues before using, how do you deal with the newfound stress, anxiety, and depression? My method kind of works, but I can feel that it's not sustainable in the long-term.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.47874522}"

I've been on Buprenorphine for a year now, after a few years of codeine and heroin addiction. Haven't touched any opiates apart from the bupe and kratom in over a year. But I still feel like an addict because I'm struggling to get off the bupe. 

I wish I had just done a short taper with the bupe, but it's too late now and I feel like my brain is permanently changed, but I know that's not true because with time neural plasticity will rebalance things. 

I tried kratom to help me get off the bupe. But it's expensive here because it's illegal. I was only using it for a week or less, and it helped at first - I felt great on it actually. But then it seemed to stop working so well. I was still experiencing withdrawals and I realised I would have to keep upping my dose for it to work, which is the opposite of what I wanted to do. 

I wanted to believe that it was some kind of miracle cure. But I knew I couldn't afford to buy the amounts I would need and I became skeptical, especially after reading this sub. 

I went back on bupe because at least I know I can feel normal on it, and I don't have to worry about different strains or measuring doses. But even going back on the same dose of bupe that I was on before kratom, I didn't feel normal. I was really sick for a few days and I'm still not feeling back to normal. Stomach troubles, restlessness, anxiety, irritability. It's horrible. Now I've upped my dose of pregabalin again, but I've resisted taking more bupe because all I want is to get off it. 

I'm only on 1mg now, after having been on 16mg for almost a year.

I know there's no way to avoid withdrawals when I jump off, no matter how low of a dose I taper down to, but I want to minimise it as much as possible because the RLS, insomnia, and the extreme malaise are pure torture. 

I really hoped kratom would help with this, that I could switch to kratom for a bit, then taper off the kratom. But now I'm wondering if coming off kratom would be even worse.
