If you need it for pain, it‚Äôs one of the best out there. And it doesn‚Äôt kill you, even if your tolerance is high.

I've never experienced this before only when I quit the kratom did I get this. It gets worse if I drink coffee or do any sort of cardio (including walking around for a bit). I hate it. I'm thinking of going back to the doctor but I doubt they'd find anything since they didn't last time and it's not as bad now as it was then.

My question is... Since I dropped from 500mg to 250mg, I feel nauseous and lethargic. 

Also, I have been experiencing twitches and tremors and jerks while tapering. Plus, my anxiety is terrible. 

Originally, I attributed the muscle symptoms to the fact that I was quitting gabapentin and a nootropic stack.

However, that was 5 months ago and the twitching settled down until I started tapering Kratom. Now, they are back with a vengeance and I am experiencing occasional muscle weakness and soreness, pain, etc. 

I am most worried about the tremors. I had an EMG + Nerve Conduction Study 90 days ago and the Neurologist said that every was fine and I don't have any signs of any disease. Plus, my bloodwork, 1 month ago showed no inflammation or elevated CK levels.

So... Would my small dosage cause withdrawal symptoms, even though I am only cutting 250mg/week or so?

Never been on pharma that can cause a withdrawal, so this is a first withdrawal for me. Quit cold turkey from relatively low daily dose of 6-8 gpd for the past 2 years. Low enough that I didn't expect anything major. I was also drinking alcohol every day since this COVID thing started, but not an extreme amount - also quitting that temporarily.

Sorry if this is long, it helps to write about it.

For reference I only quit because I started having extreme urinary urgency and it seemed likely that kratom was the cause after all my tests came out negative. Before this I had a relatively positive outlook on kratom, but was lowering my dose anyway.

Day 1-4: urinary problems are intense, depression sets in and i am crying like a baby to my wife, who tries and help with meditation (which was a great release). Taking 0.25mg-0.5mg Xanax at night to sleep (for the urinary issues not kratom). Start feeling better emotionally on day 3, am able to work out twice a day to lessen symptoms.

Day 5:  Have a pretty decent day, urinary stuff sucks and is worrying me so i am in contact with the doctor for meds for that, but withdrawals seem to be emotional only. Decide to drink that night for ""date night"" with my wife. Feel a little ""off"", not getting the usual buzz from alcohol. Start focusing heavily on my breathing in the evening and have anxiety attacks all night. Can't get my breath. Want to take Xanax to sleep but  have been drinking. So I wait 4 hours of hell, pacing and not being able to catch my breath (heart rate is not elevated during this), take a small amount of Xan and fall asleep. The only thing that helps is sitting in a bath running my hands under hot water. During all this my urinary symptoms disappear *for good,* no idea why.

Day 6: Wake up and immediately can't catch my breath, feels like I am not getting enough air. Have a therapy appointment in the morning, she gives tips on regulating breathing. They don't work. Doctor says he'll prescribe some allergy/asthma meds (I have allergy-induced asthma) but tells me to go to ER if needed. It gets worse, lasts hours, so I go to the ER. They put me in the COVID tent because I am having shortness of breath. Holy shit. Now there's some anxiety. I almost passed out multiple times while they basically ignored me. Doctor finally checks me out, x-rays, checks vitals and lungs, all good, sent home with a short run of Ativan. Take 1mg immediately and it conks me out, take a nap, wake up...breathing issues again. Ups and downs all day, have to take 0.5mg of Ativan in the evening due to anxiety attacks again. Manage to fall asleep without any further dosage.

Day 7: Same issues. Ups and downs all day. Allergies are so bad and exacerbate the breathing/anxiety. Manage to feel a little better and decide to try and work out. Get four sets in and am gasping for breath. The breathing issue feels *real,* not just anxiety. Freaks me out more, anxiety attacks in and out until it's time to sleep and I take 0.5mg Ativan.

Day 8 (yesterday): Same issues with ups and downs, allergies feel a little better but still have breathing attacks. Wife is gone all day for the first time, so this makes things a lot worse. Afternoon is hell, try and ask doctor if I should start predisone in case this is an actual lung issue. They don't recommend as it can antagonize my anxiety but prescribe just in case (haven't taken it). By the time my wife is home my symptoms are crescendoing. Other things start coming in. Pain in the back and some in the chest. Feeling woozy, almost high. In the evening in literally feels like a bad acid trip. Breathing issues calm down and are replaced with extreme anxiety, light depersonalization, lights are bright, can't sit still and feeling like I am buzzing with electricity. Don't want to take the Ativan because I am avoiding a benzo withdrawal on top of this but eventually have to. Take only 0.5mg and eventually feel like i am drunk, limbs jello, everything jello. Fall asleep and sleep through the night fine.

Day 9 (today): Breathing problems as intense as ever, no panic (heart rate normal), just consistent. Seems mostly tied to anxiety but it's so hard to tell. If I am not thinking about it too closely i don't notice it, but still do seem to need to take a big breath every now and then. Decided to write about it.

Last night was one of the worst experiences in my entire life. It was akin to the worst acid trip I've ever had. Throughout this all I can think is ""I WISH I TAPERED"", and seriously am considering starting a taper. I have tapered before, and my dose is low anyway, so I am not sure it's worth this level of trouble. My only worry is that I'll taper and this will all happen again all over.

I have to be a normal human being and go to work on Tuesday (have already taken multiple days off), so am considering reverting to a taper if I don't see improvements by Monday. The doctor has prescribed Lexapro, but I am really not excited to start another drug to replace kratom.

Things I am currently taking:Benzo only at night (0.25mg xan or 0.5mg ativan)Black seed oil (1 tsp/day)Alvesco (hopefully long term relief from the breathing issue if it's related to asthma)Albuterol (hasn't worked yet)Rhinocort (for nasal allergies)Various supplements (turmeric, multivitamin, 10 mil. probiotic)

**TL:DR: Terrible shortness of breath and anxiety symptoms and an ER visit leading me to consider tapering as opposed to my current day 9 cold turkey. Used to work out every day now can barely go on a walk.**

Welcoming recommendations for supplements for my particular issues, if anybody has any. Considering taking DHEA (in case I am having adrenal issues), agmatine, ashwagandha, and b5. As mentioned, the only ""withdrawal"" thing I am taking so far is black seed oil.

&nbsp;

I wanted to provide a quick update on my progress, both as a reference for others, and for a personal reminder should I ever experience any desire to return to kratom. 

&nbsp;

Day 10: This was a good day, and the first day since day 5 I had any energy or motivation. Definitely seemed like a turning point. Still have minor lingering physical effects, but they‚Äôre annoying rather than agonizing.

&nbsp;

Days 11-12: Again feeling lethargic and unmotivated. GI symptoms still persist, along with minor RLS. Frustratingly, insomnia has been worsening after not being a major issue. Waking up after an hour of sleep burning hot and drenched in sweat.

&nbsp;

Days 13-15: I went on vacation these days, and felt pretty good. Was able to drive 3 hours without getting restless. My appetite is normalizing, along with digestive ‚Äòproblems‚Äô. I don‚Äôt have a ton of energy, but I‚Äôm not struggling through every hour either. This feels close to normal. Insomnia is still bad, and cravings for alcohol (but not kratom) have surfaced. I never drank significantly or had an alcohol problem before kratom, but this stage in the process has always entailed struggling with other substances for me. A single drink or even a dose of pseudoephedrine can trigger a serious binge. I have to remain vigilant. 

&nbsp;

Day 16: This day was horrible for some reason. After a night of little sleep, I had the strongest brain fog I‚Äôve experienced. I also felt rather dissociated, like I was in a dream the whole day. I normally feel like this to a small degree after returning from vacation, so perhaps that combined with PAWS caused these bizarre feelings. 

&nbsp;

Day 17-18: These days were just very flat. Everything seemed rather dull. Still not getting good sleep. 

&nbsp;

Day 19-20: Finally getting some energy and motivation back. Mood seems variable throughout the day. For longer stretches, feeling normal and able to accomplish things I‚Äôve been putting off because of withdrawal. These are the first days I had any interest in doing work. 

&nbsp;

That concludes my withdrawal summary until this point. I‚Äôm very excited about having three weeks kratom-free tomorrow. I hope this post will remind me how arduous quitting can be, so that I might avoid repeating this miserable experience!

It‚Äôs mind blowing because I thought kratom was weaker than other opioids and I‚Äôve never actually had a chance to compare like this. 20 grams of kratom gets me just as high as taking 50 mg of oxycodone . 

It shows me that it‚Äôs just as potent and evil as any other opiate . I plan on stopping cold turkey with kratom and oxy tomorrow. I just wanted to share this experience with y‚Äôall because it blew my mind. It‚Äôs not cool how it‚Äôs touted as a weak and safe alternative to opiates but it‚Äôs just as strong if you take enough. I really hate how people say the withdrawals are similar to coming off coffee. People who say that are so ignorant and it grinds my gears. 

I hope everyone‚Äôs day is going well and my hats off to all of you going through the recovery process right now. Wish me luck with my CT tomorrow. hopefully it isn‚Äôt bad since I‚Äôve only used for 5 days. I‚Äôm tapering off klonopin right now too so I‚Äôm pretty sensitive to withdrawals.

Not going back, but a struggle all the same","It's been up and down since I quit five weeks ago, as many people on this subreddit can attest to. I used a lot for a long time, and have struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life. Those both got bad at the end of my usage, but have definitely intensified during the withdrawal process. I've quit many times before, but this is the first time I'm really, deep within myself, believing that I'll never use again. Honestly, mainly because I'm too afraid of disappointing the love of my life. Already disappointed in myself enough already (not only for this, but I know many of you probably feel the same, as often addiction seems to come from shame and pain)/

For those who are trying to quit, YOU CAN DO IT. I felt trapped for a long, long time. If possible, I'd recommending finding ONE person to reach out to. Just having someone who knows what you're going through is helpful, even if they don't understand. Just try to realize that they'll never understand, but that they love you and want to support you. The total isolation is so hard. For me at least, it really exacerbated the symptoms. This is the first time I've gone through this process with someone on my team, and I really think it will be the last, all because of that.

I wish you all the best of luck! You can do this! Even without someone to support you, it is possible. We're all here to help. I'm not feeling perfect, but definitely a lot better than in the thick of withdrawals. I'm saving money, I'm eating normally, and most importantly (for me, at least), I can live an honest life. Didn't realize that Kratom was just another way to live a lie.

Question regarding mucus/sinuses and kratom,"Okay so this is a very difficult time for me. I have to say goodbye to this plant for good. It‚Äôs just not as innocent as I believed in the past. I am commited though. Since January I had been taking 2 tablespoons once a day. Once quarantine started in March I began taking 2 tablespoons twice a day. Rarely missed a dose! Originally I never intended to have it become a daily thing. Upset with myself.

My reason for quitting is realizing that I am completely dependant on it. When I miss dose my nose gets runny, I feel like shit, Inget irritable and anxious. Also some increased tinnitus, although that may be due to something else I have (TMJ Dysfunction). Either way I have a question:

So I feel like I have fluid behind my eardrums. My ears are always very crackly, at times my hearing is slightly muffled. A feeling of pressure too. The fact that kratom dries out my allergies and runny nose, I have a little theory. Could kratom cause mucus to dry and get stuck in the sinuses? Particularly the eustachian tubes which allow our ears to pop and regulate air pressure. Since i‚Äôve been tapering I can feel the blocked ears clearing extremely slowly. Everytime I take a dose though they feel congested again until the k starts wearing off. This is something I never noticed until I started tapering down. Scary feeling to me.

At about 2 a.m. after day 7 (technically day 8) I found a small stash I knew was hiding around. Something took over and I decided, ""what the hell it's been 7 full days, once wont hurt and I'll feel great."" 

All totally wrong...it felt terrible after putting back a 4gr dose, so terrible that I took another 4gr after two hours...

I went to bed around 5am after that and it was so weird. My body kept having those ""falling sensations"" but it was more like contorting. I would feel myself flail and contort, like I was rolling head over heels, but then I'd wake up still laying flat. Went on until about 7am when I finally was asleep. 

Now waking up...past noon which I'd finally changed through my CT process....I feel disgusting. So hung over, and just frustrated. The stash is gone, and I dont want to reach back after that experience...but I was doing so well on day 7 that idk why I let myself do this. 

So whether I keep saying this is day 8...or I'm back to day 1, it's just a shitty feeling. I do need to forgive it and stop feeling so down, but I'm just so disgusted to wipe the amazing progress I had going. 

Maybe the WD's wont be as terrible after 1 slip up, but i am definitely worried. I was making such good steps to get active, rekindle relationships, and started playing my instrument...but today I just feel empty again right like i did on days 1, 2, 3,4 and 5. And I really dont want to admit to those around me who knew I was cleaning up that it happened.

2020-05-29 16:34:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/gt0rh6/taper_10_per_week/,Taper 10% per Week,"I started tapering down from 50-60gpd in early February 2020, pretty aggressively since I can't seem to do anything in moderation. Initially I was dropping my dosage by 10% every 7 days, but I experimented a bit to realize I could just barely get away with making the same reduction twice a week. I would advise dropping once every week. My body and brain just have a tendency to burn through drugs like The Rolling Stones so almost everything exits my system very quickly.

When I got down to 6gpd on March 30th I jumped, since I quite literally had nothing to do anyway. I could have tapered further I suppose, but discomfort was pretty minimal. Yawning and tearing eyes just reminded me of anticipating heroin withdrawal, so it was more anxiety inducing than anything.

I was parachuting ~9 doses per day to keep my blood levels of the different alkaloids somewhat even throughout each day. I did that from the time I started taking kratom regularly until I took my last dose.

Before accidentally discovering the euphoric properties of the kratom plant, I had been clean for 1 year and 4 months from a 2-3 gram a day potent IV heroin habit, which itself went on and off over the course of 5 years. So I can say with certainty that while kratom withdrawal isn't as nightmarish, it still sucks ass. Obviously ymmv depending on dosage, duration, and prior dependencies. After taking it for a while I felt awful when on it and horrible when trying to kick it cold, so tapering seemed to be my only option.

I weighed my doses for each day out with a hundredths scale that ran me all of about 10 dollars. Without the ability to measure my reductions, it never would have been successful. Taking 9-10 smaller doses per day helped immensely to avoid highs and lows, making tapering much easier.

I was exercising from before I started tapering and continue to, almost 2 months after I took my last baby dose. I love weightlifting, but cardio/endurance exercises helped the most with anxiety, depression, restless legs, etc. Stretching routines are also kick ass.
Low dose melatonin was very helpful for sleep more often than not. I would recommend 0.25 to 0.5 mg to start and take more if needed. Less is more with melatonin.
The lower my dose got, the more unsurprisingly sensitive I became to caffeine again. By the time I jumped, I switched out coffee for tea and was much less jittery. Cutting caffeine pills also worked to reduce intake but avoid headaches.
Aleve (Naproxen Sodium) is your friend as long as you can safely take NSAIDs.

I'm sure I'm missing lots of important info, but that's the meat and potatoes of it. Hopefully this helps someone as much as the posts I lurked on helped me to quit. The joy of freedom is just waiting for you to take it back. ;)",15,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.40966025}"

So I played around with it and BANG! Just as advertised. But it was expensive, so it was slow going.

Then I found a cheap quality vendor and all bets were off.

It would launch me into the day at a thousand miles an hour. I never got the sedation thing, I have a very negative response to opioids throwing up etc... But the energy and pain relief was great.

Saw the Netflix documentary on Kratom and knew a friend was taking it & had some ordered before the final credits were rolling. 

I was physically & emotionally exhausted. Years of working 2 jobs, single parent, grind, grind, grind and Bob your Uncle. It helped me manage long shifts and General despair. 

Eventually the doses no longer worked their magic. Higher doses did not help. I was getting hot flashes and lost all motivation. It was dictated by the tiny window between taking Kratom and needing more Kratom. 

Prices in Canada are super high. It started to become an expensive habit. I calculated $2000 in the 1.5 years. Not high doses. (15 gpd)

In December I fell down the stairs and found myself in WD at ER. That was a nasty feeling. I was in excruciating pain & the hydro morphine did nothing. That is when I knew I was in trouble. 

This thread helped motivate me. Once the lockdown started I knew it would be an opportunity to quit. I am a big baby with WD so I did a gradual taper. Every week I took a little less. Bad weeks meant taking the same dose as a previous week. No pressure. No rush. 

I will be honest. The last 1.2gpd was hard, but soon I realized i could not feel that low a dose. In the end I just was busy one day and before I knew it it was 6pm.

Some folks here have been wonderful in their replies to my posts.   Thank you and I am sorry if you feel efforts have been in vain. The constant suspicion in my daughters yes is a knife to my spirit.   My partner is at wits end, with one foot out the door.   Friends have been long gone.  Even my dog seems to be disgusted with me---So enough self pity.

What I 'd like to hear (again I'm a slow learner and I need repetition) is what to expect with ct from a relatively high dosage.  I have gabapentin  and bought  DLPA ,GABA, L-tyrosine, vitamins C,D, B and a multi.   I also can arrange to veg out for 3 to 5 days.   Anything that really helped you I'd love to hear about  (can't get marijuana in my state)

&#x200B;

  
What do you  suggest I actually do?   When my taper was working I did alot of crossword puzzles but couldn't focus to read or watch films.  Staying still was torture even though I was exhausted.   

Did anyone develop an addiction to gabapentin?   If it worked for you how much and how often did you take it?   Anybody try kanna tea?  Read here that provigil can help but I assume thats once you are completely off kratom--is that a correct assumption?

I am 64 and I wish I could convey to you younger folks who may be on the fence  that addiction truly is progressive and horribly destructive.   It gets so much harder.  You  truly get so far down you have to reach up to touch bottom.   

Anyway I am turning over my money and car keys to my weary and patient partner  (he did start out holding the kratom for me but I drove him crazy with my manipulations)  and will try to ct day after tomorrow.

   Thanks for listening (reading)

So here‚Äôs the things I‚Äôve noticed...the first time I CT about 1 1/2 years ago I had jumped on Kratom straight from Opiates, and in all honestly from what I can recall the RLS at nightfall was the worst, but all in all that CT was so much worse than this CT a week ago now. I guess because I never detoxed my body from the pills, that‚Äôs why it was worse. I‚Äôm now on day 5 CT (2nd quit) and feeling great, my RLS was barely noticeable lastnight and hell wasn‚Äôt even terrible the first 2-3 nights tbh. So for those of you that read this and maybe having second thoughts about how terrible the WD‚Äôs are DO NOT BE AFRAID! It‚Äôs so worth it.

I will tell you if you can get your doctor to write RX for Adderall and Xanax and get something for RLS at night, makes a hell of a difference.

First 5 days were hell as most have said; what I've noticed the most in protracted withdrawal (beyond the obvious - increased restlessness, time feeling longer, less ""high"") is that I basically do not have very strong coping mechanisms with any kind of stress.  


Caffeine, low sleep, overeating, and alcohol hangovers have helped catalyzed a few moments over the past few weeks where it felt like I NEEDED something - like I couldn't do anything without it. taking more K was never an option for me because I have moved on, but i responded to anxiety probably triggered by a hangover and lack of sleep by taking caffeine, which amplified it, or taking alcohol after having more than the normal usual coffee dose.   


The point is - the substance and its effects were irrelevant. Our ""muscles"" for relaxing ourselves or getting whatever psychological reaction we need have atrophied because of this crutch that we have.  


My initial impulse was to simply try to control the urges (caffeine, alcohol) and make that my main focus - but time has showed that while positive, this actually shouldn't be the main objective. Actually, focusing on substances in either a restrictive or exploitive way (ex: supplements) I think should be the opposite of everything we practice. We have to learn to sit with bad feelings and let them pass - and do positive things (meditation, reading, hobbies) to restore a better mental state.   


I actually think there are certain activities (too much exercise, too much dieting) that give credence and more importance to our ""anxieties"" that actually make urges WORSE - i have found the absolute best thing isn't meditation, journaling, or anything - it's literally just going through your day. without anything. Living.

My kratom use averaged 25g/day for 15 months with the last 6 months being arduous to say the least.  Sleepless nights here and there, hot flashes, and a genuine disdain for doing anything to better myself afforded me the gumption to hop off the sludge and discover myself again and what a ride it has been.

My withdrawal period has been at a 2, on a scale of 1 to 10, of what I projected it to be and I had tried to get off several times before but with little success.  Being an everyday user for the 15 months started taking a toll on EVERYTHING in my life as I am a prolific addict and alcoholic who got sober 3 years ago only to stumble across Kratom midway through and fell victim to its innocent nature but I have no regrets.  There was a learning lesson on this journey for myself that using kratom was not for me and I was diminishing my utility to helping others and making an impact in this world. I am not entirely sure what everyone would want to know about my success in getting off the kratom so I'll provide a general timeline since I grabbed a hold of my life again devoid of Kratom. 

Day 1- find a way to pass time and not be in your head; remember why you are doing this and what's at stake if you don't.  CBD oil, vitamins, and lil' reef helped me significantly.  Slight hot and cold periods, sneezing, yawning, and discomfort throughout the day but somehow slept 5 hours which was to my surprise.

Day 2- Rough RLS (Restless Leg Syndrome), no appetite, and honestly didn't know what to do with myself without jonesin' for my next dose.  I spent time at my gf's memorial day party and just found a way to kill time.  A little ibuprofen helped me but the RLS at night was the worst of this whole experience but it was gone after sleeping 6 hours.

Day 3- Raw emotions and discovering my truth.  Symptoms were anxiety, loose stool, and still waiting for the the WD's to smack me in the face but it never came. The mind is a powerful tool to overcome addiction.  Read, Listen to Music, spend time with people you haven't been with because of the alienation and shame from using Kratom

Day 4-  Slept 5 hours, woke up feeling like a brand new person because I broke it off with my wonderful girlfriend of 7 months the night before to work on myself and overcome these obstacles in my life. Exercised all day and felt like I was on a natural high.  Started to take a look with great optimism as to what was next for me, being free from kratom and with no GF.  

Day 5-  Slept 6 hours and wasn't even sore from yesterday's workout, disc golf, and tennis session that I hadn't done since I first drank the sludge.  I woke up and did 3 loads of laundry, which is more than I had done in the last 3 months.  Appetite is returning, and I feel like a completely fresh and new person.

\*\*\*\*\*My Best Support\*\*\*\*\*\*

\-- Get out of your head and do it because if you were like me, you were not living life to the fullest while on kratom and delaying the inevitable

\-- Everyone is different; make your own way to freedom because in  every difficulty there is an island of opportunity so swim out there and get your life back

\--Don't hide out; be with people and face your fears.  Meditation, AA, the Bible were paramount for me.

Interestingly, I have found lots of silver linings in this pandemic, and it has made me a more positive person ironically, than before (being able to appreciate all the things I have), but the kratom use/that emptiness persist.

Essentially for me, it's different from a normal sadness, it's this melancholy feeling where I just feel empty and it feels even worse than being sad, and the fact that it doesn't seem to be caused by any particular thing makes me feel helpless. This fear is what's keeping me from making the leap. I keep going from my normal 10gpd to 5gpd and then up because I'm scared of what I'll do without it. I quit weed and nic already during this quarantine, and it's almost like I'm trying to justify holding onto kratom a bit longer (been using daily for 6 months now), when in the back of my head I know the right thing to do is quit. 

Has anyone else dealt with this emptiness and sadness, particularly at night? I'd compare it to sunday night blues times 100, every day. I am on an antidepressant and am doing mindfulness meditation often, but find that mindfulness helps me identify the cause of emotions but doesn't help when I get a wave of sadness that doesn't seem to be caused by anything.

I happened upon this last night and subsequently created an account to post. I‚Äôve been using kratom for a solid 4 years, and when I say 4 years I mean every single day for 4 years. I honestly don‚Äôt know how much as I quit using tsp and tbsp a while back. I‚Äôm gunna guesstimate that I‚Äôve been taking around 30 grams a day, give or take. 

De-fucking-termined to be done with this...Today, I measured each dose and, as of now (930 at night) have taken 16 grams. I spent the entire day in a fog, feeling crappy (but only very mild withdrawal symptoms) and trying to distract myself in the garden and looking at the clock incessantly for when I was allowing myself to take more. So obnoxious and I can‚Äôt imagine doing this for weeks or months. My plan was to do 16 a day for a week then cut down week 2 yatty ya. Honestly, I really would rather go cold turkey , but I‚Äôm a single mom of 2 kids... still not working because of covid (and probably not until fall because I work with kids) and I have my two kids 24/7 because there‚Äôs no school.

I‚Äôve woken up a few times in what I assume are acute withdrawals and am absolutely positive I cannot go CT. I have a family and demanding job and I‚Äôm a wimp. The absolute worst part for me is the insomnia brought on by creepy crawly skin and RLS, I just cannot take it! 

Anyway, I‚Äôve been reading your posts for weeks, just trying to collect information on the best way for me to quit, and I‚Äôve decided a taper is the best way for me. I‚Äôve collected a bunch of supplements and other meds to aid in the process, as I‚Äôm hoping to make this as painless as possible. The problem is, I‚Äôm not sure how much and when I should be taking of all of this stuff. 

As far as supplements go, I have: Magnesium, calcium, super vitamin b complex, Liposomal Vitamin C, Ashwaganda, Valerian root, L-theanine, SAM-e, Passion flower and Black seed oil. 

I also have clonazepam, gabapentin, and lorazepam. (I have zero affinity for these types of meds, but have access to them and am down to use them if it helps with the insomnia and creepy crawlies). 

I was thinking about grabbing adrafinil (because lethargy is a huge part of why I started taking kratom) and loperamide (because I do not always have access to a quick bathroom at my job). 

My plan is to start taking the supplements tomorrow with the first day of my taper, and then using the prescription meds as needed once I jump for good. 

My question is, does this sound like a good plan? Should I save some of the supplements for the jump or are they all appropriate for the taper too? Are all those supplements ok to take together? Could some of them replace another and so it‚Äôs pointless to double up? What time of day should I take which supplements? Am I missing any other aid? Do I have way too much? What dose of the prescription meds should I be taking when I jump? For how long?

I have struggled with addiction with to pills(opiates) as well, so before long K was easily transformed into a daily habit. It's so hard to stay the path. I am and continue to plan on being a pot head, and I am perfectly ok with that but it just doesn't feel like enough sometimes. I feel guilty because I have an amazing little girl who needs me, and dont get me wrong I am there for her but it seems like the years are blurring by, its like I was just pregnant with her and now she's turning 3. I dont want to look back and regret how I treated her childhood as if it wasn't fleeting. I want to be really present for her, and not in a haze.  Years fly by at this point.

I had chosen to rip the bandaid off and quit cold turkey.

I was already hurting by the next day, so I decided to clean and organize my walk-in closet to keep myself busy. As fate would have it, I found a small baggy that had about 8 grams of kratom left in it stashed at the bottom of my suitcase. Being in the early stages of acutes, I didn‚Äôt even really attempt to talk myself out of it, so down it went. ‚ÄújUsT OnE LaSt dOse!!‚Äù ...you know how it goes.

I have no idea how much time passed after that, but the next thing I remember is coming to on my bathroom floor feeling like I had just been hit by an 18 wheeler while my husband frantically hovered over me talking to 911 dispatch. I felt really hot and clammy, but when I went to wipe the sweat off of my head, my forearm came back covered in blood. Apparently when I lost consciousness, I hit my head on the same toilet where I bid kratom farewell just 24 hours earlier. The irony is just too much.

So off we went to the emergency room in an area that‚Äôs getting hit hard by Covid. After hours of waiting, stitches, tests, and more waiting, they finally informed me that I had a tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure, likely caused by the kratom. Apparently kratom behaves very similarly to tramadol, which is known to lower your seizure threshold even if you don‚Äôt have epilepsy. I‚Äôd never experienced a seizure before this in my entire life. How ironic that it literally happened after my very last dose of kratom ever. Kratom is like that crazy ex girlfriend... ‚ÄúOh yeah!? You‚Äôre going to leave ME!? Enjoy your seizure babe!‚Äù

Please please please learn from my mistakes. If I hadn‚Äôt given in, I‚Äôd be nearly 72 hours CT right now, miserable, but well on my way out of the woods. Instead, ‚Äújust one more dose‚Äù has me back at 18 hours CT, in unimaginable discomfort on top of the withdrawal, and awaiting a hospital bill that we definitely can‚Äôt afford right now. All for the opportunity to feel numb for a couple hours for the thousandth time. What‚Äôs even scarier is that I‚Äôd actually considered going to the grocery store after I dosed.

2020-05-27 07:35:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/gri2uj/another_friendly_reminder/,Another friendly reminder,"Hello all. I‚Äôm on day 55ish of my second successful quit . My first successful quit was in August 2017 and I only stayed clean for about two months before starting to take it again out of boredom and to enhance my activities. This led to 2.5 more years of use and here I am. 

I‚Äôd like to share some of my experiences, the first time I quit, I started to drink black tea, and I noticed this made me feel good so it became a daily thing. I was buying glass bottles of Tejava tea from the store and drinking an entire bottle each day, worked my way up to two bottles. And I also started to smoke cigarettes and tobacco nightly. I would often combine these things together to get the most rush. I believe the reason I was drinking so much black tea was because of the caffeine buzz, and the Theanine it contains balances it so you don‚Äôt become anxious. and the cigarettes were clearly for the buzz. Which eventually went away. 


This time though it was different, I did use caffeine for the first 4 weeks. This helped with the fatigue/depression. But ultimately I know long term it‚Äôs not good to consume caffeine everyday. And cigarettes. Don‚Äôt even get me started on those. 


The very first time I used drugs I was 13, and ever since then I‚Äôve just fallen back onto something else every time I quit. This is the very first time in my life since I was 13 that I am completely off of all substances and I feel so good. I haven‚Äôt felt this stable in a long time. I still have bad moments where things irritate me, but I don‚Äôt get pissed and lose it for like an hour like I used to on Kratom. 

Basically I just wanted to share two things. 

1. If you have quit, please don‚Äôt go back to using as so many of us do. Don‚Äôt sabotage yourself like that. There is no bartering with yourself. There can‚Äôt be a ‚Äúonce a week‚Äù thing or ‚Äújust once‚Äù. Once you‚Äôve been addicted to Kratom you really need to let it go forever in order to truly defeat this addiction.

2. I think everyone should try their best to avoid swapping addictions.  I know many people here are using pharmaceutical medications to help them quit , and I can‚Äôt blame you all for that. But I will say, that I did take anti depressants for many years of my life and I truly believe they can be just as harmful if not more than street drugs. All drugs can be harmful. Especially when you use them daily.   I believe it‚Äôs best for everyone to be their natural self. And I think anyone who uses these crutches to help free themselves from Kratom should start to get off of them as soon as they regain their strength and feel like they are no longer in the ‚Äúdanger of relapse‚Äù zone.  I know it sucks at first, but if you‚Äôre patient, and give your body some time, your brain will rebalance itself. Especially if you practice healthy life style habits.

I tried tapering a few months ago and I did not have the self-control to stay with it. Something bad would happen or I just felt bad and felt like I needed to get high. I'm so tired of always feeling like I need to escape my world. Yeah it's not always easy, but that's life for most people and I don't even remember what it was like to feel sober, clear headed, healthy and happy. I tend to drink to much alcohol too which I've been trying to change, but it's not the same as kratom. I don't HAVE to drink. I'm not physically dependant on it. I just like to. And I don't like what it's doing to my life. So.... I'm really wanting to be better and I'm scared. Scared of the withdrawals, scared of relapsing and going through all of that for nothing again. I'm pretty sure though this time that I'd like to get some help from my doctor for the wd. I have talked to him about it already and he started me on buspirone a couple of months ago. Are there any meds that really help with the restless leg or insomnia? I know it's not going to be easy but I'd like to keep myself from relapsing and I really need my sleep. I don't function well at all without it. Also will my withdrawal be worse this time around since I have added another year of daily use? The time I quit before I had taken it for about a year and now it's two or two and a half. I'd appreciate any advice or tips and I thank you kindly.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.52742296}"

I have in fact stuck the course so far and am on Day 11. 

What I have noticed is all of my physical withdrawal symptoms are gone, even the diarrhea which seemed to take the longest. I slept 10 hours last night and I believe sleep might be the greatest supplement of all. All those thousands of nights I spent never truly getting a good nights sleep, always waking up on the precipice of hell. I can finally sleep sound knowing that I defeated Kratom, scourged from my system like the poison that it was.

I believe I have finally entered the mental phase of my recovery and my biggest symptom is that I feel nothing. Not that I feel nothing but that I do not derive much happiness from anything at the moment and I am content with this. I know that this, along with the physical withdrawals will not last forever and feeling base like this is still miles better than being shackled in mitragyna chains. 

What have I been taking or doing the last 11 days? Exercising everyday and following it up with a protein/tart cherry shake, 500mg of magnesium and taking a mens multi vitamin. This for the most part is all I have done as far as supplements go and I cannot stress that time/sleep and an unconquerable willpower to quit will be your best supplements to take. Magnesium and sunshine are close seconds...

What have I rediscovered? I rediscovered my love for music, my love for movies and my love for my wife most of all. She was there throughout it all, even in my throes of addiction and never once left my side. I have a lot to make up to her because it was my selfishness that did this, I cannot explain it any other way. 

I also did a lot of introspection into my past, especially during the days when I was withering on the floor in pain. I found out that I have always had drug seeking behavior and Kratom was the drug that ""stuck."" I know a lot of people compare Kratom to other opiates but to be honest Kratom is like the working mans heroin, a laborers dream come true. Unlike other drugs you can function normally while on Kratom and I think that is what makes it so addiction prone and dangerous. It kills you slowly not fast.

I am about 48 hours kratom free from a sort of taper in which I tapered down then relapsed then tapered down again. This time I don't have any extra kratom laying around so I think it will be more successful considering I would have to buy more to get back into it.

There are a few reasons why im quitting. Perhaps the most important one is I want to be somewhere else in my life and I feel as if kratom was hindering that. Since moving back to my state from leaving the Marine Corps 2 years ago, I have not developed an adequate social life. I feel as if this is important. When I did hang out with people I felt sort of a medicated zombie while on kratom. I didn't feel as if I needed to be anything else, and didn't care because at the end of the day I would take kratom and deprive some pleasure out of it. My source of pleasure and comfort was not found by socializing with people, but from kratom.

I just want to give you an update on my taper and perhaps you could give some suggestions or share some of your experiences. After two years of using approximately 45 g/d I decided to quit for a while and so I decided to do a taper. Right now, I'm on day 8 of my taper and it really is much easier than expected. I'll share yesterday's taper journal entry with you;

25th of May, 2020

13:30: 1,5g

18:45: 1,5g

20:55: 6g

24:00: 1,5g

Total: 10,5g

""Day 8 of my taper! I had a decent night of sleep, actually, it was quite good. I slept from 03:00 until 10:00 and only woke up once. I couldn‚Äôt fall asleep, though, so I decided to take some melatonin and it worked. [This night I even had a full night of sleep!] Today, I‚Äôll cut off 1,5 grams of my daily intake because I can wait another hour from 20:00 till 21:00 for my evening dose. That‚Äôll be a daily intake of 10,5 grams! Tomorrow, I‚Äôll drop 0,5 grams of my evening dose and then slowly work down. Let‚Äôs see how today goes. Couple of things: 1) There will be ups and downs, but stick to it! 2) Don‚Äôt overanalyze things because that‚Äôs the worst thing to do and 3) Stay strong! The withdrawal of this morning really is very minor. I mean, it‚Äôs there, but 90% of it is mental. I can go easy now, despite some discomfort, for six hours without a dose. Or even longer? Perhaps I can postpone it to 01:30 PM if I eat something right now (YES I DID IT)? Also, remember the time when you mentally have it worst is between 07:00 PM and 09:00 PM (at least yesterday this was the case). Read your journal by then! I‚Äôm now feeling the effects (T+30min) of my first 1,5 grams dose and I definitely think my tolerance has gone down. It feels like 2,5 or 3 grams a bit. Yeah! My taper is going really well so far. Walked my dog with a friend and his dog at around 17:00 and the withdrawal is more minimal right now than the previous days. Took my second dose at 18:45 and my taper is going like a charm. There‚Äôs a little mental craving right now, but I won‚Äôt ever go up. Something in my brain definitely clicked.""

So, I'm down to about 10 grams/day in, like what, 7 days? What an achievement. I was expecting much, much worse guys, but really it's a cakewalk if you just stick to it. If I can bring it down to 5 grams by the end of this week I might just drop. I took my last 1,5 grams dose at midnight and now it's 11 in the morning, so almost 12 hours in between a dose and I'm just feeling a little off and cold, but that's basically it. If I really want to go hard on myself I think I could wait untill 6 PM for my first dose, but hey let's go a little easy on yourself. I'm really astonished that in merely a week I dropped from 45 g/d to 10 g/d with some withdrawal, sure, but it's easy if you stay strong mentally and stay active.

The slow taper seems to have given enough time for repair to happen while slowly reducing the dosage.  The withdrawal is nothing, but the fatigue when quitting CT is unbearable.

All the money I spent when it could‚Äôve and should‚Äôve went to my family. That‚Äôs yet another motivator for me to keep going. Whatever it takes right?  Find your motivators, even when it hurts to admit them. Even if you feel shame and guilt. Look at how you‚Äôve been living and do something about it. It‚Äôs never gonna be easy, believe me I know, but find the things you hate the most about your kratom use and put it behind the wheel. I‚Äôm so proud of all of you, those who have quit, those tapering, those making a plan and those thinking about it. We‚Äôre all in this together. :)",13,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5418322}"

Kratom started out as something a friend showed me for a small high and good for insomnia, and it took just about everything slowly over the years. I‚Äôm a long term user, everyday since 2017 first time in 2015. 
I‚Äôm at 60 GPD. Over the years, I‚Äôve dropped out of high school, worked 5 days a week just to simply survive, and afford this stuff. I got in a severe car crash that turned into a year and a half legal battle, I‚Äôve done things I never thought I would do. I‚Äôve lied I don‚Äôt know how many times to my parents over the last 3 years, (started pretty young) I‚Äôve nodded out at family events, school, my job, spending time with friends. I don‚Äôt know how many times I‚Äôve been asked if I was ok, people could notice I was on kratom. I didn‚Äôt think I could lie to my friends and family for so many years, and even well, not technically essentially but essentially steal from them. Asking for money from my parents, friends, housemates, threw away my pride and dignity doing that. I even sold some of my possessions for money to buy it. Put my ex through hell when she saw me doing it, put my family through hell with them finally realizing I‚Äôm really addicted to this stuff. I‚Äôve lost so much of the time that I have left with the people I love in my life, I‚Äôve spent so much money on it, I‚Äôve dulled my potential for years, that‚Äôs the worst part is the time lost with loved ones that I was too out of it to interact with or want to see.

I‚Äôve only been off of it for about 30 hours, I‚Äôm not looking forward to these withdrawals, but I‚Äôm going to be really proud if I can get through it, apologize to a few people I wronged because of it, and go to my parents sober and tell them I‚Äôm sorry. Anyways, to anyone else quitting, in the process of withdrawals, I hope my story is relatable, or maybe even a warning of how deep it can get.

I currently am not experiencing any acute withdrawal symptoms.  Last night I slept over 10 hours.  No RLS, no insomnia, just some crazy nightmares.  

I went to the Dr. a week and a half ago.  They took my blood pressure and it was very high.  Stage 2 hypertension.  I admitted everything to him and broke down crying ashamed that I have gotten to this point.  He put me on a blood pressure medication called Losartan.  Started taking it and then forgot to take it on my quit day which was this past Thursday.  Went through withdrawals starting at about 3AM Fri morning.  They were pretty bad.  Monitored blood pressure and it was pretty normal.  I had suspected the kratom was the cause of the HBP as I eat ok, am relatively in shape, work outdoors, and am active.  People have said that Kratom lowers BP, but I have read in high doses it can raise it.  I was on 38 grams of capsules a day plus and OPMS shot.  Going to keep monitoring it.

Currently feeling OK.  I have been megadosing Vitamin C, and taking numerous supplements at bedtime to help with sleep.  Even went into work today.  Was a bit lethargic, but overall fine.  I did start taking L-tyrosene and L-theanine, but might not take the L-tyrosene anymore as I have had dizzy spells and rapid heart rate.  Apparently side effects of L-tyrosene.

1. I need something to hold me accountable.
2. I need your help and encouragement.
3. I want to document the process here with updates.

I read the guide about quitting cold turkey and am prepared for what I know is to come.  I quit smoking cigarettes CT as well 10 years ago and it wasn't as hard as one might think. Once you draw a line in the sand for yourself, it is just about enduring the mental pain in my opinion.

My challenges are these:

1. The kratom shop is next door to me, literally less than 500 feet.  
2. I actually use kratom for pain control for chronic nerve pain, but I then started to use it recreationally, and now I am at two extract shots a day.  (I was in a car accident in 2016 and was prescribed pain medicine for years.  Underwent surgery about 6 months ago and now the pain is to a point where I can leave the Kratom behind and manage with other means i.e. CBD, etc.)
3. This is, and I cannot this enough, the hands down biggest challenge for me; I have confided in no one about my kratom use, so I have no one to talk about quitting with.  I am embarrassed to admit out loud to another person that I am addicted to kratom.  This is a HUGE problem for me.  So please reddit community, help keep me honest.  I am open to chatting live with anyone.  Unfortunately the chat link in the subreddit didn't work for me, but would love to have a support sponsor of sorts if anyone has found this helpful.

2020-05-24 08:37:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/gpp0eo/feel_myself_again/,Feel myself again.," Last weekend I was damn near up to 200 grams daily I don't know how it got so bad honestly I was dieing more and more each day.I had head and eye wobbles and couldn't focus on anything my eyes that is. I have suffered a lot of losses over the past five years. My father died he was a life long drunk, my Stepfather died, my Aunt died and I spit up with my baby momma to name a few. I harbored so much guilt for so long I was basically afraid to kill myself to end my pain so I used the Kratom hoping it would take it for me. I believe I got an ulcer a month or two ago which made me feel the kratom a lot more. I  then started eating better and it seemed to go away but for some reason the same amount of Kratom suddenly did nothing I then started taking more to curb the withdrawals but was starting to get even worse. Last weekend I was dosing every few hours with around 40 grams at a time. I only got a couple hours of sleep at most each night. Sunday I was still in the same bad shape but exercised. Monday I had an epiphany or Devine intervention, I was at work withdrawaling but feeling endorphins rush through my body while working and exercising. I have a very physical job that keeps me in shape. I suddenly was able to see the beauty in the world again and feel like I am finding my purpose again. I couldn't help but smile and laugh even while withdrawling. I have not quit but am on my way the past two days I have tan 90 grams and am feeling way better so far. My energy is through the roof now and I am starting to take care of myself again which is honestly relieving me of some guilt surprisingly. Today I am going down to 80 grams and if I feel ok I  am going to try to drop down to 60 by the end of next or possibly before then.

That's me done for a year! Crazy how fast it has gone now. Although I wouldn't have said that in the first 2 weeks... That time truly sucked.

After the first month I was getting back to my old self with some incident of PAWS. Also codeine seemed to trigger it for some reason.

This lasted maybe 5 months at most. Since then I've been just me! And codeine didn't give me bad PAWS.

Everyone can do it. It's horrible but I managed it! I thought I would be back on it honestly.

I kinda have been switching up the strains but generally stick with greens as I'd liked the euphoric push a higher dose gave me. It just started to turn on me as of late as I mention further down.

So I just finished my second night of no Kratom just a few helpers such as multivitamins/Magnesium Glycinate and etizolam (sparingly and yes I know benzo addictions are hell so I've been dilligent not to develop any dependency to it). I took my last dose of kratom before bed on Thursday Night so my count may be a little off considering about 2 am was my last dose. I felt the stuff turning on me the last batch. I'd take my normal dose about 3 teaspoons each (7g x6-7) times a day up until bed time and even after dosing my legs would go straight to the WDs from morning dose until I kinda built up a  stack of doses throughout the day. Headshop kratom was always my go-to so who nows the actual quality but my last was ""Super Indo""

Day 1 was marked by horrible absolutely and I can't stress this enough the fucking WORST RLS type symptoms I've ever encountered from any other quit in the past. For the record I've been down this road 3 other times in the past and most were quite easy the other two were marked by nearly a month long drawn out process of dealing with RLS waking me up in the middle of the night which tapered down with time.. You guys know the feeling I trust; it feels like your every muscle from the thighs down is in a state of near constant spasming and tension. No other issues besides runny nose and sneezing but I tend to attribute that to seasonal allergies.  In retrospect maybe some chills but they never progressed further. Sleeping that night felt like my legs internally were rolling or something despite trying to remain still. Stretching did wonders....for a few minutes lol 

I did drink 2 tall cheap shitty beers \~8alc by volume over the night which did make the RLS worse prior to bed time. I made sure to guzzle down at least 5 12oz glasses of water to displace the alcohol and hopefully reduce the impending hangover.

Day 2 morning rls isn't half as bad as before. The rest of the day has been pleasant and I just feel maybe a little fatigued?

Day 3 or Night of day 2 I feel pretty much normal in every way. What gives I pretty much psyched myself up for the hell some of you guys have been through and I don't mean to sound like I""m gloating but I feel like I cheated this. Like I deserved the hellish sendoff to warn me away for good but my body (27yo) seems to have recovered 75% already. 

So anyone else have the same experience? 

Its worth noting I have a stupid crazy addictive personality and I don't even feel the need to buy more or something. I just feel like I prepared myself for hell and it was rather anticlimactic?  Stories here scared the bejeezus out of me going into this. I'm thankful for the support you guys have given so many others even if I may not need it just know you're good folks .",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4526109}"

I didn‚Äôt ever look into or let alone think of the long term health effects of the substance. In the past 6 months I‚Äôve developed constant gut issues e.g. swelling, sharp pains, and irritation. However the most debilitating of all my side effects (which I‚Äôve experienced for over a year) is that of feeling like I‚Äôm living on auto pilot. Like I‚Äôm not ever really present or ever taking in any particular important moment. With the constant brain fog I legitimately feel like I‚Äôm not living in reality. No ups no downs, nothing. 
After looking in to the side effects which correlated directly to mine and the terrible withdrawals I was dumbfounded and had a nearly complete mental breakdown. I thought this substance was healthy both mentally and physically, and completely safe to take for the long haul boy was I wrong... I never realized how it had such a hold on me or the fact that it played a large role in almost destroying my relationship. 
with that being said the past 3 weeks I have cut my dose down to 6 grams and have experienced some slight anxiety, increased heart rate, and depression. I am planning on making the jump in the next week and I‚Äôm curious about what herbs or substances or any recommendations in general will help with the short term and long term withdrawals from Kratom? And any advice on how I should continue my taper? 
I have phenibut which I use very occasionally, and klonopin occasionally as well, (both 3 or 4 times a month) but neither deal directly with dopamine and god knows what other of the 40 plus alkaloids. 
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

2020-05-23 22:22:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/gphou3/reality_setting_in/,Reality Setting In,"The past week I have struggled to quit.  One day was unbelieveably unbearable, I relapsed.  I felt generally like shit, my anxiety was insane, the RLS was kicking in and that weird energy that comes with RLS just made my body hurt.  I generally get that restless feeling in only my left leg and on the left side of my lower back.  It royally sucked, especially since I was at work.

I had some ambien for last weekend, but this weekend I don‚Äôt.  I think ambien kind of makes things worse tbh.  I think it‚Äôs good for maybe when you‚Äôre a week or 2 into it and haven‚Äôt slept in forever, but for the initial period, I feel like it prolongs the symptoms and makes things worse.  It‚Äôs like you need to suffer through it.  Your body is repairing.

I did one thing different this time around... I made sure to clean my apartment.  I spent last night washing dishes, cleaning up the kitchen, washing clothes, scrubbing the toilet, etc.  It really makes a difference, you feel much more comfortable in your surroundings.

The good news is I have the next 4 days off.  So, I will really get to rest and not worry about going to work.  Then I will just have to be back at work for 2 days and then I have another weekend.  Hopefully, by that next Monday I will he feeling somewhat better.  Realistically, I know it‚Äôs going to be 30 days before I‚Äôm well again and 45+ when I‚Äôm nearing baseline.  It‚Äôs a hard truth, but one I have to face.

I‚Äôve withdrawn so many times, it‚Äôs insane.  It‚Äôs been easy and nightmarish and a little between each time.  They are similar, but never exactly the same.  There is always one truth: reality setting in.

You start noticing little things.  The unique smell of your apartment may be noticed when you first walk into it, the cool weather feels much more pleasant, your mind begins to think and look at things differently, you start to analyze and look at situations much more differently.  You begin to wonder how you put yourself in this situation yet again.

I made some RSO capsules for the next few days using some indica strains with good medical properties.  RSO (for those that don‚Äôt know) is a cannabis oil that can be eaten.  It‚Äôs extremely potent and works very well for medicinal purposes.  It can help greatly with relaxing, stress and sleep.  It can be overwhelming at times, but it‚Äôs not bad.  If you live in a place where Marijuana is legal, I‚Äôd highly suggest it.  You can find it at dispensaries for $10-30.  I squeeze a little bit into a capsule (weighing it for dosage.). Typically one syringe has 500-900mg of THC along with other canabanoids.  I take it in doses of 50-100mg.  It can last a long time, so just be careful!  It‚Äôs extremely powerful.

I also picked up some nootropics that are supposed to help.  I‚Äôve taken phenibut before, so I‚Äôm giving that a 2nd go, it seems to be hit or miss.  I also grabbed some tianpentine.  I took it several hours ago and didn‚Äôt really feel a thing.  I took some phenibut about an hour ago and I can feel it ramping up.  Generally, they don‚Äôt do enough for the kind of pain I‚Äôm in, but sometimes it can take the edge off.

The worst part is the general discomfort.  You just don‚Äôt feel comfortable.  You don‚Äôt feel like doing anything.  Nothing is of interest.  You‚Äôre just kind of dead to the world, sitting there.  No matter what you do, you‚Äôre just sitting there in silent misery and it sucks so bad.  The worst part is when you‚Äôve been through it before and you know you‚Äôre looking at another 2 weeks of it followed by a few other weeks of beginning to improve.  It‚Äôs insane to think about how much a drug can throw your chemical balance off.

I can‚Äôt wait until it‚Äôs a few weeks from now and I‚Äôm no longer uncomfortable.  I‚Äôm laughing at movies, playing video games, laughing with my friends and I don‚Äôt have extreme anxiety.  I am so ready to get back to that point.  I need to figure out why I always end back up in this place.  I keep putting myself through this pain over and over again.

One of the hardest parts about this quit was the fact that kratom wasn‚Äôt even doing it for me anymore AND I still didn‚Äôt want to quit.  I felt like absolute shit all the time on it, but yet I kept taking it.  I forced myself to quit because I know I needed to...

Down to 0.25mg per day ideally. 

But to keep it short and sweet, I know how it feels to be in the midst of intense kratom withdrawals. Fight the urge because even the small doses set you back more than you think.

This is my experience and recommendations. I'm not perfect, but I have perfected my method at this point because I've experienced every avenue through both kratom and benzo addiction.

I thought I‚Äôd share just in case it helped someone.

Originally, I was taking 12 grams upon waking, then another 12 grams 8-9 hours later. On day one, instead of taking my normal dose I slowly sipped at kratom every few minutes until I felt normal. I only needed 4 grams. Then I‚Äôd front load my day with chores and activities and push myself as long as I could before taking my normal 12 gram dose in the afternoon, usually 8 or 9 hours later. That‚Äôs it.

I don‚Äôt know why, but my body is WAY more forgiving if I keep morning dosing minimal and stick to one main dose in the late afternoon. I‚Äôm going to proceed by cutting half a gram off my afternoon dose once every 5 days. Has anyone else tried something like this?

Normally I would have just taken big, frequent doses of kratom and mostly breezed through it...any one of us would.  I won't be doing that today.

Being played/ghosted by a girl in high school led me to use drugs for the first time, which led to harder stuff, which led to a depression/anxiety disorder, which led to antidepressants and a pornography/masturbation addiction, which led to mistakes/regrets due to the numbness antidepressants caused, eventually I started up street drugs again, got mixed up with the wrong crowd, had people stab me in the back, back to anti depressants, had lots of anger and resentment from that betrayal which caused bad insomnia, which is how I got hooked to Kratom and abused that for 6 years, it was the only thing that allowed me to sleep in a time where I was desperate to do so.

There is a pattern in the summary about me. I kept using crutches to fill emptiness or cover up my pain in hard times. Ultimately this continued to lead to more and more suffering.  I no longer take anti depressants, I no longer use drugs or drink. I no longer consume caffeine. I no longer seek out relationships because they always cause extreme highs followed by extreme lows.  

I have learned that dopamine is a dangerous thing. Kratom really depleted my dopamine levels, upon quitting I felt extremely lethargic and unmotivated, no desire to be alive. And I slowly but surely regained strength and happiness. I‚Äôve realized that everything I ever did was to chase dopamine. And the best way to give yourself that dopamine boost is exercise. As long as you‚Äôre careful not to injure yourself.  

Humans will naturally gravitate towards activities that give them pleasure by default. You have to remain mindful and practice self restraint in order to prevent yourself from going crazy with it or doing things that can be potentially destructive. I believe people who are past drug addicts are particularly susceptible to falling into this pattern. We‚Äôve ‚Äúgotten a taste‚Äù so to speak, we have to try extra hard not to go back to using stuff, someone that‚Äôs never used before doesn‚Äôt know that feeling.

The whole point of this post is to help people be more self aware and mindful. The reason why I am recommending exercise is because I believe everyone here is going to spend the majority of their day doing something that gives them pleasure, or helps them escape from reality. It‚Äôs so easy to just pick up another toxic pick me up, humans are creatures of habit and the things you practice today will become more and more engrained.  Exercise is one of the few activities that will give you that dopamine boost with the lowest risk of destroying you or sabotaging you in some way. I hope you all recover from this demon, don‚Äôt make the mistake of going back like people tend to do. Once you quit, stay clean.",21,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.63049835}"

I am a long time lurker and part time quitter, going CT today for the second time over quarantine from 10-20 GPD, the doses seemed to escalate with the free time. 

I have been a user for years and started daily dosing about two years ago. The final straw for me, aside from dependence, is how poor my memory has gotten. I can‚Äôt remember much of anything I studied while in school, names of acquaintances and professors, I am a half of the funny and sociable person I used to be. It‚Äôs like squeezing blood from a turnip. The cost of this has been work problems, small strains on my relationship, I want to start law school soon and keeping this flat affect is just not an option.

I am wondering how other quitters have experienced this type of thing, how has use/non use impacted your memory, learning ability, things like that. I was diagnosed with ADHD/dyslexia very early in life and was unmedicated through undergrad, aside from the heavy pre-class dose of maeng da that kept me productive, however shallow that productivity was. I just can‚Äôt take how stupid this drug makes me feel anymore. I am a prescribed man now, I have a good Androgen stack, I lift regularly, and I‚Äôm trying to meditate/pray to improve my focus. 

I would really appreciate stories from people in the same situation, there are plenty of resources for dealing with withdrawals and coming to terms with addiction, but I think the stories of other quitters strengthen my resolve the most.

Back then I entered a smoke shop and was advised to try it. For a year I was on and off buying 30g every week. After that first year i was up to 6g doses 3x a day. Then the next 2 years basically ended up around 7g 4x a day. I'm 21 (m) have tried to quit several times, the longest being a 5 day span. 

Yesterday was going to be the day but I completely fell back on dosing 7g twice through the day. So I threw it out and giving a serious shot... i know it's been a long time on a heavy dose, but I'm going to do my best to keep possitive and forget the habbit. 

My last dose was 16 hours ago and so far i do still feel possitive. My back is killing me and I slept 10hrs so I'm pretty groggy. On the plus side had some amazing dreams and I'm ready to actually do this.

I've kicked opiates in the past (2018), benzos (2019), and my 5th a day drinking habbit just 2 months ago. Stopped smoking pot at the start of the year so it's just gonna be me and my withdrawels.

I've been using kratom for over 2 years, almost daily. Like many I've seen here, it started as a once in a while thing, and ramped up over the past year to a multiple times a day thing. I take other supplements and treated it like one of those, never really thinking much of it until I didn't take any on a family trip. The first night I couldn't sleep, felt like I was jumping out of my skin. The following day I can only describe my state as mental anguish. 

Since then I've faced the harsh reality that I'm truly addicted to this substance and will experience w/d if I try to stop. Well, I have some health problems (hence the kratom in the first place) and have a procedure scheduled for June 15. I know I need to stop well before then. I had a surgery last year and was able to quit for several days beforehand, but began using kratom to manage the pain afterward vs. narcotics. I should have just taken the pills. Anyway, I'm doing this completely alone. I have two small kids - home right now due to the pandemic - and a husband. I'm their rock and I could never let them down. I see some people on here suggesting relying on a support system, going to AA, or getting meds from their dr. I don't feel like those are options I can explore. My family has no idea about this, they think kratom is just part of my regular supplement routine. I've lied all along. 

I know I don't have time for a slow taper. But this is also not a great time for me to have full-on w/d (not that there's ever a good time, but right now I'm working, homeschooling, and parenting around the clock). I know everyone has to do this their own way, in the way that works for them. Right now I take two tbsp in the morning, and 3 in the evening. I am attempting to cut out my morning dose every other day (the days I can attempt more self care). I'm a few days into that and it's not so bad. I have cravings, of course, but no physical or emotional symptoms. I'm hoping to cut out that first dose and then in a week or so move on to tapering off my night-time dose. I guess my thought process is that if I am getting my body used to less, once I stop taking it at night it won't be so hellish? Like I'm reducing my addiction before I try to just stop it? No idea if there's any science behind that. 

I have some of the supplements suggested here (DPLA, Valerian Root). Sleep is my biggest hurdle. I've always been a big sleeper and I know everything will tank quickly if I can't sleep. Days I can get through, nights are another story. 

Ultimately, I know I just have to do this, and the surgery in a few weeks presents the right wake up call. When I have gone through hard things in the past I've told myself ""What one man can do, another can do."" I know people do much harder than this every day and my body is capable of it. Since I have no one to talk to about this, I am hoping someone in this group can provide some support. Is my plan realistic? What else should I consider? When I feel down I keep telling myself it's not real. It's my body playing tricks on me. My life is great and full and wonderful. The depression I feel when quitting is temporary, but feels so real. Any advice or support would be so welcome now. I wake up every morning anxious and scared that I can't do this.",6,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5828238}"

Took 100mg 5-HTP (this time without GABA) later in the evening and it made me tired but I couldn't sleep very well.

I do have some phenibut left from my nootropic experiments a while ago - this usually did nothing to me, I only became very sleepy/ dizzy. Maybe I should try this?

No matter what stage you are in, actively using, 2 hours clean, 2 years, whatever, shame can sneak in and completely take over. I think we as addicts heap on those extra helpings of shame at every possible chance. 

I found myself completely engulfed in shame today. I've lost count of how many times I've quit, I recently got 21 days, but the nihilism and the shame crept in. I kept getting so mad at myself for having cravings, calling myself weak, flawed, pathetic. Things that I don't feel about any other addict but myself. 

I slipped and the shame is what has kept me using for a whole week. Telling myself I'm an idiot, a lost cause, all of these things that push me back into the welcoming arms of my addiction.

I am just wanting to hear from you about how Kratom at first started out euphoric and made you feel incredible, and then somewhere down the line you found yourself buried in depression, no enjoyment of the things you used to love, no motivation, feeling soulless and lacking empathy. Just living your days in a state of irritation and ugliness. And not realizing Kratom caused it until you came off. I am going to share these stories with someone who struggles believing Kratom can cause you to be a completely different person and how coming off you can actually do a 180 and return to life again and feel human, and feel emotions on a different level. How you feel connected to humanity again.

I feel very proud of myself. Kratom was an inexpensive, relatively safe and discreet addiction that plagued me for > 4 years. I ordered my kilos from a reputable snake oil peddler in Indonesia and it was all good, until it was not. I did not suffer physical or mental health issues from Kratom but I started noticing how truly dull I had become. I went on an epic hike last fall that should have brought tears of joy to my eyes but nope, I was chronically numb and unable to tap into those emotions. I had a hole in my soul for sure.

1. What do you want for your future self, who could be completely free from kratom 3 months from now?
2. What will you gain from a relapse? What will you lose?
3. If you had to live this life over again, which parts would you want to revisit?
4. If you only have a limited time on this earth, how do you want to spend it?  Stuck in a cycle that makes you miserable, or being present to experience true joy and pain? 
5. What do you miss about your old self before you were addicted? Do you want that part of you back?
6. Do you enjoy being addicted?
7. Why did you decide to quit?
8. Do you ultimately want to quit? You should only choose to relapse (it is a choice) if the answer to this question is no. Otherwise, there are no circumstances that justify a relapse after quitting.

The only supplement you absolutely need before anything else is magnesium. *It is a critically foundational mineral in the body responsible for more than you can easily comprehend, and if you‚Äôre reading this, you are magnesium deficient.*
Not all forms are equal. Do the best you can, but magnesium bicarbonate liquid form is the best form (closest to the natural form present in water, but it isn‚Äôt in the water supply anymore because of things like acid rain, NPK fertilizer, and the industrial revolution) This is one of the reasons why Everyone is deficient. 
Bicarbonate will give you the best possible results and here are some benefits it provided me: helps mood, helps achieve more focus and productivity, eases anxiety, depression, insomnia, and quality of sleep. It is the only necessary supplement and one that I could definitively ‚Äúfeel‚Äù out of all of the stuff I bought to get through WD. You can purchase from amazon from pristinehydro. You can also do it a much more inexpensive way by either using any sparkling water (preferably not distilled) and adding magnesium hydroxide or pristine hydro electrolyte balance powder. I personally use a soda maker so I can use cleaner water. Replace your kratom habit with a magnesium bicarbonate habit, and your body will not punish or disappoint you. *careful not do to much, could cause side effects, primarily loose stool. Experiment with you sweet spot as far as dosage.*

* in my opinion, distracting yourself is the most important thing by far - the worst parts of the first four days were when I was up at night researching ""treatments"" (supplements) on this subreddit a nd the best were talking and laughing with family
* At first, i was super emotional and wanted to quit drinking casuallly and rediscover jesus. As soon as i dropped this bullshit it was a lot easier to feel better and normal like myself.
*  the withdrawal was most intense weeks before when i attempted to taper - you are causing yourself undue agony by tapering. You will end up becoming more addicted as your brain recognizes taking it solves the problem. **you must** remove the option of taking it from your life entirely.

I was using kratom for productivity and motivation. The great news guys is despite removing it I have the same exact motivtaions and work productivity - but no crazy mood swings, getting too dizzy to walk, or having to think about some green sludge.

2020-05-19 21:45:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/gn281v/what_a_fool_i_was/,What a fool I was.,"My kratom journey started about 1 and a half year ago. 

I just got applied to a fashion school, but  honestly, I could not care less. 90% of the reason I applied in the first place was because I had no energy, nor will, to find a job.
My ex girlfriend and I had just broken up because she slept with a friend of mine. 1 of my 2 only true friends moved away from the city we were living in. I also lost my job to the friend who slept with my ex (quite a funny coincidence). I felt alone, sad and miserable.

The first school day came and due to being constantly nervous all the time my long time IBS stomach problem got even worse. The only thing that kept me going was the free money I would get from studying(school system we got here in Sweden, you basically get paid to study).

After about a month the money came and I bought my first bag of kratom. I don‚Äôt remember why I bought it, but I needed some kind of solution. The bag came and I decided to take it the following night, when my family was asleep. I went down, boiled some water and added a spoonful of kratom into it. I drank it slowly incase I‚Äôve dosed too much. After a while the effects were coming. This was a new feeling for me. My thoughts were so clear, my body was relaxed and best of all, my IBS were completely gone.

The next day I decided to take some kratom before school. What could go wrong? And indeed, nothing went wrong. That day was a day of complete happiness. No nervousity, no IBS, no depression. I have never felt that way since I was a little kid. A weird, nostalgic feeling of being entertained by anything anyone ever told. Everything felt like a new experience. Talking to strangers or learning something new. It did not matter, life felt exciting again.

I continued using kratom every morning and the months quickly passed by. But a new problem came up. Usually around the time I got home from school, I felt like my old depressed self again, but even worse. I also had trouble sleeping during nights and would often wake up drenched in sweat. So I figured out that if I took another dose of kratom when I got home from school my mood and sleeping problems would go away. Easy fix to a hard problem.

Even more time went by and now we are close to the current date. Covid-19 came and school announced they will be closed until the situation looks better. I am now dosing about 4-5 times a day. I don‚Äôt feel many effects at all. After dosing I feel normal, with a slight increase of enjoyment of doing nothing at all. Laying in bed, watching movies whole day felt good. What else would I do? The school is closed and I got nothing else to do. Better wait until Covid-19 is over.

My dad and I went on a long hiking trip some weeks ago. I was still using kratom but I was feeling depressed all the time. Maybe this trip would help. We were walking for 2 days straight and slept in a tent during the night. I was a bit nervous the day before the trip but packing a water bottle full of kratom made me feel a lot better. But although I had my bottle of kratom I was sweating a LOT. Not normal sweat, but sweat that drenched my whole body. The night came, we put up our tent and were going to sleep. But I could not fall asleep. Even though I was high on kratom I was freezing like never before and was completely wet after sweating like a pig during the whole day. That was it, I had to quit using kratom.

As I‚Äôm writing this, I‚Äôm on day 10, completely free of the green slug. I have a strange feeling of open mindness and have never ever felt this sensitive. Music affects me in a new way and my emotions are all over. But I like it. I like feeling sad, happy or feeling any emotion at all to be honest. I have been comfortably numb(great song) for a year and a half now. I‚Äôm currently studying for my driver‚Äôs license and looking for a job for the summer. It is hard while quitting kratom, but I feel like I need to start the rest of my life right now.

What I learnt from taking kratom: True happiness is not achieved by swallowing a bad tasting green powder. What made me continue taking it was the thought that if something made me feel good, how could it possibly be harmful to me? What a stupid thought... During this quit I have sometimes felt like shit but that proved to me how harmful it must be for my body. Why else would I feel this bad without it?

At the worst, I had a horrible uei use until I was able to finally taper over to plain leaf. For a few years I ingested over 16 tablespoons a day of plain. 
I started to unconsciously taper again after I realized I was still having painful w/d even at only 8 tablespoons a day. I have very little tolerance to the RLS that I get in my arms.
I've had to go extremely slow. I'm finally down to 2 teaspoons a day. One in a.m. and one at 6 p.m. I cannot believe I am almost done. I will take another week to lesson each dose until its done. 
I am grateful to kratum cause it helped to stop my opioid issue, I didn't die, OD or wind up in jail. But I am sad I spent so much money and energy on it. 
My advice...take a slow taper if possible. There is no reason to w/d if you don't have to. My strong advice is to never try the uei or other enhanced versions. Do not fool yourself into thinking its a ""treat"". I believe they are tainted although I couldn't prove it.

""It's just so terrible there is no replacement for feeling good chemically. I remember sitting on the roof with my stoner friend. We were both high on dxm and weed, feeling like angels. I asked him ""Do you think there is any way to feel like this in normal life?"" He said ""No. That's why we take drugs.""

You hear people talk about how great sober life is but I was there. It's just all your old problems without a break. Some people can carve out a piece of the cake for themselves, or it was given to them, but some of us just get filtered through to the bottom of the world. If I don't have getting high then do I have anything? I run as much as I can. People say that's something to do instead of drugs. It's great sure but it's not a couple of percs, good tunes and a cozy chair. If you take that away I'm going to go looking for it in something else.

Ram dass said the thing about happiness is nothing is ever the giant icecream cone in the sky. Eventually you get to the bottom of it or you have to much and feel nasty and bloated. You can't just keep licking away and be happy forever. I guess it helps if you find meaning somewhere else but again that's a luxury for people great enough to make a difference.""

My reply:

Wow, I think you just hit the nail on the head of modern mans, or just mans, problem. Meaning is everything. Everything. Without it to justify and make worth the pain and suffering of Being we become nihilistic, apathetic, and filled with rage, depression, and psychosis, over the injustice and unfairness of it all. It's madness the situation we find ourselves in and drugs are the coping mechanism we use to shut those feelings of insanity down. Russell Brand in his book on addiction says that maybe addicts are people who are especially sensitive to the lack of true meaning provided by the culture and so we frantically search for it; and those of us unfortunate enough to come across drugs get sucked deeply into the temporary cessation of that impulse to search. But it's not sustainable. And we find ourselves where we are now, desperate to fill that void left by the absence of meaning, but the old ways of filling it not working anymore... And so we're faced with a choice few have to make in the way we do: continue what we've been doing, which, be honest, is choosing a slow torturous suicide, or, as Jordan Perterson would say, ""pick up your damn burden and [fucking] carry it."" It's brutal. It's being stuck between the densest rock and the hardest hard place. And it tears you apart. But you're already torn apart, you're already, in a way, broken. There's nothing to lose. Afraid of the pain? Well you're already in pain! There's really only two options, choose death, and pray to whatever higher consciousness you subscribe to that death is a cessation of suffering, or choose life and carry the burden of your pain.",32,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5421643}"

Bigger than usual. I've had addiction issues on and off for like 4 years now with kratom. Well, I went off kratom for about 3 months and was finally starting to feel better.

Then that temptation started creeping up on me and I've had a few relapses. I just had my second seizure in the last 2 months and while the first time kratom was in my system, I simply chalked it up to lack of sleep and abusing alcohol.

This time, only kratom was in my body. I took a dose around 8g (slowly worked up to that dose as my tolerance has been rising this relapse).

Needless to say, it was not pleasant. It was a major tonic clonic seizure. Scared my family half to death and now I owe like $7000 in hospital bills combined after last time and now this time.

Kratom has literally stolen probably $10,000 from me and who knows how much time and potential. It is a net negative to my life. Everyone says I'm so much more friendly and alive when not on it. I have literally no good reason to keep taking it. And now I can't even legally drive for 6 months without clearance from a neurologist. It's stolen my ability to drive too.

I've obviously stopped taking it completely now and am on some anti-seizure medication.

Wish me luck. I fully intend to make this the last relapse. Forever.",17,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.85994744}"

Just a quick refresher, I took kratom for 4 years with no real breaks and at my worst was at 30+ gpd. I started a long taper sometime I think in February and was finally able to get off the stuff after previous attempts. 

The acutes were drastically minimized from my taper, but it has still been a journey with lots of ups and downs since I quit. With that being said, I feel like I am doing really well and have had no desire to go back and essentially no cravings. I think the slow prolonged discomfort and discipline from tapering really helped me in not wanting to go back. However, I have had many bouts of restlessness and anxiety, especially in the first couple weeks, but it gets a little better every day. I have been having consistently more and more ‚Äúgood‚Äù days in a row and even when I do have off days, they pale in comparison to how shitty I felt in the throes of my kratom addiction. 

My overall sense of well being is better than it has been in a very long time. Ive started to get obsessed with guitar and writing music again, something I hadn‚Äôt cared about in years. I have also reached out to many of my close friends that I hadn‚Äôt talked to in a long time and mended relationships.  Now we talk on a day to day basis and it feels great to have them in my life again. I don‚Äôt feel like I am 100% back to baseline yet, but I feel so much more ‚Äúme‚Äù than I have in years. 

I just want to thank this community again for being such a valuable resource for recovery. I really don‚Äôt know if I would have been able to do this without the support from people here and just being able to share my experience with people that can relate. If anyone needs some support or advice please feel free to reach out to me and I will do my best to help. If you are struggling with kratom addiction, please lean on this community and know that you CAN beat it.

In my emotional state  ive been looking at pictures of 2 friends and coworkers of mine...both family men...who died by overdose in the past. It makes me sad but also gives me strength to continue to fight. I know relief is coming...maybe today is just the cumulative affect of 5 nights of little sleep but today is bad.

Its my first time really admitting to myself or anybody else I have a problem. I've hidden my use so well and kept up a normal life nobody ever became the wiser, not my boyfriend (current), parents, brother, nobody. 

But wow I'm finally ready to say I'm addicted! I got addicted to Kratom. I got addicted because I couldnt stand myself. 

When I used to have small moments of clarity I'd always be too ashamed to accept the thought of addiction. I had some fucked up traumatic shit happen to me when I was 19 and I never reached out for help. I just coped with green sludge and marijuana. 

So now I'm 24 [f] and in really bad shape from it.[I'd tossed and washed for 3 years then switched to tea just about 3 months ago when the symptoms really started getting bad]

 I've just recently been to the doctor for severe abdominal pain/swelling, ulcer like symptoms, loss of appetite, vomiting, and EXTREME fatigue. I havent eaten a solid meal in nearly two weeks. But expecting the test results back today actually, the doctor suspected liver, pancreas or gallbladder problems.

I'd been wanting so badly to be rid of this addiction even before I started getting sick. So I started, I've been tappering with tea as I feel quitting CT would really throw me in a spiral and I wouldn't be able to tell what symptoms were withdrawal or what symptoms were the possible liver/pancreas/gallbladder issues. But once I get a diagnosis I would like to immediately push for a CT. 

I dont like the road I'm on. I'm not afraid to say I messed up and thought I could handle my mental trauma on my own and let it get out of hand. This doesnt have to be my life and I'm going to stop. Theres no other option. I joined this sub for the community and hoping with nobody else to talk to about this I could get through this addiction with you guys if you'll let me. 

Thanks for listening, I'd love to hear other similar stories.

TEST UPDATE: Liver enzymes came back way higher than normal so I'll be going back for more tests.

My best advice for **quickly** dealing with PAWS is a cold shower. It sucks balls but so does laying there in misery. The trick is to get out of your own head. Yes, I do also recommend other techniques such as meditation and exercise. However, these activities take much more time and work to accomplish to receive the effects of what cold water can do. 

I take multiple cold showers a day. Basically anytime PAWS become too much to deal with. However, the most effective time for me to take a cold shower is at bed time. Do you remember snuggling in bed on a cold snowy day when your parents refuse to turn the heat up/on? Well get ready! You'll get this feeling immediately after drying off and crawling to bed. You'll suddenly be taken away from the debilitating effects of PAWS, at least for a little while. This can be just enough of a distraction to get some work done or possibly, god willing... fall asleep. 

Tips for cold showers:

* Start with hot water
* While hot water is running lather up hair and body with soap
* Make a commitment to wash off completely while cold water is running (this helps by having a goal rather than just forcing yourself to be cold af for an unknown amount of time)
* After washing off soap, switch to hot water
* Wash and rinse face
* Switch to cold water and rinse off again 
* Turn water off and dry off quickly
* Run and jump into bed and ENJOY yourself for a few minutes :)

I would listen to music for hours while the whole time I had to move my body on the music and lip syncing with the lyrics. I had long conversations over text, I also started texting random people and enjoyed it tremendously, like really abnormally so. Normally I only text when nessecary and only to get things done. My friends also noticed and have said that I was more energetic and more goofing around then before.  
And now again. I'm in my room at night. It's 02:09 now where I live. And can't get enough of this song that is now on repeat for atleast one and a half hour, half dancing in my chair and lip syncing.

I took the plunge last saturday, so 8 days ago. I was using 30-100g a day for the last 2 years. Actually id say i was using 10g a day for the first year, then this last year has spiraled out of control. A local shop opened up a Kratom powder store that sells only kratom. They have every strain under the sun. Then i found a gas station that sold extract pills for super cheap. Pills always hit me way harder. Id have to drink a good amount of powder to feel it compared to the pills.

Anyways, ive been to drug rehab 3x before for shooting speedballs and smoking crack. I shot speedballs for a good solid year and messed my veins up pretty bad so i gave up the needle and went to the pipe. I eventually got clean and was clean for years. I found out about kratom as a super coffee that has pain killing effects. It reeled me in because i have a lot of body aches from serving in the airborne infantry. 

That leads me to now. I have 8 days under my belt and the withdrawl symptoms are getting worse as the days pass. The first couple days werent that bad for me. The normal feeling down and body aches. But i was sleeping fine, had energy, and all was well. I feel like i got hit by a train today. No appetite, no energy, it feels like every cell in my body is firing and aching. Doing the littlest task takes enormous amounts of energy to complete. 

I work in a factory and have had to wear a mask the last 2 weeks. Add in the warmth of the place, its a recipe for disaster right now. I also work a lot, i usually work a lot of overtime, and im clueless how im going to muster up enough energy to even work 8 hours.
 
Gyms are closed down but i am an avid distance runner. I regularly bust out 10-15 mile runs no problem. The last 2 days all ive been able to do is 3 miles each time...todays 3 miles felt like 100.

I read about detox tea on here...i bought some with some ginger kombucha. Ive been taking vitamins. 

I am at the point where id do anything to feel better because it seems like i feel worse by the hour. Last night was my first night of RLS and little sleep...even taking trazadone. I had to take a good amount of hydroxizine to get 4.5 hours of sleep.

I hopped back on the train within a few days after I couldn't fall asleep due to the pain, and it made the pain pretty negligible in combination with OTC painkillers.

the pain has been better recently (with or without the green slime), but I calculated how much I was using about a month ago and found i was using like 14g a day. had no idea i was using that much, and cut down to about 6gs a day for the last month up until 10ish days ago.

spent about $150 on a kilo 2 weeks ago when i was running very low, the biggest order of my life. wasn't planning on using it as much as before, but certainly wasn't planning on quitting. 

the online tracking number said it shipped last week but i checked an hour after it was reported and there was nothing. talked to a neighbour and apparently package theft has been a problem over the past few months. delivery service hasn't found any problems with the delivery, and my shitty landlord has cameras in the post area that don't work at all.

this is usually the point at which i hit up a local head shop for some overpriced kratom, but I'm not sure what i'm gonna be doing now. I don't have much money to spend on this stuff, but I'm pretty miserable right now. the shakes are gone, but I don't feel like doing anything. don't really feel much better. just hornier and hungrier, honestly. 

shit is really up and down, but almost always down. i work a shitty job now, and now I don't enjoy doing the things I used to love to do during my free time when i was doing them on the slime. it seems like a pretty good time to go back on the wagon. i know i should stay away, but i miss it.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.58364993}"

short report.. remember we are all different.. after only 8 months usage.. stopped 11/2019 by CT and adventure begins..

**first month (1 to 30 day):** anxiety, panic attack in combination with diarhea, no dopamine, no testosterone, no serotonin (5-HT).

**second month (30 - 60 day):** lot of supplements, self medicated.. physical symptoms subsided.. mental symptoms groving up. there is no good or bad days, there is better or very bad hours. Social phobia builded by my mind was new for me. Lack of dopamine - nothing what you can enjoy. Revard system not working. No dopamine, No TS, no 5-HT. No sleep. 

**third month (60 - 90 day):** Better .. one and half week .. ""I feel lot off better.. I can say.. normaly again.. wow"".. but it is not the end. Mood swings begins. Now it is about 24 hours bad, 12 hours manageable. This cycle is very accurate. It lasted between 80 - 111 day. Bad days was very very slightly mitigated. Sleep was better.

**fourth month (90 -120 day) :** Mod swings are there.. The cycle is simple.. no dopamine (I feel RLS) / some dopamine, very very very small dopamine / some more dopamine.. brain is healing.. produce small /  produce litle more than small.. Each person react on it different.. Panic attacks hit me in combination with internal restlessness. It depends on you life beforem. Sometime is very hard to enjoy anytning. Sometimes it is better and you feel normal life. Sleep is back.

**fifth month (120 - 150 day):** The end of all restlessness. 2 days good / half day bad. Bad means lack of dopamine.. cant feel joy.. but can work! Social phobia is over. Reward system is broken.. bud there are nice days! Enjoy every good minute and prepare to fight again! Sleep is normal.

**sixth month (150 - 180 days):** Days are good 3-6 in a row.. bads are there.. bad feeling mitigated after some hours. I Can work, I can play games on Steam, I restored some friendships.. Dopamine system is better and better. 

**Today (day 184):** I am back. Dopamine system is working again. Set the goal, do it.. and you get rewards. Enjoyment is back. Creative work, Games, Sex, Movies, Music.. I like it again!!! Have some bad hours, but it is manageable. I have new pottery wheel for creativity with clay. Trying to be more social. I started biking more, excercising, walking in nature.

**My rules and conviction**

1) do not supplement danger things. Brain needs produce own dopamine and serotonin. If you get it form external source, brain can't repair reward system.

2) drink lot off water, try to sleep, eat well and excercise

3) when you can sleep.. try to sleep in regular mode... go to sleep 10pm and wake on 6 am.. your brain heal process will be faster! Sleep is the key! Key for better life also after Kratom.

**Conclusion**

I am not the same. I am better. And adventure continues... without Kratom!

So I continued my plan and naltrexone my ass right away. Fuck you craving you ain't got shit on me. Now even if I wanted to in the worst way taking kratom wont do shit for 48 hours. Funny cravings go right away when you take naltrexone. It's crazy how mental it is. Once the brain knows you cant use voila it's gone lol. Our brains really are working against us. Feel better now knowing I survived one of the strongest urges I've had post quit. I really think naltrexone is under valued in the addiction community.

Today has been all over the place.  I've been feeling all sorts of feelings from very happy, to active to tired to depressed to anxiety.  It's like my emotional switch has been flipped on.  It's extremely overwhelming.  I feel like I have been without emotions since taking kratom again.  It was like a drip when I was taken, not it's like a faucet that will not stop.  It feels both amazing, terrifying and painful.

I've been feeling rather hot and I've started developing a headache. My appetite is OK.

I haven't smoked yet, but I do plan on smoking here soon.  That usually helps put things in perspective.  I usually have a big high and then when I come down it makes me feel much better and I ride that for an hour or 2.

I keep feeling all the emotions I haven't felt in so long.  It is stressful. There have been times I wanted to cry or just want to break down.  I don't know how, so I just suffer through it.

I've been watching TV and movies to get me through it.  They have a big impact on how I'm feeling and the emotions.

If anyone has any movie or TV suggestion, please share.  I am currently watching Ozark.

Eyes still water a little for about 30 mins a day and it's not that bad.  Otherwise feel good.  No nausea, very little fatigue.  So far so good, after day 5 I will discontinue the cymbalta completely.  Cymbalta gives no high feeling whatsoever.   Completely clear headed and bright eyed.  Oddly enough sex drive went up after I quit almost immediately.  Btw, I've been on and off kratom for 4 yrs straight.  40 Gpd.  I would almost recommend this more than quitting with gabapentin which I've done before.  Well hope this helps ..cymbalta is highly prescribed by doctors for everything from nerve pain, joint pain, depression, anxiety,etc.etc. so it's easy to acquire especially because it's much harder to get addicted to cymbalta vs. Opiates and such.  Mostly a mental addiction if your diagnosed with depression.

It‚Äôs been a rough couple of weeks.,"So i had been tapering for a long time, i was up anywhere from 30-40g daily and i tapered down to 4g a day over the course of about 6 months. Once i got down to about 10g a day this was when i really started to see my personality come back. When i got to 4g a day i had absolutely no withdrawals or at least not really noticeable if i didn‚Äôt dose for a long time. I was really loving life, although my sleep was struggling a tad i knew it would get better. Fast forward a ways and i made the stupid decision of taking oxy again and it totally screwed up my life. 

Everything that i worked so hard for fell apart. Luckily i had my parents to help me out financially. Kratom was what got me clean in the first place, and it gave me a life which i am thankful for. But now i just went through the most horrible oxy withdrawal, and to cope i was taking 50-60g a day. 

Like i said, everything that i worked so hard for fell apart. My kratom taper, my finances, my gym progress, my social life. It was one of the most heartbreaking things i‚Äôve experienced to see it all fall apart. After i got clean a few weeks ago off oxy, i was the most depressed i‚Äôd ever been for about a week and a half. I‚Äôve now pretty much come into acceptance with it all, i had to let my ego go, it was not easy. 

Now i have been taking 24g a day for the past few days, and i am going to do another taper, i‚Äôm going to be patient. I‚Äôm dropping 2-4g every week. But if i am not sleeping on my current dose i am going to stay on it until it stabilizes. It sucks starting over but i‚Äôve learned this time. Do not use other drugs while tapering. If you drink don‚Äôt drink more than 2 drinks. Because you will have rebound anxiety and you will not sleep which will make you want to take more kratom.

Also, exercise really is key to getting your brain to start feeling right again. I started super slow but I am now up to 3-4 miles 5 times a week.

Normally, I would just have a drink or a cigarette but I‚Äôm pregnant so I‚Äôm left to confront the void. This is probably the best chance that I‚Äôll ever have at facing the root of this demon. 

I want to know, to those who have made steps - what changes have you made in your thinking or in your routines that have helped you make it through the rough patches?

Before opioids and then Kratom I was always self aware, in tune with people and their energies. My intuition was almost always on point. Insert opioids and then the past 3.5 years of Kratom and I LOST MYSELF!! I  became an overreacting soulless zombie with no ambition or drive. I am an adventurous person by nature, always outside searching for the next beautiful sight and I would derive an actual high from the beauty. The earth energized me. But after about a year and a half in on Kratom I lost it all. I didn't care about hiking or snowboarding (which I always do every weekend during season) I didn't really have emotions except depression and irritability. The man I love more then anything I constantly felt at odds with. I pretty much stopped fighting with my teenage daughter and let her stay at friends houses on school nights, overlooked the fact she vapes (which I hate!!) all because I just didn't want to deal with the drama. But now, I feel again. I am alive!! I thought somehow I completely lost who I am and the joy I always carried with me. But now I know that Kratom put me in a coma and robbed me of my essence. But I am back and better than ever! This journey started 3 weeks ago due to a painful moment, but I have rediscovered so much about myself and my situation and I have total faith that everything is working out and will be better than ever. I FEEL again!! I kept reading people talk about how music was different.. And IT REALLY IS! I can feel music again and I am in control of my thoughts more and not so reactive.

Day 4 I was discouraged because sleep was still not forthcoming. The general fatigue and fog was making work truly miserable, and causing anxiety by my perceived lack of performance. Day 6 was the first day I felt like I had a little bit more control back. Not all of it, but enough to give a bit of hope. Day 7 was manageable. Amazing how good 4 hours of sleep feels when you've maybe had 3 hours over 5 days. I wouldn't say I feel good, but their is some hope now. I'm glad I forced my way through it. I'm glad I didn't lose my family, friends, job, and life over this opioid masquerading as super coffee. I listened to music today instead of the news today, that helped my outlook a bit too I think.

I want to do a slow taper, but I mapped it out and I would not have enough kratom to do that starting at my current daily amount.

I can live through the physical symptoms of w/d, but I‚Äôm prone to very severe depression and 2-4 months of PAWS would be straight up dangerous for me.

I will say that this is not my first rodeo with trying to quit but something is definitely different this time. Before, I didn't really want to quit. Now, there's something inside of me that so strongly wants to be done with it. It served a purpose in my life and help me for 2 years. It helped me get off opiates. So here comes my question. I've got a lot of gabapentin and when I take it at a kind of high dose, it almost virtually takes away the kratom withdrawal. I'm going to use the gabapentin to quit. But at the same time I need gabapentin and I don't want to go through all of my script and run out early.I up my dose just a little bit and it helps me through the withdrawal symptoms. I only want to do this for a few days so I don't run out of my script. I will take a smaller dose for a few days ( which is fine)  since I am taking a higher dose to get me through the kratom withdrawal. Does that make sense?

 So my question is, how many days do you think that I need to use the higher dose of gabapentin to get through the physical effects of kratom withdrawal? I know that the emotional stuff is going to follow but I'm talking about the nausea and hot flashes, all those nasty physical symptoms. When I up my dose of gabapentin I do not get these symptoms except for a little bit of sweating. Not using the gabapentin or comfort meds to aid me through it is just not an option. Once that physical stuff starts and I get so uncomfortable, I will use. I know I'm a baby, but I just know me. I'm going to have to use the comfort meds I have access to which is gabapentin as well as vistaril to get me through this so I can stay somewhat comfortable. What do you think, 3 days of using comfort meds? 5? Thanks!

Posting to say thanks, and provide light.
I used kratom for 4 years, mostly daily, with a handful of brief breaks.  At the end I was up to 15 gpd without a break for almost 2 years.
Like many, I didn't know about the addictive qualities, until I started waking up feeling like shit.  
I suspected, then confirmed it was the small, 2x daily doses I was taking, and that I had built up a tolerance.  That led to my first quit, which I thought was tough.  Little did I know...
Like many, I whipped that first wd, and then went back to a very productive and lengthy period of using 2-3 times per week, until I popped a hamstring doing sprints.  Tramadol + kratom = faster addiction, FYI. 
That was another tough break in the daily.
Then, in January 2018, at my peak physical fitness (46yo male, btw), I went into daily use with abandon. I broke my rule of no more than 2x a day.  I bargained with myself and made excuses.  
Fast forward to 6 weeks ago.  
Something had obviously changed.  I didn't sleep well.  I woke everyday in wd like that first time, but worse. I didn't have much interest in my work or being social.  My workouts slowly deteriorated.  Pretty sure my testosterone tanked.  I still had sex all the time, but I also worked out daily, and had a gf 15 years younger than me.  But muscles plateaued, runs slowed.  Hair was thinner and off some of my calves.  
And then I get 5 days off in a row, didn't think, didn't plan, just jumped.  
Day 2 was exquisitely painful on physical and mental levels.  I was afraid I lost who I am, had no confidence, was scared as hell.  
Went back to work on day 6.  
I'm in healthcare, work 12 shifts, physically active the whole shift.  Nothing like performing cpr first thing at 6:45 in the morning to show ya how you're gonna handle work.  It sux, and you're thankful at the same time, cause you know you can do it.  
Fast forward again to today.  There have been cravings, breaking the habit mostly.  There are moments where I know I can indulge again, but never want to do anything that would lead back to the hell I just went through.  
I'm not fully back to being me.
But I'm close, and way better than I was on the shit.
And I don't knock it, the leaf.  I realized a lot of benefits from it, and some of those I've kept.  
Anyway, this forum was most helpful.  
Just wanted to give something back.
You can do it, you do get through it, it does get better, it is so worth it.
One more thing.  I quit with about 500 grams in the house.  I didn't throw it away until the acutes were over.  
I stared at those baggies with pure hatred while I was feeling my worst.  I said to myself, there's nothing no one can do to make me take another spoonful of that shit again. I got angry.  Whatever fight you got in you.  Whatever pissed offedness you can muster, use it.  And work out, even if it makes you cry.  And eat fruits and veggies and green tea and super dark 80% cocoa.

2020-05-15 12:27:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/gkcbuc/quitting_taper_advice/,Quitting - taper advice?,"Hey all!

I'll try to keep this brief and I'll preface by saying this isn't my first rodeo. I'm 33 years old and have been through a few addictions in my younger days (I won't name the substances - one was fairly 'hard' while the others I'd consider moderate). Also, I fully acknowledge no advice on reddit can be considered proper medical advice. Still, I value your opinions. I've stalked this reddit from time to time and even posted a few times before - this is a good community.

I've been taking kratom for (I think) about 3 years now. I started it because I believed it would be beneficial to me in low, infrequent doses. That went south - I began taking it daily and my doses became larger and more frequent. I didn't notice any negative effects, so never thought much of it. The energy was ""benefiting"" me, I thought. In more recent months, I have felt really bad. Mentally and emotionally unstable, nauseous a lot of the time, ridiculous sleep schedule where I'd go to bed early and wake up in the middle of the night and take more kratom. I'm not entirely sure but I believe my daily intake was anywhere between 20-35 grams, with some doses being around 10 grams.

The pandemic hit. I'm the (2nd) manager of a small resort in NYS and we shut it down just before the State went on pause. I'm fortunate to be salaried and was able to continue working, but with no guests in camp and virtually no calls or e-mails coming through, I had more time for introspection. Everything was going to hell, including my relationship of almost nine years. She and I split (physically for COVID reasons) and it hit me that we would soon split altogether. Finally, I looked in the mirror and decided that for every conceivable reason I have to stop this.

I didn't realize HOW bad it was affecting me until I started my taper. I immediately went down to 9 grams/day, doing three 3g doses spread 6 hours apart morning/afternoon/evening. This was absolute hell for about 3-4 days. I couldn't sleep at all. I was experiencing very intense waves of emotional pain that I couldn't control. My back was aching non-stop. I couldn't focus on anything.

Then the business got the PPP loan and we started bringing staff back in. Calls/e-mails began ramping up. We began having tons of zoom meetings determining our new protocols and safety guidelines, etc - in short, I got very busy very fast. And in a very extroverted way (I'm a HEAVY introvert - this is exhausting). Luckily, after 3-4 days it started getting better. I was stabilizing at the 9g/day dose. But I couldn't believe how bad this was - probably the worst withdrawal of my life, to be honest. This stuff affects my mind and body in a profound way.

That was roughly a month ago and after 1 1/2 weeks or so, I began gradually tapering again. I'm down to 6g/day now, spread over 3 doses like above. I feel SO MUCH better, no longer mentally or emotionally unstable, no longer experiencing back pain or insomnia (I haven't slept this well in ages). But here is where I need advice:

I have four days coming up starting tomorrow, then 6 days off in June during the 2nd week. I've been planning to, starting tomorrow, cut out the middle dose entirely. Move the evening dose up a bit so that the remaining two doses are spread 8-10 hours apart. Let that stabilize over the four days, then stay at that level until my 6-day stretch of days off next month. Then go cold.

I'm curious - based on your experiences - whether you think this is a smart idea or not. The pressure is mounting at work and we're planning to open back up on May 28th. The flood gates may open with guests and I have a lot of responsibility and stress related to ensuring this is a safe environment for them and our staff. I'm very prone to stress so it's definitely a tough time. But I want to end this now, because otherwise, my next big stretch of time off will be late October (2 weeks vacation).

My options seem to be what I outlined above, or a continued gradual taper over the Summer and Fall with an end to this during my 2 weeks of vacation in October. I am committed to ending this either way - GREATLY prefer to end it sooner than later - I just have no idea if going cold will be worse than what I experienced before. No idea what the smartest move is given the situation. On one hand, going cold means my body no longer gets something it's been getting for \~3 years. On the other, the remaining daily intake is relatively low, so it may not be that rough?

Open to thoughts/suggestions though I realize this battle and decision is my own. Regardless, I do take comfort in the fact that I'm winning, and despite it being hell for a few days at the start, it's been going great and I feel better than I have in perhaps a couple of years.

Thanks for reading and stay safe everyone!

I confessed to my doctor about my Kratom use and am tapering very slowly.  She prescribed gabapentin 3x a day and don't feel much of an impact. 

 Tapering is difficult b/c I am taunted by a voice that keeps saying : ""just a little more for your last high, after all Kratom and I need closure"".   The problem is that I can talk myself into another  ""last high"", and Im off and running.   Then I bitch about how the taper didn't work; when in reality I did not work.    I did not use any of the coping  skills that I know.   I go  to 

addictive thinking,  distorting time and creating my own sense of logic to justify use.

I also found a bottle of tramadol and I am wondering if that can be useful for withdrawal.   I know its considered a narcotic but it never appealed to me;  I was able to use it appropriately    On the other hand I hesitate to use a drug to treat another drug habit.

to which I responded:

I've just read your post completely dumbfounded at the parallel.

I've had a very high Constitution in my life- been around people with mono, SARS, never broken an arm or a leg even when it should have happened. Never got sick. Hell, I get a cold may be ... once every half decade. Even got through Afghanistan without a scratch where I had no right to. The Kratom use came a few years after trying to assimilate back into society.

My biggest issue with attempting to quit Kratom CT has been what everyone seems to call RLS. I don't know why it's called that as I feel an unbearable tingling/ants crawling all over me - never really noticed it in my legs - more like my torso, back, arms- I suppose legs too but it's not the focus for me. If I don't dose on the regular, this unique feeling continues to increase in intensity until I can't function. In fact, I've never let it go too far because I feel like I'm going to start yelling. It's bad enough that I can't cover it up and act normal. I've also noticed that this feeling intensifies in a matter of minutes if I'm placed in a high stress situation. Why do I need an extra dose because of what's in my mind? Hell, I would find it scientifically fascinating if it wasn't me it was happening to. I've tried to quit but don't know how to get past the RLS. I can't last 8-12 hours without it unless I'm very busy and not paying attention- another weird tidbit. As soon as things get quiet (or high stress), BOOM! RLS! Time to dose!

Fast forward to 2020- I'm now years into it- hiding it from everyone - 32-40 gpd use. My biggest issue is more and more frequently I wake up in the middle of the night with ""full body RLS"" and cannot sleep until I dose. I try to ignore it, I get completely woken up until I dose. Then I have to bear it until the Kratom eventually takes effect and I can go back to sleep (1-2 hours). Going to sleep is also difficult. Frequently, before I fully fall asleep I spring awake as if shocked - almost as if my body thinks I've stopped breathing so gives me a shot of adrenaline and increases my heart rate substantially. I have to calm down then try to go to sleep again. It's a special day indeed when I get a full night's sleep these days.

In January I was diagnosed with Shingles- first real illness I've had in my 40 years. Doctor said, ""Yeah, we never see you- you have a clean history. Guess you were due - You know you're getting older. Have you had any major life changes - not eating right? sleeping? "" I didn't tell my Dr. anything because I'm ashamed but I think we all know what is weakening my body. Even my GI tract. Constant constipation. I mean, how many stool softeners can one take before one turns into one?

My doctor gave me a suite of prescriptions for the Shingles. Prednisone, an Anti Viral and... Gabapentin (30 pills). Now I've heard of Gabapentin through my searches re: how to get off Kratom and I laughed out loud at the pharmacist when I saw Gabapentin in my pharma bag. Is the universe trying to tell me something?

Now, here's the thing. I haven't taken it- not a single dose. I don't even know why I was prescribed it. I think a big part of not using it to quit Kratom was the fear that it may not do anything. And if it didn't, I didn't know what I was going to do. It's almost as if holding onto the hope that it \_could\_help was better in my mind then trying it and finding out that it didn't work. What would I do then?

So, I told my parents that I've finally gotten sick- got Shingles (weird since I've never had chicken pox and I was vaccinated). My father asks me what the Doctor gave me. I tell him and he said, ""Oh, Gabapentin? I have plenty of Gabapentin - here you go."" and returns with a massive bottle and hands it to me. I mean a kingsize bottle!

Ok, universe? What... are you trying to say here?

But even that wasn't enough. God forbid the Gabapentin didn't work- I can't get through the RLS! ""At least at this point I still have hope that it could work once I'm really serious about quitting!"" Yep, that's it.

So here I am having just discovered this reddit (screw you google for not showing this in specific searches. Thank you, Bing) and I'm scrolling through and found your story.

I apologize for the wall of text, but your post means more to me than I can express. It has given me that final push to give this Gabapentin a try and see if I can get past this RLS so I can actually quit this thing. Because I swear if I can just get past the RLS, I can do this.

Thank you.

The main reasons I quit were soulessness and having shits that came out in chunks rather than logs (descriptive, I know). I was frequently bloated and full quickly. My ALT liver enzymes were mildly elevated. Being in a state of constantly waiting to dose got in the way of enjoying life in the present.

I attempted to CT a while back, I just couldn‚Äôt handle the w/d and relapsed after 6 days. The break lowered my tolerance so I‚Äôve been steady on 20 gpd for a few months now. My best chance at this is a taper that doesn‚Äôt cause too much discomfort along the way, especially during sleep.

My **current** dosing pattern has been 7 grams of green leaf + 3 grams of red leaf at 7am, then the same thing at 4pm. So 10 grams twice daily.

-	I plan to start out by tapering down the red first, dropping 1 gram every 5th day, sticking to dosing twice a day.
-	Then I‚Äôll switch to dosing three times daily, removing .5 grams from my daily intake every 5th day

I may add agmatine if needed, and once I get to 5 gpd I‚Äôll start replacing .5 grams with stem and vein every 5th day.

Does this sound okay? Are there any other tips that might soften the blow? Supplements that may help? My BF is going to give me my doses and I want everything planned out to make it easier for him.

I recently went to rehab for my kratom addiction. I've been using 30-40g a day for 8 years long with some breaks in mean time.

I've tried to come off the kratom before multiple times by using medicines and drugs to catch up the kratom withdrawal. I've used a lot of (rc) benzodiazepines, alcohol, weed, ghb, and almost all kind of medicines to compensate the depression, restless and anxiety caused by the kratom withdrawal (I got RLS since I was 14, so the RLS was unbearable which resulted in getting no sleep for literally for 4 days straight)

&#x200B;

Due to my medicine/drug abuse I've lost my job which I liked a lot, and almost lost the contact with my family because all the trouble I've got in to by using drugs/medicines to compensate the kratom withdrawal. (Especially benzo/alcohol combination caused me A LOT of trouble. Using GHB for 2 weeks straight caused me to almost lose the contact with my family. (Getting knocked in the supermarket, went to the hospital etc)

&#x200B;

Now I've been to rehab for 1.5 months a week ago and it has been almost 2 months since I've used kratom.

In the clinic I've been prescribed benzodiazepines and sleep medicines for one month long. I've been using clonazolam and ketamin also in rehab to get rid off the RLS. (one week long) I have never ever experienced benzo withdrawals in my life before, even in much higher doses. (I barely feel anything from benzo's/sleep medicines, even with no tolerance)

&#x200B;

Now here's my question: From the beginning of stopping kratom I got horrible heartbeatings that wont go away. I do cardio and power training almost every day, eat as healthy as I can and i'm trying to reduce the stress as much as possible (the anxiety at this moment for the past 2 weeks has been a little more than usual, especially in the morning I get anxious) 

Has this still have to do something with the kratom withdrawal, or is this some withdrawaling because of the benzo's I've been using? And what do you guys suggest to get rid off the heartbeatings? I dont panic because of it, it is just REALLY annoying and I feel like drinking alcohol every day to get rid of it!) 

&#x200B;

The second issue I have is my stomach cramps/diarrhea that I have for almost one month and 2 weeks now. It just doesn't get away whatever I do. (I drink enough water every day and try to eat as healthy as I can.)  I've also been using omepazol (stomach protection) for almost one month and 2 weeks straight now without any good results. 

&#x200B;

At my previous attempt to get off the kratom I had the same long term issues (heartbeatings and stomach issues) for as long as I've been clean to kratom, around 3-4 months.

&#x200B;

I would like to know if these issues still have to do something with the kratom i've been using or if this has something to do with all the medicines I've been using (I've also been using ibuprofen 5x400mg a day for 2 weeks) And I would like to know how to get rid off the heartbeatings and stomach pain!

Last dose was 9 PM last night so 13 hours in. Already the stomach discomfort is settling in. We all know this much too well. Going to dump the rest of the powder I have on hand today and then prepare for the worst. I don‚Äôt have much in way of comfort meds but here is my plan:

1. Imodium to keep diarrhea in check at least for first several days. 

2. Tea. Lots of tea. Chamomile and mint are my favorite. 

3. Frequent walks. Helps with the anxiety and RLS. I will typically take as long of a brisk walk as I can tolerate, then come home and take a hot shower and immediately lay down and try to grab a few fleeing minutes of sleep. 

4. ASMR - this helped me so much the first few nights of no sleep to help calm the anxiety around not being able to fall asleep. I learned this from my last quit and it helps to keep your mind off the sleeplessness which helps prevent anxiety from spiraling out of control. 

5. New this time - Xanax. I‚Äôve never been on anti anxiety meds but my wife got a prescription 2 months ago and I rarely takes it. Planning on only taking the first two nights 0.5 mg each night to get through the initial suckiness. If I feel surprisingly calm at night I may forego it altogether. 

6. Melatonin - taken an hour before ‚Äúbed‚Äù usually helps me fall asleep initially but I inevitably will wake up a few hours later

It is more rich in the other alkaloids present in kratom besides mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine. Other kratom users have used it to quit or lower tolerance. It is particularly more abundant in the alkaloids that boost NMDA antagonism and immunity. NMDA antagonism lowers opioid tolerance and lowers the addiction and reinforcing effects.  I added 0.5g of stem and vein to my morning 5g dose and I feel more balanced as far as not as high. I still feel medicated but I don't feel like I did a drug that feels like I need to compulsively re-dose throughout the day. It is still early to tell but I've been experimenting it for a few days. I can say that it is definitely a game changer for those who want to quit or taper off kratom, make it more balanced and less addictive, and improve your health while using kratom. Think about it this way, by taking the stem and the vein in addition to the plain leaf you will have a more balanced diversity of the alkaloid profile.

I'm so done. I've been done for months but cannot find the discipline to taper or the guts to go cold turkey. It feels like my desire to quit has become an obsession just as consuming as the kratom itself. It's splitting my head in two. 

Tomorrow I will start 7 days inpatient rehab. The doctor really freaked me out by telling me that kratom use, although only amounting to 5-10% of the opiate addicts at the facility, is much harder to quit because the withdrawal lasts so much longer. He told me oxy users can spend 7-10 days detoxing and be mostly okay by day 11. Kratom however lasts much longer and they do not even know how long because of the little information there is on this substance.

Some notes on whats going on. I can feel every muscle in a bad way. RLS is obvious. Light, but constant headache. What has surprised me so far is my mood. I know it is still bound to get worse, but i feel great in my head. I am doing things again. Even though my body has no energy my mind is processing real emotion, which is something i haven't felt in a very long time. I am so optimistic.

Slept pretty long last night. I took a small amount of Xanax and had my good friend weed to help me. I will take Xanax again tonight, and then tomorrow if i really need it. After that im not going to take any more.Don't want to just get addicted to something else now.

Things seem strange. My world is pain right now but with a huge light. I can see the difference quitting this garbage is going to make, and i know i am just weeks away from being my old self or at least close to it.  I now know for a fact that i will never touch that shit again.

It took me a year to decide to do it and these are the kinds of posts that helped me the most. So I‚Äôm here to hopefully pay it forward. 

First of all: you CAN do this.

Second: yes, life DOES get better. 
‚ÄúBut what if that‚Äôs not how it works for me?‚Äù you might be wondering. ‚ÄúMaybe this is the only real good thing in my life and my boredom with the rest of the world wont go away.‚Äù
It does. TRUST ME, it does. 

I quit CT from drinking it as a tea‚Äîmy husband and I went through a gallon apiece every day or two. I‚Äôll be honest with you: withdrawals were rough. I had terrible restless leg, anxiety, felt for a few days like my skin hurt. A few friends told me later I looked like hell. 

But then it ended. I think what kept me going was knowing that it would end. I hate the feeling of being uncomfortable and not knowing when or if it would go away. But with this I knew after the first 3 or 4 days it would start to get better so I hung in‚Äîand it absolutely did get better. 

So how has my life improved?
- I sleep normally again. I used to be able to sleep for 16+ hours OR could stay up for more than 24. My body is back to being, well, normal for me; I‚Äôm still a night owl as I‚Äôve always been, but I get sleepy now and not just weirdly bone-tired. I also feel sleepy in the mornings in a regular way, not that ‚Äúman I could sleep for another 8‚Äù feeling. 

- I like stuff again. Like really like it. Videogames, shows, books. I forgot what it felt like to feel really, actually good while enjoying my hobbies. 

- I‚Äôm motivated again. I mean, chores still suck BUT they are no longer abysmally horrible and overwhelming. 

- Sex is better. While using I used to have issues with achieving an orgasm (I‚Äôm cis-female, in my 30s) and those troubles are gone now. 

- Weirdly, and much to my surprise, I have LESS anxiety now. One of the reasons I started using was because I was led to believe kratom would help with my anxiety disorder, and it did‚Äîat first. But I eventually got to the point where I was having random panic attacks or bouts of severe anxiety. That‚Äôs gone now too.

- My stomach doesn‚Äôt hate me anymore. I actually thought this was just a symptom of ‚Äúgetting older,‚Äù because foods started disagreeing with me. I would get terrible nausea or upset stomach easily from various foods (red meat, anything oily, anything too rich or heavy). But turns out it was the kratom. 

If you‚Äôre reading this, I believe in you, even though I don‚Äôt even know you. Because you‚Äôre here. And deep down you know that means you want to quit, too. You CAN do this and we are all here for you!

But now, without kratom, there are days where my skin is just crawling. I have no desire to be entirely sober, so I drink. And I hate drinking, and it makes me miss kratom because there is no hangover, no headaches, and a lot less guilt.

2020-05-13 20:13:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/gjb9th/id_like_to_share_the_piece_of_advice_my_therapist/,I‚Äôd like to share the piece of advice my therapist gave me that changed my mindset and finally helped me put kratom behind me for good,"I was at a session with my therapist last September after my fourth failed quit attempt and was at the end of my rope. I told her that I couldn‚Äôt understand why I kept going back to kratom even though I was miserable on the stuff. Without even skipping a beat, she said something to me that literally changed everything:

‚ÄúI think you use kratom because you desperately seek control in times of chaos. Kratom is a method of exerting control for you, but it‚Äôs also a vector for chaos...so you‚Äôre trapped in a never ending feedback loop. The next time you quit and have the desire to use again, think about what you‚Äôre trying to control, whether or not it‚Äôs rational, and if there are healthier ways to achieve the control you‚Äôre looking for. You need to break the feedback loop, and that means learning to let go‚Äù.

This immediately made sense to me; I had an abusive, turbulent childhood that meant my happiness and even safety were totally out of my hands. Trauma survivors often seek comfort through control and this can often translate to addiction later on. Once I started ‚Äúletting go‚Äù I was able to talk myself out of the thought patterns that kept hindering my recovery. I see a lot of people here display similar tendencies, so I thought I‚Äôd share some of the ways I found myself seeking control so you might recognize it in your own behavior.

**Seeking to control how you feel at all times.** This one is probably the most obvious and the most pervasive. Anxiety is a normal, human experience. Most people have bouts of depression. Most people have chunks of time where they sleep poorly. Getting your heart broken is also a human experience. Snuffing these out with kratom is not only unsustainable, it‚Äôs contributing to more emotional/psychological instability in the long term. All of these experiences will pass with time and there are healthy ways to work through them that don‚Äôt involve kratom.

**The ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ALL or NOTHING!‚Äù approach.** this was my Achilles heel before I successfully quit. You decide you want to get off kratom, then BAM...you dive in head first with no regard for setting yourself up for lasting success. Maybe you flush your stash even though you‚Äôve been on very high doses of kratom for years. Maybe you ‚Äútaper‚Äù by making a few huge cuts and then jumping over the span of less than two weeks.

I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I intended to do a slow taper, but wound up going way too fast because I was impatient, then of course I‚Äôd relapse because it was (gasp!) uncomfortable or the PAWS were too unbearable. Tapering is basically pointless if you‚Äôre not going to do it methodically.

Try to stop, take a breath, and think about what you need to make this a successful quit. Really weigh your various options, their pros and cons, and whether you see yourself capable of handling each con. It‚Äôs better to take two months to quit if it means you‚Äôll be kratom free for the rest of your life. It‚Äôs better to cold turkey if you know you can‚Äôt stick to a taper and don‚Äôt live with someone that can dole out your doses for you.

Either way, the key is to have a plan laid out ahead of time and avoid listening to urges to deviate once that plan is in motion. When you think ‚ÄúI just want to be off NOW!‚Äù Ask yourself: have you set up an appointment with an addiction therapist? Signed up for meetings? Gotten an accountability buddy? Be careful not to put the cart before the horse.

**Buying and taking fistfuls of supplements and helper meds.** Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong‚Äîthere‚Äôs absolutely nothing wrong with using these to aid your quit. But if you‚Äôre taking 5+ different things, be mindful of what‚Äôs happening here. I realized I‚Äôd set myself up for thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking all of these things and this still sucks, screw this I‚Äôm taking kratom!‚Äù Go into it understanding that withdrawal isn‚Äôt fun, and if the supplements help, great. If not, it was worth a try. And in some cases, improper use of certain supplements/meds can actually hinder your recovery or lead to other addictions.

**Waiting for that perfect time to quit.** If you‚Äôre an addict, you will always manage to find an excuse as to why now just isn‚Äôt a good time. Life doesn‚Äôt stop for our addiction, as much as we wish it would. If you have intended to quit for many months now and keep putting it off for one reason or another, it‚Äôs time to acknowledge: that‚Äôs the addiction talking, plain and simple. Try to find solutions for the things that are standing in your way and try to accept that things are just going to be hard for a bit. But it will pass, you will get through it and be happy that you did it.

**I‚Äôm not taking kratom, so I‚Äôm going to use another intoxicating substance in its place.** This goes back to wanting to control how you feel. Stuff like alcohol, phenibut, benzos, etc should be avoided at all cost unless you have someone that can oversee and manage your use. You don‚Äôt want to train yourself that any substance is the answer to feelings or symptoms that you don‚Äôt want to experience. All of these things can actually lead to heightened anxiety once they leave your system, which makes you want to take more. Alcohol specifically makes it harder on your body to detox kratom out of your system.

I‚Äôm sorry this is so long, but I hope that it helps at least one person out there who is struggling to put this stuff behind them for good. You CAN do this, and I can‚Äôt adequately explain how much better life will be once you do. Sending all my love and well wishes to each of you üíó",100,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5044378}"

&#x200B;

Just wanted to get my thoughts down in writing in hopes that it will help me follow through this time.  I have visited this sub occasionally over the years and always resonated with all the stories here, but never posted before.

&#x200B;

My Kratom history began when I finished college and had to move back into my moms house, I had no job lined up and had stopped smoking weed for the job search (4 years of heavy daily use of weed before this).  I had known about Kratom before but never tried it, I came across it again when looking for some type of legal high to basically replace weed with that needed to be safe, not have much if any smell, and was cheap.  Kratom seemed to check all the boxes so I ordered some to try.  After researching the best starting dose I landed on 5 grams which was way too much for me, I ended up vomiting and nodding out in my bed for a few hours.  I was blown away by how effective it was when a lot of online reports made it seem super mild.  

&#x200B;

I started to use it once a week as I knew about the addiction potential of it, then a couple times per week, etc you know how that goes.  I think what really got me in trouble was starting to use it before working my construction job at the time.  Made the job nearly enjoyable, for about a year I only dosed 3 grams once in the morning, then added an evening dose to help relax at night instead of drinking.  So far everything was still amazing, I even went a week without taking any around this time with minimal issues.  

&#x200B;

I ended up moving in with my girlfriend in another city, and got a new job that was extremely stressful and shitty (call center) but paid decently.  Started smoking a lot of weed again in addition to the Kratom.  Sometime around here I started adding a night dose to help sleep which I quickly became dependent on.  So at this point I was dosing 3 grams (my standard dose) 3 times per day.  

&#x200B;

Now I'm not going to spend too much time on this next part, but the same year I started this job, I came across a dead relatives cancer medication (they died in the 90's) consisting of a shit ton of Morphine, Hydromorphone, and some other various paid meds.  The exact same pattern happened from when I first started Kratom, once a month, once per week, up to daily use.  These pills lasted about a year and a half before I ran out, having developed a much stronger dependence than ever before.  At this point I finally admitted to myself I had a problem, but didn't want to stop.  Discovered and started using poppy seed tea, and used that for about another year and a half until prices started to skyrocket and decided I had to get off of it.

&#x200B;

I tapered down as best I could, then switched back to Kratom, was miserable for about a month but the Kratom really helped.  I was taking the most I ever have, about 5-6 grams per dose 4-5 times per day.  Over the next year I tapered down to 1 gram doses 3 times per day with the intention of quitting.  I can't remember what exactly set me off but I ended up going back up to my usual 3 gram doses 3-4 times per day.  Through all of this I worked the same shitty job and got increasingly depressed and miserable.  It finally all came to a head last fall when I decided to quit my job with no new job lined up, in part so I could finally get myself off Kratom.  

&#x200B;

I have now been unemployed for almost 9 months, and between COVID, my bank account dwindling, and a few supposedly sure fire job opportunities that fell through, I have been as depressed as ever and using more Kratom.  So currently I am at 3 gram doses 4 times per day.  I notice significant withdrawals when skipping a dose, so planning a taper.  I am just so damn tired of being dependent on it to get through the day and am feeling a need to start taking care of my body.  I'm a bit underweight from not eating to ensure the Kratom works the best and just have never lived a very healthy lifestyle. The Kratom, opiates and weed have kept me from feeling anything over the last 6 years, destroyed my motivation (which was bad to begin with) and helped keep me content in a miserable job not advancing my career like I should have been.

  
I'm at a point now that I've been at many times before, depressed and pissed off at myself for letting it get so bad and wanting to make a change.  So here we go again, it's gonna suck for a long time but I know eventually it will get better.

Like many on here, I am a recovering alcoholic. I am 2 and half years sober, but not really since pretty much from the beginning I found Kratom and just traded addictions. I am also pretty hooked on Red Dawn Energy Enchancing stuff that also has bad withdrawal. The withdrawal and fear that I won't enjoy the things I do now is keeping me from kicking it. I know I will have to go CT because tapering, much like with drinking, would not be possible. Working 9-5 Mon-Fri at 7:30am is making me nervous because I can let me work suffer if I am not getting sleep or in pain.

Hi everyone! I'm back here yet again on a different account since I've shared my old one with some friends. I've miraculously managed to keep my addiction hidden and stable for years. I tried quitting twice. After the first time, my chronic pain issues made it impossible (I have severe endometriosis). The second time I gave in when the PAWS hit after two weeks. I was afraid of what my brain was doing to my life. I spent a lot of time curled up in the shower crying. I figured I was a better friend and employee on kratom so I went back to it.

I got a really good job offer for the fall. It is, however, in the middle of absolute nowhere. I find myself either immediately needing to taper and quit or I could bring a kilo with me and taper in the mountains. The concern is that it will be extremely physically and mentally difficult. It involves trail maintenance and building which requires long stretches of backpacking and sleeping in rough conditions. I also may eventually be leading people on wilderness trips which is a lot of responsibility. I obviously need to be on the top of my game to make this work. Maybe my PAWS would be helped by the wilderness but maybe it will make me slip up (literally) and hurt myself or companions. I can't turn this job down. Its my dream job and there aren't exactly a lot of jobs available these days where I am from.

Plan #1: start tapering immediately. I take 15-40g a day depending on my pain levels. Then taper down to 5g a day when I start the job in August. If I bring a kilo with me, will I be able to last for a long time without extreme withdrawal. However, would I really have the self control to only have the once dose a day so I could sleep?

Plan #2: taper for May/June and then quit. Maybe 30 days would be enough time to get myself feeling normal?

Plan #3: Do a hard 2 week taper and then quit. The problem is that I need to physically train. I also need to work my construction/landscaping job to save money for my gear. I know working out helps, but the motivation to workout needs to be there. Also, my husband uses as well. He's not interested in quitting. It would be hard to do it if he is still using.

Does soboxone work for kratom withdrawal? Any other meds that do? I used skullcap last time and I have a friend who is an herbalist who could help me out with other herbal remedies. I'm looking more for prescription options that might have worked for you all. Should I look into antidepressants? What should I tell my doctor?

I'm not letting kratom take this opportunity away from me. One way or another this is the time.

I started taking a bit more than normal when the lock down started sometime in March. For about a year i had been taking approximately 2 -3 teaspoons once in the evening about 5 times a week since mid march I have been doing twice that daily, almost ever day. I ran out on like Friday, and just hadn't gotten around to ordering more, and didn't think much of it to be honest. 

Then on Sunday i started having a really hard time controlling my temperature, especially at night- would get sweaty, throw the blankets off, and then chilly, repeat. This happened again on Monday night, and i was so confused and freaked out. I couldn't for the life of me figure out what was going on and started freaking out that it was early menopause or something. Then I realized that the only thing that had changed was the kratom, and i decided to google it and found myself here. Im kind of freaked out to be honest. 

I have gone without many times with no issues- i went on vacation for 2.5 weeks in January and was totally fine- didn't even think about Kratom on the trip, but this was before i had been taking more. 

Reading people‚Äôs wd sounds really scary- i have never been addicted to anything before (except cigarettes but quit about 5 years ago) or gone through withdrawl. Paws? WTF?! Should i order more and try to taper? Or stick this out? I think today is the 5th day i‚Äôve gone without. The temperature regulation has gotten a bit better i think and i don't feel as lethargic as i did Sunday and Monday. Also, when i was taking kratom i didn't really feel depressed or anxious, nor did i feel anxious or depressed before for that matter.

First 7 days really sucked. I swear every damn time it gets worse. Today it's like the fog lifted though all of a sudden. One thing I did different today though was took naltrexone. See this time in my recovery from drugs and alcohol I'm trying something different. Told my doctor I wanted naltrexone to stop drinking and they will happily prescribe it no questions asked. My main problems in life are opiates and alcohol so I plan to keep naltrexone in my car. My wallet. My house. Always in reach. As soon as a craving pops up I will be saying fuck you and take a naltrexone. Not everyday just every time I have a craving. I know how cravings work and its usually a battle between good and evil in your mind. Takes a little time before you finally break and decide to use whatever your drug of choice for that day is. Great thing about naltrexone is it blocks opiates like kratom for 48 hours or more and on a positive it blocks you from feeling good drinking alcohol for the day. I think what I'm trying to do is learn to punish my cravings and train my brain to realize when I have cravings theres no point because I'll just pop a naltrexone right away.

For reference, I was using 6-8GPD and had been using for about 3 years with a short break in the middle. 

1. Loperamide helped me with RLS. The worst physical symptom I experienced was restless leg / restless abdomen syndrome. When it got bad, I‚Äôd take 2-3 loperamide tabs and it would really help. 

2. Hard workouts were very helpful. Even just going on a 30 minute walk helped my brain reset, but a good hard workout made me feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for an hour afterwards. It‚Äôs cliche, but exercise will help your mood and physical symptoms. 

3. The mental withdrawal kicked in around day 6 and lasted for 2 weeks. This was, by far, the worst part. I felt depressed, anxious, close to tears for days on end. If I hadn‚Äôt been expecting to feel this way I might have thought I was losing my mind. When you get to this part, just know that IT IS THE KRATOM and will end. Do whatever it takes to get through it. 

4. Valerian Root + Melatonin + CBD oil worked for me as a ‚Äúsleep stack.‚Äù I was actually able to sleep ok after the first night or so, and this stuff all helped (plus loperamide on RLS nights). 

On the other side, my confidence is back, I‚Äôm happier than I‚Äôve been in months, and every day is an opportunity to feel GOOD.

It refers to the experience during the recovery process of intense periods of energy, happiness, even euphoria, the idea that you‚Äôre ‚Äúall better‚Äù, followed by a period of low energy, an experience of reality as mundane, and possible depression and anxiety. The two things to notice about this are these: 1. The one ALWAYS gives way to the other.

It has been a godsend as i struggle through this...i‚Äôve learned so much and am reminded daily that im not alone in my struggle. 

This is my 3rd time quitting Kratom. Im a drug addict and i use kratom to get high...simple as that. Yeah i suffer from anxiety and depression too...but to me its a chicken and egg kinda thing. Kratom makes me feel good and covers up my fear, anxiety and depression...but it will never cure it and at some point starts making it worse. At my core...i know its not healthy for me and it just offers temporary relief to the challenge of life. Im married to an amazing woman, have great kids, great job....why do i need kratom to make me happy?
Kratom is my dirty secret...nobody knows im taking it. Ive been taking 10-12 gpd in opms silver capsules for 18 months now.. costs about $250/month. 
4 weeks ago i decided i was done...from my previous experiences i know its gonna suck. After reading everything i could this is what i did and am doing. I decided on a 4 week taper. I take capsules so it was easy for me to control and regulate dose during taper.  At my max 4 weeks ago i was taking 7-8 capsules(4 gs) 3 times a day. The first  thing i did was cut dose in half and starting taking 6 capsules(3gs) 2 times a day....i dosed everday at same time 9 am and 9 pm...for 4 days. Then dropped 1 capsule off each dose every 4 days...keeping the same twice a day  dosing schedule. So i took 12 capsules daily  the first 4 days...then 10 the next 4 days...then 8 the next 4 days then 6 the next 4 days...always split betwen a morning and evening dose. Im down to my last 2 capsules tonight...and tomorrow will be my first day not taking kratom in 18 months. 
I feel one of the most useful things i did...and i cant recommend this strong enough is i planned, counted and seperated out my entire 4 week taper supply. I bought a box of ziploc snack bags...and i wrote in sharpie on every one the date and am and pm and i filled it with the appropriate # of capsules for that scheduled dose. I kept those 60 seperate bags of preplanned doses in a safe spot and i told myself thats it...i will not deviate from the planned dose that is set in that days bag. This could definitely work with those of you who take powder too....just will be more work to measure out. This was really important to my success.

As expected...ive been secretly and quietly suffering for 3-4 weeks straight. The lack of sleep and restlessness is the worst. I did get a script for 20 ambien pills to help me sleep but i still only average 3-4 hours a night. Im anxious, exhausted, emotional and fatigued. Its gotten better as i tapered down...but not much. Other then the ambien ive been taking magnesium, ashwaganda, vitamin c, hylands restless legs stuff...im not sure how much any of it is helping. I know from past experience its all about time...im expecting my suffering to cease about 6-7 days after my last dose tonight. I think my suffering would be much worse if i went cold turkey...but tapering takes discipline and my snack baggy system was key. 

The other experience i  will share and advise to others quitting kratom is to stay busy through out the day to  distract yourself from the misery...exercise, walk, fish, explore, anything. When you‚Äôre exhausted and fatigued and depressed its the last thing you wanna do but it will mske you feel better and help you get through day.

So sorry i rambled on so long...wish me luck tomorrow. I am proud and excited to be kratom free again. Ill circle back with an update in a few days. Hang in there all....",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.41811052}"

So for almost a year I've been taking OPMS Gold daily in one heavy dose. It started slow with 1 cap than 2, 3 and at one point 4. For the past 5ish months I've been very steady at 3 caps a day in one dose, so roughly 21 grams of leaf. My problem is now I'm experiencing withdrawals (rls in my arms) at night and hardly getting any sleep. I've tried almost every option to curb this, over the counter rls medicine, cbd (gel caps and now flower), and kava. The only thing that works is kava to an extent but I've stopped that as I don't want to fight fire with fire and I've only tried that for a few nights a week for a short period and have taken that off the table. 

On bad nights where I can predict it will be bad is to take a half cap so 3-4ish grams of leaf which works wonderful. No Rls until maybe right before I wake up but it's not bad at all.

So I've constantly have been wanting to taper completely off but I can't take not getting sleep. 

So the question is, should I continue with one dose a day and the occasional nightly pick me up and taper the 3 down to 2 etc. Or should I break my 3 caps into 2 during the day and 1 a few hours before sleep with the intention of getting down to 1 during the day and one before bed and go from there.

My fear is I don't want to have to rely on the nightly dose to sleep, I can deal with the other withdrawals but the rls at night is driving me crazy.

Again thank you to anyone who reads this and replies!

 Long post since this is my First post here, but I need help badly... so I'll start off by saying I originally used Kratom to come off 80mg oxies from lifeong cervical/lumbar injuries...  then I switched to those o.p.s extracts for 5 years, probably at 15 to 22 thousands a year because it was easiest way.  I know I'm a moron and shit away what other people could live on, and I stopped respecting myself.  

This community was extremely helpful but I stayed in shadow,  it was really tough but I just tapered from 4 vials a day (approx 52mg or so) to half (6mg) by end of a week.   So I had made it to day 10.  Thank you to all who post for that. 

But I found out that my girl of several years staged a fight a week ago and got me to push away and used it as excuse to get with someone else (I found out last night from another source).  I was in love, we both were, but another guy was secretly wedging in over weeks without me knowing. 

So today I took 6g equivalent because my heart was beating nonstop from last night to this morning and it felt like I was back to say 1.  I know it was just massive emotion at a horrible time my body had grown numb to, but I do not know quite what to do.. I'm Def not planning on going back to Kratom because I was just starting to feel life ahead of me with a smile.   I don't want to feel that anxiety and heart palpitation again.

Day 2 without you, and you have now added restless leg syndrome, trouble sleeping, and muscle twitching to your arsenal to go along with no dopamine and sweating...awesome, thanks Kratom. Since you wouldn't let me sleep, I did some research about you and found that you do have a place in this world. I have to give you credit where credit is due. You have given people their lives back from the areas in which they struggle - depression, pain, and drug addiction to name a few. You saved people from heroin and opiate addictions, which eventually they would have succumbed to. If people could learn to let you go after you have helped them with their withdrawal, you would be a asset to the addict community. Unfortunately that's not the case. At least not for me. 
I am itching to get my life back but I know you are not through with me yet. I wish I knew what you have in store for me next so I can prepare. Unfortunately, you use different techniques as a way to get people to crash and burn so you can get your claws in again. It's just not fair, but hey, there is nothing fair in this crazy world we live in today, especially when you're an addict. At least that's the lie we tell ourselves.

Instead of traditional steeping I prefer to simmer the tea for 10 minutes to get the most medicinal effect out of it. It's flavor is usually strong so I toss in a bag of fruit tea too to improve the flavor, then chill it and drink it on ice (also helps flavor).

It rapidly got better day by day, this was about 2 weeks since my last dose. Perhaps feeling normal(the first couple days, actually feeling quite a buzz) that week then jumping to nothing pinging the receptors gave me a bit of a shock. The rapid taper appeared to work, did not postpone withdrawal or give me suboxone withdrawal.

I've also been given clonidine, it definitely helps with the mild restlessness I've been having at night.

Aches are gone, chills are gone. I feel good, my hair was falling out and I believe Kratom was to blame, so that's a good incentive to not pick it up again. I'd probably lose my girlfriend if I go back. Made a post a couple weeks ago about how things were not good between us during my detox, she was looking for the door. The situation has resolved itself. We've had a lot of good days together, intimacy has gotten better(no doubt Kratom was hurting us in that department). The distance I was feeling from her isn't there anymore.

Don't spend too much time reading the horror stories. It might take you 20 days to feel normal, it might take you 30. Who knows? When you're on the other side of it, there'll be a massive sigh of relief. Enjoy the pink cloud, but start replacing bad habits with healthy ones. PAWS might night be avoidable for you, but hell there's a lot you can do to help those dopamine receptors along. Hope everyone is doing alright. Lots of good tips on this sub to get through this, thanks everyone.",3,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.44489524}"

I feel like crying and jumping out of my skin. 

Yet i should be grateful.. most of the really bad physical symptoms are gone..and i did this. I got myself here. I was strong. I should feel great and be proud of myself..

Yesterday was my first mothers day with my 5 month old and my amazing bf who treats me so good. 

Yet, i feel so down rn. So anxious. Maybe its the quarantine making me still not feel normal. I cant go back t owork yet bc daycare isnt open and i cant afford it yet anyway. Luckily i can work from home. But i have no motivation to do so.

I know the things i can do to keep busy. But this anxiety is taking over me rn.. i wanna break down and give up but at the same time dont.

Its a constant fn battle in my head. Do ppl really get freedom from this back n forth thought process? Just a little bit will relax me.. but then ill feel disappointed and more hours away from feeling totally free again.

Although, this morning felt great to wake up and not feel as physcially dependent on it anymore im still mentally struggling.

I should know it gets better. I was a heroin addict and quit and been sober for 7 years from that shit.... it got bettter.. 

I replaced the anxious thoughts with working out. But now with a baby its hard to go to the gym.. im trying to find the motivation to work out at home. I just get so overwhlemed.  Being a mommy is hard. Not to say im not extremely grateful... shes all i ever wanted... idk.. maybe if i had myfamily around id feel better.. theyre all in new york.. maybe if i had some friends.. i have none.. just my ""work peers"" who i mostly cant stand..not like i hang out with them out of work anyway.. its pretty lonely not having friends..

Anyway.. day 6.. i did fuck up the other day on day 3 a little and didnt even feel the shit i only felt disappointed and dizzy... but i told myself im still counting my days so i dont feel defeated by this shit.  T

Thank u guys for being here for me.

Youve all helped me get this far. For real. Im so grateful.. im so proud of myself.  Thank u for reading my rants and giving such positive feedback.. i know im not alone.‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°",24,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.47646022}"

2020-05-11 00:08:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/ghggot/cravings_after_five_months/,Cravings after Five Months,"Hello,

I had previously used 20-25 gpd of non-extract powder per day for about 4-5 years. I ended my taper in the middle of last December. So, it has been five months for me without any kratom at all. Generally, I'm very good. I got over the acute withdrawals within two weeks and I'm living my life normally. Kratom is generally not an issue in my life anymore.

However, I am still hit almost every night with cravings for kratom. They are frankly pretty intense sometimes. They're never intense enough that I would go and buy kratom again, but it is really annoying. I think my issue is that for several years I would take a kratom ""night cap"" and now, when bedtime arrives, my brain is still looking for that feeling.

This is my only remaining issue with quitting kratom. I read that it might not be uncommon for former opioid users to have cravings for months after quitting. It has been a full five months, but I was taking kratom for years. Maybe I just need to give my brain more time to re-adjust? Anyone else have a similar experience?",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.51536995}"

Basically, it was stated that there is a high rate of failure in addicts attempting to quit if they do not replace the habit of using with a different, positive habit, during triggers.

So my question is this: When you have a trigger, what habit did you end up adopting instead of using? Really need some tips.

I didn't even follow a strict regimen at first just sort of eyeballed my doses lower and lower (I have a scale now I don't eyeball anymore).  It was surprisingly easy at first.  I barely noticed I was dropping my dosage down until I got to around 15gpd now it's definitely gotten more challenging.  I'm going much slower now only dropping 1 gram every 5-7 days or longer.  I really feel each drop now.  The pale sickly look I had has improved somewhat but the worst is my skin and that hasn't improved yet.  


My face looks awful.  I've got wrinkles at 32 and perpetual dark circles under the eyes.  I've got a reddish rash around my nose, pock marks on my one cheek, and slight patches of hyperpigmentation.  I have a red rash around my mouth and angry red pustules on my chin.  I have a huge red cyst near my ear and jawline that has been on my face for weeks.  I have acne all over my back.  I also have what appears to be eczema developing on my chest and my neck.  Every time I dose the kratom it seems to inflame these areas ever so slightly.  It basically makes all my rashes burn and itch an hour or so after dosing.  Not to mention it seems to mess with my blood pressure and makes my anxiety worse.

Basically it just doesn't feel as safe to me as it once did and I have no doubt that it has begun to negatively impact my health.  Everyone who uses it heavily and long enough starts to slowly realize that they are poisoning themselves with this plant but by the time you realize it you are dependent.  I feel like there's something in the leaf that's become toxic to me now and it sucks because I still NEED to take it just to function.  Today was 10 gpd though.  That's the lowest dose yet.  I'll sit here at 10 until I feel ready to shave another gram off.  I just hope my skin improves as I slowly whittle my dose down.

I could go on and on about all of the weird subtle negative aspects but it's nice to be among people who know exactly what you are talking about.  So I'm just sharing all of this to check in and hopefully I'll be hanging around for a while.

I remember I had heard or read that RLS could be helped by compression; that it tricked the brain into stopping the rls signalling to the leg muscles to move or twitch.

So I tried it out. But being in detox I couldnt just leave ang buy compression socks at a pharmacy. But what I came up with was even better: I asked the nurse if I could have two tensor bandages and I explained to her why. 

That night before I went to bed I wrapped each leg up nice and snug to just to above the knee. I slept in such a way that I had my feet planted against the wall which help immobilize them too, but I'm telling you, the wraps helped tremendously. With the slight pressure on every part of my leg and planted I had no sensation to move my feet and I nodded off.

Try it out! On top of the supplements it may really help some of you out there who are suffering from RLS due to kratom w/d. I'm day 2 CT of kratom so far so good!",11,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.8628686}"

  When I met you I was at the end of my alcohol career. You helped me curb my cravings for alcohol which I am very grateful for. You helped me with my anger issues and made everything in life fun and exciting. You were the friend I needed at the time. A shining star. I though we would be best friends forever! After a while you started showing your true colors. All you wanted me to do was stay in bed, enjoy each other's company, and do nothing. I quit going to the gym, taking care of myself, eating, and lost interest in life. I tried to include you in the things I wanted to do but you would not allow it. I started to lose interest in you. I wanted my life back. I think you realized this and introduced me to you friend, opms...which made life seem incredible. He was expensive and got me to start dipping and drinking coffee at an alarming rate. I didn't care. I just loved how I felt and never wanted to look back. In a few months, he got his claws in me deep and wouldn't let go no matter what I did. I went to rehab a couple of times but he always seemed to come back into my life. Each time, his claws went deeper in me. Since he was way stronger, I paid the price with my physical and mental health. I tried weaning off but each time you guys realized what I was doing and sabotaged my plans. I'm at the point to where I have to just drop you guys and run like hell. I'm ready to pay the price for being friends with you. It's gonna be very uncomfortable, and the awesome feelings you gave me will always be on my mind while I get rid of you. Unfortunately, you will always be there to take me back with open arms. I'm not gonna let you ruin what's left in my life you have not yet destroyed. My life has become unbearable with you in it. I will make sure everyone knows what a bad friend you are and that you will destroy their life too!

It was a weekend thing initially, but slowly became a daily thing.  I knew deep down that it had become a problem, but was clever in minimizing the actual situation.   The euphoria and feeling of well being that initially drew me to kratom had long since passed.  By the end I felt empty without kratom, and ok when I took it.  I wasted a lot of money and time using it.  It killed my sex drive and left me feeling empty and lost.  My wife knew I took it, but she was very unaware of the big picture.   The cost and frequency of my addiction was my own hidden secret.  I finally came clean about all of it and said that I was aware that I had crossed the line and needed to remedy the situation.   I felt good about being honest for once about this life sucking situation.   It also made me more accountable for my own actions.  I drank heavily when I was young and was a stoner before that, but I never had any opiate addictions like many here discuss.  I used the opms shots, silver packs, and powders.  Probably about 20gpd.  

Fortunately I didnt have much in regards to withdrawals.   The first 2 days I was unusually exhausted and I did notice some muscle aches for the first week, which I found strange since I havent been going to the gyms ( which are closed ).  My moods have also been a little off balance.  I have times when I feel great, then I start to feel irritated for little or no reason.  

I'm hoping my sex drive kicks back in soon.  For me, that was one of the worst aspects of this.  

I will never go back to using this plant.  The cons have far surpassed the temporary and short lived pros.  

Remember why you want to close this chapter of your life.  Even if your current situation isnt great, this addiction will only make it worse.

So it‚Äôs been 5 months since I went to a detox clinic to get off Kratom, and it‚Äôs been a lot of ups and downs. I‚Äôve maintained sobriety from being on Vivitrol, but as you can guess, I haven‚Äôt been able to be on that for 2 months. Since the the coronavirus, I was laid off from my new job in March, and at first was doing surprisingly well. But for the last few weeks I‚Äôve gone back to depression, intense cravings, and anxiety issues. Ive maintained my abstinence from Kratom despite all of this until this past week. I bought some Kanna (mood supplement) from an online store, and they ended up throwing in a few samples of Kratom extracts. When I got this a few days ago, I panicked, but then felt relief. I had been on the verge of getting Kratom for weeks and here it was, just magically appearing! I took it that night, and felt nothing from it. The next day I went out, got the smallest amount of Kratom they sold at the local headship, and took all of it in one day. Again, I felt nothing. I thought, this is a blessing, my brain doesn‚Äôt respond anymore to Kratom I guess! So the next two days, no Kratom, no cravings. Then today happened, and it told me, just try it one more time, so I told my bf I was going to the pharmacy. He asked his usual ‚Äúno stops?‚Äù To make sure I wouldn‚Äôt stop to get drugs, and I said no. When I got back from buying some (again, the smallest amount I could), everything was fine for a bit. I took it, and didn‚Äôt feel much, and then went along my business. Well I left the trendy looking plastic bag they put it in out on the kitchen table, with a receipt of 16 dollars spent (no info otherwise). My BF came in hot, demanded to know what this was, I was a deer in headlights, just stammering and said CBD Store (true). He knew exactly what I did then, started freaking out, and asked me if I had already taken some. I panicked and said no, as I didn‚Äôt want him to be angrier. But then we he made me get it out, he could see that it was opened with a measuring spoon in it. He yelled that I not only relapsed but I lied to his face twice, back to back. 

The lying is what hurt him most. 
We are okay right now, we talked longer about it and I suggested we do couple‚Äôs therapy from an addictions counselor, which he‚Äôs open to. This won‚Äôt destroy us, but I don‚Äôt know how to make it up to him about lying. Honesty is everything in our relationship, we both value it so much. Kratom is the only time I‚Äôve lied to him. He doesn‚Äôt know if he can trust me, and I don‚Äôt even know how to trust myself right now. 

I have to get better, but I can‚Äôt seem to mend my brain. It‚Äôs so far into my addict ways of just putting a bandaid on everything. I have depression, anxiety, and some other issues, but I see a psychiatrist and therapist regularly. On my own I try to meditate (not very often though), I go on walks regularly, I draw and paint, I read spiritual and recovery books, etc. I know what I need to be doing but keep falling to my knees and giving up. 

God damn addiction. God damn mental illness. 

I feel so much shame and guilt right now, I don‚Äôt even know how to act around my bf.",6,"{'rona': 1, 'virus': 1}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.52364784}"

I've been reading the posts on here for awhile and it has in some way helped me feel less alone. My story is similar to many. I was introduced to kratom as a natural remedy for my anxiety and depression. I was diagnosed with both at 12 years old, and I am now 32. Anyone who battles with these demons knows that it can be a tough and lonely road. I was relieved when I found kratom. I didn't feel guilty when I took it, the way I would feel when I drank or did drugs. I thought it was my answer I had been looking for, but it has turned into almost a living nightmare. It's so hard for me to even write this. Kratom slowly but surely over the past 3 years has turned into a full blown addiction. For a while I was using just the leaf, but the kava bar that introduced me to kratom, sold and made their own kratom extract shots. Who even knows what's really in them. $15.00 a pop and sometimes it got so bad I would take 6 a day. I finally quit going to the kava bar but then was unfortunately introduced to OPMS shots. Then things got really bad. I take them everyday, generally 3-4 a day, just to function. At this point I don't even like the way kratom makes me feel anymore. It's just like a constant zombie like state. Does anyone have experience with the extracts and quitting? I want to quit so bad. I quit a while ago for 2 months, but then slipped up. The withdrawals were pretty shitty but I got through it. I'm more afraid than ever to quit because I am scared that coming off of the OPMS shots will be way worse than what I experienced before. It's robbing me financially mentally and emotionally. Any support and advice is greatly appreciated. Today I only had 1 shot, which is big for me. I just feel anxious and restless and blah but the truth is that is how I always feel now. I plan on tomorrow not taking any. I know I have a long road ahead of me. Reading your stories again helps me know that I am not alone. Thank you to anyone who reaches out to me. Sending love to everyone.

I've been taking kratom and etizolam for over 3 weeks.

2mg/day Etizolam for the first 2 weeks, then 3-4mg/day for the 3rd week.

Alongside that, I've been taking approx 6 grams of Kratom/day for the 3 weeks.

The last 2 days have been 6mg etizolam/day, and 8 grams kratom/day. I have tried tapering both drugs simultaneously, but I keep relapsing due to excuses that seem justifiable at the time. (I'm sure a lot of you know exactly what I mean). I have decided that I'm sick of prolonging the discomfort and I'm ready to get back to my old self as soon as possible. I have quit both substances in the past, but not cold turkey.

The question: Has anyone experienced quitting this combo cold Turkey? How bad are the withdrawals going to be? How long will it take approx until the anxiety/depression, and insomnia subside?

As far as I know, the doses of Etizolam I have listed are not ''seizure territory'', correct?

(There is one exception that I would allow myself, which is some Etizolam right before bed to get some rest before another day of withdrawals ensues. Is this a good idea or should I go completely cold turkey and ride out the sleepless nights to get it over with even faster? )

This is my first post to any type of recovery site. My long story short is my Kratom abuse has gone on over the past 4 years, only quitting when I got sick from how much I was taking (3 or 4 times over the 4 years). Yet, I always returned.

Each morning I wake up so nauseous still. I hold out until it feels like I can't deal with it any longer. I did have one day without any but the next day nauseous again.

I don't want to take this green crap anymore. Any suggestions. Should I just stop and deal with it, push through. Has anyone had the experience of withdraw lasting so long? Nauseous is my only symptom.

Thanks in advance for any feedback. I really appreciate it and hoping everyone reading this is hanging in there themselves dealing with this stuff.

Work every day feels like a bad dream,"I‚Äôve had to work at the hospital during this fucking pandemic. Every job in a hospital is an important one, but without going into detail, mine is really important. Once upon a time I needed some help with the stress of my job and home life... I have access to pharmaceutical drugs and that was really tempting. But I knew it was job suicide and, at the very least, damaging to my licensure and career. I found kratom instead. As someone who values evidence based medicine I did quite a bit of research, and the long history of use felt like pretty good anecdotal evidence of safety... Now, somehow, about 3-4 years has gone by. I honestly still loved the stuff to the very last dose... but, because of my job, the lack of safety data just never sat right with me and I made the decision not to buy any more as my last bag ran low. I understand pharmacology, so I knew there would be some withdrawal. But, my god, I had no idea it would be this. I should have found this sub in my research... I would have thought twice about buying any. I only found you guys when I started wondering if my experience was typical. And it‚Äôs just what was described in the FAQ. To a fucking T

All the reading I did before downing that first couple grams made it seem fairly innocuous. It couldn‚Äôt be anything like the addicts I see coming to the hospital destroying their lives for a chemical. Boy, have I been humbled. I can see why it‚Äôs easier just to do it again... and why so many people go that way. This is awful. I can‚Äôt sleep for shit and I‚Äôm tired all day. But I‚Äôm also pretty strong and have a lot of will power. I haven‚Äôt even thought about buying more. I won‚Äôt. Being completely sober sounds nice. 

That‚Äôs my story. Mainly I made this throwaway because I wanted to ask this question: does anyone get home from work and get comfortable, let an hour pass, and then think back over the day... and it seems like it was just a bad dream you‚Äôve woken up from? That‚Äôs what the last maybe 3 days have felt like. Things were already horrible. We just got past our peak from COVID-19, so the last several weeks have been dark anyway. But these last couple days have felt like hell on earth that could only be a bad dream. So glad it‚Äôs the weekend and I‚Äôm off. Hoping I‚Äôll feel halfway normal by the time I go back to the ICU Monday.

I woke up this morning in a fog (which I expected).

Normally, I would have laid in bed and reached for some Kratom to make me feel better. I would have turned on the TV, pulled out my laptop, and tried to work on something (half-assed I might add).

I pulled the covers away from myself, and the thought crossed my mind.

I could go down to the smoke shop a block away from my house, buy some Red Bali Kratom and get high, and lay in bed.

For a brief moment, it sounded nice. I could revert back to something that felt comfortable and familiar as a way to cope with dis-ease. 

But to my surprise, the desire left my body almost as quickly as it arrived. I began thinking about different ways to make myself feel better.

Instead, I got up, washed my face, made myself a healthy breakfast and took a 3-mile walk around the lake near my house. *What else was there to do?* 

The water was crystal clear this morning. A steady breeze brushed my cheeks, and the exercise brought my body back to life. 

A sense of peace washed over me. I felt proud of myself. 

*Real change moves slow.*

Transformation bends and stretches us in ways that aren't always linear and understandable.

This morning I caught a glimpse of it though. A glimpse of the progress I have made. A glimpse of the life I quit Kratom for.

I suppose we don't often realize the things we say *no* to when was say *yes* to substances. All of the experiences we don't have, the people we don't leave our house to meet, the walks around the lake we decide not to take.

It's crazy how fast an addiction to kratom takes hold. Took some time to sift through the BS about kratom being a harmless all natural alternative to prescription opiates. I don't know why I do this, I am smart enough to know what I'm getting into, but I did it anyways. Oh yeah, because I'm an addict.

I'm disturbed because rather than a proper taper I've doing a reverse taper (if there is such a thing) and  actually been taking more in anticipation of quitting. No doubt I've made it harder on myself. My first experience  removing kratom for a week or so I had about 3-4 days of acutes. One thing is for sure: I don't feel ready to quit when I escalate the dose like this. But I have no choice.

I'm quitting kratom because it's addictive and a myriad other reasons. (You can see my other post about the s***list on kratom). But it has to be now because I'm being recalled to work by the end of the month. So this is my last chance to get out. A lot of wise people on this forum have advised to quit while I'm ahead and so that's what I'm doing, I just need some encouragement and support.

I take capsules so I finally figured out exactly how many grams I use per day, and it's around 54. 90 capsules that are each 600mg. I dose three times a day with a tiny dose (maybe 8 capsules) in the middle of the night, because if I don't I wake up in WD and can't function for like 2 hours until it fully kicks in. 
I started a baby taper yesterday. I'm simply deducting one capsule per day from my daily intake. I'm hoping once I get down to a really low dose I can just jump off it altogether. I know that means it could take up t three months to get off this horrible shit but I know I won't be able to CT it.

I'm taking agmatine three times a day now, too, but honestly haven't noticed that it helps me take less or helps with the in-between times. At around the 6 hour mark when I haven't had any I'm still getting anxious and my heartbeat is accelerated.

So ive been addicted to both Phenibut and kratom before and have gone through some devastating withdrawals which lost me my job and a good friend of mine. 
On top of that i had a seizure infront of my mum from xanax withdrawals the same year. After that i got medical help and tapered off the lot. The taper took 4months and although it was far from painless, it was surprisingly manageable.

Even after all that pain, it only took me 2 months before i decided that i could get away with taking kratom again! How could i have been so stupid!
After that it didnt take long before started taking Phenibut daily aswel.

Its now been 4 months since then. Im on a daily dose of 3gs Phenibut and 10gs Kratom

Im dreading the withdrawals but I know i can get off them again as ive done this more than once now

The thing that i am truly worried about is how easily i turned to taking drugs again. Im so scared that im just going to repeat this cycle other and other again until all my friends and family give up on me. I hate this! I despise myself.

I guess what im asking is how can i stop myself from doing this all again

Sorry for the long post and thanks for any replies


Edit: Thanks for all the advice guys, its given me a great boost of confidence. I now feel sure that i can get through this. I have tapering schedule set in place which i have started today.

Been reading Russell Brands book and it been really helpful along with this community.

Here's a quote: ""The unmanageability here meant the negative consequences in my life were stacking up and importantly, once I start with drink and drugs I don't know when, or if, I will stop. The very act of drinking or using sets me on a course that I am unable to reliably arrest."" 

This happened to the last time I quit and started using again. I quit for 3,4 months then thought (stupidly) it was safe to use just a little. It was unmanageable for me and 'a little' turned into a entire year of using every day... The negative symptoms worst than ever.

Another quote, I think Brand said, from 12 step: ""First my using was fun, then fun with problems, then just problems.""

I know rationally that it just destroys my body, numbs me, destroys my skin, makes me a liar, makes me sneaky, makes me the worst version of myself.

And maybe that's the kicker, because it is JUST KRATOM. a stupid sludge you buy at a gas station. Fuck man, I hate this shit so much.

I just am so freaking terrified I'm not going to follow through tomorrow. My biggest fear is, how can I be sober? I hate myself, I do kratom to not have to deal with how much I hate myself.

It took me SO MANY tries to quit.  So much wasted time feeling sickly and depressed.  I was a chronic relapser after around the 4th day or so.

This time around, I'd just finally HAD ENOUGH.  I was wasting over a hundred dollars per week buying capsules.  I was switching headshops constantly so that I didn't look like a strung-out junkie coming back for more Kratom, when I had just blown through a bottle of 500 caps in 5 days.  I felt shitty on Kratom, and even shittier off of it.  I was sick of going through withdrawals every morning.  Of having to wait until my dose kicked in to start my day.  

When I saw money... I didn't actually SEE money.  I saw Kratom.  Every $20 bill was converted in my head to a specific amount of Kratom that I could purchase when the stores opened that day.  All of my thoughts belonged to Kratom.  Every goal I'd ever set was snuffed out by it.  Nothing mattered anymore, except for my next dose.  My habit grew in size until the ominous shadow it cast over me was inescapable.  I knew it had to end at some point, but I kept delaying that point by another day.  Another day.  Another day.  Then finally, I just took the plunge.

My acutes were rather weak this time around.  I'm not sure why.  Maybe it was my attitude towards the whole thing.  I suffered the usual symptoms - anxiety, sweats, wicked-bad RLS, goosebumps, and massive lethargy.  

Around Day 7, the insomnia took hold.  It still hasn't let up.  At day 29, the insomnia and bowel issues are the only 2 lingering symptoms.  I'm surprised to find that, despite being bipolar and having an anxiety disorder, my anxiety has dissipated so much from that first week that I feel back to baseline again.  I thought for sure that the anxiety would be the one symptom to linger longer than the others.  I was sure that is what would lead me to relapse again.  I can't believe it, but the anxiety was ACTUALLY WORSE when I was taking Kratom!  Nuts, right?  That's what I started taking it to treat in the first place.  

My life is infinitely better even a month after quitting.  My skin is glowing.  I'm running daily.  My waist has gone from being chronically bloated and painful, to tight and trim.  I have money in my account.  I enjoy my mornings without any chemical intervention whatsoever.  I have feelings again.  Real, legitimate human feelings.  

To anyone teetering on that precipice, wondering if it's worth it to make the jump... please know that it gets better.  Maybe not day-to-day, but each week is better than the last.  Stick it out, be kind to yourself, and realize that you are worthy of more than a life of indentured servitude to a plant.  If I can do this... anyone can.

Hopefully this can help some of you. As we all know, this journey is different for everyone. But I know I benefited greatly from reading the variety of experiences that many of you have shared. 

**#1 - Talk with your SO or a close friend/family member.** Telling my girlfriend was incredibly difficult, but honestly the best decision I made (along with joining this reddit group). She has been able to remind me of my progress, as well as help me through the most difficult moments I've had during this process. For example, I had what I would consider a panic attack 2 days ago (related to work issues and a variety of other personal things). It would have been so ""easy"" to reach for a dose of kratom to ease my burdened mind. Instead, my girlfriend was right there talking me through it and reminding me that I am not myself right now. I haven't been myself for a while. I found the strength to power through and it felt so damn good to know I took on that challenge without taking the easy way out. I know I'm kinda a mess right now, but since she understands what I'm going through, it feels so much more freeing to let my emotions come out as they may, as this is only temporary. 

**#2 - Avoiding things that exacerbate RLS (antihistamines/anti-allergy meds, caffeine, adderall prescription, alcohol, etc.).** Believe me.... the runny nose, itchy/dry eyes, and concentration issues aren't fun. But I will take that any day over RLS. Obviously you can't cut out all medications you might be on, but try to limit the things you are ingesting that may have RLS as a side effect (always consulting with your doctor if it's a prescription you take). I recommend reviewing anything you routinely take to see if it may have adverse reactions during this time of WD. I was taking allergy meds for a few days before I realized what they were doing. When I stopped, things got SIGNIFICANTLY better with my RLS. Also, something that has helped alot during sleep is putting a cold pack on my lower back. Not only does it help me regulate my temperature (I've been sweating like crazy), it also seems to freeze/calm the nerves that go to my legs. This ice pack idea came from my girlfriend. Another reason to talk with someone close to you, as sometimes you can feel so overwhelmed that easy tips and tricks are hard to find. 

**#3 - Reconnect with your inner child.** I have been playing games and watching movies that I loved as a kid. I feel it's important to return to the things that you enjoyed before life seemed to get difficult, and before addictions like kratom were even a thing. I find myself wondering what I truly enjoy these days, as many of my adult memories and good times seemed to occur when out drinking or dealing with an addiction like kratom. Remember that it didn't use to be like this. You used to have a life that didn't revolve around a substance. 

**#4 - Read/listen to self-help books.** I have really enjoyed The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle and Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. At first, reading was too difficult. So I relied on podcasts. But now that things have been getting easier, I can actually pick up a book and have the motivation/energy to read it. 

**#5 - Light exercise.** I've been going on walks and slowly building my stamina with mild-moderate intensity workouts at home. I used to workout on kratom all the time, but after quitting I felt like an old man (I'm 29). Seeing my progress every day has been a huge help, and it's helping me see that exercise does so much for mental/physical health. Relying on things you yourself can do makes you feel more in control and can help to eliminate/minimize things like anxiety. 

I know this is hard. And it's gonna be different for everyone. Try not to overthink what you're feeling. Sometimes my mind almost makes me experience the symptoms I read from other people. Listen to your body and try to figure out if what you're feeling is really what you're feeling. Distractions are important. If you sit on the couch and think about how terrible you feel, you'll likely be there all day. Try to keep routines, no matter how small. Hope this helps! And a big thank you to those of you who have helped me get through this difficult time.",18,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.7195659}"

But let's do this again. Day 7, the worst feels like it's over although i can't sleep without melatonin and my body aches and lethargy is bad, overall I have a positive attitude towards it this time, something I think that is crucial. 

I want to stop and I can see how much better my life is once I do, so it motivates me to stay sober. I have also stopped all other drugs as well, no alcohol no weed. Okay I am drinking a shit ton of tea and technically that is a drug, but for the most part, drug-free for a week. 

Every time I just kick the habit for a while, I foolishly look back to good times on Kratom and think, ""I am stronger now, I can have a dose every now and again, just as long as it's not every day, right?"" Almost definitely after I allow myself even once dose, it becomes a daily thing again, and all my life becomes is chasing a high. It's sad, but I have to face it, addiction runs in my family and I have an addictive personality, as much as I love who I am, I also know who I am and I am not going to give myself the benefit of the doubt in the future. It is over. I am over kratom, over drugs, I want to cultivate happiness and contentment for myself, even if I don't have extreme highs, its worth not having the extreme lows and depending on a drug just to feel normal. I am sick of this. I have quit kratom for good. I am concentrating on my passions and my career and exercise and good food and taking care of myself.

Constantly switching strains and upping dosage (up to 30-40 grams a day) until I got so rediculously constipated and nauseated daily, to the point of constant uncomofrtability!

During this time, and previous, I‚Äôve worn a heart-monitoring device (Whoop), and the data on my RHR (resting heart rate) and HRV (heart rate variability) is pretty astounding. 

TLDR: Kratom significantly raised my RHR (from average of 55 to 68) and drastically dropped my HRV (from average of 48 to consistently 20 or lower).  This data is measured during my last sleep cycle, which is the most accurate time to measure them.

Here is an article explaining HRV:

https://www.whoop.com/thelocker/heart-rate-variability-hrv/

Basically, you want your variability or difference in milliseconds between consecutive heart beats to be more different which gives you a higher variability or number of milliseconds difference. This means you have a healthy play with your nervous system and heart.  Ideally, your HR increases a little with every inhale and decreases a little with every exhale.  This means your heart and body have a healthy relationship with your nervous system/ fight or flight.  If your HR is more consistent, like a metronome, it means your flight or flight is taking over too much and your body is constantly in a stressed/ready state.  Having a higher HRV is associated with all major measures of health and encouraged through good sleep, nutrition, exercise, and other general health.  

My HRV was around 40-50 ms consistently before Kratom.  Within 1-2 days of starting to use a few grams 3-5x/week of high-grade maeng da from a reputable dealer, my HRV never reached above 20.  I also began to develop some chest pain by my left pectoral.  I‚Äôm a very healthy dude with no other health issues.  I maintained a healthy exercise regime, but did notice myself eating far less.  I stayed extremely hydrated.  

My RHR went from consistently 55 BPM every night to 64-68 BPM and was still increasing until I quit last week.  

Since quitting (4 days off) my RHR is already back to 55 (just last night) and HRV is up to 30 MS, but has taken time to recover.  It has increased slowly over the last 4 days from hovering around 17-20 with little to know change day-to-day, to now around 30, with more variance depending on how my exercise and sleep are.  My guess and hope is that it will continue to rise over the next week.  

I‚Äôm really glad I‚Äôve had a Whoop during this time because it is largely what motivated me to not fuck with this shit.  The negative health effects for me are too undeniable and do not outweigh the fleeting warm-fuzzies.  I thought maybe it could be a good way to manage neck pain, unemployment, and quarantine but damn.  I know there hasn‚Äôt been a ton of research on Kratom‚Äôs effects on the heart so figured I‚Äôd at least share my anecdotal evidence with y‚Äôall.

Edit- some words

Edit- I shouldn‚Äôt have titled this to assume causation by saying kratom‚Äôs effects on my heart.  All of my experience is still just correlative and not confirmed causation.  My apologies.",39,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.49792725}"

Not trying to pity myself I'm proud of how far I've come but still disappointed because I feel like I'm prolonging the inevitable.

Yesterday morning I took magnesium and some restless leg dissolvable is under my tongue and some l-tyrosine  And I did pretty OK. I also wanted to wait as long as possible because in a sick way I look forward to that 1 afternoon dose of 5 g that I get but now that I drank it already I just want today to be over it's very depressing and I don't want to feel like this anymore I don't want to rely on something to feel OK and I'm sick of feeling like a shell of myself.

Things are more stressful for me in the covid world. I miss going to the gym especially. There is something that clicked though. I've been tapering from 15g these past few weeks and finally got down to 6g a few days ago. But yesterday my sleep schedule got messed up pretty bad and I woke up with this extreme urge to dose which keeps happening from what I notice recently after a few weeks of tapering. 

I guess I just get tired of being in WD and want respite and to feel good again. So, the other day I basically took 10g of kratom. I lost control and got caught up in the moment. I felt like it was over and I failed again but the more I thought about it I realized that it doesn't have to be that way again, and again. I decided to just take 5g for the entire day today, no exceptions. I even feel like taking that 10g yesterday helped me get my rocks off. I even took some instant kava and ate alot of food and just tried to chill. I've been intermittent fasting too recently which has been helping me taper. 

So, for the sake of just cultivating a healthier relationship with kratom, which will be invaluable to me in the long run and essential to being able to taper off this time. Also, I realized that my tolerance isn't going to be affected too dramatically from just one day of taking 10g. So, if I focus today I should have no major issues sticking it out on 5g these next few days. This is how I've been failing at tapering..... I end up taking 10g or more and just get so caught up in feeling like an addict and failure that I repeat the same mistake the following day. Not this time. I will not waver and keep going down.

Everyone has a different experience getting off the green sludge, but to those of you who are tapering or planning on quitting soon, I hope this post helps.

My last dose was 30 hours ago after a relatively short taper. This was after nearly three years of daily abuse up to 150gpd as of recently. There has been a lot of sneezing, fatigue and muscle pain, but the benefits are becoming clearer. I feel a connection to the world and others I haven‚Äôt felt in years. Kratom gives you the illusion of feeling great, but it also dulls and numbs every experience, good or bad. Hugging your child doesn‚Äôt feel as good in Kratom. Seeing an old friend for the first time in years doesn‚Äôt feel as good. A nice jog on a beautiful spring morning isn‚Äôt nearly as great. Everything is numbed. I did not realize half of this until beginning to taper. I thought it was anxiety and depression. Sure, maybe part of it. But the VAST majority of my anhedonia, derealization, and emotional numbness was Kratom. I suffered mentally for years, thinking Kratom was helping me. Coming up with every excuse in the books to continue. Combining it with stimulants and suffering dangerous spikes in blood pressure. I became a jerk to people I love, struggling to express empathy or understand others‚Äô emotions. I was a zombie. 

I know I‚Äôm early in the journey, and that difficult days are ahead. I know that I will make a million excuses to relapse, e.g ‚Äújust for one time‚Äù, or ‚ÄùI really need to taper slowly again, this was too fast‚Äù. But much of this process entails realizing how better you are off this garbage. Life is simply more meaningful. Your experiences will improve.

I believe in every one of you. You can do it. Yes, it‚Äôs going to suck at first. But it will be worth it by far maybe even faster than you expect. No matter where you are in the process, greater days are ahead.",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.44723284}"

Day 23 No Turning Back No Matter What,"I was using Kratom everyday for the better part of 3 years. I‚Äôd say anywhere from 40-50 grams daily of good quality maeng da. I seeked it out after I saw a show on viceland and my addict mentality decided since it‚Äôs legal and relatively mild that I should give it a try. Mind you I had been clean from all opiates including suboxone for 2 1/2 years.. my first dose was bliss it felt like I just took a couple percs coupled with a crazy amount of energy and I bartend so this shit was perfect for my job. After about a month though it started to lose its magic and I realized I was just dosing to feel normal. Fast forward a couple years my tolerance became out of control, and I was spending 500 a month just to keep myself well. I wasn‚Äôt even getting high anymore.  Anyway I take signs from the universe and when the governer shut down my place of work put people on lockdown for this covid shit, I knew this was a perfect time to quit. I ended up going cold turkey cause tbh I don‚Äôt have the patience to taper. Anyway I‚Äôve withdrawn from a number of different opiates in my day during my almost 10 year off and on addiction everything from oxycodone to dope to suboxone. But this Kratom shit has been a different animal. Usually if I were to detox from a normal opioid, I‚Äôd get a cheap hotel for a week, toss and turn in a puddle of sweat with a puke bucket nearby but I‚Äôd snap back and be golden by day 6. I‚Äôm on day 23 on this Kratom withdrawal and this shit was strangely difficult. Which is odd because Kratom doesn‚Äôt give you that much of a high in comparison to all other opioids for the extreme low it throws you in when you quit. The acute symptoms during week one weren‚Äôt too bad besides the rls, lack of energy coupled with the relentless insomnia. My stomach also felt like it was turned inside out and didn‚Äôt have an appetite for 2 weeks. One major difference I‚Äôve noticed about Kratom withdrawal as well is that my body feels heavy as hell even 3 weeks later. some days I get this morning depression but weed has been a godsend for that along with many other symptoms and once I get up and get my blood flowing I feel much better. I still do have sleep difficulties which is expected cause I relied heavily on Kratom to sleep. I‚Äôd wake up at 5 am with that icy hot shiver going down my spine realizing I need to dose again. What a nightmare. The bright side is I‚Äôm starting to feel like a normal person again though. Kratom numbs the fuck out of you whether you realize it or not so I‚Äôm getting all of these emotions and sensations back and it feels amazing. Like I‚Äôll be on a drive and just get this wave of happiness while listening to a good song and life becomes beautiful again. Little things like going for a walk in the woods and breathing that fresh air feels fucking amazing again. For anyone trying to quit, when you‚Äôre down and out and sick as a dog going through withdrawals just know it‚Äôs temporary and IT WILL PASS. You‚Äôre gonna feel like absolute shit for a few weeks just realize your mind and body is playing tricks on you and this is not how normal sobriety feels. Your brain needs time to repair itself so take it easy, go on walks, drives, listen to podcasts, do whatever you need to do. You will feel a difference by day 15 and it only gets better by the day.

Financially: 

better get some magnesium citrate so i can shit properly! $5.99 

Better get some healthy probiotic supplements/raw milk because my gut is all fucked! $20.99

Better get some more tobacco while i enjoy my kratom high as it enhances both! $19.09

Physically: 

(After dosing) Wow i feel incredible today! Better run at least 8 miles off kratom to fully enhance endorphins! (Tears knees up from bad form but cant feel a damn thing because i'm high as a kite off kratom! And when the kratom has fully left the body, im left with pain that is really hard to push through and keep training, potentially sidelining me for weeks) 

""Man this stuff feels amazing"" (digestive organs start to ""sting"" over extended use and duration, but i cant feel shit because im high as a kite off kratom)

""I should cut back today as i have had bloody diarrhea for the past week from hemorrhoids from kratom. But i like the feeling so I'll keep using, never mind that i am rectally bleeding""

Spiritually:

""Wow this stuff feels amazing! I am so happy today walking in this field with the hot sun beating down on my skin"" *comes down rapidly and vicisously later that night, dark thoughts keep me up throughout the night, get 2-3 hours of sleep and rinse and repeat*

I am on day 5 after pretty heavy, daily use. I think most of the physical effects are tapering off (had some trouble sleeping last night, but not much). Mainly, I just wanted to reach out to see if I'm blaming my moodiness too much on the withdrawal. 

I have been more snappy lately. Most notably, I snapped at my girlfriend in a really harsh way about something I instantly realized was stupid. I apologized, but feel as if I lashed out because I'm just more unsettled mentally in general right now.

I feel better. I feel better every day now, but I'm hoping I won't have much longer to return to normal.

I quit around December of last year right before Christmas. I tapered from 12gpd to 3 and then jumped off CT after that. The withdrawals were very minimal. No RLS, no panic attacks, no sweats etc. Worst thing I got the first few days was back pain (likely due to an existing Injury). 

About 5-7 days after quitting I developed heart problems. I would have these immense dip feelings in my chest randomly. That gradually improved with time, but at the 1-2 month mark they started happening anytime I would work out. It feels like a fish flopping in your chest.. I went to the doctor and got put on Metoprolol. This eliminated 99% of the randoms but the workout Palpitations were still there. 

In January my mother passed away, and they came back again. I think it was just my mental state. Anytime I'd get into a passionate conversation or cry it would start flip flopping. 

I'm glad to say that as of 2 weeks ago the random workout Palpitations have seemingly dissappeared. I've only noticed one and it was very mild. Almost reminiscent of what they used to be. 

So I do believe they will improve until they ultimately dissapear. It's been a long 5 months of thinking I'm probably gonna have heart issues for the rest of my life lol. I'll update again next month, but anybody going through this trust me it does improve. Just takes time.",8,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44154322}"

At first I thought nothing of it. I decided to do it as an experiment and figured it was okay and harmless. I started just 6 GPD and only 3 times a week. From there it got worse and worse. For the past 8 months, I‚Äôve taken anywhere between 25-45 GPD. I was taking Bali. 2 months ago I went to the emergency room during my shift at work for feeling beyond dizzy and seizure like symptoms. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it.. thought maybe dehydration and anxiety? After researching up on Bali, I found this particular strand at high doses cause those exact symptoms. So did I try and quit? Nope. I switched strands. Same doses for the last 2 months with no severe symptoms. But now I think how much this has ruined me. Probably have spent around 4K dollars easy on Kratom in the last year. I was trying to train for a bodybuilding show but yet my diet is constantly fucked up because I revolve my eating around Kratom. So now I‚Äôve wrote a very long letter to myself on how it‚Äôs time to take action. Today I start tapering. Going to cut down to 15GPD. After reading a lot of horror stories about withdrawal I‚Äôve been scared out of my mind. I see people severely struggling and they weren‚Äôt even taking half the dose I was. So if anyone can send me thoughts and support on the best way to attack this demon, it would be much appreciated. I‚Äôve never had to withdrawal on any other drug.

Finally, the catalyst, my amazing, smart and beautiful girlfriend(now ex-girlfriend) broke up w me... I was very much in love w her and I still am... It woke me up.
It made me realize how I was wasting my life, wasting my money and how big of a loser I had been...I felt like a total failure. I couldn‚Äôt do anything without taking Kratom... And worst of all, I have been hiding it from everyone. And that was cutting me off from the people I love.

I am on day 7 of a 60 day taper. So far, it has been pretty easy. I am decreasing the dose by .5g every day. 
 I will prob jump a few days ahead, because I end up w several grams left over at the end of the day. Yesterday, had 4 grams left at the end of the day and I felt fine...  but I don‚Äôt want to rush it because the pain of withdrawal is what makes me relapse. But I am so ready to be done w Kratom.

I am currently on day 27 of CT from a 3 year habit about 15 grams a day. I have taken some breaks before, but this time I knwo I have to be done for good. I work a professional job, and Kratom has ended up making me such a zombie, just going through the motions, but having no real joy or passion for life like I once had. This time quitting was probably the toughest for me. Acutes the first week sucked, but not unbearable and once they were gone  I was able to sleep. Things got bad some time between the second and third week. Just horrible depression. Im currently living at home with my family right now due to quarantine and still working during the week. The depression and disassociation was nothing like i have experienced I basically stopped talking to my family for a week. It was a very uncomfortable experience for me and my family and it  left me with horrible guilt. Fast forward to the past 3 days and my mood is much improved. I can articulate myself SO much better now in conversations. Been having great workouts and am actually enjoying myself watching a movie with the fam.

I really owe a lot to this group. I checked posts pretty much every single day of this quit and everyones experiences and motivation have pushed me to keep going. So for that thank you and I would encourage everyone, no matter where you are with Kratom, to know that you are not alone and that many people have overcome this addiction. You can too! 

&#x200B;

One thing I'm struggling with, and would really appreciate any advice or perspective, has to do with hair loss from kratom. Im a 30 M and I feel like there was some damage done to my hair in terms of quality and maybe some loss over the years I used. I also should mention I have OCD, something Iv'e dealt with my whole life, and one of the reasons I began self-medicating with Kratom. Anyway, I just cant get the thought out of my head that even when I have healed from my Kratom use that I will always be left with hair loss to remind of how dumb I was for ever touching this stuff. Anyone been clean from Kratom for a while, but still struggling with hair loss that was caused by the kratom?

I‚Äôm a pretty strong willed person naturally, but Iv allowed kratom abuse and being undisciplined to totally disable my will power. I know what I need to do , and I know how it needs to be done , but the anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure) and psychosis has crippled my desire and ambition. For the past year , I literally feel like my feet are strapped to the floor and I can‚Äôt seem to get back who I am and where I was before . I feel stuck . It‚Äôs a very destructive and toxic cycle , I don‚Äôt even enjoy conversation anymore. Because I have to pretend to enjoy it , put a fake smile on my face and act interested. It feels like a knife Gauging my soul and I can‚Äôt wait for the conversation to be over , I‚Äôm literally just trying to get through the day instead of being in the moment . I know how weak and pathetic that sounds . I use to do stuff , I use to goto the gym and kill it everyday , maybe enjoy some video games , skateboard , etc. even on the kratom but Now I literally just goto work , and go home . It‚Äôs become so toxic . I‚Äôm starting to realize CT is the only thing to do at this point . I quit before , I felt on top of the world . But now it‚Äôs been 2 more years and the past year has been the most miserable and unproductive year of my life . I have a mild panic attack every night before bed , it all hits me at once . I know I‚Äôm being a pathetic human being and that I‚Äôm wasting my life and risking my future . I‚Äôm 23 years old and not where I would be if I just got out this hole . I really just need to break out of this psychosis  state . It‚Äôs hard to make the right decision every day when you don‚Äôt even know who you are anymore . I‚Äôm not blaming the kratom , I blame myself . I knew what road I was taking and I kept saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do better tomorrow‚Äù . All I know is Iv wasted 2 years of my life on this plant and I have to change it . There‚Äôs only two people that know about what Iv been going through the past couple years my mother and my best friend that‚Äôs been going through this even longer than me (which is how I found out about kratom) he‚Äôs doing A LOT better than me right now though . I‚Äôm at 50+ GPD and he‚Äôs probably around 15-25 GPD on average . 

I started taking phenibut multiple times a week for a couple months and thats when things really got out of hand . I only enjoyed the days I was on phenibut and then my kratom tolerance got boosted and one thing lead to another and here I am . I literally feel like I‚Äôm in a dream or in a trance . Reality just isn‚Äôt there anymore . Like I honestly don‚Äôt even feel alive , I‚Äôm just repeating the same day over and over , week after week. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs just the psychosis and anhedonia . I know a lot of people are going to just call me weak and pathetic (which isn‚Äôt incorrect because it‚Äôs not who I am , but it‚Äôs who Iv been lately)
It‚Äôs not like me to tell people my problems which is why only 2 people know about this battle and one of which is in the same fight . 

PS: Again I‚Äôm not trying to blame the kratom for my problems . I‚Äôm the problem , I abused this plant . It‚Äôs not the fires fault if you get burnt . I understand that . 

I just don‚Äôt know if I can think clear enough to properly taper at this point . Even if I do good all day , when it‚Äôs 7pm-10pm that night ,  I might end up taking 15-30 grams. . It‚Äôs just keeps happening , I‚Äôm not trying to blame anything or anybody else . It‚Äôs ME . I know that . I have to put my foot down . I have to be better and do better . I‚Äôm just trying to gauge opinions from experienced people if I should just say to hell with it and CT .",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.9218173}"

I took 50+gpd for 6 months until i was able to get surgery and quit cold turkey a week after. Nothing more than a runny nose.

Fast forward a couple years and I relapsed on some nasty substances. I quit the drugs (they weren't opiates\oids) and planned to substitute kratom to keep me straight for this first month of taking my life back.

This is where it gets funky. Its been one month of no more than 30gpd and I've decided my cravings and mental state are improved enough that I trust myself to stop the kratom without another relapse.

I cut it down to 15gpd, remembering that I had basically no issues stopping cold turkey the first time, and I'm having full blown WD. Sick to my stomach all day, very restless sleep, flu symptoms, sweats, etc. I've felt withdrawal from a lot of different substances in my short, selfish life of drug abuse, and nothing has been this bad for me. Not even breaking a benzo habit after months of heavy use.

I'm just wondering why the HELL this is so bad when I've been taking this substance for a fraction of the time and a fraction of the dose this time around. I'm trying to stay strong and stick to my taper, but as any addict knows, this is a horrible feeling for more than the physical side effects. I'm afraid the WD will push me to something way worse than the kratom and now I feel like I've got myself in a world of trouble.

I wish I just had the willpower to never relapse on anything again so I never have to substitute a ""safe"" drug for a ""bad"" drug. I will get through this, as I have before, and I know all the tricks and tips to WD as  comfortably as possible.

Reading your stories helped me. I like helping people and talking about myself so I hope I can kill two birds with one stone here.

 

On April 8th I ran out of kratom, a habit that had grown to... too many, grams per day over nearly two years. Quarantine was the perfect time to quit. Who knows when I‚Äôll get a chance to be a useless vegetable for a week again? I knew it was gonna suck. I‚Äôve gone a day and a half without dosing before and couldn‚Äôt handle it. I was not prepared for the hellish fever dream of my own creation I was walking into. There was a brick where my mind was supposed to be. Hours on my bed muttering ‚ÄúFuck fuck fuck this is driving me insane‚Äù. Couldn‚Äôt focus. Couldn‚Äôt even bother to distract myself. Maybe some Youtu- no it all sucks. Games? Start screens are cooler than the wall at least. Off chair and to bed for a few hours. Maybe sleep. Maybe give up and stare at my computer screen. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. I *hate* this. Fuck. Maybe outside?

Finally a moment of peace. The chilly spring night brings me back to my senses, I did miss the way cold dry air felt. The stillness and silence of the woods and stars, broken only by wind and windchimes, is comforting. Even near a city the stars are still wondrous little pinpricks on a vast blackness. Okay, it‚Äôs cold, time to go back inside. Hopefully I‚Äôll feel better.

Nope. Back to the same. At least a wink of sleep. The next day is better, less hellish. Existing is still the only thing I can do but at least it‚Äôs *easier*. A few more days and, one night, staring at the ceiling from my bed I realize I‚Äôm past the worst of it. The last few days are a blur and I‚Äôve got a long way to go. For the first time in... too long, for a brief moment, I‚Äôm proud of myself again. Kratom was never my only problem but, if I can get through *that,* then maybe I am strong enough to work through the rest. It‚Äôs still not easy, but compared to the first days of withdrawal the self-doubt self-hate anger frustration, and despair all seem... smaller. Next up is the truly hard part, working every day towards being something I can be proud of for more than a few minutes.

To anyone out there going through the same: You already know how hard it was or is. If you‚Äôve made it through even one day of withdrawals you are more than strong enough to beat this shitty green powder for good. You‚Äôre not weak if you relapse, it wasn‚Äôt a fuckin‚Äô cake walk to get to where you are now. You‚Äôre not alone. Go out there and kick kratom‚Äôs stupid teeth in. 

Stay safe out there. World‚Äôs more nuts than usual these days.",8,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5712251}"

 It explains SO MUCH why. Even mentions anxiety, panic attacks, lower back pain and yawning and other symptoms we are always moaning about here! 
Even loss of muscle mass.


For me the breath thing became troublesome late quit stages. I was puzzled it remained even sans anxiety cuz I thought that caused it. Nope!

I am a heavy user, but I can't go on like this. My family knows, and I've been snapping at people. I know how this plant affects me negatively, but the trade off is my work ethic and the results I get on it. I've been prescribed adderall, which I really do not like. It makes me a robot. 

Bottomline, I am planning on quitting after a rapid taper this weekend and then jumping off next week. 80gpd.

I've has periods of complete sobriety (not drinking or using any substance) for up to 18 months. I had periods of drinking and or pain pill use in between. It's now been over 2 years that I've gone back to daily drinking in the evenings and I've abused the Fiorect w/codeine that my doctor prescribes for my tension headaches on several occasions. When I heard about kratom I thought it could help my chronic headaches. However, after months of taking it I feel more and more depressed and unmotivated. Then when it try to stop I get unpleasant physical and mental withdrawal symptoms that eventually make me give in to feel better. It reminds me of heroin withdrawal in a way but not nearly as bad. I honestly feel like it has stolen my personality! I don't even know who I am anymore and I hate myself more and more everyday. I have no real emotions anymore. I can't offer any interesting or substantial conversations anymore. I can hear myself talking to my husband and thinking at the same time, you sound like an idiot, why should he love you when you hate yourself? I have no motivation or energy to do anything. I have plenty of time during quarantine but I can't seem to push myself to do the things that would give some purpose to my life. I'm completely failing as a wife and mother to my soon to be loving, sweet, smart and thoughtful daughter.

They have no idea this battle I'm fighting within myself because they have no knowledge of my kratom addiction, only my past struggles with legit known drugs. I don't have anyone to talk to because no one really knows anything about kratom and I feel completely embarrassed that I got addicted to such a thing because it's not even illegal. It's not like when I used to go to AA and NA and could really talk to people that understood where I was coming from because they had been there. I don't know anyone else that can relate. I'm the only person that knows what I'm struggling with and I can't seem to dig myself out of this huge hole I've created. If I continue on this way, I fear I will lose my loving and affectionate husband of 3.5 year (11 years together) because he already lost me months ago and he deserves so much more. Not to mention my daughter needs a mother that will go outside and play with her, teach her to garden and bake and do science projects and everything else to stimulate her brain and raise her right. I am NOT okay! I want myself back because this is not me!",29,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.85246766}"

I'm about a week in and it's going well. Not sure why but my symptoms are quite mild this time around with one exception. I have constant drainage that just stays behind my nose and drains making me nauseous. I can't blow it out of my nose because it's like too far down. Anyone have any experience with this? Should I try Flonase?,1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.56261414}"

My habit has been about 20-25 gpd for about 6 months.. i uaually do two drinks per day. Yesterday morning i had my usual 10g in the morning, but come my night dose i said fuck it and i havent had a drink in almost 24 hours. I was going to go ct but now im thinking ill do 10g again today and maybe e tomorrow..then 5 for a couple days..then jump.. idk bc ive never tapered before bc i usually cant control myself once the drink is made and in the fridge (i make 100g at a time in my crockpot and put it in a gallon jug)..this time i feel in control bc im the cliche ""sick and tired of being sick and tired"" but my legs are terrible rn and i have this knot in my gut and its hard being able to relax thru this bc i have a 5 month old baby girl.. in wondering what will be easier.

His personality changed quickly, within a day or two. He became more snappy and short right away. He was laying in bed a couple nights in telling me he's worried I would leave him during this because of the personality change. I assured him I wouldn't. Two days later he was laying on me in bed squeezing me telling me how much he loves me, saying I'm his best friend. The morning after that we were talking about our next trip to Mexico, at noon that day he started getting cold personality wise. That night he wanted nothing to do with me and the next day after I got home from work, he broke up with me, told me I needed to leave and that he was unhappy for a long time. I tried talking to him but he wouldn't listen to reason. He believed he was thinking clearer then ever and this is what was best and he took his daughter and left to his parents for the weekend and left me and my daughter with no where to go and nothing. We were planning on forever together so I gave up my house and got rid of most my stuff and we blended together. It's been a week since and he is still cold and not the same. I truly believe he has PAWS and anhedonia and is not thinking straight and blaming me like I am the reason for this new found depression. One thing to note is he was not sleeping at all. Maybe 2 hours a night. I think at that moment he had slept about 4-6 hours in 3 days. 

Before he stopped Kratom, he was Mr. Perfect. I never once thought we would split. We had our moments of being human, but truly nothing detrimental. Just days before this we were talking about how nice it was that we didn't have any big issues with us and how we could always work through anything. He was so loving and reassuring and there was nothing hinting to this becoming an outcome. I know that I know that he loves me to his very core, but in 36 hours time he went from calling me his world to a sudden switch to anger without an argument or provoking, and decided we were over and seemingly thinks I am the problem and the only reason he was with me was because the Kratom blinded him to our issues and then he ended us.

I know in my heart that this is not the real him. I know this is caused by the psychological withdrawal symptoms and major dopamine crash in his brain. Has anyone else reacted this way? He is normally so uppy and full of life. Playful and flirty. He was the type of guy who loves attention from his woman and never treated me like I was an inconvenience or a bother. Even my family was shocked when I called saying he broke up with me. They even know this isn't a trait of his. It's been about 10-12 days since he stopped taking Kratom. He stopped taking it last summer but went back on after a month or so because of the depression. But all he seems to remember is how the physical effects were back then, not the depression that followed and reason he started again.

In broken over here and hoping that he will start to normalize and remember how much we loved each other and correct his mistake.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4810881}"
