I always CT, but I am trying a taper this round. Jumped a week back, but just couldnt handle it, probably the kindling effect.

Made it 5 days then went back, just as I was about to make it through acutes. The thing that got me was the depression and anxiety (mental withdrawal), which never happened before this severely (and cravings). 
Made myself a taper plan which I keep messing up, right now i'm on a high dose and still can't sleep (according to my plan I was supposed to take half of what I took just now). I definitely feel that every withdrawal is worse even if I took less and for less time. 

I'm not excatly sure but kratom actually causes insomnia in me suddenly. Also rapid heartbeat, shallow breaths (anxiety). Im fed up with it.
Does anyone else on a taper have insomnia? How long do you wait after dosing to go sleep? And do you take less or more than previous daily doses or is it the same dose?

It actually worked great as a painkiller for 1 month, then it got real bad as i got more dependant on it. I had my fingertip amputated after it got crushed and was in pain all day for some time. 
I also thought about using it responsibly and occasionally but I just can't do it.

It feels to good to me. Like a pair of old slippers, next to a warm fireplace. I just can't be bothered when i'm high. 

Tomorrow morning I will give tapering another shot and if I cant do it I will just CT again. I have supplements, vitamin C and CBD if it gets bad. Just wishing for some real rest, not this kratom induced crazy hazy foged-up shitsleep. 

I wish myself the best and everybody out there who is dealing with addiction.

I‚Äôve been lurking on this sub for almost a year and can‚Äôt tell you how much I appreciate everyone that posts and comments. I sort by new and read everything. 

I found kratom over four years ago when I was in a pretty terrible head space and had resorted to Googling phrases like ‚Äúlegal highs.‚Äù  Kratom showed up on some list, I ordered some out of desperation, and it worked. I was able to calm down at night (which I desperately needed) as well as keep me churning through work during the day. 

Now here we are four years later. During this time, I‚Äôve been using kratom 5 or 6 times every day, often skewed heavily toward nighttime, probably 40-50gpd. I am thoroughly sick of it. It‚Äôs embarrassing where I bring this stuff, where I dose this stuff (gross dive bar bathrooms, my desk at work), but most import to me is the hiding and lying. I have a great family, boyfriend, friends, and I want to stop. 

I tried tapering (which kept me from going in the wrong direction), but it wasn‚Äôt happening fast enough so I had my last dose Sunday night (3 days ago). The first two days were manageable. Right now, I feel a bit shit physically. I‚Äôm a little achey, have diarrhea, and am dealing with RSL, but it‚Äôs not horrible, horrible. 

No specific questions for the group. Just saying hello and hopefully someone that desperately needs something to read will find this, just like I did. 

I‚Äôm planning on keeping myself involved in this sub, hope to meet you all soon.

I quit. I just dumped the rest of my stash down the drain. It was easier to quit last time when I had to drive for 45 minutes or order it online to get more. But now the gas station two minutes from my house has all you could ever want so it‚Äôs so easy to relapse.

Currently in my life I have so many catastrophic things going on. I am an orthopedic trauma worker so even during this pandemic chaos I am having to work unbelievable hours and so that raises my stress and need for energy.

I just got a letter in the mail yesterday... the night before my wedding I bought one of my groomsman a hotel for the night and he hung his suit from what he drunkenly thought was a coat hanger but it was the fire line and ended up causing $214,000 worth of damage and the insurance company just serve me yesterday saying I am responsible even though I have never been in the room. He claims that he will take responsibility and I do believe him but it‚Äôs causing unfathomable stress.

Last year my wife and I tried to flip her house using her name because she has almost perfect credit and we took out a loan. We only used $13,000 of it but I am not a wealthy man and when the contractor robbed us and purposely destroyed massive amounts of the property it left us $13,000 in debt which has an annual required pay back in 16 days. That may not sound like a lot of money to some of you but to me it‚Äôs everything. It will likely make us go bankrupt and will destroy my wife‚Äôs hard work her whole life to get such a good credit score and will take away our dreams of having a house and getting out of this apartment. Everything in me says that I need Creighton right now but I absolutely have to get off. I need all of your support.

Also I talk to my lawyer today and there is no way that the hotel damage will stick to me but they are still pursuing us very aggressively and it is extremely stressful.

Lil history - Started kratom in October last year, I went from a 30+ gpd habit to straight cold turkey 2 weeks ago tuesday.

Day 6+7 was where I started to feel like these tiny bits of positive vibes trying to squeeze their way through. And every day since then I haven't felt ""bad"" exactly but not ""normal"" either.

Quit CT Feb 15th (75 days!) from 6-8 years daily mod-heavy use.  I am FEELING so much more human and myself again, which is incredible.  However,  I have broken into a CRAZY RASH that is not going away.  When I search on here I see a lot of reports of people's skin clearing up when they quit, however, I'm experiencing the total opposite and can't really link this to anything other than my quit and probable hormonal disruption?

It started as a small, red, scaly, itchy burny spot on neck.  After a couple of weeks of applying topical steroid, it erupted into what looks like acne all over the front of my neck and chest (lots of bigger deeper ""pimples"" and lots of little red bumps).  That was mid March. It itches and burns and I went to the dr and they claimed it's likely ""anxiety"" related but gave me more topical steroids/antibiotics as well as oral meds.  Needless to say, it hasn't cleared.

SO, my question is, has anyone else experienced their skin freaking out after the quit? If so, did it eventually calm down?

Some GOOD NEWS, I was losing CLUMPS of hair every day for years and as of this past week IT HAS STOPPED!!! So I guess maybe I'll at least have better hair even if my skin looks like garbage.  :/",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.51643044}"

The WD's that you experience are personal to you and somebody else might be having a completely different experience when quitting Kratom because everyone's body is different.

Occassionally I make it a day or two without then I cave again. Let me preface with I'm not ready to try tapering yet. Maybe I should, but it's not what I want to do yet. I really am sorry if that's shitty to say or something, but I've always been more all-or-nothing. But I could just be in denial.

Anyways, I've recently been getting back into exercising. Mainly jogging, yoga (mainly kundalini style, a lot of physically demanding poses), and general stretching several times daily. The endorphins are obviously helping me feel good naturally and I'm hoping that this could eventually give me an edge to help quitting. The other day after my first run in a while I felt so good and relaxed. I didn't even think about kratom until 9 PM that night, which is very uncommon lately. I usually will think about it all day until I take my first dose, ideally after 6pm or later if I can will it. I have this idea that maybe if I wait after a few weeks of getting back into shape that maybe it will make it easier to quit the kratom or even just not use it consecutive days. I've never taken kratom as a pre-workout, mainly because I work out earlier in the day and I find taking anything earlier in the day guarantees frequent redosing until I go to sleep. However, I have taken it before bike rides and it gives me way more stamina. I am wondering if I maybe should try using it as a pre-workout since I'm already taking it daily anyways. It also softens how strained my body can feel post workout. I would probably just start working out later if I went that route. I don't want to dig myself deeper doing that, though. That's why I'm sharing my thoughts, obviously. I dont want to use it with my workouts if it's going to make working out harder than it was before I started using it as a pre-workout tool. Like, ideally I would like to make the best of a situation I'm already in and then once my Fitness level is a little better try kicking the kratom again. I know my thoughts are a little scattered and this probably sounds like a dumb idea to many of you. Feel free to tell me if you think so.

I want to get off of this shit. I really do. Maybe I don't want it badly enough yet, but I'm hoping at least reaching out on this sub can help to get me going in the right/a better direction. I've only been running for a few days  and it is significantly easier to not even think about kratom thanks to all the natural feel good chemicals my body makes as a result.

Just to preface, I'm a 30 year old woman that's dealt with alcoholism and kratom addiction, having quit drinking when I was 25 and quit Kratom in December. 

I was doing really well with this whole ""stay at home"" thing for a couple of weeks there. Then the boredom and loneliness set in in full force. I've dealt with depression most of my life, and it was finally letting up for a couple of months, partially from being clean but partially because my psychiatrist added a new antidepressant to my regimen that seems to have been actually working. Well, the familiar feeling of extreme boredom set in last week, where I felt like I was going to burst any second and yet nothing sounded fun (different than just normal boredom, it's like a panicky boredom), and for the past 4 days it's been a downward trajectory with depression. Even before these emotions I was dealing with craving issues, but now that I'm getting in a weird head state, the cravings are absolutely incessant. I was just crying in the bathtub trying to read a drug recovery book when my boyfriend came in to see if I needed to talk. I told him about the intense cravings, I mean he went to hell and back with me during the last bout of my Kratom addiction (we met while I was on Suboxone after a 3 year Kratom habit, so I was fairly stable, but not out of the opioid woods, so to speak, and turned back to kratom after my Rx ran out), so the last thing he would ever want is for me to do is relapse. Despite us having an absolutely wonderful and healthy relationship, my addiction issues almost cost us our relationship. I would never want to lose him. So why am I even entertaining the idea of going back to Kratom? All I can remember is the first great year on Kratom, where there were all upsides, rather than the 4 years after with all downsides. 

I've talked to my therapist about these cravings, and she says I just need to distract myself. But what if the cravings are 24/7? What if it's not just a passing thought? 

I've been thinking about it and I think extreme loneliness may be part of these cravings, which that realization took me to write on here. I don't have any friends here, we moved a year ago to be near his family temporarily, and they were my only social interaction. Nowadays we have to stay away for the most part due to his dad being in a vulnerable population.  I do talk on the phone sometimes with my sister or parents, but that's a once a week kind of thing because I honestly hate talking on the phone as it makes me anxious. I'm one of those people that has a lot of social anxiety but wants social interaction more than anything (which makes me a perfect candidate for drug and alcohol addiction!). I make friends easily but getting myself to put myself out there is the hard part. My job was helping me get the needed social interaction out of my system for a few months there (I only got the job in January), but I was laid off with all of this. My bf keeps suggesting ideas of what I can do, like volunteer to talk to elderly over skype, but everything sounds anxiety provoking to me. God  I hate that I have social anxiety more than any of my issues.

Anyways, I had to get this down, thanks for reading, and I hope to hear from some of you that may relate. Who knows, maybe that will alleviate some of these feelings. I just need some damn relief.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.52493584}"

However, after reading all these warnings and some horror stories about kratom withdrawl, I became so afraid of stopping/taking a break from my Kratom use that I continued using it for months after my body and mind were telling me I needed to take I a break. I had to function for family/work duties. Having these withdrawl symptoms I'd read about plus/including rebound anxiety/depression was not an option. So, while using kratom wasn't doing anything for me, except keeping me from these withdrawl symptoms so that I could function(as I was telling mysel), I Had to keep using it...or so I thought.

What a wonderful resource this is for anyone trying to get away from this plant (or other pharmaceuticals) and get help and support. 

A little about me: I‚Äôve been addicted to most all opiates. I‚Äôm 36 and stared in my early 20s with good old Vicodin. The yellow 10s. I still remember the first pill and how it made me feel. All the bad washed away to a warm comfortable bliss. Then onto oc. Then graduated to the next terrible opiate because it was way cheaper than ocs and stronger too, which eventually brought me to my knees.  Then it was suboxone off and on for years.  Those withdrawals were anything but fun. 45 days of acute followed by months of PAWS. But it was absolutely do-able with a long taper. Still miserable, but you make it through somehow. 

Gabapentin withdrawal, on the other hand, after months and months of throwing 10 to 15 800s a day down my throat, was the most horrendous, scary, lonely experience, I‚Äôve never forgotten a minute of it. With opiate withdrawal I felt like I was dying, GABA withdrawal on the other hand, I was legit suicidal. It was 15 days before I could even come out of my room and be in the light, and forget about driving or going to crowded places. It was as if my brain just stopped. I couldn‚Äôt wash dishes, take a shower, make myself meals. Thank god I had my husband to take care of me and our German shepherd, or I likely wouldn‚Äôt have even fed the dog.  I had no feelings, it was numbness all day, no love, affection, just anxiety and days and days of what felt like an endless hell. 

Not everyone has Gabapentin withdrawal, but I‚Äôd say many people do. 

Now for Kratom. I don‚Äôt have a ton of experience with it, but I have taken it recently for about a month to assist with some anxiety and depression I was having due to the current situation we are in with corona virus, and I will say it helped. It never got me ‚Äòhigh‚Äô, probably because of the other opiates I‚Äôve taken over the years, but it helped. I‚Äôve been taking it daily and will stop when I feel ready and it‚Äôs time. I know I‚Äôll go through withdrawal, so I plan on using it short term and probably doing a taper when I‚Äôm ready. Again and this is the important part, I know what to expect somewhat and I‚Äôll be prepared with anything I can to assist me. 

But, I had a thought this morning and hoped it may help someone. 

The above things, suboxone, Gabapentin, oc, Vicodin, all can be tapered pretty effectively with dosing fairly consistent. 

With kratom, I think the difficult part is, not all kratom is the same. Not all bags contain the exact dose per spoonful. You could get one spoonful one day that is stronger or weaker, depending on the alkaloids in it. You could buy the same bag the next month from the same vendor and it may be a little different. 

You may be purchasing from a gas station (been there), a smokeshop, a decent online vendor, or a great online vendor with excellent track record. All kratom isn‚Äôt the same. 

I think that‚Äôs where the difficulty is. 

So, while someone‚Äôs kratom taper may be easier, or harder, keep in mind all kratom isn‚Äôt the same. All kratom withdrawal isn‚Äôt going to be the same. 

If a taper works for you with kratom,  by all means do that. In my opinion, I would think this would make it much easier. However, keep in mind tapering off will be difficult for the reasons above. 

If your a CT kind of person, then do that. 

Also, if using Gabapentin to come off, just be careful. The above post isn‚Äôt to scare anyone. It‚Äôs just to inform you. Taper the Gabapentin also.   

If you had anxiety and depression before kratom, or insert any substance here, you may have that again and it may now be worse. 

If a Doctor is recommending Suboxone to get off kratom, do your homework first. If the Suboxone is going to keep you off ‚Äòhard‚Äô drugs, by all means. But, you will eventually have to go thru Suboxone withdrawals down the road. 

In my opinion, going from kratom to Suboxone is something to be carefully considered. As someone who used Suboxone for a long time, and also for short periods, I personally wouldn‚Äôt do it. But, everyone has different situations, work responsibilities, family obligations, etc. that need to be taken into account. 

I hope this post helps those using Gabapetin and also those considering Suboxone. 

Just be careful with anything you do. Always research. Advocate for yourself. And if you think you need to see a Doctor for antidepressants or anxiety help, by all means do that. 

Use this board for help. But don‚Äôt compare yourself to others saying I should feel better by now. You‚Äôll fell better when your body does. There are so many factors. 

I will say this and read this twice: quitting right now will be the easiest and hardest thing you do. It‚Äôs hard not being able to leave the house when all you want to do is get out and do something, even though you feel awful, the option is still there. Right now, you can‚Äôt really go anywhere. So, your stuck inside thinking about how bad you feel. Get outside and get some exercise if your life and health allow. Get some exercise, eat well, take vitamins, and stay hydrated. There‚Äôs no magic pill or cure, just time unfortunately and once you have some acceptance of where your at, no matter how shitty, it will get better someday. Accept the feelings, and take the good with the bad. 

And keep pushing. Because we are all fighters and badasses, most people couldn‚Äôt go though half of what we do and still keep going!",7,"{'rona': 1, 'virus': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.41238505}"

I just wanted to share my experience so far. I've probably been taking close to 50gpd for 4-5 months, never used opiates. Usually I'd take two rounded spoonfuls (bigger than a tablespoon) at least, sometimes 3 of Red Bali powder. I just took it until I felt good and stopped when I would feel motion sick. Not good. Checked into the ER after several days of constipation not getting better. Instead of stopping, I continued with laxatives. That should have been it, but I kept taking it with diminished returns until finally accepting that it was an unsustainable habit, and did a rapid 5gpd taper for a few days and cheated the last one. Bought another 150 cap bottle after, wiped it out in two days and just felt it was time to be done. This is day 3 CT and I can feel normal GOOD emotions returning and physical discomfort waning already. I don't think this will take as long as I thought and I have no desire to touch the stuff and reset my progress. Things are getting better more quickly than I expected.

I'm definitely feeling extremely shitty but that's to be expected I guess. Depression seems to have improved slightly today if only by a little bit.

Short story long, Jan 1, 2019 I told the my wife about my then almost 2-year long K usage. I laid out why I got hooked and my plan for detox. Being the amazing person she is, she understood, because I made a mistake and fell for the ‚Äúit‚Äôs just like coffee!‚Äù bullshit, and she helped me through detox. I swore I was done with it. 

Four months later, my wife had to have emergency surgery and that scared the shit outta me. My brain wouldn‚Äôt stop thinking that I could lose her, which I couldn‚Äôt handle. I found an old stash in my backpack I had forgotten all about and that‚Äôs when relapse began. My usage was off and on, with periods of extreme to very little. I spent thousands of dollars on this stupid shit, and because I wasn‚Äôt happy, I bought other things that I thought would make me happy. Basically, I don‚Äôt know how to just be happy! Hell, half of all this shit is still sitting on a credit card to this day, and I‚Äôm slowly selling off the shit I bought that I thought would make me happy just to pay it off!

So why the hell did I relapse? Simple: I suck at stress and I don‚Äôt know how to shake the internal voice that‚Äôs always telling me I‚Äôm a horrible at everything. Being a husband, being a father, being a student, etc. I couldn‚Äôt live with the fact that I was slacking off in home duties and my wife and her family were having to pick up that slack. I wanted to be somebody who could show that they could handle all the stress of going back to school and keeping up with my responsibilities as a husband and father and to seem mentally tough, but all the while not let my family know I was internally messed up, and to try to act like I wasn‚Äôt stressed, I was happy, and I was involved. And I didn‚Äôt want to mess up my kid like my parents did me. Basically, be who my wife and kid wanted me to be, all the time. K helped me do this to a point, but then it had the opposite effect of changing who I was. I did all of this just so I could get through a tough college program and become a member of the healthcare workforce. All that wasted money on green dust and useless stuff. What a stupid price to pay for a degree. 

Fast forward to today, and I‚Äôm now hooked again. This is my 3rd time trying to quit on my own since this lockdown started. I had 2 successes but relapsed for reasons that don‚Äôt matter. I want to come clean with her. About EVERYTHING. She deserves that. But I am terrified she‚Äôs not going to be so understanding this time and leave me or give me the boot. This time I knew what I was getting into; it wasn‚Äôt an accident. Most importantly, I broke something sacred in a marriage: trust. If I were her, I don‚Äôt see how that would be forgivable. I never thought I‚Äôd be this guy who fucked up so bad from something so stupid. I love her and my kid so much, and it kills me inside to know that I failed them both. I just wanted to be the happy father and husband they both need and deserve. To silence all the shit and nonsense that‚Äôs going on in my head all the time and just be a normal fucking person! I can handle the shittyness of withdrawal (I actually deserve to go through it at this point), what I can‚Äôt handle is the shame and embarrassment, and disappointing those that I love. 

So why haven‚Äôt I told her all this time? For what I thought was a logical reason. Because she‚Äôs always got more and more stressful shit being thrown at her. I didn‚Äôt want to add to all that. It was my mistake and I thought I could handle it on my own. Clearly I was wrong. Any advice out there for how to go about breaking this to her?",10,{'lockdown': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7987218}"

Got Ativan there and went straight to an outpatient facility where I was prescribed gabapentin for the rest of my withdrawals. But little did I know gabapentin has it's own symptoms of withdrawal (similar but not equal to Xanax). Ended up going back to the doctors again and again to get more so I could focus on being sober and just worry about this later. 

Three months ago I was flipping out at work because I'm a recovering addict and I need a fix(gaba isn't a narcotic and doesn't bring me any sense of euphoria) or I flip out at least once a day like a baby. So I ended up having some drinks. My friend found out that I went out and drank again so he suggested kratom for when I am in jonestown.

2020-04-26 18:15:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/g8nqdp/my_story/,My story,"I am a new poster in this group and Reddit in general. I have been reading the posts off and on for the past few weeks as I am taking the time during the ""stay-home"" to taper down on Kratom towards quitting.  My use started a year and a half ago. I used everyday for a few months and it had rapidly progressed to a 15+gpd habit. So I quit in the winter (when work was slow). But then I relapsed the following spring when work picked back up. My main use was for work as I work outside landscaping/construction -the days can be brutal and it helped me ,at first, to make the day more bearable. A side benefit was it eased anxiety/boosting social confidence. I thought I had found my miracle cure. 

An important part of my backstory is that I have struggled with substance abuse and depression/anxiety for my whole adult life. I had largely kicked the substances (mostly alcohol) 4 years ago and had made a lot of positive momentum in my life (good relationship, good job, even going to school part-time for some longer term goals, patching things up with my family etc.). I was a mess when I finally decided I had to quit drinking-rehab and AA helped me get through that first couple of years and with help from loved ones I rose from the ashes....And then I found Kratom. I had been dabbling in psychedelic therapies (from a truly healthy place) and so I had the idea that plants were an automatically benign tool to help me cope with my anxiety/depression.  

But ,in this case, with this plant, I ended up wrong. I have almost lost my job, my relationship, and most importantly I feel terrible about my self. I feel like I make a couple of good steps forward in my life and then I got myself hooked on this crap and here I am sitting on my couch feeling like shit because I am tapering fairly aggressively. I am feeling a lot of shame and regret for backsliding into something else that may take some time to really kick for good. I hear all these horror stories about folks going on and back -off Kratom for years. I don't feel the same resolve that I did about alcohol and that has me worried. I mean to say, I want to quit and this is a convenient time to quit but I don't have the ""I hate this stuff-I'm done"" emotion. I'll have to be back at work and so I need to get this over with. I have gone from a 30 GPD habit for about a year down to about 8 GPD over the past 3 weeks. I am thinking that I will go CT here in the next few days.

The worst part of kratom for me is this feeling of weakness / vulnerability that shows up mostly during the comedown. Usually I come off a bit intimidating to people or slightly off-putting when I'm not engaged with them, but when I was using people seemed to be 'see-through' me in a weird way. As if my boundaries were gone -- I had trouble defending myself emotionally. It was terrifying tbh.

Aside from being a little tired from the lack of sleep, I feel pretty normal.  No depression or anxiety, but i never had issues with either.  

I've taken magnesium glycinate and even Restful Legs for RLS that i got at CVS. I don't feel like either does all that much. On day 1-2 the magnesium seemed to help but not any longer. My three things that have helped me through have been exercise, weed, and coffee. I used to be an avid runner and weight lifter so jogging has helped me but also even just a few seconds of lifting weights or doing push-ups all the way until muscle failure (meaning you can't do anymore) helps a lot to loosen the muscles. Smoking cannabis has helped through the mental part. Whenever I felt wds, I would light up and felt that I could handle it better. Also I know a lot of people that are against caffeine while quitting,   especially those with anxiety, but when I felt fatigued coffee would level me off and I was able to work and concentrate better.

I've noticed a good amount of improvement now on day 6 with zero krtm. Just hoping to get a full night's rest within the next day or two hopefully. I'm already noticing the great benefits of not being attached to that little green powder. I'm starting to feel and think more clearly. I don't have to always carry some around with me whenever I go out. All of those sensations that have been suppressed due to the affects of krtm are coming back. I feel more in touch with my emotions, music sounds better, even sexual desires are starting to come back as they had been suppressed for about a year. 

I've been addicted to painkillers multiple times in the past so this process is not new to me, but never gets any easier. Like many people I thought kratom was a safer alternative to opiates. Boy was I wrong. What's worse is I don't feel like the euphoric feeling from kratom is all that great compared to regular opiates, but the withdrawals are just as bad IMO. I hate being addicted, I hate withdrawals. In the long run, it's never worth it. Being able to function properly and not having to rely on any substances to get through the day is bliss. I've made it this far, you can too. Good luck everyone!",3,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.81723374}"

While I‚Äôm very happy about this, I didn‚Äôt think my craving for alcohol would come back with such a vengeance. I am an alcoholic and had like 6.5 years clean on that until I quit kratom. I binge drank for about 3 weeks straight after quitting K. Of course my husband knows I‚Äôm also an alcoholic so he caught on pretty quick and while I was able to hide it except for a couple of nights, I got so wasted on Thursday that I almost hit my head on a door while stumbling around in front of my 11 year old daughter. I feel so awful about that. Yesterday she asked me if I ‚Äúcould not be crazy tonight‚Äù. Ugh...Today is day 2 of no alcohol and I slept so well last night and felt really good today. 

I opened up to my AA sponsor about everything and had to announce myself as a newcomer to my home group. I‚Äôve just been keeping so many secrets for years now I almost don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôm lying anymore. My husband and I have had some tough talks, I‚Äôm hoping he won‚Äôt leave me before I can earn back his trust but I‚Äôve put him through so much, I can‚Äôt really blame him for being at his breaking point. He said last night ‚Äúis this what the rest of my life will be like, wondering if you‚Äôre drunk, back on kratom, checking receipts, going through your stuff? I don‚Äôt know if I want that‚Äù. I am going back to complete basics, one day at a time. All the future tripping and stress/anxiety about all the life stuff happening right now is doing me no good clearly.

So, even though it seems obvious, I do not recommend using alcohol to help you when coming off kratom. I wouldn‚Äôt say it made me feel worse than the k withdrawals, it did give me a few hours of relief but then the next morning I was just dealing with withdrawals and a hangover. I‚Äôd sit on the couch counting down the hours until I felt it would be acceptable for me to start drinking again.

I have been wanting to quit Kratom for over a year and haven‚Äôt been able to conjure the motivation. Every time I try I end up buying a batch because I can‚Äôt take it. A little background I have been addicted to opioids for twenty years. I still use, and have been to rehab even. Since discovering kratom I use prescription meds way less. I make a lot of excuses for my use but probably the most legit one is withdrawal. As a functioning addict I work full time and support a family of three. I also am in school right now. I am solely responsible for 30 employees as well as being present and responsible for my family. Many times I have taken time off to withdraw and just couldn‚Äôt handle it. My daughter needing me, my husband, work calling for issues, running a household, doing errands and chores, school work. I just feel like I don‚Äôt have the luxury to be out of commission for a few days and feel insane for weeks on end from anxiety. That being said, I do want to stop. I notice a ton of negative side effects. Over the last year when I quit smoking cigarettes I have gained 40 pounds and my activity levels and diet hasn‚Äôt changed. I really think the kratom is causing the weight gain. I waste money on this crap that could be going to my daughter. It jacks up my skin. Sometimes I feel overly agitated from it. I‚Äôm not getting the same energy boost that I used to. Dizziness and lightheaded. Constipation. Low sex drive. I went to the dr because I was concerned I was getting kidney disease. My blood work looked ‚Äúnormal‚Äù but other stuff came up like fibroids and kidney stone. My dr doesn‚Äôt know about the kratom but I have reAd that it can be bad for kidneys and hormones and that could it explain the recent dr visit. I clearly am not on any kind of death wish- I hustle to have a good life. I just think I need to figure out how to get off this crap and still maintain what I gotta do. My question is how did you find the motivation to stop and how did you do it? I don‚Äôt know if I have enough self control to taper but maybe that would be a better bet for me then going cold turkey and not being able to fulfill my responsibilities or go to work etc. thanks for reading!

So I‚Äôve been using kratom for about 2 years daily. At this point I‚Äôm going through a kilo per month, so about 33g a day, I know, this is a lot. I‚Äôve been meeting with a doctor with a plan to get off it and he wants me to get on suboxone but to do that I have to go through WD for a week which starts in 3 weeks and I‚Äôm terrified. A week of WD is so scary to me. He prescribed a blood pressure medication to help and mentioned giving me ambien to help me sleep but I can‚Äôt imagine doing a week of not having any kratom. Has anyone here gone through WD that can offer any advice or help? I went through it for a few days once but that was after only taking it for a month. So 2 years now will be hell. No one I know gets it and tells me to get over it but I‚Äôve heard at the amount I take it‚Äôll be as bad as any normal opiate (which I know kratom isn‚Äôt actually an opiate) Any advice on how to get through it would be super helpful",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.72887117}"

I went from 40 gpd down to a pinch of kratom in the morning, and a pinch before bed (the first two nights I woke up halfway through the night and needed a 3rd pinch to fall back asleep. But after two days of rapid taper, I slept all the way through and cut that out).

I've now kept this pace for a week. I dont have a scale, but when I say pinch, I mean a quarter of a teaspoon of kratom. So I'm easily under 5 gpd. Probably more like 3 or 4 grams. Maybe less idk. Anyway I like saying pinch better haha.

Either way it's been a week and I feel SO MUCH BETTER. It was a bit tough, especially pushing all day without any doses, besides that pinch in the morning. But after 4 days I didnt wake up in a panic anymore. I always woke up in kratom panics, for two years now. 

This morning I took a normal poop. Yesterday I exercised (which was tough to get going but once I started I was fine. Try jogging. It's a very light excercise).

Next I will cut the morning pinch of kratom and only take the bedtime pinch. Then I will cut that at some point.

Idk I appreciate this sub.. it helped me a lot when I was going through the tougher part of the withdrawals. Now I'm at the point where I need to work towards regaining natural energy and motivation (that's the main reason I used Kratom especially for work). I can tell it will be a hard road because all I wanna do is sit around. But it is mind over matter at this point, considering 90% of the physical discomfort has now subsided through this week of that very rapid detox.

As everyone else seems to say here, and they arent lying - ya'll can do it. One way or another. There may be some discomfort. Some more than others. But you can get through it if you push hard enough. I pushed so hard at one point through my withdrawals that I literally pooped in my pants. No joke. How about that shit....... LITERALLY.

God bless us all. He wants to see this hard path of quitting kratom bring us closer to Him and His grace.

Keep in mind that if you are able to do a slow taper (maybe 30 day program) I truly believe there would be little discomfort through the journey. Maybe make it a 60 day if your dosage is very high per day. 

Disclaimer I was able to stay with my brother through this week of suckiness, and he helped me immensely. If you have someone strong in your life who you can lean on - take advantage of that. Not everyone is so lucky. God be with those who are alone in this fight. And I promise that if you look to Him for help, you will find down the road, that you weren't alone.

Fast forward a few years later, when I'm 23, all the time flew by. I spent all my money on Kratom at this point. It was Kratom before food, even before cigarettes which blows my mind. I headed toward a downward spiral and had to quit my job because social anxiety got the best of me and it was getting worse as Kratom wasn't helping as much as it used to. I take it to feel normal these days. I'm 25 currently. What I want to confess is how much of a fucking piece of shit I am. I borrow money from family/best friends (I do pay them back.)

The fact that I can already feel a major difference makes me so much happier that I tapered quickly (1 week) and made the jump.
Will update as the days go on but if there‚Äôs anyone who‚Äôs questioning quitting, don‚Äôt be afraid to go for it. If you want minimal WDs, taper and just do it. It is SO worth it knowing you don‚Äôt have to depend on a substance to get you through the day anymore, and constantly looking at the clock for when to take more to get what‚Äôs only a good 15-30 minute euphoric feeling. Life has plenty of those, and we will only ever get the best out of the natural highs in life when we‚Äôre sober and in complete control of our emotions.

I am now on suboxone so I‚Äôm not ‚Äúsober‚Äù and this isn‚Äôt a get clean post.

I just want to say, I have hair loss in my family. And I‚Äôve been slowly losing some hair since I was 19, but I still had a good head of hair for most of my twenties. Anyway, I‚Äôm 33 now, and the last couple years it got so bad in front I shaved my head. Helped a lot with the emotional aspects.

But in January I got off Kratom and switched to suboxone.

I have been on propecia, hair loss mes, for a year, so that may be why... but it did not start working until I got off the Kratom. Since I got off the Kratom, my hair has gotten so much thicker. It COULD just be that the propecia took a long time for me, but usually it works within six months. But when I got off Kratom, so much came back.

I personally believe it does cause and increase hair loss (almost half or more of all men and women experience hair loss as they age.) But if you want to know my opinion, a 6 year long daily Kratom user,  it does increase hair loss. 

Just something I thought I would share.

Congrats to all of you clean folks out there. I envy you. It sucks i moved to subs, but this is just about the hair loss involved with Kratom.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.57547474}"

Reading everything months before making the jump and every day since has been my support and drive. Thank you all!  Personally I tried once to take the powder and couldn‚Äôt do it. I can‚Äôt swallow pills so that was out too. Unfortunately my choice was shots and a sip here and there became 2-3/day for two years. I tried Kratom to jump from a 6 year codeine habit. I was chewing pills all day, every day.  After two years I knew I had traded one addiction for another and needed to stop. I read so many posts from people who feel so much better by 6 days, 8 days, 10 days and I‚Äôm so happy for you but for me it‚Äôs been quite different. The first few days of CT weren‚Äôt bad, I was just exhausted, yawning constantly and sweaty. I thought for sure I was one of the lucky ones. Wrong! Day 4 hit and I thought I would die. My entire body hurt so bad for days, there was no escaping it. By the second week even taking a shower/bath seemed like an impossible task that I had zero desire to do. As quick as the body pain hit me, it was gone. It was as if someone just turned it off on day 9. I thought maybe I was through the woods and heading out any day now. Wrong again! The diarrhea, hot/cold flashes, rls, sneezing, yawning, zero motivation and no appetite lasted 20 total days for me. From day 21 until day 30 I still felt rls and just today I‚Äôm getting some energy. I definitely wish it was more but I‚Äôll take what I can get. Other than energy/motivation, I have zero symptoms. Luckily the one thing I didn‚Äôt have an issue with was sleep. I slept 8-10 hours per night from day one. I was a quarantine quitter due to my shop being closed and honestly that first week I called every shop within a 30 mile radius. Now, you couldn‚Äôt get me to touch it if you paid me. I wanted off this train a long time ago but didn‚Äôt have the courage to do it nor the confidence. Luckily my boys are 12 & 13 and too busy fortniting and tick tocking to notice anything going on with me besides just thinking I had the flu for a week. The last thing I want is to discourage anyone, you can see on here we‚Äôre all different in how we react and handle withdrawal. I just wanted to throw this out for my people who are having a bit longer of a struggle than others. What I used: Women‚Äôs one a day vitamins and gabapentin 300mg 2x/day, 4x/day the first 10 days. I stay close to this page because I need all of you. 30 some days is great, I know, but I also know it‚Äôs nowhere near enough for me to personally say I‚Äôve beaten my addiction.

I‚Äôve set it up so the earliest I could get more kratom is 6 days from now if i ordered today. So here comes the suffering. There might be one business in town that‚Äôs still open where I could buy some and, admittedly,  I‚Äôm angry at them for selling kratom! The temptation of going to their facebook page to see if they‚Äôre still open just adds to the difficulty of quitting. And adds to the shame of me feeling that I‚Äôm weak.

So much of my shame is caught up in my kratom use. And I know the kratom use is just a defense I‚Äôve used to keep from feeling that shame. So, when I stop using, all those feelings come crashing in. ‚Äúwhy am I like this?‚Äù ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt I be better?‚Äù ‚Äúwill I ever be the person I want to be?‚Äù ‚Äúam I worthy of being healthy, content, and loved?‚Äù ‚Äúwill I ever truly like myself?‚Äù

I've read so many posts, i could almost recite them all. N my biggest thing with quitting, n believe me i want to quit, is that i feel alone. My mom knows of my problem, one of my four bros know. I have put my family thru it... i was a borderline addict in my marriage that ended in 2016, u turned to alcohol real bad before it ended n when it ended i went full bore. I ended up staying with my ex bro inlaw n my payment for rent was half of my script of 10s. I got 2 duis during this time n we both graduated to h. He was real bad on xanax too, i just drank... all the time. I ended up with anyerisum n that helped me quit the h. I got it from infection i got from the needles. I go thru 2 surgeries n a pill addiction n i got to a place where i quit drinking n got off pills. N i would of never guessed that i would do that. I've had the emotional baggage of my marriage. I have 3 amazing kids that i want to be clean for. I finally have close to a life back n i went n fucked it up with kratom. I did the usual thing just wanted something natural but its spiralled on me. I was going thru 2 kg a month. I started to notice that i wasn't doing as much n i honestly have wanted to quit, but Idk how intentional my slowing down was. I got to a place where i take about 2.5 lil white plastic spoonfuls 2x a day. This virus makes me scared to keep going on with kratom. I don't want to get sick n be on this. I can't take this into a hospital. I've talked to some  who i work with about my problem, 2 mainly. One a former alcoholic n another young man that's understanding. My thing is i have come pretty far without the world knowing n i just want to quit without losing anything else but the habit. Ive got a script for lyrica 300 n i have to say that ive already gone thru this month's script. I think I've been using the lyrica to slow down on the kratom. I just get super dehydrated from taking the kratom, just like i did with the alcohol. I believe that I've come so far that i can do it. I believe i do need a counselor or meetings to combat the behavior. Bcuz i am proud to of quit drinking n taking pills but to be where im at is totally disheartening. I believe now would be a great time to quit with being off of work bcuz of the virus. I just want to be free of this... I've been looking up supplements but really looking good bcuz i don't want to replace it with another addiction. I believe it is mind over matter. Before this, i smoke cigarettes n drank coffee. That was it. I had put the others to rest... but not the behavior. I still have 150mg of lyrica, i went from doing 900mg for a week to nothing, mainly with the help of agmatine. It really helped. N ive gone without the lyrica, why not just stay off it. I only have it to try to quit kratom but a week after getting my script, i don't feel the same force. If i can get off the alcohol n pills n i mean 2yrs between that n the kratom. Go from doing 2kg a month to whatever 5 plastic spoonfuls equals... n doing 900mg of lyrica to nothing with agmatine. I can do this. I know I need some kind of aa or na. But i just want to know that im not alone n i don't want to push away those i do have cuz i don't have many left. N mainly, i want to be free of this for my kids. I want to be able to help them in the future. Im begging... pleading that God helps me like he did before.

I had no idea what I was in for. I have detoxed off everything over the last 30 years of using. I thought k was pretty harmless because it was legal and gave me a pick me up. 
This first few days cold Turkey I was completely freaking out losing my mind. I didnt know what was wrong with me because this is my only time using kratom. I googled and suprisingly found this thread and realized I was in wd. 
I was a complete basket case for 2 months.  Extreme panic, terror. Depression. I went days without sleep. I was suicidal.  I could only hold negative thoughts. Gastric distress. Whole body rls.
These symptoms slowly have subsided but I'm still depressed.  I cant find joy in anything. I dont want to leave the house. I'm wondering now if I will ever completely come out of this.  
I was clean for 8 years until relapsing in 2012. I was very happy and productive during most of that time going to AA a lot. And taking an antidepressant daily. I wonder if i should get back on them? I'm afraid they wont help. And Im afraid to go to doctor.

I'm just curious. I've seen studies that say it helps mitigate the withdrawal symptoms of opiates (like 50-100mg, sub-plateau ranges), and that DXM is an opiate that does not attach to opiate receptors, which is confusing to me since it has similar effect of being a CNS depressant, but then again it doesn't quite FEEL the same to me as say, kratom or codeine or something.

I recently relapsed on kratom for the last twoish weeks and am looking to go CT before I get into the bad withdrawal range there and dxm has helped me in the past I think (will take it for a few days) but if it's basically just an opiate and is cross-tolerant with it, then I may pass.

     The first week sucked it from the back. Not gonna lie. I took large quantities of Vitamin C, DLPA and Magnesium everyday. Didn't seem to help at first, but does help after taking it for a couple days to get out of your head a bit. I didn't sleep for a week. Just micro sleeps for an hour or less because my body was sleep deprived. When I did sleep, the dreams were off the chain vivid. I even had a dream I was buying crack cocaine üòÇ. I've never once touched that stuff much less know what it looks like, so there's that lol. RLS is a SOB and so are the sweats! My body was oozing for a week it seemed, disgusting. That was the majority of my sleep problem. Melatonin and sleepy time tea is definitely a savior. Didn't really eat, had to force food down my gullet. Didn't poop solids for a while due to being so constipated for years. DO NOT TRUST YOUR FARTS DURING THIS TIME. Had Zero, 0, naught energy to do shit. I barely had the energy to get out of bed to use the bathroom or shower, but I did unwillingly. Your emotions will come back with a fury. I was crying about everything. Didn't ""feel"" depressed, but was a tear jerker for a while. I surprisingly didn't have any cravings, none. That being said, I WANTED TO QUIT. My mind was in the quit 100%, that definitely helps.

     Week 2. Most of the same. Sleep started to get better. I was taking 10MG of Melatonin to sleep plus sleepy time tea. Could start sleeping more than 2 hours at a time. RLS is starting to give way... Thank God. Gave up on quitting vaping just for some relief, but didn't really give me any. Started eating everything I could get my hands on. I was eating constantly. When I quit, I weighed in at 148 lbs..... I weighed 196lbs when I started over 3 years ago. My body has some catching up to do for sure and I understand. Started forcing my self to go outside and just walk laps in the yard with my music on. Was able to walk a mile without knowing it. Definitely helps being active to get out of your head and think about something else for a change. At the end of week 2, I started getting everything ready to move(car and trailer loaded with all my stuff). It was tough and was taking a lot of breaks during it. Just lost interest very easily. That applies to everything I would do. Not much interest has returned in anything. I am usually a busy body so this is an internal battle for sure. 

     Week 3. I was able to drive from SC to Central CO(1600 miles) with a lot of discomfort. My entire body hurt from sitting so long. I couldn't sleep in my car for more than a couple hours. Tossed and turned. No RLS. Some night sweats remain, but barely. Sleep is returning to normal now that I am able to sleep vertical with out the help of sleep aids. I'm just able to fall asleep normally(yay). I am still eating everything and can't keep enough food in my house lol. My mind is in a better place. I'm laughing for the first time in years. I'm feeling emotions I haven't felt in years. Crying at sad videos.... Wtf lol. Not like me at all, but it is nice to feel again. The worst seems to be over. I'm in good spirits, I didn't go back to drinking like I thought I would. My only addiction is 3MG Sad Boy cookie butter vape. Love the taste mostly. 

    So there you have it. Sorry it's so long, but figured I'd share my experience to help others on this same path. It helped that I quit my job before hand. I wouldn't have been able to do it otherwise. I used the quarantine to my advantage and as should anyone in the same mind set as I was. Now is as good as time as any.

I used it until summer 2017 at about 30gpd tossed and washed. 

I quit then for two reasons: one, because I had entered a new relationship and my dick didn't work, and two, because my family (who had known about my usage) finally helped me/made me quit. 

I did well for a while, then, a day before graduating college (which was three weeks before I moved), I relapsed. This kickstarted a very short period of abuse that lasted until February of 2018. I kicked it on my own then, and landed my first job in another city (but it didn't start until June). 

The night before my gf and I moved (in June), I relapsed again. The kratom helped me through the move, and once I got settled in at the new job/city, I quit again, this time lasting until about May of 2019...when we moved again. I relapsed again.

After I got settled in to the new job location/city AGAIN, I quit AGAIN (bear in mind, this has all been a secret from my gf/family since Feb. 2018)....and I just relapsed about two weeks ago...because we're moving again.

MOVING IS MY TRIGGER.

Obviously, moving is stressful enough as it is, but especially now, we're planning a cross-country move, neither of us have jobs (we have money though), and all the downtime from the quarantine has left me bored out of my skull.

I've already noticed myself being a dick to everyone again, but I've managed to keep my use under wraps thus far.

I did have one slip up January 10th that I have not shared here yet, but I jumped right back on the wagon so to speak. 

I wanted to share some positives I guess. I saved enough to buy myself a new tube amp for my guitar playing. While I was on kratom, I never had any money to spend on new music gear which is my ultimate passion. $10 saved adds up very quickly. 

I have released an album and a song since quitting, with everything coming from my heart and soul. People are starting to connect with my music and it seems like I'm building more of a following. It seems like the more I connect with the world emotionally, the more it connects back. I would post my music but I kinda want to keep this anonymous so when people google my music they don't see all my posts in here. If anyone wants to hear it, hit my messages I would love to share! A lot of my music is about becoming sober and I even have a song that talks about the pink cloud lol. 

Sometimes the world hurts. I am not perfect, I do drink a beer every now and then. I don't know why but I do. If I fuck up again, I will try again. This isn't an ideology but more of a life journey. I am thankful that I'm relatively young (22 now) and figuring this out. Feeling the world is a powerful tool.",3,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.67318875}"

I've only been using kratom for about two or three months, but my use escalated quickly to something like 25-28g per night. For a while it was only occasional use or smaller doses, but then I started using kratom to fall asleep, which meant I kept taking higher and higher doses to achieve the euphoria and sedation

I genuinely love kratom but I know I have to quit sometime, and probably sooner or later. I let it get out of hands and when my depression and OCD consumed me, kratom gave me a way to fall asleep, to feel better, to have a friend

Anyway I had been using the 25+ grams for the last few weeks and my tolerance built up crazy fast, I'm realizing now how badly I need kratom at this point because I've had to cut my use to 10-15grams the past few nights (my psych prescribed gabapentin for insomnia and it hella potentiates kratom; even taking 15 grams down I felt literally like I was gonna die or forget to breathe). Right now I just feel gross as hell and super weird in my own body

the point is, I have OCD and the obsessive thoughts aspect of PAWS scares the shit out of me because I don't want to deal with my mind, honestly. I know I got myself here but my intrusive thoughts genuinely stress me out so fucking much

If I did a regiment where, for example, I did one week at a time doing 20g per night, followed by 17.5g per night, followed by 15g per night, followed by 12.5g, followed by 10g, etc. decreasing by 2.5g per week like that, is it realistic to expect a minimum of PAWS? Since I've only been doing it for two-three months, would spacing my quitting out over time like that lead to there being more problems and dependency than it's worth? 

I'm earnestly wanting to quit so any advice would be helpful. I hate the way I'm feeling",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7975307}"

Stopped December 2018-may 2019, felt great! Connected with life and loved ones all over again, got my sex drive back, could think more clearly. Then, got back into the booze, and wasn‚Äôt long before I started using kratom to cut back on my problem drinking. It was only a couple short weeks before I was back to 40 g per day. Since then I‚Äôve stopped and relapsed 4 or 5 times. 

This last period of use was only about a month, but the RLS and fatigue are driving me nuts. I did a rapid ween (2 days, very rapid), jumped from 40g to 20g to 10 g. Monday was my first day clean, so I think today will probably be the peak of the WD.

Yesterday, I found out that my cousin killed himself. Counterintuitively, I think this is helping me not relapse today. As soon as I found out, I started bawling, and it instantly hit me that I wouldn‚Äôt have felt that if I was using. I would have been numb to it, and the pain would have been buried in me, along with a sense of guilt and shame for hiding from it. Also, every time I think about using, I just think about how much everyone is hurting from this lost, and that if I keep down the path that I was on, it‚Äôs very possible that I could bring that sort of pain to the ones I love.

Anyways, I‚Äôm grateful that I have supportive parents, food/shelter, a girlfriend who is helping hold me accountable by holding onto my money, an awesome therapist of 9 years, and a lovely community of folks on reddit that help support each other through kicking this nasty habit.

Firstly I have read through so many of these posts and have found this is an amazing supportive  group, so thank you in advance for your kind words and support. It has helped a lot understanding I am not alone in my loss of sleep! I just need some advice on how long it takes for sleep to normalise and what helped you the most to overcome this horrible symptom.

I have taken kratom for around 3- 4 years I did stop for around 6 months after about a year but returned to it. I used to take kratom 3 times a day morning afternoon and bedtime. a slightly heaped teaspoon that got bigger as time went on. I suffer from back pain and was on tramadol for a long while while I had Physio on my back. I now do yoga and have strengthened my back and improved myself so no longer need pain meds or Kratom. 

I stopped Kratom 14 days ago and have been through the physical withdrawal and have suffered from restless legs and insomnia from the start. I had a small amount of diazepam left over from a back injury and took this the first few nights to help get some sleep. But since then have not really slept properly at all and have only taken herbal remedies like Valerian and Ashwagandha. Let me be clear I have no craving for Kratom, I now crave sleep.

During the day I am fine apart from the mental exhaustion of not sleeping, you know the constant fizzing in your brain from lack of sleep. I am trying to exercise more , to the point where the dog hides when I get the lead out. The trouble starts when I go to bed, I had a bath last night with relaxing oils and took valerian. I lay there and the tingling arms and feet start up and I just cant fall asleep. Sometimes I am just on the edge of sleep but I never really get there. I tell myself well at least you have rested. 

Day 13 (last night) I took a small amount of Kratom less than half a teaspoon, I was asleep instantly. I am so annoyed with myself for this slip, I was desperate for sleep. I can take any physical pain but the mental torture of no sleep I find so hard, Especially when I know the phone will start ringing soon with a busy work day ahead! ( I found an old empty bag that had a tiny bit left in case you were wondering)

I have an important Job and luckily I am working from home so this is the only opportunity I wall have to beat this without turning my life upside down and taking weeks off. I am determined to do this and beat it but had no idea this sleep issue would be so bad. I understand this is my own fault, so I wont whine on about this, I did this to myself, I fried my brain with green sludge and now I got to pay!

But any advice that may help me sleep or help my brain to recover faster would be greatly appreciated.

I tried to ‚Äúrapid taper‚Äù before and it made me feel just as bad as trying to CT. Take 4-7 days between drops and don‚Äôt drop more than 10% at a time unless your dosage is so high you can afford to drop a little quicker at first. If you don‚Äôt give yourself enough time between drops, you will start compounding withdraw from subsequent drops and it is HORRIBLE. Listen to your body, you will know when to drop again. And remember that taking more wont make you feel any better. I think it took me 4 years to finally understand that. I will admit this is all advice I found on here doing lot‚Äôs of digging, but I just wanted to reiterate it because it actually worked for me.

I‚Äôm not only quitting because I‚Äôm tired of taking it every day, but the worst thing has been the chest pains I‚Äôve gotten these last few months. I was hospitalized 3 times about 5-6 years ago for panic attacks, I have a high anxiety issue and Kratom was one of the things that helped me with them. The last two weeks on Kratom I was having so much anxiety once the Kratom wore off, and I just didn‚Äôt feel right. Like my body was starting to reject it. Now, as I‚Äôm tapering I‚Äôm noticing that my anxiety is through the roof. I went from taking 20-30 gpd to about 10, 8, now I‚Äôm stabilizing on taking 1 gram every 3 hours because of the anxiety and the feeling that my skin is crawling. I literally can‚Äôt calm down. I‚Äôve tried potentiators like turmeric and curcumin with black pepper and agmatine sulfate to help but with the dosing but they don‚Äôt do much. I‚Äôm also taking magnesium, ashwagandha, and turmeric capsules every day. I don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre helping a WHOLE lot. I ordered St John‚Äôs Wort, L theanine, GABA and garlic pills along with some fish oil and stuff for the heart cause the chest pain has been my biggest fear but those haven‚Äôt came yet. I‚Äôm attributing the chest pains to anxiety but I‚Äôm so tired of waking up every day and feeling like I can‚Äôt control myself. I don‚Äôt have a primary care doctor and I‚Äôm a 34 y/o female. I walk 3 miles every day and I eat healthy. But the past three days I‚Äôve been drinking a shitload of wine just to help me calm down and that is the ONLY thing that helps. But I don‚Äôt want to depend on that to help me every day. Is it because I tapered too much too quickly? I was afraid to keep taking larger doses anymore cause it was causing me so much anxiety after it wore off and I hate the chest pains I feel, and since I‚Äôve tapered the chest pains have greatly reduced. I just literally don‚Äôt know what to do about the anxiety... it‚Äôs the most awful feeling. If I were to quit cold turkey how long would symptoms last as far as anxiety and the rls? I just want to be done with this but I‚Äôm so afraid I‚Äôll go into full on panic mode. I‚Äôm taking about 4 grams a day now, so I was gonna stay on this til I got my other vitamins and see if in a week I can lower my dosages out enough to where I don‚Äôt physically need them.

Became easier w/ klonopin but agreed with my MD for a very small amount and measured intake. Thanks to this thread I am armed with supplements and vitamins.

starting using alcohol heavily at night to deal with the horrible RLS ... 
Stopped and cleaned up , tried kratom and loved it .  Used it once a week - then got pregnant and then stopped everything long term.. 
Was miserable but fine, RLS were horrible but  magnesium helped .    
Stopped for almost a year and half ... then started kratom again and quickly became a daily user.

I‚Äôve been stealth-reading this subreddit for awhile now, hoping to absorb some of your motivation and insight by osmosis. I‚Äôm finally making my own post here in the hope that I can motivate myself and commit to quitting this drug that‚Äôs taken over my mood, my bank account, my motivation, and my physical health and well-being.

I‚Äôm a recovered alcoholic and haven‚Äôt touched booze in over a year now. I don‚Äôt really do AA with any consistency. The secret to my semi-long-term sobriety? Kratom. (Yeah. Real healthy.) I haven‚Äôt been ready to admit to myself that I haven‚Äôt *really* been sober all this time, because I‚Äôm still relying on a substance and seeking it out with the gusto and enthusiasm of a true addict. My first thought when I realized we were headed toward a national shutdown: I better do whatever it takes to stock up on kratom
in case the supply chain becomes compromised. Another, quieter, part of my consciousness hoped that these little puke-green capsules would become completely inaccessible during the pandemic, forcing me to go cold turkey and kick the habit once and for all. Alas, I‚Äôve found a way to keep scoring, even as my recent lay-off means I totally can‚Äôt even afford it.

What began as a totally ‚Äúnatural‚Äù way to enhance my personal and work life has become drudgery and misery. I‚Äôm on an endless chase to end interdose withdrawals, which have only recently started to include pretty uncomfortable restless legs and thigh aches that wake me up after about four hours of sleep if I don‚Äôt dose right before bedtime (a new development which has scared the ever-loving shit out of me). But the relief I get is more and more temporary, and I‚Äôm hitting the ‚Äúbad part‚Äù of the high earlier and earlier in the day.

Maybe you‚Äôre familiar with the Bad Part of the high? For me, a dedicated OPMS Maeng Da user, it starts to hit in the evening or late afternoon, depending on what time I woke up and started dosing. My back and neck ache from tensing my muscles all day. I‚Äôm on edge; nothing really satisfies. I can‚Äôt get into a ‚Äúflow‚Äù of reading or even watching TV without smoking weed to alleviate my restlessness. I‚Äôm over-stimulated without the motivation or focus to turn it into productivity. Instead, I fritter away my time doing stupid, compulsive activities or getting caught in the scroll-hole of social media. Dosing again only very briefly alleviates my anhedonia. I‚Äôm anxious, I feel like I can‚Äôt get a deep breath. I‚Äôm really irritated with minor things that I can‚Äôt seem to let go of, and I feel like minor problems in my life are suddenly insurmountable. 

Usually, getting a full night‚Äôs rest alleviates this mood, and I‚Äôm feeling better in the morning after a super-high morning dose. So then I think, well, that wasn‚Äôt that bad. Let‚Äôs do it over again. I can sacrifice a few hours of my time at the end of the day to feel better *right now.* Suddenly all my desire to end this abusive relationship with a substance goes out the window. Increasingly, and especially during this quarantine, it‚Äôs like Groundhog Day every day. 

The truth is, I really *can‚Äôt* afford to sacrifice those precious hours at the end of the day to misery and anxiety exacerbated my excessive kratom use. I have goals, damnit, and my relationship with kratom has stymied all of them. I‚Äôm a mom, so my time is not my own for a large majority of the day, but I‚Äôm so disappointed with myself for not working toward my creative and personal goals now that I finally have the chance and the hours at home. Kratom comes first, always. Even while it‚Äôs making me a fucking zombie. 

I want to bust out of this soul-sucking routine once and for all.

High dose vitamin C protocols (which apparently some admin here are censoring for reasons they wouldn't tell me) helped me in a way that I can't describe. I didn't really experience ANY acutes this time around except for after having just woke up until I took my first large dose of sodium ascorbate. The fluey feeling in my body was completely eradicated by the high dose vitamin C, so much so that it felt like cheating, but it was exactly what I needed to actually pull this off. It's been amazing and I'm trying to tell everyone. 

Now I'm experiencing PAWS at day 6. It's mostly anxiety, headaches, and lethargy that doesn't really go away

What helped you the most through this period? I've got a bunch of supplements but I feel like some of them might contribute to making me feel a little off, so I'm being selective and sparing about what I take.

I'm new here. I have been a heavy kratom user for about 1.5 years. I have pretty severe chronic pain and PTSD.. You know, all the fun stuff... Anyways, I started taking kratom as an alternative to opioid medications that doctors were always pushing on me. It worked like a dream for a while, but l I was irresponsible and let my dosage get out of control. Last summer, I was probably pushing 80 gpd or higher, which I feel embarrassed about. 
I recently found out I am pregnant, and quickly got my dosage down from 60 pgd to about 35gpd. I finally gave in and asked my OB for some help. Her response: Suboxene. Suboxene! Now, I know that medication lives, and I fully support anyone who makes that change for the better. However, the idea of quitting kratom is so that my baby is NOT born addicted to any substance. I spoke with other doctors at detox facilities who agreed that Suboxene was indeed not the ideal situation for my baby and I, and to taper off of kratom was the safest way to go. She said to taper more slowly now, getting under control, and when I hit my second trimester, really get my hands dirty and kick it, but all the while trying to avoid severe WDs.
So, here I am. At home with my other daughter during this pandemic, waiting for my body to stabilize at this level, so then I can continue to taper off a gram per day. I am an athlete, so I usually go jogging for stress relief, but since I am here homeschooling my daughter and my husband is working overtime, I cant catch a break. I am trying to be the best mom I can be, but for me, these WDs are the WORST I have ever experienced, which is saying something, because I have walked through the WD fire from other substances. I thought this would be easy, because I rocked all of my other detoxes like a champ! 
My question for you all is: how long do you suppose it will take for my body to adjust to this level? 3 days ago I dropped to 40 gpd one day, 35 gpd the next, and then am hovering around 33 gpd for the last 2 days. I am taking magnesium and l-theanine. I cant take Black seed oil, unfortunately. I use lemon juice with my doses. I am spreading out more small doses per day, to avoid peaks and valleys, but after 2 hours the nasty symptoms really start to kick my ass. I dont give in and cheat though, and I stick to my guns. I wait until my allotted dosing time, and dont go over on my grams to feel better. 
All I want is to stabilize here do I can seriously get this shit OVER WITH. 
Thanks for listening, y'all.",14,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4600204}"

I‚Äôve been taking Kratom for a little over 5 years taking around a tsp. every few hours or so to deal with my shoulder pain. After awhile I realize that the pain was no longer as painful, but I just kept taking it. I noticed that if I didn‚Äôt take it my back would start hurting my mood was off, and my energy sucked so you guessed it I‚Äôd take more. 

I realize that it was a problem so I figured I‚Äôd drink which lead me getting through the 1st 2 days without any withdrawal symptoms so I thought. Once I got to day 3 no drinking boy did those symptoms drop on me like a pile of hot bricks with a hangover worst idea ever. 

I don‚Äôt wanna scare anyone, but trust me I feel amazing now. The best thing I could‚Äôve done for myself was to stop taking it, but when I tell you the journey was a tough one for a few days oh yea it was, but it‚Äôs all worth it. Stick to your guns mind over matter right? Your days will be long AF an I mean long, but I read through a few Dr. Sebi herbal books a had stashed away(had them for years an this made me read them) an this is how I got to where I am now. Feeling amazing still... I do go through a little head fog for a short period early during the day for 30-60 mins, but that‚Äôs it. Back to normal sleep pattern around day 3 or 4 but you guys gotta stick it out. 

This is what I‚Äôve done to help with everything... here we go 1st off to help with sleep I took melatonin it helped a little got me at least 2-4 hours of sleep before the melatonin I got none. 

In the morning I took Iron(took this for the drinking part), Vitamins B12 an B6. I took burdock root 3 times a day, but I made it into a tea it helped with the Kratom cravings because it has that bitter taste an it calmed them down greatly sipping hot burdock root tea really helped. 

Then Sage tea...for me it had a calming effect that has great health benefits at least a cup a day I drank 2 a day. Oh an Netflix kept my mind off of taking any Kratom. I got Irish Sea Moss looked on YouTube how to prep it. I use it in smoothies and it‚Äôs brought my energy back to life. That‚Äôs what I got so far I‚Äôll keep you guys posted.


Forgot to mention the whole time I had a 250g bag staring me down from across the room my wife told me to throw it out, for me I had to stare my addiction dead in its face. Today it goes in the trash I had to stare back to let Kratom know who‚Äôs boss at least 7 days some mite say it‚Äôs stupid but that‚Äôs how I cope with defeating the problem. I‚Äôm kickin Kratoms ass right now. You can too I wouldn‚Äôt recommend the stare down tho. I was gonna post me pouring it out but I wouldn‚Äôt dare to trigger anyone.

well then today I had some nasty physical symptoms set in.... which is very weird considering i had absolutely ZERO for the first 4 days (chills, bad body aches, and unrelenting diarrhea) with a headache that gradually came on towards the end of the day. Then guess what happened... yep, you guessed it, I had some caffeine in the form of sweet tea at dinner and my headache instantly dissipated.

Thinking a green juice cleanse (helps remineralize body and detox metals) plus running and just sweating in hot bath and forcing myself to do yoga, pranayama and meditation need to occur in concert.

I posted a little while back that I was nearing the end of a long taper and I finally went ahead and jumped exactly 48 hours ago. Was a 4 year user, tapered from 30gpd down to 2.8 over 60+ days and took my last dose Saturday afternoon. 

So far the worst part is insomnia. Ive been lucky to get 4 hours of sleep even with prescription sleep meds, melatonin, magnesium, l-theanine, ect. All and all though the withdraws themself haven‚Äôt touched what I felt when I tried to rapid taper from 30g to 15g in the beginning of all of this. Definitely some weird temperature regulation stuff going on, but it is bearable and I think mega-dosing vitamin C has helped quite a bit.

Anyways just wanted to update, trying to stay positive even though I am dreading this insomnia going on for too much longer. I am definitely one of those people who doesnt cope well with little sleep. 

Honestly I feel like tapering for such a long time has helped prepare me for this. What is a few more days/weeks of feeling kinda crappy? I would definitely recommend doing a long taper for those of you who have tried to CT in the past unsuccessfully like me. The acutes so far are nothing compared to what I experienced in the past trying to jump from a higher dose.

     I‚Äôd been a daily user for about 3.5 years. Started with capsules (6 grams a day) and eventually just tossing and washing powder. Was up to about 15 measured teaspoons a day. Each teaspoon is 2.2g, so about 33g daily. I just retired from a rather hectic job after several decades. In my 50‚Äôs and planned on my quit around the retirement. And then the pandemic hit, even better in my mind. Lemme suffer for a bit while I‚Äôm all locked up. Knew it was going to be difficult as I quit once last June for 6 days, CT, but the withdrawals were brutal and I just knew I couldn‚Äôt do it. Didn‚Äôt need as much after 6 days when I restarted but, alas, I was back up to 33gpd in no time. I‚Äôm currently on Day 8, which I know isn‚Äôt reason to celebrate BUT I‚Äôd like to share how I‚Äôve done it this time. On March 1 I cut my dosing in half immediately and went to 8 teaspoons a day, or about 17 gpd. Every week after that, or even a little less than a week twice, I cut 1 teaspoon off my daily dosing (2.2g) By the week prior to Easter Sunday I was down to 3 tsp daily or 6.6 gpd. I stayed with that until Easter Sunday and Monday (4/13) I CT quit. So it was about a six week taper.
     The taper itself, for me, was a tad uncomfortable, but I have a small supply of Xanax .50 (about 60) and also about 30 Ambien. Finally, a little bit of bud. Each night I‚Äôd wait until about 7 and smoke a little bud. During the day I would take a half Xanax if needed. No Ambien until last week when I quit and those I‚Äôve been using almost nightly. No real RLS, but I‚Äôve been taking Magnesium (1000mg), Vitamin C (2000mg) and a multi vitamin daily. The lethargy is the worst part for me. Days 1 and 2 were not that difficult believe it or not. Days 3,4,5.......bad, bad anxiety and depression. But I knew it would pass. Today, Day 8, I feel the best I‚Äôve felt in some time. I will say that the past couple of days, while still dealing with anxiety and a bit of insomnia, I had several ‚Äújolts‚Äù of feeling good. Feeling normal. It kinda comes and goes. But I 100% notice every day, no matter how small, I‚Äôm coming out of this funk and finding myself again. Exercise is limited because my gym is closed because of the pandemic but I make a point to walk everyday. 
      I think the best part of the kratom sobriety is that I realize how much of a fog I was in. I never really felt it but DAMN. I know I‚Äôm not ‚Äúsober‚Äù, but I really don‚Äôt like the Xanax and it does help BIG TIME. As for the bud........it is what it is. Not like I‚Äôm laying around lighting bowls of herb every hour. Lol. I‚Äôm not recommending any of this, as we all have diff chemistries, but I think I‚Äôm doing so much better than expected. I know my brain with try to rationalize reusing again in the future and I‚Äôm prepared for that. I know it‚Äôs never going to be easy peasy. But I 100% know that quitting was the best thing I‚Äôve done in a long time and IT CAN BE DONE. I know the Xanax and Ambien are helpful. I‚Äôm not sure how harder it would be without them. I see a lot of posts from people on here who are battling hard and feel helpless weeks and weeks later. As of today I‚Äôm still feeling a bit uneasy. A little anxious. But it‚Äôs manageable. 

      Don‚Äôt know this is helpful to anyone, but I hope it is. I‚Äôve read many threads on here over the years and am very grateful that many of them prepared me for this. YOU CAN DO IT. I PROMISE.

i was never really a heavy user, i only did around 9g max daily, but i experienced terrible hair loss. i always had pretty good hair, very thick and solid, and it grew crazy fast. kratom started to take its toll on it about 3 months after i started taking it. hair growth slowed down significantly, i lost tons of hair and the remaining ones were prone to break easily and just looked very dry and unhealthy. the stress i experienced because of that obviously must've made it worse, but i'm fully convinced it was the kratom that caused it in the first place.

so i quit on 12/30/19 after a short taper and it didn't immediately get better, but gradually. it took a good 3 months for it to be completely normal again, no bald spots anymore and it's growing pretty fast again. 

there are no studies that deal with this issues so the only source of information you have are individuals like me and others who have had the same experience. and when my hair fell out like crazy these sort of posts were very encouraging, so i'm hoping to do the same here.

Kratom really does numb you and I didn't even realize it.,"I'm not the hippie dippie kind of person to make a big deal out of nothing. I've been on and off many substances over the years, including kratom and pharmaceuticals. Highs and lows and withdrawals and side effects are nothing new to me. But the difference between being on kratom versus off kratom has been significant.

I just went for a joy ride around my city at sunset today. Windows rolled down, warm spring air, my favorite music playing loud, beautiful sky, beautiful architecture all over, beautiful coastline, stone cold sober, euphoric.

Sure I could recognize these things while on kratom. But I couldn't FEEL them at all. I felt kratom, or I felt a lack of kratom, and that's all I felt, and I never realized it until I got out of it. It's like I was in a state of derealization. I wasn't really, and it wasn't as bad as say taking a dissociative drug, but I guess it was in that direction. It's like I was sitting in a plain, cushiony box deep in my mind, looking out, instead of being alive as a whole person. I was used to it and didn't think about it, or even notice it really. It's hard to describe, but if you know, you know.

Things look real. Fresh air smells wonderful. The sky was amazing. Driving my car is fun. Music brings me euphoria and goosebumps. I never realized that I stopped experiencing these things. I'm not anti-kratom at all. It truly improved my life in some ways, but being off kratom was great today.

Of course the beginning of this week was pretty terrible, but now my days are decent, and my nights are just uncomfortable. When it's bed time I just feel so uncomfortable laying in my bed, and I feel hot and cold at the same time. I'm a side sleeper and I keep waking up to turn to the other side like 20x a night.

I've been starting a few healthy habits that I believe have helped me through this. I've been trying to eat more foods high in vitamins and minerals. I threw my cookies and candy away. I started taking a vitamin D3+K2 supplement every morning which I highly recommended (K2 needed when supplementing vitamin D, google it). I also take magnesium glycinate every night before bed which I also highly recommend. It's a high bioavailablity form of magnesium, which is a calming, and it's chemically attached to glycinate, which is a calming amino acid. It's a double whammy for relaxation. I've been taking it every night for months and it still helps me sleep.

I‚Äôm at 16 gpd, but it‚Äôs this sense of anxiety over feeling trapped in this addiction and hating my actions to allow myself to get to this point (been on kratom for around a year and a half now), and if I try aggressively tapering down, then the anxiety turns into this extreme restlessness and sense of dread.

I initially tried smoking it. It looked vaguely like weed and I love weed. At that point I was a serious junkie, so smoking or eating it didn‚Äôt work.

2020-04-18 12:12:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/g3q15x/my_story_with_kratom/,My story with Kratom,"I started taking Kratom religiously September 2018. I have been taking kratom everyday and my intake has increased over time. I'm assuming gpd stands for grams per day ? I never used a scale but measured my intake using a tsp. I started by taking 1 tsp every 6 hours, that quickly increased to every 4. Then I increased by consumption with, a 1 tsp and a half every 4 hours. You get the idea, currently I take 1 over filled tbsp every few hours and night cap with 3 tpsb of premium red to sleep.

I am an alcoholic in recovery and have a history of substance abuse. I started using kratom to contain the alcohol cravings and it honestly worked wonders. It not only motivated me, decreased my anxiety, and helped with my depression. I considered it a god send. Then became problematic, it backed me up so bad I had to give myself a suppository, I lost an incredible amount of hair, and look drained all the time. It quickly has taken over my life. I fixate my schedule around when I can take another dose of kratom. If I do not take it within 4 hours, I have chronic yawning, agitation, distorted thinking, headache, and chills. That's only after 4 hours!! I started school and my ability to focus, while on Kratom, was slim to none. I also could not stay awake in class. Sometimes I take too much throughout the day and am dizzy, lightheaded, and feel i can fall asleep on foot. On top of that, with an increased intake, I have socially isolated to the point where I have no friends. I can't go to AA because this isn't considered ""sober"", I can't hang out with coworkers because everyone drinks, and I also don't want people to know how much this controls my life.

Given everything going on with COVID-19, thought to myself, ""what a perfect time to stop cold turkey"". My anxiety has been high lately because I'm a smoker and convince myself every second I am going to die. I live in upstate NY and the spread is brutal up here. When I read common symptoms with Kratom, they're flu like symptoms. I am too nervous to try and feel i may convince myself it's the virus.

So I'm writing to get feedback, support, and motivation. Right now I feel like I can't live without kratom but want to so bad. I make excuses like, well atleast it's not alcohol because I wouldn't be moving from the couch or working. I still work, clean, take care of the dogs, do school work, and carry on a relatively okay relationship with my boyfriend. It's pathetic that I make those justifications because I know this is not normal behavior, having to take something every few hours...to feel ""normal"".

I want my hair back. I want to go back to being social. I want to feel like I have genuine emotions. I want a good night's rest. I'm scared and I don't want to feel scared anymore. I don't want to base my life around a substance like I have that past 15 years.",8,"{'covid': 1, 'virus': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5524943}"

It got to the point where it did nothing for me, and started to make me feel depressed because I knew I had a huge problem. I have tired to quit so many times. I usually make it one month and then relapse because I get sick of the insomnia and depression during PAWS. One thing I keep hearing about Kratom is the PAWS is worse for some than prescription opiates and even heroin. Regardless, it takes a very long time to start feeling normal. I had made it about 5 weeks this time before I relapsed. I took Kratom for two and a half weeks with a few day breaks in between because I was afraid of the physical WD. Finally my girlfriend found out and was very upset. She had helped me quit. I didn‚Äôt want to relapse, but with everything going on in the world right now I found a million excuses and just wanted to feel better and normal. It‚Äôs a very very hard time to get and stay sober right now. I haven‚Äôt taken Kratom for about 6 days now, and here is what I‚Äôm doing different this time. My GF told me if she catches me using Kratom again we are breaking up, and even with that I know I would sneak it here and there. So I found a good way to hold myself accountable. I bought Kratom drug tests and I‚Äôm giving them to her and telling her to give them to me randomly every week. I found them online 25 for 65 bucks. A lot cheaper than my Kratom habit so worth every penny. Now I CANT use because i don‚Äôt want to lose here and get kicked out of the house. I‚Äôve also been attending NA meetings at a park here every day Monday-Friday. If you can‚Äôt do that they do them online everyday. I got a sponsor and I‚Äôm working through the 12 steps with him. I have found for me I need an army of people to help me quit. Now a lot of you probably don‚Äôt need to do all this, but if you are like me and have tried to quit multiple times without success I think NA meetings, getting a sponsor, and then having someone you trust, but will get on your ass, give you Kratom drug tests in a pretty damn good place to start.

Luckily, so far I have been able to sleep.  Yesterday was not terrible, other than some lethargy, but I had a hard time falling asleep last night until I finally did and got a solid 8 to 10 hours.  I don‚Äôt expect it to last but it was a pleasant surprise compared to other people‚Äôs reports.  Today I have been extremely lethargic, mentally foggy, and depressed but I did a few things like fold laundry and walk on the treadmill for a little bit while watching Netflix and it seemed to greatly help getting my mind off things.  I keep thinking about kratom and how easy it would be to get get some but I also know that I don‚Äôt want to live that lie anymore.  For me, towards the end of my kratom usage it was very similar to just going through a WD.  I kept chasing the high from the first few times I did it but in the end spent a lot of time coming down, feeling nauseous, sweating all night, and throwing up and I realized there was no joy in taking this substance anymore.  It always feels good for a little bit but then reality sets in and I just realized I was poisoning my body and my mind.  

I don‚Äôt know how long this WD phase will last, but forcing myself to stay occupied seems to help greatly and mild amounts of caffeine and nicotine take the edge off from time to time.  I also decided to quit smoking CT the same day I dropped kratom, and I don‚Äôt know how great of an idea that was, but I still have a vape and some nicotine pouches to prevent myself from experiencing that WD full force.  Overall it has been a trying experience and I am not sure how much worse it will get.  I was probably doing anywhere from 20-30 gpd but I was also taking a lot of extract so I don‚Äôt know how much is in that.  All I know is regardless of how shitty I feel now, deep down inside I feel pretty good knowing that I am on the road back to being my true self instead of the fake, hollow, shell of a human I was on kratom.",14,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43101585}"

Quick background. Former opiate user. Went to subxone. Got down to the smallest sliver of sub you could take, it was broken off a 2mg strip so probably .10 or a mg. Anyway decided to take K to help me get off sub. Didnt know the effects blah blah. So i was taking 12gpd in December ish. February started my taper. Went from 12-8-6... Finally got down to 3 grams per day and have been there for a month. Feeling blah no energy the whole month... I decided to then just take less. I tried CT from 3gpd and i couldnt do it.... So I am now at 1 gram a day and these past two days I dont ever in my life remember having so much natural energy. Tomorrow I will stop completly but i have been on ONE gram for 4 days now so i dont know if ill experience too many wd. I will say the past two weeks when i went from 3 grams to 1 i did withdraw a bit, so I am hoping that is the hardest part of the withdrawals. Tough sleep. sweats. anxiety here and there but holy crap the feeling of actual energy is pushing me right now. My biggest problem was the 2 hour mark So weird. Id take a half gram every two hours. But come close to the 2 hour mark i started feeing uneasy, angry and achy.   Until i realized if i push it to three and four I felt a bit better, without taking anymore. Then when i took a half gram or 1/4 gram 3-4 hours instead of 2 i felt real good.  Anyway here I am one gram a day (2   1/2 gram capsules) and feeling like i havent in years. Sorry this post may be a bit convoluted, im happy but just woke up.... Dont know why i wanted to post but here i am. I guess the biggest thing is, tapers can work but you have to do some work. I dont remember the last time vacuuming and cleaning the yard was so pleasurable. I do have memories of happiness in doing those things but it was so long ago, and i have it back....

My name is Christian, I'm 38 and I'm down to about 20gpd from 30-40 after having taken kratom for 6 years. My handle 'cinsolidarity' signifies I think that human unity is likely the key to solving most of our social problems. I only mention that to maybe help people remember me over the next few weeks. I'll be posting here daily starting tomorrow while I quit. My mom, who I've been mending a relationship with after a decade of my alcoholism (I finally quit drinking a year ago), is letting me stay with her while I get through the rough first few 3 or 4 days, which I'm thankful for and will help a lot.

Supplements I have: Magnesium, Black seed oil, Fish oil, Ashwaganda, Agmatine, Sodium Ascorbate (Vitamin C), L-Theanine, L-Tyrosine, DL-Phenylalanine, 5-HTP, SAM-e, NAC, GABA, Immodium, Valerian root, etc. I'm a little worried about interactions between some of the more complex neurotransmitter supplements. Please let me know if you have any relevant info or concerns about these supplements, any possible negative interactions between them (i'll be looking into it more), if you noticed one in particularly REALLY helping you in a noticable way.

Can anyone give me any other special tips on what supplements you took, foods you ate, activities, anything that helped you the most during the toughest parts of the withdraw? Anything you would've liked to know or been able to tell yourself if you could go back and tell yourself before the dive? Any helpful tidbits of advice you can give would be greatly appreciated.

Lastly, I've been taking Zquil every night for almost a year. But apparently the info page on here says 'diphenhydramine' can make RLS worse. I expect to obviously have sleep issues through this already as it is, but also stopping the Zquil now will make it even harder. Please tell me your advice on what helps get to sleep if you have any.

The first week sucked, chills, anxiety, rls, diarrhea, depression, 4 hours sleep total. If you can get a benzodiazepines  short term use it. Once again.... short term. On the 2nd week, symptoms  decreased a little every day by %5-10. Biggest problem is sleep but it shall pass.

Reason for quitting
1. 27 y/o Male in great shape working at a bar, and even though I can get women with no worries, there is no sex drive whatsoever!!! 

2. Carrying a bag with me everywhere.  The next dose is the only thing that matter. 

3. The $$$ lost is definitely not worth the mild boost. 

4. Every single passion in my life stopped due to kratom. This is the biggest reason. As a former hospice nurse, time is too short to spend being chained to a substance.

At this moment I got in rehab for using kratom roughly 40g a day. The reason I abused kratom is because of my restless legs. (RLS) . I literally cannot sleep days without the kratom.

My neurologist prescribed me gababentin 2400mg a day. I've been taking this for 2-3 weeks. And it's helping a bit. (My RLS will get better after the kratom withdrawals since the kratom withdrawals makes my RLS even worser than it already is) There's a big chance the gababentin will be increased to 3600mg a day since the dose 2400mg a day is helping just a bit for my RLS

Now it has been one month ago since I've been taking kratom and I still feel sick every day: Headaches, stomach ache, diarrhea, joint pain, like a typical opioid withdrawal. Normally if I quit kratom the withdrawal symptoms will fade away after a week or 2.

&#x200B;

I've been reading about gababentin and it's side effects which made me pretty anxious. That's why I do have got some questions about it if you guys don't mind:

* *Can the gababentin cause the flu symptoms I've lised above, or is it still the kratom withdrawal?*
* *I'm planning to use gababentin my whole life for my RLS since I have RLS my whole life. How smart is this?*
* *Will I get withdrawals after quitting gababentin, and how addictive is it?*
* *IF the flu symptoms I still have is caused by gababentin, is this just a side effect which eventually will fade away? If yes, how long till it fades away?*

I would love to see some serious reactions since i'm gonna talk to my neurologist tomorrow morning to change my RLS medication. He says it's not addictive at all. But he said the same thing about lyrica, that's why i'm gonna ask for an second neurologist opinion

I went 58 days then I used a little bit for about 2 weeks because I had a bad cold. I used it to suppress the cough and make it so I could feel a little better. Now I am at 57 days again and will never touch it again. When I was tapering down the last mouth I got bad Erectile dysfunction and when I quit completely I was dead down there. Even super high dose Viagra 200mg didn‚Äôt do shit. I was so confused about what was happening. Everybody talks about the bounce back. Right before my cold I seemed like I was getting better again then i had the same problems all over again. Not dead like the first few weeks from quitting the first time. I am 99% positive my dopamine system was all jacked up. All my symptoms were the same as people who go on NOFAP. I had brain fog. I was more tired. I had bad ED. I had trouble even Fapping by myself without ED drugs. I started taking Wellbutrin in March which keeps the dopamine around longer and almost all my symptoms went away except for the ED problems. The last 2 months though I have been fapping a lot because of no sex. I didn‚Äôt use porn that much but just a week ago I did use it for about a week. I was fapping like 4 times a day. I realized I had a problem when I had to take viagra just to get hard by myself and even then during porn it would start going soft. I have never been into super weird stuff or mean abuse or all that other crazy stuff. Then I started NOFAP. What I was reading was crazy similar to everything that I was feeling. If I looked at porn now I hardly feel anything. No surge of desire or lust. I have hardly any libido. I remember about 1 year into my 4 year kratom habit I thought it was great because porn didn‚Äôt seem to do as much for me. I just didn‚Äôt care. Then I got to the point where I could have sex but I needed Viagra. The last 6 months before I started dying down there I was having lots of sex with my girlfriend at least once a day or 2-3 times. I started tapering down because once in a while I couldn‚Äôt finish Which really made my girlfriend think all these negative thoughts about herself. I think once I got to a low enough point that I wasn‚Äôt getting enough dopamine from kratom I just couldn‚Äôt get it up anymore. So I scrambled to quite over November. My withdrawals weren‚Äôt that bad. The only lasting effect was ED. Sorry for the long background and buildup but if someone else is going through this I want to be helpful for Them. I am 99% positive I have dopamine burnout like a hardcore porn addict even though I used it sporadically. So like I said 57 days kratom free now. I quit alcohol too(I had about one drink a night)(I also quite everything that causes euphoria or a dopamine spike like pheni-but or Kava.)I quit all PMO and I am doing the 90 day reboot and beyond. I am exercising every day. Wim Hoff cold showers and breathing and PC muscle exercises everyday. I am taking ashwaganda ksm66 and a few other herbs. I am trying to eat healthier too. I am tapering down on the Wellbutrin over the next month too because I wonder if that will delay my recovering because it keeps dopamine levels higher not through secretion but just by reuptake inhibition. I am 99.9% sure this is my problem. I seriously thought I destroyed my libido and Man powers down there. But after looking into NOFAP I was amazed that my symptoms were almost identical. I had my testosterone checked twice on January. One at 475 and the next at 535ng/dL and  My available T is 91pg/ml. It took me forever trying to find out what was wrong with me thinking it was testosterone first this this then that. I am 40 and about 11% body fat so I am pretty fit. I just hope my dopamine system doesn‚Äôt take 6 months to a year to get back to normal. So long story short if anybody else is having low libido and ED after quitting this is most likely the problem. (Day 5 of NOFAP reboot)

Also of note I have kept track of nocturnal Erections since my originally quit date back on December 1st. I didn‚Äôt have any for about 2-3 weeks then at least 100 of the last 125 days I have had them. Most of the time full strength Erections. That had me scratching my head. How I can I have full Erections in the night but struggle during the day. It is because the mechanism of how it happens is different. Spontaneous ones at night has nothing to do with desire or stimulation. That put my mind at ease a little because I at least knew things functioned down there.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4541909}"

So awesome to have a community supporting one another down this path. Thanks to all of you.

Quick background: Tried tapering but when the restrictions on non-essential businesses kept getting extended, I found myself out of Kratom. So now I'm going CT on 3 year Kratom use 30-50 gpd. I'm on my 3rd day, and trying to figure out the best methods to mitigate the symptoms. I have a pretty heavy dose of klonopin (3mgs/day) and vyvanse (60mg/day). Do you think using these will interefere/prolong my recovery? 

I've been on vyvanse for 4 years, adderall for 4 years prior to vyvanse (adderall is too heavy on the psyche), and benzos for 9 years (7 years ativan, 2 year klonopin). I've never had a problem with being dependent on vyvanse, benzos, muscle relaxers, or alcohol. Just optiates and kratom. 

I've been taking 3mgs of klonopin, and 60 mg of vyvanse. I know each of these (moreso vyvanse) act on similar ""good feeling"" neurotransmitters as optiates do, so thought it might help with the WD. Last thing I want to do is be taking these during CT and not getting anywhere with recovery, though. 

I'm curious to hear what y'alls experiences/perspectives are on using klonopin, vyvanse, muscle relaxers, ibuprofen, water, etc. to help mitigate the WD symptoms. I'm on day 3 - main symptoms are feeling like an icicle, very sore (especially legs), lots of anxiety, no motivation. 

All that said - do any of you have thoughts about the above use for WD symptom reduction, or any other things that helped get you through the worst symptoms? I know Vit C is mentioned a lot, but unfortunately that reduces the efficacy of my vyvanse which I need to work. Wondering what your thoughts are on the value (relative to one another) of drinking a lot of water, ibuprofen, zzzquil for sleeping, and lifting weights in this process?

Telomeres are structures of repeated sequences placed at the ends of chromosomes, which play a major role in various cellular processes. Over the past few years, telomere length has been associated with different environmental and physical factors, as well as with a number of diseases, such as cancer. A number of studies have associated telomere length with many substances that the participants have used, such as anxiolytics and hypnotics. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between telomere length and drug abuse. Following the methodology of quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization (Q‚ÄëFISH), we demonstrated that there was a reduction in telomere length in drug abusers. Furthermore, we evaluated this decrease in relation to cell aging and demonstrated that the biological age of drug abusers, particularly the one of opiate users, was by far greater than their chronological age, depending on the difference between the telomere length of abusers and healthy individuals. The findings of this study indicate an association between telomere length and drug abuse, which leads to premature biological aging. The latter warrants further investigation in order to establish this association in different types of drugs with regard to the severity and the chronic abuse of drugs.

Ive been a consistent kratom user for about 7 years,  taking about 20-24 gpd for the past 3-4 years. Last year has probably been about 24gpd. 
Im on day 4 of my taper. Sleep isnt great but im getting at least 5 hours a night. First few nights led to heavy sweating (im also taking a weed break, on day 10 of that). Ive gone from 24gpd down to 10 in 4 days, and today looks like I'll settle around 8 grams. It's actually been extremely easy thus far. I'll probably stay at 8 until Saturday.
I let my wife know about my taper, she didn't love my usage, but knowing my history was generally okay with it. Maybe thats because i never exhibited most of the issues I've seen here (rage, fits, mental instability). It legitimately felt like very strong coffe mixed with some mild body high opiate type effects, but essentially everyone in my life found me more pleasant than before the last 7 years. 
Just writing this for others like myself that end up here. My motivation for stopping is soley a desire to stop clock watching and less energy spikes (though i will miss the EXTREME productivity), as well as admitting that it's time to stop swlf medicating and seek professional guidance for any issues i have. 
I'm sure it can get worse and likely will as i get down to zero, but my experience this far has been very mild. I am in excellent shape (48 bpm restinf heart rate even after dosing) and exercise 90 min a day 4-5x a week (hasn't stopped with taper).

I'm not going to write out my entire life's story of how I have an addictive personality and have been chasing that euphoric high ever since I was 12 years old. But I will say that I discovered kratom 3.5 yrs ago after I had bought a bottle of pain relief at a gas station. And the rest is history. From there it's been a never ending roller coaster of self inflicted torture. I've tried to quit several times now and each time it gets way harder to try and quit. My willpower to this plant is next to nothing and feel totally helpless and trapped. I have the same routine everyday. Wake up take kratom, play xbox until I get the urge to eat. Eat and then sit up in bed playing on my phone. I wait for 2 hours roughly and dose again. Then I either go to work(self employed painter), or do things here at the house. I dose 5 times a day with 2 hours off after meals which I eat 2 or 3 times a day. The last time I tried to quit I made it to day 50 something and then caved in because of the anhedonia. I also take effexor 37.5 mg a day. I even tried doubling my effexor dose to try in combat the depression, anhedonia but to no avail. I really don't know what to do at this point. I'm so sick of this crap!!!
I know that life will be so much more rewarding and fulfilling if I was not using anything but my willpower has failed me many times. It's also become an ingrained ritual of sorts and my brain has been rewired to do this routine.
I am a single 38 year old male living at my mom's house. I am just about to get my driving privileges fully back meaning to get the ignition interlock device off my truck for good. Kratom has kept me from having the urge to drink but has also created this cycle of dependence.
I know that if I stay on kratom I will have no future whatsoever and will probably die alone since no one is going to want to be with me since I have no sex drive. 
And since I'm on this cycle of addiction I don't think I'll advance where money is concerned since I have to lay down at work after I eat. I also vape a lot more when using kratom. 
I am no where near using my full brain power due to the brain fog that kratom gives me.
There is so much that I want to do in life and have so much potential but am stuck in this kratom cycle of addiction.
So if you are reading this and are trying to quit as well I feel your pain. If you are reading this and are dabbling with it I strongly urge you to reconsider your life's path. This is no life to live and wish I would have listened to my parents when I was 12 years old.

I was experiencing some depression when I heard about kratom, so it became my next big thing. 

I‚Äôm very familiar with methadone and heroin WD‚Äôs.  In severity of the acute WDs, would any of you say that kratom is in any way comparable? I‚Äôm not worried about the pain of quitting, I just want to know what to expect. I see some people at the same dose and they just had anxiety and felt down, or at least their tone didn‚Äôt seem so bad. Is it as devastatingly soul crushing, or Is it more so mental? 

Also, I learned about how soldiers in the Vietnam war had a significantly higher success rate on staying sober because when they came back to the USA, it was a complete change for them and they had to learn a new routine and new habits. 
My point is, is that since I am going to put myself through hell and will have to ultimately learn how to be sober again, (changing my perception and habits), would it be a good time to quite nicotine?

Ive been taking kratom for 3 years 30+gpd, i used it to help with my back pain,  anxiety attacks, and depression and it still did work well all the way till the end. I knew i had a major dependancy to it though as it was draining lots of my money, id take it the second id wake up, stopped at my head shop through the work day to get more if i ran out, and recently even stockpiled about 1KG at the beginning of my quarantine out of fear of running out.

That was the straw that broke the camels back, a few days after stockpiling on kratom i didn‚Äôt enjoy the label of being an addict and the guilt started to eat me alive. I gave my friend about a pound (all i had left, started using WAY more when i had it bulk) and jumped off the wagon with no taper plan or anything. Withdrawal set in within hours...

The first week was absolute horror, i slept 10 hours over 5 days and had cold sweats, hot flashes, shakes, fatigue, insomnia, depression, suicidal ideation, RLS, diarrhea, lack of appetite, sneezing, and probably a few more things im forgetting but those were all to a pretty high degree. It was one of the most uncomfortable things to go through in my life thus far but now that things are getting better i couldn‚Äôt be any happier i did it! Day 8/9 is when the real clarity and positive mood change happened and ever since then i‚Äôve been keeping myself busy, trying things i never would have tried before just so i dont slip back to the easy slippery slope of kratom.

One thing i have been wondering to anyone whos been here before is, when do the temptations to start doing kratom again subside? Thats the only thing im really battling with now is just the daily fight to stay clean and keep myself on track. Anyways, best of luck and godspeed to all on this journey!

I learned this in rehab , kicking much harder stuff than Kratom .... Acetominophen (Tylenol) reduces flu like symptoms and withdrawals DRAMATICALLY !! 

You will still have some fatigue issues that comes in waves , and for me cold sweats and restless leg . 

But it makes it much easier to sleep through it , I can sleep half the day with Tylenol ... And it reduces the withdrawals by at least 70% I would say . 

In rehab they gave us 2 extra strength (1,000mg total) .. I know it‚Äôs not good for your liver long term , but using it for 1 week isn‚Äôt going to hurt anything . 

I remember taking Vicodin and I would chew like 11,000 mg acetaminophen some days .. sometimes less and sometimes more .. for years . 

What I did for withdrawals was I would take 3x 500mg , every 6 hours . 

Works amazing . 

Also to help your body detox itself eat healthy , stay hydrated , fiber !! (Fiber pulls toxins out the body - drink a tall glass of Metamucil 2x a day) , stool softeners help .... also a good diet for detoxing is stuff that doesn‚Äôt upset your stomach 

No sugar 
No coffee 

Green tea with pomegranate is great . 

I would eat 30g carbs (brown rice or quinoa) , 3.5 oz chicken or white fish , 1 serving green beans or asparagus .. for women 

40g carbs , 4.5 oz meat , same with veggies 

Add a small amount of olive oil to each .. for men add 3/4 tbsp . 

Also excercise .. it is hard , but forcing yourself to do it makes you feel better and get through it faster . 

Day 1 I went on a 2 mile hike .. and it was brutal .. cold sweats like crazy and it was hot , fatigue and winded ... I forced myself to go on another that night .. and I would take my dogs for a 20-30 minute walk every day .. and forcing yourself to do stuff ... 

You don‚Äôt have to be Hercules , I still slept a lot during the day ... but I would spend a few hours doing something each day , and each day I was able to do more . 

Also hot baths get rid of the cold sweaty feeling .. epsom salt helps also in the bath.

I was in a state of panic and terror, and I have been relying on Kratom for a year now to fix those feelings of anxiety. Take that away, and boy oh boy...it is not easy. Especially during this pandemic where stress is high! But honestly, no better time to quit than now while I am stuck inside and am not expected anywhere. I want to post here to give others hope as you all have done for me.

I was at 30 grams per day (I have been using kratom for exactly a year now) and dropped to 8 grams (4 grams in the morning and 4 grams at night) immediately when one final shower session was traumatic enough for me to face what was going on....mind you, I had been losing hair for months but this particular shower had me in a state of panic. My hair was falling out in such vast quantities in such a short amount of time...within a week and a half or so I dropped to 4 grams per day which lasted maybe 3 days, then just finally took the jump this past Saturday after my last dose that morning. Easter Sunday was my first day completely free of Kratom. The reason why I jumped so quickly is because 8 grams was miserable, 4 grams was miserable, and if I'm gonna be miserable, I might as well just be miserable and get this over with as fast as possible. 60 hours now, no kratom here and feeling better than I was those 2 weeks I was taking 8 and then 4 grams per day which is very interesting. I thought I'd feel worse being completely off of it. But I have more hope now that my body will go back to normal sooner than tapering. It hasn't been easy....when I was tapering, those 2 weeks felt like I was grieving the death of someone, but instead, I was grieving my hair loss and the loss of my crutch, which was kratom! Again, I feel much more hopeful now that I have completely quit. I am taking Propedrine, black seed oil, magnesium, biotin, and using Lipogaine to speed up my hair recovery process. I am 31 and female, so hair loss is not an option, especially for someone like me who has used my appearance as a defense mechanism since I can remember.

A tip to those having a tough time.  If you are like me, you may be spending a lot of time in bed.  That's o.k.  Eventually my body and mind tell me when it's time to get up and exercise.  Don't push the exercise though if your feeling like shit.  In my experience it doesn't help.  Your body knows when it's time to do something.  Hang in there, it does get better.",15,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.6401133}"

At first a couple days a week to help me with exhaustion from working long hours at a stressful job. I didn‚Äôt do it weekly at first. Fast forward a couple months I began taking it about 5 days a week. The off days were very manageable and not too much sign of WD. Which lead me to believe I could continue like that. I went a couple weeks using it straight and that was enough for the Kratom to dig its claws in and do it‚Äôs damage and cause the dependence. I was ready to be done again. I am a SAHM now of 5 kids. My last quit was CT off roughly 60+ gpd. It was pure torture but I did it. This time around I was using roughly 30 gpd. I have tapered down to 11.5 gpd in 5 days. Days are pretty good and I do good but nights are tougher. Part of me wants to just get it over with but the other part wants to continue to taper. When it comes to symptoms  no  sleep is by far my hardest one to overcome. Nights are torture laying there just wishing for sleep to come. I can‚Äôt function on no sleep so that is why I‚Äôm trying the taper. So far I‚Äôve done ok and have been disciplined and not went off my dose schedule. I‚Äôm considering taking my dose down to 8g today since I seem to be doing ok. Anyway just telling my story.

I‚Äôm so effing over this.","This is my fifth attempt to quit and I‚Äôm just so sick and tired of playing through this cycle over and over. I spend all of this time and effort tapering down, make it through the first few days without any kratom at all, then I get hit with the most horrific period pain you can possibly imagine. My lower back is aching with pain, my upper thighs feel like they‚Äôre being stabbed with hot daggers, the menstrual cramps are so painful that I keep throwing up from the pain, and then there‚Äôs the lovely pms diarrhea. All on top of kratom withdrawal.

Men, since you don‚Äôt really know what it feels like, imagine how you‚Äôve felt when you get mild food poisoning and you get that awful stabbing/pressure like pain in your gut when you‚Äôre about to have explosive diarrhea and all you can think about is getting to the toilet as fast as you can to relieve the terrible discomfort. Now imagine that you can‚Äôt go no matter how hard you try. That lasts all day and all night and sometimes the following day as well. Add in lower back pain that radiates down your hips and thighs and that‚Äôs about what it feels like.

Anyway, this is why I keep relapsing. I get to a point that I have to escape the pain and all of my progress goes out the window. It feels like the universe just doesn‚Äôt want me to quit because getting down to zero always makes my period start no matter where I am in my cycle, and it‚Äôs always way worse than it ever was before I started kratom.

I‚Äôm not falling for it this time. I‚Äôm going to smoke a bunch of high CBD flower, take an epsom salt bath and try to sleep this off. I‚Äôm done being a slave to this stupid green garbage and I know that a little relief now will just be a trade off for several more weeks of feeling numb. 

I‚Äôm sorry for the TMI post but I feel like I had to put it out there that no matter what you‚Äôre going through, it could be worse, and all of this suffering is only temporary. When you‚Äôre in the thick of it, a minute can feel like an hour, but you just have to keep pushing forward.

Man, Im day 5 CT and I had to leave work early today bc I feel so bad. I can't focus, I can barely move but I can't sit still, Its just such a fucked up feeling. I did feel better on Kratom but its not real, its not me. I had a meltdown on day 2 (I think it was, the last 5 days have been a blur) and went into my closet to see if I could find any that I forgot about (that's where I use to hide it from my family). I found hundreds (literally hundreds) of the little brown baggies the smoke shop sells it in. It caused me to break down in tears. I have chosen Kratom over my family and friends for years. I have no sex life even though I have a beautiful woman that loves me. The addiction has consumed me and the end result is always the same. It got so bad I threw up every day bc of the amount I had to take to feed my addiction. 6 days ago I had my 5 year old son patting me on the back while I vomited at the toilet asking me, ""how did you get this way daddy?"" The truth is, I don't know. I am crying my eyes out as I type this at this very moment. I guess letting it all out does help. When I got home from work I sat in the driveway for 30 minutes debating going to the smoke shop to get just a couple grams but I have been there many times and the result will be the same. Right back to the normal dose by tomorrow. I feel numb and helpless, I want to punch a hole in the wall and have a full blown meltdown at the same time. I hate that FUCKING tree leaf and I want to blame it for all my problems but I can't. Its all my fault and was always my choice. Fuck Kratom. 3 years 56 GPD habit. 5 years total use.

I can not believe where I was when this post was typed. It really does break my heart. I stopped counting after 2 weeks ct because I felt it made things harder and seem more drawn out. It says it was posted a month ago but I don't know how accurate that is. It feels much longer.   
In just the last couple days things began to improve a lot more. It came in waves, the first 9 days were almost unbearable. Aches, Insomnia, fatigue, stomach cramps and anxiety on an unprecedented level. I thought it would never end. Things leveled off somewhere around day 10. I was still fatigued and anxious but nothing like before. I stopped counting the days a few days later but not much changed for another 2 weeks. Just in the last few days, a light switch, if you will, turned on in my mind and spirit. For the first time I put my arm around my significant other and could feel empathy and compassion, something I was worried would never return. I got out of the house and went to the park with the kids and was able to experience happiness and be content with my inner self. No one ever knew how bad my addiction was and it didn't necessarily have a negative impact on my life from others standpoint. However, it destroyed me from the inside out. Chiseling away at who I was and the addiction just continued to grow to the point of spiritual implosion. It just wasn't me and the feelings were not real. I think all addiction follows the same course and you will always trade something precious for the poison. The withdrawal was awful but it was worth it. What I feel now is real and that makes me happy. To look at the stars and the sunset and feel the joy is something I will never trade off again. I am ashamed I let it go as far as it did but I am thankful to be here now. Thank you all that posted your experiences here. You motivated me and let me know what to expect. I do not think I could do it without you. I do not know if I am functioning at 100% but I know things will continue to get better.",10,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.93051404}"

Yesterday was the first complete day (midnight to midnight) that I did not use any Kratom in over 2 years. 

I had been tapering from early February and I had planned to stop in mid-March. But as we all know, the world changed as we know it by early March with Covid-19. So instead of quitting at that time, I just kept lowering my dosage and staying home as much as possible. 

Anyhow, my usage has gotten lower to the point where I assumed I could just stop at anytime if I wanted; at least that‚Äôs what I told myself. So yesterday was 10 weeks since I first began tapering, so I decided to find out. Last dose was 1:30 Saturday afternoon, just 1 gram. Since then I have done nothing! It‚Äôs only been a day and a half, but it‚Äôs a big step.

As far as withdrawals, I haven‚Äôt experienced any. I figured I‚Äôd have achy knees and elbows and lethargy, as I have in the past when stopping. But Sunday felt good. I‚Äôm not out of the woods by any stretch, but I‚Äôm proud of this.

My habit does what everyone does and grows. Very recently I was up to about 60 grams a day and when it would wear off or when I‚Äôd wake up I had horrible panic attacks. I‚Äôve never experienced one before and they aren‚Äôt typical for me. It was a bad side effect to say the least. 

I‚Äôm also a sufferer from high blood pressure and my blood pressure went through the roof like never before. I had stop taking my medication almost 2 years ago because I got it down with diet and exercise for a while until Kratom took all of my motivation. 

Anyway the medication I have is called Lisonopril. It‚Äôs what‚Äôs known as an Ace Inhibitor. We the following day after taking some I had sitting in the cupboard I woke up with no withdrawal from Kratom. It was odd. So I took it again the night before and the same thing again. 

So I‚Äôm not advocating seeking out a blood pressure medication to help get off Kratom but if someone happens to rightfully have it and not taking it and wants to quit I wanted to share that experience with you. 

I can‚Äôt find anything online about the relation of Ace Inhibitors and opiate or kratom withdraws but this is definitely for real.

I told them I was coming off of Kratom and no one there have seemed to have heard of it. They were not willing to start me on suboxone so I left. I was sitting in agonizing anxiety and could not take it anymore. I took kratom as soon as i got home. Immediately after I contacted my psychiatrist. After explaining what happened he prescribed me two 2 mg suboxone strips. He told me too wait 24 hours after my last dose to take it. I could not make it that long, and took it only 20 hours after. That was about an hour ago and I am feeling back to baseline. I know getting off suboxone can be a devil in itself as well so I dont need any leactures, please. I'm only going to be on it for a week. It still beats downing that horrid powder down 3 times a day, and having to stick to an annoying and inconvenient dosing schedule. I'm just glad to be taking a step in the right direction. Kratom was killing my sex drive, and my hair was starting to thin, which was affecting my confidence. I'm not going anywhere with this post, I just felt like sharing. Best of luck to anyone else trying to get off of kratom. I beleive in you, and you can do it. Take care all.",16,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.55636775}"

Gradually transitioned to much more as then I became daily user. I think my highest per night (I never use kratom during the daytime) was about 12 grams but maybe more. Once I lost access to a scale I just started eyeballing it with a normal spoon. So I began to start rationing because of the quarantine. Eventually I just said fuck it last week and took the rest I had which was maybe 6-8 grams or so. Well I'm on like day 4 or something and so far I've felt fine besides some minor aches, gastric distress, minor insomnia (which I have anyway), minor irritation. Nothing major.

Whereas normal people eat three meals per day, I have three ""dosing sessions"" per day, each of which consists of two teaspoons of kratom, 400 mg of gabapentin, a cup of tea, and of course some food. I don't get ""hungry"" for a meal--rather, I begin feeling kratom and/or gabapentin withdrawals, which tells me it's time for a meal/dosing session. No ""session"" feels complete without all four, and none of the four are particularly appealing on their own (including food).

I'm thinking when I finally get the willpower together to quit kratom and gabapentin, the first step will be to decouple. That is, go a week or so without reducing my net intake of kratom or gabapentin (or tea, for that matter) but just stop doing them together, and once that relationship has finally been broken, begin tapering kratom and gabapentin (either one at a time or together, not sure what would be the best approach).

But I woke up drank some coffee , took a shower and the whole tome I‚Äôm thinking WOW this is it ? This isn‚Äôt so bad . And then the day went on and omg I had no idea how bad it was about to get . As I lay around trying to watch tv I just kept feeling worse . Sweaty . Weak . Beyond weak . By 8 pm that night I caved in and made one dose of the red strain which I used to use for night time. It did allow me to sleep all night . 
Day 2 woke up feeling horrible . Clammy . Uncomfortable in my own skin . My toddler running around jumping on me . Not letting me rest . I had to make a store trip so I gave in and made a half of my usual dose . This was around 10 am. This made my symptoms tolerable. I didn‚Äôt feel great but that sweaty clammy feeling went away for a couple hours . Around 8pm I made another half dose of the red strain 
Day 3 woke up covered in sweat 6am . Couldn‚Äôt go back to sleep . Immediately gave in made a half dose at 9am . My plan is to hold off until 8pm again and make another half dose . 
Idk if what I‚Äôm doing is prolonging my problem . But I feel like super proud of my self control through out the day.  Any advice? I‚Äôm attempting what they call a rapid taper . But This is my version and idk if It‚Äôs going to help in the long run . I feel like I just don‚Äôt have time to cold turkey . My toddler . My business. I have a million things to do all the time . I still feel crappy all day , but it‚Äôs not as intense with the 1 dose a day .

I want to quit, i really do, but I am scared. Scared that the physical withdrawl will drive me crazy, but mainly I am scared that I will behave like an asshole when I stop taking it and losing my girlfriend because of that. (she has no idea)

I don't even know how much I take. I stopped weighing because I don't want these bad numbers in my head bringing me down. If I had to guess it would be around 45gpd. This amount for 4 month, does someone know what kind of withdrawl I will have to expect.

I need some help, some support. I am too scared to tell anyone, even though that would be the right thing, but I want to start here. My plan atm is finding out how much I take and then taper with medium speed, till I hopefully kick it. Never tried it.

Please leave some advice and uplifting stuff, I need someone to give me some hope, that I wont be stuck forever with this disgusting shit.

Full disclosure: yesterday, I had one of the best days of my life. Mini road trip with my fianc√©‚Äôs family to their deer lease.

My fast taper was planned in advance because i knew my husband would be home for a couple of months. After 3 weeks of that I thought this is absolutely miserable, I‚Äôm down to 9 gpd and I‚Äôm just going to leap. So on Thursday afternoon April 2 i took my last dose (just a teaspoon at that point). I suffered some of the acutes within a day, day 2 was surprisingly not that worse (probably because i was expecting it to be awful!)  by day 4 i had diarrhea that‚Äôs just now easing up on day 8. Cold sweats and severe chills lasted the whole first 4-5 days. My sister ODd the middle of this week while already in the hospital for IV drug use complications. Her heart stopped 3 times, once for quite a while and she was in multiple system organ failure. I‚Äôm a state away from my parents but we were preparing to have her go home on hospice. Suddenly things started to go in an upward direction for her. I don‚Äôt know why... she‚Äôs been to 5 rehabs in 4 states and only even stayed through one and the day after she got out was found passed out with a needle in her arm. We don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôll make it out of the hospital or not but getting clean has just never been an option for her before - TRUST ME she‚Äôs had 10000 rock bottoms, it doesn‚Äôt phase her. 

I‚Äôve never touched an opiate, i have anxiety problems and POTS so I‚Äôm on some meds for that and really have to take care of myself. Big shocks to the system hit me hard. The days we thought she was gone, i was on the phone all the time, took off work, cried, expressed anger and guilt and all of it. Now i have to go on with life. I have two little kids, a job, and a deployable husband. It‚Äôs day 8 and I‚Äôm just so bummed that i feel almost worse than day 2. Diarrhea is easing up as well as the night sweats and extreme discomfort/restlessness at night, but i am so tired. I am SO damn tired. My husbands on duty today i have the kids alone and every time i stand up I‚Äôm so dizzy. I‚Äôm trying to hydrate and today forced exercise. 

Please, tell me how to do life like this. I honestly wish i were in a rehab facility where my sole purpose would be getting better. I know that sounds awful. Maybe some would say now isn‚Äôt the right time to quit and i should give myself some grace. But in my life, it‚Äôs NEVER the right time. I had to do it and i will stick with it. I know i won‚Äôt feel normal right away... but i feel like I‚Äôm more tired every day.

I did pills, smoked weed, drank, hallucinogens, uppers, whatever from about 15 to 22 when i had my son and moved to california to be in his life.  At that time I didnt have any friends because i just moved here from WA.  I was living with my sons mom and her family initially.  I didnt know where to get any drugs down here and didnt want to mess around with sketchy people.  Soooooo I got a medical card for weed, got a doctor to prescribe me ambien, and bought alcohol.  Everything was super stressful because no family or friends for support and me and baby moma didnt get a long.  and my dad just got a sex change.  that kinda fucked me up.  so i relied on chemicals like always.  and like always they messed me up and i destroyed a lot of relationships and myself.  I moved out of my sons moms parents house and bounced around california place to place always visiting my son a couple days every week.  Still getting messed up drunk.  I was drinking at my work (line cook) and driving home blacked out more than a couple times.  Crashed my car (dont remember), stopped seeing my son, treating people horribly.  Alcohol turns me into a nightmare.  I had been messing around with kratom too.  My life was a wreck.  Started my 6th rehab like 2 years ago.  Did AA and actually stopped drinking.  When i was in rehab this last time.  When i was 26 i knew that i needed to do something different this time.  I know that i like to have something i do every day.  thats why i liked drugs and alcohol.  i had heard of crossfit but didnt know what it was.  When i got out of rehab i bought some kratom and started doing crossfit.  I didnt drink, was making friends at crossfit, was doing crossfit everyday and getting pretty good.  my relationship with son and his mom WAY WAY WAY WAY better!  but i took kratom every day.  every day every day.  I felt like it really helped me and didnt feel like i was on drugs.  i felt clean.  but i hid that shit.  was not proud of it.  hated when my mom called and said she was proud of me.

I made a very low dose drink . I‚Äôd say like 1/5 teaspoon . Which I had to hide from my husband cause he is absolutely demanding that I stop taking kratom which I agree . It has made me a total see you next Tuesday . And all my withdrawals disappear . 
So I failed my CT on the very first day of quitting . Which I‚Äôve read the first day is the easiest but god if it gets worse than that I honestly don‚Äôt know if I can do it :(
I think I‚Äôm going to do a rapid taper .  
Yesterday was day one . I made that one dose at 5 pm
Today I plan to wait as long as possible to make that same exact dose 
And I‚Äôm hoping this helps me get through this crap . 
This is a huge difference from my previous doses. I still feel bad but not unbearable. Really doesn‚Äôt help that I have a toddler that refuses to ask his dad for anything . He always wants his mommy and always always runs through the house like a tornado. 
Anyways my point is , is there any advice to this rapid taper ? Am I making the right decision by have that one dose ? Or am I just prolonging my problem ???",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.65706116}"

I have been on the kratom train on-and-off since 2015. In 2018, I started a job that I absolutely despised and ended up going back to kratom after a year of pretty much forgetting about it to help get through particularly bad days, after having been able to use it responsibly (5mg once a week at most) before, when I worked somewhere that I enjoyed and life circumstances were generally much better. As I'm sure you're all familiar with, this use at work became a crutch, and slowly grew into a dependency and addiction that I only fully grasped by last spring/summer. I'll never forget the day that I realized that I couldn't enjoy a day off without taking 30 capsules of this stuff.

Last summer, I decided to quit my job for a variety of reasons. Chiefly among these was quitting kratom, and I began with every advantage‚Äîtime, resources (money, an abundance of weed), support from my friends and summer weather. Suffice to say, I failed miserably. Many times. I'd estimate that I tried to quit cold turkey about 20 times between June and December of last year. Most of the time, it only took for 2-3 days, but once I made it for 2 weeks and it was legitimately beginning to feel better. But I threw that all away. I ended up going completely broke, and becoming dependent on selling possessions I really didn't want to part with to support the habit. The highest daily level I ever got to was about 30 mg a day, which I realize isn't too shocking compared to some people on this site‚Äîbut I was taking it all at once. 40-60 capsules at a time, coupled with a propensity for drinking (I also relied on kratom to cure hangovers) and generally not living the best lifestyle is not a good mix, and at various points I began to feel extremely dizzy and disoriented. I don't mean to be overly-dramatic here, but I felt as if I was near death a lot of times.

This year, I decided to take a different approach: tapering and cutting my doses. This was made a necessity by the lack of funds, health concerns and it just generally not being fun anymore. Since January, I have ebbed and flowed between 10 gpd and 4 gpd, which I am currently on. I began spacing out my doses to twice a day, which has helped immensely to stave off the worst of tapering. I believe I've come a long way, but the jump has eluded me to this point. But I have further complications. With the dawn of Coronavirus, my usual shop shut down and I was forced to start buying from a different vendor who has much lower-quality product that has been known to have more adverse effects on me than the stuff I usually buy. It's generally unpredictable, as today I took 4 capsules at 3 PM and felt fine, but last night took the same dose and felt extremely disoriented, like a much milder version of the worst of my heavy using days. 

So this brings me to my questions: Has anyone else experienced these symptoms at low doses, and if so, were they any cause for concern? Is this the natural outcome of abusing something like this for so long, the effect of using garbage product, or could it be pinned onto other substances (I occasionally use benzos, and have a bit more than usual in the past week, and I drink regularly, but I haven't been really drunk since last weekend)? And in general, if anyone out there has successfully tapered, what can I expect once I finish my schedule and jump?

I am new to this forum and new to Reddit, but I'm not new to kratom. I've been using kratom daily for about a year and a half, at least three five gram doses daily. I have used drugs regularly in the past. I used to take adderall and cocaine daily in addition to alcohol and kratom, I felt like I couldn't function without all of it. When I changed my lifestyle, I stopped taking adderall and cocaine and drinking as much. Kratom was the vice (in addition to alcohol and infrequent phenibut use) that I kept for myself, and I've been so scared of losing it even though I know I need to quit at some point.

I assume I'm in the position many of you might be in: quarantine happens, and access is limited. In a lot of ways, I was grateful for the dilemma, I've been meaning to quit for months; tomorrow tends to be a moot point when you have addictive tendencies.   

I didn't try to preserve any of the remainder of my stash, on my last dose I took enough to get me sick, as I thought this might give my body some sort of aversion that would make day 1 without it easier. It did not, I was actually so pissed at myself for not being conservative. I was scared of the withdrawal, but tried to remain positive as it was inevitable, I couldn't go get any more if I wanted to.

Day one was fatigue, anxiety and indifference. I couldn't pretend to care. My nose was runny and I was sneezing constantly. I shit the constancy of a Wendy's frosty (thank god I made it to the toilet 90% of the time.) The best part for me through all of it, is that it got better. I COULD do it. The first day was the hardest. The second day was better than the first, and the third was better than the second. I think about it many times a day, but I'm okay. That's just my experience though. 

Full disclosure, I drink daily and have been taking phenibut near daily to cope. While both of these lower levels of anxiety, they havn't squashed my desire to take kratom by any means. 

I just had to talk about it somewhere. My roommates have no idea that I take kratom, and I imagine they have no idea what it is. I didn't want to tell them about it, and certainly didn't want to tell them I might be ""off for a couple days because of withdrawals."" This would spark conversation I don't want to have, because they wouldn't get it. I've been doing it alone and I just wanted to talk about what's been going on for me somewhere.

I just have not felt physically/emotionally/mentally well for about the past month - shortness of breath, constipation, the cravings for kratom, depression, anxiety.

I quit using alcohol about 10 months ago and picked up kratom shortly after as a supplement for dealing with heartbreak. I am very against anti-depressants and medications in general and wanted to go for something more natural.

It started out doing wonders. It was the only thing I could take to make me not feel like killing myself or crying 24/7.

I had a small panic attack when I threw all my Kratom away. I was surprised at how much it affected me to do that.

Two weeks ago I started a quick taper. I had been doing 25-30 gpd for the past year+ and for 7 days I took 4-7 grams/day, just enough to stave off the withdrawal chills. Last Friday morning I took my last dose of 3 grams and haven't taken a dose since then.

Saturday was a day full of massive stomach issues. I basically could not go further than 25 feet from a toilet at any time during the day. I took 4 grams of Imodium and things seem to block themselves up for a day or so until things returned to normal. I had slight chills/sweats as well, but nothing a sweater couldn't cure.

I have been a staunch believer in the power of exercise and supplements to get me through this. I bought new running shoes last weekend (I hate running) and each time I have Kratom cravings that feel almost too much I go for a run. I've been doing 2.5 - 6 miles a day. This has GREATLY helped with the restless legs.

Supplements:

**Every morning:** I make a shake with crushed ice, Metamucil, Protein, Collagen Peptides, Kefir and Mixed Berries. With this shake I take:

1. Ashwagandha (helps with anxiety/lowers Cortisol levels)
2. L-Tyrosine (helps with motivation/energy)
3. Mucuna pruriens (helps with motivation/mood/depression)
4. Fish Oil (helps mood and inflation)
5. Tumeric (helps inflammation)
6. Multi Vitamin (overall health)
7. Vitamin B Complex (a mix of B vitamins, B6, B12, etc. for energy)
8. Spirulina (helps energy and focus)
9. CQ10 (overall health and energy)
10. Probiotic (stomach health)

I make sure to drink 90-120 ounces of water per day. For work I need to take Adderall for focus. I think this makes the withdrawal/PAW mental issues worse (anxiety/depression/etc.), but alas I have no choice, at least I have been trying to limit myself from taking too much/more than necessary (about 22-30 grams).

**In the early afternoon I take:**

11. L-theanine (helps calm you down/fight the Adderall crash)

12. 2000mg of Vitamin C (helps with the Adderall crash/boosts immune system)

**At night I take:**

13. Magnesium (helps with restless legs)

14. Sleep Mode (buy this off Amazon. It is a GOD SEND! It is basically a bunch of different natural ingredients that help you sleep better in one pill)

15. Passion Flower (helps with anxiety and with deeper sleep - get ready for some vivid dreams!).

Other than the first day, the withdrawals have been hardly noticeable. I know this is a lot of pills/supplements to take, but I am only going to take this much through the first 25-30 days. Not to mention, on some of the supplements (like the Mucuna pruriens and L-Tyrosine, you're supposed to cycle on and off and not take every day for an extended amount of time).

I also start my morning writing in a sobriety journal that I keep next to my bed. I write in it how I am feeling, how I slept, why I am quitting, and my experience quitting so far. It helps me stay accountable and motivated along the way. Instead of going running, you could easily write in your sobriety journal if the cravings become too much and you need to remind yourself why you're quitting.

**Noticeable Effects:**

1. My mood has already started to improve. Granted quite a lot of the supplements on my list are supposed to impact your mood, but I am talking about the anhedonia/lack of joy or interest I've had in life for months and months on kratom. I am already wanting to start hobbies back up or start anew. I am wanting to be more social and can actually hold conversations without running to drink more green sludge beforehand (this was my crutch for social situations). Color is starting to come back into life whereas it has been a colorless dull movie for longer than I can remember.
2. My libido has started to return. When I was dosing a lot on kratom I could go for weeks without any interest in sex - without even jerking off. I would turn down bootie calls if I didn't feel like it and I barely had any desire to look at porn. Slowly over the past week I've noticed random erections starting to happen again and have been thinking of sex WAY more than usual.
3. My body has been feeling more achey than normal. This may be from all the running/exercise, but I think it is because kratom has been masking the aches/pains for too long and I haven't been listening/hearing my body. I am hoping this is just elevated during the withdrawal period and will go away.
4. I have been getting some random numbness in my body at different times. Sometimes in my fingers, sometimes in my arms, sometimes in my toes, or butt. Just weird. I don't know. Nervous system issues?
5. (This hasn't happened yet) I have had a receding hairline for the past 6-7 years now. I feel like it has gotten exponentially worse over the past two years I've been taking Kratom. It will be interesting to see if I get any regrowth.

So there's my story. I am still interested in what the next few weeks will look like. I am committed towards quitting once and for all now so I'll be here around on this subreddit.

I'm on day 17 of quitting an almost year long ~16 GPD habit. My acute withdrawals were mild in comparison to what some people here report, and I've had only minor physical symptoms, but PAWS is hitting me quite hard now. The negative side effects of kratom have always been more mental than physical for me, and the primary issue has always been depression. I'm now struggling with low mood, lack of motivation, anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure), and severe mental tiredness. Ironically, some anxiety right about now would actually be welcome because it would be a nice change of pace from feeling like a zombie.

**Question:**

Anyway, what I find interesting about my current state is that these feelings of depression come and go. One hour, I will feel completely fine while working to complete the tasks on my to-do list without much struggle, but by the time that the next hour rolls over, I will have completely run out of fuel. Within a period of a minute I'll transition from feeling well to feeling like I want to die. During these periods, I drop whatever I was working on, because I can't bring myself to do anything. In fact, even watching a movie feels exhausting. If the feeling could be captured in a single sentence, then it would be, ""oh, what's even the point?"" In those moments, all I can do is sit, slouched over, with my face in my hands, or lie down on my bed. Sometimes, my mood will change even quicker: not just from hour to hour, but from minute to minute.

I never had a problem with drinking, but I quit alcohol too for many months as I didn't want my addiction to transfer. Unfortunately, with the fucking isolation from the pandemic, I started allowing myself a little bit of wine here and there as my wife always likes to have it around, and I've been bored as hell. After a while, the little bit of wine has turned into about a bottle of wine each evening, sometimes a little more. Now, the dragon is awake again and I am feeling the same discomfort that is only satiated with using, but it's with alcohol and not kratom. I am so happy to be free of kratom but I am terrified even more of alcoholism. I feel trapped and I don't know how to get out of this before it gets really bad (have only been drinking this intensely for a week or two, so I feel there is still hope).

Coming from someone who has withdrawn from nearly everything, this is up there with some of the hardest stuff I've ever had to come off of, the only drugs that were worse being Phenibut and Meth.

Eventually I gave up on trying to get sober and decided to stick with kratom, thinking that my mental health issues were possibly so bad sober that I needed something to keep me ""level"". I didn't know that mental withdrawals could persist for months after the last dose and that seems to be what was keeping me stuck in this hole. Slowly but surely, 3 grams was not enough, 6 grams was not enough, an ounce was not enough until I was going through a quarter of a kilo in a day and a half. These past few weeks, having no other option as I'm out of a job at the moment because of corona, I quickly cut my dosages in half, then into quarters over the course of a couple weeks, and it was pretty excruciating. I ended up getting kicked out of the house I was in because the withdrawals were so bad and I threw a literal adult tantrum and threatened a roommate. 

So I guess this would be my bottom, but I started drinking again just to get through the pain of cutting my doses. Last dose was day before yesterday, a friend of mine gave me an 8 gram dose. I also purposely spent all of my money that day so I couldn't buy any more kratom, drinks or even tobacco. Haven't had any since then and it's been incredibly rough. The fatigue, nausea, RLS and cold sweats have been awful but what really really sucks is the inability to feel any kind of pleasure, and that's the feeling that lasts the longest.

Idk what to do here but I guess my only option is to get through this without the aid of any kind of substance. I feel like my best shot at actually finding happiness, to stop being a parasite and actually contribute to society, is to go a long time without any sort of substance. I guess this coronavirus stuff is a blessing in disguise for a lot of us. Lockdown, no money, store closures, it's given a lot of us broken people a chance to really get our acts together. This is incredibly painful for me but it's an oppurtunity that must be seized if we hope to get better.

I was at 120gpd and I cut it down to a54gpd overnight. I can already feel the withdrawal lurking around me. 

My heart is racing throughout the day at the end of the dose. My anxiety is a fucking beast, and that beast is rattling the cage.

However, I cut back over 50%. I haven‚Äôt had a cup of coffee in 4 days either, which seems stupid, but I loooooove coffee. I was addicted to that too at 4-8 cups a day. Those stupid Yeti mugs hold 2 kcups and keep it hot all day so I would just keep filling it up. Terrible I know, but I‚Äôm 4 days off that. 

I‚Äôve cut back on the Juul too. I‚Äôve had to because of the acid reflux. My chest feels like a bonfire and a hot one with every hit. 

If I like something, I have a very hard time letting go. Anything. I‚Äôve endured a lifetime of things I would never wish on anyone and if anyone is willing to listen, I could use some friends through this. 

I need people to talk me through it. Tell me I can do it and that I matter. Sounds childish and stupid but I‚Äôve never put myself first. I use kratom and all the other junk to numb myself out so I can take care of everyone around me. I suppose it makes me feel useful, wanted and important and without being a caregiver, I don‚Äôt know who I am, nor do I know how to let anyone really take care of me on a deeper level. I feel guilty for needing help or taking away from others. Like I don‚Äôt deserve it and I‚Äôm some terrible person. 

I know I‚Äôm not, but my brain is an asshole. 

If anyone is looking to help someone else out because it helps them too, I could really use it. 
I feel so alone in this. My husband is such a great provider, but not nurturing to say the least. 

I know day by day is what you‚Äôre supposed to do, but it‚Äôs also hard to do sometimes because life demands you plan ahead so much. Bills, commitments, everything seems too heavy right now. I wish I could just focus on myself and my family would just back off leaning on me so much. I really need to take care of myself for once.

First of all thank you to everyone taking the time to read this. I hope were all doing alright with everything going on! So I have been using Kratom for 3 years with a couple breaks in between! It started off as my tool to taper off of phenibut and then as a tool to cope with anxiety, insomnia, and stress and it worked wonders! But since this period of time I have learned to cope and I have grown in many ways that make me feel like I don't need it and it does not serve me as it did as meditation and mindfulness are my most useful tools now. I work a full time internship and I am a full time student which are both no longer going on in person so I feel this might be the perfect time to take a step back from the plant. I have learned that I struggle with very slow tapers, as well as going cold turkey and my biggest issue with my use is that I feel as if i need to dose every 8 hours, and that I need it to sleep as I very much dislike feeling of getting moderate to severe anxiety if I dont have it with me.  


So, my solution is to cold turkey to the point where I am comfortable with my use to atleast step back from use to some extent initially to make the last jump much easier! For me this would be the same way most people are comfortable consuming coffee. I plan to stop dosing at any time initially besides having a tablespoon cup of Kratom tea and then eventually working down from there. This way I have my first half of my day where I can easily focus and do schoolwork and get stuff done around the house. And then I have the rest of my day where I can take Agmatine, and possibly some other supplements (please recommend any that work for you guys!) as well as journal and reflect and maybe take a light benzo I was prescribed a long time ago for some sleep at night. Also my current dosing schedule is 3/4 of a tablespoon 3-4 times a day. I do wakeup with aches until I have my Kratom dose, and I really struggle to sleep without it.

&#x200B;

Questions for all of you with more experience than me!

Do any of you have any tips or supplement recommendations that will make this easier?  
How long will it take for the acute withdrawals are gone for the most part?  
Is this even a good taper idea? Since i'm not maintaining constant plasma levels will my body adjust properly?

I‚Äôm in pretty good shape and if all goes well I project I‚Äôll be off the stuff in maybe two weeks-ish.

Anyway I am trying out uldn this time around. I just want to give some info for other people interested in trying it. I have read everyone has a different reaction to it, and that must be true because 3 mcg definitely sends me into pwd, but 1.5 mcg does not (maybe slightly).

Everything I have read here says that 3 mcg is way to low to cause pwd but here I am. Had a terrible night last night as a result. 

But I‚Äôm wondering if other people aren‚Äôt experiencing pwd at levels as low as 3 mcg because they are taking a dose of kratom with their uldn or shortly after. My plan so far was to take uldn with no plan of taking a dose with it or in the near future. Then take kratom at a much later time only when I needed it. Last night after I realized the wds were too much and I‚Äôd never get to sleep I decided to take some kratom and I felt better but not great. Not as great as a dose that size should have made me feel. 

I‚Äôm also wondering if there are any benefits to taking uldn without kratom. Like...do you still get the same tolerance lowering benefits of taking uldn with kratom?

2020-04-08 10:53:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/fx7ubc/16_days_no_kratom/,16 days no Kratom,"Really something like 23 or 30 days, but I used heroin for two weeks when I first quit.  The withdrawals were practically identitical to the other times I CT'd from just Kratom with the exception of multi-substance cravings.  As I explained two posts ago, the Heroin wasn't doing too much except keeping me from going into Kratom withdrawal.  I nodded more on Kratom than the heroin.  Looking back, I much prefer the Kratom high.

I also quit smoking about a week ago.  Vaping too.  Basically everything except coffee is out of my system.  I feel a little better, but I'm still having serious sleep difficulties.  Everyday is a step foreward, but I think it's going to be about a month until I start sleeping soundly, consistently.

Symptoms: Cold-sweats (nighttime), chills (much less than first week), depression, insomnia, irritability, fatigue, and muscle aches.

Cravings are primarily for cigarettes and Kratom.  Heroin cravings were strong for 3 to 4 days after quitting, but are very mild now.  Kratom cravings are much stronger, but are primarily in response to a desire to reduce withdrawal symptoms.  

If people use Kratom instead of suboxone or methadone for self-medication in opiate dependance, it should be obvious that this is strong stuff.  Quitting Kratom for a week isn't really even the tough part in my experience.  It's around day 10 or 14 when it's bad because you realize just how long withdrawals last and how dependent you are.  I'm speaking on my own behalf.  I would like to take 10 grams tonight and get some rest and not have to deal with the set-back.  Unfortunately, that's not really an option right now.

Finally, a word to those just quitting.  Make sure your environment is right.  If you have zero accountability and easy access to more, I highly doubt you will make it 30 days.  Just don't underestimate this shit, it's literally the hardest thing I've ever had to quit.

Been taking kratom daily for two years : 30 gpd. My relapse was quite ugly and I very well could have died. I smoked so much crack for two days that I found myself caught in a serious schizophrenic episode for over 12 hours. I was really messed up in the head.. seeing and hearing people that weren't there. Could have hurt myself or someone else.

My brother has pointed out to me that through this year of sobriety I have had, I didnt actually do anything to stay clean. I put in no work. All I did was work (60 hours per week) and take plenty of kratom. Kratom was my crutch. I dont blame kratom - but I cant use it properly. So now here I am one year later and have not grown as a man whatsoever. Only thing that's changed is now I'm addicted to kratom instead of painkillers... and I have a little money saved up.

So I just flushed over a kilo down my toilet (really surprised my toilet drain could stomach all that green sludge.. took over 12 flushes)... and I've made a commitment to quit and start to find different outlets in my life to stay away from my old lifestyle. 

I assume the withdrawal will be quite shitty and will begin in the next 6 hours. Idk wish me luck I guess... I will try my best to eat well, stay hydrated, take vitamins, and get outside some.

Luckily, that's pretty much gone away, but there's still this lingering sense of anxiety that's still there that wasn't there when I was doing kratom.

My apatite has also been extremely low since I quit. It's better than it being nonexistent like it was during the acute WD symptoms, but I'm also wondering if that eventually comes back around.

I also have a super hypercritical family so I‚Äôm very apprehensive to be open with anyone, so please bear with me and be kind. 

Now because I currently have acid reflux/GERD (which I think is partially from the kratom, partially from years of smoking and now vaping and coffee) I‚Äôm taking 40mg of ER Nexium, 20mg of Pepcid and a range of 3-8 Tums a day to keep it at bay since I can‚Äôt get any help during this COVID-19 outbreak. The burning is terrible and I‚Äôm kind of stuck on my current regimen at the moment because cutting everything off during a pandemic is probably a bad idea. 

Scary shit. 

It‚Äôs amazing what we will do to cover up our pain and my story is full of it. Childhood family molestation, rape, physical abuse from my father who died at 43 after I had to make the decision to pull him off the vent, divorce from an addict (who is sober now and has been for years). I remained on Norco all through nursing school and very good a full time job. Someone had to take care of my little girls. My ex was almost homeless and stole every penny we had before I kicked him out. I was much more crafty with my addiction and thought I had it ‚Äúunder control‚Äù, but I couldn‚Äôt just quit my own habit. I didn‚Äôt have time to be sick. I couldn‚Äôt let my sweet little girls down even though I‚Äôve been killing myself daily ever since. Even if I was killing myself I had to protect them. My addiction is almost 15 years old and I need help. I‚Äôm honestly still angry that my ex was able to do years of recovery. I wish I could do that and have someone else take care of my kids all whim I didn‚Äôt give one red cent for my children. I don‚Äôt have that luxury but he fucking took it. I‚Äôm pretty bitter about that one. Sorry. Back on subject...

I used to take 4 Norco for the longest time, then 6-8 a day for years. Call me a baby, but I couldn‚Äôt handle the withdrawal while trying to function normally. It was hell. 
I took a medical leave from work because after working full time, going to nursing school full-time, and raising 2 kids by myself, once I graduated nursing school and started working as a nurse, I fell apart. I just couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. My magic pills became my kryptonite. 

I thought I was determined to get through the withdrawals, but it was absolute torture and opiates/kratom really show you how strong you are. I wasn‚Äôt-and I never made it through the full withdrawal. I searched and searched for whatever I could find to stop withdrawal symptoms. 
So then came gabapentin, Loperamide, clonidine-whatever I could get my doc to put me on and whatever I could do, I was taking a shit ton. It helped, but it wasn‚Äôt enough. I felt like a drunk basket case when I took too much Gabapentin to ease the symptoms. I‚Äôm not crazy about the feeling of being drunk. I still couldn‚Äôt function. I wound up in the ER from the Gabapentin and Clonidine because my pressure dropped so low. I will never forget the way the nurse treated me. I was so ashamed.  I didn‚Äôt care what I did! I wasn‚Äôt going to be treated like an ‚Äúaddict‚Äù every again even if I had to stay that way to appear normal! Tell me that‚Äôs not fucked up....uggh. 

Then after about 8-10 day of withdrawal, I found our favorite magical little plant powder and haven‚Äôt really looked back. Combine it with the gabapentin and I felt like a rockstar all over again. I never did go back to work though. I took a leave for medical purposes and haven‚Äôt been back. Was approved for SSDI. Been lucky enough to be a stay at home mom with my new husband. Our house is picture perfect, everything looks good from the outside, but my pain is taking over. Mentally and physically, it‚Äôs forcing itself out whether I like it or not. People just think my diseases prevent me from working. Ya, they just don‚Äôt know truly which ones.

I shouldn‚Äôt say that ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never looked back‚Äù. I‚Äôve thought about how to quit daily. I buy the bulk powder and I have a capsule machine I use every week, and I carry my kratom, gabapentin bottles and water with me everywhere. I never leave the house without those bottles and it haunts me everyday. 

I know this acid reflux is because of the kratom. I ate like shit for years. Lived off kratom, gabapentin and coffee. My body has had enough. 

I need a place I can go to and I hope this is the place. We live in a small town and I want to keep this away from the community as to not affect my daughters. They don‚Äôt deserve the criticism and ridicule because of my mistakes. My middle one gets bullied enough. This is the last thing she needs. 

The last time I tried to go through withdrawal, I failed miserably and that was years ago. I feel like such a weak waste of space. I could barely get up. I couldn‚Äôt sleep. Couldn‚Äôt take care of myself. I would take baths as much as humanly possible, falling asleep a few times in the tub because the scorching hot water was the only thing that helps the RLS. I felt every square inch of my body writhing in pain. 

I was thinking of taper dosing, but I get to about 70% and RLS, anxiety, the depression, all that unbearable childhood pain floods me, heart racing 24/7, the guilt, the aches and pains, being unable to move but can‚Äôt stop moving, but OH SO sore and tired and pissed off, and of course the inability to think straight all kicks in and I end up giving in to the devil. Now I‚Äôm seriously worried about the acid reflux causing problems too and my thyroid is out of balance again as well. 

I could barely get on my phone last time to write anything like this while I was in any form of acute withdrawal. My attention is so short. Writhing. That‚Äôs the best word to describe it. 

I‚Äôll take any advice. I want to be free from this and be a better mom and wife. 
I don‚Äôt even know who I am sober anymore. My husband and kids don‚Äôt know me sober either. 
I‚Äôm going to die like this if I don‚Äôt do something now and if I don‚Äôt, I feel like I‚Äôll never beat it. My hair is getting so thin and my health is deteriorating. I need help. Please. 

I‚Äôm going to be by myself with 3 kids very soon. My oldest drives so that helps. My husband works out of state for months at a time. He will be 18 hours away after April 17th until late July. I have to go with him when he leaves to help set up his rental, then come back home, then head back to him with the kids to hang out for a month or so. Before I have to drive our three girls there, I have to take care of a 4000 sq for house inside and out, homeschool, 3 animals, pay bills (ha! Sitting down to concentrate is hilarious while in w/d) and everything in between. It‚Äôs a lot of work. 


How do you function and do normal life stuff through this?!? I tried for about two weeks and failed, I‚Äôve never made it past that. 

Anyone have a taper program that still allows you to have some level of concentration? My life won‚Äôt allow CT, even in a damn quarantine. 

The best thing about kratom and any opiates was the ability to feel like a super person. I didn‚Äôt feel much pain and I could just keep going throughout my day. I didn‚Äôt realize how much it slows me down cognitively until I‚Äôve been sober for awhile (been years since I felt that). Then when I‚Äôm sober I feel so dumb for believing I‚Äôm some super person, but I‚Äôd go right back to it for the pain relief and ability to do whatever job I needed to with a good attitude and less insecurity instead of dragging through the day soooo slowly. 
Well, it‚Äôs caught up with me now, and everyone has to pay the piper at some point. 

I have to stop. I‚Äôm afraid I already have holes in my esophaguses and stomach. I‚Äôve already started cutting down, and I‚Äôm trying to start an alkaline diet too. I can‚Äôt eat anything acidic anyway. Cutting out the vaping. Doing it all slowly though and I feel like I don‚Äôt have enough time to do it slow, yet can‚Äôt do it fast either?

I know for sure I am done and have no craving/longing to go back. However since I jumped off my taper I have been taking roughly 8-12 2mg immodium tablets once every morning. I have skipped a day or so here and there though. I only take it when I‚Äôm starting to feel uncomfortable, which primarily happens as soon as I wake up, and it doesn‚Äôt get me high by any means, the restlessness just happens to go away. It could be so totally in my head though because my brain knows it has opiate properties. Also my symptoms are way way less worse in general than it has ever been and I‚Äôve been as healthy as I‚Äôve been in years.

I‚Äôm wondering if the loperamide is really that effective that it‚Äôs just been hiding the withdrawals this entire time? I was under the impression that you needed to take way more to get high off of it. Should I just start taking 2 less every day from here on out and just do a loperamide taper? This is really frustrating, and I really hope this isn‚Äôt the case.

Long time reader, first time poster. Off and on kratom use for about 3 years, started as 2-3 times a week and ended up becoming an everyday thing with occasional 1-2 week breaks. 
  The crazy thing is I never really felt withdrawal, a few chills here and there but nothing super noticeable. The main reason I stopped is because about 2-3 weeks ago it started affecting my sex drive. Not worth it to me to keep doing. It still isn‚Äôt back to normal even on day 13, where before after quitting for 2-3 days I was back at full mast. 
  I think there‚Äôs definitely a length of time thing with kratom where you can overcome the affects on sex drive if you‚Äôve only been using for a year or so, but once it goes over a certain length of time a switch flips. Now I‚Äôm trying to flip that switch back. I‚Äôm active, in good shape, and eat healthy.
  Anyone with similar history that can tell me how long it took them to get back to normal?

For those that missed it, this is a friendly reminder that there is absolutely no quick fix for Kratom withdrawal.   Why does anyone think there are so many relapses?  It‚Äôs because our brains have become so used to their fix, that when they do not get it they cause havoc on our entire systems, including and maybe most importantly, our psychological eco systems.  

Sure, the acute physical withdrawal symptoms may dissipate quickly, but the psychological issues can stick with us for a very long time.  Months, or even longer.   And to not have realistic expectations cause many people to give up and relapse.  

If everyone understood that years of feeding our brain toxic drudge takes more than a week or two to undo, the chances of relapse would reduce drastically.   

Be realistic friends.   There are no quick fixes to drug addiction.   It‚Äôs that simple.   Know that going in and you‚Äôll have a better shot as success!!

I took kava kava that you can buy at mother's market and believe it or not,, kava kava, and ashwagandha  for a week with no withdrawal symptoms...and believe me, I've kicked heroin so I know the symptoms and from quitting kratom attempts before I can tell you they are earily similar...so after the first week of only changing kratom consumption in my life, everything else the same..my haircshedding slowed...and by the end of the month, it stopped, by month 4 It filled in, but It was a lot of hat wearing till then. So if you're lucky enough to be able to consume kratom every day and not have this issue, hats off...pun intended..but if you like myself and you take kratom and your hair is falling out...get some kava, from sprouts or mothers and get off the shitty herb...and another note, opms shots are made in u.s. with batch numbers and lot numbers and are screened for contaminates, I say this because a lot of advocates like to say its tainted...this brand is elite kratom extract..sure I took a lot, sure maybe if I took barley none it might of slowed the hair loss...but either way, it happened to me and that's a fact...only you will know...quite the kratom, and take your life back",27,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5741385}"

Since getting locked down it's gotten much worse. Now that I'm not working or going to the gym or seeing friends I have no impetus to take low doses to maintain lucidity. I've been taking 50-70 grams daily for probably two weeks now and my tolerance is absolutely fucked. I can legitimately take 30 grams and get no noticeable effects besides that alleviation of withdrawal symptoms. I've been saying 'tomorrow I'm gonna cut back' for weeks now and I never do. I tell myself I'm only gonna have 2 tbsp in the morning, but then an throw an extra one in, and then half an hour later I say what the hell if I have 2 more that would still be way less that usual so I do that. Then I'm at 5tbsp and I think 'well I've already used so much, might as well take 2 more to really get some effects' and then sometimes I have 3 more after that. I've been barely eating, lost about 15 pounds in a month or so.

I quit drinking, I (nearly) got off Prozac after a long long time, I didn't need (as many) opiates for constant kidney stones.

Then shit hit the fan at work. I got f'd over. 

I've been trying to dig myself out of this hole since. Getting off Kratom, when I've been dosing literally by the spoon full (I still can't estimate how much a day, maybe 20-30 g based on the kilo bags I was going through) because it helped.

I had to quit cold turkey once because of a massive screwup on my part and overseas travel. And I went of antidepressants cold turkey. And I nearly ended up dead.

A week into quarantine I decided... enough. So I stopped. And the RLS hit, so I started searching. Rather than tapering, I took the absolute barest minimum I could toss on a spoon- maybe 100mg- and some Phenibut, and some L-thia. It was enough to get me to sleep... at 0200, for about 4 hours. 

So I waited again until the anxiety and restlessness got too bad, about 24 hours later, and did the same small tap of kratom. A little less pheni (75mg), a little less L-th. 

And then about 30 hours later... and then about 50 hours later.

So right now I haven't had any. I'm looking at it and wondering if I could do it again. Just a small dose. But no, no I can't. Not yet. I've not even made it a week yet.

Opiate addiction took two years to kick and was a hellish withdrawal. Kratom took a year, and was fairly easy in comparison because it made me very ill over time, so I had no choice in the matter. Fast forward to now, after having been off of kratom for 6 months, I tried extracts one day after a very difficult day at work. They remind me more of pain killers than kratom.   


I immediately knew if I didn't control myself I would get addicted again. I limited myself to around once to twice a week, with at least 4 days inbetween. Reason i'm making this post is because, despite not having withdrawal symptoms when I stop, It's still fucking up my life. This is partly a warning and partly asking for advice. I have no issues spacing out my usage and thought I would be fine so long as withdrawal symptoms didn't show up. I messed up once (using two days in a row, then one day off, then more the next day) and had some mild restless legs and anxiety for 3 days. But even keeping it down to once during the weekend, and once on wednesday or thursday, despite not being ill on the days inbetween, i'm developing some annoying issues. I care very deeply about my physical fitness. I've stuck to a strict diet since I was a teenager because I was fat in my teens and hated it. The days where i'm not taking extract have started to turn into an absolute compulsion to eat. I eat 1800-2000 calories a day, normally. I have done this for years and almost never had problems sticking to it. Now, on my sober days i'm averaging 4000-6000 calories, and then barely eating on my extract days to make up for it. I'm not gaining weight quickly but I am putting on a little pudge which is depressing, because I've essentially dedicated the last 7 years of my life to being physically fit. The other issue is, despite being able to get through work easily on my off days (i never take it at work), i have very little motivation for anything at home unless it's an extract day. My apartment is a mess. On my days off I have to force myself to shower. And I feel like I can't enjoy my hobbies, unless it's an extract day. I also don't sleep very well on my sober days.   


Keep in mind, this is all with ZERO withdrawal symptoms. Reason i'm posting this is because I wanted to warn people who think they can maybe space out extract and avoid withdrawal. Negative aspects will still come for you, withdrawal or not. I also wanted to ask if anyone knows of any good ways to beat the desire to continue taking it.   


I'd always thought withdrawal (from opiates, kratom, etc) was the thing keeping me using. But now I realize it's more so that I can't enjoy myself without it. Every day that i'm not on it is spent waiting for the day that I can take it again. The only time I do my hobbies is the days that I take it. It's excruciating and I feel like I can't live life without it. I wonder if this is mental or from kratom itself. Opiates made me feel similar in the past, but getting through the withdrawal made the feeling go away. I've gone two weeks without my twice weekly extract doses and still just felt like I couldn't enjoy myself. Any advice for quitting entirely would be helpful. Even properly managed this stuff ruins my mood and ability to function.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.71252996}"

I started taking Kratom in early 2014 and I quit in late 2017, successfully with almost no withdrawal. I did taper and use several supplements to help with mood/anxiety, etc. and I did taper for about two weeks using stem and vein as well. I attributed the ease of my withdrawals to the supplements and taper. Difficulty was 2/10, mainly just some minor anxiety the first few days.

I ended up going back to Kratom unfortunately a few months later out of boredom and life dissatisfaction. Started small, eventually became a daily doser again. And so it‚Äôs been about 2 years of daily use now and I decided to quit about 2 weeks ago. The taper I did this time around wasn‚Äôt as long, and I‚Äôm not taking as many supplements. But I am doing things pretty much the same way.
Taper, stem and vein, supplements, etc.

This time. Once I switched from Kratom to stem and vein I had physical withdrawals for several days. And trouble sleeping. The physical w/d went away after about 5 days, but now I have pretty bad insomnia (something I never had the first time I successfully quit). So I‚Äôm thinking to myself, why am I experiencing these side effects? This never happened the first time around.

After much thought. I am 95% certain that the reason why this time was so much more unpleasant was due to the ‚Äúpotency‚Äù of the Kratom I‚Äôve been doing. Back in 2017, at the end of my Kratom run, I was buying stuff from a random guy in Indonesia . It wasn‚Äôt the strongest stuff but it was sufficient. So when I switched from Kratom to stem and vein there wasn‚Äôt too much trouble, just noticeably less effects and some anxiety while tapering. 

This time around however I have been using much higher quality Kratom, I ended up finding some anonymous vendor on a Kratom forum and purchased stuff through email, and the potency of this Kratom was almost as strong as the stuff I was getting when I first began. Or at least that‚Äôs how it was making me feel when I first started with this new vendor. 

I‚Äôm not sure if my recent vendor has been adding extracts to his stuff, or if his product is just legit higher quality. But I am almost positive that the reason why I‚Äôm having a difficult time now was due to how strong his product was.


I think it would‚Äôve been wise to find a Kratom that was ‚Äúin between‚Äù the potent stuff and the stem and vein; rather than just jumping from high quality to stem and vein. I had no idea that would be so important though. 

But I‚Äôm writing this as a heads up for anyone that wants to taper.  


And as a side question, how long does the insomnia/sleeping problems typically last? It takes me several hours to fall asleep. And I end up waking up like 4 hours later unable to fall back asleep, the sleep deprivation is really getting to me. Makes life so much more stressful. In 2017 when I quit the first time my sleep was grade A. No trouble whatsoever. I really regret coming back to Kratom. But I guess I had to learn the hard way.

Just a little background about me. I've only done kratom at all since December. I just kinda liked the feeling and thought little of it, I was usually taking going through one of those 500 capsule bottles in like a week. Then I moved for my job in January, got sick on my way out there. Really, really sick, had a rough first day of work then went to the doctor, which just got me anti-nausea medicine. Never realized it at the time, which was odd: I had stopped taking kratom when I left, meaning I went through withdrawals (lasted a week at most, no adverse effects after).

&#x200B;

My dumb ass didn't put two and two together by mid-February, so I drove by a place with kratom and was like ""Hey, that stuff was pretty cool!"" Got hooked again and was taking more, like one of those 1000 capsule containers a week. I tried quitting again once (the point I realized that I had withdrew once before? When I got sick the exact same way on Day 3 of CT) and was nearly through the physical conditions when I pussed out and bought again. My habit is lower at the moment, but I'm nervous I'm going to screw up again.

However I'm looking at this as the perfect time for me, as with the headshops closed I can't buy anymore and I don't really know how people order it online, so I'm slowly using less and less capusles a day as my stock grows thinner. It's seemed to work so far. I guess I haven't been addicted that long and my story isn't that bad, but I'm still nervous. Wish me luck on kicking this!!

&#x200B;

P.s. And I didn't even buy the kratom due to cravings or withdrawals or anything else when I got it the second time. I just remembered I liked the way it felt, and hadn't wanted any after my week of withdrawals (or even during withdrawals oddly enough. Like I didn't even think about buying more kratom. This is such a weird addiction).

I'm going to preface this by saying, my story may or may not be common, I'm more than likely on the extreme side but nonetheless, I wanted to share my story...not to scare anyone but my hopes are to keep those of you who have quit clean, and those working on their quit motivation to keep doing so. Also to provide some advice. I've stopped Kratom a few times, while most have a harder quit each time they go back to it, for me it was the opposite because I learned from my previous ones what to and what not to do.

Anyway, kratom for me literally saved my life...or at least bought me some additional time. No, I'm not here to preach about how good it is, but it's part of this story so bear with me here. It was a miracle for me simply because it literally killed the voice I had inside that made me want to drink. I went into a deep depression after my dad was killed at a young age, drank 1 to 2 large bottles of 100 proof vodka a day for a good 6 years. I now have chronic pancreatitis as a result. That news alone though was not enough to get me to stop drinking and I continued to do so for 3 years after the diagnosis. I was in so much pain, doctors would not prescribe me pain medicine for obvious reasons, so I literally searched for the term 'legal opiates' and found Kratom. I was not expecting how amazing it would feel mentally,  so I started taking it daily and like magic, I naturally stopped drinking. I did not 'try to stop' or anything...the voice was just dead. </praiseover> Now fast forward two years...  


At this point, I'm where many of you are currently so won't explain that too much. I quit, went through all the hellish nights of RLS, Insomnia, temp changes etc...  and ultimately was able to stop. The problem now was, that the motivation kratom provided was gone. While drinking, I didn't care about motivation, but after having it back like that, it truly felt like emotionally going back in time. I was back to being a pessimist. Prior to my dad's passing, I was an EXTREMELY driven, optimistic (some times to a fault, but mostly not) and successful individual. While I was(and still am) successful (thankfully and another long story all it's own), my drive was gone and pessimism in full force. I tried various antidepressants, while some did help with my depression to an extent...absolutely none had any effect on my drive and future outlook. Soooooo, I started taking it again. Here is where shit must have gone really wrong....

I didn't stop taking the antidepressant which is an SNRI much like kratom, was also diagnosed with ADHD and put on Adderal. I still didn't stop the kratom. It wasn't until a few things happened that made me want to quit again, and to this day still clean. I started having the hair issue I read about so often. I wasn't losing hair, but it became extremely brittle and damaged to the touch. It was so bad, my hairstylist noticed. I also started getting these strange skin tingles. They feel great but unnatural. I get the same feeling coming up on MDMA actually...and now ONE of the worst parts as if the hair and dependency itself wasn't bad enough.... I noticed if I'm in a quiet room, and there is a sudden noise...I'd get what feels like a jolt of electricity to the entire back portion of my brain, with a pain in my ear drums. Not brain zaps from an SSRI...in comparison to those who know what brain zaps are...it's the difference between getting shocked by someone due to static build-up, and getting shocked with 110v. It also feels like when someone or something startles you...I get a flash surge of adrenaline you know that..'HOLY SHIT YOU SCARED ME' feeling? Exactly that...only without actually being startled mentally. I myself can make the noise (the sound of my mouse clacking against the desk from repositioning it for example)...it doesn't even have to be noise...it can be my phone vibrating unexpectedly...and the sensation would happen.

&#x200B;

Now the worst part about all of this...even though I've been clean for 6 months...the skin tingles, and the brain jolts + super sensitive to certain sounds is just as strong today as it was then. My neurologist says the sound issue is probably due to low seratonin. As such, I went back on the SNRI, not only that we went to the strongest does. While it did help..it did very little...which kind of proves he was right about it being seratonin. The issue now is...no one knows for sure what's happening to me any by the looks of it, it 'appears' this problem I have is permanent. It's well documented that kratom plays havoc on the nervous system...but there is no such documentation on what damage exactly and/if said damage is permanent.

&#x200B;

Either way THIS SUCKS!

&#x200B;

My suggestion though for those quitting. If you can START ON AN SNRI before or half way into your quit. My 3rd quit, I started the SNRI after reading someone say this same thing, in this same sub, and it virtually eliminated all PAWS! Just ensure you do stop and not take both...I made that mistake and compounded it with adderal. That's WAY too much dopamine utilization",8,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4414274}"

New here.

Story similar to many. Tapered off Heroin with Kratom which actually made withdrawal almost painless. Was sober for couple of months then decided to use Kratom occasionally. Obviously this failed and here I am. Habbit about 35g-40g a day but tapered down to just 0.3g caps 4 or 5 times a day so 1g-1.3g a pretty small amount. 

To be honest have had 6 hours of sleep since starting the taper which is not bad and mild restlessness and chills. All very bearable. Having been through some nasty CT wds have really wanted to minimise any discomfort.

Luckily I have 30 diazepam 10mgs and 6 300mg gabapentin's for help with this. Today only taken 1g total and tempted to see how I get on if I don't take any more.

I have been browsing the sub for awhile and found it useful so felt like documenting my own experience might be good. 

My taper basically decreased dose from 6g 4-5 x day to 0.3g 4-5 x day. Taking 25% daily reduction roughly. 

Feel better today than yesterday but know withdrawals can sneak up on you. Anyway, hoping this helps me stick to the plan.

Thanks for reading

*36 hours no Kratom update*

So after posting this decided to jump off and stop all Kratom. I think the initial 12 hours are being quite restless and bored. The habitual use makes your brain constantly tell you to just take some more.

The first night I took 20mg of diazepam and slept maybe 5 hours which is good for withdrawals as I am use to 20 minutes from other detoxes. 

The next day was lethargic and had a pretty shitty mood. That was the main symptoms all day. This again is unusual as thought would feel worse. No GI issues yet or nausea but zero appetite so having to try eat for the sake of it. Coffee definitely helps me during the day but probably isn't great for the insomnia. The second night (24 hours-ish clean) I took 300mg of gabapentin which knocked me out for around 4 hours. Went back to sleep for another hour a bit later. So again, not bad!

RLS is usually the killer symptom for me but so far has been extremely minimal. Actually had it worse on last few days of the taper. Now gabapentin definitely can stop them so this could be a contributing factor however at 36 hours in as I am now I have never had an easier ride.

36 hours is only halfway to the usual opiate style peak so not counting myself as lucky yet. Just thought would update everyone. Thanks for all the support and all comments. All greatly appreciated.",8,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.42719862}"

With Kratom though first of all i did not really think that i was addicted like with alcohol or stimulants until my supply was suddenly cut off and i had this strange feeling of panic rising. 

So because after quitting meth and alcohol I wanted to live a sober life and get back on track I wanted to stop taking kratom.
Anyways a week later I am lying in my bed with my stomach cramping and a depression similar to a hardcore meth comedown which is overwhelming to be honest :(. 

Does anyone have any experience with this stimulant + kratom combination? 
Is it possible that the year long abuse of not only meth before the habit has fucked my brain longterm and that is why the wd is so bad?

I've attempted to quit Kratom many times. Always tapering. This time, I went CT. Bc I usually am an all or nothing person, and it just seemed like the only possible way....

Here's my journey so far going CT---the good, the bad, the ugly. 

Should preface to say that every day, I've been taking 500 mg acetaminophen two times a day, 800 mg Magnesium Glycinate every morning, and other things I've mentioned below on certain mornings or nights. 

Day 1-- at hours 8-12 or so,  began to have off and on sweats, chills, several bouts of diarrhea, anxiety in waves, prickly skin all over (like, underneath), lack of energy, etc. 

By hour 15, I bought a liter of Pinot grigio and drank it ALL within a 2-3 he period. 

Surely, bc of the wine and the WD combined, became extremely emotional, sad, and cried a good hour in the bathtub. It was weird bc I never really even felt intoxicated. DEFINITELY felt the wine, but never drunk. It was odd. 

Couple hours later, I took MDMA. Pure from the Netherlands.  Was saving this for a special occasion, but hey, feeling like I wanted to die seemed as good as any  Fuuuckkk.  That took me into the early morning hours feeling great. üòÇ

Day 2 Woke up in the nice bubble the morning after MDMA always gives me. No real WD symptoms felt. This stayed this way till like 2 pm or so. Then started feeling kinda antsy, unable to be comfortable, but only mildly compared to Day 1 in the late hours. 

At 3pm or so, I drank an 8% beer (12 oz) every hour for six hours. Took a much needed nap halfway thru. Went to sleep and slept a night at 11. Woke up twice to pee, but not really experiencing the RLS and achy bones thru and thru like I have on previous attempts. 

Day 3 Woke up with a pretty significant hangover. Decided to not drink any alcohol this day. Instead, I just took Lions mane in the morning along w my other stuff I mentioned up top, also took a caffeine pill. Just one low dose. Just bc I felt like I had no energy. 

As the day went on, this day I would say was sort of like a day of relief. The caffeine pill gave me every for hours (I'm sensitive) and I just kept myself busy gardening, drinking lots of water, etc. 

By night time, I took another bubble bath, took ashwaganda followed by niacin, and at bedtime two Benadryl. Slept like a baby that night. 

Day 4  -woke up feeling like absolute death. Guess ppl are right when they say drinking alcohol only delays SOME of the WD. It was mostly just a very flat, empty, depressed feeling. Totally mad at the world.

It seemed odd that day 4 was much worse mentally than day 3. Could also have been from the MDMA tho. Idk. But either way, I felt like shit. 

I put my head down and did a lot of work for my biz, and rode the day out. At 4 pm, I went on a bike ride. Did some gardening, listened to inspirational youtubes. 

Took ashwaganda again followed by niacin, drank kava, and also a cup of Lions Mane tea.

By 7, I was getting sleepy like a NORMAL person, without having to take red Bali to come down from my green maeng da (which is what I did almost every day!!!). I watched a movie and at 11:30 I could hardly keep my eyes open. I felt like a normal person getting sleepy at a normal time for the first time in two years. I loved the feeling. 

Today, day 5- last night had the weirdest fucking dreams ALL night long. But many of them were LUCID DREAMS!! I am in total shock and amazement still. I've always wanted to experience lucid dreaming. And I've even done some things before sleeping many times to try to bring them on. But now that I think about it, every time I tried to do those things, I was sleeping with my body full of Kratom.

 This may not be a big deal to you guys, but this put fire under me to keep this no Kratom thing going strongly!!! Some of the dreams were centered around relationships I've had in the past that were left off badly (unresolved issues where a person has really hurt me and never acknowledged it, trauma I've held on to about something, etc) and I swear these dreams were healing for me. And lucid too! What a cool experience. I've never experienced anything like it. 

Today, I'm starting with a cup of coffee, a bubble bath (getting in the bath immediately upon waking up every single day has helped me so much. It's filling the void I used to fill w taking Kratom first thing upon rolling out of bed-- and I think it's SUPER important to replace one habit with another-- it helps so much. I'm an extreme creature of habit, maybe more than most???  AND my skin is undoubtedly feeling weird and gross and clammy and doing weird things. When I submerge in the warm water for an hour or so, it is gone for the most part by the time I get out), my magnesium, my Lions mane, and am waiting to see how the day goes. 

I must say upon waking, I feel like I am maybe 75% back to what I should feel like after the main WD are done. It feels pretty good. I'm encouraged today. 

Other things to note- just general--

Runny nose still happening lightly. Body aches still mild. Shitting is BROWN instead of green!!! (Started on day 3, have had green shit for almost two years), my skin feels like it's not nearly as dry as it was during the almost two years on K, I feel like a normal person with somewhat normal emotions starting to come to the surface. Nothing too extremely down anymore., Body still has waves of chills or hot flashes or prickliness (not nearly as bad as before but not pleasant) so I'm just trying to stay bundled up and comfortable. No tight clothes, etc. 

I was given two Xanax by a friend the day I told him I'm quitting. Haven't touched them yet. I've never taken them and have a healthy fear of them. I'm just trying to hold out if possible. 

Okay, there's my extremely long update. 

It's been a BUUUUUMMMMPPPPY ride, folks. That's for sure. But forward momentum is always happening each day. That's all I'm setting my bar at and I feel good about it.

Sorry for posting just 24h apart but I suppose [the first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/ftmt4n/5_years_hiding_in_a_bag_of_kratom/) was mostly about the backstory and prior week of acute symptoms, while today I feel so much better and have a couple optimistic outlooks I'd like to share.

First of all, as a quick recap I went CT Friday evening and posted yesterday that I was feeling a lot better Wed and Thu.  Waking up today (the following Friday) though, I realized how antsy I had been the last few days compared to how I currently feel.  After 5 years of use (and the 5 years before that you can read about in the previous post) I guess I have forgotten what natural baseline even feels like.  At the moment I'm guessing that I'm not yet back to that, but instead of dreading another day of pain it just leaves me optimistic for each new day to come.  I'm sure it's been mentioned before but I'd bet keeping a journal to track your hourly successes early on and be able to prove to yourself that you are improving over time would be a useful tool.

Secondly, tied into the optimism for tomorrow, is where my mindset has been the last few hours.  Essentially I'm imagining the social things (once this lock down ends and the summer weather is in full swing) that I'll be - for the first time in ages - sober for such that I am able to completely engage in them.  Hanging out at my local pub's patio.  Going up to my parent's cottage.  Taking dates cycling along the waterfront. And so forth.

I don't know why my mind was stuck in such short term loops (well actually I guess it is pretty obviously the instantaneous temporary reward of kratom that has been the focus of my life for years), but somehow everything seems so easily attainable at the moment.  Had to write something down so that if PAWs hit me (or I otherwise find myself hurting) then I'll be able to remind myself of how I currently feel and that it is possible to feel this way.  Figured I might as well share it with you aussi.

Don't give up comrades.  All that cliche bullshit about a light at the end of the tunnel, it being all in your head, mind over matter, each day it gets better, etc. are (despite being almost impossible to believe in the moment) actually pretty damn accurate in my experience.  A week or so of pain plus (presumably) a couple months of occasional struggles is the only cost for endless hope and potential?  How can it be so hard for human beings to properly evaluate that when in the midst of agony?

Anyway best of luck all.  I hope these words help a bit in the moment and that someday you come out the other side and see how true they are for yourself.  For now I'm going to keep on thinking about all the awesome shit I'm going to do this summer (assuming quarantine doesn't just last forever hahaha sob sob) and maybe visualizing the same will help you too.

2020-04-03 08:12:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/fu7bdu/need_help_about_quitting/,Need help about quitting!,"Hello,

I just joined reddit because I read some really helpful articles about quitting kratom. I made the decision to quit about 2 days ago where I guess I felt withdrawal symptoms in the morning. Also, I do not want to be dependent on a crutch to live, always having to think about taking kratom with me.

Originally I decided to quit cold turkey today. I just could not get up anymore. My legs felt leaden, every move was exhausting, yet I knew I could not go back to sleep. I had all the right symptoms (runny nose, sneezing, feeling hot then cold, sweating). I didn't know what to do, I felt too weak to take a call and it kinda stressed me that all of this could come across as a corona infection. Thankfully I am on sick leave right now but I don't know if I can go to work like this. I am on sick leave because I had mild gastointestinal symptoms on Thursday, I don't think it can be from withdrawal because I was still taking my Kratom dose Wednesday night. So I plan on ""blaming"" my symptoms on that when I get asked why I don't feel good. But, from reading around I guess the symptoms last longer than until Sunday, today is Friday midday where I live.

I don't know if I gave in or if I made a better choice for me: I took about a quarter of my usual dose around 2.5 hours ago. I still have the hot and cold symptoms, the weakness is endurable and I can think a little more straight. I decided maybe tapering is the right way for me. The problem is. I have NO fine scale and I do not even know my daily dose.

So my question is: Can you guess how much 7 (more or less) heaping teaspoons in a day is in grams? I know guessing is probably not the right way to taper but I am too weak for cold turkey. I am also aware that something like ""a quarter teaspoon"" is difficult to maintain the same over a few days. But I feel like I can to it, like I am not prone to relapse, because I want to quit, I am just too weak for the ct-feelings.

I started taking Kratom more regularly, from a few days a week to everyday during the last year. I didn't take Kratom in the years before but I tried it on and off like 8-9 years back.

My highest dose was now the 7 heaping teaspoons in about 6 doses during the day. About 7 months ago I was on vacation, I generally didn't feel so good that time, but I managed that week with only a little of my usual kratom doses and don't remember going through any withdrawal symptoms. I guess I upped the dosage and regularity after that vacation. I don't remember exactly but I guess this is when I started to consume regularly during the day and thinking I needed it to get through work days, off days, any days....so that was about 1/2 a year ago.

Does anybody have experiences with tapering more quickly, how long do you stick to a certain dose?

Thanks in advance, guavaa

spoiler alert! .. this is true story, without any positive lies. Remember that each person is different!

**Day 40-120**

Worste things was between day 40 - 120. My big problem was waves of  internal tremor and agitation + depressed feelings + panic attacks + social phobia. Problems to work and enjoy anything in my life.  I turned to God because at that moment I stopped being alone.  Praying and meditation are the key activities that kept me on the water.

**Day 120 - 140**

On mark 120 all is gone - except mild depression. I still have waves of depressed feelings, but it is weaker and weaker. Mood swings are still here, but it is manageable. I can enjoy gamming, movies, music, my work, friends.. no social phobia, no anxiety, no panic attacks. Now it is game of my mind.

I can drink some beers (2 beers is enough for me), I can drink cofee again without problems. I can drink wine (2-4 dcl is enough for me).

**Supplements now:**

* DAA + Maca + Ashwagandha: because of my hormonal inbalance (low testosterone)
* Multivitamine, Omega 3

**Key habbits:**

* **Sleep is the key** \- go to bed on 10pm ( I know that sleep is problematic)
* **Excercising** \- mood booster, hormonal booster.. HIIT (2x per day)
* Lot of **filtered water**
* Drink **herbal tea** \- camomile is my favorite

**Day 140 Summary**

I am not the same person. I think I will never be again. Kratom teach me lot of things. But this is not negative, tak it as possitive change.  I appreciate more of the things I took for granted before.  I'm more spiritually focused. Thanks to God I stopped before Corona virus pandemy!

I look forward to 6 months mark.. no more Kratom again!

So stay strong.. and again... thanks to community here, You are awesome!

Leaning over my desk.

Minutes away from my next Zoom meeting.

*No more dosing first thing in the morning,* I think. 

*No more quick-fixes before meetings.*

*No more K to keep me company at night.*

""Pull it together,"" I told myself and snapped back to reality.

I combed my auburn hair back into a low bun and wiped the tears from my cheeks.

*(And stop touching your face).*

The physical symptoms of withdrawal had subsided, and in their absence I was met with a magnitude of emotions. Every hour a new arrival.

But for the first time in my recovery process, I could finally label the most prominent one.

Grief.

The sorrow that comes from letting things go.

From shedding layers of an old identity. 

And the painful ache of boredom that lies in its wake. 

I want to imagine what my life could look like without this haunting desire for *more.* More coffee, more Kratom, more food, more clothes, more *this* more *that.*

Is it possible? Tell me, is it possible to find a bountiful stream of energy and happiness *without* seeking the next thrill or high?

I think it is. I want to believe it is.

I got maybe 6 hours of sleep between the two days I had RLS so bad my girlfriend wanted to file a restraining order lol. 72 hours at ten am I was at work, and let me tell you I've never been so happy for those boring ass simulations company's use for training because I was in a world of hurt, but staying busy somehow through. I finally broke down and got sleeping pills to help me get some kind of sleep. Day 4 was much better the antsy feeling went away the only thing that still persisted was the sweating, and the heart racing. Anxiety was present throughout, but it's not like I'm not suffering from that already. It was actually the reason I started in the first place.

My theory / question is you think because I‚Äôve been only using headship Kratom that this might be easier to beat. I‚Äôve read before that the smoke shop stuff is weaker than the good stuff you can get online. Was wondering if anyone would mind shedding some light on this for me n maybe others.

When my 2 children were toddlers I left their abusive father and went on to graduate Magna Cum Laude with Bachelor‚Äôs in accounting and mathematics so I am not a stranger to a struggle.

Turned into an alcoholic, drinking every night from Dec 26, 2019 until about 6 weeks ago.  Started to take kratom again after being clean from it for 9 months just to curb the drinking... seemed to have liver failure.  Then I decided to be brave and quit drinking for 6 weeks while continuing to use kratom, felt so much better at first.  But then about 2 weeks ago, I realized that krate had it's death grips on me again.

I did a quick taper, down 5 GPD from 35 (again, with the help of alcohol).  Got down to 2.5 and jumped off... I'm on day 4 CT, and today happens to be a very significant birthday for me.  I lost my mind yesterday.  I thought I was going insane, still am today.  I have never felt mental anguish like I did yesterday, and still do today... can't function.  Supposed to have dinner with family tonight, don't know how to do it.    


I'm not sure what to do.  But if I continue to feel this way, I don't think I'll make it.  I'm on day 4 CT I believe right now, I've never felt darker in my entire life.  The mental withdrawals are literally bringing me to my knees. 

Do I re-dose a small amount and try a slower taper, or ride through? I know the alcohol has to stop too, trust me... that's the root of all this.  The way I described it to people is that alcohol kills your body and mind, while kratom kills your soul... I legitimately feel like a monster.  I rediscovered Alice in Chains in a whole new light yesterday, listening to ""Over Now"" on repeat the whole day and night... and thinking that some people who have used the drug that killed Layne have written online that kratom withdrawals are worse than heroin withdrawals... this stuff is evil.

Freaked out about calling people over the phone.  Needed to wave goodbye out the window when dropped off at school. Etc. Etc.  Around 5th grade I had an epiphany about how to be confident yet honest and kind, and for years life was grand.  Friends.  Sports.  Girls.  School.  Looking back it seems like it was straight out of a cliche movie.

Then, about halfway through a computer engineering degree, massive depression hit practically overnight.  I had always been an extrovert, feeding off of interactions with others, but now I didn't have the motivation to get out of bed for the most basic of tasks.  Within months everything I used to define myself had unraveled and I found myself basically bedridden.  I'd pick up just enough work online to keep a roof over my head, and drag myself outside maybe once a week to the doctor or to buy groceries.  Therapy, meds, nothing seemed to help.  Years of isolation in a world before covid-19.  Until, that is, I discovered kratom.

Immediately I once again had that energy and contentedness I had been missing for years.  Cleaned myself up, got a job that I enjoy, made some new friends.  Kratom helped me claw my way out of a dark hole and I have no idea what my life would look like if I hadn't found it almost 5 years ago.  But now I want more.

Despite how much kratom was a crutch that helped me improve my life, it has also been holding me back.  Emotional highs and lows are stunted.  A friend mentioned that I would love quarantine as I'm such an introvert (usually content to stay home and play music/watch videos).  I've also never really processed what happened to my life before finding kratom.  ""Lifelong"" friends from before who tried to help me but who I haven't contacted in years.  I want to come out of this almost decade long dream (time depressed + time on kratom) and know that I'll have to soberly face what has happened to do so.

I haven't tried quitting kratom before, but spontaneously decided to do so last Friday evening.  48h over the weekend wasn't very pleasant physically (must have taken 50 scalding hot showers) but the raw over the top emotions I felt for the first time is so long were quite cathartic.  Sunday night I slept a lot better, but the extreme inability to focus with an important virtual work meeting Monday afternoon meant I took a couple grams to get me through it (fortunately didn't seem to reset much).  Tuesday and Wednesday have both been better, and waking up this morning I feel almost normal again (though admittedly it's hard to remember how that feels) and will just need to ween off the occasional loperamide I've been taking.

I hope that being off kratom I can really find myself again, and one day confront what I've experienced over these many years.  I think there might be a fair amount of guilt and shame on the horizon but I almost look forward to dealing with it and putting it all behind me.  It's hard for me to vilify the leaf too much as it did give me the impetus to start living again, but I guess many people realize that the life it provides is in the end only a poor approximation of the human experience.

2020-04-01 14:28:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/ft5obt/how_not_to_quit_kratom/,How not to quit Kratom,"So, after a year of a 30-60 gpd Kratom habit I was not getting the buzz I was looking for.  Waking up in the middle of the night, redosing, etc.  My life wasn't horrible, but I was struggling.  I wanted to quit and failed 2 or 3 times in a 6 month period.   Horrible, soul-crushing withdrawals, each time.  RLS, depression, sweats, anxiety, insomnia, everything.  My finances were deteriorating as well and I was panicking.

Enter cocaine.  And credit cards.  And being an idiot.  My plan was to distract myself with cocaine, women, and debauchery enough to taper my Kratom use.  Obviously that didn't work.  And yes, I am aware of how glaringly bipolar and irrational this was--in hindsight.  But I did coke for a month almost every day and started using even more Kratom to offset the effects. 

Then, enter heroin.  At this point I was at the stage in addiction where I knew I was hopeless, and it was just a matter of time.  Lots of lies and ways to cheat money.  Turns out that when I used heroin...I didn't need Kratom anymore.  I was quickly astonished though at how high my tolerance was.  And I know it was good stuff because my neighbor was smacked out off it practically drooling on himself and passing out mid-conversation.  That's how I know Kratom is no joke.  I jumped on a $40-80 day H habit, on day one, and was functioning somewhat normal, but still experiencing what I perceived as Kratom withdrawals at night.  This lasted roughly two weeks.  Coke and heroin... no Kratom.

8 days clean off everything today.  Ended up homeless, completely broke begging my folks to let me have a roof over my head and a bed to ride out the withdrawals, which they refused at first.  I basically went through delayed Kratom withdrawals augmented with H and coke withdrawals.  First two days in a Walmart parking lot, then the woods, good thing I had toilet paper and camping experience because my stomache was ejecting what looked like super neon green/yellow foam.  I subsisted on honeybuns, cigarettes, and mountain dew.

Kratom is a POWERFUL drug.  I know for a fact because quitting a Heroin binge and month coke habit was literally easier.  Really?  Yes, because here I am today clean off everything.  And I have failed so many times in the past at day 4-5 on Kratom.  The withdrawals are on par with hard drugs.  At least with street drugs you know the situation needs to be resolved at some point.  Kratom addiction is insidious and just goes on forever, the withdrawals last longer than things like Heroin too.

Don't get off Kratom like this though.  I could have died, hurt someone, or went to jail.  I am also completely broke, thousands of dollars in debt, and living with my mom.  Thankfully this pandemic kind of shields me from some of the responsibility.",66,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.53678125}"

Many of us injected drugs into our system for YEARS.   Our brains became accustomed to expecting its fix daily.   For those embarking on your quit, it‚Äôs important to understand the virtue and necessity of patience during this process.   I know everyone wants to hear how quickly the discomfort will have to be endured.   That‚Äôs human nature.   However, if you can realize that it takes the brain, and the rest of your body, a good deal it time to reset, your expectations will be more realistic and perhaps your frustration levels will be tempered.  

Everyone is different, and everyone has a different history.  There is no one set answer as to the duration and severity of withdrawal.  However, one thing is certainly true for all of us.  Quitting IS hard work.  It‚Äôs something that we can‚Äôt just think it will happen without having internal fortitude, strength, willpower, and a relentless pursuit of success.   It‚Äôs takes work and effort and incredible commitment to get to the other side.  It doesn‚Äôt just ‚Äúhappen‚Äù.   

Have patience and I would urge all who read this not to fixate on the duration or severity of withdrawal.   It‚Äôs a necessary evil that we all must endure, and the more we obsess about it, and dwell on it, the harder the whole process becomes.  

As I‚Äôve mentioned before on here, be proactive, especially with exercise.   Exercise is absolutely vital and critical to your recovery.   My personal opinion is that exercise is infinitely more important than any supplement, pill, or substance that we put in our mouth with the hopes that it will cure or ease the agony of withdrawal.   As I said above, this takes hard work.  Exercise isn‚Äôt easy.  Especially when we feel zero motivation.  However, it‚Äôs rewards are immeasurable.  Take the leap and go walk or jog outside.   I absolutely guarantee you it will make this more bearable.

I haven‚Äôt quit yet (I run a company & currently training others so I can step away) but I‚Äôve been cutting from a massive dose to a somewhat *normal* dose. Previous heroin addict so it‚Äôs difficult, & I‚Äôve turned the kratom into almost something worse. Picked up a 250mg tablet bottle from the grocery & I think it‚Äôs Magnesium Citrate, though it doesn‚Äôt really say.

I took the first yesterday morning & was fine, didn‚Äôt notice anything. Then read it‚Äôs better to take at night so I took another late last night after eating soup. At first I felt kind of a tingly relaxed feeling, kind of like how you feel for those 3-5 minutes after an orgasm. It was pleasant. Then a moment happened all a sudden where I caught myself not realizing if I was in a dream or actually awake. Things got weird, my vision & reality appeared like when you experience a very lucid dream. Images like the corner of the tv would stick in my vision when I‚Äôd look away & little distorted squiggles of whatever would appear as I looked around. I started freaking out & then ofcourse went to google & read too much can cause mental confusion, breathing difficulties, coma, & even death. 

I do have a panic disorder induced from previous drug experiences years ago so I am prone to panicking, causing my rational reality to become distorted. Thought I‚Äôm absolutely sure the magnesium induced the dreamy like confusion, but I‚Äôm not sure if my mind turned it into worse than it should‚Äôve been. I wasn‚Äôt in any state of panic before taking it, I‚Äôd already taken one 12 hours earlier so I knew I was fine, & i‚Äôve never experienced any anxiety over taking supplements. For about 30 minutes I was in a delirious state of not knowing what was going to happen or if I should go to the ER. I do think I‚Äôm fine today, perhaps feel great. Tbh the restlessness wasn‚Äôt that bad last night (if it had anything to do with it or not). I checked my daily vitamins to be sure it didn‚Äôt contain magnesium & it didn‚Äôt. Otherwise I was very sleepy already forcing myself to stay awake watching a movie with my SO. 

I would like to take it for a few beneficial reasons but now I‚Äôm scared & not sure. The only thing I know I might‚Äôve done wrong was also taken one that morning. But two 250mg pills spread over 12hrs from the vitamin section could cause that? I thought this was just something off the grocery store shelf, what could it hurt? At the least it just wouldn‚Äôt do anything, I‚Äôd think. Any experiences like this or other warnings?",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46783647}"

They lasted for the first 6 days, and I kept thinking that if this is how off my body is without kratom, I never want to do that toxic shit again. I couldn't wait for the day when I stopped feeling uncomfortable, could have an appetite, and sleep when I wanted to again. I have to say that on day 7, when that all came I felt better than I ever had an kratom. I did it. I accomplished my goal of getting through those horrible feelings so I bought myself animal crossing (it's fantastic btw) as a reward. I was feeling pretty awesome and energized until today (day 10). It's not nearly as bad as the first couple of days, but I can tell I'm starting an entirely new phase with this whole process. I don't feel like doing anything because everything sounds so damn boring. I feel so sluggish and dull. All I can think about is ordering some kratom to help the time go by, and entertain myself for a couple hours. Then that had me thinking about why I would use kratom in the first place. Maybe I'm wrong, but kratom never felt like it was filling some existential or emotional void inside of me. I feel like when a lot of people talk about drugs they always say someone does them because they're deeply unhappy or there's something profoundly missing. I don't/didn't feel that way at all. I'm actually very content with my life, and the only reason why I got into kratom in the first place was because it was something fun to do when I had nothing else to do. Like a lot of us on here that ""hobby"" grew into a monster that tarnished our relationships, motivation, and etc. It became something I'd do when I had other things I had to do. That's why I chose to quit. I suppose I'm rambling at this point, but I'm sure that a lot of other people are in the same shoes as I am. I read about several other people on here who actually quit on the same day as me. This is just my way of reaching out to you, and since you're probably having similar thoughts today just know you're not alone.

It's been a crazy few days, day 2-4 really really tough. I won't lie, this is not the first chemical to cause trouble for me in life and I've been through withdrawal many a time.  Kratom not the worst but definitely not the easiest, no fucking cakewalk. If I hadn't had a huge supply of hydroxyzine I would not have made it this far. The weird thing about Kratom, relative to hard drugs and alcohol, is how fucking sneaky it was.  When I found Kratom I thought I had found the key to clean and sober living: it's a stimulant, an antidepressant and a painkiller all in one and it's perfectly legal!  I used my beloved speciosa for several years and eventually knew I was hooked but I just did not think I could shake it. In a weird way I don't think without the pandemic I would have done this but I did it and I feel like I have landed on my feet.

     So my situation is a bit out of the ordinary.  (For me anyways).  I am an entertainer on cruise ships.  What was supposed to be a 5 day gig for me turned into what will end up being 3 months.  I ALWAYS have brought extra Kratom because as we all know how much it sucks to run out.  I would even pre wrap individual doses in tissue and put them in different areas of my carry ons etc...  Well,  with COVID-19,  I was informed that I would not be leaving for awhile.  They first told me 2 weeks.  So I thought,‚Äù OK, I‚Äôll have enough.   Then they said 2 months.  Still thought I‚Äôd be OK.  Hahaha WRONG!  

       I dropped from a 28 gpd dose to a 6 gpd overnight out of panic. Felt minor withdrawals.  Then ran out.  Nothing left whatsoever.  We are currently sailing from Australia to Hawaii for fuel then to Los Angeles where I live.  Won‚Äôt get there for 3 more weeks.  I have not seen land for over 30 days and people are wondering why I am so crabby and sweating so much.  

       I haven‚Äôt slept in a week except for 10 minutes here and there.  The doctor onboard gave me 5 Diazepam and last night and it was glorious as I was able to sleep for about 13 hours straight.  (I told him I have rls (which I do horribly but only because of my withdrawal). I have Modalert with me which I take during the day to muscle through and perform my shows.  But man oh man I didn‚Äôt expect this.  I have about 4 KG of Kratom in my home which will be flushed.  I am trying to think of this as a blessing in disguise because who knows if Kratom will even be available in some time?  
      
      I have been using for about 3 years daily.  Is this considered a long time?  Am I going to be miserable for months?   I‚Äôm In relatively good shape.  I‚Äôm a runner.  However now I can barely run 2 miles.  Runny nose, I sneeze all day long. Hot flashes, depression, i‚Äôm irritable, can‚Äôt sleep and horrible rls.
