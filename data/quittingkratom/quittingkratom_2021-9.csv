after lurking around, I've decided to share my experience/struggle.

Currently on a 2nd week rapid taper. Been using around 20-40gpd the past ~year, with a few breaks in-between (those types of RLS, flu-ridden ""breaks"" when you run out because of logistics). I now dose only upon waking up. Otherwise I won't make it out of bed. 

The reason being is I'm also struggling with a 3 year, heavy pot and on/off Pregabalin (300-900mg/day) addictions. I'm also 2 weeks off pot too. I can't and won't take Pregab out just yet, since I'm well aware of the risk of seizures. Not to fucking mention the rest of the withdrawal from it. 

It all started because of desperation, stemming from anxiety, paranoia and MDD, which is a whole different story.

Now, no one did this to me. I did this to myself. I take full responsibility for it. I'm doing the best I can to shoulder this burden, one day at a time. It is taking a huge fucking toll on my psyche. And body.

I have a responsibility to do my absolute best. Not only for myself, but also for my closest ones, goddamnit.

I don't know if I'll ever fully recover from everything, but you can be sure I'll die trying.

There's much more to tell, feel free to AMA.

Best,

Me.",9,0

I have mentioned in here before that I have been sober off alcohol for over 5 years so I‚Äôm no stranger to CT withdrawal and the whole process. I think that experience helped me out a lot. 

Day 1 - took way too much and my health had really been going down hill. I was at internship and thought I was going to puke in my colleagues car. Told her I was sick and I went home. I had the jitters and dry heaving and constipation issues too embarrassing to discuss (probably should have gone to hospital but I googled and gloved up and took care of it) üò≥ slept most of the day too afraid to drink more. 

Day 2 - realized I was pretty much 24 hours clean and that it was now Friday so I had the weekend to detox‚Ä¶. *divine intervention* felt icky but not super bad, just spent the whole day in bed watching crap. 

Day 3 - worst day ever! RLS, so much sweat! Shivering, sneezing, fatigue. Also watched crap in bed all day. 

Day 4 - was able to wash sweaty sheets and pj‚Äôs and make myself go for a walk. Super low strength and fever chills but semi functional. Was able to get some groceries, I live alone. 

Day 5 - it‚Äôs now Monday,  felt low energy and worked from home, went for a long walk in afternoon and ran .5 miles. Still sweaty fever chills. 

Day 6- first day back in the world, sweaty chills all day but otherwise fine. Walked awhile and ran 2 miles. 

Day 7 - mental clarity, lifted mood, gratitude. Ran 5 miles and biked 30 mins. Still slightly sweaty and minor chills. 

Here is a list of the things I‚Äôve taken in the last week I order from beginning to now: ibuprofen, pedialyte, one dose of kava on the worst day, 1/2 a hydrocodone split into 3 slivers I had on days 2-4 for the chills, powdered greens, protein powder, kombucha, NyQuil, delta 8 vape pen only at night to sleep, lots of iron for RLS. Lots of fruit and oatmeal, toast, eggs (sick people food) 

I strongly believe that exercise, healthy diet, and minimal (replacement) drugs is why I‚Äôm feeling so great. I was drinking about 80 grams a day for 6 months. Thanks for reading I hope this helps someone ‚úåüèºüòé this forum has been a blessing ‚ù§Ô∏èüíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",15,0

I used to work in the business and started using it that way. I've been able to get any kratom for crazy cheap wholesale prices and that's ended up being a huge factor in my use.

For the last 3 years I've been eating between 70-90 capsules or branded K a day, sometimes more. I'm sure as you can imagine, at this point it does absolutely nothing for me but keep me from going into WDs.

Before I started using K, I used oxys for a few years. At the end of that I was at about 200mg a day. I also quit that CT, and was out of commission for about a month. I was sober all of 6 months before I started the job that got me into K. In the beginning it wasn't remotely daily, in fact I had a very hard time seeing the appeal. 

I've quit K a few times here and there before with the longest time sober for about a month. I didn't even really want to or plan on quitting but I left to another country for a month, and I couldn't bring the K with me. I spent the first few weeks on the toilet before I discovered imodium. 

For the past year I've slowly been coming to realize I have to stop using K. So a few weeks ago I decided that once I run out, that's it. 

It's been pretty rough so far, but I've been through this before so I know I have the strength to push through this part. Some nights I can't sleep at all, even with melatonin, and just push through until the next night. 

My apartment complex has a jacuzzi which helps when my skin starts to crawl. My appetite has been non existant, so I force myself to eat a little maybe once or twice a day. 

I hope once the physical symptoms let up a bit, I will begin to feel a bit like myself again. These last few years haven't been great to me and I'm sure K use has been a big driving factor behind that. I want to start feeling motivated and normal again like I did before. 



I'm any case, thank you for reading and making me feel less alone with this. I love you all and wish you a good recovery.

Flew to the east coast where I‚Äôm from.  Didn‚Äôt think about Kratom at all!

I have relapsed so many times, gone through uncomfortable withdrawals ( was on high doses) and the difference now is I take naltrexone periodically ( was taking daily now a few times a week) as it helps me to know I will not feel that high if I do relapse. 

My life kinda stopped on Kratom. Hiding it, avoiding activities due to high dependency needs and all the other terrible shit Kratom does.  It wreaked havoc in every single area of my life!  

I will never not be an addict and am learning to accept it.  The consequences are great but with determination and getting off of this stuff over and over again, I‚Äôve realized it has made me stronger!  Everyone on here is remarkable!  No one signed up to get addicted to this and the bravery of everyone on here is outstanding!  It‚Äôs not easy to get off of any substances and quitting Kratom will open up so many doors to a better life!  Once off of this you can do anything because nothing is as difficult as getting off of drugs!  I‚Äôm in a doctorate program now and it‚Äôs a cake walk compared to getting off Kratom! 

It takes TIME!  The lack of motivation and energy in the beginning feels cruel.  It does pass!  As most people write, exercise helps immensely.  I could barely walk when I was detoxing but now I‚Äôm back to running and am grateful for every step.  I will say even walking around the block helped in the beginning! 

I had 5 plus months clean and relapsed for 7 weeks. Had to go through withdrawals AGAIN ( not as bad but still had to have 4 days of no work, plans etc‚Ä¶). Thankfully, I didn‚Äôt wait longer then 7 weeks as I don‚Äôt know how I would have had the courage to quit again.  My previous quit sucked!  I remember day 10 was really difficult and I didn‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd ever feel ‚Äú normal.‚Äù

To all of you who have slipped/relapsed, don‚Äôt give up!!!  If I can do it anyone can!  My habit was huge!

I‚Äôm super super surprised at how quickly I bounced back. I have to give some credit to having Gaba on hand, but I only take it at night when I‚Äôm sleeping because of the RLS, I don‚Äôt take any during the day, I just haven‚Äôt needed it.

The first two days were a little rough, I didn‚Äôt feel myself, was sort of out of it. Had absolutely no appetite, in a funk, the usual. I cancelled appointments at work for yesterday (day 2), just in case. I prob could have went in but wanted to be on the safe side. 

Today I went back to work, and felt completely normal. Yes, the gaba helps some, but only with certain withdrawal symptoms. 

I quit last year without gaba and while it was much harder, I also had a harder time mentally as well. I get absolutely no euphoria from taking gaba, it actually makes me tired and groggy. 

But I‚Äôve banged out workouts every day since and because I own a spa, I went in my infrared sauna today and sweat for 45 minutes. Been drinking a gallon of water a day and I‚Äôm hoping that kind of did the trick. 

I do want to say that I really think where you buy your kratom from also makes a difference. Last time I quit I had been using the local brands from a store down the street, and I felt I was using more and more constantly. This time I was using an online brand, and they were much stronger at a lower dose, so I contribute how quickly I was able to bounce back to that aspect as well.

Not saying I‚Äôm completely out of the woods yet, but figured I‚Äôd give some hope to some people out there that might be considering quitting but afraid to. Don‚Äôt be. The time is gonna pass anyway. Might as well get it over with and do it. Celebrate the new year kratom free. 

It‚Äôs so well worth it. And while I‚Äôm not üíØ I‚Äôm close enough and I‚Äôm happy I made that jump. The feeling is amazing, and no drug on earth can beat that feeling. Best of luck to you all. You got this üôèüèº",9,0

And I always used by 2pm. Here I am at 7pm. I don‚Äôt feel great but I‚Äôm gonna not have the guilt tomorrow 

2) Kratom is fucking awful!!!! I did and said some things to my wife that I can‚Äôt ever take back and I guarantee I never would have even considered thinking about saying if I wasn‚Äôt on Kratom. 

If you‚Äôre hooked on k you know what I mean‚Ä¶it‚Äôs like the devil or some other person just takes hold of your words and actions and you get so emotional and keep digging into‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶let‚Äôs be honest‚Ä¶nothing. There‚Äôs nothing on the other end of a Kratom user argument worth anything",9,0

I‚Äôve posted a few times since my taper began exactly 2 weeks ago. Pls read back posts of you‚Äôre interested in my career with K, dosing and length of time, etc. 

I‚Äôm at 5.5 grams from 16 grams two weeks ago. I‚Äôve been going kinda fast I guess with the taper. 

I decreased from 7.5 grams to 5.5 two and a half days ago. 

Today I started out fine, took 3.5 grams between 7 am and 1:15 pm (increments). Was planning on taking the other 2 grams over two doses by 5 pm. 

But at about 2 pm, I started having this really odd kind of I‚Äôm not in my own skin kinda feeling. Then I couldn‚Äôt tell what was happening but I started feeling really uncomfortable. Fidgety. Then slowwwwlly anxiety built up to the point that an hour later, I was completely engulfed in it. It came in waves. It came
with the TIGHTEST feeling exactly on both of my temples.  Just SUCH tightness. 

It‚Äôs still that way now. 5 hours later. 

Could I be in full blown WD even taking 3.5 grams today? I‚Äôm so confused. I have felt SO bad that I‚Äôve skipped my last two doses. I can‚Äôt even THINK of taking kratom right now. 

I‚Äôve read ppl say on here that they sometimes reached a point in their taper that they felt they were having WD all day everyday anyway so they jumped off at ‚Äúx‚Äù grams. 

But crushing anxiety like this? So soon? Like, WTF man? Am I just tapering waaayyy too fast? Why did they all come on like this this afternoon and I‚Äôve had very manageable WD so far?  To be hit with this? 

One more thing~ I took .25 mg klonopin for 11 nights straight. I haven‚Äôt taken it for 3 nights. Would this be from stopping taking them? Thank you! Any input is welcome. üôè

Edit- I just realized I took 1/4 of 1/2 mg of klonopin. So, 1/8. I have .5 mg pills and I was taking  1/4 of the pill.",5,0

Background: been using Kratom for four or five years daily, for chronic pain connected to tension that I‚Äôve recently begun to think is connected to somatic anxiety centered in pelvic region. I‚Äôm not sure how much I‚Äôve been using, maybe 2-3 loaded spoonfuls a day, every day. Over the past couple of weeks I‚Äôve cut down significantly, and finished my last bit two days ago.

I‚Äôve been feeling fine these past two days, no strong urges, irritability, anything. But in the past couple of months I‚Äôve started to recognize that I‚Äôve been severely constipated. 
The day after I ran out, that constipation completely stopped. In one day I went to the bathroom 3 or 4 times; totally unheard of. 

So today I wake up and I‚Äôm feeling fine, and an hour into my day I start to get this pain in my sacrum and pelvis. I can barely walk but if I‚Äôm laying down I feel totally fine. In terms of other potential symptoms of withdrawal‚Ä¶nothing, I feel fine. I know it‚Äôs only been two days, but I don‚Äôt have any urges really, just this weird pain.
Part of what makes it feel weird is that it almost feels like an ‚Äúopening up‚Äù of my pelvis, either related to my chronic pain, or to the sudden release of some kind of ‚Äúmuscular holding‚Äù relating to a sudden reversal of my constipation. I can feel other muscles in my body loosening and relaxing in ways that they haven‚Äôt really before. Even in my face, which almost feels ‚Äúconnected‚Äù to my pelvis, though I can‚Äôt quite explain how I recognize this.  Part of me feels like it‚Äôs the result of some kind of realignment in my pelvic region and the pain come from my body not being used to it. But the fact that it gets so ma ch worse when I try to walk, pick stuff up, etc. is weird to me and troubling.

Also travelled with heavy bags yesterday, so maybe I lifted them poorly at some point. But the bizzarre part is that the pain and weakness is in my pelvis/sacrum, and doesn‚Äôt at all go further up my back, maybe to first lumbar but barely.

Not sure what I‚Äôm asking for here‚Ä¶whether anyone has had a similar experience? Feel a bit like there‚Äôs too many particularities here to find anyone who can relate. In the past I tried to quit and it didn‚Äôt go well, psychologically and relating to my chronic pain/anxiety, sleep etc. Now I feel totally fine about it, except this exceptionally weird sudden pelvis thing.

Sorry for the slightly rambling post, I‚Äôm not sure how to best describe what‚Äôs going on, and there‚Äôs this insane lag in my keyboard when I try to write that I can‚Äôt really edit or follow my thoughts as I write without waiting a couple minutes for the text to show up lol. Z",3,0
35,2021-09-28 12:49:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/pxaj9u/feel_like_im_finally_free_but_its_about_3_months/,"Feel like I'm finally free, but it's about 3 months too late","I'm nearly two weeks clean and sober. I've been addicted to kratom for basically the last year. I've known it was a real issue and trying to quit since about January.

The anxiety during the withdrawals was terrible. But that wasn't as bad as not being able to sleep. I got into the habit of drinking to be able to sleep. Every time it made the withdrawals worse when I was sober again but I still did it. I got addicted to alcohol right as I got clean from kratom.

I relapsed hard with kratom due to increased stress from a couple different things. Over labor day weekend I was trying to stay off it and I was with my SO at her parents' beach house. I didn't have any access to kratom but I could buy alcohol by walking down the street. The first night there I got blackout drunk. By some miracle I didn't do anything embarrassing. Apparently I was actually fun to be around that night. The last thing I remember is the neighbor from the next house over saying my smile was infectious and offering me a shot of tequila.

The next day I was still withdrawing from kratom but I tried to ignore it. That night I woke up at like 1:00 am and wasn't able to sleep. That's always been a really dangerous time for me. I can go to some pretty dark places when I'm alone with my thoughts in the middle of the night.

I ended up drinking tequila that her parents had in the fridge. My addict brain genuinely thought they wouldn't notice at the time. Obviously they fucking noticed. My girlfriend mostly doesn't drink but will occasionally drink tequila. She covered for me and said she was the one that drank it. But that was it. She broke up with me.

To be honest, I know she made the right decision. And that's what hurts the most. She's just another person that left and that I deserved to have leave.

When she broke up with me I relapsed even harder with both kratom and alcohol for about a week. But after a week of being nauseous literally all the time I just fed up and stopped both CT.

I've been going for 3-6 mile runs every night since then and just generally doing a lot of exercise. I'm clean and I'm going to stay that way. But the middle of the day while I'm alone with my thoughts still feels really dangerous. I can't even bring myself to reach out to my friends because I just feel like everyone is going to leave eventually when they realize who I am.

So I'm clean, but it's too late to save my relationship with the person I love. I miss her so much it hurts. She's reached out occasionally since then because she's like to stay friends but that's starting to hurt more than not hearing from her at all. And I know I did this to myself.",9,1

Got my energy back, I can finally study, laugh, cry and my remaining symptoms is some RLS and anxiety. I was using for almost 3 years and I‚Äôm so happy to have made it almost 3 weeks. The reason I quit is because a month ago, roughly an hour after dosing I noticed I had difficulty swallowing. Every time I would take a bite of my food it would feel like my throat didn‚Äôt want to swallow it or it felt like my food would get stuck. It wasn‚Äôt a fun feeling and that same night I had a panic attack. I never had trouble swallowing liquids but for some reason food for me was a challenge. Anyways, I‚Äôm 19 days CT and it has almost subsided and it happens on very rare occasions. It mainly happens when I‚Äôm eating and I‚Äôm thinking about that horrible feeling so I have to eat in smaller bites and take my time. I downed a fat burger two days ago and I was so fucking happy. No food got stuck or anything like that but thinking about that shitty feeling when I‚Äôm eating makes it hard for me to eat my meal in peace. I have to eat alone sometimes so I can be clear headed when I eat but that is also getting better since I downed that fat burger at a pub with my brother and his friend.

Any advice?,"I have been taking an 11% extract for about 2 years, by my calculations equal to about 70 gpd of leaf (though its hard to know for sure since it varies so much). Prior to the extract I took about 50gpd of leaf for roughly 4 years. I tapered from the extract pretty quickly over the course of 2 weeks and now for a week and a half I've been taking ~25 gpd of leaf spread out into 5 doses a day.

I'm pretty much not sleeping more than 2-3 hours a night for over a week now and feel like I'm in constant low grade withdrawal. I'm wondering if this really will settle out so I can drop down again. I thought by now I would have adjusted to the new dosage but now I just feel miserable all the time. I'm taking supplements (ashwanga, l-theanine, probiotics, and valerian and melatonin for sleep) and gabapentin, though I was already on gabapentin for a couple of years so I'm thinking it's less helpful than it would be if I were naive to it. I'm working out and meditating and trying to do all of the helpful things I've found listed here, but it's a nonstop struggle. 

I don't know if I can manage to arrange a couple of days to just go CT (single mom with a job that can't really do without me, or at least I'd need a damn good reason to miss work at the moment) but I thought the whole reason to taper was to avoid feeling this way as much. Could it be the length of time I took it? I realize I probably dropped down a little fast with the extract but I didn't want to fork over that kind of money knowing I want to quit and I just can't physically stomach swallowing enough of this garbage to get me out of my current withdrawal state. I thought if I embraced the suck for a week I'd reach a kind of stasis and could proceed from there. Instead I'm really struggling. I guess I would like to know if anyone successfully tapered without feeling this way or if I need to just be patient because it can take much longer to reach equilibrium between drops. At this point I'm considering finding some way to go CT without losing my job or letting my kids know something is up. Ideas? Thoughts? General encouragement? I'll take whatever you got.",1,0

Warning - never get complacent. I was doing so well at 60 days clean. No physicals, no PAWS, no cravings. I had beaten it. But I was hungover one day and thought one dose would help me. Trust me it gets so much worse if you keep using 

Question - you think I‚Äôll get physical withdrawals? I‚Äôm expecting some as I start to notice the feeling if I can make it to noon or 2pm without dosing. But I was completely clean for two months and I only used for three weeks 30+ gpd. What you think I‚Äôm in for?

So, long story short, I‚Äôve been abusing kratom off and on for a real years.  I‚Äôd I had to guess it‚Äôs been 3-4 years. That‚Äôs depressing to say the least.  Those years have been full of on again, off again, addiction.  Generally, I will dose heavily daily for several months‚Ä¶ quit‚Ä¶ and then go right back to it.  My quits last anywhere from a few days to a couple of months.  I‚Äôd say the norm is about a month.  You can take a look at my post history and just see how long and what I‚Äôve faced.  Still can‚Äôt believe I put myself through all of that and am still doing it.  

This latest stint has been a bit different.  I can‚Äôt remember the last time I had a full out long quit.  Sometime in 2020, I did quit for close to a month.  Then, about 3-4 months ago, I did make it about 3 weeks.  But the rest has been marked by 1 single big daily dose for months on end.  One thing is different‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been trying to quit since December.

In early 2021, I tried to quit a few times without success.  I would maybe make it a day or 2 before I relapsed.  Then, during early summer, I told myself I was going to do it.  I set myself up to succeed.  I would prepare my apartment‚Ä¶ clean everything, go to the grocery store, etc.  Then when I got home from work on Friday‚Ä¶ the withdrawals would kick in.  

I discovered something that made withdrawals wayyyyyyy more manageable than before‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs marijuana.  Before, I would be in agony for weeks on end.  I would just feel so uncomfortable.  Slight pain.  Achey.  Everything is boring.  Even TV is dull.  Sleep is impossible, even in the early stages of withdrawal.  Anxiety is high and you just want to redose.

Well, I found‚Ä¶ for me, that marijuana does the trick.  However, for me, it has to be in high doses.  I‚Äôve mostly been smoking concentrates (dabs) and taking edibles.  I will puff on dabs all night and eat edibles in the evening.  I will take roughly 100-300mg depending.  However, with edibles, I‚Äôm going to be a zombie for 24 hours.  

If all I had to do was smoke weed and chill, I‚Äôd have this beat in no time.  Easy.  The problem is work.  My work is not physical, but mentally demanding which is a nightmare for withdrawals. 

I‚Äôve now caught myself in this loop.  For the past several months, I‚Äôve been quitting on Thursday (withdrawals on Friday) and then redosing on Monday after work.  Basically, work sucks so much and is so painful that I have to redose just to make it through the rest of the week.  For months now‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been living this way.  Dosing through the week and then withdrawing on the weekend.  This can‚Äôt be good for my body.

I‚Äôve noticed all kinds of differences between when I take it and don‚Äôt.  When I‚Äôm clean, my metabolism goes way up, my skin dries out (not oily), my hair looks way more healthy, my lips softer, my eyes more lively, peeing easier, etc.  the list goes on and on.

I was able to secure some time off next week.  I have to go to work tomorrow, but I may call out for Wednesday.  I can probably withstand another day, but will need a break.  

I am a step ahead.  Usually, I redose.  The fact that I haven‚Äôt and I‚Äôm here posting‚Ä¶ I am farther ahead than I have been in a long time.",3,0

I'm just coming here to gain some input on what methods are most successful in quitting kratom.

I would say I'm a moderately high user, but not crazy high.

What is the withdrawal timeline?  Am I better going cold turkey or tapering off?  What supplements can I take to ease my recovery?

Tomorrow I have an interview for a job I'm very excited about but it's right around the corner from my old K store. My mind keeps making up ways I could easily go pick some up and start using again without anyone knowing. 
But for whatttttttttt????  I fucking hate being an addict. When I look at my sober face in the mirror now, it's almost like looking at someone I don't know. My skin looks alive, my eyes aren't sunken into my face, I don't look and feel sick. So why the fuck is my brain trying to trick me? Im on day 17, and I'm no stranger to getting sober from substances. But this has to be the hardest one mentally for me. Illegal substances are almost easier for me to stay away from because I cannot afford to get into any more legal trouble. But with kratom being sold at a damn store the devil in my ear is so damn loud.
Thank you for listing to me bitch lol. I'm grateful for all of you. One minute at a time I guess, right? If anyone has any relapse prevention tips I would love to hear them!",4,0

It both felt like forever and like no time at all. Sharing my experience here in case it helps anyone make the decision to quit. My WD experience was not nearly as bad as I'd scared myself into thinking it would be (I was terrified). I'm recapping all the details, but honestly, I would do it again in a heartbeat. I'm now grossed out at the thought of downing another hot cup of muck. Obviously, everyone's experience will vary, but maybe this will help someone to know that it can be better than you think. My usage over almost 3 years varied, but for the last 1.5, I'd say an average of 12-18 gpd, sometimes more, sometimes less.

Day 1: Definite jitters, cravings, runny nose, RLS, lethargy especially, after work, pretty much useless, the only night I had trouble falling asleep, had poor sleep (but not awful, just came in blocks). Took Benadryl (don't do that), CBD, and my anxiety meds (not benzos, taken nightly every night before and during my quit).

Day 2: Still had regular cravings, runny nose, lethargy, but the acute RLS subsided into some mild restlessness in my legs while trying to fall asleep--not nearly as tingly/needing to tense my muscles, just more the sensation of wanting to stretch. Took 1mg melatonin, 700 mg agmatine, a magnesium supplement, and CBD. Fell asleep okay. 

Day 3: This day was pretty much a blur. I was exhausted after work, but I powered through it to do sooooo many chores just to try to exhaust myself. Took the same combo as day 2. Got about six hours of sleep.

Day 4: Burning stomach started--this is when I really started to realize how damaging kratom was to my digestion and overall health. Very tired, but starting to feel more rested on less sleep. On kratom, I needed a solid nine hours of sleep. By this day, it was easier to get up in the mornings, even with less sleep. Took the same combo as days 2 and 3, minus the CBD. Slept fine, but did wake up for about an hour in the middle of the night. 

Day 5: Definitely the worst day. Burning stomach continued, nothing really did the trick. Runny nose, sneezing. Just chilled and binge-watched TV. Magnesium, melatonin, agmatine. Still got about six hours of sleep, but was wide awake in the middle of the night for about an hour and a half. Listened to some podcasts! 

Day 6: By far my best day yet. Slept for a solid, uninterrupted six hours, plus an extra hour after that. I really thought people were lying about how much more clarity you have after quitting. It's almost like everything seems crisper and brighter, like I'm taking in everything around me more. Nearly all physical symptoms have subsided aside from some general tiredness, lack of focus, runny nose, and sneezing. Had some amazing sex, had a good cry, lots of feelings overall. Only took magnesium at bedtime. Got almost eight hours of sleep. I woke up several times throughout the night, but was able to fall back asleep right away.

Day 7: Not as good as day 6, but better than 1-5. Burning stomach has subsided! Reminding myself to be kind to myself.  Planning on magnesium and CBD tonight, as I don't think I need the agmatine anymore (definitely helped with RLS) and it seems I got the best sleep with that combo. Thank you so much to the poster who recommended it on my first post here!

I can't believe I've had my kratom just sitting in a taped up box in a corner. I kept it on my kitchen counter for the first 2-3 days, then moved it to another room and literally forgot about it until just now. I used to use the same mason jar to drink my kratom every day, and now I use it at night to take my meds and supplements, reversing its symbolism to me. What can I say, I like a symbol. I still have regular cravings, but they're lessening in degree. At first, it felt like I just needed a dose to get through whatever next thing came my way. Within a week, I'm much better at recognizing the craving and letting it pass, reminding myself that I'm doing something good for my body and my health, and that kratom is not the solution to whatever discomfort I'm facing. Yes, kratom made me more social and joyful, but now I know that those qualities exist in me; I don't need kratom to nurture them.

I'm so appreciative of everyone in this group. Your stories and support make this so much easier, and I can only hope to be as helpful and supportive to those of you thinking about quitting. I'm looking forward to a kratom-free, beautiful ""OctSober.""

Much love to you all.",20,0

That lasted about a month or so. Than i wanted to take some to relax on a friday night and you guys know how that goes, was back to daily use again within a week. My use was minimal at that time, maybe 5-6 gpd. Than i discovered the extract shots and got out of control with them and was taking 3 a day. Decided i was done wasting all my money and feeling horrible and wanted to feel normal again, so i tapered off them and had minimal withdrawal symptoms. I stayed clean for about 2 months that time than lied to myself again thinking i could do it once. And was just on the powder this time, and tapered down once again. That time only lasted a week, and i was feeling great but had a bad day at work. Which led to my most recent run, that has been about 5 months. I was at 15-20 gpd and mixing extracts in every few days. I‚Äôve been attempting to taper down for about a month and a half. Which i have been somewhat successful with as im down to 2 4g doses a day, with an extract every few days. I finally realized i don‚Äôt have enough discipline to completely taper down and just jump off. So i have about 10gs left and am going to start at 4g than go down 1g a day and jump off.

I have been taking kratom everyday for close to a year now. The reason I started, was due to my lower back pain, as well as giving me a bit more energy. I have very physical jobs 7 days a week. The kratom really seemed to help me push through, give me the energy I needed, as well as taking the back pain away. Now I am starting to wonder, will it have to be this way forever?

 At one point I started taking close to 10 grams a day, but I controlled myself after a month. I now take about 1-2 grams 3x a day. With it being a smaller amount, at first I thought maybe I wouldn't get much harsh side effects, as well as it being a small amount, I thought, as long as I can keep a low dose and it is helping me in my everyday life, it should be fine? I'm questioning now if that's the addiction talking?

Some mornings I wake up feeling very fatigued, my back will seem to hurt alittle worse, and I feel alittle foggy in the head. I've always felt with depression, and the kratom almost seems to help that. But the past 2 months I've been having more depressed weekly episodes than I did before I started Kratom.

I guess what I'm trying to find out here.. Does anybody feel the same? Especially with taking only 5 grams a day? I see alot of post about 30-50 grams a day, and worse side effects than I am feeling. It almost feels hard to tell that these are kratom side effects, but I must be stuck in a foggy every kratom cycle... 

I would love to hear if anyone has any experience with daily low doses, as well if anybody took kratom for pain or energy even at higher doses, if they felt better after they quit taking it.

Kratom and Methylphenidate (prescribed) are the last two things I still didn't wanna let go of. 

I got the Dysacusis in December last year, it was scary but I got used to it. I basically hear sine wave noises, all kinds low to high frequency when I heard certain noises or notes in music. I didn't think it could be the Kratom at that time. But about 3 or 4 days ago it got worse and after reading that opioid use is connected to causing hearing loss and other hearing problems I just don't wanna risk it anymore and wanna quit. When calling with my GF today I broke down crying for the first time because I was so scared this would continue getting worse, luckly she is very supportive.

I was okay with the Dysacusis staying at the first level it was and I hope the recent worsening might go away with quitting. In the last month I also sometimes noticed that my normal tinnitus I had forever got a bit stronger on Kratom, but sometimes not so I didn't really think it would be the cause of it. Well I hoped, Kratom isn't my favourite drug, but it's one of the last things I just didn't wanna let go of.

Long time lurker.  I started using kratom off and on in 2019.  It started with the Viva Zen shots at the gas station.  I‚Äôm not a drinker and I‚Äôm in the military so I can‚Äôt use cannabis or anything like that.  Kratom took the edge off and I fell in love with it.

Around 2020 I was using it everyday.  Then it became a before work/after work thing.  I eventually found myself spending $3-500/mo on these stupid shots.

So I switched it up to powder.  It reeked absolute havoc on my gastro-intestinal system.  I didn‚Äôt shit normally for months.  It was rough. 

Id picked a few different dates to quit but before I knew it I‚Äôd always be running out to the store.  That‚Äôs when I really knew I had a problem.

This month my unit went out to the Joint Rotational Training Center at Fort Polk, Louisiana (arguably the worst place in the USA).  It‚Äôs a month long field exercise.  I knew I‚Äôd have no access to kratom so long as I didn‚Äôt pack any.

I didn‚Äôt pack any and forced myself to go through withdrawals.  Got back home after two weeks in the field and I believe most of the physical symptoms have subsided aside from the occasional RLS type uneasiness in my legs.  Nothing like what the first 4 days were like.

I‚Äôm done for real this time.  I think just making a post like this here is important because none of my family and friends have any clue what I‚Äôm dealing with.  I feel that putting it out there in a statement like this, even to strangers, will motivate me to stick with it!

Thank you guys for being here and good luck to everyone!!",27,0

I am.here to write an unbiased experience.with Kratom

Started almost 1.5.months ago ( maybe less) for recreational use.

Was taking around 20 gpd. Until one day took too much that I vomitted so I was like "" oh shit maybe cut.this shit off"".

I had heard about the awful side.effects this brings but did not know what was.to come.

Few hours after stopping, I had trouble breathing including pain under my chest.and especially in my back. My heart.was.thumping real hard also.

Panicked went to the hospital they couldn't find anything ( I didn't tell them I was taking kratom because my brother was with me.all the time and besides.ehere.i am from they have no idea.what this is)

Before 7-9 hours of CT had high fever like 38.8-39.2c and was like this throughout 1.5 days.

Now day 2.5 it's been 12 hours without fever and feel much better. Lots of sweating, restlessness,.feeling of being tired, headaches.and pain in the back of my eyes.

I won't lie I thought I might die. 

Please do not judge my use.

When you introduce kratom into your body it reacts with the body‚Äôs natural opioid receptors in the brain. .. the ones in kratom are mitragynine and 7-Œ±-hydroxymitragynine. 
We all know what it feels like to be on kratom so we know the feelings it brings, so we take more, the brain tries to balance this out more or less saying (hey dude..now I‚Äôm gonna have to create more receptors for your increased dosage just to keep you from overloading us) so the brain produces more receptors, to even it out, the more you take the more your brain is trying to keep a balance, so when you quit taking it..there‚Äôs tons of opioid receptors saying hey, where‚Äôs our stuff, each hr that goes by the screaming in your body grows louder, until one by one the brain starts destroying the receptors that aren‚Äôt being used, hence why it gets easier over time and it‚Äôs worth it..oh and I owe a huge apology to my brain for what I put it through lol",54,0

I had been taking Kratom twice daily for about three years and I recently started to notice ways in which my life was drastically different. For a long time I played it off as the fault of the pandemic but deep down I knew I was lying to myself. I became withdrawn from my friends, not dating anyone (probably due to not feeling worthy), aging quicker than normal, irritable, no creativity, hard to focus, bad memory and lack of feelings. It dawned on me I hadn't cried in years! That's so sad to me. I have straight up not been living, completely checked out of life. I kept hearing myself say ""I just want my old life back"". I told two different people about my situation and it was completely dismissed as not being a big deal because they don't understand. It's legal, it must be ok, right? That's where this page came along and helped me SO much. Hearing other people's stories was extremely helpful because it validated my fears, which I had been ignoring. 

So... moving forward. I took my last Kratom Thursday, 9/23/21 at 3:00pm. For the past two days I have allowed the pain to flow in. And it's definitely flowing. I cry, I don't sleep, I went to some dark places. BUT, now on day three I can already feel the veil begin to lift. It's not unicorns and rainbows and I know this is going to take some time before I'm 100% but for starters, I went running this morning and felt so alive. I can't tell you how amazing it feels to be myself again. I no longer wonder if my feelings are because of the Kratom. I OWN EVERYTHING. IT IS ALL ME.

I didn't make the leap because I wasn't okay with quitting. I probably thought that in the front of my mind that I was okay with it. But I've been stalling and I've stalled during every quit obviously.

Well now my has family caught me. I can't hide it anymore. After breaking my families heart and being shipped to rehab I just came home and messed up again. Thank the good Lord I haven't reached for any of the other substances. YET.

I was caught because kratom always messes with my appearance and under my eyes especially. No matter what when I use kratom I have dark circles. And whenever I quit, POOF! They go away. I just begin to look kind of sick from the K. I know that doesn't happen to everyone, but it happens to me every single time, so it's probably not the best thing for me to be ingesting on a daily basis.

I'm on day 1 again. At least I'm okay with it this time. I have to quit for me now, but I also can't do this to my family again. I know it will be hard and PAWS will really suck, but I have to put my sobriety first. I may miss work and lose money, but at least I'll be saving what I spent on extract shots. I can't relapse every time I have a shitty day anymore. I'm at the period of my life in my mid 20's where it's now or never basically.

Knowing this too shall pass, and that EVENTUALLY I will feel much better without this stuff gives me a spark of peace and motivation at the same time. Going forward I am putting my sobriety and self care first. Over my job and everything because if this keeps going on I will be at a point in my life where I realized that I really messed things up and am not proud of the person I've become. I don't want that. The future me is who I am RIGHT NOW. I'm actually okay with giving it up for good now because I can't ruin my life anymore. I want to thank myself at 35 and not hate myself. This is just the bridge between me and my better life. If you're not going over the bridge you're not on your way to where you want to be which is happy and off kratom, you might not ever make any progress. If you're still using, put some plan into action and be honest with your self, so you don't end up being angry at your self later.

This is day one to ‚ôæÔ∏è for me. Good luck kicking the sludge everyone! Being okay with quitting is all it takes because we're all capable of making it through this pain so I'm glad to be started. Just not happy about the withdrawals, but I'll live through it and be glad that I pushed open the narrow door to a better life.",34,0

Im 25 years clean from heroin and unbelievably that seemed easier.  I worked 20 yrs as a psychotherapist so intellectually I know the models of the disease/recovery process; but it is feels useless in the face of my  kratom addiction. 

So with each relapse progression happens and now I am on extracts which seems to take a heavier toll on my body.   Heres the thing, I am 66 years old and when I go ct it gets scary (heart races, panic symptoms that make me feel I'd rather die than stay inside my own skin etc)  On the other hand the extract addiction, not w/d, has me having night sweats and needing some plain leaf to go back to sleep.   I'm terrified of going inpatient, because I think the recovery community has little understanding  of  kratom  and how to treat its dependence.    Wondering if anyone can relate to these issues or had any experience?   I know that only alcohol and benzo dependence require medical supervision due to seizure potential, but again what do we really know about kratom??   And do we really know what goes into extracts?   I know I don't!

I re-read this and apologize for rambling but its indicative of my head right now.   Does anyone feel like  their brain is wrapped in dirty cotton?  Its been 5 years of use and I seem to remember thinking more clearly and in general being more curious and optimistic.

One of the reasons I got into kratom in the first place is that it allowed me to have an enjoyable guilt free few hours to myself.  For instance, I would take it on a Friday night, after the family had gone to bed, and that would lead to several hours of very focused and enjoyable hobby time/computer game time/reading, etc.  Knowing that it would keep me up for like 6 hours would allow me to not feel guilty about taking time for myself (can‚Äôt sleep anyway) and I would usually have a great time and then wake up more refreshed after 4 hours of sleep than I would any night I didn‚Äôt do that.  That would generally lead to a very enjoyable family weekend, chores and gardening done, workouts, etc.  

Eventually, it turned into a daily thing and that cheapened it, turning more into a chronic lack of sleep and rarely gave me the aforementioned experience.  

I‚Äôve been off the stuff for almost a month (29 days?) and while life has been slowly returning to normal I just can‚Äôt seem to motivate myself to do something for me.

I finally realized I want to live a completely sober life and not be dependent on any substance.

About a month ago I started an aggressive taper where I started out cutting my dose by over half, to about half a tablespoon of powder every 4hrs. Last week was 1 teaspoon every 4hrs and on Wednesday I was doing half a teaspoon every 4hrs until I decided to just go off completely and took my last dose of half a teaspoon Thursday night at 11pm. It's been 40hrs since then. 

For anyone who's been down this road, when did your body stop hurting? I'm getting through it, and determined to quit, but the uncertainty of when I'll finally feel okay again is so mentally taxing.

So about day 15-17 was pretty terrible.. it seemed like everything was great before that, then I was hit with this wave of withdrawal symptoms again. RLS. Full body RLS. Insomnia. Sweating. Chills. Achy. Tired. 

This lingered for about 2-3 days.. which, during really sucked, I wasn't sleeping more than 3 hours each night.. But now I'm here on day 19. I slept 7 hours last night which was AMAZING. I've been having really weird intense dreams since quitting. When I was using, I pretty much just dreamed in blackness. No dreams what so ever. Now it's like WOAH. I wish I knew how to interpret dreams because, god damn. Some of them have been really depressing, others wildly imaginative and fun, and even one where I wasn't even in the dream. At all. That was a first. I've always been in my own dreams, as me. Never as someone else. (if you want details to that dream, let me know lmao. Swear I will never forget it, but it's long and depressing). 

Anyways, over all I'm feeling about 85% of the way there. Today, I just have sweaty pits still. Not nearly as bad as they once we're.. that's been my main complaint over the last week, it's just endless sweating! Granted, I'm in California and it's been pretty fucking hot but.. got DAMN. The Kratom sweats are outrageous, and the smell... üòê Ugh. But otherwise, really no other symptoms. It's only 10am here so we'll see how the day goes but, I feel pretty good right now. 

Hope ya'll are staying strong and keeping sober. Tapering like a badass or starting out your first few days. Everything gets better, but we all need to be patient. Don't forget that.

It wasn't really meant for others but after putting it together I think alot of you could relate to many of the bullets. 

There's pretty much no structure or order, it's just everything I could think of that makes me really hate this drug and why it's ruining my life. 

I used to use daily and quit for 3 months but relapsed on a Sunday just for ""one comfy dose just for today"" which made me get some the next 3 Sundays which led to Saturday night which led to Monday morning which led to Tuesday, etc, etc, you know the drill. I ended up 5 days a week for over a month and daily for 2 weeks before quitting again because I was going on vacation and didn't want to have to take this shit because I know I'd have an awful time if I did, luckily I was only using for 3 months and 4-5 days a week so withdrawals weren't too bad mostly small RLS, sweats, GI. 

I mostly wanted to put this together because right now I'm 2 weeks sober with 1 relapse 5 days ago and all I can think about is kratom. I am craving for hours everyday but reading these posts makes my sober brain convince me I really shouldn't because I really wanna quit. I love you guys and this subreddit. Always keep posting your updates and revisit every now and then after you've quit for good to let us know what's it's like on the other side! 

Well here's the list. I will probably keep updating it overtime as I think of new stuff. 

 ‚Ä¢ Taking one dose ""because it's been forever and I want one Friday night of turning my brain off and relaxing"" makes you want it Saturday night, all day Sunday, beginning of work Monday and all week and when coming home. Now kratom is an option and you think about it CONSTANTLY. 

 ‚Ä¢ It's not even that euphoric, it just dulls everything and gives you this hazy, foggy feeling like you're coasting through life without taking anything in 

 ‚Ä¢ You get constipated immediately and gotta take a shit 5 times a day only for nothing to come out but still feel like you have to go. Wiping so much it bleeds and hurts

 ‚Ä¢ Hair loss!!! You're already balding and trying to stop it so why keep taking something that's contributing to your balding? 

 ‚Ä¢ Lowered testosterone = make no progress at the gym!! Lowered sex drive. Seriously you almost never get stronger while taking kratom. 

 ‚Ä¢ You don't even care about the gym anymore. You have no motivation to push yourself and all the workouts feel so much more difficult because all you can think about is getting out of there and taking your dose when you get home. 

 ‚Ä¢ Super iritable after 30 minutes into the dose and you're just left with this hazy, fogginess and a craving to do more since now you only feel the dull and hazy but felt good for 30 minutes earlier in the day

 ‚Ä¢ You think about doing it as soon as you wake up

 ‚Ä¢ You think about going out and buying some when you start working

 ‚Ä¢ You think about going out and buying some during lunch

 ‚Ä¢ You want to skip the gym and buy some and just lay in bed instead

 ‚Ä¢ After the gym you want to go buy some 

 ‚Ä¢ Home from the gym and you want to go back out and buy some

 ‚Ä¢ You hate needing this substance to feel ""normal"" and envy sober people's emotions, happiness, simplicity and normality

 ‚Ä¢ You hate how this drug takes over your mind and controls your life. You're not in control on kratom and it's so annoying, difficult and scary. 

 ‚Ä¢ You can never truly relax without it. You remember years ago laying in bed after a long day with the same cuddley warm kratom provides because you were actually happy in life!! 

 ‚Ä¢ You haven't been truly happy in 4 years and it all started when you started doing drugs. 

 ‚Ä¢ You don't want to do anything and everything feels like a chore. You want to take a dose of kratom before doing ANYTHING to make it bearable. Cooking, taking the garbage out, doing laundry, God forbid you clean something sober. 

 ‚Ä¢ Your irritablness, lack of emotion and depression are reflected in your relationship and you get pissed off more, don't want to do anything, and always need to take kratom before doing anything or else you dread so much whatever fun activity you were going to do with the person you love.

 ‚Ä¢ The irratible and pissed off-ness (and being dependent on a substance) makes you hate yourself and remember back how forgiving and loving and lively you used to be. I don't know how your SO hasn't left you at times. 

 ‚Ä¢ The few times you quit doing drugs for a while you found so much more happiness in the little day to day things. A good cup of tea, looking forward to hanging out with friends, even food. You don't care about any of this stuff when using kratom.

 ‚Ä¢ The stability of being sober is unmatched. On kratom your mood fluctuates from feeling real good to wanting to kill yourself in an hour. It causes you so much anxiety that you need to take more kratom. 

 ‚Ä¢ After months of use you ALWAYS keep increasing the dose or frequency of dosing. And you ALWAYS realize you csnt keep doing this and need to quit AGAIN. 

 ‚Ä¢ You hate yourself for letting this happen AGAIN 

 ‚Ä¢ Never feeling excited about anything. Planned a week vacation to Orlando and didn't even care about going while your SO was so excited and happy (although thank God you quit a week before your trip). I envy her excitement and general happiness so much. I can't even picture myself being like that. 

 ‚Ä¢ Needing to take kratom with you everywhere you go and redosing constantly like I'm going to go through hell without it

 ‚Ä¢ Kratom becomes your only source of feeling good. You have no fulfillment, no long term rewarding feeling, no well being or purpose in life. You honestly don't even care that much if you suddenly died.

 ‚Ä¢ You feel so trapped and alone and scared to go in deeper knowing the longer you keep taking the worse its going to be to quit.

 ‚Ä¢ You lost all interest in your hobbies and doing anything in general. Now you just get home and try to lay in bed and watch TV as soon as your can until you go to bed, feeling like a waste of life and hopeless just wanting that kratom to make you feel nothing and content.

 ‚Ä¢ Your life will be so much more fulfilling and rewarding if you stopped relying on drugs to get through various life activities.

 ‚Ä¢ You used to actually enjoy your job and look forward to it. And that's still there!! The few times you were able to quit you actually got into your work and your coworkers don't piss you off any more. 

 ‚Ä¢ You used to fear for your future, not knowing what you'd become so you pretended you didn't care until you couldn't pretend anymore. You knew you couldn't keep using kratom forever. Your kratom use had an end date and the further out it was, the further down the rabbit hole you would've gotten and the more pain and hell you would've experienced.

 ‚Ä¢ You only ever feel truly excited when you think about your next dose after a few sober hours. Normal fun activities like socialing, going out, going on vacation feel like nothing to you and you couldn't care less because you just want to lay in bed and watch TV numbed on kratom.",50,0

I'm so thankful to be able to start living a life again. Will stay vigilant against relapse. I did toss and wash with disgusting powder in high doses for a long time so it is so disgusting to me and I used to always throw up trying to get my doses down in the mornings even with some food in stomach.

Might make further posts if I deal with any significant PAWS or anything like that. Best of luck to everyone. Remember: withdrawals are about getting the attitude towards going through the pain you need to get through and keep yourself from relapsing, as well as connection to others. It is bad physically, but it is mostly mental. Rigorous exercising makes these withdrawals much easier and listening to music helps to lubricate those numbed emotions and use them to give you conviction to confront this. 

Will report back whatever happens, and as long as I stay clean I might post my milestones on occasion. Fare well and take care of yourselfüíå",20,0

My body and mind and subconscious self told me it was time to quit the 100+ gram-per-day habit I'd developed after I quit drinking.   


""It's just like quitting coffee,"" is what my not-so-intensive internet research told me.   


Twelve hours later I was sitting on the couch, freezing cold, feeling like I had the flu, wondering what this fresh hell was all about. Then I found this group--and it was an absolute G\*d send for me, a freaking gift from heaven, maybe even manna.   


I read as much as I could, usually at 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the morning, when I was wide awake. I took the advice and tried to understand what was happening to my mind and body. I tried to share some encouraging words with others when I could. I felt like shit and spent the first week whimpering and shuffling around as if I'd suffered (another) brain injury.   


And then things got better. Each morning, my body shook just a little bit less. Each workout (and I always forced myself to workout) got a little longer, a little more intense. I ate a little more, bitched a little less. I felt music again. Sleep started to happen and sundowns didn't seem so much like scary shadows in the bushes anymore. I got nine hours of OK sleep last night. Nine freaking hours. Can you imagine?   


I hope so; I hope you can see yourself sleeping again. And smiling and laughing and enjoying the company of people you love again. Because, friends, it's going to happen. It's happening for me--and I'm loving it.

It even persists now even though I'm on day 10 with zero kratom. The fact that this morning withdrawal has persisted after tapering to almost nothing and even after quiting is driving me kind of insane.

It's one of the biggest reasons why I wanted to taper and quit. I just couldn't get enough sleep without waking up early to the withdrawal. I never got withdrawal between doses in the past 8 months, but only after sleeping. If I took a tiny amount only to ward off the achiness after waking, then I'd be fine all day. Something about sleeping resets my system.

Now I can never get fully rested. I woke up to it today, took supplements like Black Seed oil, got hydrated and then it mostly went away after thirty minutes. I laid back in bed for about 3 hours, in and out of sleep which reactivated the unpleasant symptoms. Now thus drained feeling, restlessness and lack of focus is still persisting a couple hours after me second sleep/nap. Despite lying in bed for almost 11 hours total, I still feel like I haven't been entirely rejuvenated.

I'm just wondering how long this will take to go away over time and if anyone else experiences it. I'm staying strong and soldiering through it no matter what, but I could really use some relief to get back on track soon.

Sorry if my writing seems kinda scatterbrained and incoherent. I haven't felt fully like myself lately, especially after not ever getting fully rested in the last 2 and a half months. Mono in combination with this back in June oddly also made my insomnia worse and it's stayed poorer than usual even after the illness passed.",4,0

Ive quit kratom many times, but as many times as I've said never again, I've always somehow seemed to come back to it. I went to rehab and have been able to quit multiple terrible habits and vices. Kratom is just the one thing that I can't seem to let go of 100% and it won't let go of me.  There have been many instances where I've thought to myself that I'm never going to do it again and that I feel much better without it.
I quit recently for 3 months, another quit for 2 weeks, and another quit for 1 week. It's not the craving for kratom that brings me back, but the nothingness that I feel. I do okay and can function after the acute withdrawals. But anhedonia is destroying my life. I can't enjoy the simple pleasures of life. I can't engage in a conversation or even watch YouTube videos on my own. I definitely can't do the things that I love. AND I WANT TO DO THOSE THINGS. My brain just stops me. It's a terrible feeling or lack there of. I don't mind feeling depressed, but I would love to at least be able to watch movies or play video games in sadness than to feel nothing at all.
Once I take kratom I can enjoy video games, tolerate people, watch a video, or get in my car and go somewhere. I hate it. It's not like kratom is a cure all though because it blunts my emotion and music doesn't hit the same. Does anybody out there have any advice on how to improve this?

I'm officially at the end of day 17! 
(I tapered from 30gpd to 12gpd in a 3 month time span, got stuck and then CT'd. 2 year long user.)

Some things I've noticed..
It seemed like after day 11, EVERYTHING was great. I was happy, I slept really good for two nights in a row (like, 9 hours EACH). My RLS was gone. I was still sweaty/stinky/getting the chills but pretty much 80% normal.. since about day 14/15, I started getting the insomnia again.. and the full body RLS. The sweating and having to sleep under only a sheet. Really intense vivid dreams.. It was about 2-3 random days of this. 

Last night I managed to actually sleep about 5 hours instead of 2-3 which is great, but I need like, at least 7 to function lol. I've been very sluggish last couple of days and I noticed this body soreness randomly come on midway through the day. 

I think what I experienced before was what they call the ""pink cloud"", where you think it's finally over, but it isn't. Now I'm being hit in waves... Such fun. Ugh. 

Not trying to be a downer, but I don't wanna sugar coat things and make them seem better than they are. I'm having some strong depressional episodes come on randomly, and anxiety in the morning. I've had depression since I was a kid, and my anxiety/panic really only started when I started using kratom. So I take that as a by product of the withdrawals. I hope it doesn't linger long.. I'd much rather deal with the depression than the anxiety/panic attacks to be honest.

Anyway, I say all this with a grain of salt. I honestly feel sooooo much better than I did those first 6 days. I am so grateful for that. I just wish I'd stop feeling crummy, but I guess kratom is just another drug that I underestimated.. I can't wait to feel 100%. I know it'll take time, and that's ok but, I'm being impatient lmao. 


Hope you all are getting there/feeling good/getting sober/living sober. It's been totally worth it, even through all the whining i do, I wouldn't change a thing.b

In 2020 I thought i had left kratom behind me. So far my longest quit was 4 months, then a day relapse and two more clean months. But i gave all that up last October. And I knew the day I relapsed I was gonna be back on it for a while. I broke my wrist this winter, was off work two months, and quit again at the end of that, only to relapse when I got back to work. Quit a couple more times this summer, and did well away from it in a two week vacation, only again to relapse at the thought of back to work. That was early Aug. A couple times since then I've run out, or thrown the last quarter/third of my stash out, only to tire of WDs after a day or two and buy again. (No store in town, but i order from a site and ship by fedex so it's a couple days) And I have a life coach, she knows I've had this problem but has no idea that it's still even a thing. I've never found her very helpful on the drug use topic, she wants to know why and then just uses that as a springboard back to the topic of embracing emotions, relationship ith myself, defining myself internally, etc. My work covers some counselling so I may try that. I don't have very bad wDS even, diarrhea and sneezing, unpleasant but nothing too crazy. I knowI need to stop to move forward with mmyself but i don't seem to have the will to tough it out anymore. COVID blahs, life hassles, comfort zone of using intoxicants, not sure what it is. (When i do try to quit I just end up using more weed or beer anyway so it doesn't really pay off.) I'm just venting I guess but any thoughts? And if any of you are clean and taking it for granted like I did, learn from my mistakes!",5,1

Start my day with 500mg of vitamin C, eat breakfast, take pre workout, go to the gym and I‚Äôm not lethargic for the rest of the day. Emotions are coming back, drinking loads of water and the brain fog is slowly subsiding. Time flew it feels like I quit last week. Studying is still forced but I genuinely enjoy going to class learning and participating. No PAWS I know not everyone gets them but I‚Äôm in a good headspace right now. I‚Äôm finally starting to enjoy the activities more and more slowly. Only lingering symptoms are slight lethargy, some anxiety (comes in waves but it‚Äôs manageable), sneezing anf waves of brain fog if I don‚Äôt get my body and my brain moving. To everyone that‚Äôs struggling right now or scared to jump just stick to it. Everything will be OK. The thought of the WDs aren‚Äôt as bad as the actual WDs. If you can afford take maybe a week or two off of work then do it. Work out, watch TV, study, do whatever you can to keep your body and mind occupied. My lethargy started subsiding about 3 days ago when I decided to exercise and that helped my body create some natural energy. Keep going at it you got this! Fuck kratom! This community has been a big help and dont be discouraged by other people‚Äôs posts this is YOUR journey. I did this shit with vitamin C being my only helper med. it‚Äôs not hard but it‚Äôs also not easy. I‚Äôm not strong mentally by any means but yet I still did it. To you that‚Äôs reading this, this whole community believes in you. Relapsing will not fix you, it will make you feel guilty and like SHIT. You will have to go through all the pain all over again just don‚Äôt do it. Your brain is adjusting and trying to balance your chemicals again. It is learning to release happy chemicals without the need of the green sludge. The sooner you find things that you enjoy and release stress, anxiety etc, and the sooner you can force your body and your brain to work in a normal environment like work or the gym, the sooner you will start to feel like yourself again. I‚Äôm not 100% but I feel closer to 100% than I did on day 1. I feel like I‚Äôm 80% but that 100% is something that will come with time! Remember that your anxiety ir depression may not be due to withdrawals. Maybe that anxiety and depression is the reason you started kratom. You are here today because you came to the conclusion that it is taking over your life. Don‚Äôt look up every single symptom. You will turn into a hypochondriac lol. No permanent damage was done to you, your brain, your heart, your nervous system, your liver, kidneys, lungs, etc. Just drink a shit load of water, electrolytes, vitamins and EAT. FUEL YOUR BODY. I‚Äôm still struggling to eat but I can finally got more than 1 meal a day. For the first week I couldn‚Äôt even eat a whole protein bar because my anxiety was so bad. Good luck with your journey everyone and don‚Äôt be afraid to reach out to people that have made roughly the same progress as you or people that have more days CT under their belt. If you feel ‚Äúweird‚Äù or like shit it‚Äôs a good sign. It means your body is adjusting and calling you a fucking idiot for putting that BS in your system for so long!",11,0

How long can I expect to have to wait for my brain to recalibrate itself?","I used kratom every day or two for the last two months for reducing back pain due to scoliosis and decided to quit about four days ago due to experiencing way too many deal-breaking side-effects. My doses were quite small (5g-8g every day or two) compared to what most of you were taking, yet despite taking it for a rather short duration, and despite taking relatively small amounts, kratom has definitely had a major negative effect on my brain.

**Here are some of the side-effects I've been experiencing that seem quite common:**

I feel completely unlike myself / am experiencing brain fog / am stuck in autopilot (which, as a whole, could probably be classified as dissociation).

I have poor appetite and often forget to eat.

I'm experiencing wild mood swings and depression.

Many nights are sleepless and those rare times where I am able to sleep I don't sleep for anything more than three or four hours. Before starting kratom I would sleep for an average of 8.5 hours a night.

My sex drive, which is usually high, is basically non-existent.

My stools are definitely way harder than they otherwise would be and I experience way fewer bowel movements. I have a high-fiber diet and haven't experienced constipation in years, so the kratom is almost certainly responsible for this.

**Here are some of the side-effects I've been experiencing that I feel aren't common:**

Caffeine, which I'm usually highly sensitive to, has next to no effect on me. The other day as a test I took 400mg of caffeine tablets in one sitting and couldn't really feel a thing. This is despite having a rather low caffeine tolerance at the moment. I love caffeine and dislike not being able to feel its effects.

My hot / cold sensitivity is drastically diminished and my brain almost registers these sensations as pain.

When listening to music at my regular volume level it sounds very quiet, lacks detail and dimension and doesn't bring me much enjoyment. I've been avoiding listening to it as I feel compelled to crank the volume up which I don't want to do as I don't want to risk messing up my hearing.

‚Äî

**Three questions:**

**I.** Considering how long I've been taking kratom for and that my dosage amounts were rather low, how long can I expect to have to wait for my brain to recalibrate itself and be able to experience things in a normal manner again? I almost feel that I've perma-fried my brain but I trust that things will eventually go back to how I felt before starting kratom. However, from day-to-day I really don't sense any improvement which is a bit worrying. 

**II.** Does anyone know of any supplement I can take to help speed up the process of recalibrating my brain, or do I basically just have to wait this out? Would ashwagandha or CBD be of any help?

**III.** Are those last three side-effects common? Our of those three side-effects the most troubling by far would have to be music sounding quiet and being unenjoyable as music has long been my go-to means of reducing stress and lifting my mood. Lacking that pleasure really makes life feel empty. Music sounding much quieter than usual is actually one of the first things I noticed the first time I took kratom; the onset of that effect was basically immediate. Despite kratom being out of my system for a few days now there doesn't seem to be any notable change in my hearing volume, which is a bit concerning.",2,0

The physical wds arent nearly as bad but having much more cravings. My life is in much better shape than it was when I quit for the first time, but kratom def does make getting thru an 8 hour shift with a good attitude easier. 

I had to work yesterday and it wasnt too bad, im off today and have to go in tommorow. Hoping I have alittle more energy and wont be as cold as i am now.

I realize this has to be now or never. I have to restart my life with a clear mind kratom and alcohol free, otherwise i will just go to work go home get fucked up and watch stupid shit on the internet for the rest of my life.

I have been reading about modafinil and it seems like it would be good in the short term for PAWS. I found an online vendor and now have some. I have taken it (while still using kratom) and can see how the effects would eliminate most of the PAWS symptoms I experience.  I have energy and am in a great mood (but not the reckless sort from Adderall or similar).  Its been a great tool just in my tapering process (I am coming form a 100+ GPD habit and now down to about 30)  


I was wondering if anyone else has experience with using it for PAWS? any negatives or positives? So far the only negatives I have had is a lack of appetite and a bit of tightness in my chest (not pain)  


I really need to make it through PAWS this time. I managed to be 100% clean for almost 3 years. I got severely injured (required knee surgery) and had to go on roxi's , then Percocet. That's all it took, I was right back to full on using opiates again. I switched to kratom when the doc refused to write anymore pills for me.

2 nights ago, I needed 10mg of melatonin and Hyland's RLS medicine just to get 4 hours of sleep, waking up every hour or so. Last night though, I used nothing and slept straight through the night (11-5) til my alarm woke me up. All today, I had 0 mental or physical withdrawals...except for this light-headed feeling and ringing ears

The light headedness thing started 2 days ago and I thought nothing of it; if I'm crouching while at work to check my phone/talk to someone, after a few minutes, I stand up and would have that light headedness that many people get occasionally. As of 2 days ago though, it keeps happening. It seems like almost every time I sit or crouch for more than 2-3 minutes and stand up, I get that blindness thing for a few seconds.

Along with it, I've started getting a ringing in my ears for about a minute, followed by white noise for another minute or two before going away. The first time it happened I thought it was tinnitus because I work near loud machinery (I wear construction headphones all day) and it freaked me out. Is this something any of you have had happen before/how long did it last because it makes me nervous every time

A brief back story‚Ä¶.I quit drinking alcohol on Nov 25 2015. No drugs since March 7th 2016. I started taking Kratom (August 2016)for the energy and motivation that it gave me while working. I took it for roughly 3 years 30-40 gpd. I started taking the 4 letter extract shots in March of 2019. I have been using 7-10 of them a day since then.  I work seasonal work, so I work 6 months then off for 6 months. During those 6 months 3 of those months I worked 130-140 hours per week. So I would justify it saying I‚Äôm having to spend money to make money. 1 shot every 2-3 hours. I was always in a brain fog but I always had energy.It has cost me a around $600 to $800 a week. At least a case (45count)a week for the past 2 years. I know, a lot of wasted $$$. It‚Äôs makes me sick to think about how much I have blown on these little bastards. When I would get home from work I stay busy so I would justify taking them for the extra energy it gave me. This year when I got home August 2nd I decided enough was enough. I could have bought a 2 brand new vehicles cash for as much as I have wasted on them. I have been on this subreddit everyday since August 7th. Sometimes for hours just reading and researching everyone‚Äôs story.I got all the supplements that everyone on here said to get. I started running 6 days a week. I CT quit on August 14th and stayed quit until September 21st. 5 weeks 3 days total. It was total shit show for the first 4 days. But manageable. I never got the energy back. Totally lethargic. My kratom dependence has been a secret from my family. So I have been acting a certain way for years. Always happy and energetic. Now I have been different.Now my family thinks that I am battling depression which I guess I am but it is from coming off the kratom shots. And couldn‚Äôt dare tell them. I can handle the PAWS and lethargy but I feel like I have screwed something up in my brain. Similar to a bad alcohol hangover without the nausea or headaches if that makes any sense. It‚Äôs like I am in a constant state of brain scramble.Idk if you would call it brain fog or something else but I‚Äôm scared I have done permanent damage. Can someone/anyone tell me when this scrabble brain feeling goes away? I have read up to 6 months. I don‚Äôt go back to work until March 1st so I have time but I guess I just need some reassurance that I will go back to baseline. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Mild flu like symptoms started around the 24 hour mark (1200mg vit c knocked that out), appetite came back with a vengeance 48 hours in (working out is key!), and RLS came around the 72 hour mark but was gone the next day. 

Anxiety, irritable mood, sneezing, mild stomach pain, and brain fog/dp are the last symptoms sticking around.

I am constantly drinking coffee like i got this weird craving for it. For a while I couldn‚Äôt figure out what this was but i think its my brain trying to get me to relapse. Idk what to do. I honestly want to do kratom super bad. It made me feel so good. But also so awful and i fucking hate that shit. Ugh i wish i never tried it in the first place,4,0

Exercise/shower combo, cannabis (both CBD and THC, surprisingly THC seems to give me more physical relief during withdrawals than CBD)

Psychological:

Music (conviction, philosophy, spiritual fortitude)  [particularly for me Uprising, Exodus, Survival, Natty Dread, and Talkin Blues albums by Bob Marley and the Wailers ;D]

Exercise and the shower help so much. Exercise especially has got to be the foundation of my healing if I'm going to get through this. It was the foundation for my life itself before I reached this addiction. The scariest part for me is the night time, not being able to sleep and having to walk around in the dark or rain if I need to move (I live in a very, very, very small space). 

Today is my seventh day taking 9gpd after dropping straight down there from 50gpd for 18 months. I really want to not take my dose tonight and just do it. Every evening thus far, I have been feeling like a victim, beaten and begging for reprieve. My attack plan for this first night which will hopefully be cold turkey is exercise, running at night or doing push-ups, pull-ups, squats, whatever to exhaust my body, listening to music for emotional quickening for conviction when I feel at my lowest. 

I'm trying to cut back my nicotine use as much as possible because as soon as I puff nicotine during withdrawals I become much more explosively restless and miserable for the next 20-40 minutes. Also cut back on my cannabis use even tho it helps me because if I use it too much then I just feel hazy, obtuse, and far more prone to talking myself into taking the small relief dose. 

I'll walk all night if I have to. That's how I feel now just having run and listening to healing music and starting to confront my emotional repression. We will see if kratom actually took my balls from me or not.",4,0

Hello everyone,

I‚Äôve been a long time lurker and infrequent poster under my old username. Whenever kratom got the better of me, I‚Äôd turn to these forums and read quit stories for hope. Went CT last Monday, the 13th, at 5:30 a.m. Just wanted to add my own experience in the hope it gives you hope.

I‚Äôm 30, and a substance abuser for the last 15 years. I got my start with alcohol at 15, and was an active alcoholic, between the rehab/detox trip here and there, from 18 to 28 (quit 6/9/19). I first smoked marijuana at 18, and smoked daily from 20 until five weeks ago, starting again only during the last couple of days of my kratom quit (we‚Äôll talk about that soon). I have an addiction to pills too, specifically GABA-receptor medications and benzodiazepines, which got heavy since I quit drinking. I remember blacking out in the bathroom and waking up in my own piss three years ago.

And then, the final drug I picked up was kratom, in September 2018, if I remember correctly. At the time, I worked a physically intensive job, and the tree dirt ‚Äúhelped‚Äù me with the work. Then it ‚Äúhelped‚Äù me with my art and home pursuits and every other thing. Dangerously, it ‚Äúhelped‚Äù with traumatic memories and social challenges. I had to take it at first for the euphoria, then I started taking it to numb the pain I was feeling and suppressing.

I took it for three years, averaging 60+ GPD, with three total successful at-home detoxes (including this most recent one), and with two relapses; one in June 2020, when asking someone out on a date triggered bad vibes; and in March 2021, when I was faced with another difficult romantic social situation. Not to digress, but I‚Äôm certain now some of the pain I was suppressing with substances stems from sex abuse I suffered from a peer at the age of six. Plus, I recently found out I‚Äôm on the autism spectrum. 

Early August 2021, I had another social falling out, this time over my kratom use. I went deep into the dirt, the pills, the weed, got strung out, and became fixated on suicide, which is a huuuuuuge warning sign, considering I‚Äôve been ‚Äúpink-slipped‚Äù twice in my life (spent time in inpatient detox). Thankfully, I had people in my corner who didn‚Äôt back down on me, and they encouraged me to get help. Our local ER didn‚Äôt do much, but I found a free intensive outpatient treatment program through my local state-funded treatment center. Even better, it‚Äôs down the road and around the corner from where I live. 

My program consisted of a group meet and an individual session once a week, with more groups an option M, Tues, Wed, and Thurs, beginning around the last week of last month. I was off marijuana, but still taking Kratom. 

I had 25 days off the smoke when a friend close in age died of a heart attack. I realized death wasn‚Äôt what I wanted, and death was what kratom pushed me towards. I had to be done with the dirt for good, and had to detox one last time.

So, eight days ago, I leapt off a 60-90 GPD habit. This quit was by far the worse, like how the second quit was worse than the first ‚Ä¶ does that make sense? What I experienced in the past week has convinced me that this is it, I cannot go through the pain again, not if I want to live a healthy life. 

The first 24 hours? They‚Äôre rough, but I handled it by running in the a.m. Got a good night of sleep too.

Starting on the second day, I had no interest in running. I could walk and ride my bike, but the pain in my joints kept telling me, Nah dude, running will really hurt. And this sucks, because running, which is so important to my mental health, I didn‚Äôt do, couldn‚Äôt do, and so instead, I took to sitting and chain smoking cigarettes and binging coffee and gulping sugar. Big help this day was talking to my sponsor and psychiatrist, who encouraged me to push through.

Day 3 was when I realized I couldn‚Äôt completely abstain from kratom without medicine. I wasn‚Äôt getting any sleep, maybe three or four hours out of every twenty-four. My legs had to move, lest a sandy sensation would creep to the tips of my toes. So, I went back to the smoke, but only Delta 8. I was taking a big risk, because Delta 8 led me to a full relapse on weed in the past, but getting off kratom was more important to me.

Day 4, unsurprisingly, I hit up my old marijuana dealer. Fuck it, the kratom withdrawals are terrible, I‚Äôll take the harm reduction approach, I thought. And it worked. From this day until today, I smoked to numb some of the kratom withdrawals. It was also this day, when the weed wore off and I was completely 100% sober, I processed the loss of my friend. I couldn‚Äôt feel it when it happened because of the dirt, but without that, and with some early sober time, I could. My first moment of clarity.

The second moment of clarity came on Day 5, again, while I was completely sober from the weed. I realized I was over the worst of it with kratom and my substance abuse disorder. One of the most intellectually and physically challenging actions I‚Äôve ever taken in my life; a task so fucking demanding I filled 220 journal pages pleaing to quit; the pain of my three detoxes, the meditations on never doing it again, never doing it again; all of that done and completed. There will still be hard days, I was warned by my sponsor, but there will be better ones too, more of them, and none as soul-wrenching as being unable to concentrate, sweating and shaking randomly, painful sleeps and nights, a runny nose, joint pains, all for seven days.

6 was rough, but not so rough I recall much about it. I was mad at myself for buying weed, but then I‚Äôd be like, Dude, you‚Äôre off the kratom, you‚Äôve chosen life, and you‚Äôve gone 28 days without it already this year. You got this. Also important to mention that I was working and processing this stuff with two sponsors, and without the responsibilities of a job (lost that the same day I sought sobriety and recovery).

I‚Äôll share a couple of things my sponsors shared. First, my veteran sponsor -- the 65-year-old with 14 years clean -- told me to practice honesty, be communicative, and stay responsible. These three pillars I took to heart, and they got me through the roughest points. I live with and help my parents around the house, and I was able to keep them in the loop as I stayed under their roof, a privilege not everyone has. When I was about to break down and needed weed, I was able to borrow $20. 

My second sponsor told me, One thing at a time. I put off quitting weed, gabapentin (small, non-recreational dose used on day 7 and today), cigarettes, and caffeine, and took to sobriety from kratom with everything I had. Harm reduction worked for me over complete abstinence. Ask your doctor about MAT (medication-assisted treatment) for beating kratom, especially if you‚Äôve got to work and pay bills.

Today is day 8. I got eight hours of sleep last night, no problem. I‚Äôm not at 100% yet, but I‚Äôd say 75%, and only getting better. I was able to sit and concentrate on typing this post for the last two hours. I‚Äôve got a meeting with a sponsor in fifteen minutes, the first time I‚Äôve been out-out in a week, save for two trips to two parks I took on day 5 and 6, very important.

Next is quitting marijuana, and stepping down off gabapentin slowly these next three days. 

Thanks for reading. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. I‚Äôll be more active going forward, need to keep myself busy. Be safe.",11,0

Until this week, I thought I was fine, that I had things completely under control. Then I read something about kratom as a possible culprit of numbness in the hands and it clicked: perhaps the numbness in my hands each morning, that I thought was carpal tunnel-related, is in fact something else? Even if they are unrelated, I knew it was my sign to quit.

I'd read posts on this sub before, as an active kratom user, and very naively thought ""Oh, that could never be me! Surely things won't get out of hand."" Now I'm here wishing I'd never started. I just want to say thank you to everyone in this community. What a group of wonderful humans who've created this treasure trove of information. The wiki and resources are so helpful. This post may be long, but I'm hoping writing it all out will be therapeutic. I hope this post is okay.

I started using kratom a little under three years ago, after my boyfriend (at the time, now ex) said he'd done some research, was interested in trying it, and purchased some from the local smoke shop. I started using very casually at first, taking just a gram. I remember telling him I didn't even feel anything at first! So I started to toy with dosage.

I remember enjoying taking 2-3g and following it with a 1-2g bump an hour later. Clearly I had no idea what I was doing. I was flying high and the queen of positivity and productivity. I finished so many projects! I was a social butterfly! I was positively euphoric! As a lifelong sufferer of anxiety who didn't know she suffered from anxiety, I felt like I'd found the solution to all my problems.

Over time, I turned into a daily user. I really don't remember how it escalated, but I do remember telling my ex that I was afraid I was forming an addiction. He assured me I wasn't and that it wasn't an addictive drug. I would estimate that I've now been a daily user for at least one year, at most 2.5 years. I really can't remember the timeline of transition from occasional/regular user to daily, but am sharing my best guess because I know length of usage can impact one's quitting experience. I would make pills so I could dose at work without raising suspicion. I definitely hid my usage from everyone but my ex.

I think things really went downhill when COVID hit and I started working from home. I could dose whenever I wanted, and my anxiety was at an all-time high for so many reasons: unhealthy relationship, global pandemic, rising work stress. I'm sure there were times when I'd exceed 20 gpd. 

I went out of town for a few days last Christmas to visit my family, and I thought it would be a good time to go CT, even just for the famed ""tolerance breaks"" that I hadn't yet been able to bring myself to do. The first night was fine! The second night was unbearable. I quickly started using again just to make the full body fiery nerves go away. I've been too scared of them to try quitting again, until now. The thought that it's been 10 months since I last tried to quit just makes me feel so ashamed--where would I be now if I'd just quit then? Why did I let another 10 months go by?

I would say my average usage over the past several months was 12-15 gpd in several 2.5g -4.5g doses. This was definitely lower than my highest usage, and I think perhaps was my first silent admission to myself that I knew I wanted to quit eventually.

This past Saturday, I took about 10 g (separated into 3 doses) in a weak effort to cut back, and then took none yesterday. The RLS-like symptoms many of you mention here kicked up last night, after just one low-dose day followed by a no-dose day. I barely slept. I felt like I just had to constantly tense my muscles to try to ""shake it off."" That sensation has to be the most wild, uncomfortable thing I've ever experienced. Does withdrawal really kick in that quickly, or is this just me? Honestly, I'm scared shitless right now. I would someone could knock me out until it's all over.

Today I had three 2g doses throughout the day, just to stave off the nerve fire (it still acted up all day,  making it very hard to work), but with the intent to taper as much as I could. This evening, I took 2g of stem and vein in hopes of getting SOME rest this evening. I also took a magnesium supplement and will probably take a Benadryl before bed to try to knock me out.

I am not sure if tapering or CT is right for me, given the severity of my RLS-like symptoms, but tomorrow I'm going to cut down to 5gpd total, possibly swapping some of that out with stem and vein if my body lets me. 

I have a very intense job juggling lots of projects and people, and I'm so afraid to let people down/develop a bad reputation for any oddities in my behavior that may arise while I quit. At the time, I felt like kratom helped me get to the position I'm currently in; I only wish I'd known what it was actually taking away from me.

I have seen my GP re: anxiety. Though I didn't share with my GP my kratom habit, I did obtain a prescription for anti-anxiety meds that I've now been taking regularly. I do feel like they're helping, but it's hard to know what's been the meds and what's been kratom. 

In general, I just have a lot of fears that I'm sure resonate with many of you (or at least did at some point in time): Am I strong enough to do this when I haven't been strong enough before? Can I make it through the pain? Will my nerves recover? Will I ever feel happy again? Will I always crave it? Can I be my awesome self without it? Who am I, anymore, without it? Will I have terrible mood swings that push people away? How long before I'll be able to sleep again normally without it, if ever? 

I don't expect anyone to have real answers to these questions; everyone is different and I know that, but I do welcome your stories and encouragement. If I don't suddenly go CT, my goal is to taper down to 0gpd by October 1. October is a perfect month, my favorite month of the year ending with my favorite holiday, and I so badly want a beautiful October without kratom. I just want my life back, damnit. 

If you made it this far, from one human to another, thank you for listening. <3

I was thinking that I would love to change my lifestyle as a whole, and then consider quitting kratom. Im doing about 10-15g a day, and not taking anything else. I heard ppl talk about using weed to help them deal with kratom withdrawals (especially insomnia, no appetite and mental frustration)   


I cant do, because well I got into kratom because i got really bad reactions from weed and I have lots of stoner friends. And being sober for 4 months was mainly good, but I was very not sociable at all, and I just couldnt connect with my friends the way I used to and I couldnt help but feel sad and lacking something. Alcohol is not for me, so I got into kratom and it worked amazingly for me for about 3 months.  


Then i realized the tolerance problem and how the habit seeps into other activities and that is when I saw it as a problem, I wanted to be me again. I feel almost fake sometimes and that is truly the numbing effect that it possesses. The addiction is similiar to what I think ciguarettes+milder opiates would feel like. WD for me is full of mental battles and I just want 1 single moment of calmness, but I just keep feeling all wrong and uncomfortable, 98% of times this leads me to drink the green sludge up..  


I tried to taper before and got to 2-3g/day in july but couldnt kick it, also i dont think i have nearly as much willpower span to taper now. so im thinking about CT, but again i am worried that after 5 days I will feel like it is way too bland and boring to be completely sober and go back to it. So maybe thinking about quitting rn isnt the right thing to do and should rather try to get healthier habits and be okay with discomfort and then I will magickly feel like I dont need kratom at all and kick it?! lol idk..  


Considering both, I understand how better my life would be without the everyday frustration and redosing. Saving a lot of time, but yeah with Adhd im worried a lot about if im going to be able to figure it out and be content with no meds or drugs long-term in my life. maybe im going to have to be alone to avoid urges etc..  I want to try 5-htp once I detox from kratom for anxiety problems and then hopefully live a life without so much unnecessary bs I cause to myself",5,0

I haven't had any urges to take kratom; the anhedonia and the anxiety are still very much with me but I'm doing Ok.  So, this post is not as much about kratom as it is about an itch to always be a little bit off-normal.  I wonder if any of you have relevant experience or any suggestions.  

Ever since I've stopped, I have had urges to explore other stuff.  I always have some pot edibles around (legal here) but I also found some old Ritalin and have taken it a few times to get energy to deal with certain tasks; we just moved cross country so there's still unpacking and setting up to do.  I have also been drinking the occasional kava and looking into nootropics (ugh).  I honestly hate being impaired (so I tend towards low doses) but I'm noticing that I am never content with my state of mind/body.  I want to have a little more energy, I want to get tired in the evening, I want to feel a little better.  

I'm realizing that this isn't new.  Prior to the pandemic, there was a huge anxiety cost to taking anything on a work night.  I used to drink back then and I knew for instance that if I drank even a little bit on a work night, I would have a terrible day at work due to social anxiety.  Same with most things, including kratom.  So, I naturally kept any mind-altering experiences to the weekends and that worked fine, to be honest.  After I started working from home, the cost became far smaller.  Sure, a hangover wasn't great for working but it was doable and kratom did not give me much of one.  So, a couple of times per week became a daily thing and then stopping wasn't great.  I had dabbled in many things throughout my life and kratom was the first thing besides coffee that I was actually dependent on.

But the larger question here is, how the hell do I force myself to stay away from everything?  I've had many months of complete sobriety in the past (mostly by accident) and I can't say I enjoy taking supplements/drugs.  I usually regret it immediately and they do make me a little foggy the next day.  But it's like some itch that has nothing to do with enjoyment needs scratching.  Like yesterday, I was building a Lego thing with my kid and I noticed that I was getting exhausted a couple hours in so I took half of an old Ritalin.  I regretted it as soon as it kicked in, the sensation was not pleasant, I became irritable, and I had a bit of trouble going to bed.  So, what's the point?  But some part of me just needed to not be completely sober.  I am very mindful of childcare so I would never had put myself in a situation where I could not handle it or pose a danger but just being ""normal"" wasn't cutting it.

I know that once I have to start going to work, I will have to transition into more consistent sobriety but I would like to figure it out before then.",26,1

Day 28 after my CT. I got locked out of my old account (again) so I have a new one. Things are going really well. 

The good:
So we know music feels amazing now. Well I went to two concerts last week, and let me tell you - live music. Omg. Feeling the music. It felt so amazing that I felt like I was on mollies haha. I didn‚Äôt care about anyone or anything and danced my ass off. Had the time of my life.  

Went out of town. The freedom I have now is amazing. I can go anywhere, do anything, make a last minute plan. Before I wouldn‚Äôt make plans longer than 2 hours (or I‚Äôd be in wd) and I would never spontaneously go from one place to the next. Had to get home & dose. This is the most liberating part.  

I can have fun again. I‚Äôm more of ‚Äúmyself‚Äù than I have been in the past 3 years. I‚Äôm not isolated in my house anymore. I actually message people to hang out and leave the house to do fun things. This is tough because I still have anhedonia pretty bad, but once I‚Äôm there it‚Äôs like it all goes away. Push yourself to do things.  

Also, girls ‚Äî the wap. She‚Äôs back and she‚Äôs intense. Enough said.  

My stomach is a fucking tank now. I can pound shots and beers and not feel even a little sick. Before k I would ‚Äòpuke & rally‚Äô every time I drank. So one positive thing this sludge has done is made my stomach into a machine. Lol.  

My skin looks amazing. It‚Äôs brighter, my lips are plumper like they used to be, my eyes are bright and my pupils are normal size! 

This sub is great, but it‚Äôs also good to take a break from it too. Don‚Äôt let other people‚Äôs struggles psych you out until you adopt them yourself. I stayed away from a lot of the super negative posts in the thick of it. 


Still struggling with:

Anhedonia, no motivation or energy, no patience, and still the bm issues. Like I said, if I sit at home these are all unbearable. If I force myself to do a social activity they basically don‚Äôt exist anymore in that moment. Oh also my hands are peeling a lot. Anyone else? I think it‚Äôs from being so clammy all the time. Last thing is I lost 10 pounds during wd and it‚Äôs got my self esteem pretty low. Trying to force myself to eat as much as possible to hopefully gain it back. I was already ~10-15lbs underweight from the kratom, I was basically anorexic to avoid messing up my dosing. 

Anyway thanks for reading if you got through it. I wanted to make a mostly positive post. Looking forward to hearing from others in a similar quit time as me.",6,0

It's been 3 days since I've jumped and I'm happy to report that I'm not feeling terrible. I was really scared of withdrawals, but it hasn't been horrible. I've been taking some unisom, which is helping me sleep and using a magnesium muscle rub and drinking a lot of water with electrolytes during the day. 

I'm not proud of taking it while pregnant, but I believe I did the right thing by waiting until the 2nd trimester to completely cut out so I wasn't shocking my system. The baby is measuring great and has a strong heartbeat.

Long time lurker, first time poster. I've been messing w kratom since 2018 and it's quitting time again. I had a six month quit in 2020 but got back on thinking I would be really vigilant and only do it once a week/special occasions. I was able to keep from daily use for a month or 2, but the drive to use more and more was there from the beginning and was a constant losing battle. Now I'm back to 30 caps, 3x a day (45gpd). It's tough to keep it even at that level. Even though the extra (or increased) doses aren't even enjoyable any more, I still have to fight to keep at 45gpd. It's likely I'll work in an extra dose today in honor of my first post to QK! (love the endless mind games and bargaining)

Planning to make the jump on Friday. I can't taper for shit, so just gonna try and hold steady at 45gpd for the week and jump off. Haven't been able to get any helper meds either. I could try and find a new PCP, but I‚Äôm in a bit of a time crunch now. Have jury duty coming up on the 30th and I don‚Äôt want to have to try and smuggle a midday dose into the courthouse (although it would be perversely fitting if I could somehow manage to add in legal problems to this mess).

I quit before from a much higher dosage w/ out helper meds (shit, I dunno...maybe 60-80gpd), so I know it's doable.

The day almost didn't come. I think all the events surrounding 2020 and 2021 make quitting probably harder than normal for some, and it certainly was for me. There were tearful moments since ending my Kratom usage... and in those moments, I wanted to feel numb and escape. Several times I thought ""just a couple of those 0.6G Kratom caps would probably help right now"", but I ended up not touching them. I remembered this day a year ago, swearing I would never touch Kratom, in any form, ever again.

I'm glad I didn't cave. As usual in life, low-moments pass, and are filled with better moments. I'm glad I'm not on a substance that doesn't allow me to feel the full spectrum of life.

I posted a few weeks ago when I began a taper from about 27 GPD (taper started on 8/30/21). I wanted to share a little update, and ask some advice from those of you with tapering experience.

I've used for about 3 years, a little over now as we enter into the Fall season. When I first began, I was just using some headshop capsules that I later learned were a combination of normal powder and extract. So when I switched to powder, my consumption was up in the 40s. However, I managed to taper down through very low doses but significantly increased frequency (i.e., .5g every 30 minutes or so until I felt ""normal"") and was able to maintain that for a while; around 5-7gpd, I believe. When COVID hit, and the lock-downs began, I like many others, increased those doses again to cope with the combination of boredom, anxiety from isolation and fear or not knowing how things would progress, etc. My use wavered between 10-15GPD during that time period, usually doing 1g every hour or two. 

About a year and half ago I started a fairly high stress, physically demanding job in a field that I have ZERO interest in, but took out of necessity and have been dealing with a feeling of being stuck; even small stressors can blow up, because my total lack of interest makes me feel like they're just not worth it, if that makes sense.

Anyhow, context aside, I immediately cut down 50%+. I jumped to about 10.5 GPD for a week or so, and then down to 10GPD where I've been for almost 2 weeks. The first week of that leap down was awful, understandably, but I mostly leveled off after 5-6 days; this was the long holiday weekend, and I had also had 4 days off prior, so I was okay to basically be bed-ridden--a luxury I won't really have again for a while. Having experienced some level of success with high frequency approach in the past, that was my initial approach this attempt. Since the taper began, I've done 1.5g in capsule form (I pack the capsules myself, and weigh everything) every 2 hours from 7:00 AM to 7:00PM, eating small meals about 40 minutes after dosing. I thought about trying to just cut down a single dose at a time, so I began with my 3:00PM dose, which has been 1g for the last couple weeks.

But I'm noticing the flaws with this plan. First of all, I'm still having to revolve my day around dosing, since I'm dosing a total of 7 times. I still get the occasional strong agoraphobic reactions to certain errands, or even things like going out to dinner, because it *has* to fit into the window either between 5:00 PM or some time after 7:30PM. I still get anhedonia with some frequency in the evenings, so the latter option is often less appealing. 

This is where I'm seeking advice:

I'm hesitant to increase my single dosage to decrease frequency, because my reasoning for the low and frequent dosing was to avoid the peaks and valleys. It's been a long time since I've done more than say, 3g as a dose. But what I was considering was switching to 2g doses every 3 hours (5 total doses, 7:00AM, 10:00AM, 1:00PM, 4:00PM, 7:00PM), to give my body some more time between, and to reduce the ""building"" effect I sometimes feel, where the later doses feel more effective because of how the half-life seems to work. And from there, start cutting down .5g per single dose every week or so until I can cut one out at a time entirely (likely the morning dose first). Any thoughts? Fortunately, my will-power has been fairly strong, and I never feel a real temptation to take more. But if I were to just take 1.5g every 3 hours, that would be a single jump of 2.5g, and in my mind, would likely cause similar W/D symptoms to my initial jump. So I'm just feeling a bit stuck. Not hopeless necessarily, but in a bit of a jam.

Unfortunately, CT has been something I've tried a few times in the past and was unable to properly adjust and caved every time, so please refrain from telling me to ""just jump,"" if you can. I can't really take time off work any time soon, and given how small the operation is, I can't avoid interactions, and need to remain as functional as possible day to day.

Vitamin c and magnesium is your friend. Get good probiotics in your system on this shit: it destroys gut Flora causing many of the problems you deal with. You're probably also nutritionally defficient b/c of the gut Flora being off and kratom zapping nutrients.

272,2021-09-18 14:28:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/pqrr0r/paws_after_this_long/,PAWS after this long?,"Hi everyone. I quit 190 days ago. There was 1 relapse where I did a shot. It's been 150 days from that shot. I was using powder for about 4 years. 3 or 4 heaping teaspoons a day. Then I switched exclusively to gold caps and shots. Eventually just shots. 1 - 3 per day for 2.5 years. So around 6.5 years total. Back in October 2020 (before I quit) I started getting very strange sensations in my ears and head (fluttering in ear, sudden pressure changes, clogged ears when eating, buzzing, could feel/hear my breathing on my ears drums, and then ringing in my ears). This caused me to begin having intense anxiety like I've really never had before. Panick attacks a few times per week. I continued to use shots not even realizing that it may have something to do with it.  

Finally, in March 2021 I decided to quit kratom. It's now over 6 months since quitting and almost 5 months since that 1 shot relapse. I've been through a plethora of PAWS symptoms over the months like adohenia, low energy, depression, and the worst... Anxiety. The ears and head sensations have improved, but still not back to normal by any means. My biggest concern is that over the last month or so I've become very reactive to temperature changes and am having terrible skin crawling sensations. I'm also very itchy. It's causing me massive anxiety again and the inability to relax. I'm just constantly on edge with itchy/crawling skin and pins and needles feeling. Along with intermittent ringing in the ears and other uncomfortable ear sensations.  

I've been to the doctor and had a physical. Everything normal. Been to a few ear doctors and they have all said different things but the one I trust the most basically said there's no fluid in the ears or anything. He said we can try prednisone to see if it's inflammation causing the ear stuff. Haven't done that yet. I also had a MRI on the ear canals and they were normal (no tumors). In May I started becoming off balance and experiencing sinus pressure so I had an allergy test which returned that I'm not allergic to anything. The sinus and off balance symptoms went away after about a month.  

One other thing to note is that I was rear ended back in april and started getting terrible headaches for 3.5 weeks. This is what caused me to get that one kratom shot when I relapsed.  (The off balance and sinus pressure may be related to this whiplash)

I've been in Therapy for a bit over 2 months and exercising + meditating pretty consistently since then, but here I am still with anxiety, skin crawling, pins and needles, sensitivity to temperature, etc...  Bear in mind that these symptoms do still seem to come in waves. This terrible anxiety started up again about 1 week ago. Before that it was about 3 or 4 weeks since I had gotten any Panick attacks or wasn't able to deal with the strange skin sensations. Skin sensations started just before that with a brutal wave of anxiety for about a week.  

I guess my question is could this still be PAWS after this long? Should I be thinking about medications at this point?

I am already feeling like a new person.,"This has been day 3 of my taper. I hadn‚Äôt planned on doing a rapid taper but I am starting to consider it.  I wanted to share my experience so far for anyone considering tapering. 

I quit CT in February after a 3 year 15-25 or 30 gpd habit. Went through absolute hell for about 11 days. Then so so for 12-17. Then it got much better. 

I relapsed after 45 ish days off of it. And I‚Äôve been taking 15-16 gpd lately. The relapse has lasted 4.5 months. 

Two days ago I went down to 11 grams the first day. That night, I woke up at 4:30 am and took 1.5 grams, went back to sleep, then woke again at 6:30, took 1.5 grams and went back to sleep. 

During the day, I definitely had some real prickly moments, body temp issues, and RLS pretty bad at night. 

The next day, yesterday, I took 11 grams (including the 4 and 6 am doses I just mentioned). Took 1/4 a mg Klonopin (have them prescribed but never take them so even 1/4 mg works well for me. It put me straight to sleep. I had planned to take a gram or so of kratom as well, just so I could maybe sleep till morning, but I slept from 2 am to 10 am (WFH) and didn‚Äôt need it! 

Today I took the 10.5 or 11 grams I planned to allow myself for a week, but tbh, the last two doses (2 g ea) we‚Äôre totally unnecessary. At least, at the time I took them. I had almost no WD symptoms but Bc I had it ‚Äúscheduled‚Äù I took them. 

Now I know why tapering can take so long. At least for me, w the habit still having a pretty good hold on me, I could see myself dragging this out forever. Lol

So, I‚Äôm gonna take another .25 klonopin and magnesium before bed tonight and look at my schedule for planned taper dosing for tomorrow and see what changes I can make to it NOW. 

I can honestly say that over the past 3 days and only taking 10.5-11 grams as opposed to 16 I can already feel the real me again. It‚Äôs incredible and not AT ALL what I expects this to be like. I love it. And even tho it‚Äôs just a taste of being MORE sober and lucid, it‚Äôs serving to light a üî•under me to get this shit done! 

‚Ä¶the incredible lies addiction feeds us. I‚Äôm so so thankful for this community and for the ray of hope I have today. 

Three days ago I wasn‚Äôt even sure I had the WILL to quit. Ain‚Äôt no stopping me now!",6,0

2. Is tapering ( if done with integrity) a major decrease in WD? 

3. Should I see a doctor and consider gabapentin? Is this a difficult script to get?

I realized I numbed myself with Kratom on and off for awhile to deal with a relationship I‚Äôve been in for too long.  My boyfriend didn‚Äôt know anything about this part of my life ( knew I had a history of opiate addiction years back) but never told him about Kratom. 
I am sad and scared to be alone.  I‚Äôve been in relationships for years and leaving this one is terrifying but I need to do it!  I keep getting triggered by him and Kratom took the insecurity away.  This time with the help of naltrexone and lexapro I am going to do it!  It‚Äôs painful as fuck ( excuse my french) as this person has been my best friend, companion and lover for 8 plus years.  I was married before him and before I got divorced I was dating him ( I was separated).  
Maybe TMI but this group has saved me from relapsing and just wanted to put this out there.  We are getting together later and I need to be strong üí™üèø.  Being with him is really difficult as he‚Äôs never lived with anyone or been in a long term relationship.  He‚Äôs a great human being but never took a drug in his life and doesn‚Äôt understand me on many levels.  It‚Äôs hurting my sobriety..   I work a lot and having him was great however, I relied entirely on him and Kratom for awhile.  I know addiction and isolation go hand in hand.  I need to make sure not to do that. I need to quit him like I did Kratom or I‚Äôll be bound to start numbing with something else!
For all the new people, I quit CT ( huge habit 60 plus ) for 5 plus months, relapsed for 7 weeks and had to go through withdrawals again!  No such thing as just ‚Äú one‚Äù vacation day!  
This time, I told my MD and asked for naltrexone.  It‚Äôs a lifesaver!

I‚Äôll start by saying I was a moderate to heavy opiate user (intravenous for the latter part of my using) for 10 years. I got clean initially in 2017 and stayed clean for over 3 years. I used Kratom to spell w/ds during the worst part just to fill my dedication tank to keep going when it got unbearable.

Fast forward 3 years‚Ä¶.the pandemic starts, my 12 step meetings were entirely online which didn‚Äôt help as much. Also, ever since I got clean I had issues sleeping, basically if I didn‚Äôt go to sleep at the exact same time I wouldn‚Äôt sleep for shit and I would ‚Äúwake up‚Äù feeling terrible, headaches, all that good stuff. So instead of a smart person and going to a doctor‚Ä¶I remember Kratom is a thing. I looked into it and depending on what you search for and what subreddit you find, you can get heavily conflicting information. So naturally I get the idea that it‚Äôs basically Cbd for opiates and that there wasn‚Äôt much risk to it if any‚Ä¶.which is quite wrong.

I used whatever 40 caps a day is for over a year of mainly reds for the euphoria. I started out once a week then progressed to daily over the course of a couple months. 

This relapse was different than my original bout with opiates, it wasn‚Äôt about dying, it wasn‚Äôt about losing everything, it was about secrets and isolation. It sucks to only have drug smart friends while using knowing they could notice your pinpoint pupils and call you out.

I finally got the balls to stop. I will admit it was no walk in the park, but I also think I got lucky. The first two days were not fun, all the good stuff like sweats, yawns, little sleep, no comfort whatsoever. However Gabapentin was a life saver, I took one 300mg in the morning and at night and I‚Äôm on day 7 now and feel almost normal. I‚Äôve yawned a few times and blew my nose a feel times, but I slept well, I have no aches, very minor craving, more like a thought really. I‚Äôm not new to w/ds at all and I am astonished at how different this was. CT is the best possible way but I wanted to share my experience, I see little harm in gaba if you take it in moderation and stop as soon as you don‚Äôt need it. I realize 7 days isn‚Äôt a lot, but knowing what normal is and dealing with w/ds multiple times, I am very confident and feel blessed. Will power is everything and I know everyone can do it. Thanks :)",27,1

I haven‚Äôt had any energy for workouts and I seriously questioned just getting back on a 2g dose for a preworkout but I‚Äôm soooo glad I held out.

But now I use it so that I won't get sick. I'm tired of being a slave to this drug, and I want to quit.

Right now I use roughly around twice a day (10 grams each dose, so 20-25 grams a day). I'm thinking about just throwing all my kratom away so that I can't go back to it if the withdrawals are bad. I tried to taper, I started using 15 grams a day but even that got me sick. If I'm gonna get kratom sick, I might as well do it cold turkey I thought. 

My concern is that I'm starting a job a family friend gave me and this is going to be my first time working in my life (I'm 21). The job isn't difficult, I'm just going to be helping him with cyber security stuff that isn't too much work. But I don't wanna appear sick around him either.

Last year on this date, I quit kratom. I lasted 130ish days and then went back on kratom for 200ish days. After 200 days of 8-10GPD I jumped CT. Day 17 today. 

The good: This quit was far easier than the last as far as acutes go. I had next to no anxiety, no muscle aches, and no RLS. Minor insomnia

The bad: Even after 130+ days kratom free, I found my way back into daily use. That is scary - because I don‚Äôt feel as liberated on this 17th day as I did on day 17 of my first quit. 

The good again: I think the lack of liberation I‚Äôm feeling is a healthy dose of fear. I got overconfident last quit, and thought I was invincible. This time around, I know the potential for failure - and I know the consequences. 

For anyone looking to jump: here‚Äôs a common theme I‚Äôve found in both of my quits now. Lower dosage cold turkey isn‚Äôt as terrible as you think it‚Äôs gonna be. Just stay busy and don‚Äôt let your brain trick you into going back when you‚Äôre 130 days in :-)

I was suicidal when I woke up and felt disconnected from reality today, and lost all motivation whatsoever to do anything. I literally stared at a wall for hours. Also all of the financial stress is weighing on my head and I just felt so incredibly hopeless. I'm also fairly new on some psych meds so idk if it could be that. Im talking to my doctor and counselor tomorrow. Does this sound normal for you guys during PAWS or does it sound a little too extreme?

I appreciate the input",21,0

Haven‚Äôt been on here in a while but still not using Kratom. I feel like I might have settled into this life now. It‚Äôs good. No major highs or lows for no reason. I can set a meeting a week from now and I don‚Äôt have to worry about whether the drug will be working the way I need it to for the short time of the meeting. That feels pretty good.

Anyone else?,"Full disclosure, I am on day 20 of CT.  It's going... well, it's going.  Definitely happy I stopped but motivation and sense of wellbeing are lacking.  But, anyway, that's documented in other threads.  

I wanted to share my experience with trying to taper and see if anyone else saw the same issue.  I think I dug myself into a deeper hole attempting it.  About a year ago, I was taking 15-20 g most days but also taking regular breaks (2-3 days per week at least).  That dosage gave me a bit of a hangover and was not as effective after a time so I decided to gradually reduce the dose.  I ultimately wanted to get off but I was afraid of withdrawals interrupting work.  I set a 10 g limit (since the days I took that much, it seemed sufficient), and after sitting there for a few days, I felt great overall and decided that maybe I'll just stay there instead of going lower.  I mean all the negative stuff was basically gone and I was able to reap the focus/energy benefits.  At that point it basically became a daily supplement rather than something I used some nights to get fucked up.  Then, the dosage grew over the next few weeks and I found myself with a 10-20 gpd habit and almost no breaks.  

I feel like if I had just jumped CT instead of tapering, it would have been way easier since it wasn't a daily thing yet.  I don't want to discount tapering when it works, but the potential danger of transitioning into more regular use might be something to consider if you're not at a huge dose.  Maybe try CT first?",7,0

I was dumb and earlier this year started back because of anxiety surrounding the pandemic and family stuff going on. Told myself that it would be ok and I wouldn't get hooked again. WRONG.

My last dose was last night at 8 pm, weird thing is the kratom is starting to not work for me and is making anxiety maybe worse and I didn't sleep last night much.

I want to taper 4x-5x doses (1 1/4 teaspoon /dose) spread out daily and taper from there but not sure if I have the willpower or stamina to eek it out over a month as opposed to taking several days off work and cold turkey again which I know will come with a repeat of PAWS most likely.

My bp was always up, for the past few days it has been normal. The first 3 days I had a lot of RLS and anxiety. Clonidine I had on hand and the gabapentin helped with that..No problems with sleep; Of course that's probably because I took temazepam every night. When I was taking the kratom I didn't even take my sleep meds because I would dose 3 tsps of red kratom. I had no energy whatsoever those first 3 to 4 days.I was sore all over, even Epsom salt baths throughout the day didn't help.I felt better on day 5. I know for sure it was the gabapentin and clonidine which I didn't take much of. Just enough to take the edge off. I Threw out all of the kratom I had in my possession. I am so proud of myself,I know I'm not out of the woods yet but it feels so good to feel NORMAL for a change. I can definitely feel the difference. Now my Dr. is working with me to eventually wein me off of the gabapentin. I promised him I would be honest with him about everything I take from now on.If you're procrastinating, PLEASE know that it is not easy but definitely doable. Weather you taper or CT you owe yourself a healthier lifestyle. I have never had an addiction to any drug or substance until now and I feel so ashamed of what I put myself and my body through. Even wrecked my car one day coming from work cause I was stupid enough to dose before I drove and it made me drowsy. To add.. it wasn't even the red. It was a green strain. It could have been worse. I have ruined friendships and closeness with family because I was in a kratom HAZE for 3 years.

The quitting process has not been particularly difficult (thankfully).  I went CT from 10-20 gpd for about a year and a half.  Days 3 and 4 were awful physically but that gradually tapered off by day 8 or so.  I have no desire to take Kratom (in fact, I thought I had gotten rid of all of it but found a couple of bags in a cup board the other day and I have not had any interest in them).  But, I'm always tired.  I'm not motivated to do anything besides the absolutely necessary (I just started a new job and it's kicking my ass).  I get an occasional workout in and run errands on the weekends but it's like walking through jello: doable but takes herculean mental effort.  I don't remember the last time I enjoyed any activity.  The gaming PC I bought while on Kratom does not interest me, my family annoys me, running (great on Kratom) feels awful.

I've always been kind of depressed and very anxious; the reason I started taking Kratom so often was actually to get through the pandemic and the isolation.  It was awesome for that but the nasty side effects became noticeable about a year in.  So, I am glad I am stopping.  But, I wonder whether I will feel any better mentally/emotionally any time in the near future.  The anxiety makes it difficult to leave the house to do things and doing them feels like shit... I am not sure where to get relief.  I get plenty of sleep, eat reasonably well, exercise, etc. but nothing feels good.

I am aware that this might just be a longer term side effect of quitting but I guess I would like to be reassured of that.",3,1

Any advice or encouragement is welcome. I tapered for 3.5 weeks off of an 8-10gpd addiction I've had for 7 years. It's been 48 days since I last took this awful stuff. I am not doing well. The taper and acute withdrawal weren't fun but totally manageable. I felt very fatigued and had anhedonia for several weeks after the acutes, but felt fine otherwise. I was doing a good job of trying to get some exercise consistently as well as eating more regularly and healthier. Then the depression set in. I just don't care about much of anything right now. I had quit weed, but now I'm smoking it any chance I get everyday to cope. I also started smoking cigarettes again. I get a lot of intrusive thoughts about hurting or killing myself(don't worry I don't plan on acting on them and am seeing a therapist weekly). Normally this sort of loss of progress would really bother me. I just don't care right now. I don't know what I can do to make myself care. I'm telling myself it's ok as long as I stay off of kratom. I'm starting to get really worn down and time has slowed to a crawl. I don't see the end in sight. I need to feel like I've made a positive change since I quit kratom, but I feel worse now. I want to stick with working out and eating right, but I just can't. I have a hard enough time forcing myself to get out of bed or shower and shave. I took kratom to deal with stress and negative emotions. I always felt that kratom blunted my emotions and that quitting would make them return to normal. I feel nothing now. I hate this. I want so badly to get through this, but I'm loosing steam. I'm rooting for anyone else out there having a shit day or week or month. Maybe if we embrace it together, we will emerge on the other side as better people for having gone through this.",16,0

It's crazy to me that it hasn't been more than 20 days, the acutes seem like so long ago now but the depression is still coming in waves. Day 15-18 or something like that were really dark and felt never ending but I feel more like myself now and am excited for the future but really overwhelmed with how much in my life I have to fix now.

Sleep is much much better but I still get nervous when going to bed in case it's a bad night, I think that first week was traumatizing in a way. It's insane how much better my skin looks, I thought I just...looked like that lol. But now I look like a completely different person.

My appetite is still not 100% but I am seeing some improvements and finally have the motivation to cook somewhat. My energy levels are improving as well but motivation is hard to come by sometimes.

I'm really interested to see where my life will go from here, I think I'm realizing the for the past 3 years I've either been on kratom or in PAWs so I am really hoping to stick with it and come all the way out the other side.

I'm bummed that I basically missed the entire summer from being numbed out, it was pretty trippy realizing that leaves are about to start falling and stuff and I barely even noticed they were there. I remember at the beginning of summer I was off k for a bit and was in awe of how green everything was and was so excited to take it all in all summer but then relapse happened and I've barely even been outside. I'm going to hopefully try to get a camping trip and some hikes in but I guess there's always next year.

I'm also realizing I need to come out of isolation, I've been so lonely this year but didn't even notice and now it is really messing with me.

Anyway thanks for reading and to everyone on this journey with me. This sub is amazing and I wouldn't have been able to do it without the support I've gotten here.

I quit after three years daily use of 15-30 grams back in February. What led me to that quit was being sick and tired of being a bitch to kratom. It was a very rough 14 days before I was out of the woods with the WD. I told myself I would NEVER take kratom again. I felt very confident in saying that too.

When I had been clean (off kratom, but had definitely been using other substances still‚Äî ketamine and alcohol primarily) for 42 days, I experienced the biggest trauma of my entire life. Which is saying a lot. 

I began drinking more and more alcohol, which is insanity Bc my past with alcohol CERTAINLY already included many, many consequences already, the least of which was a DUI 4 years ago. 

Then, after the trauma, I was drinking so much alcohol (numbing the pain) that to get over the hangovers, I allowed myself ‚Äújust a gram‚Äù of kratom. You don‚Äôt have to be a psychic to know where this led. 

I got off ketamine, MDMA, Xanax, and alcohol in April. I was not addicted to any of these physically, but most certainly mentally at points. 

My kratom intake slowly crept up to 16 grams over the past 4.5 month relapse. 

I am very proud of myself for abstaining from all other substances other than kratom, but I don‚Äôt know what has changed, but on the current 16 grams daily, I am feeling like my mind is not my own. I am struggling to make it through each day without panic attacks, frantic mood changes, bags under my eyes, stomach issues, I‚Äôve gained weight, and am even having suicidal thoughts. 

I have eliminated everything else from my life. Except kratom. 

I hate myself when I look in the mirror. 

I‚Äôm sick and fucking tired of being unable to live life sober. But I‚Äôm also scared to go thru WD again and to remove my last crutch out from under me. 

This is not the me that I used to be. 


I‚Äôve taken 6 grams today and am trying to find the strength to cut my dose in half today. Any advice or stories similar to mine would be appreciated. üôè",14,0

I feel like my brain goes blank and it‚Äôs really hard to stay focused. I took K because it made me feel extremely happy and motivated, which was perfect as I have pretty big goals and dreams. As we all know, those feelings did not last forever, which has all brought us together here on this subreddit, as a family who understands one another and truly wants the best for eachother (f‚Äôing love y‚Äôall).

-feeling totally dead inside

-sleeping okay, but waking up feeling not well-rested

-skin lost a lot of elasticity and glow

-very weak

-hair is all brittle

Since then I've had two jobs: driving a large truck for a scrapping company and a production manager position for a construction company. The last job was terrible and had me working 60+ hour weeks. It was this job that lead to me starting to use kratom. I was laid off in June and continued to use on and off until 2 days ago. I had a 9 day CT quit, a 4 day and a 5 day. This one was the worst, by far, even though I was only using for 4ish weeks. Now I am reduced to sitting in my underwear on my couch watching TV, as I have zero energy. I don't have a job and haven't been looking since I was laid off. It's quite the contrast to my former life.

I CT'ed at 12gpd, been using for just over 2 years..  I've been tapering for 3 months to get to that point. couldn't seem to get lower no matter how hard I tried so, I said fuck it. the only things I've used to help were a shit ton of vitamins (D3, B complex, zinc, vitamin c, probiotic, folic acid and magnesium) I am also using Gabapentin, which has helped TREMENDOUSLY, so if you can, talk to a your doctor or someone about getting some to use for detox. anyways, here's the play by play in case any of you are ready to jump. idk if anyone actually cares, but I always appreciated the people who posted their updates daily.. so I knew what to expect. I know we're all different, however, I CRAVE the knowledge and don't want to walk into something blind. Anyways; my first day was already posted so starting at day #2. 


#2
well, day two wasn't fun. I'm not going to lie. I barely slept the night before BUT, I did sleep at least from 4am to 7am. so, better than nothing. I've been really worried about sleeping, as I'm an epileptic and lack of sleep is a HUGE trigger for my seizures.. that's a story for another time anyway. 
otherwise, I've felt pretty damn tired until about 3pm. I decided to finally get in the shower and could barely stand, I think my blood pressure dropped or something, so I just sat in the shower and washed myself off. it honestly made a huge difference, but it's freaky to think I might pass out in the shower.. (wouldn't be the first time ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) otherwise, I'm sweating like crazy. cold, hot, cold, hot. I had to sleep under just the sheet because my blanket was just too much. my arms, legs and especially my back are hurtin'. I've not felt absolutely horrible like I expected, but I don't feel good either.. and omg, the sneezing. just never ends. I'm usually a one and done but it's going 4-5x's in a row. my stomach has been cramping a lot as well. over all I just feel really freaking tired. getting up and walking around doesn't hurt but feels unnatural for some reason? but getting in that shower was a mission in a half.. oh also, RLS is a bitch. 


day #3
well, definitely feeling it today. although I actually slept decently last night, I think that's just from pure exhaustion. I passed out again twice today for a few more hours, after a while it's just impossible to keep my eyes open. my back is sore, I'm sneezing like crazy, feels like a bad cold to be honest. appetite isn't any better, but forced myself to eat things. I can tell the bloat in my stomach and swelling in my ankles is going away which is so wild to me. took a shower again today, but felt like I was going to pass out so I just sat down in the shower. felt good to get clean though, I've been sweating/stinking like crazy. not getting as many cold sweats/hot flashes today, which is nice. yesterday was fucking miserable. today is miserable too, just in a listless kinda way. just feel like a drained battery. 
weird thing is, first two days I really didn't have cravings at all. today I had cravings BAD! like, literally day dreaming of stirring kratom in a cup.. ridiculous. I talked myself out of it, and reminded myself why I'm doing this. kratom is shit, makes you feel like shit, and leaves you unmotivated with a fast heart rate. no thanks. oh also, still having RLS.. more like restless feet, but still. it's super annoying


#4
can't believe I made it here, at the same time, it feels like every day has been moving in slow motion.. couldn't sleep last night, but I took two naps yesterday so that's probably why. finally passed out at 1am, woke up at 4:30am to my cat yowling for breakfast üòí been up since then. RLS is still in full force.. which sucks. HOWEVER. I didn't wake up completely drenched in sweat! so! that's something lol. 
anyways, I fell asleep again from 7am-11am.. today is the worst yet. I really thought today would be better, but I was wrong. I've read on here that days 3-5 are the worst, but I thought because the first few days really weren't THAT bad, that today would be better. I'm super emotional. I feel feverish. I'm crying over everything. I'm pretty over it all at this point.. I hate this. I'm nauseous. I'm sweaty. I stink. I'm tired. I'm so sore, even my fingers are sore. I'm tired as hell.. just. ugh. getting up to get water made me feel really light headed.. also, you guys weren't wrong about the emotional aspect of kratom withdrawal.. I've been crying at random over the tiniest of things.. I'm not a cryer. I hate this lol I managed to actually take a shower standing up! so, that was cool. every time I eat I feel so nauseous though.. RLS stilllllll going unfortunately. man, I had some badass heart palpitations tonight too. was sitting in bed texting a friend, felt a flutter in my chest and BAM, heart was pounding suuuuper hard! which of course sent me into a panic attack ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I've got some serious health anxiety and that shit sent me spiraling for a minute. did some breathing exercises on my couch, then I was fine. but, man.. that scared the hell outta me.
I will NOT use kratom again, I never want to go through this again. 

#5
damn.. almost been a week. longest week of my life.. Jesus hell. 
good news is, I slept pretty good last night. still had trouble falling asleep and didn't get to bed until midnight, woke up once at 4:30 because cat was hungry üòê then woke up for good at 7am. so, not to shabby. annoying part is, as soon as I woke up, I felt good. once I started moving around, I didn't. face flushed, sweating, feeling hot/weak.. again. ugh. my limbs feel heavy.. my stomach is upset and food sounds absolutely repulsive. every time I eat I feel nauseated, so I've only been eating a little bit at a time. I took a shower and actually felt pretty good afterwards.  honestly, I feel way better than I did yesterday at least. my spirits are up. I don't feel dead and over it all, like I have the last 4 days. I think I'll feel pretty good tomorrow. 


#6!!
holy hell. i can't believe it's been 6 days. woke up at four god damn thirty (THANKS AGAIN, CATS) but, I didn't feel like shit. I wasn't sweating bullets when I awoke. I wasn't sore all over. I didn't feel nauseous. I didn't feel tired even though I only slept 4 hours. my pee still smells like kratom, my sweat still smells like kratom.. still have some RLS. what's weird is it went from being an entire leg thing, to just restless feet, and now like, restless toes? I have just been wiggling my toes a little and that's it. I don't remember this with Norco withdrawal, but that was some years ago. I was actually able to put on make up, dress out of my PJs and not feel breathless/worn out. I vacuumed and cleaned the house, cleaned my bathroom.. I found some extra bags of my kratom powder and threw them in the trash. garbage day is tomorrow. good riddance. 
 man. I feel soooo dramatically better than I did yesterday. this was all totally worth it. not even having cravings or anything. 


DAY #7!!?
wow. can't believe it's been a week! that's so wild.. also, shouldn't have complained about waking up at 4:30am every day, as today I woke up at 2:30am. BY. MYSELF.  restless feet/legs still going. had too much on my mind and COULD NOT get comfortable/back to sleep.. üò© otherwise, I feel ok. not that tired to be honest but know I will probably be passing out at noon lol nothing is hurting, not sweating profusely, no nausea. nothing. feel pretty normal. 

yeah, well. typed all that in the morning. I fell asleep for a bit around 8am, and my daughter woke me up asking for a pencil, even though there's an entire box of pencils that's been on my dresser for months üòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I was so sad. so tired. I am still getting some hot flashes/random coldness. I'm used to running really hot allllll the time (thanks kratom) so, I assume my body is still adjusting it's temperature.. it's about 100 degrees out where I live. I really wanted to try to go outside and do something with my daughter, but the heat is just intolerable. still not much appetite, which to be frank, and vein for a minute, is fine with me. I'm one of the weirdo's, who took kratom and ended up being endlessly hungry while on it. I gained 40lbs in 2 years... üòê I lost 8lbs over almost 3 months while tapering, and now I've lost another 3 this past week. so, not pleased about the appetite, not mad about it either üòÇ. I also stopped taking the gabapentin today. I didn't want to use it more than 5 days. for all you guys who are getting ready to CT, and got some gabapentin to use. tread lightly. I used these (although, in MUCH higher doses) to quit my Norco habit, and didn't realize that Gabapentin is also, very addictive, and has a HORRIBLE withdrawal. this time around, I took 3-4 100mg pills a day. but back then I was taking 300mg pills, 5-8x's a day.. I was really stupid and reckless back then, and obviously not ready to be sober. so, I plan on never having to withdraw from drugs again, so I stopped taking gabapentin today. maybe that's partly why I still feel kinda eh? yesterday I legitimately felt high on life! I was so jazzed for the day, I got so much done, I picked up my daughter I FELT GOOD. today, not so much. 
well, can only go up from here I guess. I'm just honestly, super proud of myself for even doing this. because on day one, I was already trying to talk myself out of it, ""what if I'm not ready? what if I fail? what if i can't even make it 24hrs like the last two times?!"". don't let your mind fuck with you. if I can do this, LITERALLY anyone can! 

day 8..

I slept for NINE FUCKING HOURS YOU GUYS! I am an avid sleeper. I cannot express how much I LOVE to sleep. it's one of my favorite things.. lol. so not sleeping good for 7 days was killer for me, and honestly one of the biggest things I was worried about. But honestly, just the fact that I could sleep AT ALL I was so thankful for. when I quit Norco, I would be awake for 48 hours sometimes, it was terrible. so, I'm really really grateful I slept so hard last night. I woke up once at 3:30 and said NOPE, and went straight back to sleep until 7. yaaaay. ah I'm so happy. yesterday was a pretty bad day, I felt so debilitated, beyond exhausted. I barely made it into the shower before bed, barely touched my dinner that I was barely able to make... today seems much different already. I am still sweating. still getting shivers, and the sneezing hasn't ended but, that's a far cry from the last week. I haven't even noticed restless legs today, part of the reason I was never able to fall back asleep before. OH! I also have this really nice, black, down feather blanket that I LOVE. I haven't been able to use it all week, because I just get too fucking hot. so I've been sleeping under a sheet for 7 freaking days.. until last night. I slept under my blanket the entire night. so. that must be some kinda improvement right there. thinking I'm finally coming out the tunnel now. 

so odd side notes, possible TMI but figured people wanna know anyway, and I don't remember what day they started but it was recently. the first few days I was still constipated as hell, only over the last 2-3 days have I had diarrhea and not even that bad. just once a day. 
also, other weird thing that's been kinda fucking with my health anxiety; my pee has been clear. like, barely yellow. and I'm a BIG water drinker. I drink almost a gallon a day and have for years, but I also was drinking 2 monsters or 2 redbulls a day, and drinking kratom all at the same time. so during my use, it seemed like my pee was also some strong yellow color and often smelled bad. the last 2-3 days, my pee has been really clear. I think honestly this is because of not having kratom in my system. if you've never had chronic health anxiety/panic, my brain basically sees one thing that's POTENTIAL wrong and immediately spirals into obsessive thoughts and panic over it.. it's really annoying so, initially I thought ""great, something is wrong with my liver or kidneys"", but after some research.. not so much. my pee is just clean. clear. the way it's supposed to be when you're not using drugs and staying hydrated üòÇ this is such a weird adjustment for me.

Also, something really sweet and eye opening.. 
My boyfriend and I were face timing yesterday and he said ""please don't take this the wrong way, but you look so much better! Your face looks so much better!"" üòÇüñ§
My daughter also said my eyes seemed brighter. It was so sweet.. let that be another testament to how much kratom ruins you and your body.


One more thing I wanted to add in here. I know we're all terrified of withdrawal. I know I was.. that's why I've kept using even knowing it's destroying my physically and emotionally. But this is what I did; firstly, I became absolutely DONE with kratom. It made my depression worse, it gave me HORRIBLE anxiety/panic attacks. I became agoraphobic. Idk who I even am anymore because of kratom.. this person isn't me. I used to go out and see people often, I was way more peppy and spunky and sassy.. over the last two years, that person has faded away completely. Idk who I was on kratom, but I didn't like her. This was my invisionment to help me quit. 

Picture a huge years long calendar in your head. From January to December, straight down. It's a long ass calendar right? 365 days to be exact! Now.. highlight a week anywhere on that calendar. That's what we're scared of. That's it. 7 days. That's all were scared of. 7 days of cold/flu like sickness. This helped put a lot into perspective for me, I hope it does for you too.

I quit countless times but none of them seemed to stick.... until now. 4 weeks ago I was rushed to the hospital and I had an acute brain hemhorrage  that caused me to have a stroke. When things really set in about what happened to me, I quit Kratom and vaping and haven‚Äôt looked back since. I don‚Äôt think I ever could chance it. I will say the doctors don‚Äôt think Kratom or vaping alone caused all of this because I had multiple medications in my system, I had a couple drinks that day and was under severe stress and over exerted myself while hiking which set the whole thing off and I‚Äôm so lucky to be alive and healing. It was small so I will make a full recovery but holy shit, it was enough to knock me on my ass and look at how fucking shitty I treated my body. I‚Äôd rather be sober, healthy and alive than to ever inhale or ingest something not good for me ever again. I still have severe health anxiety and had a panic attack over it tonight which sucks, but honestly feeling things and working through my emotions is helping me heal from al this trauma. I hope y‚Äôall stay safe and healthy, cus shit can get real at any moment.",17,0

But here I am. There‚Äôs a lot going on in my head. Did I make the right decision? How will I get energy now? Can‚Äôt I just use it intermittently and be fine?

The worst thing I‚Äôm wrestling with is that I have zero energy to give to my workouts. The other thing I should mention is that 7 weeks ago I transitioned to a carnivore/keto diet. I have a lot of allergies and some inflammation, a little weight to lose, so I‚Äôve been trying out this woe to see if it helps. The diet has been great in many ways. 

The issue is it also takes quite a bit of time to adjust to that woe so I tried to be kind to myself and get that started first before I attempted to quit kratom. So I did a month long taper then jumped at about 2g. 

Long story short, I‚Äôm exhausted most of the time, my body aches and hurts, it‚Äôs just trying to heal and adjust in these different ways right now. And it‚Äôs hard. 

I just want to be back to where I was before all of these changes where I was able to put in 5-6 hard workouts every week and it felt so good. I was making progress building muscle for once in my life. I was sleeping better (my best workout time is in the evening), and I had a good flow going. 

I don‚Äôt expect many people to be in my shoes as far as quitting kratom and also starting a keto/carnivore diet, I just want to know if my body will ever get back to where it can withstand good workouts again without requiring kratom. Kratom was the best preworkout I ever used so I‚Äôm having a hard time with this mentally. 

I‚Äôd hate to start using it again for that purpose bc we all know that‚Äôs a slippery slope. :/

For reference, I‚Äôm 41F, if that makes any difference.",6,0

I usually would never use THC at work -- I'd get paranoid and worry about talking to clients, but for some reason all it does to me is make me a bit more relaxed.  Maybe that's because I've been smoking a ton at night and on the weekends which I usually do not do.  In any case, this is actually not too bad!

Running around with a bag and a spoon, dumping power down my mouth while driving, toss and wash mishaps resulting in choking until I nearly passed out, having to sneak out to the car during the rare times I went outside (basically have done as little as possible, instead of really pushing myself), having fear of accidentally leaving my stash somewhere and running out, telling people it's just a tea related to coffee, lying to myself that I'd quit next week, next month... it's all bs.

Here's what worked for me.,"Before I start this I just want to preface by saying that this is what personally worked for me. I wouldn't recommend doing this if you don't know how your body typically responds to ADHD meds that are stimulants, because it could just make your problems way worse, especially if you aren't diagnosed with it. If you meet all the criteria above and you know your body, your current mental state, what effects stimulants have on you, then I'd say it may be worth a shot.

&#x200B;

Now what I did was real simple. I took my meds. I took my prescribed adderall on day 4 where I was struggling immensely to keep on going, and it gave me the boost I needed to get through the day without wanting to shoot myself, and it kept me laser focused on the task at hand. Amphetamine compounds like this also have anti-inflammatory effects, and can also clear out a runny nose, watering eyes etc.. 

45 minutes after taking my meds the withdrawal effects were completely evaporated and replaced with the typical ADHD stimulant kind of mental and physical effects. If you have taken these medications for a long time you know what I'm talking about. Grinding your teeth, clammy hands, vasoconstriction, dry mouth, obsessiveness, laser focus, feeling like a shell of your actual personality and so on. Now that might sound like it sucks, but for me I'd take the typical amphetamine stimmed out feeling with a kinda sucky comedown over an opiate withdrawal any day of the week. Plus I've known this feeling since I was 7.

As everyone on this subreddit says constantly like an anthem, you have to keep yourself active no matter how hard it may be. For people like me, taking your medication may be the key to get yourself back on track and to get your routine back during withdrawals. Hopefully I can end some peoples suffering by sharing this info.

I found that it helped with sleep and restlessness. At the time, I worked in a fairly high-stress job, managing over $500 million dollars for individuals and high net-worth families. It was hard to shut down my brain at the end of the day, but I found that kratom helped me relax. I never took extremely high doses, but it got to the point of dosing 1.5g to 2g up to 5 times a day for 5 years.

Reason for quitting: Frankly, Kratom makes me feel stupid and tired. Often times, I'd be tired the next day after taking Kratom to help me sleep. In order to come back to a ""normal"" state of mind, I would take more kratom. After years of doing this, I eventually felt my mind becoming very dull. I'd find my self stuttering and having trouble finding words. Internally, I could process thoughts at normal speeds, but I would have a lot of trouble externally communicating it. I would know what I wanted to say, but have trouble finding the words. My speech would be slow, stuttered, and stupid-sounding.

Last dose: 09/06/2021. About 5 grams before bed, mixed with a chamomille tea. My kids are quarantined from school this week, so I'll be working from home. It will be stressful, but in some ways, it will be nice to avoid any withdrawal symptoms from the comfort of my own home, instead of my office. When motivated, I have a very strong will-power, so I'm going cold turkey from here on out....

Day 1: I woke up, as normal... groggy. I drank plenty of coffee in the morning while getting work done, then took a nap around noon, when my kids sleep. After the nap, I felt great! My brain feels far more functional than when I'm taking kratom. I feel some cravings, but they aren't as bad as I expected. Falling asleep was a little difficult; I felt jittery and restless, but stayed asleep most of the night.

Day 2: Waking up was much easier today. I woke up with noticeably more energy, but my energy begins to wear off around lunchtime. Normally, I'd take a dose to power through this, but instead, since I'm working from home, I decided to take a nap. The cravings really aren't too bad today. Falling asleep is the hardest part, as my whole body feels restless.

Day 3:Pretty much more of the same at this point, but I continue to wake up with more energy despite getting less sleep. I'm having some mild stress and anxiety, but it comes and goes in waves. Work and being home with the kids keeps my mind busy, which is good, but I feel that anxiety and stress is amplified from withdrawals. On a positive note, though, my mind is feeling great! Words are easily coming to me and conversations are natural and easy. Falling asleep is still a little difficult, but I took 3mg of melatonin, which helped.

Day 4: I woke up with energy and feeling very mentally clear. Throughout the day, I find myself stressed to be taking care of two small children while trying to work, but I think this is normal, and not attributed to withdrawals, but sometimes that is hard to distinguish. I do believe that stress is amplified from the withdrawals. Fortunately, my wife is taking a half day from work today to help with the kids. By the end of the day, I'm worn out from a long week of work while taking care of two children. I find myself going to bed stressed and anxious and it's hard to distinguish normal life stress from withdrawal symptoms. The good thing is that I'm very tired and find myself falling asleep about an hour early from my normal routine.

Day 5: It's college football day, and we're having friends over to watch games while we BBQ. Today is great. No stress. No anxiety. Conversation comes easy and naturally without the mental blocks of kratom. I drank 6+ beers throughout the day, which probably nullified normal withdrawal symptoms, but overall, I'm feeling really good.  My only complaint is that my stomach is cramping a little bit and I don't have an appetite. Sleep comes easy tonight, but probably because of all of the beer.

Day 6: Today is by far the worst day. I wake up mentally clear and with energy, but about 2 hours into being awake, I feel as though I drank waaaaaay too much caffeine. My heart is racing, my legs are restless, I can't stay still or keep my mind focused. In addition, my stomach hurts and I don't have an appetite. Despite having plenty of energy, I take a nap in the afternoon. It helps at first, but the anxiety came back strong in the evening. Before bed, I read articles on kratom withdrawals and find that, perhaps, I'm having more symptoms than I realized. When I keep my mind busy, the symptoms stay in the background, but today is Sunday and I don't have much to do except set around and focus on my discomforts. Today sucks and so does trying to sleep. I find myself anxious and restless most of the night...

Day 7 (today): I woke up about 1.5 hours earlier than normal. I hardly had any quality sleep, but despite that, my mind feels energized and rested. Despite that, I wake up feeling anxious. I believe a lot of it is anxiousness about the symptoms of withdrawals that I'll feel throughout the day. I'm not sure if the anxiety is physical or a self-fulfilling prophecy. I'm ready to get back into the office and into a routine of work around other adults. The tiredness throughout the day has subsided substantially.

During my quit one of the lingering symptoms was terrible sweating, especially under the arms. I was changing shirts multiple times a day, wearing only black, avoiding leaving the house etc. It sucked. Finally, I did some research and said what the hell, bought the DuraDry 3 part system. After 1 day my sweating is almost gone. Do it. It works, and you should not let this one symptom affect your life. Especially after you have made it through acutes. 

Note: I am not sponsored by or affiliated with DuraDry in anyway. I just wanted to share something that has worked for me. It sounds silly but it changed my life, I don't have to worry about constant under arm sweat marks.

I have been a daily user of Kratom for about five years (with a six month break in the middle). I first started using it for pain, but found it also was a temporary stress relief as well. I thought at first I would be fine and not get hooked because I only used it once or twice a week. That once or twice turned into three or four times a week to daily to multiple times a day. I worked myself up to about a 35-40 gpd habit.

After a couple years of daily use, I decided to quit. I tapered down to about 20 gpd over two weeks. I was feeling pressure from my girlfriend at the time (she thought I was not tapering fast enough), so I stopped cold turkey from there. What a terrible time the next two weeks were. Felt like I did not sleep for a week and a half accompanied by all the usual opioid withdrawal symptoms. But, I kicked the habit. This lasted six months.

Six months later, the pandemic hit. The day the stay at home orders came into affect, my girlfriend and I also broke up. With this stress and chronic pain flaring up, I fell into the trap again. This time my habit only grew to 15 gpd though.

Having gone through what I did before, I don't really want to do that again. Over the last month, I have cut down to 10 gpd. My plan is now to taper down at .5g/day.

For those wanting to quit cold turkey, don't let me scare you away from it. If you can or are, more power to you. I think the difficulty of it can be good motivation to stay quit.   

I will try to post on the daily check in thread through the next few weeks.",4,1

It's like jumping through a portal back to the dark days. Back to the moment when it sank in that I couldn't keep doing what I was doing.

Back to the sweating, the nausea, the dull coat of green powder covering every surface of my bedroom. I had just taken my tenth dose of the day. Three heaping tablespoons, wrapped in toilet paper. It hit me like a brick. Something inside of my head just snapped. I mean that literally. My brain, my soul, my mind. However you choose to define the human capacity for thought and emotion. It came loose. I felt it, sliding around inside my skull as I lay sweating on the carpet in the flickering blue light of the television.    

My room was spinning, my body was coated with a slick sheen of cold sweat. I had already been tapering, but that was the last dose I ever took. And then there were five straight days of sleepless nights and leg cramps, when my body couldn't decide if it wanted to curl up on the ground or go for a walk. 

And then, when that finally passed, I was forced to reckon with the miserable wretch I'd become while I was stumbling around in the green fog. Hair and fingernails overgrown, teeth caked with black tartar, three weeks without a shave. I had packed on 40 pounds of soft bloat. Constantly, constantly, constantly, I sweated. Even on a cold day I would have two huge patches of dark sweat under my armpits at all times. It had once been my chief ambition to save up enough money to cancel out my student loans in one lump sum, so I could go back to school and find a career that involved something more than mindless labor. I had been $500 short when I tried kratom for the first time. At the time of my last dose, I had $200 in my bank account.   

Two weeks into PAWS, and I couldn't conceive of a life where anything mattered. Food was a chore. My dog was a burden. Entertainment, money, politics, weather, all just stale shadows in a colorless world. The future seemed to be one long winter of grey rain and cold wind. I was a dead man walking.

It was a nightmare. If you're going through it right now, then you understand better than I do. But you can't understand what it feels like to revisit those memories with a clean and healthy mind. Three months. I had suffered for three months to purchase freedom. It seems so cheap in retrospect. 

I remember the raw exhilaration I felt on the day when I realized I was happy again. It was Saturday and Spring had finally come. The air was warm and the sky was blue. I'd just got back from the park with my dog. We'd played some fetch and had a picnic. I came home and my nephew was in the kitchen with his mother, cooking dinner. There was a package waiting for me on the table. A boxset of DVDs from Studio Ghibli. And it all came together. I was excited to watch a movie. To sit down on my bed and just enjoy some mindless entertainment. For the first time in forever, I was looking forward to something.  ‚Äã

And it didn't stop. I was suddenly looking forward to everything. A hot shower, a clean home, a nice meal. It all felt good. Hiking, swimming, traveling. Paying off my debt, going back to school, finding a career and building a life. It all came back. I won't pretend like I haven't hit any rough patches, but none have been as rough as addiction. And all it took was three months. Twelve weeks. 90 days. 

What were you doing 90 days ago? What have you been doing since then? Imagine you could go back and tell yourself that things were going to be different. You had taken back control and set things right. What you had feared the most, that boredom would consume you and happiness would be gone forever, hadn't happened. Imagine you could browse r/quittingkratom and instead of being reminded of the suffering you're going to endure, you'd be thinking about the contentment you feel right now.

Imagine it's three years later and kratom is a distant memory. It's been months since you've thought about it, years since you've craved it. You're not an ex-addict anymore. You're just a human, but now you've become habituated to the experience of genuine humanity. You've forgotten how great freedom feels. But you can just check out this sub and it all comes back. It's like you're back to that first morning when you started laughing again. It feels like you're snuggled up to the fireplace while a thunderstorm rages outside.         

I hope you can all feel this good one day.",69,0

I started for the first time in 2018 during my first separation from my husband. We got back together and started using it together thinking it was no big deal since there wasn‚Äôt much information about it (and I wasn‚Äôt a Reddit user yet).

Around that time, I noticed my anxiety and depression heightened and I became a bit of a recluse. I didn‚Äôt make the kratom connection BC I thought I was unhappy w my husband. I quit for the first time and it wasn‚Äôt long before life stressors put me back on it.

The second time I quit was a bit of an accident. It was my 30th bday and I was spending a month in France. Afraid to travel with it, I didn‚Äôt bring it thinking it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. I ended up sleeping that whole first week but assumed it was just the jet lag. It was really easy to quit in a beautiful place. 

Now, because of quarantine and my impending divorce, I‚Äôm taking more kratom than I ever have before. I had become a shell of myself. I have become agoraphobic, i watch TV on the couch all day and I have no friends or hobbies anymore. Once again, I attributed this to the pandemic and my marriage troubles. But it wasn‚Äôt until I started looking back on all the patterns and read these posts here that I realized my mental health and everything else in my life was so much worse off with kratom in the mix. 

After two weeks of waking up with restless legs (brought on because I can‚Äôt seem to go more than 5 hours without kratom), I‚Äôve decided it‚Äôs time to stop. It will be a lot harder BC I have less activities and the agoraphobia is so strong. I‚Äôm also alone as my husband had moved out. But I‚Äôm determined to beat this.

In the past, id usually go CT. But with the amount I‚Äôm taking now, I‚Äôm afraid that‚Äôs not possible. Im about 4 hours into my tapering journey and already getting some of the hot flashes and sweats. I‚Äôll try and wait another hour before I dose again.

At a low dose like this, money isn‚Äôt an issue, and I‚Äôm not feeling much of a high. I‚Äôm dropping .5g every 2-3 days, except times where I can tell my body needs to adjust to that dose, so I‚Äôll leave it 4-5 days. So I can continue to drop, and dose at very low amounts. 

Should I wait til I‚Äôm all the way down at .5gpd and sit there for a bit til I jump? That‚Äôs currently what I‚Äôm inclined to do, just want to hear others‚Äô experiences.

I got off it for three-ish weeks last December and it's gotten out of control so quickly again.  I'm gonna need your support and wisdom through this once more.  I am dealing with a breakup, working full-time and going to school full-time and this next week is going to wear me to a nub but I've tasted the freedom in being my authentic self too many times to not give this another go.  For anyone quitting today or in the last few, or especially those thinking about jumping off this monster of a plant- let me include a few things I've learned from this subreddit that have kept me in the battle against the sludge:

1) It's not giving you anything you don't already have

2) If you keep postponing the decision, please don't beat yourself up over it.  The time will come and you'll feel ready to do it in a way that just hasn't arrived yet. I promise you.

3) The discomfort of withdrawal is best looked at from the perspective that your body feels that way because it is repairing itself as it returns to its stasis.  This is something I know I'm going to struggle to keep in mind over the next week too, but it does happen to be literally 100% true.

I want to end this post by saying I am far more energized as I type this than I have been on any kratom peaks over the last 9 months of abuse.  I am being fueled by the excitement of regaining my life again, all the ups and downs and wonderful surprises that are going to come with that.  I am proud of myself for making this choice once again to meet life on life's terms rather than being numbed out by a stupid plant that doesn't care one bit about me.

Love to all of you!  Encouragement much appreciated!  I'll check back in with my progress soon.",17,0

I‚Äôve used kratom since the pandemic began (~18 months). Initially, I‚Äôd just take a teaspoon in the evening but at the end I was it throughout the day, maybe 40-50 grams per day. 

I decided to start limiting myself, which was surprisingly easy until I decided to just use the whole leaf in the evening. Apparently that is significantly weaker than the powdered form, and I started to go through withdrawals, and decided to take the dive and quit outright. I‚Äôve been going through withdrawals for 11 days now, and have been completely off for 6 days.

Almost all of the withdrawal symptoms are gone except for insomnia and some digestive problems. My anxiety, which was my reason for starting kratom, is dialed up to ten, which feels like an intense weight on my chest at night. I‚Äôve had this feeling for as long as I can remember but it has never kept me up all night. 

My doctor said I could have generalized anxiety disorder, and has prescribed Lexapro and a temporary low dose of Ambien to be used every other night. Neither is helping. I‚Äôve also tried melatonin, magnesium, exercise and breathing exercises, with nominal effect. 

I have no desire to go back using kratom to manage my anxiety, but I am eager to get a good nights sleep. How long does it normally take to be able to get back to normal sleep?

I don't drink water as much as I should throughout the day usually at night but that along with weird urinary issues I have read about countless K users having a feeling like they have to pee all the time.

Hope you all are staying strong on your quitting journies. Thought I'd share an update on my experience.

I feel way better overall with regards to sleep, energy, mood, bowel movements (log poops!), etc but there are a couple things I can't seem to shake.

Every day since quitting I get noticable heart palpitations and shortness of breath when exerting any kind of effort (walking up stairs, picking something up, etc). Pre-quit I had an extensive background in powerlifting and conditioning and would almost always dose before doing these things (average of 10-20g/day over 3 years).

Since quitting I can't seem to workout without getting a pounding heart or the sensation I can't get a full breath. In the first 2 weeks it was pretty much impossible to exercise. After some improvement it seems to have plateaued.. 

I'm 100% in this for the long haul. I simply want to get back to the active lifestyle I enjoy. If anyone has had a similar experience and has tips on what they did to lessen the symptoms I'd love to hear them. Right now I'm confined to walks/yoga/breathing exercises. Taking magnesium, vitamin c+d,  fish oil. <100mg of caffeine per day. I completely understand this could simply be a game of time.

I'm not sure how much I've been taking, but the last 6 months I'm sure I'm using 50-60gpd, maeng da and green horn.

I know CT is the best way to do it, but I was at way too high of a dose, couldn't taper, and I'm not strong enough to handle those type of wds.  I'm too dehydrated and unhealthy, and have no cash for OTC meds to help my wds. 

I need some advice going forward.  Did shutting down for a week to flush as much as I could, while taking as little as I had to, help me or hurt me?  I'm going to have to take small doses to get through work next week, but I want to jump off shortly after that and go all the way. If anyone has advice how to proceed, I would greatly appreciate it.

The first week was hellacious anxiety.  I had to leave work one day with a panic attack.  The mind would not shut up.. Fortunately I had clonodine prescribed for the bp, which helped.  The physical symptoms were not too bad, but the continuing anhedonia and lack of energy is getting me down.

So I have got my mind right and I have been tapering from 50gpd down to 35 gpd over the past 2 weeks.  I am dosing to maintain function and no longer dosing to get high(thank god this mindset changed and I have definitely had enough of this hamster wheel).  I started this by taking a Saturday and going 20 hrs without a dose(last dose friday eve and next dose saturday eve).  I was mostly just feeling crappy (like in quicksand feeling) but getting through it and feeling confident.  At hr 20 the RLS started.  I‚Äôve kicked a fiorinal with codiene addiction(8 per day and they have that nasty butalbital in them) years ago.  That was a solid month of feeling miserable, but the RLS I experienced with K has been unbearable.  It felt like a minor shock in my stomach that flows out like a wave through my chest, arms, and legs.  I tried breathing and hoping it would pass but it just kept coming (so I ended up taking 1.5 grams which ended the waves after another 30 min or so).  Since that Saturday I have managed to keep intake at around 35gpd.  The week was going good, staying on track (planning on dropping to 28-30gpd range this weekend).  This morning at 5am I woke up with the worst version of the RLS I had yet to experience.   Normally I am able to sleep through the withdrawals(although sometimes the K can keep me up until 11-12 at night) and get an average of 6-7 hrs.  Even sometimes able to wait a few hrs before dosing in the morning.  Last evening dose is usually 730-830 pm.

I realize K is not linear and that any drops usually become apparent the third day, but just curious as to how folks got through the severe RLS.  I was only imagining that by day 2-3 of a CT I would be looking for a roof to jump off.  I am ok with suffering, flue, fever, headache, even some anxiety and rebound depression but I sincerely just don‚Äôt think I can get through weeks of that level of RLS.  The liposomal vitamin C I have been eating like candy seems to help everything else, but I was truly shocked by the RLS severity.  Hats off to those who have made it through this(huge love, empathy, and respect).  I don‚Äôt know how you did it or if maybe it is worse for some than others with the RLS.

I did take a viagra the night before and that could have had something to do with it as I know benadryl is horrible mixed with K in causing RLS(made that mistake only one time).

I will get some Highlands Restless Legs, continue slowly dropping with the taper‚Ä¶but I guess what I am wondering is if I should just call a telemed and get gabapentin/clonodine (go CT and get this hell over with).

I thought a gradual taper might be the best for my body, but if it ends with similar RLS I may need meds?
I am confident I can get back into the gpd range next few weeks although I hear it gets much harder getting to the 8-12 gpd(and dropping below that down to zero).

I take magnesium and at least 5-6 of the suggested supplements daily now including bso and 5htp.

Damn it this sucks, feel so stupid for getting in this mess.  My wife and I are so truly blessed and I thought K would be a miracle for my anxiety (which it is except the part where you are üíØ a slave to the doses/wd).

Hoping pushing through on the taper and getting to under 5 gpd eventually might lessen the severity of the RLS.  I promise I am not a lightweight but that was just ridiculous on the past two occasions it came raging in.

Wish I had never been ‚Äúsmart enough‚Äù to research Kratom.  My anxiety was bad, but this K lifestyle definitely isn‚Äôt sustainable.",3,0

I'd love to express my whole journey thus far, but I have little energy, so I ask:

Has anyone dealt with seemingly random, acute-onset dizzyness that lasts 6-7 hours and then fades before sleep?

The first 5 days of my quit I didn't really have dizzyness, just a headache, gi pain, soreness, etc. On day 6 it felt similar to all the other days until about 5 hours into my day at 3pm where I started to get more and more dizzy. It was so bad I almost went to the ER and I would have if my husband wasn't there, just incredible dizziness and anxiety and felt so fucking wrong to be experiencing.

Other than that, ive been dealing with headaches constantly though advil and apap kinda help take it away. I was using magnesium glycinate for headaches but I fear they may have attributed to the dizziness so I stopped today. 

I have absolutely no cravings for kratom, and things were hard at first but with this dizziness it feels like things are getting even harder? It's not something I expected into the 7th day, where I still feel kinda dizzy though not nearly as bad as last night. It is worth noting as well I have been drinking a fuck ton of water (maybe too much) and it seemed as if after I peed enough the dizziness started to get better, but im not sure it could've just been a coincidence. 

The past 6 days I was probably drinking 5-6 liters of water a day and I was pissing a lot, but it was ok I thought, though now I'm thinking I will just stick to 2-2.5 liters a day so I pee less and hopefully it helps with the dizziness.

I‚Äôm just really anxious about the prospect of it getting worse. Anxiety was part of the reason I started kratom, and it‚Äôs clearly coming back in full force. I have had to resort to 1/4 of a 0.5mg tab of Ativan prescribed to me a long time ago 2 times in the past 6 days, and even then I‚Äôm afraid to take more because the ‚Äúheavy‚Äù feeling scares me though it does keep back the spiraling feedback loop of a panic attack. 

Sorry if this is poorly formatted or a run on I feel pretty out of it today, thank you for reading and wish you all the best in your quits.

I quit kratom 8 months ago after struggling so hard with the addiction for about 3 years.  I was so lost I can‚Äôt even remember it all.  At the highest I was taking 60 grams a day.

I had all the bags, all the different strains, rotating to keep tolerance low.  A dose at least every 3 hours, extra doses at night to sleep, doses for bad days, good days, and every day. 

Total hell.  I thought I had to have it.  I thought I could NEVER quit.  I thought I wasn‚Äôt capable of living without it.  I thought withdrawl would be too much for me psychologically and physically.

I‚Äôm here to tell you it was hard, it was hell.  I felt like hell for a very long time, probably six months.  Though it was always getting a little better during those months.

Yes, it starts to get better pretty quickly, it just takes time before you feel normal again.  You have to just stick that time out.  So do whatever you have to do to get through it.  I used a lot of delta 8, and and gave up on ‚Äúaccomplishments‚Äù in life.  Quitting kratom is the most important accomplishment!!! The other stuff will come with time.

Living my life now is so amazing.  So, so, so much better.  I can feel again.  I have a body.  I have emotions.  I can connect with others.

I promise you, I do not have some sort of privileged life that makes it this way.  I have all the same struggles we all have.

I‚Äôm so damn glad I quit kratom and I now have absolutely no desire to take it again for ANY reason.

Whatever stage of quitting you‚Äôre in, even if you‚Äôre just thinking about quitting, DONT GIVE UP.  Kratom is a total lie.  It convinces you that it‚Äôs giving you something good, all while totally destroying you.

Do whatever it takes to quit.  Yes, it‚Äôs hard, no arguing that.  But it‚Äôs SO worth it!!!

This sub was the KEY for me in quitting.  All the info here, all the shared experiences, good and bad.  All of its great.  If someone posts a ‚Äútragic‚Äù post, it HELPS because we can see how much suffering kratom actually causes.  Thank you to this sub, and everyone here.

My life is different now. Feel myself taking it back. I‚Äôm doing more for me, reconnecting with friends and re-learning the things I love doing. 

While I‚Äôm not 100% yet, I feel like I am winning more and more each day. I‚Äôm developing new habits, changing routine, caring less about shit I cannot change and focusing on the things I can. 

Talked to my therapist yesterday as we try to uncover the nature and triggers of my addiction. I didn‚Äôt think I suffered from anxiety. No feelings of nervousness, sweaty palms etc. but I do overthink everything! She told me that is a form of anxiety. Huh, didn‚Äôt know. With this knowledge I can change, get support where needed and start to work through it.

Love to all! Remember the only constant in life is change. Embra",5,0

I discovered Kratom while recruiting for the military. My drinking had become out of control. I was mean, angry, and absent. The alcohol had essentially destroyed my marriage and prevented me from enjoying my time at home. Kratom fixed all of this‚Ä¶ at least that‚Äôs what I thought and what I told everyone around me. I would give a long winded description of this ‚Äúmiracle plant from Southeast Asia, that was similar to coffee‚Äù , to anyone that inquired. It started off as a low cost, no negative side effect solution to a substance that was killing me in every way. 

Almost 4 years later and the marriage that I saved is in a worse place than it was then. Fortunately a job change and eventually the pandemic, allowed me to make better use of my time at home. But these positives slowly became more difficult to justify. I progressed from 6-7gpd of powder, to $600-$800 a month in extract. Not even the shame and embarrassment of getting caught maxing a credit card was enough to make me cut the cord, but now I‚Äôve made the conscious decision to eliminate this evil from my life.

I am an addicted to escaping my reality, and have been since 12-13 years old. Whether it‚Äôs nicotine, alcohol,adderall, podcasts, or documentaries I am always looking for the exit. 

My wife and I have begun both individual and couples counseling, and I‚Äôm dedicated to confronting whatever trauma damaged my brain. My dad died from his addiction, my brother somehow has come back to life the 4 times he went too far, and I refuse to go down that path.

I have come to grips with the fight that is in front of me, both in the immediate future and ongoing. But I‚Äôm done. Time to put my head down and move forward. 

Im sure I will be leaning heavily on what appears to be a great community. Let‚Äôs go!",30,1

Summary-I took biohazard green sludge for over 4+ years. Teaspoons, never measured until my rapid taper /ct jump. I was so uncomfortable w/ rapid taper and so tired of taking green sludge I just said f it! I jumped! I ct‚Äôd @ home with only a few xanax. I had no other assistance. No thc, no comfort meds. High dose vit c and vitamins carried me. I was hard to say the least. I had a medical detox on standby but I never went. My bloodwork came back excellent in month 2 of ct! Im in my 30s and female! 4+ years Ive eaten organic grassfed meats/ cheese, veggies, vit D., sauna 3-4 x‚Äôs a week, weightlifting, ice baths. Weekly sun exposure for Vit D. I also had a physical exam done@ a doc office, everything was normal. I had no heavy metal exposure. 

Acutes were awful, I had crazy chest pains, blood pressure spikes, weird phantom ‚Äúchest flutters‚Äù, alot of this persisted well after acutes flatlined. I lean towards defining paws as cyclical withdrawals, kratom is a nasty, longterm beast! My #1 worst wd symptom has been rls. The fatigue and brain fog were tied for #2 spot. The major fatigue, doom/gloom, anxiety, wild up/down moods has finally disappeared. Baseline? I hope so because I feel great mentally. My arch nemesis nightime rls has finally stopped for an all time record amount of time! This marks my longest consistent days + of no nighttime rls. Largest block of time consecutive w/o nightime rls since I began my ct at home! I hope you rot in hell kratom and rls! Lol. 
I do feel aches in my feet and hands/forearms during the day. Online research points to dopamine deficiency from wd‚Äôs/paws being the cause. I do get cold/hot hands/feet still, much less intense/often as before. Im so grateful the patterns have changed. Healing! I fought so hard and took it to the chin friends! 

Ill never forget binge reading every post here for months straight! We all think we messed ourselves up permanently!  Not the case! Healing from biohazard green sludge takes so much time! Cyclical up/down! This has been a wild, weird, exhausting, beautiful 140 days for me to say the least! 

The only statements I read that annoy me is ‚Äúkratom withdrawls this far out no way‚Äù Umm, yes thats facts! I am 100% sober and def feeling withdrawls/ paws still! The fact that other people can dismiss ones truth is bananas gaslighting. How this green sludge is marketed is beyond reckless. At this point though, thats water under the bridge. Hindsights always 20/20. Smh. But I digress. 

I am an x motorcycle racer, I also used to lift heavy @ the gym. I took kratom for a neck injury. Kratom didnt help with the pain, it created dependency and I cant believe I bought into the sales pitch ‚Äúits like coffee‚Äù. Yeah right! In 10 days Ill be 5 months off kratom, looking back kratom gave me anxiety and made me a shell of my former self! Ive gotten my neck pain down to 0‚Äôs with PRP/PPP injections. Highly recommend them friends if your in pain/can spend the $! 

This group, my nutrition,God and grit got me here. Thank you. Grateful, happy, healing, hopeful. Blessed, humbled and hungry for new life levels. I un-stuck myself in 3 major ways. Bye kratom, got my injury dialed in, became single too. I am at peace. Truly. 

My TOP 7 tips for the newcomers!!

*High dose Vit C (works for some not all) (acute wd‚Äôs)

*Youtube Mindfulness/ ruminating. Master how to be mindful and no ruminating! 

*How to search key words /older posts in group-Go to group mainpage. After where it says r/quittingkratom . Enter key search phrases like ‚Äúrls‚Äù, ‚Äúpaws‚Äù . Youll find great comfort in reading older posts. I have so many old posts bookmarked. 

*Organic nutrition! Hydrate too! Organic grass fed meats, veggies. Potassium (banana) alvocados for magnesium daily! Raw oysters for iodine, organic cacao in milk for copper! Salt, Vit D from the sun! Organic oranges/grapefruits, (most otc vit c is synthetic) I spend bank$ on foods. Dhea/fish oil + vit D 10k iu daily. 

*Work out! Force yourself! ** even during acutes while I was fully shaking like a madwoman, I worked out. Bananas to reflect back on wow! 

*Wim Hoff breathing in ice baths! Spikes dopamine 250+%! Amazing mental high! Wim Hoff breathing is a game changer! 

*Be kind to yourself. ‚ÄúI am withdrawing, this too shall pass‚Äù 

*ps, music is life! So is grounding in nature!

These tips really got me threw the kratom biohazard trenches! Thank you group! Im rooting for all of you! You can do it! 

Maybe Im close to outta the woods, maybe paws makes another cameo. Im ready no matter what. 

Namaste.",28,0

Like most, it's done a $ on my savings.  I made the decision that day to cut up my debit card.

Anytime I had enough money from doing favors for friends and what not I would always go by shots.

Which gets us to day before yesterday, I bought two shots after doing a favor. Probably the 6th day in a row I've used 2 shots but I still have more days off then on since June.

So I'm around 36 hours since that dose. I know this battle has become mental for me.  I'm not suffering physically but mentally this shit got me. I almost went and bought some hydros thinking well he'll, atleast it's not kratom.  I didn't buy the hydros.

Guess this is for me to update daily to try to hold myself accountable.  I'm going to be posting on the thread whenever I have shitty thoughts.

Sorry for the long read but I need all the support/accountability I can get.

I should add I'm taking vit c and get regular excersise.

And use thc regularly.

It also boils down to what I do to when I have $50 tomorrow.  I don't want to buy it but I've been on automatic mode before and had a couple days and went straight to the store after making some money.

I‚Äôm a junkie at heart. I love being high. I love deciding how I want to feel and life‚Äôs pressures are so heavy that i use to cope. It‚Äôs always been my dirty little secret (as if no one could tell, but they could). 

I‚Äôve been to multiple rehabs for opiates. My last stint at a rehab, the shrink prescribed me gabapentin. I stayed on that for 2 years and stayed clean. Recently, I got cut off. All those old urges came back and before I knew it I was buying percs off the street. I weaned down the Percocet to 5mg and couldn‚Äôt take it so I bought some kratom. I have a past with kratom and know what it‚Äôs gonna do to me. I was on it for a year. The hair loss, the stomach issues, looking like death. I don‚Äôt want to stay on this long.  

Im on about 9 gram daily and been off the opiates for 4 days. So basically on kratom almost 5 days. I wake up sick to my stomach with chills and take 3 grams to ease that. 

Basically, I want to be fully clean and I don‚Äôt have time to be sick. Any advice on how long to stay on this and how to get off painlessly. I‚Äôm so sick of kicking drugs. I‚Äôm disgusted with myself. 

I have an appointment with a new doctor this Monday and I‚Äôm going to ask for gabapentin. That seems to keep me clean off all other drugs.

Just want to share some of my experiences with you in hopes that it could help someone else. Things are going well for me so far. I have had a kratom habit of roughly 60-80 gpd for 2.5 years (often probably more, even up to 100 gpd, I never kept count until lately but based on my estimations I was taking way more than I thought I was). Most of the time I took powder and ate spoonfuls, large ones, and washed it down with water. I weighed it one time. One dose of what I thought was maybe 5-8 g was actually 16g. I took alot, usually dosing 4-8 times perday. I started thinking about quitting a year ago when I found out, via the internet, how harmful it actually is to the liver and other body parts. Plus it was starting to have more negative effects on my life like nausea, tiredness, grouchiness, lack of libido, etc.

I tried quitting CT three times last week. I was very surprised at how severe my withdrawal symptoms were. First and second tries made it about 18-20 hours, Third try I made it almost 40 hours before giving in. I decided to try tapering and so far so good. I got capsules (easy to track how much I take. Each cap is 0.55 grams), and have been bagging them out into exact doses and only taking with me what I allow myself too (sometimes its been tempting to take more but I'm doing okay at it). I managed to cut my dose down to only 35 grams yesterday and today I'm aiming for the same. The best part is that even at such a drastically reduced dose I am so far keeping the WD mostly at bay. The mild ones start before I take the next dose usually but it is really not that bad at all so far. I'm going to stick with this for 7 days and then cut it down even more. One thing I've found very helpful is journaling about it. I keep a detailed log of each time of day I take it and exactly how much I took. Seeing these hard data on paper helps me to plan and organize it. I have to say that this group has given me many great ideas and I have found it very very helpful. So I thank you all for your help.

I was taking kratom for productivity, but in hindsight I believe after being desensitized to it i was less productive, and it encouraged a few other bad habits. 
Since quitting, I haven't had bad withdrawal symptoms outside of the stomach problems and temperature sensitivity. 
Funny thing is, about three months ago I ran out but didn't think anything of it, went to work and the withdrawal symptoms were terrible. I had them all, so I went back to kratom. This is weird, but I'm really grateful to be independent of it again, I'm seeing a more positive future for myself, and saving a lot of money on the bad habits I kicked!

Today, I feel pretty close to normal. The last two weeks have flown right by. The first week felt like a year. I am approaching the one month mark and I am so relieved I made the decision to quit.

The acute symptoms are long gone. Sleep is still not great but I always had sleep problems, this is my normal. Mood swings are better - I still get easily emotional but that‚Äôs normal when life gets challenging. 

For those worried about cravings - I haven‚Äôt had any. I think a lot of the people struggling with cravings are the ones that used kratom as a coping strategy for loneliness and dissatisfaction with life. I used it to help with energy, focus and anxiety. All of those things are manageable. If you have a strong support system of friends, family, a partner, you‚Äôll be okay. If you have hobbies and passions that enrich your life, you‚Äôll be okay. If you don‚Äôt have these things, take this time to find them. Make a list of things you wanted to try and do them even for 30 minutes at a time if you‚Äôre mid-quit. If you‚Äôre planning on quitting, make the list now, gather the supplies - this is your ammunition against PAWS. Sitting around on the couch or in bed during your spare time will make the process harder. 

Boredom persists but I keep myself occupied. I‚Äôve always had a problem with boredom unless I was experiencing hyperfocus (I suspect I have undiagnosed ADHD - seeing my gp about it finally). I had anhedonia around week 2 and 3 and I was worried about it lasting months but I think I am out of that phase already. I experienced the pink cloud once my acutes got better. When it was gone I missed it, but I am comfortable with how I feel now. The pink cloud felt like being manic while having no energy to do anything thanks to the acutes/lethargy. I realized the pink cloud did nothing for me aside from reminding me of all the ways in which my life is good. I can do that on my own with a gratitude journal. 

Some of you managed to get hard workouts in during the first week, whereas I could barely walk around the block. I can now walk 10-13k steps and not feel like I am dying. Being able to be physically active again without kratom giving me fake energy feels amazing. 

The posts on here are incredibly helpful. However, I found myself focusing on the negative aspects of some of the experiences here. It made me ruminate and worry about the timeline of my recovery. At around the two week mark I made the decision to browse this subreddit less. I still check here occasionally because I like to see people‚Äôs inspiring posts and I‚Äôm in a place where reading about other members‚Äô struggles doesn‚Äôt give me anxiety about my own journey. For me it‚Äôs been about finding a balance - getting support when I need it but not letting myself get bogged down. 

Actually, this whole process has taught me balance - paying the debt via withdrawals, finding a new daily routine without kratom, understanding that emotions can be difficult but beautiful. It‚Äôs also taught me to be comfortable with myself and my life in the moment - to accept the good and the bad, and to keep moving forward. Life isn‚Äôt supposed to be easy, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt be beautiful. 

To everyone who quit - congratulations. This is peak self care, and I am proud of you. To everyone considering quitting - it‚Äôs going to be difficult but never beyond what you can handle (no matter what your brain tells you). If I can do it, you can too.",12,0

As my sobriety continues I am becoming more aware of who I am and why I use Kratom or any substance. I stole HALT from another organization and it‚Äôs helped me understand my triggers. 

I‚Äôve always managed success despite my high alcohol use turn kratom addiction. I have an amazing life with two beautiful, smart and successful teenagers. My wife is simply incredible, gorgeous on the inside and out on her worst day. I am extremely blessed! So why do I reach for substances? What is it I am lacking? Not sure yet, but plan to find out! 

What I do know is anytime I‚Äôm feeling lonely (which is often these days working from home in covid) I want an escape a substance to numb the sadness. When I‚Äôm tired it accelerates the negativity. When I‚Äôm hungry I just turn into an asshole, angry and Kratom took that away as well‚Ä¶ until it didn‚Äôt. 

Now when I feel one of these HALT triggers I sit with it. I become aware of my inner state, pray, meditate and find it goes away. I can see and feel my inner child addict brain trying to convince me that kratom will take it all away. I smile back now at that voice. Every time I bring awareness to it‚Ä¶. It diminishes a little more each day.

I‚Äôve had some severe mental complications from prescribed meds earlier last year with lots of panic attacks, anxiety and insomnia. I got my life back on track doing rigoureus exercise, healthy living, cold shock therapy and breathing. But anxiety attacks still flaired up from time to time just before noon so I started experimenting with herbal supps and got into kratom.

My dosage was always very low. Just 1-2g was enough to completely halt my anxiety for the rest of the day. I suspect I was merely masking away the anxiety as over the next 6 months I started getting frequent night terrors and anxiety attacks at night. 

I gradually upped my kratom to cope up until I dosed around 5g a day. Recently the anxiety has become unbearable and if I‚Äôm not having nightmare fueled sleep for a few hours at a time I‚Äôm mostly lying awake with depressive thoughts and racing mind. 

What made the trigger for me to start questioning kratom was that my anxiety has slowly transitioned into a different form as I was used to. It used to be a very acute sort of anxiety, with lots of stomach quenching and butterflies around the heart area. Now its more like a very drawn out restless anxiety with depression and feelings of being trapped in a nightmare and heart racing.

I‚Äôm sort of confused right now. I can‚Äôt tell if my anxiety disorder has become worse on its own or if the kratom has taken it‚Äôs toll despite the low dosage.

I‚Äôm taking the safe route out now and just plain quitting, embracing the succ for the next few weeks to see if things develop for the better.

Some insight would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks, and soldier on.",4,1

I usually took it at night and that put me in a good mood for the following day.

I cannot seem to get past the withdrawal symptoms and cravings. I‚Äôve had a mountain of stressors including getting married, having our first child, my wife and I both contracted COVID (I‚Äôm vax, she‚Äôs not as she was pregnant. I also will not entertain COVID discussion on this thread), moving- TWICE in 3 months, losing one job and starting another. I‚Äôve been through it this year. All while making my rollercoaster ride of trying to quit this shit, seem further and further from becoming possible. 

I‚Äôve become extremely depressed, full of anxiety and terribly ill-tempered in general and specifically towards my wife, especially if I am in a position where I cannot have access to K. She does not know of my habit, and while I understand that being deceitful is adding mounted stress on top of it, she can not and will not know about it. My marriage will be over. She still believes I kicked the habit 2 years ago. I honestly have no idea how I have managed to get by this long but enough is enough. I want to get clean and sober for my son and for my wife. More importantly, for myself. 

This sub has become my outlet. I read and read and read. I am able to take some sort of comfort in reading about so much success and struggle and everything in between. I know I am not alone. 

I have chalked my anger issues up to getting it from my dad as he was an angry person my entire childhood. His, like mine, was fueled by his addiction to alcohol. Mine- Kratom. Fortunately my Dad is 7 years sober now. If he can beat addiction, so can I. However I have proven to myself that I am incapable of doing so and have taken the step to seek help. I have an appointment with a Depression and Addiction psychiatrist next Tuesday. I considered Psychotherapy, but frankly, I‚Äôm past talking about my issues and I need medical assistance. 

TLDR: I‚Äôm seeking psychiatric help. I am also seeking advice on anything I should specifically discuss with the doctor in order to aid in my quit. Does anyone know of any medication that I should question or specifically express interest in? Does something work better than others? Has something helped you? Is there any medication they may recommend that you think I should avoid? I‚Äôve read and tried about every single OTC method, to no avail. I understand there are certain medications that are dangerous and can lead to a cross addiction, which I seek to avoid. 

At this point I‚Äôll open it up to you. I hope this thread and the comments to come will not only help myself, but possibly someone else or others that may be in a similar situation as I.

Last night I was coming up on three weeks, so I decided I had taken the gabapentin for long enough. Didn't take any last night. Slept about as okay as I have been (not horribly, not great). Feeling a little rougher around the edges this morning than I have for a week or so. I mean, I still feel so much better than I did my first week. Been about a day and a half since I took that last 300mg.

Wondering if I took that gabapentin for a bit too long. Or, was that 300mg at night really doing a great job of suppressing my remaining Kratom WD symptoms?

Hopefully, doing this taper will help me once I jump CT. Even if it only saves me one day of accute wd, it's worth doing this taper, because I know how brutal CT will be.

Day 1-4: hardest days physically and mentally but doable. 
Day 5-8: rampant improvement. Able to work, take care of all responsibilities, workout etc. 
Day 9-11: slight improvement, but the high of quitting was wearing off. I started to feel down. Sweating, hot/cold flashes were all gone. Sleeping pretty much back to normal. Slightly lethargic and little interest in anything
Day 12-15: day 12 I got angry. Ordered some kava and did some delta 8. Didn‚Äôt help, huge fight with wife. Very irritable.
Day 16: lazy day, slow at work. Forcing myself to workout. Able to do what I need to but nothing special. Took delta 8 in afternoon, talked to a great friend and felt better. Actually had a nice night. Fell asleep at 9 and woke up at 5am! 
Day 17: just started, feels promising! Still taking it easy. Boredom is a problem so I plan to get outside, change it up. Maybe go shopping or something in between work. 

The kratom quit is so odd as so many people have stated. Ups and downs. The trick is to ride the waves. Be honest with where you are at and communicate it. That said, it doesn‚Äôt and won‚Äôt kill you. The 1-3 months of adjustment is well worth the lifetime of abstinence. 

Last- the world is a mess. America is a disaster. Kratom numbed this. Now I‚Äôm no longer numb and I feel the weight of all this. It‚Äôs normal, and something we should feel in hopes the make change. 

Double last: can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm on day 17! It‚Äôs actually gone by fairly quick. I‚Äôve rounded the 1/2 way point to a month which will also happen quickly.

I have a GF of almost 7 years that also wants me to stop badly. I feel like in the past year so much has happened to my body that I cannot explain and no health insurance and low on $ so going to doctor isn't going to happen for a while but I got this strange pain in my head that wasnt like a usual headache. Dull ache ya know? It comes and goes very randomly. Ill go a month without it sometimes more but it always comes back has been persistent lately. I have always been worried about brain tumors but I am only 27 years old its possible but so unlikely. Recently I have been having odd pains in my right lung near center of chest and for the past 2 months ive had a weird sensation in my bladder, at first I thought it was a kidney stone because I have gotten them before but the constant urge to pee just wasn't as intense as when I really had a stone in me. It has gone from urge to pee to a feeling like there is something prickly in my tract so who knows but 2 months it should have passed well before now. I feel like now I have major health anxiety, issues with rage especially when I am gaming. I sit around a LOT. I am literally always tired no matter how much sleep I get but here I am off of it for one day now and I still have those pains we talked about but I hope over time they will go away. I eat pretty healthy vegetarian diet and drink lots of water used to be awful 3 to 5 sodas a day sometimes I still sit around a lot because it is what I like to do but this is not going to be an easy ride for me. I miss the magical feeling of when I first got into it I felt like I was so outgoing and everytime I took it it ignited a spark in me where I let my guard down now no matter how much I take it never comes back I am always this mopey,angry boring shell of a person that has major problems I dont know if I can ever recover or get fixed from, maybe its too late? I hope not. I used to love my life so much and now I feel like time is ticking and who knows how much longer ill be here until I die from the way I have treated my body in the past.

How should I taper, how fast/slow do you guys think I should taper to best avoid withdrawals? I know they are inevitable but I would like to minimize them.

The odd part is I feel lonely but when I‚Äôm around people I have to force myself to interact. Fake it till you make it. I‚Äôll do whatever it takes. Still feels like I‚Äôm hiding how I feel. Wife is fine talking about it. Not fair to lean on her. 
Good news: after all of that I still resisted the urge to buy kratom! I am so proud of that. I stay encouraged by people posting 30 days is when they start to feel normal ish. The ups and downs are crazy. I‚Äôll ride them out. 

Fuck off kratom‚Ä¶.. not today! ‚Ä¶.. not today!!",17,0

Today I will be beginning a new taper.

I‚Äôve been taking kratom for 3 and a half, maybe 4 years daily now. I take between 20-30g a day depending on the day. I‚Äôve tried quitting many times but the issue is the taper. Cold turkey ive only been able to make it two or three days. About 2 months ago I tapered down from 30g to taking 10-15g a day for about 2-3 weeks. But the issue was after that I couldn‚Äôt get passed to the next step.

Lowering my dose isn‚Äôt too hard for me but lowering the frequency is what kills me and makes me fall off every time and it pains me to not be mentally tough enough to stick to it. My issue is, I feel anxious and serious WD In the morning. So I dose maybe 2-3 hours after waking up to try and hold off during my taper. Then I‚Äôll take 2g as maintenance later then an night time dose. Any advice on cutting out the night time dose? I cannot sleep without it.

Also, if I taper slowly for about a month will I still feel WD when I get to the cold turkey part if I can get my taper down to 2-3g a day?

Thanks everyone. Today‚Äôs a new chapter. Tapering begins. I refuse to fall

Just for today I am clean, and I will do this one day at a time.

A month ago I got out of around a 70 day stint in rehab. I came off benzos, amps, opioids, alcohol, marijuana, and kratom. It was a hard ride, but the most amazing experience of my entire life. I will never forget some of memories that were made with the people there and all the ups and downs. 

I checked in May 28th, went through detox and quick tapers, residential, PHP and I've been clean ever since. But not really.. The one thing I could not resist was the KRATOM. About 60 days in while I was in the PHP Program, I bought a kratom shot. PHP for those who don't know is the step before IOP and halfway housing. I got my phone and my credit cards back and even had nightmare drug dreams about using kratom. I was still getting drug tested, breath tested, and going to group for 7 hours a day. I was set and thought everything was over and I was good.

One day I woke up and I bought an OPMS shot without even thinking about it. My mind did a 180. My diseased mind rationalized and justified using it for me. ""Just once"" or ""won't show up on drug test.""

Here I am after being home for a month and still using kratom up until yesterday. It started slow as a just once thing and then just weekends. You all know how this story goes.

I was living a lie and even attending NA meetings to show my family I was doing good.

Right after I started the kratom again people started saying that I looked very tired and that I didn't seem like myself. I thought I felt good.. And it was so crazy how people noticed something was different. Although they were used to seeing me clean everyday. 

When I'm in active addiction I lie, when Im sober I do so much better with my honesty and gratitude.

I went through some crazy withdrawals that put me in the hospital when I was in rehab (benzos). I had seizures and the whole 9. I'm still experiencing movement problems.

I was scared to wake up this morning, but by the grace of my higher power I am not going through too much withdrawal. Just some fatigue, apathy, boredom, and a runny nose. 

I know I only used again for a month, but I was up to 2-3 shots plus  5-10 grams of capsules a day for at least two weeks straight. I built up to that really quick and my tolerance got back up to where it was fast. I am so lucky I'm not multiple months or years into this usage or else I would be in big trouble, as I've experienced horrendous kratom withdrawal before. Psychosis, severe illness, couldn't get comfortable, hot and cold sweats, thinking I was going to die, panic attacks, etc.

If you're clean today GIVE THANKS!!!
One day at a time.

Wow, I am blown away once again regarding how much this drug had a hold on me since I relapsed on it back in April.  I have spent the last 8 days going through hell. I got down to 2.5 grams before I finally quit, and hoped it wouldn't be that bad. Yep, for me it was still bad.

However, I also relapsed on alcohol in April. The past two years prior, I had been sober from alcohol and just using kratom.  This time, alcohol made the withdrawal/detox so much worse.  But it was the only way I felt I could get through it, and I'm just grateful I am finally free of it.

Anyhow, I just wanted to give an update and wish you all the best in your quitting kratom journey's.

I have been a lurker on reddit for years and years(non kratom related threads), and I never had the urge to make an account and reach out for anything. **HOWEVER...** This terrible addiction of mine has finally made me want to make an account and reach out for help from others. This is my first post EVER.

A little back story about me - 

I am a 25 year old male that has always had an addictive personality, for the good, and unfortunately for the bad. For the good meaning - if I find something interesting, I will research the living hell out of it. Live, breath, and sleep it. I could use this addictive personality as a superpower for all the ""productive"" things in life such as starting a business and becoming OBSESSIVE over it. Unfortunately, as of right now it is ""for the bad"". I don't have control over this addictive trait of mine, it has control over me. I need help. I can't do this alone, and I have nobody to turn to, because they just won't understand where I am coming from. I am in tears as I write this, because for the first time in years it feels like I am venting my pain. I know I am capable of amazing things in life, but this kratom addiction is holding me back. I first started taking kratom out of curiosity. The first time trying it sold me instantly. I felt like a got damn genius. I felt like I could conquer the world. I was funnier, sharper, more confident, and overall felt like I was on a level of being on the limitless pill. I felt alive and didn't want to experience life without it. At first I did not think it would be a problem, but after 2 years, it's safe to say its a HUGE problem in my life. I don't measure how much I take, I just do a big ole scoop in my coffee/tea 3-4 times per day. I'm guessing it's about 30 gpd give or take. Once in the morning to get rid of my zombie brain, another after lunch to keep myself on a roll, and another around 6pm to help me focus on homework/my business I am trying to start. **Without kratom I am unmotivated**. That is the biggest reason I take it - it makes me happy, and it makes me want to be productive. I just want to be normal again. I don't want to have to sneak in my doses throughout the day anymore. My girlfriend has no idea. I mean, NO idea. I want to wake up and start my day without my first action reaching in my secret stash. I have decided I wanted to quit for a few reasons: I don't want to waste anymore money on this, I am slowly but surely needing more and more everyday and this WILL spiral out of control if I don't take action now, I feel like it has made my memory/overall cognition worse (I hope this isn't permanent damage), and it has control over me to the point where I need it to feel normal. I want to taper and was looking for all the support/guidance I can get. I want to taper over a 1 month period, the 31st day being my last day I take it.

Also, don't get hooked on something else trying to get off this crap. I scared the crap outta myself trying to use phenibut to help with sleeplessness. Just don't do it. Go checkout the quitting sub for them if you need a few reasons not to use it.

Good luck, yall!",6,0

I have suffered from depression, severe social anxiety, general anxiety, fear, and feeling of impending doom since I was a pre-teen. After going through difficult times I started to drink, and drink, and drink. It just further shrouded me in darkness, and severely affected my physical and mental health. 

I own and operate a smoke shop, and decided to try my own product one day  after hearing from people how amazing Kratom was. I can say that yes, it was amazing. All of that darkness, fear, anxiety, and depression  was suddenly gone. I'd never felt that feeling, of positive utter happiness, energy, and motivation.

Fast forward almost 2 years, and I no longer ever have that feeling when using Kratom. I now take it to avoid the withdrawal. Anxiety, severe depression. I ride on Kratom's ceiling now, and it's impenetrable. Take too much at a time, and you get sick. It's got me exactly where it wants me. I started to feel constant irritation, nervous twitching, and anxiety which I have never felt. Anxiety attacks, physically crippling me, and I could swear I was going to have a heart attack and die at work. This happened for a week until I went to the ER for tests. I'm healthy as can be, nothing odd. I realized I needed to be strong and kick this shit.

I'm 9 days into my journey today, cold turkey. It's been utter hell for me. Alcohol withdrawal is bad, but this is worse. I swear, once I get completely through this.... I'm turning my life around. My happiness shouldn't ever come from an addiction. I'm ashamed of myself, but also proud of my strength.

We will get through this, with sheer willpower and determination. I'm thankful for this group, as it has helped me these past few days. Bless up, and keep going, minute by minute, hour by hour, day by day. We got this.",35,0

Most of my posts have been mostly ranting about how long it's taking me to get some recovery. My anxiety in quitting before doing so seem to always revolve solely around the acute withdrawals. They were definitely difficult. When those finally weakened, I had a slight peroid or relief. I thought the worst was over. It wasn't. By far, the worst thing I've had to face in my recovery has been the fatigue. To the point where my body just always felt like I was moving through jello or mud. I would get out of breath very easily and just had no motivation to do anything. Sounds worse than it actually was. 

So why was it the worst thing, you ask? The duration. I'm just now starting to get back to my normal physical self. In spite of hearing several people here say it would eventually get better, the fact I wasn't seeing any improvement and felt frozen in my state was very concerning. 

Well, it's been three months and I can say it's definitely starting to improve. I'm also seeing improvements in ways I wasn't expecting. My general mood and patience has dramatically improved with other people. I'm a better, more active father.

Seems like the 3 month mark for me is the moment I can see the improvement I needed to see to gain motivation and second wind to keep going. To keep making better improvements and developing healthy habits. If I had to guess, I'm probably at about 80 percent of where my baseline is. Maybe less. Time will tell. Even if this is my baseline currently, it's still far better than where I was at during my daily use.

I never thought I would post but reading all the posts really encouraged me my first 7-10 days so I decided to share. From the beginning, I knew I was done whatever the cost. I had my mind on my side. I knew K had changed my personality into a negative, foggy minded human that just made it through each day. Looking back I see how lifeless I had become and felt. I once got addicted to tramadol by accident (because at that time it wasn‚Äôt even a scheduled substance) and quitting K reminded me a lot of quitting that, only tramadol was about 10x worse. They both affect opioid receptors and serotonin reuptake.

Day 1 - 6: I didn‚Äôt sleep at all. Even though I knew to expect it, it was still hard. I had the anxiety, restless leg, fatigue, and general discomfort. Not sleeping and the anxiety was by far the worst, but I kept telling myself eventually my body would have to sleep.

Day 7: I slept 4 hours. I was still very tired and lethargic.

Day 8-9: I barely slept, I was still exhausted most of the day. 

Day 10: The world got better! I slept 6 hours. I started feeling a little more energetic. 

Day 12: I quit counting the days. I sleep good now. 

I exercised and still do just about every day. My body would scream ‚Äúno!‚Äù but I would make myself anyways and felt amazing after. Go exercise if you do nothing else. Start you day with it. Say only 15 minutes and do it.

The first three days I was off of work but I had to work the remainder of the time. It was really tough but it did take my mind off of things. Mornings are really hard but by the afternoon I would be feeling much better.

Pray. God will bring you through anything you ask. 

The only person that knew I took K or quit K was my spouse but he was the only support I needed. 

If you failed once, then try again and again and again‚Ä¶.until you get it. You can do it! Everything is bright again. I‚Äôm engaged with my kids again. Things are HAPPY! I actually have and feel my emotions again. It felt like a LONG two weeks and it was. I am sure that I‚Äôm not out of the woods yet with PAWS, but I am glad that I am where I am today. I know everybody‚Äôs journey is different but if this can provide anybody a little bit of encouragement to stick it out for a few weeks it will get better. My story is not a lot different than everybody else‚Äôs and it comes down to being determined, having a support system, and finding your own personal path through recovery because we are all different.

This year had been the worst in terms of kratom that I've had yet. I spent there first couple years under a 15gpd habit, the 3rd year got up to about 25gpd, but I got it under control for a little while and got back down to 15gpd. Shit, at one point in my 2nd year, I got all the way down to 4gpd and boy do I wish I was able to kick it then.
I'm now up to 60+ grams per day, and I've never felt worse physically or mentally. But when I had my epiphany, I realized that I would never get off of this shit if I didn't get help. So I told my mom this morning what was going on, and I told her I will be putting myself in rehab as soon as my work season is completed. I actually felt quite a bit of relief once I told her. I tried tapering so many times, and I decided that I just wanted to quickest way to get over it. I know it will be a hell of a lot more painful, but I also know that the drawn out schedule of tapering is actually more suffering in my opinion, when you think about all the time you spend goin in and out of withdrawal.
I hope this post can encourage another brave soul to make the jump. I read another post from someone who is 30 days clean from a 60-80gpd habit, and that also helped ease my mind a bit.

617,2021-09-04 19:09:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/pi1qw6/complacency/,Complacency,"Hi guys and gals, 

I'm not much of a poster, but a commenter here. I just recenly celebrated 7 months off Kratom, but I still think (obsess) about it every day. I still very much need this sub and all the support I find here. Quitting Kratom has been a very hard, very drawn process for me. Third and final quit from 16-30 gpd for 2-3 years. I was a saturated polluted bonafide Kratom zombie. A slave to the powder. I still am certainly, but no longer consume it.

I switched gears, and won't go to the vape shop where I used to buy it. My new shop doesn't sell Kratom, so in no way am I triggered when I re-up my juice. I recently went to visit my kiddo in a town ""next door"" and realized I was out of juice, so we found the local shop. I wasn't thinking at all about Kratom, and my guard was completely down.

I walked into the door and the first thing I see on the entire front wall was...yeah. An entire ""pick your poison"" type of display. ""We have reds, whites, greens, and our new YELLOWS!"" Try this for anxiety, this for pain, this for energy...rah rah rah. I was floored and speechless. This was not a ""vape"" shop. This was a Kratom store.  I stood there staring with my jaw on the floor, when the doofus shop clerk walked up and asked, ""what can I get you.""

I slowly turned to him (looking all stupid) and said, ""Man, It's ALL I've got in me to recover from this.""
I stood there watching his eyes, as he shifted uncomfortably. I could tell he was thinking, ""why are you even here?"" I quickly gathered myself up and picked a puff bar with all speed and haste. I practically fled the store.

I was reading through your stories today, and felt a need to post this. So many people place timelines on themselves. ""I should be out of wd in 2 weeks."" 
""I should be back to normal in 3 months."" 
There is truth to this yes, but what about your end game? What happens after the initial battle? What is the plan when you do reach you target timeline? In truth, preparations need to be put in place to prevent future relapse. I got complacent, and almost got nailed for it. Yellows? Never tried that one... Run.fast.

Guys, quitting kratom is hard. Wds are HARD. PAWS is even harder. This is a fight. This fight does not end when you achieve you target timeline. It is essential to set goals in recovery. What I'm saying, is don't invest to much time thinking about when you will feel better, or when you will get back to baseline. Your fight extends far past that. Not days, not weeks, or even months. We are talking years folks... as in forever years. 

I want to thank everyone here for sharing your stories and experiences.  Your stories empower me to stay quit. Just remember these things for your end game. You quit Kratom. Kratom did NOT quit you. You will get caught off guard. Develop ""emergency procedures"" when this happends. Prepare yourself with a solid action plan. I'm hard as stone in this quit, but that encounter brought me to my knees. Oh and if all else goes out the window... Run.fast

Thank you guys for reading, and huge congratulations on quiting Kratom!

Physically feeling alright except typical digestive issues, and still body temp regulation is off (always sweating so much!) but that's to be expected. Gabapentin usually helps with the body temp regulation issues but I'm tapering off that, and planning to only take it right before bed tonight. Planning on taking my doggo to the dog park later, and do some cleaning. I've been re-discovering my love of reading (Witcher!) and music. For all of you out there still early on, it does get better! Please stay strong. I feel like I've come out on the other side and am finally starting to feel like myself again. 

I've also been dialing in my naltrexone regimen.....Obligatory warning: Before experimenting with Naltrexone please do tons of research and/or work with a doctor. Taking it too soon can cause horrific precipitated withdrawal.   
I started taking a low dose of Naltrexone on Day 6. I noticed on days when I took higher doses (up to 12mg throughout the day) I had wicked insomnia. When I back the dose down to 2mg only in the morning, I slept fine. I had been planning to get the Vivitrol shot soon but the insomnia of course concerns me. I spoke with my Doctor, and addiction specialist (so lucky to have such great healthcare in my area, and covered by insurance). We talked through my exp and he agreed that especially with a new job starting in a little over the week the shot might be too much, and he will look into getting me a proper rx for LDN (interesting fact: in the US at least, you have to go through special compounding pharmacies for LDN/ULDN, and typically not covered by insurance but still much cheaper than the shot). He did say that the insomnia could simply just be an effect of my body still adjusting to the naltrexone and might subside in a few days, so advised trying 1/4 dose (\~12.5 mg) in the am. I took that amount yesterday, felt weird in the head all day like my brain was buzzing, and weirdly had intense cravings all day. I did sleep fine however I also had a bottle of wine, which was probably a bad idea. This morning took another 12.5mg, feel less weird in the head so far and will report back.

My personal tip: load your Netflix with as much comedy as possible - a good laugh will pull you right of the moment as a reprieve and splash your brain with everything you're craving for.

The first one was for a few months a year in but i started drinking heavily and used kratom to avoid drinking, then I finally got off of it after a 3 year 30+gpd habit. I was mostly sober for about a month, just smoking weed. Then i drank on new years and realized i can drink again without feeling like death, and the spiral started and I was drinking daily/ in the morning within a month. 8 months in i stopped drinking, and ofc 2 weeks in i think its an ok choice to try kratom again, just to see what it feels like. Within a week i was back at 30gpd. Used for 2.5ish months with a week break in between

&#x200B;

Suprisingly this time i didnt have any bad physical withdrawals, as i did the first time i quit for a week. But the anxiety and anhedonia are real. I keep listening to motivational stuff and trying to do as much as i can, because i realize that the reason i love alcohol and kratom is because i can sip a drink for hours after work and then just smoke a joint and pass out.

Im also definitely lonely, as im staying in my shitty hometown i had to move back to because of covid and unemployment and severe kratom addiction and lack of motivation to live. Kratom made me suicidal, which i had never been before.

I know im just rambling but i just had to clear my mind, I really wish the best to all of you.

On Aug 17 I started taper. 3.6g 4x a day, then 3.3g 4x. Then 3g 4x ( I dropped every 2-3 days) On Aug 27th, I took 3g at 4:30am and decided to see how long I could go. Made it until 12:30 that night!

Only major WD had been bad sleep and some anxiety , but last night slept like a baby! Just got back from 4 day vacation with family and had the BEST TIME!! Didn‚Äôt have to worry about taking ANY during the day! This drop and spacing out has been a gift! Now I will slowly drop the 3g down every few days starting tomorrow. It is the best feeling to go the entire day just living and enjoying life. I know I will have some so-so days ahead but what I just accomplished has given me my life back. I played a round of golf, played with kids on beach, and long nights on boardwalk. If your scared of CT but want to start beating Kratom, maybe try this taper method.

Any suggestions here would be much appreciated, what supplements should I be taking to help myself? Should I talk to a doctor about prescriptions that could help? I don‚Äôt want to develop a new dependency with prescription meds though. Any help or advice would be great.

I‚Äôm completely addicted to K shots. I have been taking 5-7 a day for the last few months. Needless to say I‚Äôm spending every penny I have on the stuff. 

I work a demanding job as a consultant and always used K to work a lot of hours. It‚Äôs at a point where the K shots don‚Äôt even give me a boost anymore. I just take them to satisfy a craving and not going into withdrawal. 

The last couple days I managed to take closer to 4 shots a day, and I started going into slight withdrawal. I drank a lot of alcohol, smoked a lot of pot, and binge ate ice cream and snacks the last couple days to deal with the withdrawal. 

Last night, I woke up to what felt like a heart attack. My hands and feet would go numb and felt tingly. I would lose consciousness and vision slightly, too. It felt like my heart wasn‚Äôt pumping enough blood and oxygen to my limbs. I could also have been experiencing some sort of panic attack. I called 911 but eventually told them I‚Äôm okay and not to send anyone. Im seeing my primary care doctor on Wednesday. The last time I saw her a few months ago, my cholesterol was really high and my oxygen levels in my blood were low enough to qualify as anemic. Never once had these issues off K. 

I have noticed I have been sleeping a lot more in recent days. I legit feel like these K shots are slowing breaking down my body. I‚Äôm only 30. My body shouldn‚Äôt be in this bad of shape. I‚Äôm not really even that fat. I weigh close to 165-170 now and am 5‚Äô9. Also, no matter how many times I run, I haven‚Äôt been able to get my average mile time below 12 minutes a mile. I‚Äôll run nearly every day for a month + and I make virtually no improvement. I never was this slow before the K.

All of this feels like a very very minor version of a previous withdrawal I had with another substance. In that case there was a week of acutes and then I had a 2 week period where I was recalibrating and I‚Äôd be randomly super happy for a day followed by depressed. Then I had 3-4 months of PAWS where focus and motivation were very very low.

I will address how to taper once I get stable on switching to powder.  I have never taken powered kratom.  I have seen it behind the counter in the health food store where I buy my kratom liquid.

I have a couple of questions regarding ultra-low-dose and low-dose naltrexone (and how it might help me kick kratom):

* Am I correct in understanding that ULDN can facilitate a quicker, more-comfortable taper? If I'm taking \~12g kratom/day, what kind of taper/ULDN schedule would I be looking at?

&#x200B;

* Folks consistently say that you can't take LDN until you're fully detoxed (maybe day 7 or so?) due to precipitated WD risk. So, if you use ULDN to taper down, does that mean you have to stop naltrexone completely on Day 1? Or can you maintain the ULDN schedule and very subtly titrate up to an LDN-level dosage by Day 7? Given that you can use ULDN while *on* kratom, it seems like you could use it after you've jumped. But I may be misunderstanding the mechanism. It would be awesome if ULDN could mitigate the discomfort of detox.

&#x200B;

* Based on the answers above, what would the dosing schedule look like for ULDN-to-LDN during the taper-detox-day 7 phases? Using Day 7 as a generality here of course.

Thanks so much for your help. I'm really excited to have found a tool like ULDN/LDN that can facilitate a change for the better. It's long-overdue for me. I appreciate the hard work that I'll need to put in during the process as well, so not expecting LDN to be a panacea. I appreciate your time!",2,0

When I first quit, 3 months seemed like a really long time, and I‚Äôve definitely come a long way, but it still feels like I‚Äôm very early in recovery. At 3 months, all of the horrible physical and mental aspects of quitting have gone away. Looking back on the first month, I can‚Äôt remember a darker time in my life, but all that has faded now. I feel like I felt before I ever even heard of kratom, which I wasn‚Äôt sure would ever happen. 

Now I‚Äôm thinking about how to stay off long term. I started taking it in the first place because life and work can be a slog, and it gave me good feelings and energy to tackle things I didn‚Äôt feel like tackling. Of course, it made everything else a lot harder, but we all know that story. I don‚Äôt have cravings anymore and never seriously consider going back, but lately I have noticed thoughts start to creep in about how maybe I was better, more productive, more efficient, while I was taking kratom. I 100% know this isn‚Äôt true and that I was actually a piece of shit on kratom, but the thoughts are still there. I shut them right down.

I guess this post is just to remind myself and others not to get too comfortable in recovery. I don‚Äôt think I will feel like I have truly recovered until I have a year or more off of it. In the meantime, I have been doing all of the things that are recommended: therapy, exercise, being open with loved ones, staying away from substances‚Ä¶and yet, the intrusive thoughts are still there. I know they are a normal part of recovery. I think it can be easy to feed into them if you‚Äôre not careful, but this isn‚Äôt my first rodeo with quitting kratom, so I‚Äôm being very careful. Wherever you are in your quit, be aware of your thoughts, tread lightly, and be careful and kind with yourself while recovering.

I took it about 5 years ago when I quit drinking for alcohol abstinence syndrome. I had drank heavily for probably close to 15 years. After quitting using a short stint of benzos prescribed by my doc to avoid seizures during WD, I was physically exhausted and emotionally in a very bad place. This stuff got me stabilized and feeling pretty good again in a matter of days.

Anyways, also used kratom for about 14.5 years, after a decade of prescription opiates and poppy pods. I'm currently 70 days off kratom now and also have been using LDN starting about day #10 of kratom CT. The naltrexone made a huge difference once the PAWS kicked in. I started natlrexone at only 0.25mg/day, and increased slowly, currently been on 0.75mg for a week. 

Recently, I've been have breakthrough bouts of PAWS the naltrexone wasn't blocking. I probably could increase the naltrexone again, but I have insomnia and increased anxiety each time I increase, so I'm going slowly. After another week or so, I will probably bump the naltrexone up a bit more if the anxiety calms down.

For the past three days, I've taken emoxypine 100mg first thing in the morning and it's been phenomenal for me. It's strange stuff, stimulating (motivating), but at the same time anxiolytic. My brain fog cleared after the second dose, I'm motivated again, the breakthrough RLS resolved and physically, I feel much better.

The recommended dosage for alcohol abstinence syndrome is 125mg 3x/day for 5-7 days. Emoxypine effects seem to build up and last for a while once I stopped taking it before. This time, I took 100mg two times on the first day and it was a bit much. I may just be sensitive to it. The last two days, I've just take 100mg first thing in the am. In about 30 mins, I'm awake and feeling pretty good. My partner commented on the first day about how much better I must be feeling by the way I was joking and acting. 

So I noticed similar effects from it as to when I quit drinking, increased energy/motivation, decreased brain fog, decreased depression and improved mood, etc. However, it also seems to have helped with the RLS breakthroughs I was having. I'm only taking it once/day, so in the am, I felt some whole body RLS, that resolved about 45 mins after taking it. Taking it 2-3x/day might cover me for a full 24 hours, but it wires me up a bit much. It seems to affect many things in the body, but some brief googling suggests that it improves dopamine content in the brain as well.

I'm not sure if this would help folks early on in their kratom recovery since I was a little over 2 months CT when I started it, but it really helped me get through the week. Going to continue taking it once daily for a week or so and see how it goes. At that point, I'll decide whether to continue it for a while, or take a break for a few days and see how I feel. I'm guessing it will require longer use than it does for alcohol WD syndrome, simply because kratom PAWS can last so damn long. Will be interesting to see.

Not suggesting anyone try this, just throwing my experience out there. I've had this sitting on my desk for a few years since I had used it before during alcohol PAWS, and decided to give it a try. So far, it's been positive for me. I would suggest avoiding or being careful with caffeine or stimulants with this, especially if you are having anxiety. Like I said, for me, it's stimulating, but at the same time calming. Caffeine is best avoided for me at this point.",7,0

If you didn‚Äôt know, many people with add/adhd get misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder or mood disorders because it actually affects your mood. I never considered I could have add/adhd. But I put the pieces together. None of my SSRIs worked, no med seemed to work. I was just marked as ‚Äúbipolar‚Äù or ‚Äúanxious‚Äù or ‚Äúuntreatable depression‚Äù. Realizing I have add/adhd and knowing I was using Kratom as a stimulant in small doses throughout the day to combat it made me realize I might have something else going on. Then I just looked back on my life and my old behaviors and thought patterns. I always did well in school - because I have an extremely high IQ so I didn‚Äôt have to ‚Äúwork‚Äù as hard. Never suspected I had add/adhd, but I can remember even as a child I first experienced anehodia. As young as 8 I was telling my dad I was bored of life and then I constantly needed stimulus. I presumed I just had a high IQ, therefore I needed to keep my brain busy.
Then here comes college where I actually need to work hard and where my Kratom addiction began. It worked at first, but only for about a month before well‚Ä¶ I started to not care about school, anyone, had no motivation, etc. 
Now I‚Äôve been diagnosed with adhd (inattentive type). I‚Äôve mentioned it here before but I started meds. Ironically, a lot of the side effects are similar to Kratom (zombie like feeling in particular). Not sure if I want to stay on the meds long term but it has changed my life like looking through glasses for the first time. I don‚Äôt crave extra stimulus such as drugs like Kratom, I quit caffeine for the most part, I even noticed I started vaping less because I felt like I didn‚Äôt need to.
Anyway i guess my point is a lot of times addiction can result from a misdiagnosis. Or even lack of vitamins has a huge influence on our brains and bodies. I‚Äôm not saying everyone here is like this, but it‚Äôs important to just be honest with your psych and dr.",6,0

I haven‚Äôt visited this sub in quite awhile. I used to visit, post and comment here often under a different account. This was probably 2 years ago or so

Anyways. Sometimes I forget just how fucking difficult it was to stop and stay stopped. I‚Äôm here to tell you that I NEVER think about it anymore. I‚Äôve had a few fleeting thoughts since but that‚Äôs about it. It‚Äôs just not even something I consider. Kratom was by far the toughest substance for me to quit, more than oxycodone, coke, benzos, alcohol, Marijuana, etc. 

it probably took me a year of everyday use of Kratom (2-3x/day) for me to even consider I may have a problem. Before that I felt like most of you did at one point, that it was magical or the thing that finally fixed all of my issues. I bought into all of the BS. For close to a year I told myself I‚Äôd cut down or stop and within a few hours to a day tops I was right back at it. And worst of all it stopped working. It didn‚Äôt do what it used to. I become increasingly more depressed and suicidal. I have no idea how or why I didn‚Äôt kill myself back then. It was that bad

Anyways at some point I switched over to tianeptine for a few weeks knowing about the horror stories there too. And my last day of work on feb 17th 2020, I puked several times at work and I left mid day to go to the hospital. They doctor couldn‚Äôt do anything for me‚Ä¶obviously lol. And I called up a friend and checked into a detox. I was there for a week. And used suboxone for a bit, not on it anymore. I used it as prescribed. Not medical advice and not telling anyone that‚Äôs how they should do it. Just saying what worked for me

Failure is an option. Trying multiple times is valid. Keep trying until you quit. It‚Äôs possible to make it further than you think. It‚Äôs possible every single day to want to not take this garbage anymore.

A year ago today I made the choice to stop taking kratom. I dumped my stash and settled in for something I‚Äôd never done. I made it through the worst of the physicals and I was stuck with my brain. I made it twelve days and caved. I told myself it was a decent break after taking it every day for 18 months. I didn‚Äôt know it at the time, but it was the motivation I would need 6 months later.

Of course it all went to shit rather quickly. All my plans for moderation went out the window and I was right back where I didn‚Äôt want to be. So, after six more months of slamming sludge and being miserable, I needed to quit again. And (so far), it has worked. I don‚Äôt really think about kratom anymore. There‚Äôs always the same anxiety and fear over what I‚Äôve done to my body. But it‚Äôs not what it was when I stopped. It‚Äôs not even close. Maybe it‚Äôll always be with me, but it‚Äôs a better feeling than needing to maintain a false sense of ease.

There‚Äôs no difference between myself, someone on hour 19 of quitting, and someone who hasn‚Äôt used kratom in 10 years. We‚Äôre all not taking it. We all decided to stop and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre doing. The emotions and feelings are different, but the goal is the same. If you don‚Äôt want to deal with this nonsense anymore, you‚Äôre more than capable of handling it. Do what it takes to stop. I don‚Äôt know what that means for you, but for me it meant 6 additional months to figure out something was wrong and I needed to quit. Find yours, jump off, and move on with your life.

I'm on 40 days sober after quitting CT from around 10~25gpd usually spread between 2 or 3 doses near the end of my use. I started using kratom because of my awful anxiety and depression and traditional methods of treating were not helping enough. It was great at first but eventually over a slow and long period of time I ended up a daily user dosing multiple times a day and developed a depedendacy. My main reason for quitting was because I was so sick of feeling depressed, anxious, and suicidal all the time after 6 or so years of trying everything I could to solve it and I hopped quitting kratom would help. I was very reliant on it and it became difficult to do things without it and I knew it wasn't a suitable way to live and something had to change if life was going to get better. Well I've been quite underwhelmed so far with my results from quitting. I'm still miserable a lot of the time and it's tough not having my crutch anymore. Obviously I can use coping skills but as I'm sure many of you know they're not nearly as effective as taking k, at least not in the short term. I find my cravings are the strongest they've been since this sobriety stint and I'm worried I'm gonna slip up soon. I try to tell myself it's just PAWS but then again I don't know because I was depressed and anxious before I ever even touched a single drug. I'm doing a lot of good stuff like trying to get enough sleep, eating well, exercising, getting outside, drinking lots of water, socializing, working on my career, trying to engage in meaningful activities but I still feel pretty shitty. I even got an amazing girlfriend since I got sober and filled the void of a deep meaningful relationship but even that doesn't seem to be enough right now. When I get down and start to get suicidal it's hard not to relapse because it's easy to just say, ""well kratom is better than killing yourself"".

Day 8, 60-ish gpd. Overall feeling surprisingly normal! Not great but not bad. Days 5/6 started taking LDN (no pwd but did have insomnia those nights, more on that later). Yesterday (Day 7) had to take a 3 hr flight back home, did not take any naltrexone (which can block the effects of immodium, enough said). However as I was walking through the airport yesterday, something suddenly occurred to me, I felt completely fine! And no thoughts of kratom or dosing! That alone brought so much joy! And best of all, coming home from the airport last night off the lightrail, I had to walk past 3 shops that sell kratom which I normally frequent and had absolutely NO desire or temptation despite knowing I could (since the naltx. from the day before had worn off). I was very proud of myself and truly know how strong my resolve is this time around. I can't wait to be in the double digits, and I have never made it past day 16 without relapsing but know it's different this time. I realize not everyone has access to certain medications or aren't feeling better at this point, but I know the rest of you have the strength in you too. You WILL feel normal again!   


Yesterday morning I still had some sweating/chills, which gabapentin helped dampen (although I am now tapering down on that, plan to completely quit it in a couple more days). I also have a low dose anti anxiety and depression rx's. I do imagine the Naltrexone is helping with the cravings part, however as I mentioned in another post/comments I am a little concerned that the days I took it I got no more than 1-2 hours sleep, despite helper meds which normally knocked me out like a baby. Researching a bit, insomnia can be a common side effects of the naltx./Vivitrol shot (which I had been planning on scheduling soon). That second day I took up to \~10mg throughout the day, which may have been pushing it (and really isn't considered low-dose at that point but wanted to test how ""wiped"" my receptors were). So today I decided to tweak the amount, I took just \~2mg in the morning and am going to see how that goes tonight. I also have a zoom appt with my addiction specialist tomorrow and will talk through all this, and over the next week or two will try and figure out if the Vivitrol shot is still the best course of action.

I've been using Kratom for 7 years now.  I've quit at much lower doses years ago and it wasn't awful.  I tried CT from 100gpd and made it 30 hours but had to work so I aborted.  That was three weeks ago, and I tapered to 16pgd.

I quit at 12pm yesterdary (20 hours ago), and the evening was rough at first, but I had some gabapentin (I took 200mg every hour from 6pm to 9pm).  I had a LOT of weed as well, and I was actually feeling pretty OK.   I got sleepy around 2am and slept until 9am (an hour ago).  I actually feel almost normal this morning.   No depression, anxiety or really anything.  Is this the pink cloud?  I feel a restlessness slowly building up in my legs however, but I have had no supplements or pharms in 7 hours.

So anyhoo, I was one of the users who became seriously constipated/retaining urine while tapering/quitting. I think I found a possible solution and hopefully it will help anyone struggling with the same issues. 

Pedialyte, NUUN and lots of bananas and avocados. Pedialyte has some great stuff in it but unfortunately it has very little potassium/magnesium. So I supplemented with bananas, avocados and some NUUN tablets I found on clearance. 

Another underrated and often unheard of electrolyte‚Ä¶calcium. When we hear the word calcium we often think of bone health and while it does serve a function in bone health, it is a MAJOR electrolyte for muscle firing/function and cell function. Calcium also helps prevent kidney stones by breaking down oxalates. So I‚Äôve been eating lots of muesli with fortified oat milk and bok choy (I don‚Äôt use dairy). 

I‚Äôve also been drinking a gallon of water everyday on top of prune juice (for fiber but also for glycogen replenishment after a workout) and pedialyte. I think kratom really does a number on our guts because it require so much water to breakdown and pass. Y‚Äôall ever brew up some kratom and filter it and see all the rock hard clumps? Gross. 

The pain/cramping sensation I‚Äôve been feeling in my lower abdomen is almost completely gone. I hope this will help someone else who needs it.

I am attending NA meetings, and I have a couple appointments per week with my therapist. I just met her and have only had 2 sessions with her. I like her overall so far, but she isn't an addiction specialist, so depending on how the next few sessions go, I may look elsewhere for therapy.

&#x200B;

I have already attended an IOP program before. Granted, I was high the whole time, but I still learned a lot and don't think I need intensive outpatient again. Probably just regular outpatient. I also work a corporate job where I am on a rotating schedule (I work 6am to 5pm one week, then I work 10am to 9pm the next week), and I have 3 daughters, so there simply is not enough time in a day for me to attend 25 hours per week of IOP, and scheduling that would be difficult.

&#x200B;

I am looking for any suggestions on virtual addiction treatment programs. I think I am looking for group therapy for addicts, maybe some classes on coping skills, and potentially individual therapy with a counselor with solid knowledge of addiction problems. I think I probably need to get a dual diagnosis. Online/virtual services are going to work best for me. I have tried LionRock recovery. They are pushing very hard to get me into IOP, but the majority of that program is scheduled for times when I work. Their regular outpatient program would cost me about $900 per month even with insurance.

Please let me know if you have any ideas or resources or recommendations on services you used for recovery/addiction treatment. I'm very excited to get as much help as possible with my recovery. I need it to stick this time around.

Today as of 630pm est is 24 hours with no Kratom. After a 3 year addiction using approx. 20-30 gpd. I am finally ready to give this stuff up.

I am not going to go into to many details of the negative effects of Kratom cause if you are suffering with an addiction you already know them all to well.

But I do want to share with you something that I think is not so common among the audience of this subreddit.

Believe it or not, Kratom was a gateway drug for me. Prior to starting to take Kratom I was not a user of any kind of drugs. I did experiment as a teenager with a number of substances. But being in my late 30s, that was a very long time ago. What I am trying to say is prior to getting hooked on Kratom I was not a recreational or habitual user of drugs. But since starting down the dark path of Kratom I have been taking / trying any drug I could get my hands on including my daily habit of The K. 

I want to tell you about me. I am a successful executive level employee for a major corporation. You know, a suit. I live a typical middle class existence with mortgages, wife, kids, company picnics , boardroom meetings etc. But for the last 3 years I have been living a life of executive by day, complete junkie by night. This has led to some pretty risky behaviour. This has been even more dangerous because money has been no issue. 

(I don‚Äôt say all this to brag, I know there‚Äôs a lot of you out there struggling, I am just trying to illustrate that this stuff can get you no matter your circumstance)

Because of my Kratom and drug use. It has jeopardized my job and career. It has ruined a few friendships, it has made my wife lose a ton of respect for me (even though she doesn‚Äôt know, or at least I haven‚Äôt confessed) and basically has kept me in a Kratom induced haze for the last 3 years.

But today that ends. I understand the reasons for my drug use. And although they aren‚Äôt fixed I know that I can deal with them without substances.

Anyways. I flushed my Kratom. Have gone 24 hours and am ready to say goodbye to the stuff and all other substances forever.

Please, if your out there struggling with addiction be it from Kratom or something else. Get help, do whatever you can to fight the beast and unlock the endless potential that is living deep within us all.

I‚Äôve successfully quit and I couldn‚Äôt thank this community enough. I‚Äôve been off for over a month now and I experimented with a variety of methods, but the slow taper worked best. My slow taper lasted 16 weeks. I know this is much longer than needed, but I‚Äôm busy with life and my career, so I pursued the path of least resistance. I consumed 30-40gpd for 3 years. For additional context, I have a very addictive personality and have experience quitting Vicodin/Opiates, weed, and Xanax in the past too. Quitting Kratom was different though. I think it‚Äôs taken too lightly. You figure ‚Äúit‚Äôs natural, it‚Äôs not as strong as Opiates‚Äù so you fool yourself into thinking it‚Äôs safe. Kratom was more difficult for me to quit than anything else that I have before. 

I built out a spreadsheet and tried to start with limiting my dose to 16gpd from week one. This was a very significant cut and it was a very challenging starting point. I was fatigued, I had head and body aches, felt very low, terrible RLS, sleepless nights, and worst of all, constant diarrhea. I had no idea how chemically dependent my body truly was until I started the taper. 

For the first 3 weeks, I cut down 2 grams per week(16->14->12) and I was still struggling with the same week 1 symptoms, so I decided to slow the taper even more. The following weeks, I slowed the taper down to 10.5->9.5->8.6->8.4->7.8). Although this is very slow and seems pointless, it definitely started to improve the withdrawal symptoms. My body seemed to get used to less Keaton consumption and I was improving. 

I did hit over 3 weeks of a lull period where I wasn‚Äôt cutting down from 7.5gpd. I was slipping with the taper and would have days where I would take an additional dose, or rationalize higher doses for myself. I felt like I was cheating myself and giving up on recovery, but the time helped adjust my body to less and less Kratom. 

After week 12, I got aggressive with the taper again and dropped down to 7, to 6-5.5 in the same week, then 5-4 in the same week, then down to 3.5-3. After week 16, I decided to jump after making it one day entirely without Kratom. 

SUPPLEMENTS I USED TO HELP:
1. Adrenal Restore Supplements - Amazon
2. B12, BComplex, Vitamin D, Multivitamins
3. Black seed Oil, I read that I helped with opiate withdrawal, so I added it to my supplement list. 
4. Ginseng, and additional caffeine

These are obviously not touching my anxiety as they're not intended to.  My depression hasn't surfaced in the 9 days I've been clean, but my anxiety is out of this world.

So far today I lifted weights for a half hour, ran for 1.5 miles, did like 10 rounds of wim hoff, 2 cold showers.  Forced myself to clean my bathroom and bedroom, have some laundry in the wash...so I'm functional, but I wanna blow my brains out (sorry for the hyperbole, but it kinda feels like an accurate depiction) due to severe anxiety.  I haven't had a moment of peace at all today.  Also, for those keeping up with my progress, I relapsed on nicotine.  Didn't help much, but at least im not pacing back and forth lookin for nicotine.  

So...my question...should I mention my relapse and try and get a short script for something to treat my anxiety? I dint want benzos or anything addicting because I will abuse it if I have it...100%.

I had a 10-15 gpd habit for about 2 and a half years. In June of this year I switched to strictly 6 caps 3 times a day. I am a 5'2 130 lbs 31 year old female with no health problems.

Things kept popping up that caused me to push back quitting CT. Well, I live in Louisiana and evacuated to Alabama (where kratom is illegal) for the storm (hopefully I still have a home) so I figured I'd use this opportunity to quit. It wasn't 100% CT but basically. I took my normal dose Sunday 6 caps 3x a day. Monday I did 6 caps 2x a day and Tuesday I took my last 6 caps.  

I took my last 6 caps at 8 AM yesterday (so maybe this is still day 1) Right now it's 12 PM in my location currently. So far just extreme fatigue and body ache. I don't have to worry about anxiety or insomnia because I have prescribed Xanax. But the body aching and fatigue is kicking my ass. I don't even have the energy to play video games.

I managed to drag myself to the store and bought some ibuprofen and vitamin C. These have taken the edge off but I still just feel like a giant uncomfortable blob. I wonder how long this will last? Seems like some people say it's 3-5 days and pretty much just mental stuff after that. I hope so. I couldn't imagine dealing with this for weeks.


EDIT: update this post is approximately 6 hours old. Since then I went to a smoke shop and bought some Delta 8. Not sure if it's that or just my w/d but I would say my discomfort overall went down from an 7 to about a 6.

EDIT 2: I am 49 hours since my last dose. Honestly the worst of it was from day 1's afternoon to day 2's evening. Today I woke up and I feel a bit better, no I don't feel normal but only my back hurts and I am a little tired and that's about it. I think on the misery scale at my worst I was about a 7. Last night I was feeling more of a 6. But today I'd say I feel like a 4. I think the depression is kept under control because I take Wellburtrin and the euphoria I felt from Kratom stopped well over a year ago. I basically took my dose to feel less tired/ache that's all it's really been doing for me for months. I've only ever gotten mild Euphoria from it since I probably fried my receptors from all the actual opiate abuse from my past.

I‚Äôve been using Kratom for less than a year and currently I‚Äôm at 30GPD. I feel like my body is telling me it‚Äôs done with this stuff but I‚Äôm scared to quit. I thought I would be able to quit no problem until I found this sub. I have 2 little kids and don‚Äôt have the time to feel like shit. I‚Äôm so mad at myself for thinking this stuff was harmless!

I‚Äôve always loved the effects of kratom, mostly the energy when I‚Äôve needed it as a busy mom, and the sleep help since I‚Äôve been experiencing crazy insomnia from perimenopausal symptoms. 

I‚Äôve weaned down before to take modified t-breaks but only once was able to get all the way off when I had a surgery I had to prepare for. Other than that, I saw no reason to get off the stuff. It helped me, so why take breaks, right?

Well in the last few weeks/months kratom has changed for me. (No doubt because my body has gotten used to it daily and my body has adapted, therefore making it less effective now). Yes I get subtle energy still and it does help me sleep but I‚Äôve had to dose an extra time in the night and even couple that with other sleep aids sometimes (a little cbd or cbn oil). 

But I no longer get the warm tinglies I used to. My moods were like roller coasters, up during the first 2-3 hours, down the rest of the time in between doses. It was exhausting. I always thought kratom helped my moods but now I know it probably contributed more to their issues. 

Never did I ever think I‚Äôd quit this stuff. I‚Äôm the kratom advocate singing its praises to my friends and family. And not only do I have a crap ton of it left (no worries, I‚Äôm not tempted by it in the least and I‚Äôm not concerned about wasted money), but it‚Äôs been part of my routine every 3-4 hours for 2 years. And honestly, if it still worked the same for me every single time without needing to increase my doses, I‚Äôd still be on it. But now I also get wds every single time about 20 mins before a dose. üôÑ It gets old dosing just to feel normal. 

I‚Äôve been tapering over the last several weeks. I‚Äôm down to 9gpd as of yesterday and today I‚Äôm even starting to skip doses and just get through it. I hope to be out of this taper soon. I can do it!

Thanks for reading. This is more for accountability and to remind myself where I‚Äôm at and why I‚Äôm doing this.",17,0

Feel alright except little sleep...anyone experience insomnia due to Naltrexone?,"Coming off 60gpd, feeling physically ok and def through the acutes. I started LDN the night before last. That first night, I loaded up on helper meds, feel asleep at around 10, set an alarm for 2am, woke up then and took 2mg. I fell back asleep right away but woke up a ton, probably every thirty minutes after that, however no pwd. Yesterday (day 6ct) took 2mg in the morning, 4 mg 2hrs later, and then 6mg after that, also no pwd aside from some minor restless legs when first in bed. HOWEVER I hardly got any sleep. I literally laid there tossing and turning all night. Finally got some broken up sleep between 7-9am then gave up (on vacation at family's, thank god not working rn). I know this is common during withdrawal, especially this early on, however due to my current helper med regimen, I had been sleeping like a baby those first 5 days, up to 10 hrs a night, up until that first night after the naltrexone. This frightens me because I'm supposed to be getting the Vivitrol shot soon (not yet scheduled) but also I start a new job in a week and a half, and absolutely cannot function on little to no sleep when working. Insomnia has often been the #1 reason I cave in past quits especially when working. A little research says insomnia can be a common side affect of Vivitrol. For those of you who have exp with Viv/Nalt. any thoughts or advice?",1,0

I've almost turned into a professional quitter. But the 1-2 month range is where I always relapse. 
If I hang out on these boards too much, I think about kratom too much. So I'll make this post count lol.

This go round, I've put about 2 months of work/prep into this quit. 
Loaded on vitamins and supplements for last 2 months. Multi vitamin, large amounts of vit C, vitamin D, turmeric, fish oil, ashwagahndra root, milk thistle, mushroom vitamins, fucking anything I figured would help me. 

I've also been mentally prepping. Telling myself this has to be the quit that lasts. Telling myself to remain calm. Understand my triggers. Understand what gives me anxiety and address it when in the scenario. Remembering and taking into consideration the hardships of previous failed quits on loved ones. And so on.

I came clean to family, and work. I understand not everyone can do this. But if you can, my view is the more people that can hold you accountable, the better. Work is my biggest trigger, by a mile, so I asked my boss and a few peers to keep an eye on me. 

Lastly, I found a rehab place that mentioned kratom. I talked to them for around a month, and started there this week. They drug test for kratom. They understand the drug. They've had a couple people come in for kratom, but not a ton. Everyone in group sessions is supportive, and doesn't look at you like your a wuss for coming in for kratom. Most other folks in rehab have never heard of it to be honest. 
If you have the financial means, or good insurance to help, don't scoff at it. 
My rehab place makes you go clean on everything, so if you don't want that, ask ahead if time what they allow. 

I'm day 5 today clean, of everything. Alcohol clean for 9 days now. Kratom for 5. 
Sucks I have to give up weed also. But 18 years of being on a substance daily, I think going clean will be new and good. 

My withdrawals aren't great feeling, but I'm on schedule and starting to be more active. I feel the prep work has helped. 
My real work comes in the 2 weeks to 2 months range. I figure I'll stay in rehab for 3 months and see what I feel like before making a decision.

I've put everything in place I absolutely can. The failure of this quite solely would land on me. This has the be the quit. 

Hang tough everyone. It's a bitch. If you fail, try try again. Make each quit like a ritual, proper planning helps.",7,0

My bowel movement is still not solid.  I take triple calm magnesium as directed, but I‚Äôm starting to wonder with my grass fed whey protein shake and then my hemp protein shake if I‚Äôm maybe getting to much, I‚Äôve bumped my sun theanine up to 800mg. But I noticed the moment I stopped taking all supplements I feel a little better

I‚Äôm on my last day of adderall for a while, and clonazepam as well.  I may still use atarax or I may just find myself falling asleep when I can instead of worry about sleeping and forcing it with the meds.  So the adderall is like a super coffee if you know what I mean.   I‚Äôm happy though I went from painful bleeding hemorrhoid poops, to I‚Äôm done in literally 10 seconds.  I‚Äôm working on cbt for the anxiety and sleep. And I still got gabapentin I can substitute for the clonazepam not to side track.  But can anyone tell me why? I can give a full list of my supplements if need be but it seems magnesium is doing nothing along with most of my supplements. I‚Äôve been taking them even through my addiction.

I hope to do a rapid taper through Friday and make the jump Saturday, using my long weekend to deal with the detox.

Day 1-4: buckle down, embrace the suck. Grow learn, be patient. Take supplements and a boat load of water 

Day 5-7: much improved! Emotions coming back, tingling nerves reconnecting, sweating subsiding a bit. Can work, do chores, light workouts easy to push through 

Day 8: Amazing! 

Day 9: just started and cannot wait for the day.  Woke up naturally at 530am. Watched the sunrise with coffee for the first time in years. Missed my wife when she woke up with a smile. Life is vastly improved.
