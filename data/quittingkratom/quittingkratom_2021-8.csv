2021-08-30 23:06:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/pexib0/8_months_ct_update/,8 months CT Update,"I kicked my habit the first week of the year and went through the shit hardcore. Panic attacks, insomnia, days long psychotic episode, derealization, depersonalization, loss of inner monologue, convinced I was dead and that my experience was living hell. I didn't taper. I didn't plan. I jumped off a 50g/day habit thinking I'd be fine. I was a staunch proponent on the stuff and worked for a tea shop that revolved around it and normalized it. Oh how much my world has changed since the quit. I'm stable, on the right meds for my depression/anxiety/panic disorder/bpd/ocd. I have an amazing psychiatrist. I have a pcp for the first time in my adult life. I've taken care of myself more in this time than I ever have. I've quit weed and I'm so close to kicking a 16 year nicotine habit. I've decreased my caffeine intake from ~600mg/day to ~150. I've been sober from booze and narcotics for five years but it's so clarifying to be off of everything else I was abusing while telling myself it's ""natural"". I have more money than I've ever had in my life. I've gotten my credit squared away. I've paid my taxes. I'm totally self-employed. I'm reading as much as possible. I'm making music and art when I can. I've written a novella. I'm totally committed to my total independence and autonomy and committed to never going back.

Edit: I forgot to mention that I adopted a feral cat about two months into the quit. It took me about four months for her to let me pet her, but now she's obsessed with me and will not leave me alone. Which is both wonderful and annoying. 

Now for the bad stuff. Since I've stopped being unable to eat from being to bloated on dirt water I've gained weight and that's depressing. The sleep troubles didn't go away until about 6.5 months in. I think it's coming back a little bit but I'm prepared. My face is perpetually greasy. I seem to go through phases where my face gets red and flush and warm and my face gets super greasy. I've earned a panic disorder out of this. Researching detox and stuff reawakened OCD in me. 

All in all, I'm so stoked to be dirt water free. I'm happy. I'm so thankful for y'all here. I feel like if it weren't for this sub, I'd have totally lost myself back then. 

Congrats to all those who've kicked it. One day off this shit is an amazing feat. You got this!

To all those thinking about it, the only advice I have is that I think you should do it, make sure you have some time off to handle the first couple days, get fluids, get antacids, lay down in the shower/take a bath, watch some comforting shows/movies, take it easy, be kind to yourself, get outside and walk if you can. Y'all got this!",19

I'm coming off up to 60 gpd, almost 5 year user. Many attempted quits in the past but finding my mental resolve is much stronger this time around. Withdrawals have been minor thanks to gabapentin (also helping me get plenty of sleep). I highly recommend trying to get your hands on some for that first 5 days.  I'm currently holed up with family but fly back home in a few days. I also have some Naltrexone, and plan on taking approx 1mg tonight, then slowly build up. Was pretty successful in the past with this. I wanted to start this process with naltrexone before I get back home, where there are at least 5 shops that sell it within a 10 minute walk. Also starting a new job in a couple of weeks so I HAVE to succeed this time and be free of this monster. Good luck fellow quitters!",10

Then i took a shower, reached out to a few people, and my best friend prayed for me and opened up to me about some feelings he has....then I started feeling like i was on ecstasy and im like F\*\*\* i cant deal with all of this sh\*\* lol. its a damn rollercoaster today and i dont really know how to handle it lol.

But I think I am fighting allergies on top of these withdrawals.  I can't sleep much because my legs are so bad from kratom and I think they are worse for me because I deal with Neuropathy so badly. I mean I can't walk well because of Neuropathy and am always in pain from it.  But I will not take drugs for it.  Anyway today I am a tad better.  I am still so sleepy which I will be for at least another two or more weeks because of the leg issues.  No matter what unless I knocked myself completely out I can't get my legs calm.  I exercise them but I know from last time in withdrawals my legs were the last to stop driving me insane and robbing me of sleep.  So I just have to deal with it.  I am starting back on meditation for giving me a few hours of sleep to make up for nighttime.  

My head is full and very foggy but maybe allergies.  I get them bad in the change of the seasons so 4 times a year.  But again I won't take anything for them.  I react to drugs and just can't tolerate them anymore now that I am so much healthier and so much fewer toxins in my body. 

So that is where I am now.  At least I am done with kratom.  Now I will go through the rest of my withdrawals and hopefully in a couple more weeks have my life back and onward and upward.  

God bless all of us and we can do this for the health of it.",9

I ended up reaching a point where I have been taking 3-4 ounces per day. I am trying to quit, and it has been a wild ride. I am struggling with the detox, so I keep getting 1-3 days under my belt then relapsing. There are a lot of reasons for those relapses, but I am trying again, and I am ready to pour EVERYTHING I have into my recovery.

One of my main struggles with sobering up is the emotional garbage that comes from it. I am wondering if you guys have had similar experiences and might have any advice on how I can move forward and get better.

I am 32, and I have struggled with depression since I was a teenager. I was also introduced to substances when I was 12 or 13. This is where one of my biggest problems is coming from. I feel like I have only had 1 coping skill for anything and everything for most of my life, and that's been using drugs or alcohol. I really do mean everything. I use when I'm sad, anxious, angry, excited, bored, uncomfortable, lonely, sick, hurt, etc. 

My question to you guys is how do I learn some new coping skills? Even just basic ones. How do I learn to feel my feelings? How do I learn to sit with my discomfort? All I know how to do is use, and I don't want to anymore. I think if I can start to figure out how to work through being uncomfortable, process my emotions instead of pushing them away, or sit with my feelings and be okay with feeling I will have more success with my recovery.

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you guys for being here.",17

I am taking these to mean it is time to quit and I am down from 110 gpd (of tea) to 25 gpd on my taper. Did this over 3 weeks. Kinda fast but I did it bc the symptoms I started getting prior to the taper were tingling/itchy/numb hands and feet, anxiety, perhaps increased hair loss (everyone loses hair, so this is hard to tell as a male at 39 y.o.), increased urination, and the kicker is the damn annoying metallic taste in my mouth. Health scans and blood work test normal. 

Updated symptoms at my current moment 3 weeks into the taper are just the metallic taste and potential hair loss….anxiety much better and less to no N/T in hands and feet. Urination has gone back to normal. This brings me to my point…..has anyone had any of these symptoms PRIOR to decided to quit and used them as motivation. Curious about the random negative health issues that people have had and if it was enough to make them quit. Terrified of the day I will go CT, but it will happen.

Most of that time, it was about 10 g in the evening, sometimes 5 g to run in the afternoon and then 10-15 g in the evening.  It got me through the first year of the pandemic, it got me through the initial boredom after I stopped drinking, got me running regularly, and it objectively improved my life.  However, over the past month or so, I saw it spiral out of control somewhat.  It became difficult to do any task without taking a few grams first (not impossible but very unfun).  We moved across the country and most of the tasks required a small dose of Kratom.  I've tried tapering but it hasn't worked because some days I feel like I'm cutting back a vitamin or an SSRI: i.e., it makes life easier with minimal side effects.  Except, I don't know per se that I need it:  I'm in a new place, starting a new job, I haven't drank in a long time, things are generally going well, and there's a good chance I do not need this crutch.  I could certainly do without swallowing nauseating goo, being constipated, or having disrupted sleep.

I have about a week until the job starts and I've kind of accidentally taken a couple of days off.  I drank a little Kava to keep the anxiety down and I just have not felt like taking Kratom.  I'm a wreck today and I'm going to see what tomorrow feels like.  Hopefully, I'm nearing the worst of the physical symptoms.  I can manage the rest with other supplements and exercise.",3

I know a few of you asked me to check in due to Hurricane Ida. It's been quite the 48 hours. The first day was miserable. It took 13 hours to travel less than 300 miles due to the mass evacuation. Yesterday was a long day as well. However, I found out this morning that my loved ones are okay, and my house was not destroyed. It may be a month or more before I have electricity, and i likely have some water damage, but my work is remote, so I may just use this as an opportunity for travel. I'm currently sitting by a beautiful beach on the  Atlantic Ocean.

Now would be a time in which many would allow themselves to relapse. However, crisis is an excellent test of resolve. I passed multiple head shops that likely sell kratom in the area. I have had no inclination to stop in and buy some. I am resolved to meet crisis with a clear head.

It went well, but yes, the underlying metrics that led to an addiction in the first place have never been addressed by me. So it happened that after plenty of personal turmoil I started drinking, about a year ago. And of course, I got addicted. Realizing this, I decided to do a detox and get some therapy looking at why on earth I quickly fall for addictions. Anyway, I have been sober from Alcohol for a month now as well, and am going through PAWS for this particular drug as well. Now this demon inside my brain keeps suggesting me to ""just take some Kratom until the Alcohol PAWS are over"". Especially when I have nothing to do or find it particular hard just to find some inner peace without any substance running through my system. Logically, I know this is a bad idea, especially after 5.5 years off of it. Can someone please give me some advice as to how to stay strong? Thank you so much. It shows sobriety is a life long task.",17

I recently quit Kratom about 3 weeks ago, I was on an high daily dose, 160-200 gpd. On the last day I quit out of necessity it was unplanned because my tolerance had built up to the point where I could take a 50g dose and only get partial relief for about 90 to 120 min, so the dosing I needed to maintain stability at that point gave me mitragynine toxicity. I literally could not continue.

The first week I took suboxone which I obtained clinically, and it seemed fine, I was able to sleep.

The heart palpitations and racing heart were always there but about a 8 days ago it became horrible, I cannot sleep laying down because it puts too much pressure on my heart  and I begin getting some pain in my left arm and heart palpitations. It’s been 3 weeks and I still cannot sleep lying down and I basically I’ve in fear of the next onset of heart symptoms. 

Wondering if anyone else had these issues and could tell me anecdotally, I realize every experience is different, but how long it lasted.

 Thank you!",4

2021-08-29 23:18:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/pe9x3v/little_encouragement_for_all_those_struggling/,Little encouragement for all those struggling,"Hey all, decided enough time had passed and wanted to come here to encourage anyone on the fence about quitting or going through withdrawals right now.

Little bit of backstory, I was taking roughly 60 grams a day for nearly 2 years. It was the first thing I did when I woke up, and re-dosed about every 2 hours until bedtime. Overtime I wasnt even feeling the kratom and  90% of the time I was just avoiding withdrawals. Decided I had enough of this shit and went full cold turkey. BEST DECISION I EVER MADE. Admittedly I kind of rushed this as I wasnt nearly as prepared with supplements to help myself through it but this subreddit was a huge help with that. I’m currently on day 10 cold turkey and already feeling loads better mentally and physically. Yes, the physical withdrawals were pretty bad, but manageable. Id say my biggest difficulty was getting to sleep, in the last 9 days I’ve averaged about 3-4 hours of sleep a night which is very unusual for me since i usually sleep a solid 8-10. I’ve been surrounding myself with friends and family, staying as engaged as possible, the worst thing you can do for yourself is to hole yourself up in your room alone with your thoughts. When you are struggling, take a long walk, get up and move around, do your absolute best to not dwell on it. Every single time I had a dark moment and felt like it wouldnt pass it always did. And i felt stronger and more prepared every single time I got through it. Showers also helped me a lot, sometimes i took 4 or 5 a night just to calm down. But with every passing day it got easier and easier and much more manageable. I know I’m not out of the woods yet but my resolve to quit this shit is unshakeable, and i know i will feel back to myself sooner than later. Day 1 i took 200 dollars worth of kratom i had and dumped that shit out on the lawn and never looked back and i can honestly say its the best decision ive ever made to take back control of my life. Didnt regret it once. If anyone is struggling right now please reach out to me, i can help encourage and maybe give some tips and tricks that helped me get through the worst of it. I love you guys, and i know each and everyone of us can get through this. Sometimes we all just need a bit of help.",26
2021-08-29 22:57:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/pe9lnw/its_been_5_years_my_experience/,Its been 5 years - My Experience,"Male in my early(ish) 30s. In 2015, my then gf introduced me to K. It became just an occasional habit which grew to a weekly habit. I worked nights (still do) and I remember how lovely those days were. Coming home to our apartment and her having a pot brewing. We'd go for long late night walks - discussing our plans for buying our first house. Fast forward a year, we buy our first place. Late spring of 2016. Big year for me, and us.

The habit kept growing- I remember how productive we were - painting, renovating, decor. I had a rule that I wouldnt take Kratom to work. Well by early Fall - I was doing just that and remember how much fun it made working!

From there it just spiraled. I gained weight, It ruined my confidence in our sexlife and eventually our relationship fell apart in 2018. Still in a dust haze, I was optimistic - thought I was free and could do whatever I wanted. But I just became a total mess. 2017-2020 were a total blur. I started noticing how sick I would become without my dose - how terrible the constipation was - how my word recall and verbal skills went to total shit. I was always quick witted and funny and my addiction just made me the opposite.

At the end of 2019, after completing a music project that I was contractually obligated to do , I just hit a wall. Depression and anxiety hit me  - things that were ALIEN to me while on the green sludge. I realized finally one day in 2020 when I pulled globs of hair out of the shower drain - and finally seeing my scalp and how thin my pony tail was - that my hair was falling out.

This sounds vain, but it was the last straw for me...as I cannot ever pull off the shaved head look and my brother 8 years my senior still has a full head of hair. At that point I figured it was stress, from suppressing feelings through my addiction ...but only this week did I find this reddit page - and its been a massive relief.

I was pretty successful weening in early 2020, but I decided Id sell my place (it was a townhome) and start over. That whole renovation in preparation of the sale was stressful (mostly due to psycho obsessive 50 year old neighbor that scared off buyers as she literally told me not to leave her). She had cameras everywhere and would comment on my dating life, guests, and comings and goings. Attempting to ween there was getting extremely difficult mentally. I finally sold the place and moved on.

At my height, I was probably consuming 80+ gpd. I widdled my way the first time down to 12gpd. Worked my way back to about 40gpd...and now Since July, ive weened to about 21gpd. I subtract 3g every friday. First few weeks are tough, but it got easier. I really just want to feel normal again and have my hairback. Im more motivated than ever to get off it - but I still feel unmotivated creatively and couldn't enjoy some travel I did a few months ago.

I feel confident my hair will grow back, especially after reading all of these posts. It sounds vain but its one of the biggest motivating factors to get off the sludge. Not to mention, having normal erections again (god how embarrassing). Fortunately I always had a thick head of hair - so It doesnt look obvious, but I have this thinning patch on the right front side of my head.

Sorry for the novel, but if you made it this far...THANKS! Thank you for all your stories and encouragement everybody! I can tell you one thing that changed my life and that is Emotional Clearing by John Ruskan.",19

I've been browsing this sub for a long time now, searching for motivation to quit -- a long term goal of mine.

I've been using kratom for 3-4 years or so, and for the past couple years I've ranged anywhere from 8-30 GPD, at various times. I'm recently trying to taper down again and quit for good. I'm currently between 24-27 GPD, unfortunately.

I have experience with the W/D process, and have tried the CT route a couple times but haven't found much success. I'm about to start on 10mg of Citalopram/Celexa (an SSRI), and I'm curious if anyone has any experience with SSRI's while tapering, or generally using kratom. 

I've searched this sub as well as the kratom subreddit (though I take that information with a grain of salt, due to the potential for bias), and it's been a pretty mixed bag. 

So please, if you would, share your experiences! I would be very appreciative. Thanks!",3

I went back to college and I've struggled this past week to keep up. Kind of feel like my brain is worn out from years of heavy kratom use. This has led me to have these urges to buy. I wouldn't exactly call them cravings but it's more like intrusive thoughts of the nostalgia.

I actually slipped up and browsed my old vendor's website yesterday. It made me feel like, what I call ""pre-drug"" high. Like right after you buy your bag of Kratom, you got it in your hand, and you KNOW the next few hours are going to be like fucking cloud 9. Luckily I killed that feeling before it got out of control!

The nostalgia is really my addiction tricking me with the positive memories of Kratom. That's not what it was like though. It was 30 minutes of high, and hours of this uncomfortable buzzy feeling. Then guilt and depression that I was addicted to this shit. Fear of WDs. Random nausea. Inconsistent batches, wobbles, impossible poops.. rage.. low T.. fog.. unstudied..  the list goes on. I wished to be free, and now I am!

I am an addict BUT FIRST an adult. I have nobody to plead me to go to stop. Nobody gives a fuck if I destroy my brain with drugs. Nobody is going to force me to drink kratom. I am in full control of myself and I have to believe it if I want a better future.

I still get Rls once or twice a week but it has been getting way better.  I quit July 11 and had one slip up where I took a kratom shot one day on vacation.  It was dumb.  I never did it again.  What's crazy is I don't even crave it.  I had a serious back injury that hit me the week before my quit.  I was in so much pain I thought it help, but I realized it was just going to prolong my wd.

It's been a stressful time.  I'm quitting my job tomorrow to start a new job.  I'm super excited.  I think I have paws.  I am less motivated.  I have brain fog.  It's tough for me to know because I had covid 4 months and had a few lasting effects.

I don't feel like I am myself, but I'm doing ok almost on two months besides the one-day slip-up.

I don't want to replace one drug for another but when I use to be into nootropics I found noopept and selank to be helpful.  I only took them short term.

I found myself okay with not having a job, with not talking to people, and basically stopping my hobbies. A few days ago, I dumped out 200 or more grams of kratom, leaving around 50.  At first I told myself I was going to go cold turkey, but that first day was rough. I wanted to jump out of my skin. So I took 10, and it really helped. The next day I basically relapsed, taking 20. I was so ashamed for that that I knew I'd never be taking that amount again. Yesterday, I took 3 in the morning and 3 at night. After my dose of 3 at night I found myself looking through this subreddit. You guys gave me the motivation to throw the rest out and be done with this shit. I've been very sweaty, and my body feels weird, of course with an inability to sleep, but I am so happy right now. Thank you to everyone in this sub. All of your stories helped me so much. I'll probably post an update in a few days.",6

I have gone through opiate withdrawals many times before, but never from kratom - kratom always stuck as some sort of maintenance tool or comfort blanket. Recently I lost control and got up to about 10-15gpd leaf and at least another 10-30gpd in extracts on top of it. I had enough as the toll it started to take on my mood and overall mental health out huge strain on my marriage, as well as the fact I was hiding just how much I was using. Jumped CT 6 days ago and tried to apply knowledge from last WD experiences, without diving into prescription seeking or other narcotic use (save cannabis if you consider it a narcotic). I settled on a pretty good regimen for day-to-day maintenance, that has let me be functional and not completely exhausted and mentally incapacitated enough that I can get some momentum and hang on to it. It is as follows:

Morning:
750mg agmatine sulfate
1 tbsp black seed oil, formulated with extra thymoquinone
1100-1650mg turmeric & 10-15 mg black pepper fruit extract (same capsule, black pepper doesn't usually come alone. Most often formulated with turmeric.)
220mg naproxen as needed for aches/pains
12mg loperamide (drop after day 3 or 4 if possible - I promise you will still take a dump within a day or two of stopping.)
200mg L-theanine

Throughout the day, if needed, dose another TSP, not necessarily TBSP, though I doubt it would hurt - of black seed oil.
CBD and/or light cannabis use through the day helps.
If you can find it, kava extract is great if your anxiety starts to build.

Night:
200mg L-theanine
50-100mg ashwagandha
50-100mg chamomile
25-50mg passion flower
1000mg valerian root
10-20 mg melatonin
5mg black pepper/550mg turmeric
1 TSP black seed oil
If needed, cannabis/CBD.

Now, I'll admit my night regimen has been most effective only since day 4 - I'm sure we all know the first, second and third nights have the most hell waiting for you. I personally didn't, but if you find you are absolutely failing to sleep, if you can get access to 0.25 mg xanax, or at least 1000mg gabapentin, they will be very helpful. I recommend against prescription or narcotic usage unless absolutely necessary, though.
But, since that third night, following this to a T, I have been feeling almost 100% back to operational capacity. I like to tell myself it's not just pink clouding, but no matter what it is, this supplemental regimen gave me the ability to get momentum in feeling better and maintain it, if not sometimes picking up more.

I hope this finds someone struggling and helps them - I will say I spent years underestimating how bad kratom withdrawal could be compared to things like PST, heroin or Tianeptine. But an opiate/oid is an opiate/oid. Hell comes for you no matter what. My thoughts are with all of you struggling, you CAN do this! The frustration, pain, anxiety and discomfort are only TEMPORARY! Keep going!

Background: 
34, married, two year old daughter, own a business.

Current Medical things: 
- I'm on 0.5mg Xanax 2x daily for anxiety (once upon waking around 530am, another around 1130am - noon. I'm prescribed 3x day but the 2x/day does it's job while leaving me with a back stockpile for if I go on vacation/out of town before my scheduled refill time and can't get a refill early. Learned long ago how stressful it is to anticipate running out and not being able to get my refill early. 

- I'm on low dose Tramadol (EDIT just checked my bottle, it's 50mg) for my back and knee injuries, prescribed for 3x a day, but I only take it 2x a day on the same schedule as xanax for the same reasons. RARELY I may take a third dose for pain if I'm having a physically exhaustive day from work/kayaking/yard work/etc.

- Caffeine use is around 150mg - 200mg twice a day (300-400mg total); chug half a drink upon waking along with my meds, drink the other half throughout the morning. Repeat with lunch meds. Occasionally I'll throw in another 100mg or so depending on if my plans/activities are beyond the scope of my ""normal"" routine.

- 600mg of Motrin as needed for pain.

- Low amounts of THC daily recreational.

Current Kratom Use (capsules):

- 4 to 5 capsules with morning meds, 4 to 5 with noon meds. Occasionally will take an extra 2 or 3 caps between doses if my workload is daunting or if I'm at home and feel like I ABSOLUTELY have to get shit done (chores, projects) or if I need a bit of a boost in creativity for my guitar playing or writing. 

So I started kratom a few years back...was at a head-shop buying papers, saw the little 10 cap sampler, did a quick read on my phone, bought it on a whim. At first, it really helped me with my social anxiety and motivation issues which was great; it got me out of the house! Originally started with 3 caps 3 times a day. Got reckless and bumped up dosages for a while when I started writing my fiction novel, and it did exactly what I wanted it to do.

At one point, it got out of hand...about 30 - 50 caps a day. The worst was when I had a case of shingles in fall 2018... consistent 50 caps daily for a week or two. Took a few months to get down to 5 caps 3 times a day, and by summer of 2019 I got down to the 5 caps 2 times a day that I'm at now. Having my Xanax and tramadol on hand helped me taper down the kratom and I was able to do that WITHOUT increasing my regular medication dosage...sort of a ""three steps forward, one step back"" thing. 

Honestly, I don't have any negative issues. No laziness when it wears off, no cravings, nothing like that. Everything mind/bodywise functions just fine, and that's why I think it's time to quit.

There's no ""benefit"" to me taking Kratom at this point. It doesn't ""boost me"" so much as baselines me. Baseline is my goal.

I know that without knee and back surgery (not ready for that, kiddo is too young for me to be on bedrest and my business is too busy), I'll be on the tramadol. I also know that I'm one of those folks that needs to be on Xanax for my anxiety/stress induced anger. I know I'll be on those meds for a while and I'm fine with that. 

Honestly, I just wanna ditch the Kratom because at such a low dose, I feel there's other ways I can motivate myself. It costs me ""maybe"" 25 bucks every two weeks which is barely a drop in the bucket, but in my mind is still money wasted.

The few days here or there I went without kratom, never more than one day at a time, all I really experienced was a lack of motivation and mild lethargy which while annoying, was something I've found I could manage by adding extra caffeine, skipping THC, and setting up my ""obligations"" in such a way that there was just no way I'd be able to say ""fuck it, I'll do it later"" such a telling my wife ""hey, do NOT let me bail on this""

Tl;dr it's time for me to quit my ""10 caps a day"" habit. Not sure I wanna do CT, so I'm gonna taper down starting Labor Day weekend (next weekend). Any recommendations? What do I have in store? Any supplements or anything I should get ahead of time to make this go smoother? I have plenty of my tramadol and xanax on hand to help ease things, but I do know that replacing one thing with another isn't always the best solution but I do have a bit of experience in that and I'm 100% confident I can use those to help without increasing my dosage or dependence on those substances when it's all said and done.

Thanks for taking the time to read. I look forward to your advice!

Additional edit: I should add that I don't really have an addictive personality or any actual ""psychological"" addiction issues moreso as the physical dependence/withdrawal is what concerns me. I can recognize when something is no longer of benefit and have no problem ceasing, but I also know that withdrawals (especially with kratom and benzos) are absolute hell. I've had a few instances where I had to miss a few Xanax doses due to being out of town unexpectedly when my prescription ran out without being able to fill it ahead of time...36 hours after the first miss dose really turns into hell fast.",1

Apologies also for the long post.

I was a real drug addict doing several hundreds of dollars worth of heroin, cocaine, benzos, and God knows what else together daily for years. I used copious amounts of kratom to quit, sometimes over an ounce per day, and since then have only used kratom and marijuana, on a regular schedule.

For the past 3 years I have been tapering off of kratom at an extremely slow pace. It's almost completely unnoticeable when I lower the dose, in fact, I often feel better when I do so. I started by fixing my dose at 12 size 00 capsules in the morning and 6 at night. I don't actually know how much fits in each capsule (varies by ""strain"" and how you pack it in anyway), but for simplicity's sake, assuming this is 16.8 grams per day. 

I reduced the dose by one capsule at a time, sometimes each week, sometimes not for months, depending on how I was feeling. At some point I switched to size 0 capsules. I'd have to go digging to figure out the pace, but I can tell you at the start of the pandemic last March, I was taking 7 capsules in the morning and 4 at night (size 0), so let's say 7.7 grams.

Since then my taper has accelerated, in no small part because one capsule is now a way greater proportion of the dose than before, and today I just cut back again. Since the doses are so small now, I started mixing in size 1 capsules, so I can taper by 200mg at a time. I now take two size 0 capsules in the morning and two size 1 capsules at night. By the same math, since the proportions of the capsule sizes are known, I assume this is 2.4 grams.

I have the next 5 steps of the taper planned out, to where I take one size 0 capsule in the morning and one size 1 capsule at night, yielding 1.2 grams. Confident I can do this by the end of October.

But now the million dollar question, where do I go from that point? I don't think I could stomach CT even from 1.2g, or function at work. 

Do I cut out the second dose at night (once I reach that stage, then just worry about the morning dose? Do I just buy size 3 capsules and keep going further? Is there anybody here who has actually tapered all the way down to less than 0.3 grams per day before jumping off? Anyone who jumped from \~1 gram per day who can share the experience? And YES, I do notice the one gram that I take, I wouldn't have believed it myself either, not for one second.

My goal here is to never experience any opioid withdrawal again, even in spite of kratom's mildness. I tried CT years ago after tapering down to 6gpd and only lasted about a week.

I know nobody will have a concrete answer, but appreciate whatever input and experience you may have. And hope this story might help someone else also.",3

I take the kratom capsules, About 30 a day. In the past I've tried to just take one less capsule every day, but it's difficult to maintain motivation through a 30-day taper.

I can usually make it through the first week of CT by taking a week off work and being lazy, but as soon as the responsibilities hit I end up going to buy more.

It's like, in those moments, I just don't care. The responsibilities are 'more important' than my health, and I 'need' the kratom in order to be '100%'.

I can brush off the physical symptoms, but the mental battle always gets me.

I started on kratom when I was 20. Before kratom, I was smoking marijuana, taking adderall, and experimenting with other things. Then I found kratom, it was like a god-send at first and I didn’t need anything else. But after 4 years, I’ve realized what it has come to and some slight health issues that have arisen from my use. 

About a year ago, I started upping my dose until I hit 6 gram doses, 4-5 times a day. To the point that I woke up in discomfort and up until I was showered, dressed, and sitting down before I work, that’s all I could thing about was that first dose in the morning. 

I recently went to the doctor and discovered I’m chronically constipated. I’m tired all the time. If allowed to, I sleep for 12-14 hours on the weekends from taking kratom before bed. I think it’s time I finally quit. 

I want to experience what it’s like to feel genuinely happy while sober. I don’t want to rely on kratom to be able to have that rush of feel-good chemicals when doing things that everyone else enjoys. I want to feel clean and finally feel like I am not leaning on something just to enjoy the normal things in life. 

Idk where I’m really going with this but thank you for reading. Again, advice and experiences are welcome. 

Thank you.

Short story. Addicted to opiates then prescribed subs for 5 years. I’m 34 now snd was 7 plus years totally clean with a family and good job now. Had a herniated disc a few months back. Was prescribed lots of vicadin. Tried to get off but after only 4 weeks in ( 2 every 4 hours 10 a day ) … I was surprised to feel withdrawal by 6 pm my first day off.  That was scary. Was I hooked again ? 

Had Tramadol which figured was better.  Was down to about 3 a day.  Not bad.  When I decided to switch to kratom.  Basically I immediately abused it.  Cause I liked it.  It’s been about 2 and a half months total between kratom and opiates. Maybe 6 weeks on kratom. Started about 10 mg a day. Was up to 25 or 30. Felt out of it. So immediately cut to 15 with no problem.  I only dose twice a day. About 7 or 8 am and about 7 pm. 

The tricky part is my panic disorder. For the longest time 1 klonipan a day at night has kept it away. Sometimes even half. .5 mg.  But I’m in a new cycle of having panic attacks. I haven’t really been able to move forward too well from 15g but the anxiety feels unrelated to kratom. 

My only fear in dropping fast is that it will trigger my anxiety. I have already had yo take .5 mg of Xanax several times over the past few weeks to calm down panic attacks.  Benzos haven’t been a huge problem for me so if I have to use them while cutting kratom hard I wouldn’t be against that. 

It hasn’t even been that long on these opiates and opiate like substances so I would really like to immediately cut to 5 and 5.  And then get to 3 and 3 asap where I feel less out of it. 

Has anyone here tapered and suffered with anxiety or panic disorder ? 

I’ve dealt with tapering off opiates before but not while simultaneously navigating panic attacks.  

Any encouragement or help appreciated.

I’m waking up every day at 5am and really struggle to get back to sleep, I’m so uncomfortable. I have the restless legs all day every day until I take some k. Insane temperature disregulation - I can have freezing feet and a sweating core at the same time. Sweater on, sweater off, blanket on, blanket off, every 5 minutes. But starting around lunchtime, 20 hours since last dose, those symptoms start to get unbearable. Once I dose, they disappear. Obvious withdrawal. 

I’m planning to be fully off k by next weekend, meaning I will have tapered for a three weeks. Is that too short a timeframe for tapering to even make a difference? Or when I’m done after 3 weeks, will it feel just like cold turkey would? Of course, I know I could taper for months and really reduce withdrawals - but I just want to be done with this stuff. 

Aside from anything physical, I do think tapering has made a big difference mentally. This process has given me a lot of confidence to get this shit out of my life.

It was good at that but made me into a zombie. Bought into the same BS as so many of us (natural, non-addictive, similar to coffee). After a spectacular blowout with my wife i quit drinking and smoking for good on August 1 and kept taking Kratrom to ease into sobriety. Realized I was lying to myself that I was sober while still taking 10-15gpd. Decided that I would do a taper with the 25grams I had left. Finished my bag on Friday so now I’m free. 

Thankfully I started marathon training after I stopped drinking so I have a habit going for training which is helping with the withdrawal symptoms. So tired of feeling like I have a head cold.

Obv I'm on the worst day, I've actually been sleeping due to gabapentin however am feeling the physicals and cravings pretty strongly right now, and am supposed to be working (luckily from home). I'm contemplating taking a tiny amount of suboxone, such as .5mg or less, however I know that it's an opioid antagonist and how it works. Would that small amount set me back on my countdown, pushing back the date to starting the LDN? Anyone have exp with this?",1

It started giving me heart problems so I decided to quit. I was taking about 4 spoonfuls everyday around 3pm and 5pm. I was able to taper down to 2 1/2 spoons before quitting but, the withdrawals are still there. The first day of no Kratom was fine but was really weird when I didn take it after work that day. The second day I felt achy and depressed and couldn’t concentrate on anything. Day 3 isnt so bad for the physical withdrawals but the depression is really kicking in, I have no motivation for anything. Feels like a dementor has sucked out my soul. I’m sure this will get easier as the days go on. I just want to be happy again and not feel like a shell of myself. Going home and taking Kratom was like my end of the day treat. I could’ve had the crappiest day at work and Kratom always made it better. I still smoke weed but, it’s not doing anything but getting me high. It gives me a head change but doesn’t make me any happier. It’s sucks. I’m hopeful about the future but damn, I really can’t wait to feel normal again. I have the next 3 days off so, im gonna force myself to workout and do some cardio, Ik that helps with releasing endorphins and dopamine in the brain so, im really hoping that’ll help this lifeless feeling. I’m a music producer as well. I’ve been on a pretty good roll but, as of rn I have no motivation to do anything and music doesn’t sound the same anymore.

So here I am again. About 2 weeks ago I quit and made it 7 days and was feeling fine. I ended up doing kratom again, and it’s been a cycle. Do it for 3-5 days straight, quit for 2-3 days, do it for 3 days straight, quit for two. I’m hoping that since I haven’t used the past two weeks straight, these withdrawals will be more manageable. My use wasn’t too high. And honestly, a gram and a half is enough for me. I prefer the extract shots, but if I do regular leaf, 1.5-2 grams is my sweet spot.

Sleeping all day, constantly being constipated and bloated . I’ve actually gained about 30lbs on Kratom and I use to be in great shape. Fast forward to now and two weeks from quitting and I’m having the most amazing time on vacation ( well I was ). I am walking, I am socializing, I am having sex with my BF ( now ex ) , I am getting to know him even more. I woke up at 6am to catch sunrise, and cried it was so beautiful. If I was on Kratom I would of slept til noon, dosed and felt numb for the rest of the day. My WD stoped around day 10-11 thank god. So I am able to present. 

Then my BF at the time told me he didn’t love me like how he use to love me. That’s this time we’ve been back together since I’ve been sober, he hasn’t really been here. That he doesn’t want to 100% be with me. I just started balling crying. This guy I thought was my soulmate and I ruined our relationship because of drugs and alcohol. I got so angry. Why did you come on vacation with me ? Why are you telling me you love me? Why are you letting me spend all my money on you? I am mostly sad because I ruined another relationship because of my addiction. He doesn’t even really want to be here with me. Wish he was somewhere else probably or with someone else. I feel used and I am embarrassed, that I didn’t see the signs. Also dude why tell me on vacation, I’ve just been crying all day and night. 

I say that to say. I still will NOT USE KRATOM. It’s okay to feel pain, heartbreak, sorrow. It’s okay to feel devastated and cry. It’s okay to be angry and heartbroken. Emotions are things you feel when you’re sober. I am embracing the pain. This person is my best friend and my BF. So I’m losing two things. I feel used, used for my money and not for love. And dude why tell me now ? Smh. But I will not use. I will not go back to hell. I will be alone and I will get through this. Kratom will not comfort me, it will only make me feel worse. And most of all, nobody will make me relapse. I will not let anyone have that power over me. We Have to spend the rest of the day here and then we fly out and go our separate ways. If I can stay sober through this, so can you. You got this",26

I am noticing a pattern on this sub... A lot of us suffer from anxiety/depression (duh.) I can't be the only one who was also taking SSRIs on top of kratom. I am still taking 40mg citalopram (celexa generic) daily. I am wondering if there is a relationship between peoples' experience with PAWs and whether they took SSRIs during their kratom habit. On one hand, maybe the SSRIs will help mitigate these symptoms. On the other hand, maybe my body is adjusted to such a high dose of citalopram that I will experience PAWs as if I wasn't taking SSRIs. It makes me cringe now knowing that kratom may also have SSRI-type properties- my poor 🧠

However I am deep in my studies and need to do well this year. What do I do?","So long story short I've had an on and off kratom problem for the past four and a half years. I got hooked during the spring of 2017, quit in January 2018, got back on kratom again in april of 2018 and was hooked until finally tapering off by Nov 1 2019. Was clean until October 2020 and was fully hooked again by February 2021. I've had many chances to quit since then but me, being the horrible procrastinator that I am, kept putting it off until its too late to quit before it can affect my responsibilities i.e. school, work etc. 
Currently I take about 81 grams a week. In addition to the Kratom, I am also prescribed 30 mg IR Adderall. On days I don't take Adderall I take three doses of three grams each in a single day for a total of 9 grams. But when I take Adderall I lose all control and can take upwards of 30 grams. The problem is that I have become reliant on Adderall to do my school work. While this has definitely helped me get good grades, I find my mental health slipping as I grow more paranoid, I barely go out and socialize anymore and don't show any interest in anything unless I'm on Adderall. Essentially off the Adderall all I do is sleep, eat and ocassionally go out, and when I take Adderall I do get all my work done and enjoy my hobbies (reading, writing etc) but take shitloads of kratom. I'm getting fed up and want to quit but fear that if I quit than it will ruin my semester. In the past when I quit or tapered during the school year my grades dropped significantly and I nearly flunked out before as a result. I basically feel stuck between two choices:

1. Continue taking kratom and Adderall, and do well in school but fall further into addiction, or
2. Quit and watch my grades suffer and potentially flunk out, again. 

Another issue is that I am afraid that by quitting kratom that I will stop enjoying my hobbies and lose the parts of my personality that make me unique (I am a huge naturalist, I write short stories and enjoy reading about prehistoric life). The last time I got sober I basically became a border line roided out douchebag who abused the shit out of supplements, cared too much about being cool and was completely unhappy with my life. When I get sober, I lose all my interests and try to play catch up to everyone else, instead of actually doing what I enjoy. But on kratom I am lazy, compulsive and reliant on Adderall. 

I really don't know what to do. I am afraid that if I hold off on quitting until after the semester I will get complacent and hold off on quitting until the next semester starts. I was thinking that maybe I see a substance abuse counselor in the mean time and plan ahead so that I'll be ready when the semester ends. 

So any advice? Also what is the best way to quit without expiriencing debilitating PAWS? I was thinking of doing a very slow taper, but the Adderall complicates this (I binge on kratom whenever I take Adderall).",2

I did that for a couple week on and off and then started up in full force doing more per day then I've ever done. Even got the spins and threw up lol. 

Withrawaling is the fucking worst, I want to be out hiking and enjoying summer but I'm laying in bed fucking shaking with anxiety. I told myself I wouldn't get to this point, and now the past few weeks have been a game of trying to figure out what the best time to quit is so I minimize the chance of fucking up my life.

I'm pissed at the shop I got it from, I was only buying a small amount at a time and they knew why, cause I'm a fiend. And they still always tried to get me to buy more. Fuck that and them. 

Life has been kicking my ass and while kratom was helping me I know that to truly things around I need to be me. I can't meditate on kratom, journal, I don't care about music. Those are all the things that keep me sane. 

I personally think that PAWs is all the feelings you've been ignoring while on kratom coming back to you all at once. Can't avoid it and have to move through it, and hopefully find out from yourself why you're depressed and what's missing. 

I've noticed that of the times I've quit, I only get cravings when I'm not ready to quit. But when I'm ready I don't get cravings. My body fucking hurts but no way I'm doing day 1 over again.

Anyway thanks for my ramble and hope everyone is having an okay time.",8

I also never did anything without being on kratom so I started only doing my small doses when I didn’t have anything to do. I made myself work, workout, and do chores without it so I can learn to be without it. It’s helped A LOT. I now don’t find myself unhappy or bored doing my normal mundane tasks every day.

I jumped 60% and over one week went to 84%.   I have been at 16gpd split into 4 doses for a week now, never cheating and always absolutely forcing myself to make it at least four hours between doses, usually five hours, sometimes 6 and usually at least eight hours at night.  However, over this week it is now much harder to last four hours than when I first lowered to this plateau. I thought the opposite was supposed to happen.  Is it that my withdrawal from the 100gpd is finally catching up to me after these two weeks?  I have 5 days before I CT with 5 days off.  Should I taper more or stay at 16gpd?  I hope 5 days is enough.  I'm hoping by that point that keeping my mind busy at work will be beneficial.

One cool thing is I get to do a lot of tests of different supplements since I'm basically going into strongish withdrawal every 5 hours.  I'm pretty proud I haven't cheated, yet.

Edit: since my original reason for quitting urgently seems to be dissipating (kidney or bowels issue -- had blood in urine and pain for weeks), I am considering continuing to taper.  I think this isn't an excuse because I've been able to stick with the taper schedule.  However, maybe I should at least try to quit coming up here.  I'd be down a couple hundred (maybe 400) dollars in supplements if I fail (again).",1

I usually make excuses and then take a big dose when things get stressful at work or home. At first, I used kratom to help me stop drinking and it worked like a charm. Whenever I felt the urge to drink, I would take a nice dose (at the time about 6 grams would do it). After about a year, I felt completely dependent on it and had a 3 times a day habit for a while. I would slip every once in a while and have a long evening of alcohol binging which would lead to a stressful hangover. So I eventually quit drinking altogether and have been clean from alcohol for 1.5 years at the moment.   


So about a week ago, I finally decided to call it quits and rid myself of the habit. I have been taking 27 grams daily for a really long time. I've lost all euphoria and added energy. It's a hard thing for me...I like feeling motivated and feeling energetic and focused... so I did a very fast taper. 9 grams, 3 times a day turned in to 4.5 grams 3 times a day and kept cutting my daily use in half. Today I did 0.7 grams 3 times. It seems silly at this point to even take such a small amount. So tomorrow is the day I will stop hopefully for good.. The lack of self control has always been a problem but I am pretty sure I can do this. Thanks /r/quittingkratom for all your great posts.",6

A few of you have been a God send… I feel a lot better today. i was able to work, hanging with my daughter, be a nice person today, lol.

I had chills- but they were ok with me ❤️ Senses are coming back, trying to force food still, taking vitamins, trying to eat healthy, moving (either walk the dogs or work out or JUST MOVE AROUND) Someone told me- do jumping jacks til you can’t anymore- even… cold shower… Listen I was so worried I wasn’t going to be able to do this.. I am so GRATEFUL I took the plunge. I see the hope. I see what i’ve been missing. The whiteness in my eyes is coming back. My spirit is coming alive again. My personality is coming back in full swing. I can’t wait to see what each day will bring. Life is beautiful and way  too short- no matter how old  you are.

Need advice on unexpected taper effects.,So I’ve been lurking here for a while and this is my first post. I’ve been taking Kratom for about 3 to 4 years my highest has been 16 GPD. I started feeling withdraws in between doses so I knew it was time to taper. I’ve gotten off opiates and subs in the past so I knew cold turkey wasn’t for me. So long story short I got all the way down to 12 GPD over the past week and suffered through some very mild withdraws. But I’ve been really trying my best to stretch out my doses at least five hours and I do it four times a day at 3g. I woke up last night at 4:30 AM with the restless legs and cry skin so decided to take my morning dose a little early. I went to work after I got up and decided I was going to hold out as long as I could. I’ve taken one walk all my supplements that I have been starting and just went for a walk/run to try and get the endorphins going. Long story short I sit here over 13 hours after my last dose and after I just ran and besides a headache I don’t feel bad. I’m trying to hold off as much as I can but I would’ve already taken my third dose by now. I know this probably won’t last long but what the heck is going on? For the record I am trying everything to try and beat this. I’m embracing any pain and started Wim Hof breathing. Anyone ever experienced similar?,3
2021-08-27 17:20:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/pcwe3h/tips_for_quitting/,Tips for Quitting,"I used Kratom for about 4 or 5 years daily.  At first it was about 2g per day then increased overtime to 20g to 40g per day.  I justified my use because it help me with an alcohol abuse problem.  When using Kratom your still able to function unlike when your drunk, so I was helping myself. Right?  The reason I abuse drugs and alcohol is that I have emotional problems.  Mine stem from disappointment with my life, shame, lack of friends, and a stressful job.  I start feeling a feeling of terror coming over me each day in the evening.  Nothing I could pinpoint just a background feeling of terror or emptiness.  Kratom helped to numb that feeling. Well, I quit and know that I will never use it again and here is my advice to anyone else that wants to quit and fill the void in their soul.

1. I found a good church and joined a small group where they share their daily struggles.  It really helps to understand how much everyone else is struggling too.  And then understand that we struggle together.
2. I fasted from eating anything other than drinking water for three days for the intiatial cold turkey quit. I was hungry but was thinking about food and not Kratom.  Then I would intermittent fast till 12 PM or 4 PM.  Again, I was hungry but had less withdrawals and cravings.
3. I started taking long walks each evening, like for 2 hours.  It helps blow off steam and it helps with insomnia and restless legs.  My legs would hurt and twitch all night and I could not sleep.  Longs walks eliminated it 100%.
4. I kept thinking about my 17 year old daughter and realized time is running out.  I only have one year left with her before she goes to college.  I need to be present.
5. I can't drink alcohol.  I will just lose the self control and take kratom.
6. I realized that I was not strong enough to quit on my own.  So, I gave my heart to God and prayed"" God, I am not strong enough to do this, but let your will be done in my life"".

I been guarding my heart from another injury for so long that I can barely feel love for anyone anymore. And I have been filling this void in my soul with substances for decades.  But, I found a better way and I never want to be separated from God's love again.  Knowing this love,

The cravings are gone

The terror is gone

The shame and disappointment are gone

My is heart opening again to everyone

My family is restored

My life is restored

Coincidentally, right around the same time, my doctor prescribed me LDN for something else, so I decided to try out ULDN until I'm done kicking the kratom.

I've read every single thread with the word ULDN in it at least twice, but I'm looking to hear more about the experiences of those who used it to taper.  

Specifically:

* What dosage and timing worked for you?
* How did you find your sweet spot?
* Did it take a while to start working or did you notice a difference right away?

I've read lots of reports of people saying it helped them take less kratom, and/or extend their time between doses but so far I haven't really noticed a difference.  After reading all the threads here on ULDN, I started at 2 mcg about 30 mins before each dose.  Then I upped it to 5 mcg when I didn't notice a difference.  Then 10, now I'm at 15 mcg but I don't notice anything.  So I'd love to hear the detailed experiences of those who used ULDN to assist them in their taper.  TIA!",1

I used Kratom to quit of course. I did feel better, wasn’t as bloated and didn’t really get a high from the Kratom, so I thought it was harmless. 

Like I’ve mentioned in other posts, I truly believe Kratom would’ve worked IF I would’ve stopped Kratom after one week of use when getting off the pills…but hey we’re addicts so that’s not typically in our nature. 

So after 5 years of daily Kratom use, maxing at 7 grams in the morning and 8 grams in the evening here I am. 

Today is 3 weeks of no Kratom for me, I went CT for the most part (meaning I did take one Tylenol 3 at night on days 3 and 5). Over these past 3 weeks I’ve learned that Kratom is much more of a mental withdrawal than the lower grade pain pills. I’m talking mood swings like I’ve never experienced. With Vicodin and Norco it seemed like a purely physical withdrawal, and while Kratom does present the physical unpleasantries too my head has been all over the place.

I was thinking at 3 weeks I’d be much better, the first week was more physically painful, but it was mentally odd. During that week I had some depression BUT then I also had spurts of happiness too. Now at week 3 it’s pretty much all depression and fatigue. It’s almost like week 3 has been more challenging than the first week, anyone else feel this way? At least in the first week some occasional joy would wash over me. 

Maybe I can handle the pain more than the emotional aspects of PAWS? At what point could it just be me? When I was younger I was depressed, but having done pills and Kratom for so long I don’t even remember who I really am without a substance in my system. 

So just curious if anyone else has struggled at week 3 like this?",8

On 23rd of August 2020, I quit kratom for good, I struggled with that thing for almost 4 years.

Those years are a blur to me. But I managed to power through and thanks to this community and encouragement I was able to stay on the right path and never looked back.

I had many urges to relapse, couple months ago I was drinking by myself and had emotional breakdown from my depression. It all passed and now I feel better than ever.

I started like everyone else, I fell for ""all natural"", ""its like coffee"" bs. I used it mainly for work / Im an artist/ and it really helped me to work longer hours, but it lost its magic very quickly. 

I used to be low doser, had rules, that I never live up to. I would take up to 5 gpd, but had a couple months of up to 10 gpd. Even though the dosage was small, I dosed 3-4 times a day, I was in a constant kratom high, the physical symptoms passed quickly, but my psychological dependency was very strong, it was very hard to resist another dose. 

I would get mad if I wasted my ""high"" doing something else, or if I dosed too high and got nauseous, my day would be ruined. I became hermit, I was avoiding people, I had more anxiety than before, my skin got really bad, hair thinned out combined with hereditary hairloss, it probably sped up the process.

I barely think about it nowadays, I have no urge to buy it, or use it

Its all behind me now, and **I really wish everyone else to stay strong, you can do it!** I thought I cant, I tried like 4 times... You helped me a lot and I really thank you for your time.",34

2021-08-27 13:24:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/pcrumo/unusual_withdrawal_symptoms/,Unusual withdrawal symptoms,"I quit CT about 2 weeks ago from about a 6gpd for a year habit (weekly use before that for about 2 years). I’ve always had restless leg and undiagnosed reynauds (cold extremities). 

Since stopping I’ve noticed slight numbness, accompanied by pretty noticeable pins and needles feeling in my hands and feet, sort of radiating up my calves and forearms nonstop. This is accompanied by fairly frequent and aggressive muscle twitches as well as pretty tough light sensitivity/ eye pain if I look at my phone for too long.

Due to RLS sleeping has been hell so I cracked twice about a week apart and took .5g dose and didn’t really notices a cease in this symptom apart from being able to fall asleep and if anything it actually got a little worse the morning after each dose.

I’ve seen a fair amount of posts about this but none recently and no follow ups to see if theses symptoms actually went away. Most people that have actually experienced say that it is definitely the kratom, but the ones that haven’t seem to try and send the OPs off to a neurologist.

I will worry about the slippage once I can get clean again, but for now I need recommendations about how the hell to stop without feeling like I’m dying at work. 

Fortunately I’m only at around 25 g per day, whereas before I had a 50g+ daily habit. However, when I cut back to 10g per day I was already feeling the withdrawals and couldn’t get any sleep. My first thought is this: have any of you used suboxone to stop? I was thinking if I take subs for 4-5 days then the kratom would be mostly out of my system and I wouldn’t be physically dependent on the subs yet. Thoughts on that? I’ve tried a similar method with bensos but that was while I didn’t have work, and I can’t be barred out at my job. Also I had heard someone say that they’ve used adderall to curb WDs… anyone had success with that? Any other tips? As a last resort I could take a week off and dry out at home, or even go to a 7 day detox, but these options are extremely unattractive since my parents and partner are fed up with my constant relapse.

Right now I’m at 25gpd and want to cut down on overall tapering time by immediately cutting my dosage in half. I realize this will cause some uncomfortable withdrawal feelings but I would assume that in a matter of days(?) your body would adjust and symptoms would somewhat go away. From there I can go on a more regimented tapering plan. 

If I were to cut my dosage per day from 25 to 12 and stuck at 12 until I felt relatively ok, how bad would the withdrawal effects be in the short term, and how long would it take the body to adjust? 

I realize everyone is different but just looking for ballpark expectations from someone who has done this?  Is the withdrawal so bad that I might as well go cold turkey? Does it take 2 weeks to level out?

FWIW, I cut from 25 to 20g for the first time yesterday, and I’m definitely feeling minor withdrawals. Not enough to affect my day but I can tell they are there and it’s making me wonder if dropping to 12 will be very harmful.",2

With the wide range of symptoms, take that ONE out, and this would probably be much lighter and easier. I can’t sit still and it feels like my skin is sort of burning mildy not hurting me but giving me a massive urge to move around and not sleep. When the days over it feels like it went quick but during the day it’s a little tough to scratch and claw for hope. But with each day comes just a little more improvement. I’m at least 60% physically better than I was before, and the physical symptoms were 100% the ones keeping me failing to quit. I know PAWS is coming and it’s a bitch, but I’m familiar with the sensation of a complete lack of dopamine and serotonin, it’s god awful but right now I’d take anything in place for this muscle and bone pain. I won’t take my prescribed amphetamines because I feel like that’s not teaching my brain to motivate itself with dopamine and build it’s own naturally. Anyway this too long. Back later",6

1st- my brain had been in such a fog I couldn’t accurately calculate my sobriety date. Thought today was day 6… nope it’s 5. Good news!!! On day 5 I can do basic arithmetic. Joy

Background: 44yr old male, 2 amazing kids (17 -girl, 19-boy/man) 6’1”, 200lb average to slightly above average fitness (currently well below average). Former fight pilot in the USAF. 

Symptoms up till now:
Extremely unmotivated, lethargic and not sleeping more than 2-3 hrs a night. I stick to a routine: close my eyes for 15 minutes if still not sleeping get up, drink a glass of water, go to bathroom (been drinking a ton of water to flush system) then go back and lay down and repeat. This helps me keep my mind under control. Sweat like crazy at night. I love this as it’s my bodies way of regenerating. On day 3 I went for a run outside.  It was terribly pathetic but I did it. Extreme brain fog and memory recall until this morning. More on this later.

List of supplements taken chronological order (AM-PM):
-thyroid meds (I am hypothyroid)
-Agmatine, L-Theanine,  Balance of nature (3hrs later) 
-GABA (3hrs later)
-magnesium as required (for RLS)
-water water and more more water! I pee every 30 min. 
-Meletonin at night
-magnesium at night 
-Pray, meditate, stay active (work, Reddit, walks, bath, shower, talking to friends etc.) 

Day 5 wake up: wow, slept 7 hours. Feel 50% better than yesterday. Will be able to get things done, workout and maybe enjoy a few things ????

I told myself to do something new today so I hope that my rant helps someone.  I have found that during this time helping others has been more therapeutic than I could have ever imagined.  Maybe the realization that helping others is actually helping myself was the epiphany I needed.  

Forgetting actually how to live is the scariest experience once you realize what you were dulled to while on Kratom.  The stress and anxiety of realizing that these emotions you stopped feeling were here again and something had to be done about them!  Once the phys WD subsided I was just assaulted with emotions, smells, music, creativity bursts, and uncertainty and doubt (had to throw some of the negs in there) This veil began lifting and my brain was just on rapid fire all the good all the bad.  Shutting the negative emotions down is hard-work.  I used breath work and meditation.  Your mileage may vary but it was a tremendous help.  So was magnesium and vitC along with cold exposure.

I would have not been able to structure my sobriety near as well without this sub and I just want to share love and appreciation to everyone here.  I will never be out of the woods but 5yrs of K use taught me more about myself than I could have ever done sober.  It was a learning experience and I had to strip my soul for bare to realize how much I took myself for granted.  I had to forgive me! For my fellow travelers It does get better! It will get better! We got this! Love and Light",7

I was taking ~10gpd for about 6 months and instead of quitting then due to issues I was having I stupidly decided to move to extracts. At its peak I was taking 4g of leaf during the day (at about 2pm) and 1.5 bottles of extracts at 10pm. I’m hoping the fact that I only take 2 doses a day and ~85% of my daily intake is taken at one time will make things a little easier (aka I wasn’t taking every 4 hours every day)

Well I was spending so much money that I was scared to check my disposable income bank account and today I found out that this money is gone. So unless I sell my house or something I am done with this. But I’m in a pure panic right now as I just started a new job and am worried that I’m going to be unable to function for the next 2 months. I can probably buy a couple hundred capsules to taper but I still have to get off the extracts. 

I have 3 bottles of extract left. I am taking 1 tonight, 0.75 tomorrow, 0.5 Saturday and 0.5 Sunday and 0.25 Monday. I may supplement with powder to keep the edge off. But I know I have to pay the Piper and I’ve been completely shocked that this is happening. I know I’ve needed to stop taking for awhile now but having it hit me like this unexpected and having to be forced into facing my demons absolutely sucks. I’m not ready for this but here goes anyways…


I’ve heard of taking a ton of vitamin C, I’ve heard of black seed oil, kava, cbd, magnesium. Any other supplements you can recommend to lessen the physical symptoms is appreciated. I have a couple of things for the mental stuff (tyrosine, 5htp, Phenibut) for now.",3

Been here many times before. My latest relapse turned into a monster that spiraled further than I ever thought possible.

Ive been through 6 or 7 rough CT withdrawals. They were no fun. At all. (duh). This one is a different animal. My usage combined with the extracts put me way higher in overall consumption than I ever was before. By day 6 in the past, I'd at least have a shred of something to hold onto. Not this time. I feel absolutely awful.  

In the past, my withdrawal would peak around 36 hours and start to turn downward around day 5. This time it was full bore within 24 hours and hasn't let up one bit. My mental status is deteriorating and I haven't had ONE second of comfort or relief. I can't sit, I can't stand, I just pace. Working out like an animal and having chills and akathisia 10 minutes later. That used to not only bring some relief but a few minutes of peace upstairs. 

I knew going into this I was fucked. I made journal notes to remind myself whatever I experience will be temporary and to hold on tight. Logically, I know this. But the fear is so powerful this time. I'm so dissociated, can barely walk without bumping into everything, almost pass out every time I stand up, have chills almost nonstop, rls that is indescribable. I am dead upstairs. I feel nothing. At all. I am losing hope.  I can't fake anything around anyone. 

I don't want to check into a facility. I probably should have. One thing is for sure, though. I will never, ever touch this shit again. It has the power to eat you from the inside out if you chase it. 

Just needed to tell someone. I feel like a failure, an awful father, an awful husband, and I can't believe how far down I've gone the past few years. 

I definitely rambled a bit there. Just need to feel some connection. Keep fighting, everyone.",51

Figure I'll probably be close to 100% better in another month. I've been trying to just stay in doors go to the gym and avoid going out and partying or doing anything that would make me feel worse.

I used to only use it once a month, if even that, but now I have a problem. I started a new job working in retail exactly a year ago today and that's when the usage became an all day everyday thing. It started out with smaller amounts, but quickly turned into larger doses. My job can be very stressful, so I've been using it to cope with dealing with all of the customers and the heavy lifting that goes into it. My supervisor, who has become like a father figure to me also takes it, even more than I do, so among the many things we have in common, that is another. Him being here to help me and kratom were the 2 things keeping me from quitting at the start, but he got covid, a really bad case of it and hasn't been to work in over 2 weeks. I've been checking up on him, but I'm not sure if he will make it back. On top of that I now want to quit taking kratom, but I'm worried I won't be able to function at work without it. It doesn't really have an effect anymore and I want to quit CT. I already tried recently, didn't take any on my 2 days off and felt like shit and couldn't eat, so I caved and started taking it again. My plan is to give my 2 weeks notice, so that I don't leave on bad terms and can potentially come back when I'm done with withdrawals if I don't get another job. I have enough money saved up to survive for an entire year, I just don't know if I want to make that big of a commitment, but I do know that I want to be done with kratom forever. Funny part is, I was never into opioids/ opiates when I was younger in my teenage years. I was solely taking it to cope with work. I know some people are going to ask how much I was and or am taking. I truly don't know exactly because my supervisor and i were dumping it straight out of the bag into work tickets and washing it down with water. If I had to estimate, I'd say at the peak I was probably taking around 30 to 40 GPD, now it's more like 20 to 30 GPD, but again, I truly don't know because of my method of taking it. Anyhow, I'd love to hear what you guys think I should do in this situation. Momentarily leave my job (were short staffed and no one wants to work because of the whole covid thing, so they'd probably hire me back given the circumstance) and live off of my savings for the duration of withdrawals or figure something else out.",3

I've been on a low dose of kratom for about 2.5 years - generally 3g-6g total per day (spread over 4-5 <1g doses) depending on my stress levels.For the last 6 months, I've felt ready to quit, because my mental health and lifestyle has improved so much that I knew I definitely didn't need the kratom, and I have a tolerance so I rarely even felt the kratom anymore, but I've just been afraid of the withdrawal. I've been under the weather with a stomach bug this week, so I realized yesterday that meant I had begun an accidental taper - only about 1G-2G per day since Saturday, so maybe it was time to be brave and stop completely. I took my last half a gram at 6am on Wednesday (first and only dose of the day). I had some uncomfortable hot flashes Wednesday early evening and slight restless leg syndrome at bedtime, but I still slept 6 hours and today woke up feeling totally normal. 

Fingers crossed - I think that might have been the sum total of my withdrawal??? I haven't felt any symptoms since yesterday evening and it's been 36 hours since my last dose. I wanted to post because I wish I had known withdrawal could be this painless when coming off a low dose. If I had, I would have stopped months ago!",2

Today I start tapering to quit… again. I’m effing DONE. Right now I’m taking 30ish gpd with an average of 1 dose per day around 50. It’s been about 7 months now. I’m a mess and full of shame. Anxiety, mood swings and irritability have been through the roof for months. Been unemployed for the duration and am so very grateful to have my partner’s unconditional support. If I were her I’d have been gone a long time ago. We moved from Houston to the Seattle area 2 months ago and I don’t know how the hell I got through that with her working and me doing the entire move. Very proud of myself for persevering so many times throughout that process. 

Did 30 days inpatient in early 2014 for alcohol (mainly) and haven’t touched it since. It was… bad. Went back to the same facility in late 2016 after 6 months of kratom at 100 gpd.  I had severe withdrawal symptoms, mostly RLS which was unbearable at times and glad I was receiving around the clock medical care.  It would have been suicide for me if I would have quit cold turkey without meds etc. 

Just bought a scale to make sure I’m at least a little accurate and also got some ibuprofen, magnesium, loperamide to try out. About to do a bit more research and lay out a taper schedule.  I have a lot of activities in mind to help me through this like hiking, riding my bike, meditation, binaural beats and music. 

So yeah I’ll shut up now. I’m ready for this and I WILL succeed.  Hope y’all don’t mind me leaning on you. Any and all advice or encouragement is welcome. I appreciate all of you for sharing your experience and I’ll do my best to share mine. I promise my posts won’t be this long in the future. Stay the course, do the next right thing. Much love♥️",6

I want to get to the Good fist for all of those souls out there trying to get through this fight.

**The Good**

*Chills/Goosbumps/Sweats*: This triple threat bothered me for the first 10ish days. For the last 20 or so I only experienced these when work/relationship stresses explode.

*RLS*: This is usually the worst symptom for me. It was realllly bad for the first 20 days. For the last 10 it has been mostly under control, but still have bad RLS moments. Exercise and cannabis have helped a ton.

**The Bad**

After the first two weeks, I started and am still experiencing far more anxiety and/or a feeling of being overwhelmed. Has anyone else noticed this AFTER the acute stage (first two weeks)? It's very disturbing to feel this way. I have 1MG Ativan pills, but don't want to simply switch from K to benzos. Please let me know if this is a symptom and if it will end at some point.

Its now been about 24 hours since then and I am feeling fine except my legs hurt. 

I am worried that say tomorrow or the day after things get worse and I take just a smaller dose of 6g again will this set me back to yesterday or will progress still have been made?

I am hoping it doesn't get like this as I feel the main concern is being unable to sleep which really messes with you. But I have magnesium supplements and plenty of weed to help with that.

I am literally scared to quit, as much as I need and want to. I fully understand that this is ruining my life, but I always seem to justify taking it. I make myself feel better by ""tapering down"", but I'm really not tapering. I'm staying stuck at 10 to 12 gpd. The very thought of quitting completely both excites and overwhelms me. Am I just weaker than most? The only time I seem to be able to motivate myself to stop is when I'm on it. In the mornings when I haven't had a dose since 1:00 the last afternoon, my mind and body are screaming to me to take my morning dose, then by 1 I'm screaming to take my afternoon dose. Then by the time I get home from work, I'm so tired I just sit in front of the television and go to bed before 8. I think a lot of this stems from one day when I didn't take any, and planned to stop CT. That was one of the worst nights I can remember. I had never experienced anxiety and depression like that before. Now I wonder if I can even do this!

Sorry for whining. I just feel so damn stuck this morning. My new plan is to make the jump next Thursday. I'm hoping I can suffer through work on Friday, then I'll have a three day weekend (Labor Day) to lay around the house. Then I'm hoping the worst of it will be over and I'll be able to function at work on Tuesday. That would give me four full days.  I'm also going to research supplements that may help, like mega dosing vitamin C and taking Magnesium or 5HTP for the depression. I want off of this poison, and I will never get myself addicted to anything again. I'm nearly 50 years old, and never have before. I hate this, and I hate myself right now!

The previous two days were terrible, but today I feel much, much better.I was craving stuff a lot worse than Kratom yesterday and the day before. My whole body was anxious and uneasy. Was so hard to get through the day. Also because Kratom masked some of my underlying mental health conditions, I started out using it as kind of medicine, but it backfired. I had the courage to get in touch with some people around me to talk about it, and I refrained from anything but some CBD and a LOT of tea. Tea is my friend.Today, I feel like the worst is over, but I'll probably experience that emptiness and those cravings again. But I did it, and I'm proud of that today.

I've been on kratom pretty short term (4ish months) and I'm just sick of of feeling like shit all the time. I take extracts and just have no self control when it comes to addictions. Prior to finding kratom, i used oxy for probably five years, finally checked into rehab and got clean off the oxy (2019), then relapsed on the oxy a year later in February. Towards the end of April someone told me about kratom to help get off of the pills, and have used daily ever since. I'm so over this though. The best I've felt was that one year i was sober and now i just feel like I'm in a haze all the time. I cant remember anything for shit and i just feel out of it. 
I tried quitting the past 2 day. The first day i felt fine, and then the exhaustion and fatigue and brain fog are what killed me today on day 2. My problem is, i have 2 kids i have to care for while my husband is working so i cant just be exhausted and laying around while my kids run wild. So needless to say, i went and got an extract for today and one for tomorrow and then I'll quit this weekend while my husband is home. So my question is, if Friday is day one, will i be feeling at least half human by Monday? I figured with such short term use, maybe it won't be too terrible",4

I’ve been taking Kratom for about a year now and have been trying to quit for many months with no success. After more relapses than I can count, this quit I was so determined to be free of this substance that is causing me so much pain mentally. Last night, I decided to have a few shots of vodka and some delta 8-THC edibles to celebrate finding a new job. I ended up falling asleep and woke up in a state of delirium and panic that I haven’t experienced since my last time taking psilocybin mushrooms. I was stuck in this intense state of panic and paranoia, and was losing my mind. To keep this short, I managed to get back to sleep but have felt horrible and “out of it” the entire day and haven’t been able to get out of bed (also had to call off work). I have made so many excuses for myself to go and buy some Kratom again in the past, and end up doing it every time whether it’s because I’m hungover or can’t take anymore of the withdrawals. I ALMOST caved today, but I realized that this endless cycle of quitting then relapsing is only going to lead to more pain. One thing this taught me, is I need to be okay with being sober. Many times, people like me who are addicts look for a magic cure-all substance to help the pain, no matter what issue it is you’re currently facing. No such substance exists and if you think you’ve found it, that feeling it provides is so temporary. If you’ve been engulfed in this endless cycle and feel lost like I have, please learn from this account of my experience as I am still learning from it as well. Only time, and determination are going to heal you and help you. Stop looking for a cure-all or something to ease your pain. Instead, search inside yourself for the answers. Learn to be okay with not being okay. Take it in, ask yourself questions, and let sobriety take back the curtain that substances have hung up. Let the light back in. This is a journey with many challenges, but such is life. Focus on every minute you stay sober, and take gratitude in your new-found clarity. I’m not okay, and that’s okay. We will all learn, we will all make mistakes, and we will all heal together. I am very thankful for this community, and I hope that someone can learn from my scary experience last night. Much love to all you warriors out there 💙",13

I was happy and worried when I heard the news 6 days ago. But here I am 2 days into having our 3rd one at home and I feel worse today than day 2 or 3 of my CT quit from 30gpd 2 years. The cravings are intense. I took a week off work to stay home with the new one and I absolutely regret it. My wife’s being all stressed and naggy and my 2 other children who I spend all my spare time with expect me to be how I use to be, super energetic, playful, and happy. I have my son begging me to play Minecraft with him, my daughter following me everywhere and my wife asking if I have even changed a diaper yet. (No I haven’t). I’m the bread winner and my wife hasn’t worked in the past 5 years that’s her job and she pushed SO hard to have a 3rd kid. To be clear I do absolutely want a third kid but I didn’t play with baby dolls as a kid for Christ sake. I’m parenting the other 2, making dinner, taking one to school, cleaning etc... Then this dog is downstairs (her relentless choice) and all it wants to do is play fetch and chew shit up. I’m overwhelmed, my energy is about where you’d assume it is. 

I then think back to when I used kratom and I honestly can’t even name 3 things it negatively effected. I’ve come on here everyday since my quit to keep me motivated, I’ve listen to advice, I exercise, I do all the vitamins, breathing techniques but here I am about to snap and buy some. My last resort is CBD gummies which I’m going to go buy after dinner. I’m trying to fake it till I make it but I’ve just about had it. My reasons for quitting are just not holding up. 

I GENUINELY enjoyed playing barbies with my daughter, playing with dragon ball z action figures with my son or throwing a ball around. But now it’s painful to even think about playing their childish games. I hate this so much.",7

I had a heavy (30/50g daily) habit for a long time. Quit for three months after I got out of rehab - I was there mostly for alcohol - but quickly relapsed on kratom although I haven’t touched alcohol for almost three years for which I’m eternally grateful. Then I quit for a month cold turkey when I had to tour Australia which was pretty brutal mentally. Again relapsed quickly upon my return to the states.

A little over a year ago I was so sick of the cycle that I dosed myself with Naltrexone hours after I’d last used kratom. I HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU DO NOT DO THIS. What followed was so awful that I ended up in the psych ward. Twice. The physical withdrawal symptoms were horrific but the mental was even worse. I am bipolar so I’m not saying this will happen to everyone, but let me tell you - precipitated kratom withdrawal was the worst drug related experience of my entire life. Physically and mentally.

When I got out of the psych ward for the second time I received a vivitrol shot. The first week after I left was hellish - the cravings were insane, my depression horrific, and the knowledge that I couldn’t use or drink even if I wanted to was truly terrifying. I was in hell. But then I started to get better. Within two weeks of being sober I started feeling REALLY GOOD. That was over a year ago. I’ve been receiving monthly vivitrol injections since then and minus one little slip I’ve been sober ever since. I stopped the vivitrol injections a few months ago but have plenty of oral naltrexone to get me through if cravings start up.

Since then I’ve I taught myself piano. I traveled to LA to do my first ever standup show. I toured (less than normal due to COVID). I recorded a new album. I fell in love. My relationship with my daughter (she is a toddler) has been so wonderful. The ability to be present is such a gift, even if it feels hard sometimes. I always thought it was such bullshit when people told me that it gets better and that you can get through it and that the bad part doesn’t even last that long - but it’s true. I’m happy to answer any questions anyone has about this. I love y’all",39

First time poster here. I am getting ready to start the second half of my taper after a big jump (cut my consumption in half from 4 tablespoons per day to 2) and just wondering if I can get some help estimating how much I was and am currently taking. I should have funds in a few days to get a scale and I know from reading this forum precision is important with my taper and I guess I’m just trying to get a baseline. Google tells me a tablespoon is about 15 grams but that seems like a lot as it would take me between 7-8 weeks to finish 1000g order from my supplier during my years at 4 tablespoons per day. If google is correct that would put me at 60 gpd previously and 30 now which doesn’t add up as I would have gone through 1000g much faster at 60 gpd. Sorry if this violates any forum rules just curious and want to keep my momentum going with my taper and quit this stuff for good, thanks in advance.",2

The first couple of weeks were very difficult for me in terms of cravings and withdrawal symptoms, but after that, I felt great! A big shift for me was my eating patterns, while I was on kratom, I'd eat a meal or two each day, but end up throwing it up, so my total calorie intake was very low. This lifestyle kept my weight low, and I loved the control of being able to take large doses of kratom and know I'd throw up everything I had eaten (sorry if this grosses some of you out lol). I had an eating disorder as a child, and I think my kratom use was masking an eating disorder I was in denial of having. Now that I have returned to normal eating patterns, I have gained some weight. It's stressing me out and all the negative feelings I had about my body as a child/early teen, are returning. I'm feeling out of control and trying to remind myself that food is necessary for having a healthy body (which was one of the main reasons I quit kratom in the first place). I'm trying hard not to go back to kratom, I keep having thoughts like ""what if I just bought one ounce, used for a week or two just to lose the weight I gained after quitting, and then stopped using"". I know myself, and logically this would not work because I know this will send me right back into addiction. I'm just wondering if anyone else used kratom in this way, and has been able to recover, or just is in the same boat because I feel crazy and alone in this situation.",1

Man I don't know if this is normal or if my neuropathy is making me worse in withdrawals.  But this is day 9 and I am worse than ever.  My legs the nerves are firing like crazy. I was taking Delta 8 but it dopes me up so much during the day even though I took it the night before I just feel worse.  I am not eating just doing my protein drink and drinking lots of water 3 liters a day but otherwise I am so nauseated.  I am so tearful and over-emotional.  I am burning up don't know if that is withdrawals or if it is my thyroid issues.  I am a mess.  I need my mental to cope and I don't have it right now.  I ache all over.  I can't even take a shower yet I am so unsteady and weak.  I can't sleep sit or do much of anything because my legs won't permit it.  I do my stationary bike two times a day that takes all I am to do.  And I do my hip exercises because I have a hip that pops out.  I am just miserable and don't see an end in sight.  

I know someday this will end but I don't see it coming any time soon.  I remember last time it went on over a month and it was a very slow progression back to normalcy.  It wasn't like pain pills where after two weeks I woke up and just felt normal again.  Only thing this nightmare of withdrawals relates to is Benzo withdrawals.  Now that took a year to finally end all the way.  It was horrific.  

So that is where I am and I am not happy at all.  Words for light at the end of the tunnel would be greatly appreciated.

Here I am a 41 year old mother of 3 trying to quit a bad habit once again. I can only conclude that living in reality without some substance to make me feel better, to deal with the challenges of life, to handle my sometimes crippling insecurities and social anxiety seems almost impossible. How can I avoid falling in the trap once again after dealing with aftermaths of quitting my kratom addiction (for the second time) Antidepressants make me feel flat and have some undesirable side effects, I already run 4 times a week which I absolutely love. I feel I'm constantly chasing that peace of mind, that feeling of serenity and I'm never there.",9

I am 100% back to normal (was back to normal honestly after about 2-3 weeks I think).  I stopped coming to this page because I realized, I don’t really need supported anymore, but will try to help others.

For anyone struggling, are worried about jumping off, we all went through it.  Best example is the “swimming pool that feels cold”, just jump in that bitch, swim around for a few minutes, the cold will pass.  You can dip your toes, and slowly get in, but once you hit your balls, your mind will fight you “oh shit, turn back turn back, it’s cold, I need to be warm”.  

I thought Kratom was helping me, but I realized it was masking, and I was slowly becoming a shell of a person, void of normal human emotion and physically becoming weaker.  Motivation = dead.

After about 2-3 weeks of being clean, ambition/motivation returned, saw what I was missing.  At almost 3 months, I have thought about Kratom a handful of times, and you know what? I thought about how it made me feel.  Sure I felt the “euphoria” and melt away pain, but I remember how shittttty I would feel every 2-4 hours, and how the shit taste, and being so god dam dependent on it, I would take it all the time or risk getting cranky/upset/blah. It ruled my day.  “Do I have enough?”, “what will my wife think of she knows how much I take?”, “why do I find myself short tempered with my child?”, list goes on.

Anyone who has been on it for over a year, jump in the dam pool, leave it behind.",55

On Aug 15th I took my last dose a single cap of extract that I took before a flight to the UK. Up to that point I had been doing an ok job of tapering down to about two doses of ~5 gpd. I moved here to attend university from the us knowing full wel k is illegal here. What I didn’t take into mind is that codiene is not (I’m a very seasoned opiate user) I’ve taken codiene about 4 times when the k withdraw symptoms were bad. Now I’m 3 days clean again from everything and I’m actually feeling ok mentally. The biggest thing is my fucking gut. I have an appetite and I can eat but I’m shitting 5 or 6 times a day and it’s all horrific fart propelled diarrhea (lol I know) any idea when this will stop? I know everyone is different but any tips? It’s not the diarrhea that bothers me(I’ve been through heroin withdrawal many times).

2021-08-25 09:06:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/pbatl4/most_remarkable_effects_of_quiting/,Most remarkable effects of quiting,"So 6 days ago I decided to quit kratom. For a year it went well and stayed on the same dosing. But for some reason yawning, muscle tightness and bad sleep increased dramatically. O, and there wasn't that much fun in dosing except for relief of the first 2 symptoms. I wanted to share my experience to help some of you who are struggling right now and for myself why I stopped. General things applied like 2-4 days of terrible sleep, yawning, blurred vision, runny nose, lack of energy and terrible restless legs.

But the good thing about quitting kratom is that good withdrawal symptoms also start early. I've listed them underneath to hopefully give some motivation to quit to others and remind myself why I quit. I found some of them quite remarkable. 

-music enhancement
Music seems way more enjoyable without kratom. I feel way more emotion with music than I did before, which also improves the mood which is very welcome.

-sinus inflammation relief
Maybe this isn't as general, but I think it is worthy to mention. I had chronic sinus inflammation, already had some medicines for this, but didn't really work. Day 2 already there was so much pressure gone from my head, didn't really expect this. (possibly a general effect of kratom withdrawal or maybe due to mold/heavy metal contamination.)

-joint pain relief
Wasn't to aware this was such a problem for me, but now I know it was one of the worst things probably caused by kratom. It really feels like that old bike you were driving without looking after it, then one day you decide to change the bearings, clean out the sand in the chain and give it some oil and you are amazed by how much easier life could have been.

-memories and emotions get more vibrant
This one can also be a bit difficult, because negative emotions will be stronger too. But in general I think it is important to feel, even when it is negative. I was really surprised by how engaged and enthusiastic I actually can be in a conversation.

-senses work better
Multiple times I was surprised by the intense smell of some foods. Also hearing seems improved. Eyes feel a bit tired still and are slow in adapting to bright light, but I expect that to get better also. 

-bladder function
No more getting up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet. Also in the morning not feeling like you're going to burst. 

-tight muscles 
My tight muscles weren't from my office job apparently. I think blood flow was also impaired due to tightness of these muscles. Especially tightness of muscles around the hips and the calves were really bad, I think due to restricted blood flow. 

-Attention span increased
So for the first time I could watch an hour long interview without getting distracted. I was also fully engaged and enjoying the moment. 

I'm curious if some of you recognize these things or are motivated by knowing this could be improved for you. By the way it is not a very good time the first week, but as you can see it is not all bad either.",18

When I'm without it, I simply can't even bring myself to call anyone. I've always been like this and it is not something that kratom has caused, but rather the reason why I even started taking it. I take around 5-15 grams a day and have been doing that for about 7 months. I have avoidant presonality disorder and literally any conversation leaves me feeling anxious, regardless of whether it was good or bad. I tried to stop taking it, but the wds and fatigue isn't something I wanna risk losing my job for. Another thing is that I've always kinda been okay with wasting my time doing nothing as long as I enjoy it, which is another reason why I find it hard to stop. I can try to really quit when I have some weed to deal with the stress at home, but it still doesn't solve how I could deal with it at work. I'll be glad for any advice.",6

I'm afraid that I will eventually take this too far. And I'm also afraid that if I quit, I will put back on insane amounts of weight. Every night when I go to bed, I tell myself that I wont take them the next day. I so desperately want that to be true.

I am a former H/pill/alcohol addict, and quit the needle almost 5 years ago. I picked up the kratom around 3 years ago when I was afraid I was going to relapse on the H. Kratom has been a blessing and a curse- I haven’t drank or used other drugs since starting it, but I have become a daily user and often consume over 100 gpd. Since entering recovery, I’ve really blossomed into the person I’ve always wanted to be. I got into yoga, made great friends, and found a fulfilling spiritual practice. I also started my own business, and almost opened a brick and mortar restaurant. My business partner ended up screwing me over, and the restaurant didn’t happen. I’ve used K to cope with the depression surrounding the situation. I am at my wits end with this shit. I’ve lost a lot of my vibrant personality. I was always social and funny, but this shit has turned me into a loner. My mind isn’t as sharp as it was. I feel like my mental process has slowed down. On top of that, I am losing clumps of hair. I will often cry after washing it, because I’ll literally find handfuls of it at the bottom of the tub. I am a fit and active person, and I recently had to start cholesterol meds. I assume the K has affected it. I am worried that the excessive consumption will have long term effects on me. I have a deep fear that I’ll have cancer or something because of it. I know this is a stretch, but fuck. I’m posting this today because I REALLY want to stop. I want to wake up tomorrow, and take 25 percent of what I was taking. I know this is a jump for a taper, but I need to get this shit out of my system. I would go CT, but I have obligations and I can barely move without my morning dose. I also get dizzy without it- almost a light headed feeling. Is this normal? Anyways, that you guys for listening. I plan to post regularly to hold myself accountable.",8

Today is the first day without any extracts (last one was about 2pm yesterday) so far I've had around 10g today in powder. I'm feeling wayyy better than I had anticipated considering how much extract i was taking. Would you guys recommend just going CT at this point?

During my first quit (about 3 years ago,) I also went CT. It was the worst place I’ve ever been mentally in my entire life. The PAWS were instant and unbearable. I had crippling anxiety and depression and the complete inability to even smile. I made it about a month before I relapsed. I was sick of feeling depressed and it didn’t seem to be going anywhere any time soon. In no time I was back and heavily addicted yet again.

I knew I didn’t want kratom in my life anymore but I felt stuck. So I continued the bullshit for the following 3 years, which brings us to now. 

I’m currently on day 5 CT and any symptoms I’m having are minimal. My appetite is fine. Aside from the first night, I’m sleeping fine. I feel slightly fatigued but nothing major. I’m in a decent mood and I’m getting enjoyment from things that I haven’t in years. I belly laughed at something my brother said and it made me realize that I haven’t even really found things humorous for a long time. 

What the hell is going on here? I’ve been terrified to stop because of my first attempt. I almost can’t accept this lol. Am I going to get blindsided with worse symptoms soon? Anyone else have a similar experience?

I know so many are against the suboxone…and I get it. But I say again, it is the best option for me. It is keeping me steady. I am not high. I am accustomed to it. I will have withdrawals but it will be a medically assisted taper and detox. For now, it is keeping me from running all over trying to find the kratom I like and spending a fortune and packing it with me…. It was too much of a priority in my life. With the subs, I don’t spend hours a week hunting for drugs(if or wasn’t kratom it was something else). Kratom was a substitute for all the other stuff I used to do. And using kratom was an improvement over the crap I was putting in my body, but it caused me more problems (besides the time I took too much heroine and passed out on the bathroom floor at work)….I, unlike most, gained a good 30 pounds on it and am losing my hair. I am sure the lack of nutrients over the last 3 years, a full year of other stuff before the 2 on kratom, didn’t lay a good foundation for beautiful hair growth but the kratom did something to my hair somehow. 
I am eating more now. I am eating steadily and losing weight. With kratom, I barely ate because I always wanted an empty stomach for my next dose. And I wasn’t hungry. Nothing ever sounded good. 
Drinking water and eating prunes daily is helping a lot too. I should have been taking a stool softener or eating prunes the 2 years I took kratom. 
The last two weeks have been so good. I get up in the morning and drink a cup of coffee, go to the bathroom, and plan my day. I did that for 13 years (back when I was sober and a good mom and a Sunday school teacher). That coffee was replaced with dope then with kratom. I am so grateful that I was able to get the help I need to get myself stable for my kids and myself. 
Best of luck to everyone quitting. Suboxone is not for everyone, some will say it’s not for anyone! I have a heavy drug use history and the stability is what I need to get back to a life of sobriety and productiveness. And until I fix my mind and my addiction, I need the stability of the suboxone.

So im on day a month and a bit and Im doing grand. Mornings are the hardest, thats when I dosed and got motivated. Ive had to find new habits to get going, shower, coffee, pint of water.

The motivation is better. I can work, I enjoy it and can power through, of course I miss the epic levels of motivation before but this is normal life. I can sleep, poo is solid(ish) I still have waves of empty now and then, a feeling of empty something, but they pass, keeping busy helps so much.

Keep going! I remember so well being day 1,2,3,4 thinking a month is so far away, but its not, you'll be here too. After the first week try not counting days and comparing to others. WD seems to be such a personal journey

The absolute key is getting back to life, whatever that was for you. For me its a glass of wine and cooking in the evening, im there most nights, not all, but I can see it coming back.

Everybody gets a rainbow award. Im sending them cosmically right now, yours should arrive within 16 hours....",22

Heavy user on and off four years here. Easily averaged >69 gpd. Or somewhere thereabouts :)

In all seriousness, that figure is accurate. I took a shit ton of kratom. 

NOTE: I abused klonopin and adderall for a few weeks in July as well. I stopped those on Aug 4. 

It is no surprise I guess that I’m feeling like shit. Three powerful drugs each with their own withdrawal recently quit. But I can tell my symptoms are related largely to kratom.

I have zero energy whatsoever. Severe depression and anxiety. No motivation generally except to post my experiences on Reddit.

Sweaty hands and feet all day. I have been sleeping but wake up in a panic every day. Sleep lasts no more than 5 hours. 

I’m only able to sleep with a small dose of edible cannabis.

My question is: when does this end? I feel like I’m withdrawing from heroin.",8

At the peak of my usage I was eating six grams four times a day. I tried to taper once and it didn't work out. I recently just did a rapid taper from five grams down to 2.5 grams and I had my last dose yesterday morning. It has been a little over 24 hours since my last dose and I feel okay so far. Feels like the calm before the storm. I told my neurologist that I want to quit and he gave me some helper meds. I have a small prescription for clonazepam that I will only take at night time in effort to fight the insomnia. I understand the risk that comes with benzodiazepines. I have twelve days off from work so I can push through this.

I woke up and did some yoga, smoked a little CBD, and then I got on my bike and took some laps around the neighborhood. Just ate some food now I'm listening to some music. Music is medicine, too. It helps me so much. I believe in the good things coming.

I will get by. I will survive. Much love to everyone on this subreddit. The support from everyone here really is a beautiful thing. Namaste.

The supplements really help. 
Liposomal vit c
Some kind of mushroom tincture that relaxes you (it’s great & I can find the name later when I have the energy)
Magnesium 
Gaba
Melatonin at night

Spent most of yesterday without supplements (too sick) and what a mistake that was. Take the supplements!! 
Praying tomorrow is even easier. My first taper/quit I got bad tremors & mental issues so I gave up. Couldn’t handle it. I was too scared to try again for two years.

For anyone who's been to AA, NA, etc. Twelve-Step meetings, many groups give out Anniversary chips or coins. AA usually starts at 90 days and then a coin for every yearly sobriety anniversary. I believe NA starts at 30 days, then 60, 90, then every year.

So here's what we're contemplating on this subreddit... with variations and suggestions welcomed: Possibly a daily post by the mods of this sub (or maybe Automod, if possible). 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, etc. We'll list your Reddit username in the post with the amount of time you've stayed quit from Kratom. Obviously support and congratulations, etc. is encouraged from other members of the sub in the comments. More details to follow. Your ""anniversary"" or milestone will have to be submitted to the mods so it can be listed in these posts. This will create more work for the mods here, but it'll be worth it. **Suggestions and alterations to this idea are welcomed.  Please list them in the comments of this post only.** A tentative date could be September 1st to get started with this. Obviously, no real chips or coins will be given. But it's more about the encouragement and support to keep on going with your quit. Stay tuned.",13

Ever since quitting oxy about a year ago, I’ve picked up these bad habits and have finally decided to close the door on this part of my life. Easier said than done though, right? 

About 7 months ago, I quit kratom shots, after 8 months on (3 extract shots a day), with the help of vitamin C… Although I stayed off of them… I unfortunately fell into the grasps of tianeptine capsules and have been doing them pretty heavily for the past 6 months. The withdraw from tianeptine is pure hell. Like I said I have experienced oxy and kratom withdraw and they do not compare to the acute WDs from Tia. I planned on getting off of Tia by using extract shots when things got rough… and boy did they. Now I know what you’re thinking, “you’re just trading addictions”… well maybe so, but I would have done anything to get through the first couple days without Tia.

And that’s where I am currently at. I have been taking 3-4 kratom shots everyday since I quit Tia 8 days ago. Before this I hadn’t taken any kratom in months. I am attempting to CT off of the kratom shots before any more time passes. I took one extract shot this morning and a half of one about 7 hours ago. Which in all is about half of what I have been taking daily for the past week. 

I guess my question is, what should my timeline look like… will it be shorter than the last time I withdrew from kratom due to only doing some over the past week rather than the 8 months I was on them in the past? Or am I in for a rough week? Because I’m only 7 hours CT from my last dose and already feel the heavy/shaky legs kicking in along with the goosebumps! Any advice is appreciated !",1

My digital scale is just a regular kitchen scale, so it only weighs to the nearest gram, not down to 0.1 g unfortunately.  So I'm wondering:  do these scales utilize rounding, so once you get to 0.6 g it registers 1 g?  Or, do they only register 1 g once the weight actually hits or surpasses the 1 g mark?  I'm not sure if this question will even make sense to anyone but I can't think of a better way to word it.  Basically, if I put 0.6 or 0.7 g on there, will it say 1 g on the display or does it not display 1 g until you actually put 1 g or more on there?  

If anyone knows the answer, I'd really appreciate it.  I don't want to buy a more precise scale just for this because money is tight and I anticipate being completely done with kratom in a few weeks and no longer having any need for the scale.  Also, I try not to accumulate too much stuff in my life, as I am trying to purge unnecessary material possessions as we are getting very cramped in our one bedroom apartment.",1

I'm sure its a bit of both, but im wondering how much of it is withdrawels, and how much of it is the kratom was just covering it up in the past.

The taper was soooo worth it. My landing was soft. The worst of the acutes were over just 24 hours after my last puny K dose.

And when I say ""worst"" of acutes, they were the worst, but even those were manageable. 

For reference, my last WD was way back in 2009, when I jumped from a two week 16mg - 2mg suboxone taper. That was hell. Burning hell. I was clean for a few years after that. Then in 2012 shit happened and I ended up taking Kratom after realizing that if I stopped taking Tramadol (legit rx at the time) was actually putting me into WDs. Since then I've never gone more than 3 hours without dosing. Never took a break, not one. I never got much higher than 40gpd because when I did I would get sick, thankfully. If not for that I'm sure I'd be in that 60-100 range. All that time I fantasized about being free of Kratom, but always having a reason to not quit. It didn't have any severe impact on my life. I was able to advance in my career. Buy a house. Stuff like that. But having to always have it on me, to sneak doses, SUCKS. Going into WD because you didn't bring enough green powder, or because you're not in a good spot for a discreet dose, or you're traveling, or just trying to sleep a full night. That sucks. I woke up one morning in early July and I was just done. I knew this sub existed, for years, but never came here because I knew what I'd see. That morning I dove into this sub, reading stories, preparing myself. And I've been here every day since.

I tapered from 30-40 gpd down to 2.5gpd. I started with 9 even doses a day and at the end I was at 6 doses per day. 

The first week was the hardest week (including the past 5 days). I jumped from 30-40 down to 18. Anxiety was through the roof, I was crying a lot, I was shitting my brains out, my stomach felt like it was a small hard rock, I was a mess. But I was never more than a couple hours from my next dose, which would give me just a bit of relief, so I got through it.

The last week of the actual taper was the second hardest week. That's when the RLS started up. Those weeks I was taking 0.5g doses in the middle of the night to get through it. So RLS was a drag, but my anxiety levels were manageable, I pooped almost normally still, I got through it.

Then on the morning of the 18th I woke up fully expecting to take my morning taper dose, dropping down to 2gpd, and I just decided not to. I wanted to see how long I could go, turns out I could go longer than I thought. So I decided to push it to 12hrs from last dose. Feeling very shitty, but now that I've got 12 hours I want to see if I can get 24. Felt shitty the rest of the day. Took 300mg of gabapentin that night and had a restless night, but did manage to get some sleep in there.

Woke up the next morning expecting to feel worse than the day before, but to my surprise I felt better. On day 2, acute WD was over. From there till now I've had waves of feeling actually good, then waves of feeling gross. Every day those waves are less intense and less frequent. 

I've waited a few days before posting, because I was expecting I'd finally get the big WD wave crashing down on me, but it never came.

8 years of building up this WD boogyman in my head, and it in the end it just whimpered away. 

I have had loose BMs, but no diarrhea, anxiety is higher than normal but far better than tapering week 1, I sleep crappy but \_do\_ get sleep.

I know everyone is different. I know not everyone can taper. But if you are terrified of the WDs, please try a taper. Buy a micro scale, make a plan, and taper down. I'm not a terribly disciplined or even organized person, but I did it. You can too.

Some tactical info:

Agmatine was critical to the taper. I took 2000mg a day most days, split in 4 through the day. It just makes you feel a bit better when you're feeling that dose drop.

BSO was okay during the taper, but very helpful after the jump. I've been taking a teaspoon four times through the day. It makes you feel a bit better when you're riding a bad wave.

Vit C was great, too! I've been taking 2000mg doses every few hours since I jumped. Again, just makes you feel a bit better.

Gabapentin was something new to me, I started taking 300mg the first night of no Kratom. Since then I've taken 600mg at night. Definitely helps, though it doesn't totally make the RLS go away. Maybe I'm taking too low a dose, but worried about taking too much / too long. What it's \_really\_ good for is the burning skin sensation. Not all of us get that, but it is hell for those that do. The Gabapentin calms that down. When my GP denied me WD meds, I used a teledoc and got the Gabapentin script without fuss.

Delta 8, ooh boy, maybe the MVP here. I hadn't had THC in a long time. It always made me way too anxious. But, was open to trying something people had success with. I used a vape pen, which let me very slowly ease into it. After the first two uses, I didn't get that anxious feeling I associate with weed. Just felt good. Still leaning on that for the time. It doesn't make the WD go away, but it somehow makes it way easier to deal with.

That's it. Thanks for reading my long post. I love you all. Would not be here with 5 days K free without this sub. This sub is such a tremendous gift to all us lost in the K abyss <3",9

There’s still work to do and I’m not fully cured, but holy hell I would go through that pain in a heart beat to feel the freedom I feel now. It’s worth it, keep doing what you know must be done. 

side note for the dudes. Another downside to kratom for men is the lowering of male hormones and increase in female hormones. I never realized how much of an effect having lower testosterone had on my confidence when addicted. But now that I’ve been working out and those hormones begin to level out I feel so much more confident. All my facial and body features were pudgy and soft when addicted and I just felt like a hermit without a shell. Now my features are sharpening up and my face doesn’t look a puffy blobfish. Hadn’t felt that dumb ogre man rage in a long time but I gotta say I missed it. Getting hyped up at the gym, pushing hard and feeling masculine again is a good feeling.

Recently I've had bad pains in my abdomen, and went to urgent care.  I also had dark brown pee with what appeared to be dried dark brown blood in it (and it did test positively as blood).

I'm thinking that maybe I've had a salt deficiency or something and it was causing sleep issues. I did come across an article that said that seniors who took little salt in their diet had poor sleep which is what prompted me to try taking a bit of salt before bed each day.

While sitting and sipping our kava drinks we came across Kratom in a book of herbal remedies. Curious about it, we ordered a small amount online. That was over 5 years ago. 

We kept our usage fairly reasonable at 16 to 20 gpd but it was every every every day.   
First meet up at the kitchen sink for the sludge, then the coffee and cartoons every every every day.   
We tried to quit in April but were thwarted by Covid lol   
The symptoms of the worst sickness Ive ever had in my life mirrored the withdrawal of the herbal remedy I read about one date night half a decade ago. 

10 pretty miserable days with time passing in slow motion. My brain feels like it's a glue ball and all I want to do is eat sugar - so I did. I ate a bunch of sugar and took liquid magnesium and vit C, D - drank loads of liquids. 

It's easy to get and easy to be hopelessly dependent upon every every every day and quitting it will make you wish there were no more days but I did it - we did it...me and my also kratom attled husband who accidentally fell into addiction up to his eyeballs. We quit together and it has now been 14 days  since  I used and I am feeling like myself again.

I have written out ""my story"" a few times, but it always ends up being walltext and I know nobody wants to read all that. So I'll try to condense this down and can elaborate on it later if anyone is interested. (Turns out it's still sort of walltext. Sorry).

I'm trying to quit kratom in all forms. Right now that entails dropping down off of tincture and onto plain leaf. This is something I've done before without much trouble, so it has kind of caught me off guard how much trouble I'm having now. I've tried this several times over the past year.

I'll quit using tincture and switch to plain leaf with the aim of then tapering off of that too. I have some mostly tolerable withdrawal symptoms for about three days, and then the achiness and ""burning"" sensation in the skin and muscles gets noticeably better. So far so good. But like clockwork every time I hit Day 4 I have sudden onset of pretty pronounced depression and anxiety, and this is happening even though I am still taking plain leaf.

I've even gone for about two months like this thinking ""surely it is going to let up"" and then get so frustrated I get tincture again. Rinse, repeat.

So I guess my question is, has anyone else run into something like this while attempting to taper? It has discouraged me regarding my ultimate goal (quitting this damn substance in all its forms) to think that I feel this bad, and for weeks at a time, even while still using the leaf. It's easy to fall into despondent thinking when you are at this point, easy to convince yourself things like ""I might as well just go back to using tincture"" or even worse ""I guess this will be my new reality for the rest of my life, I've done some sort of permanent damage to my brain chemistry""

Thanks for reading. This whole experience is so frustrating!",3

I remain on this sub to help myself, and attempt to help others... which in turn ultimately helps me. I read every post on this sub and have read most posts here for the last 14 months since I've quit. (Not saying you have to, but I have been.) This isn't meant to knock or shame anyone... I pray it's only helpful. But we all know how ""anonymous"" posts / comments and the like on the internet can be taken out of context. So I pray this post is taken in the spirit that it's intended: To be helpful.

I'm a former long-time member of a 12-step group that I left about 10 years ago for my own personal reasons and not because of relapse. I learned many life-long lessons there that still stick with me until this day. Said 12-step group has a quote / slogan that asks ""Are you willing to go to any lengths to get sober?"" And another one along the lines of ""Until I make sobriety the most important thing in my life, I will lose everything else, including my sobriety."" Something like that. 

Over the past year+, those are *some* of the ""tools"" I've used to quit kratom and stay quit. At the risk of sounding judgmental (which, as previously stated, is not my intention at all), I see a lot of posts, particularly as of late, where prospective kratom quitters will say things like ""I can't endure withdrawaling from kratom because of *x, y, and z*... i.e. ""I need to perform on my job..."", "" I'm starting classes..."", ""I have children and a family to care for..."", etc. etc. **These are all important things, obviously.** Earning an income... Getting an education... Taking care of and providing for our families. Vital parts of life. My point is, while I was addicted to kratom, all those things (and many more) took a back-seat to my addiction. (Maybe it's different for different people. And these mindsets don't apply to everyone. Maybe. But I became a useless couch potato during my kratom addiction.) ""So why can't I keep these ""life priorities"" on the back burner a little while longer while going through withdrawals (whether it being tapering, going turkey, going to a detox / rehab, etc... Whatever the chosen route of getting off of this stuff is for each individual.) What's more important at this particular time? Will I be of any use in those vital life-situations until I get free of kratom? For me, nope. Maybe with tapering I can be... so that's absolutely a viable option... but it isn't so for everyone. (I tapered for 7-weeks myself.) Some folks find they have to go CT. Some folks find that they have to seek medical attention to detox / withdrawal. Different things work for different individuals... Just like the time table for getting past acute withdrawals and / or PAWS is different for everyone, so can be methods of quitting and staying quit.

So my point is... and the question I had to (continue to have to) ask myself is ""Am I willing to go to any lengths to quit and stay quit?"" The bottom line for me is **I DON'T EVER WANT TO USE KRATOM AGAIN IN ANY FORM WHATSOEVER.** So yes, I was willing and I AM willing.

Maybe it's a generation gap. Maybe I'm just too old for half-measures in my life. I don't know. But that's what works for me. Maybe some folks haven't ""hit rock bottom"" yet. Maybe some aren't fully determined to quit and stay quit. I don't know. That's for each person to decide for themselves and not meant for debating. But as an individual quitting and wanting to stay quit forever, I believe it's important to know these things... believe these things... be committed to going to any lengths to be free of the hand-cuffs of kratom addiction so I CAN be a productive member of society in the various aspects and priorities of my life. Staying quit, for me, is priority #1. Because without it, I'll eventually have no job, no family, no life. At least that's how I see it. It's worked for this long. I pray it works for the rest of my life... one day at a time, obviously.

Best of luck, as always, to everyone quitting and staying quit. Keep on trying until it sticks. Remember, if you're new or haven't seen it yet, read our sub's [Beginners Guide](https://old.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/7p0qx2/read_this_first_if_youre_new/). Within it is a [Taper Guide](https://old.reddit.com/r/modquittingkratom/comments/63tjtd/tapering/) and a list of suggested supplements and helper meds, etc. if you decide to go those routes. **THERE IS HOPE! THERE IS LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL. YOU CAN QUIT AND STAY QUIT.** Peace and Love.

PS: One last thing, don't forget about our subreddit's Daily Check-In Thread. We're getting more check-ins and support there than I've ever seen since I've been here. Truly amazing and helpful, in my experience!

Exercise and proper diet have been of utmost importance to me staying quit. I've lost 60lbs (yes, on purpose and well needed) and am more active than I've been in 15 years (I used kratom for 3+ years, 20-30gpd.) Many years before kratom I used to run marathons. I'm not quite *there* yet, nor have any immediate plans to, but an hour or more of cardio per day and eating healthy while staying quit has done wonders for me. STAY BUSY!",19

Meth, heroin, methadone, Suboxone, alcohol, etc. I started using kratom two and half years ago and of course loved it at first. Natural, safe, effective, you know the deal. Once I realized how addictive and hard to get off of it it is, it was too late to easily quit. Despite that, I have successfully quit maybe ten times, temporarily of course. My last successful quit was at the end of March and it was a mother. I had gotten on Suboxone to try to quit extracts, 3-5 a day. What happened was: Suboxone didn't block the effects of kratom, because it is an atypical opioid and doesn't work in the same way as traditional opioids. So...I used both for about two months, took two weeks off work and just jumped from both. What followed was the most fucked up thing that I've ever gone through, and I have gone through some real fucked shit in my time on this planet. I stuck it out and was good for like two months. Then, as I'm sure you guys have experienced, my addict brain convinced me that I could use k responsibly. And I did for a couple weeks. Then I started the self abuse again. Through it all I have forced myself to take a day or two off once a week and that has ameliorated the physical withdrawals. However, I have started drinking. Like all day every day. Mostly as a way to kill the soul-crushing guilt, and also I think, because deep down I want kratom, and drinking lowers my inhibitions enough that I will pick up. In a way, kratom makes me a better person. Without it I am quiet and timid, with it I am outgoing and live life freely. I know this is an illusion, but it's so convincing. I know the real me is still in there, but I can't stop. I have even been feeling suicidal lately. I have a daughter and a fiancee that lost her dad to suicide when she was twelve, so I would never actually act on the impulse, never, but I feel that having these thoughts is detrimental none the less.

I used Kratom for about 2 years and, at the most extreme, was taking 8 to 12 g/day. Two months ago I started tapering, got down to about 1.5 to 2 g/day, and decided to stop completely there. That was 11 days ago.

For the most part, things haven't been terrible for me, but very inconsistent. Some days I can get through no problem, feel happy and more alive than I have in years, other days I'm completely sapped of energy, irritable, and can barely focus. I guess I was expecting that it would take some time to adjust, but that it would be a gradual transition from withdrawal to normal. Is that not the case? Should I expect to bounce back and forth like this?

I'm currently on a major down day, really struggling at work. My torso and arms feel like they're burning and I'm just generally aching and feeling anxious. RLS, obviously, but I don't mind that so much. 

Also, I've been craving kratom more today than I have so far since stopping. My mind keeps through these loops about how I've done so well so far and I deserve a break, and that just a short reprieve would probably help get me through the rest of withdrawal more easily. I think I just really want to be able to disengage again.

Thoughts, suggestions, and encouragement are all appreciated. Thanks.",4

Quit CT from three years of 20-50 gpd, used in periods of up to 10 months straight with some weeks or months off here and there. Today marks the first day where my brain fog seems a bit better. One thing that delayed my recovery was the fact that I used pregabalin at 150-300mg everyday for the first two weeks, a bit longer than recommended. Also used for one evening a week and a half ago which definitely set me back a bit. Although I'm glad I didn't cave to the green sludge instead. This isn't my first rodeo with either kratom or pregabalin withdrawal and even though I've never been addicted to pregabalin psychologically I have definitely experienced the physical withdrawal symptoms before. I still firmly believe being on pregabalin helped me avoid a relapse in the first two weeks - I could really feel the severity of my withdrawal underneath that artificial cloud of wellbeing this time. Kindling is a real issue when you've gone through a few quits.

Anhedonia, anxiety, insomnia and RLS has been... tough. Especially the anhedonia and anxiety part for the last two weeks. Seemed like I'd never see any progress there for a couple of days. Sometimes I even felt like I was going backwards. It's non-linear and strange, this thing.

Another complicating factor this (final) time is that I simultaneously quit Zoloft at 50mg/d after a rapid taper (25mg/d for 1 week, 25 mg/d every 2-3 days for 1 week). Been on them since March last year. The brain-zaps are for real, today might be the first day that I've only had one or two.

I'm not really depressed per se, never have been (other than periods of self-implicated depression from kratom and years of weed (ab)use). I've had catastrophic thought loops and a lot of self doubt though for as long as I can remember. I see now that this probably stems from weed. I smoked a lot in the same ever-relapsing patterns as kratom since the age of ≈15. A whole 6 months is the longest I've been totally sober from everything in the last 15 or so years... That's a realization I've been avoiding like the plague, even though I always really knew deep down.

Historically I've been able to manage those issues pretty well, but when the pandemic hit and I lost my job that part of my brain spiraled totally out of control. So I went to see a doctor, he gave me the first-line treatment for generalized anxiety and that was that. I usually research all the medicines, supplements and drugs I put into my body really thorough (this stems from a general interest in neurobiology, supplements and drugs since those early teenage days of too much internet and an itching curiosity towards all kinds of brain altering substances). This time not so much, I was just too... fucking... tired. Big mistake. Now I'm somewhat afraid I've wrecked my brain for good, reading all those stories of never ending brain fog from SSRI withdrawals.

But hey - Zoloft isn't the worst thing I've put into my body, over the years. If anything the slowly spiralling alcohol, weed, kratom, CNS (mainly coke and amph), empathogen and [insert random drug here] polysubstance (ab)use is the culprit here. Though I'm sure the Zoloft didn't help my case either.

I realize now, over the years I've kind of lured myself into this false sense that something is actually wrong with my psyche, that I'm depressed, abnormally anxious, nervous or whatever. When in reality it's probably just long periods of PAWS from all kinds of different shit combined. It's like I **wanted** to find something wrong with my brain in order to keep my everlasting quest of trying to fix myself rolling along. I think some slight overuse of weed in my early 20's was the thing that initially set me on a downwards spiral of self doubt, shame and constantly misdiagnosing myself. That was also a realization I had to pry from the deeps of my soul. Imagine, for years, you'd rather misdiagnose yourself with several severe mental illnesses over trying to sober up for a year. That shit is scary af. Denial at its finest!

This time I took a chance and leaped into a semi-high dose of LSD (done it a few times before, never without kratom though) on my second clean weekend off kratom and Zoloft, and I wept... for... hours... realizing all of the above. I asked the universe for forgiveness, as well as forgiveness from myself. I ultimately caved in and faced all of the shit I've put myself through. Such time wasted. At the same time, so much knowledge gained and fun had. Although there's been a lot of unnecessary suffering, I genuinely think the experience is something I wouldn't want to be without now. It's like; I've had a lot of fun, it's been wild at times, it came at a price and I'm stronger now. Time to pay my dues. After all these epiphanies, things seem... different. I have a whole new mindset this time around. I'm honest with myself for the first time in 15 years.

Something that definitely helps quitting this time is my new job which I absolutely love and my beautiful dog of 1 year. I also just bought my own house with a big yard right next to a beautiful lake on the countryside, and now live in a totally different part of the country where I know literally noone outside of work and extended family (very non-toxic and genuine people all around).

I'm sure I'll be fine - I have all the time in the world now.

Anyways thanks for reading, just wanted to vent some. I hope my timeline and thoughts can alleviate some anxiety out there.

To anyone struggling, it gets better, even though at times it doesn't seem like it. Then it gets temporary worse, then better again. And so it continues until the number of good days overtake the bad ones. Godspeed!",4

I feel a little better so I wanna explain my situation a little. I was taking this stuff since I was a high school sophomore. I just turned 20 and it’s been about 4 or 5 years since then. I’ve tried to quit I think 3 times, which went well at first, until I noticed my tolerance shoot down and I was getting strong effects that trapped me again. I can’t begin to explain what it has done to me. I have strong passions and want to work hard at my goals, they’re big. This shit has made me feel trapped, jealous of everyone else who wasn’t constantly chasing a 30 minute period where they feel normal, spending lots and wasting lots of time doing it. I couldn’t eat, because it would kill the effects and I’d be back in pain. I lost a lot of weight. I love science and math even though I wasn’t good at math, but I’d only study while under its influence, and even though I wanted to get really good at math I would have no motivation to study without kratom. I’ve done plenty of adderall and smoked a ton of weed, drank a good amount, but this mysterious powder had by far the heaviest negative impact on me. I’m currently WD from weed and kratom, but the kratom is much worse. The physical WD has been a nightmare and kept me from quitting before. My back hurts my temperature is off and my stomach is not right. But mentally it’s not very easy either. I’m an optimistic person, I like to choose to love life and see it’s beauty, and that keeps my head above water, and it’s easy to see the cravings and WD as something that isn’t me. But damn I need more motivation. I been drinking lots of water, exercising and sweating pounds a day. God, what is quitting heroin like. Anyway I hope the pain isn’t in vain. I’m done for good this time",8

Posting to relay the last few days of struggles and how I’m trying to move past them. Feelings of loneliness quickly led to dwelling on past transgressions while using (lying, stealing, etc.) and got me into a vicious downward spiral of self loathing - a very common and dangerous trigger to start using again. 

I went online to read more about these feelings and how detrimental they can be to recovery if you dwell on them. I then came across the most simple and basic advice which I know but tend to forget:  Do for others. Give back. It gets you out of your headspace and thinking you are the center of the universe and makes you feel good for a change. For me it was simply picking up on the fact my wife was out of ingredients needed to make some home made salsa and I offered to go to the store Sunday evening and get what she needs. A simple gesture but it was all it took to snap me out of the deep depressive spiral I could feel myself heading towards.

I’m still not 100% feeling right but nowhere near the cliff or relapse that I could sense looming this past weekend. Community service and service to others really can help give perspective. Make an effort to make this part of your sober life - you will be glad you did. 🤗",24

I've been on and trying to get off kratom for years now, each time hating myself more and my usage just keeps getting worse each time. 

I quit a nasty heroin and meth addiction about 5 years ago. It was hell on earth and my life was in shambles. I eventually found a recovery program and a wonderful support system. I still struggled with cravings, past trauma, and the shame about my time in active addiction. I thought I could drink normally and found out I couldn't. That's when I found kratom. It helped with cravings and most of the time I didn't look high. I went to school, finished my bachelor's degree, and stayed with my AA program of recovery. It was all a lie and every month I stayed on Kratom things just kept getting worse. Like really bad, sometimes I'd take so much I would shake and vomit. What a way to live.   


My sponsor knows about my usage as I've been trying to quit for two years now. The insanity of it all is that I logically knew that I would feel better if I stopped but felt like I couldn't. Every weekend I'd say, ""this is it, this is the weekend I quit."" I have never followed through.   


This time though, I'm going to do it. I'm starting my master's degree today and I want to do this sober. Honestly, I don't think I can do anything on Kratom anymore. I really don't know what to expect or what baseline is, I have not had more than 60 days of sobriety in over 18 years and I was a young teen then. I am now on day four of no kratom, I got a few hours of sleep last night and I'm eating Vitamin C like a crazy person. I'm not great, but I'm ok.",13

I just wanted to say that, knock on wood, I made it to the other side. I wanted to emphasize that, for me, I NEEDED to seek medical help with my kratom compulsion. So I saw a psych and got prescribed naltrexone. Knowing that you CANT GET HIGH from kratom made all the difference for me! I stopped thinking about it almost instantly.

A little back story, I progressed from half an oz of powder a day to an oz.. and from the oz of powder I switched to kratom shots.. usually one a day, at the worst of it id sometimes get 2 a day. It made me moody, crushed my ego, crushed my drive at work and in the gym, etc etc. I had about 3-4 years of daily use. It was a disaster. Spent so much money at the smoke shop, I hated even driving over there. 

Anyways, I just wanted to say that it’s totally doable to stop this madness. If you can’t do it with willpower alone, see a doctor! They may be able to help medically!!",14

So my other option is to taper. This isn't my first rodeo with kratom. I've quit before. But It wasn't until I checked myself into a detox that I did quit successfully. They gave me medications which tremendously helped my WD (Gabapentin, A small dose of subutext, some non addictive benzo, and trazadone for sleep). But now I'm back on the Kratom train. 30 GPD for about half a year now. Detox is still an option, although not the best option as I don't have the funds to go to detox, nor do I want to confess to my parents that I'm back on Kratom. I'm not sure how they will take it. I live with them and am on their insurance so if I do go, they'll know about it.

That leaves me with tapering. With tapering the physical WDs are no issue if you do it right. The hardest part though, at least for me, is the depression that comes with not having a crutch to lean on. Kratom doesn't do anything for me anymore, if anything it gives me a small buzz for a little bit. But as of now the cons outweigh the pros. Yet I still can't stop because in the back of my mind I know it has helped in the past, and sometimes I do get surprised with a nice little high, and the fact that I COULD take it always leads to contemplation which always leads to impulsively buying another bag, telling myself I'll start my taper tomorrow. Tomorrow never comes. Even though the Kratom doesn't help my depressed mood anymore persay, when I get in that depressed mood, I'm so averted to pain that my brain will automatically reach for the Kratom no matter what. 

I've always had trouble with motivation. I've done so much therapy. I have so much insight into how my mind works its exhausting. I know what triggers me. I know why I use. Yet I can't get myself to act on my personal insights and just do what I know is for the best. I want to quit so badly, yet I can't even taper for a day without impulsively upping to a full dose.

My question is, how do you guys take the plunge and do it? Especially people who are tapering, those who need to make that good decision everyday. Do you have any tips? Maybe this isn't something you fellow redditiors could help with. It's probably ultimately up to me to just suck it up and do it. Maybe there is no more advice to be given. But I figured it would be worth a shot.

My defeatist attitude tells me everyday I try to quit, that I can't. That I've always been a procrastinator and I as a person can't taper. Maybe it's merely my attitude holding me back. But how do I change this attitude? I'm interested to hear your guys' insights. Maybe detox will be the only option in the end, although I would hate for it to come to that

I had a really bad stomach virus, stopped being able to sleep, and started having anxiety and panic attacks. I went on an elimination diet to see if it was because of food, but then couldn't eat anything, because it all gave me panic attacks... including water.

Being slightly a nerd, I was able to trace my problems to Cortisol. Got it tested, and the max normal during the day is 18, and at 9am, mine was at 20 (blood test, not saliva). The panic attacks happen between 11 and 4pm.

I've started ashwaganda about a week ago, I've been able to sleep about 5-7 hours a night, and eat normally around when I take the ashwaganda, but while the panic went down initially, it came back after I ate something my gut didn't tolerate too well. 

I'm trying to see if there's anything safe yet effective in pushing things like cortisol lower more quickly than the standard dose of ashwaganda. I normally have low blood pressure, so I don't wanna try CBD or stuff like that. And I'm not sure I should increase my dose of ashwaganda.",1

Hopeless.","I’ve struggled with Kratom for around 9 years. I seriously have the worst addiction that I’ve heard of. It’s sent me spiraling mentally and deep in debt and in trouble, has absolutely ruined my life and hope for any future. I have zero hope and know if I ever want a chance to be normal again, I’m going to have to quit. As unbelievable as it may sound, at my height I would use an 8 oz bag of Green Vein Meng Da every 2-3 days. 3-4 times a day I would feel a medicine cup, like for kids, full of the green poison and swallow it with water. It usually takes at least 4 of these cups every time I take it. I know that’s a VERY high dose, sounds like it can’t be true to some I’m sure, but it is. I’ll take this dose and if I feel nothing, will panic and choke more down in an hour.

I have four kids and have been married throughout this battle and have somehow hid it perfectly. No one knows about my addiction. Crazy huh? I’ve asked for help in the past but never asked for the help I need. I’ve got to quit.

I’m completely broke at this point and have no way of getting more until pay day in eight days. Scares the hell out of me to be honest. I’ve already gone into withdrawals but have spread out what little I have to make it tolerable, but now have none and have no way of getting more. I’ve tried to quit before and know what’s coming, but with an addiction this large…I just don’t know how I’m going to make it. The last time I quit I literally didn’t sleep for 6 nights, at all. But then I had worked from home and could hide it. But with my current situation, that’s not going to be possible. And I’m taking more than I did then. I’m scared to death I am going to lose my job. I don’t know how I’m going to carry on semi normally, to function, through the the hell I know is coming. It’s going to be bad, I know with my high dosage it may be dangerous, that I should taper off, but not sure what choice I have. I am such an idiot. 

I’ve looked at sites but really not sure what I can do to help ease this and function enough to not lose what little I have. I’ve sold everything I’ve ever owned of value, ground zero, out of time, no choice but cold turkey. I’m scared out of my head and hate myself for what my family is about to see.

Just need help. At this point, I’m hoping for a miracle so I can get some more and taper off safely, think that’s my only hope. If anyone has any suggestions, love to hear it.

I don’t feel sorry for myself. I’ve done it. I do wish there was more information on when I started so that I’d know it was addictive. I was assured it was safe and took it to manage depression. Now I just take it to be able to make it through the day.",24

This has been like one giant fever dream.,"I’ve been struggling with brain fog over the past 45 days and it’s honestly been really scary. Over the past few days though, things have really improved. My word recall seems slightly better. Concentration is improved a bit. This is how it happens, I suppose. 1% improvement at a time. Agonizingly slow daily progress. Never going backward, but hardly moving forward.

I’ll still take This over being hooked on the sludge.

I had a conversation the other day with my sister. She claims that a few months ago (while high on kratom), I told her I hate taking baths. I said, “that’s not true… I love baths!” 

But she insisted that I had told her I hate them and was pretty emphatic about the whole thing. 

I know it seems stupid, but it scares me a little. The fact that I was doing and saying things that aren’t true, and am unable to remember doing or saying said things. People say kratom is a benign substance compared to the harder stuff, but I definitely see some parallels to some degree. I had Moments like this all the time when I was on Vicodin. Are they really all that different? You be the judge…

As for now I’m in a place of quiet observation, watching this subtle healing take place at a snail’s pace. Watching as the last of the symptoms bleed away into nothingness. When they’re gone, what reminder will I have that this ever happened? What happens when all the remnants of an experience die out, and all that’s left are the memories of the hell you suffered through? Will that be enough to compel me to stay away from kratom forever? I hope so.  

When it’s all said and done and nothing physical about my experience remains, all I’ll have left is this sub. And you know what… I think that’ll be enough. But I’ll let you know when it happens.",12

First of all I wanted to thank this sub for the support. Communities like this can make a lot of difference, and it's wonderful.   
By now, I feel like the physical symptoms are pretty much gone. I'm back to who I was before Kratom (a person who was not ideal) but even a little bit better. I have genuine moments of being actually comfortable in my body. I can safely say that for me, when the wd and PAWS are gone, the weird substance that is Kratom didn't make a whole lot of difference. It really didn't. Also, the feeling alone of it having control over you makes it so, so not worth it. Not that I'm completely out of the woods yet, but it scared the shit out of me when it had its hooks in me. I felt like a slave, and that feeling was with me pretty much 24/7. The way I have been dealing with cravings is simply not trusting myself anymore on the once-is-okay attitude. I simply kind of assume I'll be back in the deep of it if I cave. So far, that has been enough. I even feel like my life is less on autopilot already. I'm living life more on my own terms. These are all very good things. Sure I still deal with lethargy, lack of motivation and occasional depression (I've suffered from depression for 5 years, but it feels like the \*worst\* is over). But I also have hope for the future. In one of my previous posts I wrote that a pretty small moment of conviction can make a whole lot of difference. Keep that in mind. Sure, the addiction can feel like this monster. But a small moment of strength can mean a lot.

I had been sober for 2 weeks but today decided to take some kratom. Long story, but after a stressful and exhausting morning today, eventually the cravings got the best of me and I gave in.

Now, I know that if you are dependent on kratom (or opiates, etc.) you are supposed to wait 7-10 days of sobriety before starting naltrexone, otherwise you will go into extremely unpleasant precipitated withdrawals. But since I already went through all the physical withdrawals and was sober for 2 weeks, can I just start taking naltrexone tomorrow, even though I did take some kratom today? Will I still experience PWD? Or will it pretty much be fine because I am not physically dependent again after only using it one time (probably around 15 grams)?

Would love to start it tomorrow to help ensure I don't lose all of the progress I made so far, but I also don't want to put myself in a situation that is dangerous or extremely unpleasant if I should instead wait a few extra days. Thanks for any advice!!",2

I'm not even sure why I'm posting this, I guess I just don't want to feel so alone in this struggle, you guys are awesome and I've been lurking for the past few days. 

I'll start out with why I started taking kratom. I was misdiagnosed and got put onto Abilify, and it was making me lose my mind. Not everyone has the experience, but people with ADHD (which I have) tend to react terribly to the medication, and end up having their symptoms exacerbated. Frankly, I felt like shit. I couldn't focus, I wasn't myself, and I couldn't think well. Every waking moment of sobriety was spent in existential dread. So I said fuck it, I've heard good things about kratom, let's try it. Boy did it make me feel good. It made me feel stupid, turned my brain off, quieted the internal ramblings in my head. Essentially, it was a life saver. 

As many of you can guess, a once in awhile treat from my agony turned into an all day, never ending lust for more. It got to the point where if I didn't feel it's effects, I was miserable, anxious, and scared. For many months, admitting I was addicted was just.. it was impossible. I refused to admit that. How could I, I reasonable person ever let myself succumb to addiction to a drug? That's not me, that's not what I do. And so it continued until 2 days ago.

My anxiety was through the roof, and every hit of kratom made me feel worse. I was anhedonic, restless, and my stomach always hurt. Something snapped in me that made me realize ""holy shit. I feel worthless on this drug why can't I stop taking it? And why do I take another dose in hopes of THIS one making me feel okay?"" So I stopped. I just quit it and decided to never touch it again.

So I'm on day 2. Yesterday was horrible. I thought I was losing my mind. Nothing eased the anxiety, in fact trying to ease it made it worse. I just accepted that my life was going to be terrible forever. And surprisingly, today I feel.. more stable than I have in many months. I don't know what it is, maybe some sense of pride in myself for not succumbing to my addiction for a second day in a row or what, bit I feel okay today. I know it's just the second day, and the withdrawals are far from over, but a reprove if only for a short while is nice. 

Just wanted to rant as I have no one else to talk to about this so thanks for reading! I'm feeling good. Also fuck kratom lmao",18

Just wondering how long it generally takes to start feeling “normal” again? 

My brain just feels all dried up every day if that makes sense. Endorphins definitely not flowing correctly still. Happy to have made it this far though!

The suffering has ended the intense agony like suffering and the insane chemical feelings, stomach empty pain and brain zaps are gone.

What remains of symptoms are pretty intense at times and sometimes lead me down the wrong path. My impulse control is at a low. My emotional stability is better but far from healed and my inner fire is sometimes burning but sometimes barely making light. It’s waves of ups and downs but for the most part I move through my day as a normal human being without constantly thinking about Kratom.

The goods now.

Creativity, Manic Energy, I get high now when I work out, sex drive came back fierce, hair already looking fuller up top, connection with life love and joy is so beautiful that it makes me cry sometimes, music touches me, books touch me, I’m engaging with friends and strangers alike
And it’s fulfilling.

I lost all that stuff with the Kratom.

Last thing I’ll say real quick is I’m a 15 year opioid addict started with pain pills then heroin then Kratom for 4 years.

I was hopeless you guys but it’s all coming back. I was so fearful of detox but I’m no longer scared. My body is way stronger I can jump in an ice shower without issue. I could never do that on Kratom I hated the cold.

And yet, now I don't.

4 year habit. 12-20gpd. Been off over 9 months. Took kratom every day to get through work. I thought it was taking me to another level I didn't otherwise have. It's only taken me one week back to realise it was all withdrawal. I have way more energy when I'm finished work at the end of the day than I did before. Sure I still get tired and stressed, but nowhere near the level I was during withdrawal. And now I can get through the day all on my own. 

I've been taking escitalopram the last few months. That's helped tremendously with mood, but if anything it makes me more tired and lethargic. But I'm still more energetic than with my kratom habit. 

If this can be a lesson to anyone else, it's that the ""thing"" kratom is curing is mostly lack of kratom (for me anyway). I'm so much more functional now. I became so convinced I couldn't function at a normal level without kratom. I had convinced myself my baseline was the feeling of withdrawal I was experiencing. 

I can't believe how much more ok I felt getting through my week. There will be challenges ahead of course, but not once did I think of returning to kratom this week. 

To those of you that think kratom fixes what's broken, you may be surprised to realize that it is the kratom itself that is breaking you. I know I was.

Sorry for the essay. I've been taking Kratom for about 5 years. Most of which was heavy abuse, taking 50+ gpd. About two years ago, I quit cold turkey from that level and what followed was the worst month of my life before I eventually caved again. Even at the month mark, I was still having withdrawals. Fast forward to two weeks ago, got myself down to about 10 to 15gpd for an extended period then decided to jump with the help of some low dose subs. I know a lot of people say that is a terrible idea, but without them, I wouldn't be off kratom now. I tried tapering many times and could never get past that 10 g mark so I knew I had to just jump. Had some sub strips which I've never used before. Decided to use them with the help of an ex addict friend.

Started off with about 2mg of sub strips for the first 2 days, then cut to 1mg for one more, then .5, then down to about 0.25 for another day. Thought I was in the clear so took two days off from subs. Withdrawals came back after the half-life wore off, so I took .25 or less for two more days. Stopped subs 5 days ago and have had no withdrawals from them. And I'm on day 15 with no kratom. In total, I'd say I used about 6mg total for the entire process. Started with an 8mg strip and still have a good amount left of it. Keep in mind, I was not totally comfortable on such low doses. It was just enough to keep me able to function somewhat. Still overall felt like shit with moderate restless legs etc, but I was determined to keep the sub dose as low as possible cause I knew the risk. But it helped immensely. 

Mentally, it was still a huge challenge obviously. Kratom really wreaks havoc on your brain chemistry. I was unbelievably depressed and anxious during this. But about 4 days ago, that started getting better. Today has been my best day yet mentally. I'm really looking forward to more improvement. I feel like an infant learning how to live again though, which is kinda scary. I'm having to fully restructure my routines. But overall, it is a massive relief to not be a slave to that disgusting green sludge anymore. I feel free. Its amazing not having to worry about getting home at a certain time so I can dose etc. My whole day revolved around that and it kept me from doing so many things. I'm ready to start living again. Day 15.

I'm not telling anyone that subs are the way to go for this, but it was the only option for me. And I'm proof that if you take the absolute smallest amount possible, for the shortest time possible, you can get through the worst of withdrawal without getting hooked. Just gotta understand you're playing with fire.

Edit: Thank you all so much for the support and nice comments. It means a lot.",27

Sure, I can buy just one ounce, enjoy it until it's gone, and be all good! Does not work that way. The lack of emotion, the anhedonia, and no motivation to do anything isn't worth it. Honestly you guys, about half of my doses were for nothing. I'm sure a lot of you feel the same way. It didn't do anything but helped me avoid withdrawal symptoms.

I've been a 30gpd user. I've been a ""responsible"" only-dose-for-work kinda user, too. Well, I'm done ya'll! I dropped my doses way down over the last two weeks to less than 10GPD. Yesterday I took a final 2.5g Bali dose around noon. I had some withdrawal symptoms last night (cold-sweats, runny nose) but they were VERY manageable. Today I feel unmotivated and I'm so tired, but it's honestly not bad for being my first day without kratom.

I'm proud of myself for making the decision to stop using kratom. Recovery is a rocky road, I know that for a fact as a recovering alcoholic. It's not easy, but it's worth it! One day at a time.",10

&#x200B;

Just wanted to say thank you for this community and all the excellent advice I've found by lurking the past couple days.  I've been using kratom for about 4 years now and I want to stop so I can have a baby.  I'm currently using about 25-30 grams/day but have used up to 75 grams/day pretty recently when the dependence got really out of hand.  

&#x200B;

My fertility doctor just prescribed me low dose naltrexone and from what I've read, if you take it while still using kratom, it will throw you into intense withdrawals so I feel like now is the time to quit so I can start the naltrexone (she only prescribed 3.5 mg/day).  Does anyone have experience with low dose naltrexone and kratom?  Will this low of a dose still have the effect of bringing on intense withdrawals?

&#x200B;

I think I will do a taper because I simply cannot be out of commission for several days if I did CT, plus I'm scared as I've been using for so long, and I think the taper will be easier for me.  Initially, my plan was to take about 1 gram less each day and be off it completely within a month.  But from reading here, it looks like a stair step approach is recommended instead:  going down 20% every few days.  Why is that the recommended approach?  Will my idea to reduce by 1 gram/day be more difficult than reducing 20% every few days?  If so, I'll do it the way recommended here.

&#x200B;

I plan on stocking up on some of the recommended supplements, like L-theanine and SAM-e so if anyone would like to share their experiences and what supplements helped ease their withdrawal symptoms, I would love to hear.

&#x200B;

Thank you again and props to everyone who successfully quit!  It's a difficult dependency to get rid of.  I'm actually a recovering alcoholic and I feel like the booze was much easier to quit than this.  I feel like an idiot for letting it get to this point.  But I'm ready to experience some suffering in the short term in order to feel better in the future.",5

I am a better man today. I feel better than I have in years, despite some minor PAWS.


If you've made it this far into my dumb little post, just know that YOU can do it, too. The first 4-5 days SUCK. After that, it slowly gets better. The 'Pink Cloud' arrives, and it feels amazing.

I was just wondering is it normal to feel like shit this low down into it? In between doses at this low of a dose?

And relapsed. I had horrible anhedonia and depression, and it's not like I'm feeling any better. Probably added a healthy dose of anxiety, repeat WD, etc. I still remember how much I suffered during those days before and right after quit. I feel like I'm right back to where I was. I definitely have issues with depression or anhedonia. I was going to the gym, speaking with a psychologist and focusing on work. All good things.

But as it happened before, at some point my life starts to feelsl like it's on autopilot. I don't enjoy anything. I have no desire to do anything. Working out makes me feel better for a shot while and then again I'm faced with complete emptiness and darkness.

Kratom isn't helping and just making me feel dumb and incoherent. 

But the cravings or desire to ""escape"" becomes so strong. It's like I am different person. I was basically crying as I was getting ready to go buy another 20 grams, because I feel so helpless. Once I quit, I feel ""alive"" for a few weeks and then something clicks and I cannot focus on anything be it work, life, even making a phone call is somehow difficult.

I've tried medications in the past and eventually it ends up being the same as kratom. No benefits only nasty side effects. I just don't know what to do anymore. Short of doing some shamanic ritual, I can say that I've tried pretty much every other modality to get out of this crap.

It makes me want to buy some kratom(again) just to escape the painful but positive memories. It's like my brain knows exactly what will affect me the most and is doing that just to fuck with me. I know kratom is the only reason I'm feeling this way in the first place, and I do not want to go back. It just seems like the solution for right now. I guess that's the trick of this devil eh? Keep going everyone! Much love to the community.",6

Back in December I ended up catching covid and developing some very troubling symptoms after it passed. It seems the debilitating vertigo and fatigue has passed. I quit kratom to see if it would help my symptoms and thats when most of my vertigo disappeared but I'm still dealing with a ton of inflammation in my lymph nodes and glands around my throat. This never really seems to go away and if it fades at all its only for a little bit but never even a full day. The blood tests my doctor did didn't show anything other than positive ANA. Has anyone here ever become chronically ill after using kratom longterm or after catching a flu after using kratom for a long time? Any input would be appreciated, thanks!",5

I have only had 2 or 3 periods of that 5 years of being 100% kratom free. I’ve Been to rehab 3 times in my life. I started using drugs at a very young age, growing up my parents were medical marijuana growers (and still are to this day) from when it was illegal and of course continued to grow once in because legal. It was put into my head at a very young age that drugs are extremely bad, and they will do nothing except ruin your life in the long run, they were very strongly AGAINST the use of hard/street drugs, BUT in there eyes marijuana was not a drug, but a “plant” or natural medicine. Just trying to give a little back story here. So of course growing up I had access to just about as much weed as I wanted. (Yes, I was VERY popular with the other kids in high school 😅) so all was well for a long time, right up until I broke my forearm completely in half skateboarding. That was when my real addiction began, to this day that initial injection of dilidid I got at the hospital was with out a doubt the most euphoric feeling I’ve ever had to this day. After surgery and everything else ECT, I was prescribed Narcos. Once again, I absolutely feel in love. Fast forward to my arm being completely healed, 100% off of the Narcos ECT. Now I was still smoking and providing weed to all my buddys. Provide weed for a little cash very quickly turned into “Hey My dad is prescribed Vicodin and wanted to see if you’d trade for bud” and of course, I thought that was a awesome deal (I was probably 14,15, maybe 16 years old) & on top of that I was getting all this weed for free from my parents. What I would call the evolution of “A kid having fun” to “A kid turning into a full time addict” was when one of my buddys had hit me up for some bud and when I got over there (his aunt had full blown cancer) he had began to tell me how he was able to get so MS Cottons (Morphine Sulphate ER Tablets) from his aunt that she left out, I figured okay well Vicodin feels really great, and the (1 time) I got dilidid at the hospital was very satisfying so what could it hurt, he proceeded to pull out a baggie with around 30-40 30mg tables, and about 50-60 60mg tables. This went on for a very long time, long story short eventually my parents found my stash in my room, like I said I was probably 15-16 years old, and it wasn’t just a few tables… nor was it a one time thing. I’m VERY greatful of this to this day, but my parents had forced me to go to a rehab facility. It shook me up pretty good, honestly I was just a kid trying to have a good time 🤷‍♂️ so after getting out I wanted nothing to do with the morphine’s. My bright idea was to just use other drugs instead 🤦‍♂️ (I now see how very foolish I was as a kid that thought he was in control of his addiction) so I bounced around between Xanax, weed, Vicodin, adderall, Valium, you name it (keep in mind I had access to just about anything I wanted because I was the kid that always somehow had obserd amounts of medicine marijuana) let’s just say EVERYONE wanted to be my friend.  Okay so that went on for a while until BOOM my parents find this insane amount of drugs from A-Z stashed in my Room. That Started Rehab #2…. Okay so I got out and was actually doing really good staying clean, then before I knew it was smoking weed again, I would use pills and stuff once in a while but just felt SO guilty. Then I found it…. the “miracle drug” or so if was marked as, and yes of courses talking about kratom. I didn’t need anything else, didn’t want pills, didn’t want weed, didn’t want to drink NOTHING! Kratom was all I wanted. It continued like this for some time. All it took was one slip up….. & unfortunately this was the worse slip up/decision of my life…. I got talked into trying coke, a few months of that turned into me trying crystal meth for the first time. Let’s just it got extremely bad extremely quick. It was probable only 3weeks to a month after the first time I ice that I was in Rehab #3 (mind you I’ve was also using kratom every single day up until rehab #3 (I honestly thought it was harmless, just like weed I thought) the withdrawals off the kratom in Rehab #3 were SOO bad they had to whine me off with suboxin for sometime. I Got out and made a promise to my self I would never use hard drugs under the condition that I can still use kratom (MISTAKE) my parents were pushing for me to go to a half way house pretty hard. Don’t ask me why… because I have no idea what I was thinking 😅 but I came up with the idea that joining the US ARMY would somehow “fix me” I’ve since been in the US ARMY for 4 years, Active Duty Infantry. I have stayed clean from everything the whole time but have been taking kratom the whole 4 years excluding basic training….. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ I can’t count how many times I’ve tried to stop, but I NEVER get farther the 1-2 weeks. I’m extremely sick of being a slave to this substance and am planning a extreme COLD TURKEY in the next few weeks",30

I have quit 5-6 times prior for varying lengths of time, but inevitably I relapse because of the cravings. I have read that naltrexone can really help with these, specifically the Vivitrol injection. I am thinking that having something that completely takes away the pleasure of kratom would be extremely beneficial to me. The injection is ideal because it would essentially lock me into abstinence until I could re-wire my brain and its’ associations with kratom. I’m really ready to be done with it for good.

Has anyone else on this sub tried this method? I am meeting with a doctor tomorrow, but she mentioned over the phone that she may not be able to prescribe that to me, since it isn’t FDA approved for kratom dependence.",3

Day 3 is pretty miserable. But I’ll live nonetheless. Work is almost impossible. Been doing very light exercise. It almost seemed to make the RLS worse last night. I’m talking a lot of recommended supplements that great people on this subreddit have recommended. Not sure if they’re working.

I just hope I’ve done nothing wrong to my blood pressure (systolic) it’s slowly been dripping from 180/100 to 130-140 over 85.  But I worry as my dad had early coronary disease when they did the autopsy after his suicide.  I just wanna be healthy so if anyone can recommend teas and foods to help lower blood pressure naturally, I don’t wanna keep taking propanol for my whole life or benzos. And I was sleeping fine up until I started increasing my dosage past 5 grams, but I’ve quit delta 8, caffeine (day 5) nicotine (day 5) and working to get out with my girlfriend and do more exercise like walking.  But it’s hard to walk 3 miles taking propanol.  I know things will work out.  I just thought by a week, it would normalize but I could be totally depleted of vital nutrients due to my usage.  Cause I’ve been here before.  It seems stress and blood pressure go hand and hand for me.  So my blood pressure rises and I get more nervous. I’ve also got gabapentin to help.   Mainly needing a word of encouragement, I feel I’ve fucked my body up permanently, that scares me… hence persistent anxiety hence fear of going to sleep, even though I’ve slept every night but I haven’t slept a full nights sleep without klonopin and hydroxizine, I am feeling like my usage lasted a while.

Running in place (would have been better to not run in place though) helped the most.  Being in the warm sun really helped.  Watching horror movies helped (kept my mind off what I was feeling physically). Eating large meals helped.

In the end I failed, but those things did seem to help, and I'll definitely be doing them again when I quit for good in a couple of weeks after a rapid taper.",6

I cut down to that about two months ago. Before that, I was more flux with it, more like 10-15 gpd over the past 2.5 years every day. But since early June, I have been sticking with 6 caps three times a day with two extra caps when I am feeling particularly bad. This isn't enough to make me feel good, but good enough to function.

I work a desk job but can do it from home. My biggest concern is the brain fog. The only real side effects I feel when I don't take kratom are: brain fog, fatigue and body aches. My eyes get a little watery but that's it. As for depression, eh, not really. I have always suffered from depression. In the beginning Kratom gave me a little Euphoria but that wore off over a year ago. 

Well, I am thinking of taking my last dose tomorrow around noon and just trying to not take anymore after that. 

Comfort med wise I have vitamin C, epson salt, ibeprofin, and prescribed Xanax. I know I will feel like crap for a few days but in you all's opinion by Monday morning do you think I'd be able to function enough to work from home? Or should I just prolong the process and wait until I can have a few more days off 4-5 days in a row around Thanksgiving maybe? Tappering just seems pointless because 9 grams is barely tolerable, I imagine it would just draw it out longer if I tried to taper. 

Oh and I have been taking Wellbutrin since April. Oh and I am 31-year-old, 5'2 female that weighs about 135 lbs.",2
2021-08-19 17:51:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/p7ojd5/struggling_but_i_think_im_finally_ready/,"Struggling, but I think I'm finally ready","Has anyone else ever tried to get clean cut then feel like you need one last dance with kratom for a sense of closure?

Here's where I'm at. Sorry for the length. I've been using for a little over 5 years. I gave been going through about 2 to 3 ounces per day. A few months after I first started using, I ran into an issue at work. I had a new job and had been there for less than a week. On the day of my first sales meeting with everyone in the company, I guess I took too much kratom. I felt fine for the first hour or two of the day, but at the meeting I totally checked out. When my boss introduced me to everyone, I started speaking complete nonsense. My friend said it seemed like I was trying to make a joke or maybe try to give the boss some hell, but nothing I said made any sense. Then I passed out or fainted or something and spilled my coffee all over myself. It was bad. They sent me away from work and had me take several drug tests for weeks. They don't test for kratom, so nothing came of it. I've never had anything like that happen again, and that's been 4 or 5 years ago. When this happened, my wife asked me to quit taking kratom. She even offered to help me taper off. I had trouble with that and didn't quit.

From that point on, I just got more and more addicted and tried to hide it from everyone. My wife busted be here and there, but I was always able to make it seem like a one time slip up and pretend to get sober again.

Over the years it got more serious, and I became a better liar and found all the little ways to hide my addiction and sneak around. A couple years ago, she found out I had been using for a while. She didn't know it was years though. She talked to me and I really thought I wanted to quit, but I didn't. I kept using and lying. I even spent almost a year going to intensive outpatient treatment which was a class/meeting almost every evening of the week. I learned everything there is to know about getting sober and staying clean, but I didn't. I was high during every single one of those classes. It was just a way of putting on a show of appearing to be clean. That worked for a long time.

Last year, I got a DUI and lost my job over it. My wife found out I was also doing kratom, but she thought it had only been weeks again. I took the DUI class, got my driver's license back, got a new job, and pretended to be sober. My DUI was in January of 2020. I was able to fool my poor wife into believing I was clean from then until 2 weeks ago. That was my longest stretch.

Over the past 5 weeks, my family has been through complete hell. Our kids got pin worms, the hoarder neighbor lady had 20 mice living in her unit and we had to fight hard to keep them from coming into our house, my wife's grandfather died, her uncle found out he had stage 4 cancer and had to get his liver and colon removed, and things at work went to hell for me. My mother in law had her third or fourth stroke, went to the hospital, and stayed there for a few days. She never wanted to be put in a nursing home, but we had to start looking into that, because we couldn't keep her safe at home any longer. This caused a lot of stress, because nursing homes are very expensive and there isn't a good one in the area that will take people with dementia. We were trying to get her on Medicaid which was difficult. While we were looking into that, she was transferred to a care facility that she could stay in untill we found her a permanent home. A few days after she got transferred, a nurse found her unresponsive and she was sent back to the hospital. She died that night.

Meanwhile, all of this stress is killing us, and I don't have any coping skills, so I'm getting extremely high. I went to see a doctor and I told her I was dealing with a lot. She gave me 2 Xanax. I hadn't had them in years. I picked them up, snorted both at once, finished my shift, and came home still very high. My wife was looking at our medical app and saw the Xanax under my name. The thing about Xanax is that it affects your judgement, so n instead of playing it off as a one time mistake, I spilled my guts to her. I just suddenly said ""I haven't been sober for one single day in the last 5 years. 

We talked a lot, I wasn't kind to her and I blamed her for a lot of things and initially refused to get clean. I stayed the next night at a friend's house, because my wife doesn't want me home when I'm high. We talked more and I agreed to get sober. I thought I meant it in that moment, but I didn't. I still used and lied after I came home. 

The day after the Xanax night where I told her about my addiction, she tested positive for covid. She probably picked it up from the hospital when she visited her mom. I figured I probably had it too, so I left work. Two days later, I tested positive as well. So at this point, we have covid on top of everything else going on. We had more conversations about my addiction, and I agreed to get clean. Work gave me 2 weeks of pay while I quarantined. We figured this was a blessing, because I could use that time to get through the first rough part of the withdrawals.

I made it about 2 days. The withdrawals were terrible, so I started using again. I didn't tell her. The plan was for me to get a few days clean then start taking naltrexone to prevent me from relapsing. She thought I was clean for those days and started giving me the Naltrexone. L Taking this stuff when you have recently used will put you into preciptory withdrawals, so I told her I had been using in hopes that she would give me time before I had to take it. I know how it feels when you take Naltrexone with kratom in your system because I had experienced it before, so I cheeked the pills for a few days.

She eventually found out I had been using and not taking the pills still. We fought and I once again blamed her and said all those terrible things you can't take back. After I got that out of my system, she calmed me down and started helping me figure out what exactly I'm struggling with. I have always had issues with depression and anxiety, but when I started kratom, I quit taking my meds, and everything was masked and suppressed under the high for 5 years, so I'm facing terrible mental health issues when I quit taking kratom for more than a few hours. 

At this point, half of my time off has already passed, and I only had about 6 days before I needed to get back to work. My wife suggested that I try a Naltrexone challenge where I start taking an 8th of a pill or less to see how much I might be able to handle Ave start increasing as we go. Theoretically, this should send me into preciptory withdrawals which will be terrible but last a shorter period of time. Like ripping a bandaid off. 

I agreed to this, but had a change of heart when it was time to take the naltrexone. I didn't take it that night or the next morning, but my wife watched me very closely that night and I didn't feel like I could get away with not taking it, so I did. Within 20 minutes, I felt like I was dying. Everything hurt on my body, I was nauseous, had diarrhea, felt like my guts were getting squeezed or crushed, couldn't see much of anything, couldn't stand up for more than 30 seconds without feeling like I had run a marathon, my skin burned, couldn't think, had trouble speaking, and every muscle in my body was tense and sore. I also had the hot flashes and cold sweats. It was the worst I have ever felt. 

Each time I try to stop taking kratom, I can't get more than about 1 or 2 hours of sleep at most. I can't get comfortable or stop worrying, stressing, panicking, having racing thoughts, and having awful anxiety. Sleep has always been very important to me, so losing sleep is one of my primary complaints with the withdrawals. 

The next morning after my first naltrexone dose, I tried it again but with the tiniest bit I could shave off the pill. It still made me feel terrible. Not as bad as the night before, but still awful. I talked to my wife about it, but a couple hours later, she asked me to take twice as much. I told her I had a doctor's appointment that afternoon and would not be able to drive to it if I took it. She was upset but she agreed.

When I first started trying to get sober, I tried contacting Recovery Delivered. They can send an at home detox kit. It has ibuprofen, clonodine, gabapentin, and Suboxone. I also asked for promethazine, and they sent it to the pharmacy. My wife said the Suboxone was a bad idea, so I told the doctor I didn't want that and that I was going to be staying naltrexone. She pushed and pushed the subs. She finally agreed to not give me the Suboxone, but when I went to the pharmacy, she had sent it anyways. I declined it and still haven't picked it up.

As I have continued trying and failing to get clean, I keep trying to get as many supports in place as possible. I have gone to a couple doctors to see if they can do anything for anxiety and sleep. They haven't been helpful, and a couple of them have tried to get me to take Suboxone. A couple of them have also told me that with how bad these withdrawals have been for me and how badly they are affecting my mental health, I should go to inpatient. At the beginning of my time off work, I didn't think I wanted it needed inpatient, but as I go along, I really feel that I probably should have. I wish I had gone to the nut hut to get clean and keep me safe through this, but now there isn't time for that. I have to return to work on Monday. 

The day my wife asked me to double the naltrexone and I said no, I went to see my primary care physician to see if she could help. I hadn't seen her in over a year. She talked to me and had me fill out one of those mental health eval sheets. It wasn't good. My result was very concerning. She told me I should go on Buprenorphine, which is Suboxone without naloxone. I explained to her that this isn't an option because my wife isn't going to tolerate me switching one addiction for another and being high on Suboxone at home. If I did that, I would have to live somewhere else while I took the Suboxone. She said the other option was to switch my anti depressants and give me a foundational medication for anxiety, but it would take 2 weeks to start working. She then pointed to my mental health eval and asked me if I would rather move out for a couple months and get better with the Suboxone or if I would rather keep taking the naltrexone and potentially end up killing myself. She asked me how my wife would feel if I killed myself over something she pressured me into doing. So I agreed to the Suboxone.

Later I went to pick it up, and the pharmacy didn't have it, so I went home and talked to my wife about it. She was adamant that I shouldn't take that, and she showed me hundreds of posts in this subreddit where people are saying the Suboxone withdrawals are 10 times worse than kratom and they wish they had never done it. I told her that I understand and won't take it, but I also told her I won't take the naltrexone. At least right now. We had a heated argument again, but she agreed to not pressure me into taking the naltrexone, and I agreed not to get hooked on Suboxone.

In the meantime, I've still been using. Much lighter doses than normal, but I haven't been honest with my wife. She thinks I'm about 3 days sober. I feel terrible about it. We haven't seen eye to eye on a few things through this, but she has been amazing and incredibly supportive. She has researched everything for me, given me tons of time to rest, taken care of the house and kids while I'm not feeling well even though she's sick with covid, bought me new comfy clothes, bought bath salts, bought all the different supplements that are supposed to help, ordered me a sobriety journal, and done her absolute best to take care of me. I'm so used to lying to her though, that I just do it by default. I'm a garbage human. 

Through a lot of this, I have felt like this is her choice she made for me and that I'm not doing it for myself. I have days or moments where I truly want to get clean, but then I change my mind and get angry with my wife. I have had a few good things happen over the last couple days though, and I'm feeling more ready to do this. I saw a doctor that that was recommended to me specifically for addiction and mental health. I saw him this morning and he was great. He gave me many options, listened to me, and actually worked with me to find something that will actually work for me and my situation. He gave me 2 weeks worth of Clonazepam to take for the anxiety at night. I go back in a week to check in and go from there.

I have also talked to a good friend of mine who has experience with addiction. I came clean to him about my addiction and the things I had done to manipulate him for my addiction. I'm starting to make amends with him, and it's going well. I was very afraid of doing this, but it's not so bad. 

I have appointments with therapists, I have a loving supportive wife, all of the things we can think of to help me through PAWS, medication, and a long term plan.

Throughout these last few days where my wife thinks I'm clean, I have just been finding my tiny little stashes and old bags that I've had hidden for a year or more. I haven't been taking much, just the last tiny bit or rinsing our empty bags and drinking the dregs. I haven't been very high. It's only been just enough to avoid withdrawals.

Today I feel like I'm making this choice for myself. Finally. It's better this way. When I feel like I'm being forced to quit, it creates toxicity in my marriage. The WTO is also working to ban kratom. If that happens, it could be 10 days or 10 years from now, but we're all going to be forced to quit at that point. I'd rather do that now on my terms.

I felt this morning like I needed to get some closure with kratom. I picked up a small bag that is enough to have one last good day with it. It's kinda like having that last lunch with your girlfriend before you part ways with her I guess. I'm now done. I completely flipped my house and got rid of every last molecule of kratom and tossed all of my hiding spots. It was very ritualistic and cathartic. I feel very ready and motivated.

I am cranky, with a headache, sinus issues, sneezing yawning and lots of aches and pains.  Which I expect as one who lives in chronic pain. After I stop anything that quills the pain even some it comes rushing back in worse than ever.  So I am pretty crippled over right now.  I am making myself get on my stationary bike at least twice a day and doing enough to get my heart rate up and keeping me moving around too.  I am having some abdominal cramps today.  So going to eat light just a salad.  I just wanna go to bed but I have a kittum so she needs attention and cleaned up after.

I wish I could describe how uncomfortable it is, because I don't want anyone to think this is anywhere near a normal sugar crash.

Luckily though It's gotten better as the months go by, as I'm able to eat more sugar, and get less of a reaction. But I still have know idea how sugar could cause all these symptoms. It doesn't seem symptoms of a normal insulin spike. The akathisia feeling and RLS is very real, and very uncomfortable.

Was recently extremely heavy user.,"Was ~100gpd user, in the last week rapidly tapered to 20gpd.  I got time off approved around Labor day (5 days off total), in about 12 days.  I'll be going CT the night before my last day of work so that it will be day 7 when I have to go back to work.  My question is, how should I taper in the next 12 days?  Should I go down by a bit every day?  Do more gradual jumps, e.g. remove 1g (per dose, so 4g total) every 3 days so that when I jump I'm much closer to success?  I could also always reschedule my days off, but 5 days should be OK right?  It wasn't too bad going from 100gpd to 20gpd surprisingly -- I'm not losing sleep.  I have a shitton of supplements I'm taking though (see my previous post history).

These are some scenarios:

- 8/17 - 4 doses x 5g = 20g/day
- 8/18 - 4 doses x 5g = 20g/day
- 8/19 (today) - 4 doses x 5g = 20g/day

- 8/23 - 4 doses x 3g = 12g/day
- 8/24 - 4 doses x 3g = 12g/day

- 8/26 - 4 doses x 2g = 8g/day
- 8/27 - 4 doses x 2g = 8g/day
- 8/28 - 4 doses x 2g = 8g/day
- 8/29 - 4 doses x 1g = 4g/day
- 8/30 - 4 doses x 1g = 4g/day
- 8/31 - 4 doses x 1g = 4g/day
- 9/1 - Jump and go to work one last day (I think I can make it one day, I did CT from 100gpd and made it 1 day at work OK)

Or, would it be better to do this:

- 8/17 - 4 doses x 5g = 20g/day
- 8/18 - 4 doses x 5g = 20g/day
- 8/19 (today) - 4 doses x 5g = 20g/day
- 8/20 - 3 doses x 5g = 15g/day
- 8/21 - 3 doses x 5g = 15g/day
- 8/22 - 3 doses x 5g = 15g/day

My paws haven't been to bad just on and off adehonia I suppose haven't really had to much in the way of anxiety. Kratom has made me worst off life wise of any other drug I've been addicted to. Ended up living in a cockroach infested apartment with 1500 dollars left in my bank account and getting fired from two jobs. Still can't believe that shit stuff fucked me up so bad.

I'm still pissed at the all the time I've wasted being high on this stuff. I've literally done nothing this past year except laid in bed and mindlessly  browsed reddit.

Do you guys think my withdrawals will come back to bad after relapsing this one time ?

Also have any of you gotten gyno or puffy nipples from kratom ? Ive done a couple steroid cycles and got a little bit of gyno from that and kratom made it wayyy worse. Luckily I bought some medication from china and reduced it a lot. I know kratom elevates prolactin levels I think high prolactin has a lot to do with how lazy this stuff makes you. When I quit for a couple of weeks and started taking it again I had decent energy for a month and then I got lazy again. Not for sure if that's due to elevated prolactin.",7

STAY BUSY! 

For me this is genuinely always staying busy. When I’m off work I make a plan. Pick up some more hours, get another job, Read a book, go to the gym, clean my car, go to a meditation group, go to my families and take my siblings out, learn new stuff, write a post on Reddit etc.. something I’ve done a lot of I’ve found was actually bad for me was LONG DRIVES. I know it sounds, dumb but when I do that, I’m just driving listening to the same music, that makes me feel the same way, and I’m just in my thoughts. Not much different than sitting on your bed having a million thoughts per minute. Keep your body moving guys!

Really stay busy. If you let yourself just sit there on your bed.

Something else to do is THIS: when I wake up I do a little 5 minute meditation (or more) where I just make myself aware of who I wanna be that day. It’s a Joe Dispenza meditation. If you don’t wanna do that do this: I go to the mirror and I talk to myself, yes I do! I make myself aware of not living today in auto pilot and to stay aware of my thoughts. I tell myself I’m amazing and after everything I’ve experienced in my life, I can go another day of being strong and grateful. The key is to stay aware of your thoughts and body throughout the day! That’s all. Do it and don’t allow yourself to drag onto a negative thought! Try it for a few days of hardcore willpower and you’ll start seeing yourself becoming happier.

This is how I have felt and this is only my perception. Yours may be different. 

At three months clean, it is hard to remember the intense cravings I felt when using. It’s hard to remember the anxiety I would feel when I even entertained the idea of not using kratom anymore. Life feels very normal at 3ish months clean. I’m just going through my routine. My routine does include healthy habits like eating well and working out, but these habits are just part of the routine. They don’t feel like special activities I’m doing as part of recovery anymore. I’m sure my brain is still healing at this point. I have trouble being idle which was never a problem before or during kratom use. If I’m not doing something “busy” I feel anxiety. It’s nothing unbearable, but it would be nice to be comfortable doing nothing sometimes. I sleep well, I’m more social and talkative, and my mood is more stable. 

At three weeks clean, all my acutes were definitely gone. Sleep was normal and my bowels were fine. At three weeks though, emotions were still intense. I mostly remember how good normal felt. Music rocked me to my soul, not so much at 3 months. I was extremely proud of myself and my new healthy habits. I was on that pink cloud about my recovery. All those feelings have calmed now. There was a lot of excitement about being clean after three weeks, I’m still proud, but clean just feels normal now. 

I think this is a dangerous time for my recovery. Complacency about my need to stay clean could easily slip in unnoticed. My brain could start rationalizing use easily. My commitment today is to not entertain any thoughts of using. Such thoughts will be regarded as intrusive and immediately dismissed. Entertaining a using though for even 5 seconds will lead to dark places. My feelings are different at 3 months vs three weeks but my resolve to stay clean is strong. 

Good luck to you all!",33

And you know what’s it like once you get past the worst part. It’s not always fun. Time gets slower. You’re bored. You think about it from time to time, sometimes you don’t. Motivation is hard to come by. Some of us go back to it, some of us stay the course. Sometimes it takes a few times to get it down to stay off of it. 

I see many posts talking about how they just don’t get to feeling better after. Well, I don’t always think that’s because of withdrawals....

In my situation, the withdrawals are over. The only really things I experience is slowed time, boredom, desire for stimulation because it’s what I’m used to. But maybe, the reason you still feel like crap isn’t because of the lack of kratom in your system, but because of the way you naturally are! Yes! What I mean is there is a reason you started kratom. For some, it’s nothing but a physical reason. But for many more, it’s emotional.

I think we confuse withdrawal sometimes with just how we naturally are depressed or anxious. And now that we’re sober, we need to figure out how to rewire our brains and bodies to be happy people. I think this is the hardest part! It’s not the withdrawal but it’s re learning to enjoy life without substance. You HAVE to lean into the discomfort. That’s all you can do if you really want to quit and stay off of it. You have to tackle the reason you started. 

I highly suggest reading some quotes or watch some videos by David Goggins and Joe Dispenza. Two very different people with similar ideas on how it’s your responsibility to get to feeling better. It’s all on you. Substance can’t cure our hardships guys. We have to tackle what’s been hurting us head on with full blown emotions. It’s not always withdrawal..... if you need someone to talk to shoot me a msg :) ❤️❤️❤️ and if you’re thinking about using today, please don’t. People love you. I’m right there with you.",44

I'm taking a ton of other  supplements during the day but don't think I can feel them, but they're probably taking a lot of the edge off.  However, exercise is by FAR the most effective thing.  I quit 100g CT without taper for 30 hours and read that someone crawled under their mattress to help the RLS (worst part by far in my opinion). That helped but was hard to get under there,  so today I ordered a 25lb weighted blanket (someone a few months or years ago mentioned it in this forum).  It was so strange trying to squeeze myself between a very large mattress and the bottom part of the bed, but I'd do anything to quell the RLS.

I sort of did the alcohol trick on my last quit too.  Also successfully quit both those times too same way.  Alcohol has never riveted a bitch like opiates so idk for other people it may be different but if you are one of those people who just spent really like it for long like I am I think it could work for people who have genetic sort of immunity to alcohol as I may well have.

For me personally drank plenty on and off with no real reason can put it down without a second thought, even feeling sluggish for a few days then without swearing it off not drink for 3 or 4 months even without trying I don't live with anyone and just don't love it to buy it I do like it with friends at parties when everyone get happy that's how I know I have some type of immunity.

Prescription opiates for extended times in my life led me into the worst pits of hell I never could have imagined and I'd never goes out the windows many times for many people. Thank God for the truth of still nevers.  I pray right now to my creator to give me another chance to prove myself.  I won't even cry until I'm dying because I'll be laughing.  So effing what bad things happen to people all the time but I'm ready to move on be an adult.  I won't be the victim.  I'm the survivor who finds true family and lives again.  If nothing else I can make m laugh too

went to therapy, went on a hike, and did some retail therapy. Im about to clean the floors in my living room and kitchen, which i have been putting off since i puked in there while using kratom and drinking.(thats the ugly truth of it).

Symptoms:
-random fatigue(manageable)
-fluctuating self esteem(kinda normal)
-fluctuating anxiety
-the shits(gross but at least im pooping)
-feeling cold but sweaty at the same time( temperature regulation readjusting)

I'm posting this because I feel like sharing and letting people know that you can do it too, and kind of sharing what symptoms you might have. With most drugs I don't think I would be having physical side effects at this point, but I guess this is the acute post withdrawal side effects. Anyway I hope that you know that you can do it and you're worth more than what you let Kratom take away from you. I felt so much more like myself, although a lot more vulnerable, while being off of Kratom. I have been laughing a lot more. It appears that Kratom was stealing my ability to show emotion and to laugh. In the beginning Kratom was fun and made me feel like I had more energy, but at the end all I felt like doing was staying inside and scrolling on my phone. It really is a tricky one. Like all drugs it gives you momentary happiness and then steals all the happiness that you had from you. If you're looking for a sign to get off this s***, consider this your sign. And if you feel like you might need a little extra help to do it, don't forget that you can check yourself into a detox to get over the initial period when it is really hard. That's what I did and I'm so glad that I did it even though I felt like I was a little bit of a wuss. I'm not a wuss,I don't want to be a slave to this garbage anymore.",8

2021-08-18 21:06:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/p74l8l/has_anyone_tried_this/,Has anyone tried this??,"Hello everyone! 

I have quit about 4-5 times now and want to quit for good this time.

My habit is currently at about 16ish tablespoons a day, all in one sitting.

My withdrawals have usually been for 4-5 days before I’m almost normal, getting the usual insomnia, RLS, and some anxiety with a -99 energy level lol.

Anyways, I have never used anything to help the withdrawals besides regular vitamins and maybe a little glass of wine. BUT I have recently came across this stuff called Cerebrolysin. 

The Cerebrolysin contains a ton of brain growth factors, amino acids and some peptides. 

In theory the dosage of the Cerebrolysin should allow your brain to enter a state of neuro plasticity and allow your body to adjust much quicker to being without the Kratom! ( there is no research I could find on human withdrawal help, but it’s safely tolerated in stroke patients and Tbi patients)

Has anyone else tried to use it? If so, what dosage and how long? 

I’ve been thinking I’m going to do 30ml day one then 20ml day 2 and continuing at 10ML/day for two weeks.

Any comments or anecdotes would be appreciated!",5

I have so many things I’ve wanted to do but my brain has been destroyed by kratom and weed. I have horrible physical symptoms. The mental WD from kratom isn’t as bad for me but for the weed it is. The main reason for my failures and my biggest fear is the muscle/bone pain in my lower back and stomach. It’s constantly aching, it feels old and creeky. Kratom has made me afraid to eat because it kills it, so I’ve lost a lot of weight. I’ve been exercising and eating better so hopefully this time I’ll make it. Fuck it",8

This is my second time putting cold turkey. The first time was 5 months ago and it only happened because I went to a place where I couldn't get it for 30 days (this was not intentional). This was the hardest 30 days of my life, it sucked. It was hell. I was forced to go cold turkey after 30-40 grams per day for 2 years. As soon as I got back home I started again even though I was happy that I quit.

It was impossible to control the use once I began again. 5 months later, I made the decision to stop for good after telling myself for the last 5 months that ""This will be the last time."" I decided that I wanted my life back and kratom made me someone that I was not and made me numb to my life. I did it for me, for my wife, and for my family. I decided I wanted myself back and wanted control of my life. I understood that the peak would be at day 3 and the first 3 days were horrible. I slept maybe 6 hours combined the first 3 nights, it was horrible, the nights were terrible. Luckily, my wife knew I was going through this (though she had no idea of understanding how bad I was feeling). I forced myself to do things, literally forced myself. I kept telling myself that ""you have to force yourself to do things"" and did, even when I felt dizzy and out of energy. Come day 4, I was not feeling anywhere near how the first 3 days were and I decided to ""move on"" mentally. Hell yeah my mind would remind me that I wanted some kratom, but I shut it down quickly by telling myself that I would give my life up to it if I did. And then I quickly shut down the idea and moved on. Im on day whatever, I don't even know, can't be more than 21 but I'm moving on. I have a market below me and it sells kratom and I just look at it and keep going. Im sure I have some lingering affects, but I forgot about kratom, I'm done with it. I want to say that my mindset and intentional willingness to suffer to be free was the reason that this round was better.

I could also just be lucky. But I felt the first round and this round of quitting and two vast differences. Take control of your life or Kratom will without your permission. Love.",7

I realize I’ll never progress in life as long as I am using Kratom. The hardest part is that I am halfway functioning on Kratom. But that is all. Just a mere existence. I came off of heroin in a jail cell over a year ago and went to rehab then to sober living. Im still in sober living. After a couple months out of treatment I started using Kratom (not my first time). I knew it was a bad idea. And I’ve been using ever since. Im just fucking sick off feeling like this.

I just got my buddy using one and he wishes he bought a heavier one and he still loves it so much that he is copying me and buying a 2nd weighted blanket to simultaneously use.

Weighted blankets are also proven to help reduce anxiety and such, which is an added bonus and important when getting off Kratom, which from my experience can cause severe anxiety and discomfort.

Honestly, even if you aren’t dealing with Kratom or other WDs, i’d still recommend weighted blankets to everyone, such a game changer for those who suffer from insomnia!",7

So I took 50mgs of Delta 8 which worked except I get up to pee at least 4 times a night because of having to take Potassium which works as a diuretic. When I would get up my legs would buckle and I was very dizzy and weak.  So I had to be very very careful each time I got up luckily I didn't fall down.  But I worry about tonight.  I also woke up with bad legs. So I am trying to exercise at least twice today even for a minute. I was so happy about getting Delta 8 except I don't want to fall and hurt myself during the night so I don't know what to do tonight and all the nights I suffer with my legs.  I think my legs are worse than normal RLS because I have terrible Peripheral Neuropathy on top of it.  Bummer.

Quick backstory: I’m almost 4.5 months clean from Kratom, but before that I hadn’t had a day off of some form of opiate for 12 years (I’m 34). First it was heroin, then it was Subutex maintenance which became abuse, then it was Kratom. So being sober from all that was an insane shock to my body and brain, and with more than four months clean I’m still not fully right. Energy levels are always in flux, I’m tired often, and have a 6-month-old daughter who doesn’t like to sleep.  So….

The reason I’m posting this is to say the only thing that gives me legitimate energy, makes me feel great and keeps me going throughout the day is exercise. I know how difficult it can be to get started—it’s still so tough for me to build up the energy to do it—but when I’m done I feel amazing. It’s no opiate high, but it’s the best natural feelings I’ve had since quitting.

I was so weak when I first quit after neglected my body for years, but I’m getting stronger every day and look so much better. Just seeing the body transformation alone is enough to stay motivated. 

Obvious stuff, I know… but for anyone out there thinking “I desperately need to exercise but it’s impossible to get off this couch right now”, just do it. The benefits are too valuable.

I fully believe I can do this CT and am going one day at a time.

I am taking MINIMAL supplements and medicinal help. I will have about 7/8 Ativan for the truly horrible moments, typically at night. I have Tylenol and Imodium if needed. I have magnesium for sleep as I have marijuana for the mildly-medium uncomfortable times. I also take BCAAs, creatine, glucosamine, vitamin b6, calcium and Metamucil regularly anyway.

I will be working out (weightlifting) each night as I currently do. I will be making sure to eat SOMETHING in the morning as I currently do not do that. I don't typically eat until 7/8pm each day.

I will be taking a bath each night for the sweats and a shower each morning to start my day.

I have work today, tomorrow and Friday. I have both of my kids on Saturday and the whole family together on Sunday. My fiancée is prepared to support and help anyway she can.

I am drinking water and minimal caffeine. Nothing else.

I don't anticipate the WDs lasting long considering I quit for 5 days in July and have typically maxed out at 20gpd (few extracts) using powder and caps only, mostly. I came off a 50gpd habit last year for 97 days then got back on. Been trying to quit every day since.

As a bonus, if you get a high quality green tea like Gyokuro, it has L-Theanine naturally in it. 

I found the green tea very helpful especially in the first few weeks.

Anyways I'm on day 28 now, I've been out of rehab for 2 days. Meetings have kept me clean since being home. In that rehab bubble I wasn't really having cravings because I knew there would be no way I could act on them. When I got home though, that anxiety and fixation on buying kratom came right back. Suddenly was anxious again, lost my appetite, and felt paralyzed and too scared to leave the house. I forced myself to go to an AA meeting and man did it make me feel better. Everyone is different and maybe meetings aren't for everyone, but for me they make all the difference.

But I wanted to clarify that it isn’t the plant that is to be blamed. It’s a very addictive plant, that regarded as benign in most cases. I believe that’s only cause of scientific evidence that is lacking. I’ve quit cold turkey from a day before that post. I’ve also quit nicotine gum and caffeine.   And I got comfort meds from doctor and talked to him fully that I was dependent on kratom hence, my lack luster efforts to maintain my mental health.  That and a general distrust for western medicine.  But I have to admit In each and every case user errors to blame.  I’m not sure what my blood pressure is, I’m not checking it compulsively anymore.   Plus as I quit hypertensive issues are to be expected. But I will say that my addiction has probably led to some hypertension issues I believe as my dosage increased so did my blood pressure.  With my comfort meds I got my first full night of sleep.  I plan on discontinuing them ASAP as I’m not switching one addiction for another. But I think ima start going out with my girlfriend more and appreciating life behind the lens of not being numb. Now today the clonazepam still had me a little drowsy. So I assume a trip to sams to watch her browse the clothing and just be out and about to appreciate life is all I can manage.

For around a year my tolerance has been so high that no matter how much kratom I take or what kind, it makes me feel like I'm dying (trouble breathing, weak, tired) and even when I take significantly less I have the same issues. 

Around 30 hours ago I woke up feeling semi-normal, which is unusual because I typically feel like I'm dying for the first couple hours after I take my first dose. I was at my breaking point. I've been struggling with kratom for a while now. I can barely function throughout the day, my relationships with people have become distant, all my dreams have felt unreachable because of how shitty I feel everyday.
I barely have the energy to even show emotions, or feel them most times.

But for personal reasons, I got the biggest burst of motivation I've ever had to quit kratom. The first day was hell, absolute hell. I was so lethargic I drank 5 cups of coffee, a monster, took 2 Advil, and took a high dose vitamin in hopes to help the pain and lack of energy. However it only helped for 30 mins or so before I felt like I was going to have a heart attack, on top of the returning symptoms. I took a nap, and woke up feeling pretty normal again,the past 6-7 hours have been fairly easy. I still had slight symptoms after waking up, but no where near as bad as yesterday. I did feel quite lethargic however so I got some pre workout and have taken super low doses of it to keep me feeling somewhat active, and functional.

The battle I've been going through has had me ready to end it all, almost every hour of the day for a long time. But I feel like I'm slowly getting back to my normal self. Finally going to be able to achieve the dreams I've been working on and actually feel good enough to do it.

For anyone struggling with kratom or any addiction: you can do it. It WILL be rough, but you have to push through it, and realize in the end, you'll have your old life back. Much love everyone ❤️",7

Ready to be done with this - last dose is tomorrow,"I've been on about 12-14gpd (liquid extracts) for 1 year now with a 1 month quit in the middle of that year. I tried tapering about a month ago and 2 weeks in I broke the taper because I was either hungover from going out on the weekend or experiencing stress due to work. There are so many reasons why I am ready to quit, but mainly it's that i'm TIRED. The negative feelings associated with the remorse of using combined with the actual decline in cognitive function while on the substance is far outweighing any ""benefits"" from this. It's basically an hour of a buzz/mood stabilizer and then there are no positives, for me at least.

So many of my thoughts during the day are consumed by negative thoughts - beating myself up for my use and seemingly endless failure at trying to quit.

And the worst part is that Kratom numbs your emotions so much that I don't even totally FEEL the negative effects of this thing and I don't really give a shit about any of it while I'm on it. I feel I have lost my personality and I can't even see myself from the outside because I'm so numb and lost in this stuff.

I scheduled a 2-week vacation at the start of September - I believe work is the factor that keeps hindering me from quitting.

What about detox if this fails? I'm highly considering checking myself into a  facility at the beginning of my ""staycation"". If anyone has experience with that or thoughts on it, I'd love to hear more.

I have the following supplements/helper meds: 

gabapentin, black seed oil, magnesium. Any others you recommend?",5

About a week ago I CT from that amount and made it 30 hours.  Now I'm stable at 5g every 5 hours and am able to sleep and function at work. That's like a 75% decrease, I had one day of 7.5g every 4 hours but that made me too high.  I still feel like I'm withdrawing but nowhere near as bad as CT from 100g.  I spent a good $200 on OTC and nootropics mentioned here -- about 15 bottles of different things.  When I finally CT I'll have a couple pharms just in case.  I've quit this stuff a few times before (20g and then 35g) but none were as bad as this 100g.  The 20g I tapered and CT in 1 day with DXM (I had no idea if it would work but it really seemed to).  The next time I tried DXM and it was horrible with the RLS, but the afterglow of DXM really seems to put a damper on it (there are studies on that I think).  I'm rambling now, but I've been playing a game of taking 5g and seeing how long I can go without it.  I have an alarm set to go off every 4 hours and it feels awesome to last longer than two of them, or to wake up at 8am without having to have dosed at 5am like I did the night  before.

I have peripheral neuropathy which makes my legs and feet hurt terribly.  Then I have a problem with my right hip that I was born with and that hurts.  So withdrawals just exacerbate all these areas of pain.  That in itself is enough to make you wanna go on something.  But I do know after I get through this that if I push the exercising and hopefully a good chiropractor and massage therapist I hope to God I can get my pain under control and live again.  All this trauma came from riding and showing horses and from stupid people in Tennessee who backend me four times when I was at a standstill.  That trauma is what fused my neck.  I can't move my neck up and I have to be very conscious of how I stand.  I myself never heard of trauma-induced neck fusion. But I am living proof it happens.  So I have lots of pain for life.

I’m currently on day 4 of my second CT quit and doing much better than my last quit because I’ve stocked up on a bunch of over the counter solutions to many of the withdrawal symptoms. Here’s a pretty comprehensive shopping list of things that have helped get me through my first few days: 

1. Tissues / toilet paper: good to have on hand for the initial runny nose and congestion. 

2. Dayquil / Nyquil: again helps with the congestion and flu symptoms and Nyquil should help with sleep. 

3. Cough drops: will help with cough and sore throat from mucus if these are symptoms you experience. 

4. Magnesium: said to help with RLS and insomnia.

5. Hylands restful legs: again supposed to help with RLS. 

6. Biofreeze: helpful for muscle soreness as well as RLS (for the love of god keep away from sensitive areas….)

7. Epsom salt: I honestly take about 3-4 epsom salt baths a day followed immediately by cold showers. This helps immensely with temperature issues, goosebumps, and especially getting calm and ready for bed at the end of the day. 

8. A few cheap sweat suits: I wear a sweatshirt and sweatpants to bed every night and keep another pair next to my bed so i can cycle when i wake up drenched in sweat. This makes it much more comfortable to go back to sleep.  

9. Multiple sets of sheets: for essentially the same reason as number 8. 

10. Tea kit: drinking lots of hot tea not only helps with temperature issues but also keeps you hydrated and calm. Great especially before bedtime. 

Those are the big things that you might not already have at home. Now here are some general tips and tricks that have helped me:

Get dressed up: understandable on day 1 and 2 to loaf around in your PJs but it may be wise to dress yourself up a bit the following days as this helps (at least myself) feel a little better mentally and like I’m not a total mess. 

Get moving: again after the first couple of days its good to get up and moving and exercise if you can swing it. Even better if you can pull this off on days one and two. 

Create a night routine: turn off your phone and develop a nightly routine that helps you wind down before bed. 

Those are the big ones that i can think of right now. Hopefully this helps some of y’all. Im currently sitting on my couch freezing my butt off and you’re all helping me big time.",18

I posted a few days ago about the scary experience I started to have with Kratom. I had some lovely replies that really helped me. Post was locked, saying thanks here instead. 

Anyways, I am on day 3 of zero kratom. Last dose was like 1.5 grams Saturday afternoon. Havent barely slept at all for 3 nights, but my heart issues have drastically reduced. I am happy to deal with withdrawls over the thought of sudden cardiac arrest.... 

I am sad that I didnt get to respond to someone on my last post. Im really sorry to hear that you lost your dog this year too. I hope one day we can both find something as meaningful and complete as the love we shared with our dogs. Its hard to imagine..I know..
The last thing I said to my girl was that we will see each other again, ""just like we always knew"". If you and me never find happyness like that again...atleast we did once. I miss her so much. Where does all the love go? What happens to all that energy? Its got to lead us somewhere. It cant just be gone. 

Thanks to everyone else that replied aswell. Even the less than helpful comments. It was definetly Kratom causing issues. Kratom needs to be further studied.

+edit to add - I wonder if there is any common correlation between stressful events as ""triggers"" for Kratom to exasperate heart problems. I have read studies that say Kratom can potentially make arymthic heart conditions worse. But it didnt claim to cause the issues. When Kratom turned on you, did it seem random? Were you taking higher doses because of acute stress?

And holy crap. It was bad. Worse than almost anybody else I've read about. Especially the SOUL CRUSHING PAWS. I can't believe I'm still in the throws of it after all this time off. Still get exhausted, very depressed and anxious. Eating certain foods, especially sugar completely messes me up. It like kratom messed up my ability to digest certain foods. And I had legit physical symptoms over a MONTH from quitting! Chills, Rls, fatigue etc. I even recall around day 75 or so I was getting goosebumps, and it was over 70 DEGREES! How is that even possible? I always try to keep this in mind when I realize how slow the progress is with PAWS. I mean if the physical withdrawal lasted this long, than I should expect the paws to last far longer. So it does help in that sense.

But has anyone else out there had such a brutal drawn out withdrawal experience? Especially that paws. Because as long as the physical withdrawal lasted for me, it was much much more tolerable than the mental. So any input would be appreciated. There has others out there with similar experiences.

Edit: had to edit post because I gave the impression that the withdrawal is over. It is absolutely not. It's BETTER, but Paws is still hitting hard. And I still have bad digestion issues. Hair is still falling out, but not constantly. For some reason it falls out more after eating sugar, or just being stressed. Just another weird list of lingering health issues after quitting. Surprised to see so many others having such a hard time with withdrawals as well. At least where not the only ones.",13

Last 5 months of extracts mixed in (which I think is what has made this current quit so intense). Ive had a few unsuccessful quits of 2-3 months. This time around is absolutely the last I want to deal with this nonsense.

The past 7-8 days have been complete hell. I got through the initial burst of acute withdrawal symptoms and then starting on week 2 the anxiety has been unlike anything I've ever experienced. Waves of heart palpitations, feelings of dread, lightheadedness, etc. I have transformed into a hypochondriac overnight after a couple panic attacks (the latter which led me to the ER where everything checked out).

I keep reminding myself that the only major thing to change is stopping kratom.  

This all makes me realize I was probably suppressing any anxiety I was experiencing with kratom. It has all built up over these past few years and now its come out in full force. Its scary to think about. 

Its hard at this point to accept I'm still early in the process and hope that turning point is coming. I'm ready to deal with my issues head on and not hide behind a substance.

Also, cant say enough how amazing this forum is for the healing process. It is extremely reassuring to see all the people who have gone through the storm and have come out the other side as happier and healthier people.",14

So now I am weaning way down and I feel like I'm  always eating, yet always hungry and my stomach is growling.   I have to eat on the hour it seems.  Not gaining weight.

2021-08-17 12:17:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/p672sy/mindset/,Mindset,"Hey all, back again after a slip up that lasted about a month and a half. Heavy binging on extracts here and there for the first month, I was able to go without with no problems so of course I set myself in the delusion that ""I've got it under control this time"" well I didnt have it under control and for the last week or two Ive started feeling WD symptoms. 

This time, instead of freaking out to the point of full blown relapse, Ive decided to adopt the mindset of really wanting to quit. Im doing a crash taper, I was taking anywhere from 10-15gpd just to maintain, but Ive only taken about 1 gram today (with gabapentin and cannabis) and i feel totally fine, good actually!

So this time, i painfully went over all the negative effects kratom has had on me: the depression, the lying and guilt (I have a girlfriend that i love and im too afraid to tell her, but i know i can kick it and still be with her) the sunken face, bad complexion, black eyes and dry/thin hair. I look like shit and i hate it.

I am fully committed to quitting now. I feel like only being a month and a half deep, and having helper meds is going to make this as easy as possible.

My message is this; if you really want to quit, i mean want it want it, make the decision to quit, right now. Taper, CT whatever works, just really focus on how much negative bullshit you have to deal with on that shit and quitting will give you a subtle sense of relief. You are free and done, now just make it happen! So much support here. You can do it I PROMISE you. Just embrace the mindset of quitting and really wanting to be done with the green shit.

I’ve known that my health is at risk, but I haven’t had any issues yet, so no real motivation there. For the last few weeks I’ve been reading your posts religiously, and I’ve realized so sooo many of my day to day issues are linked to kratom. My memory is shot, I have 0 motivation, no creativity, feel depressed, and if I go a few hours without it my wd symptoms are fucking freaky. 

I’m only 22 and I’ve been a daily user for around 3 years. I started at 19, amazing life choice. 

I used to be driven, smart, creative, have so much excitement about life, and now I can’t remember a conversation from yesterday. 

I’m planning to taper, but I’m worried my lack of self control will get in the way.. sometimes I really want to quit, sometimes I forget to give a shit. But your posts have shown me an exciting possibility: life without brain fog, depression, and a humiliating addiction that no one knows about. I teared up reading about your successes

I’m gonna create a taper plan tomorrow, but any suggestions to boost morale and not come crawling back in a week? How can I make myself dedicated to recovery? I desperately want to be free of this, but find it hard to trust myself",11

I have hope,"This day was starting out really humdrum and I had no energy but I managed to get up and do a few things around the house. My apartment is absolutely filthy and I need to get it in order. I also had a bit of a break down and cried out to God. I realize that a lot of the reasons I've been using substances is because I feel so alone. I'm in a period of my life where I've been seriously hurt and let down by people in my life who I thought I could seriously count on. But when I cried out to God (and I cried a lot), I felt so much relief afterwards. All of a sudden there was a glorious sunset and I felt peace and I didn't feel any of the inner turmoil I'd been feeling just minutes before. I don't normally post on the internet all the time but I thought that I would share this in case anyone else is going through something similar, where you feel like you're all alone, and it's the only thing that's holding you together is having something to blunt the feelings that you're experiencing. I truly believe that God cares for and loves us, even though we mess up so much, He's always there for us and He will gladly take you back in no matter how many times you screwed up. And if you've been let down by people, God will never let you down if you have a relationship with him. I hope that the right person who was meant to read this, reads it.

This second time around the withdrawal symptoms were less intense. A good friend was in town and a group of us partied for a couple days which took my mind off the physical and emotional symptoms. 

Day 11 now and I’m having a hard time with motivation and staying positive... Super drained of passion and optimism. Not going to use K but I am concerned about how long this dullness will last. I have a full time job on top of playing in a band and having a list of deadlines in both areas. Some days are harder than others.

Wim hoff and exercise have helped but nothing has helped with the insomnia so far. 

Cant wait to make it through to the other side. Never letting addiction get me like that again. Kratoms temporary motivation has a cost and right now I’m settling up something fierce lol.

Here's What I Think--,"I like to escape!  One way or another I have always found a way to escape.  Drugs and alcohol are a popular way of escaping but so is watching others live their lives.  Whether watching a movie, a sporting event or even the news--it's not me doing, it's me watching.  I'm lazy.  I like to take the easy way out. I don't like to do uncomfortable things.  Kratom was a great supplement for this.  Perfect for isolation and avoiding my real challenges.  

I'm single.  I have never been married and I don't have kids.  I need to meet people, I need to go on dates.  I'd like to thank Kratom for helping me avoid this problem completely.  I have not even talked to a potential date on the phone.  There was one girl who worked at a store who flirted with me.  I was going to go back in and try to talk more with her.  Guess what?  I never did.  I still think about her.  That was like six months ago.  Thank you Kratom, you son-of-a-bitch.

I have dreams.  I have talent.  I went out and I bought all kinds of musical production equipment.  The Pandemic was a perfect time to learn.  I scratched the surface a little under the influence of Kratom.  I even fooled myself into thinking I was working really hard.  I really wasn't.  I was an unorganized mess and accomplished very little.  The one thing I never neglected to do was to take my daily doses of Kratom.  And if I didn't achieve the high I was looking for I took more.  Well, you know the drill.

I'm lazy in the first place.   Kratom made me think I was working really hard.  It brainwashed me.  I was fucking high.  Many times I would stop working, mix some sludge, drink a Heineken 00, non-alcoholic (Yes, I'm not allowed the real stuff, no, I didn't learn) and listen to other songs by other artists and imagined I would do great things someday.  But the future was then and I was high.

But when the Kratom no longer gives you the feeling you used to get from it, when it makes you sick, when you need to have it with you at all times, when you become dependent on it for everything you do, when you look in the mirror and you look like shit, when your face is caved in and your skin is white and you have no one to turn to--you realize you are swimming in a pool of pig vomit and it smells.  

So you start to feel bad.  You start to feel real bad, real sad.  And you look back, way back and you see how many times in your life you have fucked up.  You see all the opportunities you missed, all the great people who are gone from your life.  

They are gone because you pushed them away.  You pushed them away because that's what you do.  But you can't see yourself.  You never could see yourself.  You always did the best you could with what you knew.  It's just the stuff you knew was not enough.  Like Kratom.  How in the hell did I think becoming addicted to Kratom was a good idea?

So I have a lot of work to do.  Because quitting Kratom will not solve all my problems.  I got to break some seriously bad life-long habits.  

But I will say this--QUITTING KRATOM IS STEP ONE!

It's time to take inventory, assess the damages and move on.  I wish that I knew what I know now--when I was younger (but I'm glad I've learned a few things).",68

I had physical WD first and then the mental WD came, I changed my Diet and started eating much healthier, picked up hobbies, and started exercising hoping this would help, all doctors appts went great and I looked healthier than I had ever been, the mental WD went away as well. 

I was a very high energy person before Kratom, and Kratom was my first addiction to anything but eventually it made me become numb and emotionless and that was very unlike myself, I wanted that person back so thats why I quit.

However, after 150 days, after all WD symptoms have resided, I feel exactly like I did whenever I was on Kratom daily. No motivation, no emotions, lack of hormones or something. I'm never sad or depressed or anything, but im never happy or excited either. Like nothing has any effect on me. it's always just numb, and thats how kratom made me feel. Even though my general quality of life has improved, diet, health, financially, socially. everything in my life has gotten better over the past few months, I just don't seem to care. 

Now I'm telling myself I might as well take a little kratom now, since at least it gave me an hour of happiness, And that makes me sick to think about. 

It seems like the only answer would be something in my personal life is effecting me but I can't seem to find out what, like I said, it feels exactly like I just never quit kratom to begin with, are my receptors fucked?",10

I bought Delta 8, have homeopathic for RLS and made soup so I don't have to cook.  What I need hope for is one does anyone has experience with Delta 8 for RLS I need to know it will work. God, I hate that more than any part of this bullcrap withdrawals.  It lasts forever to me.  Second, when do people get some energy back???  I mean I have only been back on kratom for 7 months because of a terribly painful breakout.  But all I want to do is sleep I hate this stuff.  So when can I live for the day I get some energy and can start to function again??????

I hate this but at the time I had the unexpected breakout of an autoimmune disease I had to take something for the pain and kratom was all I had.  I couldn't sit or walk for months without crippling pain and bleeding.  Anyway I should have just shot myself instead of going back on kratom.  But here I am so give me hope for this time around.

You can do it.,"I lurked this board going through my Withdrawals. It was rough. And I'm also a climbing arborist so to say the 5 days of kratom Withdrawals were uncomfortable would be an understatement.
I, much like a lot of you, thought kratom was relatively safe. I used it as a replacement for alcohol. And immediately got hooked. I abused kratom for about 6 months. What got me to quit was noticing one day when I had ran out that a few hours after my last dose, my skin started crawling and I felt restless in my body. That night I couldn't sleep, a fever set in, and I finally realized the severity of abusing kratom. 5 days of little to no sleep, depression, and feeling like it would never end. And finally I'm free of kratom.
This forum was the backbone to my sobriety from kratom. It got me through the worst of my CT period. Now I'm free of it. I thank everyone who posted here. And I want all of you to know that withdrawaling sucks but it does get better! You will make it to the other side! Do not give up or give in. Once you make it through, your life is back in your hands and you can feel proud for being strong.

Im currently at day 21 CT from 30+GPD.
My physical withdrawals are basically gone (sometimes I do feel some pain which reminds me to the withdrawals) - also my mood is soo mich better, I’m active again and I started to socialise again - all in all I do feel a lot better.
BUT often I do feel so exhausted - mainly because I do still sleep super less.
I do wake up around 8 to 10 times during my 6h sleeping schedule.
It’s kinda a restless thing - I have to turn every now and then cause I can’t lie for that long in one position.
It really drives me crazy. I do remember from last time quitting it took me around 6 weeks to get somehow 80% of normal sleep again.
I dunno what to do - or better if I can do anything? 
How long did it take for you to get proper sleep again?

Btw I can’t take sleeping pills cuz I have to get up at 5am and I’m worried I won’t if I do take some.

Long story short it’s been ugly but I’m still here. There were many relapses but never fell back into the pit of destruction.

After every slip there was days of suffering but i suffered through. Many of the days I made it through only can be explained by divine coincidences preventing me from using.

So ya the good news is I’m feeling good I’m 6 days out from last slip and I’ve decided I’m done punishing myself, the suffering has been long enough, I’m getting kind of used to this sobriety thing and there is this momentum that is driving me.

Physically mentally spiritually about 100 times better than I was on Kratom. I’m pretty thin dude and I lost 15 lbs when I weighed myself toward the beginning of this quit. I’ve been going hard in the paint with eating and excersizing and I know I’ve put on some weight the last week or so.

I’m tapering my diazepam, I quit caffeine and kava, but was prescribed Adderall XR for my ADD/ADHD for a trial run (smallest dose possible). While it has helped my ADD immensely (like looking through glasses for the first time - also I don’t get that euphoric high off it, I don’t know why anyone abuses this drug it just makes me feel normal and can do things normal people can do) it has turned me into an emotionless zombie like Kratom did so I don’t see me using this long term and yesterday I had a panic attack on it, but today everything is normal. The reason why I quit caffeine/kava is because caffeine makes me more anxious on the med, and I don’t really need to chug it anymore. As for kava, I don’t know how that interacts with adderall so I’m not taking it. Anyway I don’t see myself being on my meds long term - I think just a few months, maybe less and I won’t be taking it on the weekends as the negative side effects aren’t worth it. Anyways I don’t crave Kratom I’m too busy but I do feel anhenodia right now - as I should. Won’t be drinking or socializing that much this semester which is sad. Focused on school and my health. Wish things could be different, but life has its obstacles and I got myself into this Kratom mess and while I never had an issue with alcohol I can’t do it while my brain is healing. I hope to cope with add/adhd without medication and finding a new psych soon, even though I can’t really process written information as quickly as others and just could never bring myself to clean, take care of myself, etc. I’m feeling hopeless as I don’t want meds - not even an antidepressant… I’m just tired of it all. This semester will be difficult for sure but I’m signing up for the learning disabilities program if I decide to quit adderall which I think I am. Don’t like the numbing effect. Rather feel emotion.

So, let me start this off with a huge thank you to this subreddit. Prior to, in the middle of, and after quitting kratom I was constantly looking at posts on here for help and reassurance. Seriously, you guys are awesome. You've all helped me through one of the most important parts of my life. Anyway, enough with the sentimental stuff :3 just gonna share my story. Sorry if it gets lengthy lol

I had a horrible habit with kratom that started in 2018. Initially, I used the stuff for the chronic anxiety I started suffering from after having a mental breakdown at college, but it wasn't until about a year later that it became problematic. I went from using 5-6g a day off and on in the beginning, to downing 50 to maybe even as high as 80 grams per day a year into my habit. For almost the entirety of 2019, I was living at home doing nothing but getting high on kratom, eating shitty food, and watching videos.

My first successful quit wasn't until December of 2019, which was agonizing, to say the least. The story is crazy and will probably take up a huge chunk of this post lolMy family was going on a vacation to Poland, and since kratom is illegal there, I figured it would be the best (and only) time for quitting. So I went for it, and I was going through pretty awful withdrawals by the middle of my flight. After my flight landed, however, not only did I still have the horribly uncomfortable withdrawals, but airport security detained me at the metal detector. Basically, my dad had used my coat when he went to a shooting range earlier in the year, and I didn't use the coat so I never checked the pockets for any bullet casings or anything. Yep, turns out there were LIVE ROUNDS in the pockets. So I had to spend a night in their jail. While withdrawing from a 30-50g per day kratom habit. On Christmas Eve. It *sucked,* and it was definitely a rock bottom moment in my life. My physical withdrawal symptoms were (for the most part) gone when I woke up on Christmas morning. Despite residing in a jail cell with some Georgian guy that couldn't speak English, I felt insanely relieved. I was let out of the jail after having them talk to my family, clearing everything up, and paying a fine. The rest of the trip went okay, considering the circumstances. My emotions were all over the place, as you can imagine.

This quit only lasted about two months, believe it or not. Out of utter boredom I started kratom again, right before quarantine started. Just like that. I had enrolled in community college classes to try and get back into my school, but as soon as the kratom habit started again, I blew off my classes completely. I swear that kratom turns me into a lazy husk of a human being without any effort at all.

Around May last year I noticed my hair was beginning to thin. It actually started thinning many months prior, but I hadn't noticed until looking at pictures. My first reaction was that I was dealt a shit hand in genetics, and I denied that it was the kratom habit. Somehow, despite the hell I went through during my kratom use and withdrawal several months prior, I was defending the awful habit. After a good 8 months of rapidly thinning hair, constantly sitting at home during quarantine, and more crappy eating, I finally realized I had to quit kratom and never develop the habit again. Funnily enough, my reason for quitting was mostly for my thinning hair more than anything else.

February 1st of this year marked my first day off kratom, and I slipped up more than a couple times along the way. Though quitting wasn't nearly as difficult this time around in the beginning physically, the long-term mental effects were overwhelming. I constantly had intrusive thoughts for months, and at one point I even wondered if I had OCD. These worries are what would eventually lead to me relapsing two months in, just for a day. Then the same thing again a month later, then another month later. Every time I would try it again, the guilt would be massive and I would throw out the bag the next day and proceed to feel crappy for several days after. I would even check to see if the one or two measly doses I took had made more of my hair fall out. The kratom would only make my mental problems worse. As of now, I haven't taken any kratom since early June, and tempting thoughts like ""Ehh I'll just buy 10 grams, I feel like shit so I deserve it. It won't cause any harm"" are completely gone. I barely even think about kratom anymore besides looking back on my progress and helping my friend quit. The intrusive thoughts are also much more manageable, though I might see a therapist about it.

Amazingly enough, my hair is also getting *really* thick again!! A ton of white hairs sprouted up a few months ago and lately they've started gaining their pigment. It's awesome and I feel like myself again, but also a new person. Even though it's a bit vain, I feel so happy that quitting has had very concrete physical results, it just took a looot of patience. Recently I cobbled together my savings, moved out of my family's house, and rented my own apartment with my best friend from college, and I'm about to start working a full-time job. My life feels more fulfilling than it has in several years.

The absolute biggest help in my quitting process BY FAR has been exercising and eating a reasonable diet. I was lucky that I didn't have a job while quitting, because I had an open schedule to start improving myself. While I was on kratom, I would have massive cravings for mostly processed and sugary foods (unlike a lot of people, I actually gained fat on kratom, though I did lose muscle weight) and I had no desire to exercise at all. I'm sure my testosterone took a massive hit because of kratom as well. Now since March, I've started running and working out at the gym and nothing could have been better for self esteem and overall health. Seriously, even if it's the only productive thing you do all day, exercising will make you feel more confident in yourself than a toxic kratom habit ever could. I also somewhat lost touch with my friends while in the middle of my kratom habit, as it started making me very unsocial. Hanging out with them much more often over the past few months has been very therapeutic. Just keep yourself as busy as you can!

Welllll... this post became way longer than I thought it would, I'd put a TL;DR but I'm not sure how to condense it all lol I understand if a lotta people don't wanna read an essay. I hope anyone quitting or about to quit or falling off the wagon can get some inspiration from this. I want people to know that quitting the habit *for good* is absolutely doable, and that it is totally normal to slip up along the way. And if you've lost hair from kratom use, *it will grow back!* Be patient and don't give up!!",54

Ready to quit.,"Hello, I am long time lurker but finally decided to come forward about addiction to kratom. I've been sober of alcohol and pills (save my Ativan for my major anxiety attacks). I thought I could take kratom occasionally, but I just can't. It's run me dry of money and I wake up in wd. It is also blocking my thyroid meds and my thyroid isn't getting any better. I do take my synthroid on an empty stomach, but for how much I'm taking (40 capsules a day, I don't know the grams) I know it's the root of it.
I have gone a day or two without it, but like many here, had rls and insomnia. 
I plan to quit after I get my refill for Ativan so I can take it to sleep at night while I go through wd. 
I am sharing this here because I've been going through this alone, no one except for a friend who also uses it knows. I appreciate any words of encouragement. Thank you for reading.",14

We’ve all joined this community for a variety of life situations. One of the reasons it works so well is because we respond and help without judgement.

A cashier could be helping the CEO of the company where they are both employed.
A teen could be helping a grandparent.
A homeless woman could be helping a socialite.

This platform was built to make us blind to our biases. We cannot see race, social status, sexual orientation, gender, so our default mode (at least in this forum) is empathy.

We help because we don’t get in our own way. And this, at least to me, is unbelievably beautiful.",61

Those really, really helped me work up the courage to quit so I want to return the favor. Not only does it get better but it gets exponentially easier too. Happiness comes back, you can feel ""normal"" again. 

I used kratom regularly for about 2 years until I started to realize I had developed a real problem. At my worst (right before I went CT) I was taking 12-18 grams a day, so not as heavy usage as some posts I see here but I'm still hoping this will feel relevant/helpful to someone.

Before I went CT:
My mental health was going downhill from the kratom fucking with my brain chemistry as well as the guilt and stress of having ""done this to myself"". I was depressed, my digestive system was screwed up, my thoughts were consumed and I was suicidal at times. I was sleeping (poorly) 12-14 hours and struggling to wake up without getting real rejuvenating sleep. I occassionally experienced restlessness in my abdomen at night, it would feel like ants crawling around in my stomach and would keep me awake until sunrise sometimes. When I did sleep it was becoming harder and harder for my boyfriend to wake me up each day - it started to get mildly disturbing. I'd have whole conversations with him when he'd try to get me up and not remember any of it. 

I felt lost, I felt scared to face the issue and stayed in denial for a long time. Once I owned up to it internally I put off doing anything about it or telling anyone else, telling myself ""now's not the time, things are too stressful/uncertain right now. Next week for sure."" I hated feeling the way I did and I missed happiness - *real* happiness. I was terrified I'd never be able to feel it again and that fear alone was enough to scare me out of even trying. 

Finally one day something compelled me to bring it up to my partner who had been a kratom user too. Deep down I knew our habit wasn't sustainable and I told him that exactly. I brought it up sort of casually in passing one day; I told him I felt we should consider quitting or at the very least I should, to focus on my health, especially if we planned to start a family someday. I blurted out that I wasn't sure if I could do it on my own and suddenly the dam just broke. I burst into tears and it all came spilling out. I told him how scared I was and how alone and ashamed I felt and I think that was the first moment I realized I wanted to be 100% done with it. He took my hand and we promised we would try, together. He wasn't nearly as bad off as I was but agreed that it was better to nip in the bud now. 

That was 3 months ago, we stopped cold turkey and neither of us have looked back since. Sure, I had cravings but having a fixed goal of zero grams everyday kept me focused; there was no wishy-washy ""maybe I'll have a little but I'll just make sure it's less than I had yesterday"" crap. 

Detoxing:
The first 5-7 days were the worst, I had raging diarrhea almost immediately and splitting headaches every day. I made sure to drink as much water as I could stomach and kept NSAIDs within reach. I spent time outside, I let myself cry it out, I did guided meditations. To my own surprise, I discovered I like some types of ASMR (which I always scoffed at but now HIGHLY recommend) and that got me through many of the rough patches of anxiety and intrusive thoughts. The physical withdrawal symptoms subsided after 4-6 days and the psychological ones mellowed out after a week or two. I still had my ""idk why I'm crying but I just feel sad. Will I ever feel happiness again??"" Episodes maybe every other day for a few weeks (if you're quitting too let yourself feel those emotions and cry them out, crying releases oxytocin and endorphins). Those episodes became shorter and exponentially more bearable every day until I started to feel like I had a grip on my emotions like I used to! I was having fun again as long as I was distracted. 

Around the 1 month mark I started noticing that the daily cravings turned to simple passing thoughts. Now sometimes a whole week will go by without it entering my thoughts at all. And when it does I sort of just think ""huh, kratom. Sounds fun, also sounds like a living hell. Glad that's over."" 

4 months ago I was miserable, suicidal, unable to use the bathroom like a normal person, losing weight from stress, unsure my brain chemistry would ever regulate, terrified I'd feel devoid of happiness forever. Here I am now, newly engaged to my partner who also quit, excited about the future, persuing a brand new career, happy and laughing again! 

I absolutely feel like a brand new person with the confidence and willpower to continue conquering it.

If you're here lurking unsure of whether you're ready to quit, this is your sign.

Side note: I honestly can't stress enough how much ASMR helped me. If you're unsure about asmr and think it's weird (I did too) shop around anyway because there are tons of different types and I'm sure you can find some that will ""do it for you"". I discovered that I love the sounds of colored pencils and drawing with no talking for instance.",22

The bruised feeling went away but progressed into a ""heavy chest"" feeling. It scared me and I started tapering immediately monday. I also cut out my daily red bulls and also replaced dabbing with rso. Now on day 7, I think I now need to go cold turkey as I am still experiencing heart racing/jumping. And this ever present kind of dull pain in the bottom of my chest. 

I have been using for around 2 years I think maybe a bit less. The ""scoops"" I get from one brand say they are 3 grams each. I kind of suspect 2.5. I take 2 or 3 scoops 4 or 5 times a day. Or atleast I was. I have never had any problems besides upset stomach. I am pretty healthy and active. But I did just have a traumatic day two weeks ago of losing my dog. My best friend in life. It happened suddenly. It caused great stress I cant talk about it without crying, and I was taking heavy doses more often for sure. 

I started Kratom to help me with a bad drinking habit. It worked really well and has been awesome. Untill now where i feel as though Kratom has turned on me. 

It seems like I can kind of just lay down and calm myself. And i have been drinking a lot of coconut water for the minerals. It seems to help, but it still seems like my heart is beating to hard or much. Its scary. I know at this point it seems to be kind of a common ""event"" Kratom users experience. Today I took 1 scoop in the morning and half of a scoop about 5 hours ago. The worst of it was during some exercise of picking blueberries with my dad. My heart was beating hard and weird  and i started having bad anxiety. Then we had a bite to eat on the way home. I took the half scoop before lunch. And also had one beer with lunch. As I got home my heart started racing and beating and it was quite a long episode of bad heart racing. I had to lay down and looked at the costs of ekgs and where to go.... I opened another can of coconut water. That seemed to help. And in the past few days it "" seemed"" like tumeric capsules helped with chest pressure.

So Idk....I am hoping to contact someone who has been through this to tell me they made it out and didn't suddenly die?? There is a thread that is two years old with people with similar experience but it stops 2 years ago aswell... I am wondering how they did??

Also any feedback or info is great. This group has made me feel more optimistic already. But I am very worried. Should I go in and get checked out??

Thanks",6

I've attempted to quit CT 4 or 5 times throughout the 7 years I've been taking this garbage(8-10gpd) and always caved around the 2-3 week mark when suicidal depression from PAWS hit me like a semi-truck. I'm extremely happy to say I'm over 2 weeks in and I don't feel depressed. I still feel kind of bleh, but it's not even close to the other times I've quit. I don't have any overwhelming urges to hurt myself or any suicidal thoughts!  

I'm not sure exactly why it's been so much easier this time. My mental health is in a much better state but I think the taper has been a huge factor as well. I'm not trying to knock CT, I think whatever way you can successfully quit is ultimately the best and what works for me might not work for you. But wow. Tapering has changed this from some monumental, impossible challenge into something that seems completely doable. I can't recommend a good taper enough. If you've only gone CT with no success, try a taper! I never used to think I had the willpower to stick to one, but here I am. You just have to really want to be done with it, stick to your plan, and constantly remind yourself of why you decided to quit.

High dose vitamin c sodium ascorbate was another key in the first 4 days. I was up to 28000mg a day. Now I'm at about 5000mg BID.

I'm attending a recovery group at my church now and I'm going to start back with a therapist also.

I've quit three other times which each only had 1 to 2 days of withdrawal back when I was using much less, but the RLS was too much and I had to work.

I began doing 5g doses 5 times a day, but I think that was too fast, so I switched to 7.5g 5 times a day, but the peaks and valleys were too much, I wanted a more stable taper.  Now I'm doing 5g 7 times a day (every 3 hours) and I think that's the sweet spot for me.  I don't get too high and don't get too low before the next dose.  I'll lower each dose by .5 to 1g every week and then try jumping when comfortable.    Oh, with my previous quits I found swimming to be extremely helpful.  I don't have access to a pool now so I'll try  running.",6

Any tips?,"Hey guys, so I’m a 21 year old male and Ive been using kratom for a little over a year and a half. Started out with using it to help me manage my stress and It worked pretty well in the beginning. I did my research on this stuff and I have to say I was pretty deceived by all the positive information I read about it online. It seemed like a miracle substance with very few negative effects. At first I was a huge advocate for the stuff but lately I’ve started to notice that it is taking a toll on me and I need to quit now before things get bad. None of my friends or family know how much I use this stuff and a lot of them don’t know I use it at all. Because of this, I need a support system to help me deal with this issue which is why I turned to Reddit. If anyone can help me (give me advice, support, tips, etc.) it would truly mean a lot. As of right now the only withdrawal symptom I really notice is anxiety and some weird feelings in my stomach. Thank you so much for your help and please feel free to message me.",17

2021-08-14 11:31:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/p4a4wl/tapering/,Tapering,"I finally got a scale to measure what I've been taking. I usually make caps so I've just known how many to take and what my good dose was. So I would take 6 caps 4x a day. Which equals to about 10.5 gpd (I've taken more here and there on long nights etc. but that's been my usual dose all my years of taking it. I started K to quit subs I can't go the route of getting help meds. But I have all the vitamins mentioned.

I jumped down to 4 caps 2x a day which equals to a little less than 4 gpd. I know it doesn't sound like much and I should probably just jump off but I'm terrified. I have VERY bad depression and am so worried it'll come back when I thought I had it under control. I've also been told by doctors when getting off antidepressants that I'm very sensitive to withdrawls symptoms.

For some reason the night time is when the most arise. I feel restless in my arms and legs. And very yuck in my stomach and body. But the one I can't handle is sweating. I am wearing sweatshirts in the dead of summer for fear of people seeing how wet my arm pits are on my shirt. It's just pouring out of me.. My forehead doesn't get sweaty I am not hot(besides being in a sweatshirt outside but I'm talking inside)
I'm not hot at all actually cold on my hands and feet but my arm pits are steady dripping. 

Due to the K and in-between doses I would get a little clammy and sweaty. But I don't understand because I didn't full quit and it's flushing out of my system.. but this alone is making me want to just take the jump and try not to take anything at all. I can't sweat like this thru a whole slow taper.

My reason for quitting alone is my hair. I have long hair. Used to be thick and straight. Now it's broken frizzy and so damaged. Also I put no color in my hair. Any color has been grown out and cut off over the years but my hair feels and looks like I bleached and fried it off. It almost hurts to.. its weird but if I wear it up I feel it pulling and popping right out of my scalp.

I came to reddit and found someone talking about the same issue and it was k related. I came here to find SO many more symptoms I have. They call K sludge. I've never felt something be described exactly how I felt. While on it it would give me a boost of energy but over time I just started feeling like a lazy person. But I know I'm not. I have a family and tend to the house the bills work school I don't have the choice or chance to be lazy but I have been.. its been so hard to get up and do anything because I feel I'm just trudging thru sludge my legs feel heavy. When I have to bend down it seems it's such a task. It's ridiculous honestly and that's another good reason I've found to quit.

From my jump I already feel some positive changes. I do feel this wind of depression blow in and I get up and try to listen to music or go keep busy. But I feel a little more clear headed-ness. I feel more get up and go in me then I have in awhile.",9

Wow! Can’t believe how much sleep I managed to get. I think the biggest thing that helped was magnesium. I also used Valerian, CBD, and Melatonin. By the way, I’m the guy who took the train to Wisconsin (where Kratom is illegal) from Chicago to get away from the green sludge. I posted a couple days ago for those who remember. 

A little about my use: I used pretty much only extracts this last year and a half of use. It started sometime around the beginning of the pandemic. Started at 1-2 a day . The last several months, I have been up to 4-5 day, and even 7 on some days . I haven’t been able to save any money in spite of having a career that pays me well. 

About to go down to the hotel gym to see what kind of workout I can get. Will probably be mostly walking, but that’s better than nothing.

From drinking the sludge to wake up to drinking the sludge to go to sleep, it was the key ingredient to getting anything accomplished.

Organize all this paperwork, without the sludge?  Are you fucking out of your mind?  Watching educational videos and being creative--without the sludge?  Do you know how fucking impossible that would be?   Going to work, driving my car, talking on the phone, the dishes, the vacuuming--without the sludge?  Preposterous!

Do you have any idea just how boring watching a movie or a football game would be without the sludge?  Video games--without the sludge?  I don't think so.  The whole world.  I don't care if we are going to Hawaii, Vegas, Disney Fucking Land, without the sludge it would fucking suck!

Bored and unmotivated.  That's how I feel.  That's the way it is.

Yes!  Because I have strongly established a life that relies on Kratom and now that it's gone I have to learn all new patterns of doing things.

Someone told me it takes doing something 14 times before it becomes a habit.  So I just got to force myself to watch 14 mindboggling boring movies before I can enjoy one.   That sounds miserable but I guess it could be done.  Fourteen straight days of forcing myself to try to be productive even though it will be a dreadful and tedious experience. 

Establish new patterns!    Okay!   I'll start tomorrow.   I know.  You know.  It's fucking hard!",24

Just wish it would get better. anyone have similar experiences? might just have to relay to my therapist that it appears I need prescriptions to function in this society.

Before quitting my libido was extremely low. Sex drive was basically non existent and needed to use Cialis just to get an erection. During my ""honeymoon"" phase with Kratom the first couple years i would get rock hard and could last forever, although I often had trouble finishing I rarely had difficulty with achieving an erection naturally. But that changed for the worse over the last couple of years. 

Now at day 4 can finally get an erection naturally but I can only last like 2 minutes until I bust lmao. Has anyone else ran into this issue? Does it get better with time as your hormones and receptors stabilize back to baseline. 

Kratom definitely had an impact on my testosterone levels and also noticed it progressed hair loss/thinning and my hair grew extremely slow while taking it. I thought it was just me but after some research i realize this is quite common. 

Withdrawals at the dosages I was taking are mild but definitely noticeable. Hot/cold flashes and sweats, decrease in appetite, lack of motivation/interest, diarrhea, increased anxiety, a bit of RLS. But am managing wd's fine with Xanax and valium, and Dexedrine for my ADHD. 

My biggest concern is how long will it take for my dick and sex drive to get back to normal lol.",2

I posted here not long ago about my three-day quit. That same evening I caved. Under the familiar guise of it not being a big deal.

The smartshop where I got my Kratom has some really nice personnel. I've been talking to them about my struggles with the substance and they've been very understanding. I finished what I got in one evening. The next day I went back. The same guy was working there, and he asked if I was sure I wanted to get more. I actually very much was not, and smiled at him, said no, and walked out of the store.

All I needed was someone honestly questioning me at the right moment. Since that moment I feel pretty confident that I can quit this. On the surface that may not say much, but the last 2 to 3 months I've been filled with fear about how Kratom hooked me. I was thinking about it all the time. It was like a shadow looming over me almost constantly. That fear is replaced with resolution and confidence.

Now on day five. Weirdly sneezing. Still not feeling great in the morning, but I'm starting believe I very much can get a similar energy to that of Kratom complete naturally, without any drug.Because Kratom can be pretty subtle, it's possible to kind of replace the high with natural ones like music, exercise or yoga. Eating healthily. Trying to see people you love. Living a good life.Kratom's relatively light effects compared to some other drugs can definitely be a pitfall as you keep excusing your use and you can function on it normally, but it's also an advantage in some ways. Double-edged sword.I've been diving into relatively obscure 80's music, I'm making a mix, and it's been an incredible support. Soothing my soul. So finally I want to share these two 80's gems with you in the hope it might offer some support to you as well. If you feel like it. You can find them both on YouTube and Spotify.

The good news is that nearly all of my symptoms are gone. The physical stuff is totally absent now, except for the occasional yawning and watery eyes. The mental stuff is a bit of a different story. 

I’ve complained of brain fog this entire time, and unfortunately it’s still an issue. But it is getting steadily better. I get several hours at a time now of lucidity. It reminds me of trying to take a picture of something in focus on my phone’s camera. Like how you can touch the screen to choose your subject you want in focus, and then that subject starts moving so the result is that you’re chasing around this object that is forever going in and out of focus. That’s me. I’m the camera and the focus is my literal focus during the day. And my life is constantly oscillating between blurry and clear. Not sure when this ugly phenomenon will end. All I can do is gauge its presence as it slowly begins to dwindle from my life.

Aside from brain fog, ive also succumbed to the usual feelings of boredom. Kratom was what I used to make everything (especially menial tasks) more interesting, so it’s not totally uncalled for that my life feels less colorful without it. I find myself making to-do lists and FORCING myself to get out and participate in life. It’s not been easy, but I’m managing.

I’ve been keeping myself busy with exercise mostly, and I credit what progress I’ve made, recovery-wise, to it. I run every morning. Lift weights every afternoon. And walk when I have the time. The only thing missing is a truly clean diet, which I plan to enforce over the next few weeks.

All in all, I’m doing all right. I only think about kratom now when I’m bored, and the cravings are mostly gone. Im still disgusted that I let my habit go on for as long as it did, but there’s nothing I can do about that now. We have to learn to forgive ourselves. I believe most addicts struggle with this. 

If you’re in your first couple days or weeks, believe me when I say you can do this. I was so convinced I would fail that I had money set aside for my relapse. I never needed it. If I can quit, so can anyone. I promise. By day 5, things will seem laughable. You can manage this. I believe in you.

More than anything, let’s forgive ourselves. We made a mistake. We screwed up, maybe for years. But it’s okay. 

Forgive yourself. You deserve that. I deserve that. We… deserve that.",15

But mostly i'm finding myself pacing and thinking a thousand miles an hour. It's starting to wear me down a bit. Went for a run, helped for about an hour after then im right back to it. Maybe a should just run till i cant move anymore. Half of me likes this newfound energy, but at the same time i cant seem to focus it. Wish i could explain it better. Ealier a started flailing about and screaming haha(trying to make it go away), that helped as well. But my poor dogs were terrified and worried, so i wont do that again. It almost feels as if my body has got its energy back but my mind is still in a pit. Anywho, im still doing good. Today is just really strange and surreal.

2021-08-13 14:27:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/p3r2ii/very_little_talk_of_probiotics/,Very little talk of probiotics?,"I tried googling this and can't find many posts on here about probiotics.

Which is surprising because kratom surely must mess with the gut flora.

I've just started taking a probiotic supplement and I am also making my own milk kefir. You can buy the powdered culture on Amazon and you just add to milk, takes about 1-2 days to turn into kefir depending on how warm it is kept.

The kefir can be remade after each batch by adding some of the old kefir to fresh milk. So I usually drink about 1-2 pints of kefir every 2 days, if it suddenly gets warmer outside then I have to speed things up a bit.

But you can always put the kefir in the fridge to slow things down a bit if you don't want to make a new batch immediately.

The reason I am mentioning this now is because I'm starting to feel much better, like I'm climbing out of a hole psychologically speaking 3-4 days after starting probiotics.

There are some bacteria which have been shown to boost dopamine and serotonin in the brain, 90% of serotonin and 50% of dopamine are created in the gut. The main one I found was called L. plantarum, but do your own research.

Another added bonus is that many people here struggle with gut issues related to digestion and pooping, well probiotics really help that side of things, kefir's effects in that department happen pretty much within 24-48 hours for me.

Wanted to share this as I think it could help a lot of people to get some probiotics in their diet and/or supplement regime.

Of course, life is about balance, so exercise and clean diet are key also.

And eating fast food feeds the bad bacteria in the gut, so make sure once you get your gut in order that you don't immediately mess things back up by eating sugary and fast food crap.

It’s been hard but not as hard as the past attempts. I think this is because of the supplements I have been taking and because I have been active at least 4 x a week.

This is what I did to mitigate the effects. This worked for me and I hope it works for you. 

I tapered down for a month. I got as low as 4-6 grams a day. Sometimes I would only take 2 grams just to prepare my body. For this entire month I took the following supplements:

Morning with or without breakfast 

Lions mane & Reishi powder with morning coffee. (Brand: Real Mushrooms, 1G each)

Vitamin D3 ( Brand: Nature Truth, 1 gel cap 2000IU)

L-Theanine (Brand: Nutricost, 1 capsule 200mg)

Alpha GPC (Brand: Toniq,2 capsules 600mg)

Ashwagandha (Brand:Yourtheory, 2 capsules 1000mg)


Afternoon
 
Magetin (Brand: now, 1 capsules)

Kava Gold tincture(Brand: Sprouts, 45 drops into a 16 oz bottle of water)

Vitamin C (Brand: 365 Whole Foods,1.25 grams)


Night time (restless leg/ arm is almost non existent)

Ashwagandha (Brand:Yourtheory, 2 capsules  1000mg)

L-Theanine (Brand: Nutricost, 1 capsule 200mg)

Magetin (Brand: now, 2 capsules)

Melatonin (Brand: Nature Made Extended Release,1 tab 4mg)

Galantamine (Brand: Dream Tech, 1 tab 4mg)

Kava Kava ( Brand: VHnutrition, 2 capsules, 1400mg)

I would also drink sleepy time tea before bed with honey.


Other:
DHEA and Longjack but this was more for a boost when exercising. Being active is very helpful. Try to run outdoors or on a treadmill. The runners high feels great!!!



For anyone out there struggling:
You will get through this. Time heals everything. This shitty feeling will pass. The first week is crap but once you are passed that it gets better. Stay strong and keep yourself busy. 
Go back to doing the things you love and rediscover your true self.

Between rhodiola rosea, blackseed oil, MJ, and ohh yeah baby a lidocaine patch. 

Background.  I was kratom only but with the stress of coronavirus, neighbors constantly attacking me, feeling overdone by the plant, taking too much to balance my depression lack of energy, losing weight and finally a 2 day relapse I realized I have to get rid of the heavy kratom doses weighing me down that way I have something like kratom to relapse on if that makes sense.  

I do think it can be a weapon in the arsinal for sickness and realpain but when abusing it every day I'm just not getting much out of it anymore.  

Been dropping here n there for a couple weeks leading up to the relapse. After the relapse I take 1-2 grams a day just for some relief.  Tomorrow will be half a gram.  Just trying to get used to it.",3

I just wanted to tell people that it’s ok to ask for help and to take some time out of your life to commit to recovery. I’ve tried quitting at home many times and just couldn’t take it anymore. The constant battle with myself was exhausting. It feels refreshing to just submit and get help.

I’ve been posting about my journey since quitting on 7/30, following a rapid two week taper.   I’m happy to say that MOST of the acute stuff is gone… I am still dealing with some stomach issues, sleep irregularities(although SO much better), and fatigue (honestly the worst part for me).  RLS has finally subsided, but I will say it took almost the entire 14 days for this to get better, but it was definitely manageable after about 7 days.   

First and foremost, my key to success was admitting I could no longer cope with my crippling anxiety and I entered an intensive outpatient program for co-occurring mental health/substance abuse treatment.  I luckily was able to taper and jump on my own from 30+ gpd and I will say that without the therapeutic tools and helper meds, it would have been nearly impossible for me.   Quitting on your own is amazing and I have such respect for those that have done it successfully, but if you are someone who is struggling just know it’s okay to get help!! ❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹

I have severe lack of concentration, I talk too much and ramble, my brain is fogged up, can’t get out of bed, forget to text people back, forgetting to take my meds (Prozac and Valium). I think I have Alzheimer’s. The Valium is certainly making the brain fog worse and I have short term memory loss I think… I’m also disorganized, can’t bring myself to clean or take care of myself, procrastinating… I don’t feel anxiety anymore, just numb. It’s definitely a combo between PAWS and Valium, and just my underlying mental health issues coming back in full swing. I had a psych appointment today (was 30 minutes late) with a new psychiatrist I was hoping to help me. Sadly, was told that I needed rehab and hospitalization (um, why?) and to take time off school. Sadly for her, I don’t operate that way. I’ve been told many times over the past year I can’t do things. It only drives me harder. Last year I was in rehab and my parents said I wasn’t ready to go back to school in the spring. Got a 4.0 GPA. Best semester yet. My fitness professor in June for running said i wouldn’t be able to pass the class as I was out of shape. Got the best running time out of all the class (I was the only girl too with 25 other men), running on a stress fractured foot. During the first two weeks of CT, couldn’t imagine getting it this far. Still have Kratom in my room. Yes I’ll get rid of it don’t worry I have to clean tomorrow anyway. I just don’t even think about it or crave it. This whole Kratom quit though has me not wanting to take meds even though I may need them. I had to really restrain myself from flushing my all my Valium down the toilet (yes it’s prescribed to me, I don’t abuse it, but I did on Kratom because Kratom was like a gateway drug almost). So I’m doing a slow taper. Was prescribed a tiny dose of adderall XR to treat ADD/ADHD, and even though it will certainly help me focus, take care of myself and function like a normal person, I don’t want another drug to take. I’m tired of it. I don’t even want to take my antidepressants. Or caffeine. Terrified of any mind altering substance. Anyways I’ve been in bed all day unmotivated and procrastinating, but I will fight this. I can do it. I’m tired of meds (even though they’re prescribed to me). I’m just angry at all drugs. And tired. Sleeping all the time despite not taking enough Valium as I forget or just don’t want to. I’m mad at psychiatrists I’m mad at myself being stupid at 18 and taking this shit thinking it was a harmless plant. To hell with drugs not just Kratom. I was prescribed an antidepressant at 10 years old. TEN. Brain ain’t been right since.",9

Based on most estimates, the conversion is roughly 60gpd. I am taking no helper meds/supplements with exception to my normally prescribed 60mg Vyvanse. 

6 days ago, I started a taper using the extracts measured by using a liquid syringe. Each has 8ml of extract. I started by cutting the dose in half to 4ml, at my normal timeframes: This would be a drop to roughly 30gpd. 7:30AM-12:00PM-5:00PM-9:00PM. 

I felt no real effects until the morning of Day 4. I woke up at 4AM with the typical WD symptoms of RLS, runny eyes, yawning and heaviness. I took my Vyvanse at 6:00AM and the WD abated to barely noticeable except some sweating. 

Yesterday, I dropped 1ml more to 3ml, 4x/day. As of today, no significant effects other than slightly noticeable WD symptoms right before my next dose. I will keep this dose for two more days and drop another ml. 

I believe the Vyvanse is helping significantly. Mentally, I have had only positive effects. I can feel emotions coming back and my mind is clearer. 

I was expecting far worse and suspect it will get there eventually but for now, each day I feel more confident than the last. I will keep you updated!",5

I was sneaking around taking kratom after I told my girlfriend I quit. About a year into our relationship, she told me she was uncomfortable with me dosing. I told her I would stop. Well, that lasted about a month. I began sneaking doses in, gradually moving up to 30 gram doses 3-5 days a week.

I was saying I was going walking to get groceries. I conveniently left out the part about getting cash back from the grocery store so that charges from the smoke shop didn't register on the card. I also left out the fact that I would walk to the smoke shop after getting my bottle, down it on the way back home, and then throw it away to hide the evidence.

Last Saturday, she found my stash of empty bottles that I had from times when I was working from home. They were hidden away deep in my drawer of my desk. Completely accidental find on her part.

I am SO. FUCKING. GLAD. That she found them.

I rationalized all of this stuff away as, ""It's not that big of a deal, I wasn't really lying, Its not that bad, I can control it.""

We talked at length and she cut right through my little addict rationalizations. Uh, yes sneaking around, hiding purchases, lying, and taking drugs is a major sign that something IS EXTREMELY WRONG.

I don't even understand how I thought it was okay. I always told myself, ""You aren't that bad, you can stop any time."", ""You aren't an addict, you aren't strung out in the street somewhere"". That was a lie. I've been lying to myself for the past four years about my addiction.

I'm done. I'm done with kratom, and I'm done with alcohol (7 days sober from alcohol).

I'm going to NA meetings, researching about addiction, have accepted the fact that I am an addict and it is literally life changing.

No more fogginess, I have extreme motivation to do things that I stopped wanting to do, sex drive is back like a mother fucker, I can actually concentrate on getting things done.

I still have that little voice in my head that says, ""Come on, just one dose won't hurt, take a walk really quick to go get a bottle, it won't hurt"" (or, ""Just go grab a six pack and drink it tonight!"")

I shut that voice down. I shut it down hard. Every time it comes up I immediately tell it ""No, and also, go fuck yourself.""

I am so glad that I had the ""cold bucket of water splashed in my face"". What the hell was I thinking?

No withdrawal symptoms other than what I assume is restless legs. I feel a tightness in my abdomen/chest when trying to sleep and have to move around to get comfortable. About 10 seconds later it happens again. I don't care though. I deserve it for being so blind to my own actions.

Thanks for all your posts. It's nice to be able to relate to others who have the same thought patterns / understanding about how terrible this drug is. I'm so ready to be clean and sober that it isn't even funny. 

My relationship is on the rocks, but it doesn't matter. I know what I am and I now know what I need to do.

I'll leave you with my favorite argument from my girlfriend after I said, ""I don't think I even need to go to a support group, because Im not that bad!""

""You were sneaking around, lying to me, taking drugs in secret. If those groups aren't for you, then who the hell are they for?""",14

And now, all that remains—that I didn’t have before—is a little tinnitus! But here’s where, in my opinion, the *big* struggle begins.

I’m back to running every day (aside from these heat waves), cooking my elaborate dinners, and not being an asshole to loved ones. But…damn, I have no idea what to do with my life—I’m right back to square one, only unlike before COVID, my seasonal/remote job and the small overseas business I own are all gone, for the foreseeable future. 

I’m back to questioning everything, most painfully, certain interpersonal relationship decisions (that seemed like a great idea during my quarantine abroad and my misadventures in self-medication). In short, I’m back to being the over-thinking, underachieving, constantly dissatisfied (what a shit combo!) person I’ve been for a while, and I’m paralyzed again. Therapists-psychiatrists near me seem to be booked up, and the unemployment well is about to dry up. 

Do I still think about kratom? Yes. I don’t think it’s inherently evil. It is addictive and dangerous, but I blame myself and my lack of caution—I’ve abused alcohol and, well, plenty of things on occasion for 25 years, but I knew not to get addicted to anything. I’m disappointed that I can’t use this plant for occasional “therapeutic” use because I told myself it was safe, and ignored the first couple of times I woke up thinking “ohhh… this feels like some sort of withdrawal? Nah, can’t be!”. 
I long for the certainty, confidence, hope, and gratitude that I’ve just never been able to cultivate within my own brain—because I’m pretty sure something is wrong upstairs, though Wellbutrin seems to help with some of it.
My road here started with social drinking as an introverted kid, but that threatened friendships and relationships over the last 20 years. I wasn’t in love with alcohol, but it definitely knocked down these barriers that kept me from confidently interacting with other people. Then a “sober” friend introduced me to kratom, which seemed like a godsend…allowing me to FEEL all of these things in my heart—processing grief & guilt, ability to focus, exuberant energy, pleasure, gratitude—until it didn’t anymore. I became a weirdly vegetative but active being (yes, seems oxymoronic). I’m glad I’m not in the grip of any substance, and I truly can say that I’m not and have never been an addict, even though I slipped into this dependency that I quickly recognized and fought almost immediately (thanks to you all)—but I’m well aware that this could change, depending on what I do next. Here I am at those crossroads that I saw off on the distance last year. Medicating? Self-medicating? Meditating? I’m stuck in my head and can’t seem to get out.",16

Side Note, Battle he's going to overcome!","Little backstory.  I like to drink.  I started noticing that I was getting a little out of control/depressed/embarrassed with some things I was doing under the influence.  To help me drink less often, I started taking some pain killers here and there.  I then came across my Moms Tramadol and started taking those daily (son of the year).  She gets these as often as she needs by her doctor.  

I was on Tramadol for a year give/take.  I knew I wanted to get off that stuff and I thought I got lucky when a friend showed me Kratom.  Kratom seemed to fill the Tramadol void and I no longer felt like a POS for taking my Moms meds.  I looked up Kratom online and like many of you, didn't want to find the /quittingkratom site but instead looked for the benefits of K.  Bad move.  I now can look back and see I was in denial of the negative effects.  

I ran out of K in like November and remember feeling sick.  The next day I recognized the symptoms.  They were Withdrawls.  I decided to stop taking it and wasn't expecting it to whip my ass.  I broke down, cried, felt ashamed that I got hooked by some shit you get at a headshop lol.  After a couple days I got some more K.  I thought I only took a little but my dumbass never thought (or I did but was in denial) to get a scale.  I just started using a teaspoon.  Never knew how much was in a spoon until I decided I had a problem and got digis to taper.  

After awhile I thought that the withdrawls I was feeling was just me maybe coming down with a cold (Denials for the millionth time).  I was later introduced to Liquid K.  Started abusing those.  Started taking 1-2 of those a day.  I felt fine doing that for awhile.  All of a sudden I started waking up clammy needing to take a sip of the extract to get to sleep.  This was my wake up call.  I knew I was hooked.  I was feeling embarrassed and trapped b/c I would have to plan out how many bottles of extract I would have to buy so I would have some for road trips or parties.  

Finally in June I stopped getting extracts.  I went w/ only powder.  Tried to figure out how much I was taking but I still was just eyeing it out like fucking idiot.  Then on July 6th I decided to get digis and weigh out my doses.  I didn't know how much I was taking.  I just decided I'd cut down to 13 GPD.  THAT whooped my ass.  I thought I was just hungover from July 4th but the hangover kept on going for like 10 days.  I think I was taking a lot more than what I pretended to be taking.

Here I am today, at 6 GPD.  Feeling a lot better.  I've been able to sleep decent for the last 1-2 weeks but the last 2 nights have been amazing.  I'm not longer waking up at 5-6 am jonesing for a dose.  I've actually slept til my alarm clock went off.  I'm still tapering down but I do see that I'll be off this sooner rather than later.  

Anyways, I just wanted to share my adventure.  This site has really helped me.",11

I’m 3 months and a week CT off 30gpd, 2.5+ years using kratom. It’s been a ride. The acute withdrawals weren’t great...insomnia and achy body, headaches, but it was doable. Anyone on my level thinking of quitting, do it now! I haven’t touched or thought about kratom since. I became so bad that I was disgusted and over it. But here’s the kicker...

I started drinking several weeks into my quit. I’ve never been a drinker, only on special occasions really. But the “addict brain” is real and I wanted to warn y’all. Constantly being high on kratom left a void to fill...how could I live without escaping my reality and traumas? I don’t drink as much as most alcoholics...about a six pack a day. But three beers right when I wake up and three in the evening. I’m on this slippery slope of substituting one substance for another and I can feel it. Please do not do as I did. Being sober is hard, and often we will reach for “something else” just to escape. I could care less about kratom. But now, I care about alcohol. I’m on the mend, but heed this warning...don’t reach for any mind altering substances. Because being an addict, you will cling to whatever it is and it will substitute your kratom use. I’m working on the alcohol problem and may have mild withdrawal in the coming days. The last thing I wanted after withdrawing from kratom was to become dependent and withdrawal from another substance. So please heed this warning and stay absolutely sober. No escapes from life. Exercise, yoga, meditation, anything but turn to another substance. 

Hopefully I can nix the alcohol this week and get back to sobriety.",17

I own a marketing business and I’m almost always on my computer. The computer or any electronics for that matter are the worst, the words and pictures on the screen seem to be really fuzzy, especially when I try focusing hard. 

Anybody else had this sort of experience? 

Oh and I’m a 4 year Percocet user who switched to Kratom and have been on that for about 5 years with my highest dosage reaching around 18gpd. I should’ve jumped off Kratom a week from transitioning off pills, it would’ve been SO much easier.

I've read diarrhea can be a withdrawal symptom and my gut has always been finicky and more geared towards the runs, but this is frickin' awful.

After going through cold turkey WD I got bit by a tick and had the bullseye and fever and all. Two weeks on doxycycline really kicked up all the physically WD symptoms again but I didn’t go back. 

On Monday, my mom called me and told me my father was hemorrhaging from his brain. 3 hours later the doctors said it was not that but instead vertigo. Misread the cat scan. Such a whirlwind of emotion, but again I didn’t use. Even some fighting with the wife which was always my trigger, and I haven’t even really had a moment where I seriously considered it. 

I’ve tried to quit so many times before this and it never stuck. I’d use the tiniest excuse to justify using. Covid didn’t help. Just more anxiety for an already very anxious person. I don’t know why this time I was able to hang on through the withdrawals. I don’t know why this time I haven’t gotten in my car and said fuck it.

I wish I did cause I know many others are suffering as I did for three whole years. But I can say that I feel great. I’m a better man for it. A better husband, father, teacher and everything else I do.

Long story short I had a Panic Attack about 5 years ago and developed PTSD to severe generalized anxiety disorder coupled with obsessiv thoughts.
this is for sure a big reason why this addiction became so bad. it made me feel safe and comfortable in my skin and was able to distract myself all day every day being very entertained by myself.
But it simoultaneously increased my anxiety in a weird way, it's hard to describe. 

but this wasn't the only side effect I experienced. from the start on even and lower doses I experience a complete loss of personality through emotional numbness and developed severe insecuritys through that. 
So I obviously staied home all day every day for the last 3 years because I couldnt connect to anyone anymore.

i had a very stable support group watch it happen with empathy. but the patience is running out understandably.
I would lose anything then.
seeing it happen while practically doing nothing made me very depressed as time went on. and ad I more and more realized that there doesnt seem to be any hope it got extreme.

so here I am terribly depressed and there isn't any choice but to quit. i think about it every day up to all day. I hate Kratom, it destroied my life and the effects make me so drastically different I cant stand that.

i am taking 30-50g a day and laying in bed distracting myself all day ever day.
i don't enjoy it but it isnt as much tortchure.

i think the worst thing ist not being able anymore to being just on myself sober when I try to stand WD.
I dont know what to do I get insane from boredom.

But I can see some light because as I said, I hate the effects it has on me. Mostly im just a boring cloudy mess and I want nothing more than my personality and Connection. And clearing up can be enertaining.

But I have to change my behaviour completly from one day to another when I get sober. I cant stand watching youtube videos or any of that at all without kratom. 
All that while im disgusted about myself and feeling guilt shame and a lot of anxiety.. 

I dont know, it logically doesnt seem possible at all if im serious but I want it soo bad.

But I have no choice, im in a killing myself type of mood and I know im Done if I dont quit even though I have pretty straight dreams and opportunitys I ""just"" have to get sober for.

For getting sober you have to believe yourself that you are capable but I lost all my confidence and sense of self that this seems Impossible of a mindset to achieve.",7

Now on day 2 I drank some coffee again like and idiot and I started to feel like chest pain ish again so I took a clonidine and now I feel much better. 

Overall I feel not terrible just super low energy. Although my resting heart rate is still pretty high 


My main question is if I we’re to take one  .1 clonidine like once a day for 2-3 days would I be alright or would I still need to taper? 

And has anyone else noticed being overly sensitive to caffeine suddenly?

I have been taking kratom for about 4 and half months and I want to get off. I'm currently taking about 20-30 gpd it was higher but I realized a.higher dose is not always better..so I was extremely Into the gym before I started and realized unlike others I am gaining alot of weight and I want off this shit. What do you think I should do just jump cold turkey or wein off? I have detoxed pills and heroin before so I'm not new to it. I had 4 years clean and all of a sudden thought I would try sonething new. I need to stop! I also was wondering what the vitamins I can take to help with the withdrawal. Thank you.,2

I only take about 15-18 GPD. But I've been doing it since last October. Only just the last few days have I noticed that it's extremely difficult or impossible to achieve orgasm, as well as having kind of sore muscles for no reason.  I did just get over a pretty bad cold last Friday (maybe it was covid, who knows?). 

I would really like to quit and last time I did i felt really ready for it, and I was taking about as much as I am now.  

Could this be from the kratom?

But my first new normal day at home trying out a new routine because yesterday I had to get up and go to the MAT appointment. 
I made some coffee this morning for that energy booster I am used to having. For 13 years I drank a cup of coffee first thing in the morning to get me going. Just one. Well, I always fixed a second but barely drank out of it🤷🏻‍♀️But still did it every morning🤦🏻‍♀️
The coffee didn’t do what the kratom did. 
Onto the second part of the story then I will tie them together: I learned last night the suboxone dose I was given could cause more problems than it solves. 12 mg. I definitely see that since I definitely felt some euphoria. Very dangerous and I am serious about wanting to be sober. I have thought long and hard about this for years now. 
I decided to wait until I started to withdraw then take 2 mg at a time, and start my taper off the suboxone immediately. 
But, because I can’t wake up, I am taking 2 mg of suboxone now to see if it will make me feel normal. The plan now is 2 mg every morning and only as needed at other times. 
Because the half life is so long, I think this is reasonable?",13

Current struggles, thoughts, and goals.","Okay so I said I would check in again. I feel like 1 week is a decent milestone. So far this week, I've had anxiety but nothing to the point of not being able to do anything. The heart racing has subsided for the most part. Sleeping is the biggest issue for sure. The other night I took a couple gabapentin and melatonin and still had a hard time. I wanna try and work on the sleeping issue as naturally as possible..but it's very hard.

As mentioned before I am a 32 female who has used kratom for 3.5 years. My hair has thinned and honestly I look fucking sick. A lot of people began to comment toward the end of my use. I was defeated and done. My physical strength was deteoriating and my mental well being took a huge turn to crying spells and severe depression. 

I got real with myself. Had 5 days off and made the jump. Returned to work (I am a waitress at a busy establishment). Work was awkward and a little hard. Talking to people was weird. But a few days in I felt like I was slowly hetting my groove back. One of my managers commented ""you have extra spunk today"". My boyfriend has said ""you are laughing more, more talkative, more present, I can see the changes already"".

I guess what else I've noticed is my hair is still falling out..im resorting this to the shock my body is going through and trying to not get overly concerned. I know growth will take time. Maybe months or years. Patience.   I also have been having pretty consistent diarrhea but am staying plenty hydrated. If it's really bad I take an antidiarrheal. I'm also taking consistently: probiotic, calming multivitamin, vitamin D, calcium/magnesium/zinc vitamin, vitamin C, biotin, fish oil, melatonin, and collagen peptide protein powder.

Eating lots of protein and vitamin enriched foods and drinks with lots of electrolytes. I just hope I'm not doing too muxh because then you essentially just eliminate it and cancel it out. I am a smoker..ive noticed I went from a pack a day to about 3/4. Another thing that's next on my list is quitting smoking. I want to start during yoga but am going to wait a bit. I am 5,1 and 99 lbs. The thinnest I've ever been. I previously (about 10 yrs ago) was bulimic. You'd think this is a dream come true for me being this weight, but I looking fucking God awful. I want to gain atleast 10 lbs. 

I'm just being gentle with myself. 1 day at a time. I guess my concern now is I initially started taking it to curb my urge to drink. I'm slowly noticing the urge to drink is increasing. I've had a few beers a night here and there to calm anxiety. It works yeah, but I feel even worse the next day. I don't want to go down another treterious path of dependence on anything else.

AA is starting to look like a better idea. I was in AA for years and I can honestly say, it was the happiezt, healthiest, and the most successful I've ever been. AA was really hard at first. The first few years I felt like I was in a new high school environment but with a bunch of unstable people. You literally feel like you're making friends all over. And it's hard. I've had plenty of meetings where I felt like I was still alone even though I was surrounded by people with similar experiences. Crazy right? But a common feeling from what I learned talking to others. I didn't get AA or reep the benefits until I dove right in and submerged myself for the first year. Things really took off from there.

I guess what I've seen is you need a balance. I have seen a lot of people get so involved and dependent on AA and are struggling to function in the real world. ie; maintaining a job, having healthy relationships, being able to do just regular productive things and being a solid contributor to society. Those whom were successful in staying sober were those whom worked a solid program but established a life outside of AA that was positive and healthy because they figured out a balance that worked for them. I guess my advice from experience..is if you're struggling..it fucking works if you work it. Emerse yourself in it for the first year but also look for hobbies and things outside that will also be a positive impact. 

Sorry for the rant. And I'm basing this post of my experience. In no shape or form am I trying to tell anyone what to do or am a professional in the matter. Just what I've learned and experienced  over the years.",12

I tried to jump at ~80 to 100gpd with no taper. I made it 30 hours. I decided to take a 10g dose (1/2 my 4 to 5 day dose of 20g). I don't think I can do that level of RLS for what, 10 days? I have supplements and even pharms on the way (clonidine, gabapentin, vitamin c, black oil or whatever that is) but they won't be here for a few days. I figured I could try to taper down to 10gpd just so I can sleep, maintain and then jump off again in a week or two.

Regarding RLS, I think I have a good way to describe it to people that haven't gone through an opiate withdrawal. I can't stand how it's often compared to having the flu. If only. Here's how I'd describe RLS and the worst parts of withdrawal. You know that feeling when you have a body part like and arm or leg go to sleep -- that awful tingling feeling when you move the limb and blood starts coming back in? You briefly have to just live through 5 seconds of torture. Well, RLS is like that feeling but for days on end. It's not a pain, a sickness or flu-like. Much worse in my opinion.

2021-08-10 22:13:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/p23qjs/day_44_ct/,Day 44 CT,"I wanted to check in today after dealing with (and overcoming a severe bout of PAWS that lasted a full week. I posted on Day 20 in somewhat of a 'Pink Cloud' phase. I didn't anticipate this quit being such a drawn out roller coaster. I recognize that I was a poly-addict, but kratom was my true achilles-the cheapest, most accessible, most justifiable, but also the most damaging to me physically and mentally.

After my last post, I gained a little momentum, started making some healthy life decisions, channeling some energy into artwork and continued with my treatment-started a small dose of an SSRI, which has helped marginally-honestly not too sure. At about Day 33 I fell into a deep rut with PAWS. I was restless, dismissing my treatment, lost in racing thoughts, wanted to turn the brain off yet couldn't sleep when the time came. I had thoughts that life was better with kratom, I couldn't sleep on or off kratom, might as well take it, etc. 

Days 33-40 seemed like kratom's final sales pitch to go back to it. I made the mistake of trying to jump back into work a little too much too soon-same people, places, triggers, etc. In it's peak I used kratom morning to night-usually about 4-5 doses/day around 20-25 gpd. I was always on it and always had to have it on me and going back to the same work environment without it felt like I was on another planet.

Knowing how easily I could go to the gas station and take it made the cravings persist and test me more than I thought. I've had night sweats and insomnia this whole quit and I wondered how much longer I could go on. My mind couldn't focus on anything other than drugs, the Trazodone and Clonidine I had didn't work, and I felt like I couldn't face other people. It took all the willpower I had to get through it. I told myself that if I can get through one more hour sober, that's all that matters and a win. Hour by hour, I made it through a day, then another, then a week. I'm lucky that I have exercise as an outlet and when the cravings would get too intense, I would run, lift, or box.

I allowed myself to remove myself from situations and not worry so much about the consequence or perception, step away and do Wim Hof, cry and get angry. I knew that I had been an addict for a year and a half and that I couldn't expect to be ""cured"" in 44 days. Last weekend, I was able to go up to the lake and swim, ride jet skis and be outside. With that, I started to enjoy nature and suddenly the cravings faded a bit. I was able to laugh, sleep a little bit more, eat and just let things happen. 

I know that I will not be out of the woods anytime soon, if ever, but the strength I gained from making it through the last bout of PAWS will help me the next time it comes around. Stay strong everyone!",11

Very weak. Thought I was sick(maybe I am as well IDK), started getting brain zaps, literally just got one while typing this, I said no way its kratom, I don't remember having such bad WD last time I quit. (tbh, now that I think about it, I dont remember what is was like quitting it at all last time)

Sure enough other people here have reported it. It's pure stupidity I thought I'd be able to use it responsibly (unlike all my past experiences with all substances ever...including my last experience with kratom, LOL). Think I just lied to myself

Took some gabapentin I had lying around, already had my pathetic morning dose (IDK how much but think a spoonful vs 15 spoonfulls), was going to take more, but it doesn't sound like WD will lead to seizures or fainting.

However, the fact my pupils were normal non-crackhead size, I knew my antidepressant wasn't working the last month while I was abusing it. If the SNRI had somehow been inhibited by the Kratom, but is now no longer, I wonder if there is a risk from serotonin syndrome if someone tapers inconsistently as their meds being to work again.

Relapsed last week for a few days, so I'm considering maybe saying fuck it, going cold turkey unless I physically cannot sleep (had some serious stomach uneasiness that made it impossible to sleep even on Seroquel but a very small amount seems to stop it)",1
2021-08-10 20:57:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/p22hpl/ct_5070_gpd_covid_wd_motivation/,CT 50-70 gpd + Covid + WD + Motivation,"Hey all,
I have been reading everyone’s posts for awhile, and this would be my first post. I quit CT, and it has been a month. I was probably taking around 50-70 gpd, for around 4.5 years. I honestly loved how productive it made me, and it didn’t interfere with my life on the surface.

Originally I quit because you don’t know what is actually in kratom or how it processed. But later I realized that I had lost touch with things that I love to do, all I would spend time on was work. When I quit I really felt like I had wasted my life, and I had no purpose. 

The 1st week was the absolute worst I have ever felt in my life. I started feeling horrible by 8am on the first day, 12 hours without kratom. I had almost every symptom that has been named on here plus more. I also had covid at the same time which probably made everything worse. Because of the covid I couldn’t exercise or leave the house. That 1st week so bad, that it traumatized me so I even have nightmares about it. It has been very motivating for staying the course, which is a positive.

It has been really hard to concentrate, but anything is better than what went down the first week. I was off the first week, and I always work from home, so I could hide behind covid. After 1 month I feel like I have turned a corner but definitely still sad/tired, but I am so relieved to not feel the way I did before and thankful I don’t have to deal with that ever again if I so choose.

Here are some things that motivated me:
1. Having someone to help encourage me really helped me build the confidence to follow through with the quit. There was times I was totally ready to give up just to feel better for even 5 minutes.
2. Taking a long time to think about when I started the habit, and really dissecting the why, from the surface to the really deep reasons that I was afraid to admit to myself.
3. Associating kratom use with the ultimate pain. We are fueled by 2 things: Pain and Pleasure. Every action we take, we are doing it either to avoid pain, or to enjoy pleasure. This is an essential part of success because this is how our brains are wired. This is why so many people often jump to other substances to quit the previous.
4. Continuation of point 3: Thinking about what I could do in my life other than quitting kratom that would bring me pleasure and make me proud and start working on it. You need to find a new obsession to occupy yourself. It could be anything! 
5. Exercise and listening to music is probably one of the only things I could do to achieve a higher feeling in the immediate future. 
6. Trying to do “fun” things, especially after the WD. If your life continues to lack pleasure aka “suck” then you will be back where you started.
7. Recognize and purge my limiting beliefs about whether or not I could/ can do this. You have to take action and take control of your mind. 
8. I will never feel the same. Accept that you will never consistently feel “up” everyday. We are not robots, and we have good days and bad days. What goes up must come down.",17

Losing all of my sense of self. Just for a few moments of feel good and a sense of less worry. And that’s what it came down to. The highs last way shorter and I don’t even enjoy them as much because the second it starts to wear off I feel enraged. I’ve lost a part of myself in this short time, I’m in debt, I am completely out of control. My last dose was yesterday at 2pm (idk if that means clean time starts the next day or your last dose), and I feel horrible. So much white knuckling, I’m waiting impatiently for the tobacco shops to close so I can’t rush and grab some. My back pain came back ten fold, I just feel awful.

Been a little over 3 months now. Wish I could get on here and say things are great but I can’t do that.. yet. 

My brain fog is terrible still, seems to have gotten worse recently tbh. Never been so hard to get out of bed, and working is extremely difficult with the fog along with health anxiety going on from all the symptoms that are persisting.

I have seen many posts of people with brain fog on here, and many seem to improve after a couple weeks or months. I have yet to see someone who had brain fog for over 3-4 months AND got back to normal eventually.

If this is you, reach out, bc it’s hard to think that this will ever go away at this point. As an engineer, this is detrimental to my professional career. I need my brain lol. Just can’t stop worrying about this being my new permanent state of mind.

Also, I sleep 7-8 hours a night, physically fit, 22y/o male, weightlifter, and eat a healthy diet (Even though this is all very difficult w no energy).

Sorry to be such a downer, just one of those times in the process. Wish I was feeling better now after 3 months being off K.

Thanks and best of luck to you all!

Edit: I know I shouldn’t be feeling great by 3 months or anything like that. I am just asking for someone who’s dealt with it to maybe give a little hope or insight as to if/when it gets back to normal.",11

Trying to be at peace with the way I’m feeling and trying to be super gentle and kind to myself the way I was in my early days of withdrawal. That helps. ❤️

I peed in a cup, they took blood, we talked about withdrawal symptoms and they gave me 4mg. It’s a pill that dissolves under your tongue and you can’t spit or swallow your saliva until the pill is completely dissolved, 10-15 minutes. She came back and took my vitals etc to make sure I handled it ok but I was still yawning and sweating so she gave me 4 more mg. Same process. Sent me with a script. I have to be seen once a week for urinalysis and to have the prescription filled. I am on 12 mg/ Day. 

When I left, it honestly felt like I had taken a dose of good clean kratom. It gave me the same head change and energy and now that it’s been a couple hours I am a little sleepy. 

Kratom does the same thing as the bupronepherine in the suboxone, in that it binds to the opioid receptors but there is a limit on how “high” you get. Then this medicine also blocks further pleasure feels from taking more opioids. 

This is looking like a good decision for me. I get to doctor assist taper. It’s the only way I could do it. I don’t have the self control to do it otherwise.

I had blood work done yesterday, as well as an EKG, all of which indicated that my heart is healthy. I'm in this vicious cycle where my heart is pounding and I'm anxious, and then I worry that this is never going to end or is not a normal part of withdrawal, which makes the anxiety worsen.

Make sure you get enough water.

I’ve kept my addiction to this stuff real quiet for about 4 and a half years. I’ve only acknowledged and accepted it to myself. I figure it’s about time I admit it publicly…albeit online and anonymously.

I’ve been taking kratom since late 2016, and have been using daily since at least 2017. I take a lot. Like more so than I’d admit because it’s embarrassing. I like it a lot, and have certainly been using it as a crutch. I haven’t had too many overwhelming side effects from it. In fact, I’ve actually been as creative as I’ve ever been since COVID started and have been helping friends with their projects. But I think it’s about time for me to part ways with it. I’m a young guy (23) and I have stuff that I wanna to do with my life. Not that kratom was preventing me from doing that (actually, quite the opposite), but it has become a gigantic pain in the ass to deal with, and I’d like to get back to how I felt when I was 18. 

To any hardcore drug addicts (heroin, fentanyl, oxys), has kratom withdrawal been easier to deal with as opposed to withdrawaling from those “harder drugs?” I’ve even read some comments that have said that withdrawals are WORSE than heroin. Like Jesus
Fucking Mary and Joseph! That’s scares the fuck out of me.

I’d also like to emphasize that kratom is the only drug I’ve ever been addicted to. I understand addiction is pretty much subjective, so everyone’s experience will be different.
I just think some perspective from
hardened Drug veterans will help me through this.

Thanks.",5

Depression sucks, got diagnosed with adhd today but turned down the meds, as I want to be able to control adhd without a stimulant (minus caffeine lol). I was using Kratom as more of a stimulant (only 8 gpd) and mood enhancer (helped me with boredom of school at first), didn’t even think for a second I was misdiagnosed with bipolar and actually have adhd. Anxiety has subsided substantially (except sometimes my heart rate is a little up in the mornings but it goes away). Anyway I wouldn’t say I’m in hell 24/7 anymore but the depression can be unbearable. I’m vitamin D deficient (as well as Iron deficient anemia) so I’ve been taking vitamin D3 supplements as of yesterday and hopefully I’ll see some improvement from that over the weeks/months. STILL haven’t thrown out the Kratom but I have a problem with getting things done and honestly the cons of taking it outweigh the pros HEAVILY! Especially since I had a seizure on it and I honestly don’t even know what’s in that garbage so I don’t see myself taking it ever again, it terrifies me especially in my last few days where everytime I’d dose I’d get a panic attack. Anyways I’m severely depressed but I’ve always had depression so… time to work on that with healthier coping mechanisms.",17

So if you have quit Kratom or if you are trying to quit Kratom at least celebrate that.  

I screwed up my entire life and then got into Kratom to ease the pain.  It didn't go well.  So now I'm on Day 2 without Kratom.   I feel a little hope returning.  More importantly, even if the pain is awful I feel going back to Kratom will only make it worse.

I'm going on a long walk up a steep hill, literally.   I mean, seriously, I'm going to exercise.  I feel icky but so what?  Whatever!  At least I'm not on Kratom.  So that's a good thing.

I just took my last dose. I go at 9 a.m. tomorrow  for a MAT (medication assistance treatment) appointment. 
I have gotten so much information and hope from this group that I decided to post my journey with the hope I can help someone else. I also realize I am going to need the support. 
I am 40 days shy of using kratom for 2 years. As I took my last dose it hit me- it’s not just the withdrawal that’s going to be tough. This is a habit. I am not only physically dependent but addicted. This is going to be a lifestyle change. And a hard one. 
I have been an addict for over 5 years now. It started with pills. I got through that somehow. I got pregnant is how. I did good throughout pregnancy and breastfed for a year clean of course and the day after I weaned him I went hardcore and did the unimaginable- I don’t think I want to say it but it was fast and the worse way to do it. Getting off that was tough. But I did it because my ex took my oldest two kids away and I went to an outpatient rehab. I had to pee clean to get my kids back. 6 months of that. But I started taking kratom to help me through. Almost two years later- here I am. 
My kids deserve better than this. I deserve better than this. I am excited to reach my potential and see the person God created me to be. 
I started partying when I was 15. Quit at 24 when I got pregnant with my first child. I was sober. Sober sober for 11 years. Then somebody sold me some pain pills for a neck injury I had. 
So, like I said. Tomorrow is my appointment. I V am out of kratom, and super excited to not spend anymore money on it! I know this forum will be one of my most valuable tools along the way.
Nice to meet everyone:)",19

I have been using extracts for a good year and a half during this run. Five years ago, I used powder for a couple years and was able to get off that for a couple years before relapsing.

I don’t remember it ever being this hard to get just one day off Kratom when I was using the powder. The extracts have completely pulled me in. You will see that I have posted “Day One” several times, but I never was able to make it through the day. Somehow I managed to get 14 days roughly two months ago before relapsing due to a large amount of work

Today, I booked tickets for a hotel over the boarder in Wisconsin for this Thursday through Sunday. I live in Chicago where I can buy Kratom at nearly every corner in my neighborhood. In Wisconsin, Kratom is illegal, so I will have no access to it once I cross the boarder. I am taking a train as well, so it will not be easy to come back across the boarder. 

I have not been tapering, but will try to the next couple days before leaving Thursday. I bought myself a new laptop so that I can continue binging Better Call Saul (just started season 2 - freaking awesome show), playing LoL, and attending virtual NA and AA meetings. I also will bring my running shoes so that I can run / walk along Lake Michigan. 

While the withdrawals will suck, I’m going to treat myself well and enjoy my time there. The hotel is along the Lake, so I will be going on lots of walks. I will try out new restaurants and seek out other forms of entertainment. Best of all, I will be checking in with this amazing subreddit. I love you all. I look forward to sharing my experience.",16

Kratom was what I thought of as an intermediary between sobriety and crippling addiction which I am grateful for having. I just don't know how to be happy without drugs I guess. Every day during this withdrawl I've been using like 750mg of thc edibles daily. Am I just putting off the discomfort or am I getting off the kratom painlessly. Also if sobriety is the goal eventually then why am I using weed to thus extent right now. Maybe I'll just use the thc until all the withdrawls are over but maybe I'll always feel like shit without a substance unless I break through a full month completely sober,1

I was on day 3 of my taper at the time of writing it. Today I thought I would write a bit of an update and what my experience has been so far. Maybe it will help someone just starting the long slog. 

Here’s a short recap of my addiction:

Kratom user for almost 4 years who is addicted to Pure Alkaloid Extract Liquid Tincture (I won’t say the company name but their product is very strong stuff) at my peak I was taking around 35ml+ a day. Each ml is equal to roughly 3 grams of leaf but in a much more concentrated form. So you can say I had a daily habit of at least 100+ grams of leaf. When I would wake up in the morning my withdrawal symptoms were akin to that of OxyContin or Heroin withdrawal (which I was 6 years sober from at the time of starting Kratom) 

When I started my taper I was in a very dark place and was set to be financially ruined by my $1200+ a month habit (you can read my other post if you want more info on this and other aspects of my addiction) 

So here’s how my taper has been going and where am I today:

I am currently on day 65 of my taper and have went from 30+ml a day down to 4.5ml a day. My current dosing schedule is .75ml per dose taken six times daily (I was taking 5ml per dose six times a day when I started).

That means I would have to take 40 of my current doses a day to equal what I was taking daily 2 months ago! Which is insane to me. If I took that much now I would be sicker than a dog. 

I came up with a dosing schedule that works for me and my job (I work 12 hour days). I take one dose when I wake up and then one every 3.5 hours, then one before bed. I DO NOT deviate from this schedule! I never take a dose early, not even a minute early (but I do sometimes take it later when I’m busy and not thinking about it) 

My drops are always the same. When it’s time for a drop I take off .25ml per dose which equals to -1.5ml a day. During the first 4 weeks when I would do my drops the 1st day was decent, the 2nd day I would be counting the minutes to my next dose, and on the 3rd day I would feel more even. By the 4th day my body had usually reached its baseline. I usually give it to the 5th or 6th day before lowering it again. There were times when I would wait longer to lower it if my daily schedule was being disrupted (travel, changes in my daily routine etc). The trick with tapering for me has been daily consistency and patience! 

Starting at around week 5 I barely even noticed any differences in my body when I dropped. Day 2  is still slightly uncomfortable but that’s mostly mental I think. I still keep the same routine though.  

My plan is to take the doses down to .25ml per dose and then begin to take away doses from my schedule until I am down to only one dose. Then jump off. 

I need to break the habit of taking it when I first wake up and taking it right before bed so I will change my schedule up when I get down that low. I will say I am a little nervous about the end of my taper, but I plan on taking it slow and one day at a time. 

I have already experienced some benefits to lowering my Kratom usage. My bank account is no longer hemorrhaging money, I’ve lost over 30 pounds (I started doing 48 hour fasts to combat my stomach sickness on day 2, I don’t really need to do it anymore but I like the results so I’ve continued lol), I sleep better and I have more energy. I also feel more preset and in the moment with my family. 

I am finally excited for my future and to get out of this Kratom prison I’ve been in for the past 4 years. I hate having to plan out my day to this junk. I will definitely do another post after I have finally jumped off completely and let you guys know how it’s going! Sorry for the long winded post I just wanted to detail it for myself and for others. Hope everyone is doing well!",10

I'm sleeping at 80% (which feels like 100% comparatively), soreness is *almost* gone, and I'm just in a much better place than I was 2 weeks ago. (You all were totally right, thank you!)

Thing is... I've always considered myself a super *clean* person. My feet never really stunk, my armpits weren't bad (only wore deodorant, never antiperspirant.. never needed to!)... But now.. after 24 hours I smell WEIRD! Not the worst, not like rank B.O., just... weird. I used to shower every other day (sometimes 3 if I didn't sweat day to day.. thanks ice cold office job!), but now, I find myself showering up to 2x day.

Has this happened to anyone else? I'd like to imagine it's just my body flushing out all poison from the last 3+ years. I don't drink, I don't smoke, so hopefully that's it!

Goes without saying that I am not trying to brag or flex, lol.. Just curious.

tl;dr: I stink!

2021-08-09 15:37:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/p18ras/first_real_day_without_kratom_or_opiates/,First real day without Kratom or opiates,"Hello everyone.

I've posted a couple times before, but I'd like to say today is officially my first day without any kratom (or opiates) in quite a while.

As a recap, I was in pain management for about 5 years and was prescribed Fentanyl and oxycodone. After a while, I realized that the medications would seem less effective every couple of months as well as the realization that I'd be on them for the rest of my life. I decided to tell my doctor I wanted to stop and *try* to get off the meds.

The taper lasted about 4-5 months and ended in March. I never really had any crazy WD symptoms except for not being able to sleep (and more emotional than usual). I was awake at one point for 72 hours at the very least.

My biggest concern was that I would feel violently ill, but thank goodness that didn't happen.

Towards the end of my taper process, I found out about Kratom and how it seemed to help with WD symptoms. I headed to a local shop and picked some up just in case. When I didn't have any more pain medicine, I'd take 1 capsule of kratom (.6g)/day for 3 days. And it worked.

I'm not sure if the kratom helped lessen the symptoms or if I had very accute WD symptoms to begin with.

I went a little while without taking them, but noticed it worked great as a pre-workout. I then started taking a .6g capsule before working out, and eventually 2 capsules.

Soon after, as someone who struggles with social anxiety, I was forced into extremely difficult social circumstances for a couple of weeks. During that time I took 4-5 (.6g) capsules on average, and probably 8 capsules as the highest (though very rare).

(And I understand; these doses are very low compared to some, but the mental toll it takes on a person can seem very real. The habit of looking at the clock and realizing it's time to take a capsule can be a real difficult thing to walk away from.)

It eventually became somewhat of a habit. When the clock struck a certain time, I'd be ready to swallow a capsule. Rinse and repeat.

I was primarily using Red Maeng Da, but switched to Green Maeng Da about a month or two afterwards. It gave me a mood, energy and *confidence* boost, but I hated having to rely on it whenever there was something that needed to be done. 

Time to get out of the house? Take a capsule. Time to get a haircut? Take a capsule. Need to do some work around the house? Take a capsule or two. You get the point.

I started lurking in this sub and realized I really need to stop. I'd read posts daily while being frightened of the WD experience. I'd constantly tell myself that I'd ""start tomorrow"" or ""next week"".

Well, ""I'll start tapering tomorrow"" eventually became ""I started tapering yesterday"". From a low dose of between (.6g capsules) 2.4 - 3 GPD, I cut it to 3 .6g capsules daily. Soon after I went to 2 and 3/4 of a capsule and kept pouring out a little more for a few days until it became 2 capsules / day.

I'd take one in the afternoon and one around 7pm(ish). I don't remember exactly when I started taking 2/day. I wish I kept a journal of my ""journey"".

One day after starting 2 cap, I poured half of the K out of each cap. Meaning in the afternoon, I took around .3g and .3g at night.

Day by day I poured out a little more and more until yesterday. I realized that it most likely wasn't affecting me at all and was more so a mental situation going on. So yesterday I had 2 capsules left (plus a full bottle of red and a full bottle of white that need to be thrown away). I grabbed those 2 green caps, opened them up, and poured out the green dust until I could only see a microscopic amount. I knew if I felt anything out of the ordinary, it could possibly be WD (though not expected).

I didn't feel any different than I've felt this past week. I've been *feeling* this past week. Didn't feel great or bad. *Just felt*... 

(As a side note, it does seem like my appetite is increasing a tad bit.)

When I woke up today, I didn't bother going for the Kratom and actually left the house for the first time in a little while. I'm not asking for any ""congrats"" or anything. I don't think I ever really had a legitimate issue with them, but I did realize that the mind is *WAY* stronger than we realize; for better or worse. You are and always will be your own worst enemy.

Edit: TL;DR

I was in pain management, used K to help with potential WD symptoms. Ended up using it longer. Today's my first ""real"" day without K or opiates in a while.",7

2021-08-09 14:44:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/p17nvy/advice_on_my_taper/,Advice on my taper?,"Hello folks. I've been reading here for the past hour and I think it just sunk in for me that while I was not considering it. I think I am in fact in the process of quitting kratom. I wanted to share my story with you all as its hard to find people who can relate to what I've been going through.

Just some quick background. When I was 16 years old I became addicted to percocets, by 18 I was addicted to IV heroin. After 3 of my closest friends died I knew I had to quit. So I bought a gallon of tequila and I threw away what I had and white knuckled it. Never touched the stuff again. I was 22.

From there I was an alcoholic. A hardcore, raging alcoholic. At least one full bottle of liqour a day near the end. That lasted for 8 years. I was about to lose my girlfriend of 17 years, about to be fired from my job, one screw up away from being kicked out on the street with nowhere to go. I knew I had to stop or it would kill me. So I did. I had read somewhere that kratom was a wonder drug that could get you through withdrawals and as far as I could tell not many people destroyed there lives with it so i figured ok, this will be my crutch.

I didnt read at all. And i didnt measure doses. I just did what mad me feel good. Knowing what i know now. My very first dose was around 10gs. And from there it went up. But my relationships repaired, i excelled at work. I finally moved to a nicer apartment with my girlfriend. My life was like night and day. I was so grateful to this wonder drug that had quite literally saved my life.

All the while knowing what was slowly becoming more and more apparent behind all of this.

I could NOT miss a dose. And my dose was BIG. Three times a day 6 heaping teaspoons of maeng da green. you can do the math. I was well over 100gpd. My only explanation to as I was able to not only take that but feel for the most part GOOD while I did. Was where I was coming from. Having done and withdrawn from heroin and then alcohol, this stuff seemed like peanuts.

But I knew how bad it would be when i tried to stop it. If ever decided to. Again my life was smooth sailing and better. But eventually i just realized. This much of ANYTHING is too much. Not to mention the constipation. Its gotta be ripping up my insides i figured. So i began to wean. And i weaned down to 20gs at a time three times a day. It was a battle. but for the most part this wierd nebulous battle. I never quite knew where withdrawals began and just regular life pain ended. I had cut about 40gpd out and i had done it fast. But i was still taking alot so i didnt even really feel that bad i thought.

But now it has been tougher. I cut my 20 gpd 3x a day, to 10 gpd 3x a day. That was even tougher. but still not too too bad... but now im realizing that the continued use of the three doses of 10gs is just affecting me all around. I ALWAYS feel feverish. I ALWAYS have a bit of dizziness. Little things like teeth and minor bumpos hurt that much more.

But im determined to be actually sober. And guys and gals.... I think Im getting there. Next monday Im cutting to 5g doses. I anticipate that being the hardest leg of this journey. If i manage to quit this and stay off of it it will be the first time i am FULLY clean and sober in about 15 years. And so While it is an absolute B\*\*\*\* to quit and can easily ruin a life on its own im sure. I am grateful to kratom in a wierd way. And fully commited to stopping it entirely and never touching it again. Found inspiration on this subreddit to follow through and i wanted to say thank you to you all. And if and when i manag to get off the stuff 100%. I will check back in. Stay frosty people. You can quit anything if you want it bad enough, and no matter where you are, how you feel, or how much youve wasted and burned, everyday will be better if you commit to the idea that it can be.

Edit: I guess i never asked my question, which was simply how bad it would be cutting from 5gs to completely dry. For someone in my situation.

Have always appreciated everyone support, advice, and information here. Well I have been using on and off for 7-8 months or so and 5 months daily with my Gpd ranging from 10-30 ish....I took 6 today and am jumping off the rest of the day...see how I feel tomorrow morning. The morning usually is the most difficult, but hate what abusing this plant does to you emotionally...spiritually...everything. it should only be semi painful the main thing being the mental aspect....but I am gonna dlna rapid taper I mean ...fast. 

I wanna feel again...be inspired..passionate...to cry again...its made my threshold for self control lower and made me extremely unmotivated...its not the only factor of course I have abused a myriad of things but this plant has been a pretty big daily abuser of mine...


Anywho that's my first post and I wish you all the best of luck :) 😃 ❤  let's stay strong and claim our sovereignty back!",4

I understand now why I was numbing myself for so long after the fact. All this stress and emotions came to the surface quicker than I'd have liked. Didn't really hit me until last night, at work right now.

I miss it. I don't know what it is. This might sound silly but I was numb to escape all of this. I miss my ex. I miss feeling important to someone. I haven't met anyone like her after and these emotions are getting to me. I am going to start a gym membership this weekend.

On the bright side my work performance has improved ten fold, I was happy and not feeling down from day 6 til last night. I feel so lost. I need to get back my hobbies. I need to figure out how to deal with the emotions of not having her/it in my life. 

Anyways I'm just kinda ranting at this point. I don't know how to explain it but I feel so unsatisfied with my life. I work then go home and don't do much on my weekends. I'm super proud of myself for getting this far, but part of me wants to escape. I just want to feel like I matter. I know this isn't really kratom related. But has anyone had a similar experience of a break up then using K and getting off and realizing no progress was made in forgetting and forgiving my ex??

Idk I'm 26 and feel like I haven't done shit with my life. I guess it's time to start some hobbies and work out. I hope you all are blessed and taking care of yourself. This is tough but worth it. I want to have a happy life. Being sober hasn't ever been so important to me since this quit. 

My mom is all I have left (dad committed suicide at 15). And I need to stay sober for not just her, but for me, my future, my future partner. Idk. Just a lot rn...

Have a great day everyone you got this!!!! Bless. 🤙",7

It's been over 24 hours this evening will be 2 days CT and I'm feeling the effects of WD as I write this. I deserve this and I'm not making excuses. Kratom which I took for depression and pain has pretty much ruined my life. I had been on it for a few years and was hospitalized about 2 years ago with severe nausea and vomiting lasting 3 days due to the gastric issues it causes. I promised my wife o would quit forever and went CT that very moment in the hospital. I was clean for over a year and started back about 10 months ago not telling her and hiding it. I was recently sick not associated with kratom and she asked me point blank your not talking kratom are you and I cannot lie to her and said yes, which opened up the box of lies and deceitfulness I had been covering up buying it. I'm already severely depressed and now on top of this and the WD I am mentally and physically in hell. I bought some 1000mg vitamin c tablets yesterday on am effort to curb the withdrawals at high doses. I took 7-10 grams 3 times yesterday but it's the ascorbic with rose tips and not the correct sodium ascorbate. Is that better than the one I bought and will it work. If anyone can help me I would please appreciate it. I take effexor XR and Vyvanse which I thought would.help but it's not.

A couple handfuls of years ago I was recovering from an addiction to opiates. The addiction had lasted over six years and carried through numerous life transitions. Well, about six months in I was going through the recovery motions and feeling pretty good about myself. I'd already re-started an exercise routine, found a therapist, and was going to my first doctor visits in years at a holistic clinic aligned with my belief in a mind-body connection. I was on my way.

After a few visits for basic check-ups and labs I was referred to one of the Ayurvedic doctors at the clinic. We talked about the labs and my post-addiction journey and were getting pretty comfortable when she asked me ""On a scale from 1 to 10, how hard are you trying to heal?""

I froze up. She saw through me. This was the first moment I was aware I had been lying, telling myself I was trying to heal at a ""10."" When she asked me that question, I realized that if I was being brutally honest it was really ""a 6 or a 7."" The doctor was a great friend to me that day. By asking me that question she gave me an opportunity to remove the personal story that lived between ""a 6 or a 7"" and ""10."" And that has made all the difference.",27

I clung to my tiny ration of Kratom like a security blanket forever.  I went from over 30 gpd to 2.5 in a month and then got stuck.  I would get so agitated when I didn't have a small dose I couldn't function.  There was always something in my way--sleep, work, deadlines, mother's day, father's day.  

My biggest fear was getting stuck somewhere without a dose and starting to panic.  It happened once when I had car trouble and couldn't get an Uber because of Covid.   Luckily I finally got one but in the short span of time I was sweating.

Now how can this happen with only a daily dose of 2.5 grams split up throughout the day?  I don't fucking know.  Something is wrong with my body chemistry.  I tried to CT at the beginning and after 12 hours I thought I was having a heart attack.   I've been a consistent user for 18 months.  It's part of me.  My body uses it like oxygen.  

So, two points--I did hold at 2.5 for four months so I did show some willpower.  Yes!  I went a little over a couple of times.  Like the long drive through traffic on holidays and the extending time with family and trying not to fidget and sweat.  But this only happened a couple times and I went right back to 2.5.  And even going over 2.5 for one day made the next day miserable.  I have a problem!  

The other point is I don't know what the next few days will throw my way.  I do have two days, Monday and Tuesday, where I can pretty much avoid people and responsibilities.  But it's been 24 hours and I feel out of sorts to say the least.  My body is kind of buzzing and I feel off.  Sleep is not an option--that's okay.  

I really think I can make it but I'm not going to the ER.  I have not thrown out all my Kratom.  I don't want to use it.   I'm not thinking of failure but I am being cautious.  I mean, come on, I can't do this any longer, I understand.  It's like living at gun-point every second of my life.  I'm dependent and it's disappointing. 

I've done it every day for 18 months.  The last four only 2.5 but every day.  It's been in my system non-stop for a year and six months.  That's it!  That's obviously what it is.  The Kratom beginners don't understand how that works but I've lived it.

What's the half-life?  I mean when will my system clear this shit out?  It's not 24 hours, that I can tell you.  

But my journey has begun!  I working on my second 24.  I don't need to sleep and I don't need to go to work today.  Please let this be a really boring day.  

I think, maybe, just maybe, because I lowered my level to 2.5 and maintained it for four months I should be able to avoid most of the hell someone who quite CT or did a fast taper experienced.  It only makes sense.  

I'm not drinking because I blew that recreation out over seven years ago.  I feel I didn't learn the real lesson.  The real lesson was alcohol wasn't the problem.  The problem was my personality and my lifelong habits.  My patterns.  I like to take the easy way out.  I like to escape.  Kratom gave me a path to revisit my unbroken patterns.  It made quick work of me. 

So now I have to learn to live my life without Kratom.  Okay, I get it.  It's my reality.  I'm gonna be depressed and I'm gonna be bored and I'm gonna want to take Kratom again.  Okay, I know the game.  It's the same thing I went through before with alcohol.   I can do it.  I'll get angry and I'll get frustrated but it's what we gotta do.  If not now, when?

Okay!  Going back is not an option.  It only makes it harder.  It sends the wrong signal.  It tells your brain I'd really love to do Kratom but I can't.  Kratom is so wonderful, too bad I can't do it.

It's total bullshit.  It's the kratom talking.  It's fighting me right now like a sob.  That's what it does, psychologically.  It fucks with you.  How will you do this?  How will you do that?  You wont be creative.  You wont be funny.  You wont be yourself.  

I have lost all my friends.  I have not dated.  I'm stuck in my apartment.  I'm going nowhere except deeper into this false Kratom world.  I've been altered.  It's a terrible drug.  It's dangerous.  It's dangerous because it seems safe and it's not.  It cripples you.  It makes you ugly, really ugly.

But I know the drill.  It's like alcohol.  Just get another day.  Just another day.  Just get through today.  Don't project what happens after that.  You are thinking as an addict.  You are thinking as an addict.

So, for those of you who are concerned I have not thrown out my stash, let me tell you I have had alcohol in my house since the day I quit and have never touched it.  If anything it makes me stronger because I can go to 7-11 and buy more,  And now with Kratom it's almost as easy to get more.  Not having it in my apartment won't be the deciding factor.

In AA they tell you before you drink call your sponsor.  That's a joke.  People who make up there mind to drink don't bother.  They just do it.  Same with Kratom at least for me.  If I want to do it I will just do it.  But I will have to live with myself.  And I'll know I run the risk of never quitting and getting sick all over.  It's a big commitment to quit but even a bigger commitment to throw away what's left of your life.

I've been through all the drugs.  I know the drill.  But what I know now that I didn't know back then is it's not the drugs or the alcohol.  It's me!  I'm the problem.  I need to change my patterns.  There's no easy way to get through life.  You gotta work hard and you gotta grow the fuck up.  You have to make sacrifices.  You gotta turn off the TV and get out there and do something.  Build something.  Grow!  Expand!  Keep pushing!

Not all the tim2, I used to have a few day breaks (which were hell), and i succesfully stayed clean for 2-3 weeks in july thanks to microdosing. But when i rqn out of mushrooms the cravings started to creep in. I started again 3 weeks ago. No breaks or anything. I feel really stupid cause we had a 2 weel vacation from work, and if I had just left this shit home when we went on a 10 day holiday, I would be fine by now. I was afraid of withdrawals which wouldve only lasted for like 3 days cause i was on 6gpd. And it would've been easier cause I had time to relax then.
Now I didn't have any kratom today yet. I have no energy and im nauseus. I start working again tomorrow and going CT is out of the question. I have a physically demanding job. How do I taper fast while still being able to work?
Did a little experiment to see if i could workif i only took my doses before work and no. I can not last full 8 hours on 2 gs. I'm desperate.
I can't work with withdrawals. I'm on a ladder most of the time at work and can't withdrawal there.

Quitting has been on my mind for about 5 of the 7 years I have been using Kratom, I want to start by saying, I was addicted to anything that made me feel good. I overdosed on 3 different drugs, 3 different times. The last straw was when I was arrested for possession of scheduled 1. My first arrest. I was faced with probation, as it was my first offense. As long as I didn’t fail a drug test, the charges would go away. That’s where Kratom came in… I had heard about it many times before, but had no reason to try it, because I was too busy with other drugs. But, I knew if I didn’t try something, I would’ve been going to jail after the first test. Knowing Kratom didn’t show on the tests, I started taking it. In the beginning it was a win, win. I felt good and my life was getting better, and I was finally becoming myself again. I made it through a year of probation, and all my charges were dismissed. After this, it was like Kratom was my god. The only thing that got me off drugs, and completely turned my life around. I had been to 5 rehabs, on suboxone, methadone, etc. The only negative I noticed in my first two years of taking it was the constipation, sometimes the worst pain I have ever felt in my stomach. Living off laxatives, because I refused to stop because I was scared of what would happen if I did. Would I go right back to drugs? Will I lose everything I gained? I mean I became the guy I always knew I could be. At this time I was taking 12g at a time / 4 times a day. (Still the same addict, just looked healthier) I was on this insanely high dose for about 4 years. And ever since the second year, I really don’t feel anything good. Maybe nothing at all, it’s basically just my safety blanket. About 3 years ago I started dropping doses big time, because I knew it was a rediculous amount. I went from 12g/4xd to 8g/4xd the first drop. After a year I’d say I went from the 8g 4x a day to 6g 4x a day. The next year I went to 4g 4-5x a day. That brings me to present day and I now take about 1.5G 5x a day. 7 years of ups and downs, and although I’m grateful for what Kratom has brought me, it’s time to stop being scared, and get off. My question is do I need to taper from here? What should I expect from 7 years of doing this. My stomach is tight as I speak but I do have bowel movements daily. So I am concerned of the damage I have caused. Any advice or knowledge would be appreciated. Sorry so long, I wanted to get my story out there, I am happy I found this group.",7

Eventually I thought a dose wouldn’t hurt me and I could handle it. I couldn’t and I had a full blown relapse. I’m so angry with myself because all of my symptoms were amplified once again. Severe dry red eyes, dry skin, dry scalp, severe hair breakage / shedding, stomach aches, and etc. I’m fucking terrified but I’m ready. I don’t want to live my life this way. Continuing to say, “I’ll quit tomorrow.” Has landed me back at square one when I could have already had my life back. I want my beauty back of course but I also want to not be reliant on any substance. When I started kratom I was so naive. I saw it helped with anxiety and tried it out. Had NO clue it was highly addictive and could be abused. I have two days off in a row so I’m hoping I can get through the shitty physical WD. The reason I’m so scared to quit is because of the RLS / insomnia that I had the first time. I’m so worried about the lack of sleep that I’m losing sleep before I even attempted the quit lol. Anyways, I’m ready for a new life. Kratom was good when it was good but it’s literally ruining my life at this point. I’m not trying to demonize it this is just my personal experience. I think it has really messed up my hormones. It’s just not worth it anymore. Also anyone who says it does not cause hair loss is a straight up liar. I’m suffering with scalp loss, eyebrow loss, and eyelash loss. It all correlates to my kratom use.",4

I’m currently tapering and have gotten myself down to around 40ish gpd from where I was. Just earlier today I was really congratulating myself but seeing written out, I’m a little less proud. I work long hours and it gets really difficult. I start to really fear that bored feeling. I feel like I’ve damaged myself in ways that can never be fixed. The hair loss, weight loss, intestinal issues…among some other really bad stuff, it feels like it’s all building up around me. I don’t really know what the purpose of this was, I’ve just never put this into words and have never been able to communicate these issues with anyone in my life and it’s starting to get lonely.

I remember from previous quits this being such a frustrating part of recovery. You think after acutes, or maybe 10 days, you'll be all fine and dandy but NOPE. My mental state is pretty good, I'd say. It's just all these residual physical feelings that are OH SO FRUSTRATING. Ugh. I have all the supplements - magnesium, l theanine, ashwagandha, vit C, valerian root. Not much seems to touch it. It's hard to find something to be interested in as well. Can't properly lose myself in videos and stuff. While I'm at work, I'm more or less fine. It's always after work, though.

I know I'm getting better, it's just sooooo gradual. I should hopefully only have to deal with this for another week, week and a half. And even though I'm complaining, I'd still happily take this over acutes!!

Anyway, just had to get the frustrations out of me. Thanks for listening. Just gonna take it day by day still :)",16

 So I decided f\*ck it, I am getting off of this. My dad died recently and July 31st was his birthday so I am also doing this to honor him, but  this has to be done for me only in the end.

 So I felt okay until this weekend. I felt like acute withdrawal was back, felt feverish, achy, sniffles, and weird dreams. I was so weak and tired I was stuck in bed all weekend. I never slept much but when I did I had these weird fever dreams. Like I couldn't get out of bed until I solved this puzzle with five pieces and then I would snap back to reality, and then go back into that weird dream mode.

 Does this sound normal at this stage? I have been taking kratom for around four years because I don't take any other meds, but I just want everything out of my system. I jumped off at 4-6GPD and I got there via a fairly controlled taper over a period of a month of I have no idea how much I was taking. Like 7 or 8 large teaspoons a day. So I stayed loyal to my scale and got myself down to a low enough dose that I could ""easily"" jump off at.

 Anyone with similar experiences at a week or more into their quit?",19

First of all, thank you all for the courage you gave me to quit that god forsaken powder. In addition to this forum, What helped me finally make the leap was telling my girlfriend about my use. Naming the addiction took it out from the darkness and turned it into something to address. 

After using around 10gpd i am now completely off kratom for the first time in 4 years. My god it is hard: chills, body aches, frustration, and mostly extreme exhaustion. 

Are there any supplements, tips or tricks that have helped any of you with this? I'm working a pretty physically demanding job and the exhaustion is getting really annoying. Or will this feeling pass? How long will it take?

I tapered down to 10gpd in the first 3 days. I didn’t have a ton of Kratom left when I started this taper, and I planned on tapering a little more rapidly. Now I’m on day 9, with only enough Kratom for another 10gpd tomorrow. 

I’m not sure what to do. I feel like the slower taper has been working well for me, but I’m also loathe to go buy more to keep this up. I fear if I jump to CT too soon I’ll sabotage my chances. But I worry that if I buy more, the lack of scarcity (the closest Kratom store to me is an hour away so having had less on me has helped me want to stretch it out) will also sabotage my chances. I’m just nervous to make any sudden movements as this is farthest I’ve gotten and the most hopeful I’ve felt about it.

Update for my own accountability,"So I updated as I was approaching 24 hours, then again at 4 days, and now just hitting the 9 day mark.   In short, I was in pain management for close to 3 years and began abusing my meds about 2.5 yrs in.   By the time I quit my pain meds, I was taking close to my entire month script of 4 15 mg oxy’s per day in roughly 10 days.   I was no longer getting any therapeutic affect or high from the pills, I was just chasing what I considered a feeling of wellness… free of my normal crippling anxiety.   I finally just quit the meds and switched over entirely to Kratom.   In some ways Kratom was a lesser evil, because I was able to engage at home and work in a fairly normal way, but after a year of using Kratom, I realized I let go of one addiction to just pick up another.   

On July 30th I quit, following a rapid 1 week taper from 30 GPD to 1 GPD.   I still am dealing with some acute wd, including bad RLS (mainly in my arms) and fatigue, but for the most part things are improving!  I entered an outpatient partial hospitalization program three weeks ago, and I have finally learned some healthy coping skills to deal with my anxiety (the real reason I went down the rabbit hole to begin with).  Helper meds have been a godsend, but it’s really the inner strength I have found from 3 weeks of intense therapy that has carried me through.

Hoping the acutes pass soon… I am preparing for PAWS, by putting a strategy in place to deal with whatever might come.


Sorry for the long, rambling post… putting things in writing makes me feel more accountable.   If you just jumped or haven’t, but desperately want to, I am here to say there is hope and a path forward!!!  Regardless if you’re going through a taper or CT, the final step to leave the substance behind can only be taken by you!   Buckle up, prepare to be okay with not fucking being okay, and finally just SURRENDER.   You are stronger than you fucking realize.   

If you need someone to share with… shoot me a PM.  ❤️❤️❤️

TL;DR:  Holy fuck, I am 9 days sober after 3 years without making it even one day off this shit.",11

I'm going to go a few days without it before I start taking naltrexone. I'm getting some meds to help me through the detox and withdrawals. I'm getting gabapentin and promethazine. I'm still trying to also get a prescription for clonodine. I've read a lot of everyone else's posts here and it seems like those made a world of difference to people during withdrawals.

I've been using every day for 5 years straight. Getting clean is going to be hard. I start getting sick if I don't have any after even just a few hours, so I am worried that going days is going to be insanely difficult.

With that said, I'm looking for any tips anybody has that may help me be a little more comfortable through this and ultimately more successful. 

My wife bought me some bath salts, because I know I'm going to be very sore and achy, so I'll be spending a lot of time in a hot bath.  I have a heating pad and icepacks ready for the hot flashes and chills. She also bought me some new comfy sweats, pajamas, and hoodies. She is wondering what else she can get me to help out, and I'm not sure, so any suggestions are appreciated.

I am going to be very sleepy and will need lots of rest, but in other attempts to sober up, I haven't been able to sleep because of pain, rls, and anxiety.

I have also gotten very sore and achy and fatigued. 

When I quit taking it, I get very down and depressed and feel terribly hopeless and helpless.

These are the big things I've struggled with before and am concerned about, so any tips to help with those things will be very valuable, but I'm also interested in anything else you know of that may help with any other part of withdrawals.

What worked for you?

What do you wish you knew before you started detoxing?

I used for 2.5 years. During the first 5 months it was 2g like 2-3x a week. The tolerance built up. Then started using every day. Tried to quit a few times but relapsed after about 1 month.

So far, the progress has been:

Less anger!

Way less Anxiety!

Dopamin/Focus.

Digestive issues cleared up.

Looking Healthier!

Improved relationships!

The depression swooped in and there was nothing I could do to get the shit thoughts out of my head. It got to the point where just ending it all was the only somewhat peaceful thought I could think. I think I went into self preservation mode at that point.

So Friday night I took 4g, followed by another 3g a couple hours later. I slept for maybe an hour and a half, and took another 4g yesterday to make it through a family function. Hating myself for it the whole time. 

So today is day 1 again… woke up feeling pretty terrible. Trying to get my body in motion to not slip all the way back. I had been making such good progress. The anxiety is almost unbearable today. 

Idk. It really sucks, and I’m not sure just how negatively it’s gonna impact the progress I’ve made, but I have no desire to continue taking it because I know where it leads.

My peak was when I was using about 10 grams a day.   
Over the last month I've brought it down to 20 to 30 grams per week.  
I still feel this isn't right, and I want to quit completely.   
I need to remind myself that days without Kratom aren't that bad, if I just need to be more creative with how  I fill my days.  


So, I have noticed an extremely strange thing some days when I was on Kratom, and it's another very good reason to quit completely.  
When I would use even just slightly more than what I needed, about 3/4 grams over a couple of hours, my emotions and thoughts would be hard to regulate. I would worry about how I made others around me feel and have paranoid thoughts. I would worry about small remarks I got, and it would get into my mind badly, so far that it ruined my mood. My thoughts felt very feverish. I am 100% sure this is because of the Kratom, because while I experience fog and emotional spikes, this was very different. I have some underlying issues, like mood swings and a psychotic sensitivity. Have any of you experienced this?  


It really was a horrible side effect and one more reason to just quit it.

   Like others here, either still looking for their way or have gotten it done and over with, I have finally found my way to quitting. Most of you won't like it, I didn't really myself. But there is a reason exercise keeps coming up in these posts. It really worked for me. Ive tried quitting so many times and always came back after 2 to 3 weeks due to lack of energy. Before I stopped completely, cold turkey, I just started running. Wake up at 430am(it was brutal getting out of bed), get dressed and run. Then id take my dose. Go to work(more like survive the workday), come home and run. Just as far as i could(which wasnt far at all at first). Then take my dose. Did this for a week. Took my last dose on a sunday morning. Soon as the withdrawals started(about 7 hrs before it got shitty) i went for a run. Guys(and gals), it sounds worse than it is. Literally the hardest part is getting your shoes on and walking out the door. Just freaking do it. Every chance you get just do something that'll make you sweat that shit out of you. You feel soooooo much better(it still sucks), but the restless legs were replaced with sore as hell legs(and i loved that, i felt accomplished). Insomnia? Yes, still happened.. but nowhere near as intense. I was physically exhausting myself. My body(and mind) desired the rest. And i rested well for the most part. Train like you're preparing to beat team Kenya in a marathon. Your body will have so much shit going on that the withdrawals will feel like a faint shadow always near you instead of the overtaking gloomy darkness that you're used to feeling. If you're unable to run, bike. Treadmill. Calisthenics. But get your heart going, and sweat pouring. Im at 20 days now(ive been here before and PAWs always made me start using again), but 20 days and the lingering effects are minimal. I HAVE ENERGY. That was the worst part for me. I can deal with pain, but lack of motivation crippled me. No longer an issue. Just FREAKING do it. I will say again. THE HARDEST PART IS WALKING OUT THE DOOR. Break through that voice telling you to wait until later. You feel so ALIVE once you get your heart rate up. If you're reading this right now and don't have shit to do today because kratom has made you so unmotivated and uninterested in ANYTHING, then put this damn phone down(unless you need it for  POSITIVEmusic🥰), put on that epic workout outfit that makes you feel fine as hell, and walk out of the damn door(bring a water bottle, it hurts at first). Do it for you, do it for me, and everyone else here that continues to struggle everyday. 

Last thing.. sometimes after my run id go inside to rest, and bam! Withdrawals started kicking my ass. Guess what i did? Went right back outside as soon as i could catch my breath. You and your body are ALOT more capable than you'd ever believe! Get yo ass up!

This is my first time using this app and i have no idea how it works. But if you're ever struggling and need someone to talk to. Send me a message or however it works on here. I'll give you my phone number if needed. Hit me up. We can help each other. Im sure i'll still be struggling for days to come as well. Love you all.",17

So to preface I was taking around 7-8 gpd for 2 years, sometimes less, sometimes a little more but usually around that.  I also did go in month stints where I would take extract tinctures everyday.  


I am currently at 31 days off from going CT and feel pretty much back to normal after some pretty bad acutes for about 6 days after CT.  I have quit before and it was easier the other time but even last time I never experienced PAWS nor am I now.

I was kratom free for 8 months from a 3 year 30+gpd habit and then i decided to take kratom once and ended up taking 30gpd everyday for a month. The withdrawals have not been nearly as bad as last time, but the cravings are alot worse because it actually felt kinda good again.

But i can't waste my life watching tv shows and YouTube videos. Even when i was off kratom i was drinking heavily and isolating almost every night, and when i quit drinking within a week i was back on kratom. Now I've been kratom and alcohol free for these days, And I'm feeling lots of emotions of nostalgia to my life before i started doing drugs and was happy, as well as to times i did drugs and actually had a good time. I feel disappointed for wasting so much time, and i know i have to stop now if i wanna make something out of myself while I'm still young because if i don't stop I'm just gonna keep falling back into the cycle of telling myself I'm quitting tommmorow everyday for years. I have been smoking myself silly during wds to get sleep and avoid mental breakdowns, but I'm ready to take a nice break from grass again too.

I have finally got my life back together after kratom ruined it once, i can't let it do it again. When i first quit i started picking my old hobbies back up but once i started drinking a 6 pack of tall boys every night and was working that was over. I want to use my free time doing stuff i like and being social, not hiding from the world getting high by myself talking to my internet friends and hanging out w my hs friends every once in a while. This is not how my future will look like. 

Altho i have been feeling okay today, i was driving around to kill time and just kept daydreaming about getting high again.

Stay strong ❤️ choose life",10

Need encouragement. 🙏🏻","I’m not going back but I needed to post here for some help and empathy from y’all. I’m at 22 days CT and never thought I would be. I tried to quit months ago but went back after a week of misery thinking I could never level out mentally. By now, most of the acutes have passed but the RLS and body aches are still very present. Everything still hurts. Even my jaw (I have TMJ which K seemed to help numb out) has these twinges of pain when I first eat everyday. My knees, ankles and feet tingle, burn, and ache. Body temp stuff has improved a ton although I still have moments of fluctuation. Hang in there if you’re in the first two weeks as this was one of my worst symptoms.
A big hurdle in my quit so far is a few days in I had knee surgery and I still can’t walk. So, all the exercise and walking advice I haven’t been able to practice. I’m probably still weeks away from walking without pain, so much of my recovery has been laying low and resting through it.
The reason I’m posting today is because I just feel utterly empty and blank; all day, every day. I have zero life behind my eyes. My partner asks me things and I just have no answers. “I don’t know”. No energy. I feel useless. Blank. 
For context, I used K daily for 2.5 yrs in heavy amounts. I never measured. I would classify myself as a heavy user bc I would often just take more.
Will I get out of this mental fog? I hated how K made me feel like a zombie but having zero energy and still feeling like a zombie is kicking my ass. Just feeling so discouraged mentally and emotionally speaking. Thank you all for posting your success stories. It helps tremendously.",18

I‘m currently on day 12 of my healing process (CT / 30+GPD).
It’s actually my second time trying to quit K … this time I really have to get it done!
Well I’m doing okay so far - just insomnia is still really present and also some restless symptoms at night.
Those WD are suspected to last at least 3 more weeks if I do remember right from last time.
What’s new - I do have several sweat attacks a night - I can’t do anything against them - do you have some tips for that? How long did they last for you?
Also i still do have some physical withdrawals left this time. Last time they didn’t last for so long.
I really have to work through the whole day - it’s really exhausting. It’s manageable (doing around 10km of walking a day at work) but soooo exhausting. Do you remember when you’ve been back to full power?
Also i do still notice quit strong those fevery symptoms at night. My bones hurt, I feel cold and sick and just standing up from sofa is a challenge.

Really this time quitting the peak was way more manageable than last time - but my physical withdrawals do last a lot longer… I hope I’m back to normal soon.
Everyone out there - stay strong and heal your body and soul 👍

All in all I’m feeling proud for this big step - and I’m happy I did it.
But my brain is still missing the K in a strange way… but I’m in control !!! No more green ugly sludge!",3

2021-08-07 13:57:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/ozy0or/1_month_without_kratom/,1 month without Kratom,"Hi,

been reading the sub for quite a while now and decided to write my first report after a month of absinence from Kratom. I've been using Kratom for four years, since I had a surgery. of course I developed a dependency after like two months. classical symptoms of opioid withdrawal - I guess most ppl. in this sub know what I'm talking about. 

As I got promoted pretty decently to a global position within my company I had to get off, the intake intervalls got very frequent during the pandemic-caused home office. it got really outta hand. even while taking i felt awful honestly. over a month ago I contacted a doc specialized in substitution. He had to read into it as he was unfamiliar with the substance, but it also triggered his professional interest. I visited him and we spoke about the general stuff and the substance and my subjective abuse of it. 

He had quite some troubles, as there is no secure equivalence to other opiates/opioids. generally those docs have a table where they can look up how much g.e. mor. is how much oxy and so on... therefore tapering is not that easy with kratom and only possible with a constant percentage of mytraginin. with a natural product it's not undoable but very unreliable with varying batches. further information: i am from Europe - extracts or shots are not existent here, as I think they are in the US. 

therefore we agreed upon a try with dhc and pregabalin. Here we began with 2*120... then as followed: 2*90, 2*60 and from tomorrow on I will take 2*45. so far it went well, I also had the first two weeks off, so that definitely helped. pregabalin is dosed to max of 100mg per day, on my own advise I can lower the dose to 75mg per day, which was almost every day. 

Is it great? yes! I broke out of a cycle and was able to work again a full day without having to go home to consume during lunch. that sounds like nothing but is really a success after so much hide and seek with colleagues. 

DHC itself is very dangerous and where I live even regulated as a hard opioid if the dose is over 100mg. Honestly I don't feel anything from them, maybe because they're SR. the dose now is pretty low and the symptoms are getting worse, for now it's mostly the diarrhia, which is annoying. further the sweating sucks as well. of high importance is to be active and outside. I also take some vitamines and magnesium. guess that helps the body, but the phsychological part remains. 

Also important was to get rid of the kratom from atleast visual sight and destroy stuff that remembers you of it consumption glass - we all had our favourite, I guess. also the sites from my browser had to be deleted.

I'm really motivated to pull it through. stay up my friends... you can make it.",6

I had a 1.5 year 20gpd addiction to Kratom. I’m 36 now. Wife and two kids. I’ve been diagnosed in the past with depression, anxiety, ptsd… meds have never helped me. I had an adderall addiction in my 20s that lasted about 3 years. It was prescribed by a doctor but I would take my month supply in the first 2 weeks. Quit that horrible substance cold turkey and never looked back. It was easy to quit because my script ran out and I didn’t refill it. It’s nice when it can’t be bought at the corner store. 

I’ve always struggled with feeling happiness or joy. Therefore I’ve always searched for substances to fill the void (alcohol , weed, nicotine). In February 2020, I started experimenting with kratom. Taking 2-3 gdp quickly turned into 20. 

I love kratom. It makes me more outgoing, more social , more patient with my kids, and I get joy out of daily activities. I also work midnights and kratom helped tremendously with staying focused and awake at night. I decided to quit kratom for one reason: over the year, I started having significant ED with my wife. I’ve never had that problem before. I also totally lost my sex drive. I’m on TRT and get my blood checked annually. So I know it’s not hormone related. I started researching kratom side effects and learned about how it mimics opioids and can cause sexual dysfunction. My sex life with my wife is more important than feeling good while taking kratom. 

I guess I’m just saying, this sucks and is gonna be hard to stay away from since I didn’t experience any real negative side effects other than ED. I’m currently withdrawing just like everyone else on here has described. 

Anyone experience similar ED side effects from kratom? Once you quit, how long did it take to regain normal function?

Im not recommending Quiting cold turkey but here’s where I’m at:

Reasons I quit:
1) my motivation has been terrible for a long time now. Emotions have been dull. It’s like I was just “whatever” about anything going on in life whether good or bad. I was never like that before Kratom

2) spending way too much money- I’m so sick of that

Why I didn’t taper:

I tried tapering but first day of tapering down even a minor amount- I was already feeling withdrawals so I figured if I’m going to feel withdrawals during taper then I’m just going to rip the bandaid off and jump- get this over with as quick as possible

Helper meds: None

You will feel withdrawals but for me they have not been near as bad I have expected after reading these horror stories

Worst part of withdrawals for me so far:

RLS and insomnia


Taking time off work: I didn’t 

I have worked every day- not easy but quite honestly I think it’s been the best thing to distract me from withdrawals. I quit on a Sunday and work monday through Friday 40 hours/week. It hasn’t been easy, though. I am on my feet all day at work.

Here’s what I have to say:

When you are staring at the ceiling all night restless as hell just know these demons are hurting worse than you are. They are loosing their grasp on you and clawing with all they have because they know you are stronger than you think and they are so so so scared you will push through this and they are doing their final last push to torture you to the point of re-dosing and relapsing to get you back on their band wagon which leads to hopelessness- they get off on this.

Grit your teeth and push through. Put your feelings aside and tough it out- it gets better quicker than you think

Sleep improved significantly on day 5 and so did RLS. The most difficult withdrawals have already dissipated. I am so thankful that I did this. I was scared for so long.

Push through my friends- get your life back on track. I’ll post an update in a week.",98

I first want to thank this forum… I’m active duty Air Force and have been using kratom for 4 years now.  Honestly?  It helped me quit drinking but at this point it’s gotten a little out of control.  I developed a 20-30g habit a day.  I was selected for a commissioning opportunity and being in this new role has made me realize the negatives with being hooked on this crap.  I’m not nearly as sharp when I’m on this.  I become scatter brained, I feel dull and at this point I’m literally taking this to feel normal.  The euphoria is almost non existent now.  But I found out I’ll be going to Officer Training soon!  Holy shit its time to clean up!  I posted on here a couple weeks ago in desperate need of help.  Y’all came thru for me in a big way!  In less than two weeks I’ve gone from 25-30g a day to 4g now… It was rough but I think my body has adapted somewhat.  I still feel really rough tapering… 

My goal?  Taper down to 2g tomorrow and then cold turkey Monday on… I put in for leave Monday thru Friday.  I’m scared.  What if I cant do it?  I felt so shitty going 12 hours without any kratom.  I’m going to do this.  I have to.  No way I’ll make it thru officer training going thru these types of withdrawals.  Im sure I’m giving a shining example of our military but its true with me.  I’m going to do this.  I have a weeks worth of tv shows lined up.  Just gonna hunker down with my dog and get thru it all.

Thank you to everyone who was kind enough to give me a plan and pms.  I hope I’m able to fully get thru.  See you all on the other side!",27

One thing i see very often is that the main symptom of phenibut paws is emotional anhedonia (no joy in life) but i actually dont have any of it and i am even more emotional than before.

So i asked myself if my Paws that im dealing with are Kratom related? I only used it for around 2 months and 5x a week 3-5g. My symptoms are more anxiety, melancholia, depression and ecessive sweating sometimes and a weird feeling in the stomach especially in the morning. I also remembered on one bad night that I desperately wanted to order kratom but didn’t and Made silly excuses why. When i now think about taking kratom i have a great feeling but when i think about phenibut i would Never want to take it again. So maybe these paws Are much More kratom related than phenibut. I also reacted extremely good to kratom and loved it. Is it possible to have these symptoms (anxiety, depression, unsatisfying feeling, social anxiety...) after only this short time of taking kratom?

Well, I relapsed, but I caught myself. If you read my post history, I originally had a online vendor PL habit of 15-20 GPD constantly for 6 months.

Getting off of that was hell. I jumped in, I wanna say, February? Physical symptoms for a week, and then it took me about a month and a half to get right mentally. I also did MDMA during that period which did NOT help.

So from March - Late May I was K free, and after I got over the month and a half of hell, I was okay all things considered. My anxiety and depression weren't prevalent.

But I came back in late May and started slugging SS' liquid extract. People who have done it know. It's STRONG.

I did it for four weeks (about 1-1.5 ml a day, one dose) before I woke up and realized I was going to go broke and ruin everything. Early June I pulled the plug.

This was strange. I seem to remember the physical acutes only lasting maybe 3 days, tops. 7-10 days out, I even mentally felt better. I went out on a date and could talk and do well. I could even drink after that period. I was good. I got lucky.. really lucky. Some people do these extracts for longer than that and suffer.

Well life happened again and on July 6th I got back on. I picked myself up again and realized oh fuck this is bad. I was up to 3 ml a day (one dose) and feeling WDs around 24 hours after my last dose. This didn't happen with my previous stint, probably because my dose wasn't astronomical unlike this go around.

I noticed this was the case for a week or two, so I took my last dose August 4th. Today is August 6th.

I took off work today (Friday) and monday, rented a place, and pledged to detox myself alone over the weekend. I tried Vitamin C, BSO, Magnesium, Kava etc. But none of that shit helped.

It's been 48 hours since my last dose. Yesterday was hell. 1 hour of sleep total. This morning was rough, too. Took a shower around 12 in the afternoon and headed to my detox area.

Curiously right now I feel physically pretty okay. I even dozed off involuntarily two times so far today - granted, a half hour, and an hour respectively, but I dozed off.

I'm sitting here wondering if I got lucky, again. I don't want to jinx it, but I might be through the woods physically.

My issue is that I'm alone in this rented foreign place and the mental aspect is kicking in tough. Restless anxiety. I wanna move, but have nowhere to go. 

I was wondering if anyone else got off easy, or do you think Day 3 and 4 will kick my ass? They didn't last time. I caught myself early, again, but my dosage basically doubled over this period. Any extract users, even if it's not SS', I'd really appreciate your input.

Guess I just wanted to rant and look for support since I'm alone in this quiet place and nothing really is occupying my mind.

Thanks a lot.",1

On average, I have at least one quit attempt per week. I typically push through the weekend and then show up to my local headshop bright and early on Monday morning.

Like many of you, I’m just so tired of this being a part of my life.

I could go on for hours about how much this stuff takes from m.

These last few weeks I havent even been getting my 2 days a week in. 

All of these attempts are wearing me down mentally. I’m starting to feel like using everyday/not trying to quit would at least allow me to stay consistent. This back and forth with myself is maddening.

However, I know the only true path to peace is through the fire.

I’m trying again starting tomorrow. Going CT as I am incapable of maintaining a taper. (Plus I’m ready to get this over with)

I’ll be fine on Saturday/Sunday (albeit in WD)as the two day a week thing is normal for me.

Monday morning is going to be my first “true” test.

Can’t seem to get anything done. It’s been hard to take care of myself. I have to work twice as hard to get schoolwork and other obligations done. I was wondering if anyone saw a psychiatrist during PAWS and they were able to help with certain medications? Rn I’m on 10 mg of Prozac a day and 40 mg of diazepam (which I want to wean off of soon). Anyway I was wondering if anyone saw a psychiatrist that prescribed them meds to deal with the severe depression? And what helped you? I know time is healing but I’m struggling. I’m not going back - this I can promise you so I have to suffer daily and it’s just not that fun. LOL. Sorry I just use comedy to cope. Anyways did your psychiatrist put you on any meds to aid during PAWS when you’re severally depressed and unable to focus/concentrate on anything? Lmk what you took. I’m excited because day 40 will be in two days but I’m just depressed all the time which is no good especially when I have a huge semester coming up. I might switch around my course load. Or drop a class but that’ll mean next semester I’ll have to take a lot of classes to graduate sooo I’m kinda worried!,2

I managed to drop *rapidly* from >30gpd to around 2.5gpd, maybe even 2gpd for a few days. But I hit a wall right there. I just couldn't seem to get below that level. I spent a couple weeks going up and down a bit - bad days I took a bit more, good days it felt like the end was in sight, but then I'd get up in the night and dose just to get a few hours of sleep. I feel defeated and ashamed, and it seems *ridiculous* that I can't get off this stuff when I'm at such a tiny dose.

Anyhow, two days ago I managed to go 16 hours - all night and much of the day - without dosing. I took some in the afternoon, then a bit more at bed time. Total of 1.5g all day. Then yesterday I managed 17 hours without dosing, then I took a half gram in the afternoon and a half gram before bed. Just one gram total in 24 hours. Slept through and feel ok now. I want to take some kratom but I don't *need* to, which is a different thing.

So I need some encouragement for this home stretch! One gram probably sounds like nothing at all to most of you. Just jump, right? But to me 1g feels as essential to my day as 30g felt a month ago. The mind is weird thing. And it is 99% my mind at this point.

I haven’t slept more than 3 hours on each of these nights. I was doing really well there, with sleep the past few weeks. Then PAWS came along and punched me in the face.

I wake each morning in an immediate panic, and so I’ve begun scheduling my daily runs for the AM, instead of at night like I used to do. Running takes away all of my anxiety. I don’t know what I’d be doing without it.  

I remember my first 2 weeks, I couldn’t even walk let alone run. I’ve come so far since then. 

Last but not least is the ever-present brain fog. It lifts slowly each day, but not enough to detect it. It’s only after I look back to the beginning that I can see how far I’ve come. But I have SO MUCH further to go.

I’m excited to see what this month brings, in the way of healing. I’m sure PAWS has yet to show me all her nasty tricks, so I’ll keep an eye on that.

2021-08-06 11:30:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/oz8z9q/quitting_update/,Quitting update,"Hi all - I last posted in September of 2020 as I was quitting an around \~20 gpd kratom addiction.  I went through recovery via help from Suboxone (ultimately recommended, but more to come on that topic).  After nearly 11 months of clean time, I relapsed earlier this week.  Luckily, I was still involved in recovery meetings and came clean a day later, both to my group, and to my wife, and I'm now back on track, at least for today.

While I recommend to those early in recovery to use Suboxone if cravings and withdrawal are a concern, my experience in coming off the suboxone has been an overwhelming wave of cravings that, ultimately, I succumbed to earlier this week.  The suboxone worked wonders for eliminating cravings and I did not experience any withdrawal until I tapered off of it.  If in the same situation as I was 11 months ago again, I'd use suboxone again.  

Even though the last 48 hours has been an extremely frustrating time and I've been very down on myself, I also understand that relapse is a big part of recovery, and it's vital that we learn from relapse rather than be defeated by it.  For anyone else in a similar place, you can do this!  

I'm hoping to get feedback from the sub from others who've been in my shoes, experiencing daily, sometimes intense cravings, months after quitting.  I haven't felt like myself in months.  I feel tired on a daily basis, a lack of motivation, and my brain is constantly sending signals that say ""you know what would make you feel better immediately?  kratom.""  Sometimes I feel like the days will never end, and at the same time it's impossible for me to imagine staying sober for the entirety of the rest of my life.   
 This sort of mental jujitsu isn't healthy, I know.  How do folks deal with that in the long term?  When do the cravings begin to subside and when did you start to feel normal again?  Thanks in advance for the feedback - I've been an opiate addict for nearly two decades now, but kratom has been the most difficult substance to quit, simply because of its accessibility.  Any pointers or advice are welcome.",1

Things are good! I have gone on several trips this year and have saved approximately 7 hours of my life not having to prepare kratom capsules for travel, sneak away & take them. The improvement to the quality of my life in not having to plan/prepare/sneak away/deal with WDs in between doses/etc is immeasurable

Everyone on here trying to quit - you CAN do this. Maintain determination & remind yourself regularly why you want to. Don’t bite off more than you can chew, don’t convince yourself that the negative aspects during quitting are permanent or your “new normal”. Take one step at a time (whether it be a leap, a baby step, an inch crawl) towards your end goal and be proud of yourself every minute/hour/day of your progress forward. Staying at a lower level than where you started for a day/week/month is still forward progress in my book and you are slowly stepping away from this habit that leeches the life out of us.

For 5+ years I thought kratom was just going to forever be a part of my life. Beyond to have broken through that way of thinking.

Odd observation that I want to throw out in case anyone scrubs this thread for this topic - I’ve posted a few times about how my lymphnodes were swollen (specifically in my neck). Swollen for over a year and could have been more than 2 (I didn’t start panicking about it until more recently but had visited the doctors more than once over the years to get everything checked out). Four months after quitting they went down to their normal size. It could have absolutely been due to something I’ll never know, but the facts are that they were swollen (noticeably so; if I looked up you could see them) for at least a year while constantly using. Went down 4 months after quitting and have been down ever since. I always suspected it could be something to do with my hormones & for now that’s still my best guess. 

This sub gave me the motivation & shoulder to lean on to finally be able to make this post. Last year I made the goal of wanting to be able to throw a post out there with a “1 month”, “2 month”, “6 month”, “1 year” title. And I will continue moving that goal post down the road.

I know .3 doses may seem small but with less being more I still feel each dose.

First was back in November when I cold turkeyed around 80 gpd. I pushed thru it and made it 17 days before I relapsed. I was lucky enough to have the first 7 days off work so I basically just holes up in my room for the acutes. Second time was around 2 months ago and I ended up going to a detox center at around 150 gpd. They put me on Suboxone for 6 days, 3 days at 8 mgs then 3 at 4 then nothing. Pulling me off of Suboxone at such a high dose did very little to help my withdrawal and I ended up relapsing about 24 hours later. I've never been more ashamed of my actions until then. Now a few months later I've been playing around with tianeptine which has risen my tolerance thru the roof. I can't get any effect from Kratom now and have basically been stuck in minor withdrawals for the last few weeks. I'm broke till I get paid in 2 weeks and have very little Kratom so I'm going to do a rapid taper. I have around 20 grams of agmatine along with half a d8 cart and half of a bootleg thc cart. This time I can't take anytime off work and I'm going to have to tough it out. I'm a chef at a busy restaurant and I. Worried that the combined stress may make me lose my iob. I'm terrified at how bad this may be this time around but I really have no choice. If anyone has any advice on a rapid taper that would be much appreciated. I really hope I can stay off it this time. I'm tired and broken and just want to end this misery.",5

Got f’d up for a month. The kratom helped immensely for getting off the month long daily fent escapade. But two months later I’m tapered down to using literally 2 gpd, usually in the middle of the night because of this ANNOYING RLS INSOMNIA. cant sleep AT ALL and just have to kick my legs unless I take the gram or two. How close am I to tapering this off or do I just need to go CT at this point instead of taking 1.5 - 2 g’s every night to curb rls symptoms. Thanks y’all",3

I have many times and I always hated it. I hated it because I didn’t want to always be an addict . People can change it is a bullshit saying I would tell myself.

Yet there I was; An addict. For 15 years addicted to opiates. There were brief period of sobriety but sure enough I would slip up and be back following my addictive tendencies. 

Once an addict always an addict would pop up in my mind. Is it truth? I’m suffering I know I don’t want to do this anymore it’s destroying everything but with that burning desire and knowledge I would use and use and use and use. 

I’m grateful to say that I have stepped out of that cycle and am celebrating another day alive over a week off of Kratom and really making it through some intense stuff with my eyes and heart open.

Oh yeah and lots of spiritual insight the whole purpose for this post was an answer to that question id been asking myself all those years of self reflection on addiction.

Is once an addict always an addict true?

The answer came in a quote from Carl Jung I read the other day. 

He said ,”Our problems do not go away but we are able to outgrow them.”

So yeah it kinda true because the “addict” is still in there but it’s not really true because I didn’t use today and I’ve grown to a place where I no longer have to suffer as an addict. 

I’ve outgrown the selfishness and have turned to selflessness. I’ve outgrown the suffering and turned to healing.

They are all the same yet experienced oppositely.

Spiritual insight galore it’s good shit body feeling better

Hang in there y’all we r growing immensely",12

It's been a tough week, but overall the withdrawals haven't been nearly as intense compared to when I quit CT. 

I'm just feeling super drained. My mood hasn't been great. I went on a 45 minute walk last night and my joints got really achey halfway through. It's going to take a lot more than that to make me cave though. If this is as bad as things get, I'm in the clear. 

I have a feeling I'm standing at the precipice of the dark void that is PAWS though. It's always made me insanely depressed. But I'm ready to dive in this time. I have to do this. No matter how bad it gets, I'm going to hang on until I feel better mentally. Best of luck to all of us. We can do this.",7

Thyroids seemed good, so did kidneys! I take an everyday supplement for multivitamins but I’m probably going to get a vitamin D supplement because that was extremely low and that can increase depression. Anyway… luckily Kratom didn’t inflame my kidneys, I will keep persevering but I’m sad because my new psychiatrist won’t contact me back so now I’m left without a psychiatrist and running low on valium. Not good. Anhenodia is through the roof which is to be expected as I had anhenodia prior to Kratom, I took Kratom to deal not just with mood boost as my SSRIs didn’t work but also “boredom” of life which Kratom cured but in the end made my life worse. I’m somewhat convinced my bipolar disorder was misdiagnosed and I have ADHD, but don’t really want to be on an addictive substance like adderall. It explains a lot in my life, but it’s hard to distinguish between ADD/ADHD and mood disorders, and you can have a combo of both. Anyway of course the doctors knew nothing about Kratom so I warned them. I’m upset rn with no response from the psychiatrist… if I don’t switch up my antidepressants and have to cut Valium cold turkey as a result of me leaving my old psychiatrist well it looks as if I’m on my death bed. Trying to stay positive as it’s only (a few hours from) day 38, unfortunately I refuse to touch the sludge again, so I will be struggling. It seems to be fine throughout the day mood wise but nighttime is when the anheondia and depression kick in. I’m sure it’ll get better in time I have not given up hope!!! I’ve already seen improvements, so just day by day I trudge along. Anyway I made this post just to recommend people to see a dr to check their vitamins/kidneys and whatever else! It’s part of recovery and taking care of yourself, and lack of vitamins can lead to mood issues (such as vitamin d). Anyway sorry for the long post, just glad my kidneys are ok.",3

I was taking anywhere from 25-35 gpd for 2 years straight. I figured it was time for me to quit since I started noticing it ruining my life and my relationships with loved ones. I couldn’t wait to get home from my girlfriends to dose and I would sneak around my friends and family bringing kratom with me everywhere and taking it in the bathroom. I stopped going to the gym, I stopped playing guitar, I stopped enjoying life and the only thing that mattered was when I was going to dose again. I couldn’t bear to keep living like that especially since I want to start a family with my gf. 

I tried quitting cold turkey several times and never could get past a day (pathetic I know) but that’s how addicted I was to this stuff. I figured a taper was the only way so I went down to about 5 g from 30 g in a matter of a week and then jumped. I threw out my stash and prepared for the worst. 

Omg the first 2 days were super rough. Absolutely zero sleep and the horrendous skin crawling restlesness felt unbearable, but I stuck it through and I’m glad I did. I feel a bit better today and actually went to the gym. It made a huge difference in my mood. The only thing that’s holding me back is this unbearable restlessness at night but I know it’ll get better with time. Can’t wait to be done with this stuff forever.",5

This was my first trip abroad to work remote and stay as long as I wanted.  Feeling free as a bird and just wrapping up my first sold out group coaching program for men’s emotional and spiritual development.  I had just started dating the love of my life, we randomly met in a Clubhouse room LOL.  She planned to come down to Tulum but before she did I started ingesting kratom at a restaurant that served it down there.  I fucking loved it and made a decision to “manage” it.  Off and on use but mostly consistent until 5 days ago.  I was nowhere near thinking I relapsed this whole time.  Until yesterday it really really hit me…it’s time to be courageous and honest with myself.  I’m experiencing a devastating ego death.  I’ve relapsed and I no longer have almost 9 years of sobriety.  I have 5 days.  My behavior, without a doubt, is confirmation of a relapse.  I’m no dummy.  My old self felt powerful.  I’m grieving the loss of it, in addition to losing my baby blanket of kratom.  I owe so much to my girlfriend right now. She has been a powerful mirror for me to see how I’m showing up as a man. If I wasn’t in this relationship, I truly feel my addiction would’ve continued to take a turn for the worst. I want a family someday, I want to be a light in the world like I once was, I want to be there for her in the ways that she deserves…the list is endless.  The three indispensable requirements for recovery are honesty, willingness and open mindedness. It’s time that I practice what I have preached for so long to others and start out on this path as a newcomer. I have hope and faith that I’m being guided and that I’m doing the right thing.  Humility is my practice right now.  And I’m choosing to softly surrender.  To befriend the grief.  It is the path of healing.  Keep up the good fight brothers and sisters🤍",8

New here. Would really really like to quit. I’ve started taking less. 
I’d like to know if having a very weak stomach, and feeling extremely DIZZY (also having weird feeling, audible, digestion), is a side effect of quitting or tapering. 
Just wondering if something is wrong with my stomach or it’s the lack of the usual amt of Kratom. 
On days where I take much less I can barely eat and when I do my heart starts racing right after and I can barely see straight.
(I don’t know exactly how much I take bc I put it in a sneaky water bottle on the DL, but I don’t think it’s more than say 4-5 tbsp a day). Been using it for about 6 months-every single day. The shame and depression is so real.

Thank you so much for any input, encouragement, experiences, etc.",7

&#x200B;

Hello guys.  I'm a 35 year old man with about 3.5 years of using this crap.  I have about 7 years of addiction under this 34 sized belt.  The first half being pain pills and the second half being kratom.  I'm no different than any of you.  Life got tough and I turned to numbing agents to get through it and that turned into full blown addiction.  

About 1 year ago, I began to experience what I'd call a mental shutdown.  I began to audit my life and what I realized was that I have hardly no friends, an unfulfilling career, and a complete breakdown of a long term relationship.  I have a very respected and well paid career but I'm completely miserable in it.  It doesn't suit my strengths whatsoever and it highlights my weaknesses.  I believe this is where drugs began.  As a result, everything else goes out the window.  The hole only gets deeper with inaction.

&#x200B;

So I began to try to fix areas of my life with no success.  While nothing seemed to work, my gut began telling me ""Nothing will get better until your mind is clear"".  I took this as you have to quit kratom before you can start repairing your life.  Happy to report I'm three weeks clean and that the acutes were bearable but my mental is a mess.  Luckily its a more stable mess, haha.  Brain fog is by far the worst thing I'm experiencing.  For example, somehow I managed to sit at my desk yesterday and not log into any program.  The only thing I accomplished was turning my computer on.  That's 8 hours worth!

&#x200B;

So with all that said, I was considering going to a 12 step program.  I was pumped and now that the day has come, I'm very nervous.  I'm very nervous to have to abstain from all substances.  All ""fun"" activities I'm associated with is centered around booze.  Opiates has always been my thing but I can be known to pound beer.  I'm actually scared to death because I don't know any different.  

I know this is a very case by case situation but have yall quitting all substances produced a better result?",9

Hello everyone ! This message to help more than one because I didn't find anything that resembled my story, and it's often welcome to find a story that's similar enough to our own to get a good feel for it. But I need some kratoman to guide me in my story.

3 years ago I had a huge burn-out at work, to save myself, yes I say save myself because I had very dark thoughts, I was put on 40mg of vallium (which for me is a huge dose, when I think about it) once stabilized and having changed jobs, I started my withdrawal process. I am currently on 7mg of Tranxene, which is equivalent to 3.5mg of Vallium (I switched from Vallium to Tranxene because the Vallium had a paradoxical effect on me which was not cool).

Anyway, all that to say, I stumbled upon kratom, and I used this herb every year for a short period of time to help me get down my benzos. It worked well to get me down from 40mg to 20mg, then I switched to tranxene at 25mg a day and my second kratom phase to get down to 15mg of tranxene.

Each year, being currently self-employed, I got caught up in the turmoil of continuing the kratom to help me be more productive and when I saw the first signs of withdrawal effects, I would impose a cold turkey.

The first year I really abused kratom at the end, thinking that there was very little addiction, well I can tell you that I was a mess! I think I was at 30 grams a day for 3-4 months. I don't remember how long it took me to wean myself off, damn I should have made a little note of it.

The second year, so last year, I managed quite a bit because I was taking a lot of breaks, and since I was doing a lot of sports on the days I wasn't using, the addiction didn't really set in, but I know that at the end I was taking maybe 20 grams and I didn't feel much. I then did a cold turkey again, and again I didn't take notes to guide me the next few times.

This year! June 4 I receive my order, maeng da green and maenga red, my two favorites. I manage to keep my consumption healthy, I take breaks, I take advantage of my weekends of sport to empty my toxins, etc... But lately, I got caught up with my work, a lot of backlog to catch up and I took daily for 3 weeks and a half. I took 2 doses of 6 grams, one at noon, one at 4-5pm. Again, I didn't feel the tolerance rising strangely, but towards the end I felt the lack between two doses. Again, last Saturday, July 31, 5pm, last intake and cold turkey!

My symptoms :

Sunday: Good night all the same, I get up at 11 am, but very irritable, the stomach knotted and the impression that my diaphragm is all blocked. Fatigue, desire to do nothing.

Monday: Short night, night awakenings, irritable and the restless legs syndrome are strong in the morning, which pushes me to get up very early. Again I want to do nothing, but I force myself to do something without charcoal. Always this blocked diaphragm. I made myself a 10km run with a good hot shower, I drink in parallel a lot of water and I take food supplements such as magnesium, l-theanine, ashwagandha and quinton plasma (sea water)

Tuesday: This morning, at 1:30 am, a huge peak of the restless legs syndrome, I was just moving and going crazy, and I fell asleep I do not know how, while fighting against these syndromes, I wake up at 6 am with a pronounced impatience and irritability.

So I am exactly at 68h after my last kratom intake which was 6 grams (Yes, the last days before the cold turkey I decreased from 12 to 6 grams in 3 days to get the thing going)

I just took a Temesta to try to calm me down a little bit, but it doesn't calm me down very much, I was thinking of taking it once a day for 3-4 days (As I'm withdrawing from tranxene, I don't want to increase my tolerance either) until everything calms down, but if it doesn't do anything for me, so much the worse.

Wednesday, it's been 89 hours since I took kratom, yesterday during the day I was really tired, I went to sit on my couch around 6pm and I was able to take a mini nap of 1h30... Bad idea, I didn't close my eyes for a single second of the night, impossible to sleep, hyper violent! And when I started to doze off, bim a big restless legs syndrome that comes to kill me permanently during the night around 5am... I really feel like I'm more sick than the last times... I don't know what's going on...

Thursday, I forced myself not to take a nap on Wednesday, the day went by with little motivation but I was still able to do my daily tasks and some work I had to do. I manage to eat a good pizza, I am quite calm in front of the TV, but I do not sleep as easily as I would like even after a sleepless night. Around 1am the restless legs syndrome appears again in a quite pronounced way. I lie down on the sofa and pedal in the void to help me. I fall asleep I do not know how! An alarm clock at 4am, I manage to fall back asleep with luck. I wake up at 07h30 with a nervousness. After getting up it passes. I am not yet at the top of my form but I see improvements, but I am impressed by this syndrome of legs without rest which returns very strong each night. I am currently at 114 hours without Kratom.

Do you think I'm slowly coming to the end of my withdrawal effects given my short period of daily intake? It still seems pretty intense to me, last year was like cat pee! Maybe I'm writing to you now and tomorrow everything will be back to normal.

I'm waiting for your advice, and I'll try to keep you informed of my improvement to help other users.

Have a good day !",4

I had to be the one to end it, not just by running out. It was so hard & I cried while I was doing it. I felt in that moment the mourning of a 5 year relationship. Sadness, loss, grief, but it was also healing. Pouring it out was a ritual. I was sacrificing something important to me so I could get the gift of reclaiming my mind, my neurochemistry.

28 full days. How did I get here??? 

This quit began with my uncontrollable crying, and such assurance of the fact that I was going to fail. And yet somehow, I persevered. 

My lingering symptoms include brain fog and as of yesterday, intense anxiety. Just run-of-the-mill PAWS stuff. 

I run every single day, and I walk at least 2 miles every single day. I get outside and breathe in the sun. I eat well. And I can honestly say that these things alone are more powerful than any supplement. Hot showers still help me too. Especially the anxiety.

I’m hoping that my next four weeks will bring relief from this brain fog. I need my cognition back more than anything else right now. 

I’ll keep posting as much as I can, but the further out I get, the less I think about my quit anymore. Just on big milestone days.

Throughout this taper my micro-scale has been my guide. 100% indispensable. I've been very strict with myself (a first for me in life) so I'm a little worried about being able to stick to my sched while traveling. 

Thinking I'll have to take my scale, as silly as that feels. I've capped some of the strain I'm tapering with for the actual traveling part, weighing to make sure I know exactly how much to take in cap form.

Anyhow, I think I can figure it out, but because I'm in very mild WD consistently these days my anxiety is over-indexing how badly I will fuck things up. 

Anyone that was on a strict taper schedule have to do any sudden travel? How did you handle it.",1

I owe much thanks to this community for those 25 days! I was on about 10 to 12 grams/day for 2 years and daily prescribed opiates for over 5 years before that. I tapered down to 2g/day over a couple months then quit for 3 days and dosed on the 4th. I decided to throw it all out 25 days ago and haven’t looked back. 

I have felt so guilty and hateful towards myself for years of my so-called “pain management” addiction that I have just denied I ever had a problem. Finally I’m seeing my reality and am trying my best to celebrate my accomplishment instead of self-loathing.

It’s been an up and down event…some days good and some not so good but the first week was the worst. Every day since then has been easy compared to that first week. I’m starting to feel my zest for life come back and am enjoying my favorite activities again.

I do have PAWS related issues but they are not major. My sleep hasn’t been affected too badly (melatonin helped a lot that first week). My restless legs went away after about 2 weeks. Depression and anxiety have improved a lot but occasionally I’ll have a bad depression day and it hits me hard. It depends a lot on my sleep I think. 

I think my worst side effect right now is the tiredness I feel later in the day and diarrhea every few days. Thankfully it hasn’t affected my weight (loss or gain). Other than the diarrhea, everything else seems manageable.

The only question I have for the community is, how long did your diarrhea last??? I’d love for that to get better soon!

Thank you all so much for your posts and comments to other posts. I don’t know how I would have woke up and managed to quit if it wasn’t for this community!",5

Way easier than expected,"Hey everyone this is long but hopefully it helps someone. I wanted to share my success story on this 2nd quit, but first i wanted to share my super difficult 1st quit a few years ago. December 2018 I had been using 2 years at about 60gpd. I was also using massive amounts of caffeine by drinking yerba mate, basically all day along with it. So one day my wife made a bullet proof coffee (butter, mct oil and coffee) and asked if i wanted to try it,  and i drank it. Later that day i had a very weird pain in my chest.  For the following 3 days, my chest had sharp pains in it. On that 3rd day, I decided to quit kratom cold turkey along with caffeine. Thus began the hardest few months of my life. My chest pains didnt really go away until after 4 months. The chest pains made the cold turkey 1000% harder because any little bit of anxiety would intensify the pain and sleeping was basically impossible. A few months later I started using kratom again because I was still in the paws phase and didnt believe it would let up....
Now comes the good part of the story. When i started using again, i knew i never ever wanted to get back to my 60gpd again. Around the end of 2019 I was at the height of my usage for this time, at around 18-20gpd. I was measuring 2 tsp x3 times a day. I will give you a big tip. I bought a ""daily powdered greens"" container and used that for my kratom and just kept the scooper in the container so it was very easy to dose exactly how I wanted. I was aware that i needed to reduce over time this time. I then switched to 1/2 tsp scoops instead of 1 tsp and went from 2 tsp to 3x 1/2 tsp per dose. I stayed here for a few months and then dropped to 1 tsp 3x times per day. I continued dropping to a smaller scooper every few months. I eventually dropped all the way down to 1/4 tsp 2x per day for a few weeks. I would say i would cut my current dose by 1/4 every 3 months. The last 3 days, i dropped to 1/8 scoop 2 times per day. I then jumped. Along the way, through my long taper, rls is really the only thing i noticed, except for agitation and easy anger for a few days after a reduction. I got some cbd, blackseed oil and a magnesium ""sleep"" suppliment that i used at night (and still do). Honestly, this has been incredibly easy so far. I know its possible the paws havent kicked in yet, but its been very easy going the very long taper route, so far. Im at 32 days today and I honestly havent thought about kratom after the first week after jumping. The sleep hasnt even been an issue this time. I do excercize a few days a week as well. I just wanted to encourage you all that if you do a long taper, its possible to jump with very little difficulty. Believe me, ive jumped cold turkey and its sooo fucking hard compared to this long taper jump.",10

I used stimulants to get off once for about 2 months but that was incredibly self destructive. Ended up back on Kratom because, well, it helped me get my shit together quicker after the shit storm of a 6 month tweak binge and move into society with as little discomfort as possible. Fast forward another 6 months things are going good, other than the fact I’m still taking Kratom daily and life is basically dull, Kratom makes me l simply “ok.” Never excited, never too sad, although sometimes I think it adds to the severity of anxiety type/panic symptoms. Life’s good for the most part, but I hate being dependent on Kratom, telling people I’m sober when Kratom is still there. It so subtly robs you, like an Agent of Treachery(my favorite magic card), stealing away pieces of you that only those closest to you would notice. Otherwise, no one knows, and why should they? It’s legal, it’s dirt cheap. They need to know because getting off of this is not cool at all. I’m trying to adhere to a tapir so I can still function at work because I’m not positioned well enough to take 2 or 3 weeks off. I dropped to 12g yesterday spread out over 4-5 hour periods, so basically a 4,4,4 and got basically no sleep, I feel like a truck hit me even now after taking 6g. I should add it’s only been 48+ hours since I quit speed as well. I don’t even know what the point of my post is other than to say holy shit this sucks, I don’t want to throw in the towel like I always do, but it almost seems like the good outweighs the bad at this point. What supplements do y’all take to help? Phenibut? Any of the Race-tams? I’m sure lots of b vitamins and multi. I’ve access to benzos if needed, which, yes, just to sleep. I’m fine with pot, granted it would help me eat but it doesn’t do much but cause more anxiety. Have any of you successfully tapered and how did you do it? I’m just trying to find a functional baseline right now because that 4,4,4, I don’t think was high enough based on how I feel today even after 6 grams at 9:30 this morning.

This is my second post on the sub. I'm not sure when I started using kratom daily, but I believe it was around the middle of April.

I used kratom to help with WD after telling my doctor I wanted to try and see how I'd do without pain meds. I was in pain management for about 5 years or so for chronic pain.

To my surprise, I didn't experience any WD remotely close to what people on various forums/subreddits experienced. Maybe a few days of lethargy.

Anyway, my normal GPD became around 2.4 GPD (4 x .6g daily). A couple weeks ago I started taking 3 capsules. Last week I started taking 2.5 capsules, and day by day I'd lessen the amount in that half full capsule. 

Yesterday was my first day of taking only 2 capsules. So a total of 1.0 - 1.2g.

Here's where it gets tricky. I've always waited until the afternoon to take the first capsule, and around 7pm for the other. I'm not too sure how exactly to begin the taper down from there.

Heck, I know some of you will be rolling your eyes at such a low dose, but the anxiety is real.

What would you all recommend?",1

I had an intense craving outside of smoke shop hanging out with my best bud here. He is nonjudgmental and cool and I told him man I’m gonna go get some Kratom. He said I will kick your ass bro your killing it and I don’t want to support u throwing it down the drain. Absolute legend move.

I thanked him and I didn’t buy the Kratom. Then for 24 hours STRAIGHT my mood went to shit and i suffered the constant anxiety of trying to convince myself to dose. I had plans man. It was fucking weird because it felt like the devil was the one talking and it was all I could hear. 

I did shit like twitch my whole body to try and stop it. Yell No! Out loud to myself. I told my wife everything I was thinking at times just straight up like I’m thinking of ways I can get away from you so that I can use again. That was a huge help.

My entire mood was fucking killed. All the acutes forgotten all of the Hope got buried somewhere it was crazy team. I cried this morning I was so tired and so angry. All of a sudden my acute symptoms start coming back. I’m sneezing all day, yawning having weird brain zaps.

And you know what?

I fucking made it man. I never have done that before and really witnessed it so closely. When I hit that hopeless I’m usually done for.

Today I surrendered. Today I was in control instead of the devil. 

After 24 hours I was playing guitar and all of a sudden the spell broke. Joy snuck in and all hope was restored instantaneously. I’m here now just woke up after 2 hours and I’m still good man. 

Stay strong out there you guys. Soon I’ll tell you all the cool stuff that is happening for me as part of this quit.

Life is turning so much better it’s almost unfathomable. Almost. But I’m doing it. You can too.

As most of you probably have experienced- K really lowers you’re sex drive.
The first two years, I honestly took it lots of times to „stay in game for longer“ … but I totally got fucked up by it the last year (5th year of abusing it).
I noticed a dramatically lowered sex drive - before I really loved to have sex ever day or at least a couple of times a week.
During the last year, I really had to force myself for once every 10 days or so (also my girlfriend suffers from that).
Im currently at day 9 of CT from 30GPD - the last time I quit I noticed an increased sex drive at around the 5th day. But this time there is totally no change.
Have you experienced something similar? How long did it take for you?

Also I’ve read K messes with men’s testosterone level pretty bad - did you experience that too? And did you recover by yourself?
If I’m fully recovered - I’m gonna do a blood check and hopefully everything is back normal…",1

While I don’t feel so great, I’m choosing to accept that and be patient. Im pretending im just going through a hard time and I honestly stopped thinking about Kratom until I had some back pain earlier today and knew it was my kidneys. Definitely have some brain fog. Kinda going through the motions but also thinking a LOT about my high school years (right before I started using Kratom) and grieving my breakup and on and off again relationship from 4-5 years ago which is what turned me to this shit in the first place (and the stress of starting college). It’s ok though. I’d rather feel like shit than take a mind altering supplement that honestly terrifies me. I know I’ll go to school and I’ll be so busy it won’t cross my mind as much. I find myself thinking about it less and less. Obsessing over it less and less. Trying to live in the moment instead of counting the days. I enjoyed a nice walk today with a dog my sister is pet sitting. I feel very fragile and vulnerable but I’m strong. Sometimes it scares me when I forget about Kratom and feel just dissociated and a little confused. Don’t know if that’s normal. Anyway I think I’ll be posting less cause I don’t want to even think about it, I don’t feel the need to mope over every symptom because I know healing takes time. I’m tricking my brain into forgetting about Kratom and just assuming I’m going through a rough break up. Which essentially I am. Kratom was once my friend, then it became a nightmare. Anyway just wanted to update everyone. I definitely view the world in a different light and think patterns I thought 4 years ago and even though I would call today a bad day I don’t really care cause I’m not letting my emotions control me. Mind over matter. I forget about it completely and feel normal when I’m busy with other people. So stay outside and be busy. Exercise, even just a walk is better than nothing. Peace and praying for days to get better (and I think they are). But it’s very slow. Like 1% a day.",7

The last two days have been the hardest so far. The crappy physical withdrawals have mostly gone except for rls and sleepless nights up until 3am. But the first week was easier because I had an elevated mood and a positive mental attitude which made everything so much easier. Today and yesterday I not only felt fatigued with crawling skin, but I was down. Especially today. I didn’t really do much with my day, which I felt awful about but I wasn’t willing to put the gears in motion to do something, so it was a negative feedback loop. I started building anxiety up thinking that there’s something seriously wrong with me. I started looking at diseases online and what their symptoms are. I finally realized and became aware that this is just the mental aspect of me healing. It’s a rollercoaster and you have to hold on for dear life. Today was the first day I had thoughts of buying more krap creep into my head. But I try to squash those thoughts and remember that it won’t do me any good. In fact, it will do me harm. Squirming around in bed last night while trying not to wake my girlfriend up was horrible. Fighting it made it worse and I started getting really frustrated. I finally went out to the couch and eventually fell asleep around 3am.

I stopped a couple times, but up to about 75 days ago I was in the 30GPD range for pain management.

Shivering, feeling terrible, anxiety, depression, etc. Why??? I couldn't even make it to the 5th hour without major symptoms, and that's my usual time in between doses. 

Is it that I'm having some kind of psychosomatic withdrawal just from knowing that I'm stopping? When I jumped from 30GPD I was all motivated and hopeful until the restlessness/insomnia got me, now trying to jump from 12 I'm freaking out. I should be courageous and resolute but my mind just dwells on what's coming and I can't make it stop. I have support from a counselor once a week and also a NP who got me some clonidine and gabapentin today. I'm afraid to even try to jump again even with this stuff.

I’m fairly new here, just joined this sub a few days ago but I’ve been reading a lot from here for quite a while. Have been contemplating quitting for a year and had begun tapering slowly for about a year or so. Was taking the extracts a few years back and quit with some horrible withdrawals but I somehow made it… only to start taking the powder a year or so later. Stayed steady at 3 doses a day at 7 grams per dose for a while and then decided to really start to taper off. Got down to 4 grams a dose twice a day for what seems like forever, I just didn’t really want to go lower than that until recently when I started having panic attacks. After the attacks started happening I started rapidly tapering every few days, down to about 2 grams twice a day but then after a while my second dose of the day would trigger a full blown panic attack and after about the second day of that happening I decided to take it just once a day. Then a few days later I decided it best to try jumping off. Today is the third day without any kratom at all coincidentally today I went to a psychiatrist about my panic attacks and anxiety and got a diagnosis and a couple prescriptions. One to take on a daily basis and another to take once a panic attack comes on. The thing is, my anxiety is making me a bit scared of taking my panic attack medicine because it’s only been 3 days since I stopped taking kratom and im afraid that if I take my meds that it will interact with my panic attack meds. Is three days enough time to clear it from my system and be able to take my anti panic meds? Sorry for the long post.",3

I have been lurking for a bit and am currently on my way off a 7 year 60gpd habit. for context, I quit CT (almost, 5-day taper from 60 to 0) and was off completely for 5 days. After those 5 days, I started taking small amounts again for sleep to try to reduce the severity of PAWS. The plan was to take 12g a night max to try to recover my 5 nights of sleep lost for up to 2 weeks, then cut in half for 1 week, and then jump off, however after only 5 days or so, I started to slip, and I was up to 20gpd by day 9. I had this kSafe thing lying around so I decided to make use of it to help me get back on track.

If you haven't heard of these things, they are pretty cool. It's just a container with a lid that locks on. It has a dial and a screen, and all you do is turn the dial to the amount of time you want it to remain locked for, and press start. It will then lock, and it will not unlock until that time runs out (there is no override, which is the point). So now, if I have a plan to give myself 12 grams a day for the next 2 weeks, I weigh out that amount and lock the rest up for 2 weeks. If I want to slip and take more on any given day, I'll have to eat that decision on a later day, adding cost to slipping up.

The real value is in its ability to preserve your willpower. Modern research on willpower suggests it's like a muscle in that it can get stronger with 'exercise', but it can also get fatigued with overuse. Normally with a taper, you essentially have to make the decision to stick to it all day, every day, for the entire duration of the taper. You always have the option to slip up, and it takes significant willpower not to. With something like this, it allows you to make the decision and exercise your willpower only once for each step down, which keeps you from getting fatigued. It has been really helpful for me in the past for other things, and I think it will really help me get back on track here as well. I was really surprised to see that there was no mention of it on this sub already, so I hope it can help some of you who are struggling to taper. You can do this!

&#x200B;

Pros:

* Conserve your willpower by making one decision every x days rather than countless micro-decisions each day

Cons:

* Kinda expensive (\~$70-80) for how cheap you'd expect given the materials (they're kind of a monopoly right now)
* The screen can break easily if dropped

I bought regular leaf capsules and would take 2-4 grams a day (I don’t like taking large doses of regular capsules cuz it makes my stomach upset). Throughout the weekend I noticed some loose stools all weekend and stomach upset which I thought was strange cuz when I was taking one extract capsule per day it would pretty much constipate me until the next day. So today is day one without any kratom. I actually think switching from the extract over to regular kratom was a smart move because the regular powder did not give me that warm euphoria the extracts always did (probably because I never took over 5 grams in one day).

Wanted me to check-in to detox/rehab.

Bit of a disappointment. Nothing against detox and rehab. I will seek those out if I can't quit on my own. 13 years ago I kicked a 3-year sub maintenance dose on my own, I can do this too. I had clonidine and gaba when I kicked the subs, they were definitely helpful.

So I guess I'll be going without those! Time to buy a heating pad and some icy hot.

Started tapering early July from 35-40 gpd. Down to 8.5 gpd split into 6. Six might seem high to some of you all, but I was used to dosing small but all day long. Sometimes once an hour.

Start of taper was very rough, middle of the taper wasn't too bad. Now that I'm in sub 10 gpd zone, really starting to feel it again. 

Planning on jumping on 8/13. Till then I'm just going to keep whittling it down. Maybe try going down to x4 a day.

I'm a 32 year old female and have been using kratom for a little over 3 years. My dose was upward to 40-45 gpd. One week I cut down to 30 gpd. The following week I jumped down to 20 gpd. The last week I was between 15-20 but had a hard time cutting down more so I decided to CT today. My job gave us a 5 day vacation so I figured now or never. 

These last few weeks, even when I was dosing, it already didn't do what it did for me weeks prior. My mental state was focused on how much I wanted to stop and that this had complete and total control over me. The first few months of taking kratom, my life felt wonderful. I was okay being alone after the end of a toxic relationship. I felt confident at work, motivated, and ready to take on the world. Slowly but surely that shifted, I became more isolated, and the depression started setting in. I felt it I took more, maybe, just maybe I would achieve what I had in the beginning. I never reached the feeling I had in the beginning, ever again.

At the time, I started noticing physical changes. These were slow but progressed into.. My hair thinning, my skin appearing dull, looking exhausted and somewhat lifeless. These last few months, I have felt a slow detoriation. The stress at work, my new relationship, and a huge transition I'm about to make with being accepted into nursing school.

I previously ruined my chances at nursing school with my alcohol and ketamine addiction. I got sober. And gave myself time (years) to collect my thoughts and take a look at what I want out of life. My cravings became an issue at about 1 year sober and that's when someone introduced me to kratom. I enrolled back in school and took a class a semester. What I noticed was school was way harder on kratom. I was nodding off, not piecing simple concepts, and lost ability to focus. I pushed through though. Now, I know I do not want this to be the case.

What's motivating me is, I've felt the feeling of complete sobriety. I know it's achievable. It's hard yet beautiful. Being able to feel and process every emotion is the hardest yet most rewarding experience I've ever known. We are strong. Much of it is mind over matter. Doing things you don't want to. For example, reaching out to those you can trust and will support you, taking a walk, eating healthy, taking naps, reading, yoga, and positive self-reflection.

So right now, I'm feeling a little anxious. My whole body hurts. I'm pretty tired. But I will tell you, hangovers have been worse. I know day 2 is more than likely going to be harder..but here is what is motivating me:

1. School and achieving my dream
2. A strong and healthy relationship with my boyfriend and his kids
3. My physical strength back and beautiful hair
4. A glow to my face
5. An appreciation in music, nature, and the things I am doing in general
6. Having feelings
7. Adequate sleep
8. A healthy diet 
9. Being able to and wanting to exercise
10. Mending of relationships with friends and family
11. Addressing depression and anxiety in healthy ways (ie therapy, meditation)

Here's what I'm currently doing and taking:
1. No plans for 5 days
2. Comfy clothes 
3. Bought a bunch of water, Gatorade, Pedialyte, and food enriched with protein and probiotics
4. Supplements: multivitamin ( New Chapter calming one), biotin, collagen protein peptide powder, a vitamin with calcium/magnezium/zinc, vitamin D3, fish oil, liver detox supplement, immunity probiotic, immunity sleep that has melatonin in it.

Be gentle with yourself. I know this is the calm before the storm atleast for a couple weeks. I'm okay with it because I know the best is yet to come and this excites me. This out ways the negative I'm experiencing right now. I hope this helps some that are struggling. I know I have been. But I'm ready to conquer the demon and have admitted complete and total defeat. I'll check in later to give an update. Best of luck to all. You're not alone. We got this. ❤",14

2021-08-03 09:25:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/ox3foi/going_back_to_old_job/,Going back to old job,"Hey all, 

First of all, thank you to everyone here for being so supportive every time anyone checks in. I'm coming up on 9 months next week and couldn't have done it without the information and ongoing support provided by this sub. Literally no one even knew I had an addiction until I was months clean.

Now here's where I'm at. I was laid off from my job last March when covid hit. I was not legally allowed to work the first couple months due to regulations anyway, and this messed with my identity a little. It should be said I really did not enjoy my work before shutdown. It gave me constant and chronic pain, not to mention enormous emotional stress. Kratom was my crutch since day 1 and I have literally never worked a day in the field without it. After being laid off I coped by telling myself it was a pointless job and I leaned into lots of drinking and more kratom than I'd ever consumed. 

We're now almost a year and a half since I stopped working. I've been working other jobs to get by, but haven't picked up anything else remotely as well paying. I told myself over and over I would use my newfound free time to learn a new skill to get myself out from this gigantic career rut that I'm in. I haven't learned a thing. 

This does not bother me. I managed to quit kratom in this time off and stay quit. It's been a massive improvement in my quality of life. It takes many steps to get where you want and I'm only a couple steps in to a better life. This all being said, I'm now seriously considering going back to my old job. My health problems I had from work have disappeared, likely from some rest, but I'm guessing also from quitting kratom.

But I'm very scared. I used kratom every day, 5-6 times per work day. I would take a half dose of capsules as soon as my alarm clock blared in the morning, then go back to sleep so when my next alarm went off, I could get out of bed more easily. Then I would take another dose of capsules exactly 75 minutes before the start of my shift, so it would peak through the morning. I would dose again immediately at lunch so it would peak again for my afternoon, then another dose for my last couple hours. I was then so fried I'd get home completely exhausted, and inevitably take my largest dose of the day, staving off anxiety until around bedtime. I'd have fitful sleep and wake up with a sense of impending doom, until that first alarm dose hit me again. It got so regular, I hated my off days because my withdrawal made me useless. So I started using on off days, which made my tolerance skyrocket. It began to get harder and harder to regulate my doses. Negative effects grew, and I couldn't stop. Work was a factor, but as evidenced by my lay off, it was really about the drug more than the situation.

Now I'm here, in such an insanely better place mentally and kratom free, wondering what work will be like. I wonder if it was never as bad as I had told myself it was. Was it just the kratom convincing me I couldn't do it without it? That's what happened with everything else. Why would work be different? 

But I also recognize on those days I wanted to quit my job, kratom was the thing that made it easy to grin and bear it. I could at least make good money. Hell, I've been slowly eating at those savings until now, when I really need more money.

How have all of you coped in this situation? Removing triggers is crucial in fighting addiction. But this is my trained profession. I don't like it and want change, but right now I need money bad. I don't plan on using kratom at all. I'm so far beyond wanting it at this point. But I don't know how I'll cope when things get tough again. I've been really easy on myself through the quitting process as to improve my chances of success. This will be a real challenge.

TLDR: never did job without kratom. 9 months clean, need to go back to work for money. Anxious about working sober",5

I have one week off from my orthopedic surgery residency. Going to try to make this time count. Looking for advice and support.,"Tried tapering like 15 fucking times. I always lose control. I work in emergency Orthopedic surgery and have insane hours in residency. So every time I try to taper I end up folding and it’s not working. I wish I was strong enough to make that work but I don’t think I can. Not to brag on myself at all but to paint a clear picture, I’m a pretty smart guy. Or at least I would like to think so. I’ve made it into a surgical orthopedic trauma residency program and have just moved to the wonderful state of Texas. They have shops here for kratom that they did not have right used to live. I can buy it at gas stations in my old med school town but here they have full shops with a vast array of high-quality products. The effects are much better but also much more addictive and much more expensive. Contrary to common conception, surgeons in the residency don’t make fucking shit for money. It’s important to me to get off this and to be clear minded going into the operating room. Most of my life up to this point I believed that operating while on kratom would actually benefit me. I assumed it would give me energy and keep me positive and as I still believe aspects of that would be true I however i think it would be more detrimental based on more experience. In case there were a situation where I didn’t have any and got sick and tired mid operation, or took too much and got a little too manic it’s just wildly unsafe for the patients. That being said I have a week of vacation starting yesterday and I went cold turkey yesterday morning. Slept about two hours last night, my wife doesn’t know what’s going on for my own dignity and mental strength I have to act like nothings happening. I’m going to just say that I’m sick. I know that’s probably a bad idea because emotional support (that’s why I’m talking to you guys) is important but being independent and being mentally strong is what got me as far as I am so I feel like that’s what will keep me going. If I start relying on other people for things then I become too weak on myself and I collapse. It’s happened before. I just need advice and encouragement. Being a person with medical knowledge I have a pretty good understanding of how these things work and I’m taking the obvious supplements that have been recommended here. I also have gotten a gabapentin prescription as well as a few Xanax for those terrible sleepless nights. I’m well aware of the addictive qualities of those and luckily I hate both of them, they’re just good for sleeping and I maybe use them once every two months previously. This will be a short stent and a benzodiazepine withdrawal is the last thing on earth I wish to go through. I’m here for support from this community because we all suffer through the same hell. We haven’t even started talking yet but I love you all and I wish you the best. If there’s anything I can do to help you let me know, just talking to me will be a lot to help me. 
I’ll post as often as i can but people checking in on me and making me not feel alone will do more than anything. Thank you all and wish me luck.

I didn’t love my life before which lead me to Kratom in the first place as I was depressed. So. I need advice to find what’s missing out of life that lead me to this point.

I can’t imagine how much money I have spent on OPMS Kratom extracts. I’ve taken up to 6 on some days. They hardly even work anymore and mostly just satisfy a craving while often making me sick. 

I know the next few days will be tough. I got 14 days kratom free and relapsed about 3 weeks ago. I had 7 days shortly before those 14.

I've only been on this shit for a little under 3 months but I'm already dosing about 40 grams daily.  Well, it was much higher but I was indiscriminately and compulsively redosing countless times a day without measuring (I'd wager I was up to around 60 GPD) when I made the decision to get off this garbage.  My story goes as follows:  


I've been on Gabapentin (Neurontin) for roughly 7 years for diabetic neuropathy and I decided I no longer wanted to be on it.  So I figured kratom could be a useful aid in the detox process (it probably could have been but I lack the self control to use it responsibly...)  Shit quickly got out of control and I started developing some pretty severe stomach pain and what feels like pressure/inflammation around my liver and also in my back around my right kidney.  I recently had to find a new primary care physician (who's unaware of my kratom use at the moment) who had blood work done.  I go back in a week to see how my panels are.  


Now back to my plan.  I've been able to stabilize my dose at 40 GPD over the past 4 days.  When dropping the dose during a taper about how many grams do y'all drop and about how often?  I'm thinking I may drop the dose about 5 grams every other day.  I have a large amount of gabapentin at my disposal (I'll worry about getting off that later) that should aid in the process.  I'm also tapering with Agmatine.  Unfortunately I'm still dosing 4 times a day so I'm reducing each dose by a gram or two every few days (totaling 5 grams daily altogether.)  So far this hasn't been too unbearable and I've been able to do it without the aid of the Gabapentin.  I'm thinking that once I get the dose down to around 5 grams or so I'll jump off and use the gabapentin and possibly loperamide to finish it off.  


So I'm looking for any input, thoughts, or concerns from y'all.  I'm open to any and all suggestions.  Regardless, I'm over this shit.  Fortunately the withdrawal doesn't appear to last that long so I may speed up the taper depending on the severity of the withdrawal symptoms.  (Insomnia and restlessness are by far the worst symptoms).  And best of luck to the rest of you who are trying to kick this shit to the curb.  Kind regards.",4

I left work early the third day and took a really weird route home where I subconsciously knew I would drive by the K store. I drove by at a point where I hardly had any energy to stand up for the previous 3 days, but instantly had the energy to run a marathon when parked in front of the store... if we need any more proof that a lot of this is mental then we really must be crazy! Although at the time, knowing something is mental means absolutely nothing....

I am giving in to what I know and trying to get into rehab. I'm not sure if it's willpower I'm lacking or just general drive, or something entirely different, but rehab has worked for me in the past, I just need to make it stick this time.

I guess what I'm trying to say is, I was in a very dark place after my 3 days sobriety attempt. Laying in bed thinking about just wanting this anguish to go away and slowly convincing myself that the only solution was permanent sleep. But that isnt the only solution. For those of us who just cannot do this alone out in the real world, don't lose faith. There is no shame in admitting you are powerless over kratom and that your life has become unmanageable. There is also no shame on admitting that you need help. Help for some is a reddit sub, help for others are AA/NA meetings. And help for this stubborn ass addict is rehab. Just remember all our paths look different, and there is no ""right"" or ""best"" way to get sober. Just get there no matter how. It all looks so much prettier from the top of this horrible mountain we all have the luxury of climbing. And even if we fall down the first 10 feet a couple of times (or 20 times...), just remember there is always a way to get past them. ALWAYS. 

Good luck out there. Wishing everyone a happy recovery!",3

Sleep was rough and I feel low energy today.  But I’m feeling my positive emotions a bit more.  What a gift!  That’s the thing about substances that take away uncomfortable emotions, they typically take away from the pleasant ones too.  A little bit about me…ex opiate/heroin addict.  Been clean for almost 9 years off of everything.  I’ve always known to stay away from Kratom because I knew I’d like it too much.  But this last spring I was in Mexico on a solo vacation and there was a kratom/kava bar near my place where everyone would hang at.  I gave in to the temptation.  I “managed” it to the best of my ability and even took some off weeks but I knew in my heart of hearts that I was feeding into my addictive tendencies.  My usage increased and I started to feel unable to meet life on life’s terms without it.  That emotional rollercoaster is so familiar to me from my heroin days.  I live a really full, beautiful life these days and the kratom was starting to make life feel dull and monotonous.  It may sound extreme,  but the spiritual part of my brain started to feel distant and unimportant.  Almost as if cultivating a relationship with God became impossible while on kratom.  How sad!  I saw damn well where this train is headed, I almost lost everything with my heroin addiction and I AM NOT going to let kratom do the same.  Complete abstinence from all substances is the only way for me to live a good life and feel the nearness of God.  Just smashed a solid workout and ate a healthy meal.  One day at a time!  Thank you to each and every one of you for your vulnerability, it helped me realize even more how dark this drug is.  We got this!!!  Keep going!!!",17

From the beginning, I decided to pace myself for 90 days because most people seemed to be doing mostly ok by the 3 month mark. It seemed soooo far away and there were definitely times where I thought I for sure broke myself. I would literally be doing something *enjoyable* (like having a nice dinner with my family on Mother’s Day) not *enjoying* a single fricken moment, and feeling so guilty about it. 🙄🤦🏼‍♀️

At first, I only had enough energy to make it through the hour. Still had to do life, but I took everything one moment at a time and thought of it as a way relearn things sober. I was super gentle with myself, took each day, each hour, each minute slowly, and tried to do everything to keep myself healthy. Day 10 felt like months in the making. I was so exhausted but some things started changing inside me. “Being by myself” started shifting to “spending time with myself” —> huge insight for me! 💗

As this mindset progressed, I realized that my new bestie (me)…could be ok with anything that came my way. Even if I had to be ok with not being ok…be ok with being extremely fucking uncomfortable. All. The. Time. 🤣

I had heard people talk about this practice but I was too deep with Kratom to actually experience it. Withdrawal gives us a good amount of suffering to work with, and makes it much easier to practice watching the internal world unfold because it’s so torturous you literally can’t miss it. When we quit Kratom, the internal world completely crumbles so it’s a huge opportunity to build something new that actually makes living a true pleasure. 

For me, the foundation of the new internal world was self-compassion and love for my own being. I literally had to rebuild the relationship with myself because shoving 25gpd day down my throat for 2.5 years had taken its toll. I kept tissues in my car and would drive around listening to music and balling my eyes out. Just nurturing myself and saying “you’ve been through so much, and it’s ok my love. I’m here for you now.” Maybe this sounds crazy to some people but I had to do this to rebuild the trust with myself again.

Doing shit like this has made the past 90 day a portal of growth for me. 🙏🏼 The howling winds of change started blowing and I completely surrendered to them. Usually I would’ve freaked out and held on to the status quo for dear life to keep everything under control….even if it meant relapsing. In order to really let go you have to be ok with whatever happens next even when it’s extremely uncomfortable. It’s all related: *Surrender. Self compassion. Being ok with whatever unfolds.* 💕

Are you going to beat yourself up for feeling the way you do or are you going to hold yourself in love and be the best friend to yourself that you’ve always needed? I continue to ask myself this every day.

Have you ever noticed that the inside of your palm fits perfectly with the bump (top of sternum which protects the heart) on your chest? Like a puzzle piece. Place your hand there. Feel the warmth of your hand and send love to yourself. ❤️ 90 days will come and go (if we are lucky) so use this journey of addiction to free a part of you and connect with the person who has been on this wild ride of life with you for all these years.

Wherever you are on this journey is exactly where you are supposed to be. There is nothing wrong with you. There is nothing wrong with this moment. Start with that assumption and be there for yourself as it unfolds. Sending love darlings. ❤️",55

Honestly I would prefer to quit CT, but I can't get time off right now. Usually I can handle minor withdrawal symptoms, but by now it has gotten to bad to properly funktion. 

How should I go on with my taper? 

Should I stay on the same dosage for a few days so my body can adjust to the lowered intake or should I take more again and take smaller steps reducing my intake? 

Do you guys know of anything else that could ease withdrawal in general?

I just finished five days in detox after fighting the green sludge for the last month. There were a few slip ups along the way but the majority of the days were kratom free, and even on the days where I did mess up I was taking less than half of my original dose which was an ounce. So five days back I decided that maybe it might benefit me to have zero access to kratom all together after I had went three days without it already, so that’s when I decided to ride out the worst of the acutes in detox. So far I’m feeling like I made the right decision. When I got out I had zero desire to go buy kratom like I FD up and did the last time, instead I came home, took a shower and went and got something to eat and have yet to feel any cravings for it. Over all it wasn’t a bad experience, yeah I got the hot and cold shit and the restless leg syndrome at first but they kept me pretty comfortable and the only narcotic they used was phenobarbital. The last couple of days were pretty awesome though other than feeling dumbed down by all the comfort meds, zero fucks were given about what people thought or said about me, conversation came almost naturally even though I have serious social anxiety problems, a few friendships were made and numbers exchanged and I was even flirting with a couple of the cute nurses and had them cracking up, the whole thing was very therapeutic really, I feel like I’ve found my spark for life again after losing it to kratom for more than three years. That dirty speedy paranoid feeling is gone too, I have more energy already, I walk different, talk different and I guess I am different now! I even found myself helping others through their problems and even had this kid that kinda stayed off to himself and didn’t speak to anyone for days totally opening up to me about how he lost his mom and wanted to get off the fentanyl and really be there for his kid (and god if you’re listening please look after that kid and his family and this whole kratom fiasco will have been worth it), but anyway if I can be this type of person when I don’t use kratom then I don’t ever want to see another bag again. And I’m not naive guys, I know that the paws are most likely coming and that the meds played a big part but the last time I went to detox just 24 hours off kratom and hadn’t even been trying to stop, the same meds helped the withdrawal but I still felt like garbage, but this time I was happy,optimistic,energetic and it was truly a joy to just sit and talk to people about some random bullshit all the way up to stuff that really matters... But anyway guys I just wanted to share my positive experience that I had after being off for around 8 days and I hope whoever is reading this has or gets to experience what it’s like to come back from what I consider to be worse than death itself, good luck everyone!",4

 This helped me a lot. If you don't want to get something for RLS from a doc potentially replacing one addiction with another something I do really helps.

Try this if you don't like meds. Lay on your back before you go to sleep. Place your arms by your sides with your palms down. Then put your legs up as if you are going to ride a bike and start doing the cycling motions with your legs while your hands are still at your side. Keep doing this until you feel some muscle pain and are exhausted. I mean really push yourself. The benefits of this are two fold. First it will make you tired and help you sleep, second it gives your muscles a good workout giving RLS less of a chance to affect your muscles and you get that exercise that helps you get thru withdrawal. It should help. Helps me. 

&#x200B;

 We're all in this together. I've relapsed a few times because I don't take any medication for frozen shoulder and kratom helped a bit. I decided though that I want this stuff out of my life. I may not succeed but I will damn sure try. I'll just deal with the pain with nothing and hope for the best.

 Don't let your body trick you into wanting more. It's lying to you. You don't need kratom, kratom needs you, it need a host to control.

 I don't know any of you, but I care about you all.  Just do this and get your life back.",8

My biggest fear is the RLS, which I know will crack me! However the only new symptom is increased pain sensitivity, but I can live with that. I’m officially at 2.5 GPD on a single dose and coasting. My plan is to now start tapering the single dose slowly, because I’ve got to remain functional for my child with multiple disabilities and to work to pay the bills as a single parent. However, I’ve been so encouraged and motivated by shaping my behavior this week and drastically cutting my daily consumption, I know I can do it. The hardest part was the first few days of not ‘watching the clock’ for my dose every 3.5 -4 hrs anymore and changing the pattern of my dosing behavior; this behavior schedule was so conditioned that I thought it would be my undoing. Although, I actually went 30-minutes past my scheduled single dose today because I really am trying to keep from doing the “clock watch”! I finally feel like it’s possible after over a decade of use that I can do this and be successful!

Ive been on kratom for a few years of daily use, and a few months ago lowered my usual random high dosages from around 60-80gpd to an even 30gpd precisely measured, as I am planning to quit so Im slowly tapering. It was a big drop when I first started the taper, I think I went from around 70gpd to 20 and began feeling like death so I knew I needed to taper. Ive now been maintaining no more than 30gpd for about 6 weeks now as I feel I have leveled out and arent experiencing any discomfort so Im wondering what on earth is going on because I havent made any further drops but yet ive been having this chest tightness pain for a few weeks. 

I can breathe fine and my blood pressure is always normal but im trying to figure out why my chest sometimes get tight, not daily but randomly but ive never felt this before and my doctor says its anxiety (without her being aware of the kratom) but ive had anxiety and panic attacks all my life and have never felt this tightness like this before. I even sometimes feel the tightness extending into my throat area. It feels like something is sitting on my chest and that i need air or im gasping for air but i am getting air just fine and i dont have any restrictions. It tends to last awhile and isnt instant, like it will hang around all day or start up in the afternoon and i'll have it when im getting to sleep. When i first started the taper i did notice one time i felt my heart fluttering which kinda scared me, kinda as if i had ran around or up a hill. 

Technically I am under a lot of stress as this has been one of the most or maybe THE most stressful times in my life that I have ever experienced (job loss, car accidents with lawsuits on top all in the last 6 months) and I am middled aged, so could it actually be stress and anxiety? Its just ive never experienced it feeling like this, or ive never had my anxiety to ever show up in my body as a physical pain. I just dont feel anxious around he time I feel the tightness, I mean I have run my entire life on anxiety so why this now, ya know? Whovh leads me to think its possibly due to the taper.  

Could a kratom taper cause chest tightness? Has anyone had this happen to them with a similar story?",5

\-The sensation of withdrawal is you being alive. Alive to breath another breath, to touch again, to smile again, to love again. Every. Single. Minute. You are closer to being alive again.

\-Acknowledge and understand the pain, because it means the blood in your veins flows clean. Your soul is making its way back into your heart.

\-La Joie De Vivre is within you. It's just buried. But you have a shovel, and you're digging. Trust that it's there.  She will smile at you when you find her.

I'm going into my senior year of college this year and I am really dreading facing my future without my habit. It was my comfort blanket. The thing that would make me happy no matter what I did. Wasn't any effort it was just take a couple pills and now I can take on what the world throws at me. How will I ever be normal. How can I ever face life without that smokescreen. Now I'm just sitting here thinking about all the fuckups I've made academically and fuck ups I've made impacting my future and my ability to someday be independent from my parents. How can I live with the guilt man. It just keeps boiling in my chest like a never ending pot of spaghetti. Pure feelings of existential dread for over 5 days now and it hasn't gotten a lick better. My spaghetti is all boiled and now it's getting mushy. Maybe eventually that spaghetti mush will  begin to boil and will solidify into a callous shell of starchy emotion that will protect me from the world. Maybe kratom was just blocking the flames from the pot and now the water just gotta boil until its all gone. 

Also I've been smoking weed and doing edibles but I can't even feel it??? What's up with this. Am I just replacing a habit with another or using it intelligently. Idk the only thing weed does for me rn is helps the anxiety a little bit and also makes my skeleton not feel like it's trying to escape my body. This definitely helps sleep no one likes a restless skeleton during slumber time",5

I have been having terrible thoughts: I'm 38 and was laid off 6 weeks ago. I have a good education, but no real prospects it feels like. I worked as a public accountant for some years, but hated that I was just helping rich people avoid taxes. I then moved to the nonprofit sector where I bust my ass for a while, but ultimately resigned from the charity I was working for. 

August 2019 I started my own business, but COVID messed a lot of stuff up. Since May of 2020 I've been flopping around, working half the time, whilst getting unemployment insurance for the rest of the time. I took a job in April 2021, and it led to kratom use: I was working 12+ hour days, 6-7 days a week in an industry I didn't fully understand. In May I started using kratom after work, which led to using it during working hours eventually. Then in mid June I was laid off, with no explanation given - just an apology and some bs words. After I was laid off I started using a lot more, with my gpd going from 20 to 40+. 

I try and remember what it was like before kratom took over my life. I know I wasn't depressed and didn't have severe anxiety. The past few weeks (on and off of K) I've felt so down and haven't done much with myself other than getting exercise. 

Thanks to all you read this. 

All the best to everyone on their own adventure!",10

this makes me really sad....why did I do this to myself? A handsome young 30yo man with a full head of hair that throws it away for....for what exactly? 

I hate taking showers now because when my hair is wet I can see right through my hair to my scalp depending on the angle and the way my hair is parted. I still have a bunch of hair, but it's like a forest whose trees are spread far apart and not dense - there's a lot of trees, but I can see right down the middle of them. 

When I wear headphones that compress my hair, it's even more noticeable. FUCK

current supplements I'm taking: iron, zinc, magnesium, theanine, tyrosine, and b12 occasionally. Will probably pick up fish oil here in the next few days.

I wonder what the chances are that I get out of this ""unscathed"" in the sense that my hair will grow back? I have noticed shedding, but it doesn't seem nearly as bad as the amount of shedding I've seen from people on here (and some of those have grown back).

What sucks is I'm finding all these kratom-related hairloss posts from 2-4yrs ago, and I'm trying to reach out to these people (the ones still active on Reddit) via chat to see if their hair has grown back but I haven't received any responses yet. Thats the tricky part - I see all the people posting about their fear about losing hair, but after they quit, they don't come back here to tell everyone whether their hair grew back or not. Not like they're supposed to....I just wish I had access to success stories.

Good news (maybe?) is that I don't really see my hairline receding so much as I just see my hair thinning and not being as thick. Someone made a comment on another forum related to kratom hairloss that that is a good sign in terms of hair growing back one day.",13

9 months ago I moved to a country that does not allow Kratom. I brought about 2 weeks worth with me.

I had been using it for 5+ years and got up to a daily dose of 15 caps x 4 times a day  (I only used capsules).

For the 6 weeks or so before I left, I dropped about 3-5 caps per dose, trying to get down to less frequent doses, to fewer caps, etc.

My worst withdrawal symptoms were insomnia and RCS. I call RCS ""restless CLENCH syndrome"" because that's what would happen. My entire torso would clench. I went 6 weeks without a good sleep. Now, part of this, too, was the enormity of my move, too. I had a therapist from the very beginning because I take psych meds, but no, I did not tell her about kratom. One thing I have found in this country is (just from chat boards) is NO ONE knows what kratom is. So I never talk about it.

I do miss it, yes, and my struggle is always what I will do when i return to my home country to visit. NGL, it'll be a struggle. But the insominia and RCS was so unbearable, i don't think I can do it again.

My biggest advice for you who are about to quit or try to is:

right now - keep an honest accounting of how much you are taking/using for a few days. don't make changes, but get a true picture of where you are, so you know where to go. then start a VERY slow taper. i can't tell you how much, I just did what i knew i could tolerate. if you can switch to capsules, it may be easier to control how much you're taking. I just couldn't stomach the taste/powder.

good luck. I wouldn't have stopped if I hadn't moved. I can admit that. so i probably had a great reason to stop.",7

I use to have beautiful thick long hair and it just stopped growing. It might have grown 3 inches in a year and a half and it was breaking off about 6inches from my scalp. It’s completely fucked up. I have no self confidence anymore. I don’t want to go out or see anyone. I have litterally cut everyone off. I jumped 8 days ago and the change is already drastic. My eyes are brighter and bluer. My skin has went from splotchy zombie look to clear and glowing again. My hair is still shedding the decrease is about 50percent. Now when I run my fingers through my hair a handful doesn’t come out. I’ve noticed 4 gray hairs that I never had! I just hope it comes back and comes back thick. I am so depressed about this but I have to start somewhere. I know it’s going to take a couple of years for me to get it back right I just hope it does come back!!!!! If anyone knows from experience please help me!!!!

I was able to think back on the prior day and remember all the little things that had escaped me due to brain fog. I could recall the name of that actress from that movie I liked. I remembered the title of that website I had once used to look up running plans. IT WAS SO WEIRD.

I remained in this state, partially wired, until I finally took a melatonin and passed back out a couple hours later.

When I woke up this morning, brain fog veil was back down, and I felt cloudy again. No enhanced memory. No word recall. Just… poof. Gone.

Even if it’s a bad day. I am thinking thought patterns I used to think prior to using Kratom. I’m starting to look in the mirror and slowly recognize myself again. PAWS is no joke, I feel really good right now but that can change tomorrow and I could come on here moping but I’m going to enjoy being happy right now in this moment. I am seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. For so long couldn’t see it, and tomorrow I might not see it as well but in this moment I do. I got back into singing and music - a passion I had lost. I even want to and have the sudden urge to join my college’s choir which is something I loved in high school. I’m listening to songs I sung in high school and crying tears of joy. I’m no longer afraid. I’m accepting the waves of anheondia (still probably not spelling that right but whatever), the crying episodes, I still have body aches every now and then, but they have gotten less frequent overtime. Right now in this moment I feel normal. I know that won’t last and I have to accept that. And I will. This is the hardest thing I’ve had to do (quitting) but the hardest thing is sometimes the best. This process is so slow and can be terrible at times, but there is beauty in healing. I feel much better than I did two weeks ago, even a week ago. My memory is sharp. Even prior to telling my mom two days ago, she had noticed a significant difference in me - like I had changed and seemed more like myself that she hadn’t seen in years. She said she saw it in my eyes, the way I talked, I no longer slur my words, just little things here and there. While I have ways to go, in this moment right now I feel content. And I know as the days go on, I’ll feel more and more of that. A few hours ago I had severe cravings and was convinced my brain was broken again and I’ll likely feel that tomorrow. But I am choosing right now to focus on the positive. The battle is worth fighting. You have to work at it, it can get exhausting… but as many people here have said who are further along than me in recovery - what’s a few months of not feeling “ok” when you have your whole life ahead? I will continue this fight and like I said - I never lose. Keep fighting folks.",62

I relapsed recently, I took kratom over 10 days, around 7 days, I was taking around 2-2.5 grams twice a day.

Yesterday I took 3 grams in the morning, then a couple hours later started developing anxiety and weird pains all over my body.

However then it developed into a very heavy pain in my chest that would grow in intensity over around 10 seconds and then die off, these would come in waves.

I eventually decided I needed to go to the hospital, I could feel my heart beating when the pain was kicking in and it felt like my heart was spasming.

What followed was around 3 hours of my heart staying above 140 and these pains coming and going, I thought I was toast, and I it made me realise I'm not scared of death, I'm scared of fear and anxiety, because I would have ended it all right there and then if there was an eject button.

I've just woken up the day after and as usual my body feels weird, like it usually does after a bad anxiety attack, my adrenals are probably f\*\*ked.

I managed to get some diazepam from the hospital and they gave me a prescription for some beta blockers which I'm going to collect today.

I relapsed the kratom because I went out drinking some days before and took cocaine, then I repeated that the week after, I've had this problem before so I was afraid of falling back into that routine, and I don't seem to have a normal brain that can say no, it's like my defences are not strong enough, and the impulse to do it keeps trying and trying until eventually it finds a gap in my defences.

Last time I stopped doing drink and coke it was kratom that helped me.

But after yesterday, which I hope I never forget the terror and humiliation of it all, I won't be doing any drugs again.

Although I'm now going to be seeing my doctor about getting some beta blockers for the anxiety and thinking about something for the depression also, although I've always been hesitant to do anti-depression drugs because I've seen what some of them do to people.

But yeah, kratom feels like a demon which took me to hell and back yesterday.",7

What has helped me the most so far -,"Here are a list of things that have helped me so much in the last week. This is my second time quitting and this time around it has been SO MUCH EASIER. The first time was 2 months of hell. This time around is much more manageable. Obviously all of our lives and bodies are different so don’t take this as a perfect protocol for everyone, but I truly hope it helps all of you. 

- I tapered down to half of my normal daily dosage over the course of about 4 months. I tried to taper more but I just couldn’t seem to get below 10gpd. 
- I requested 2 weeks off for a “staycation” so the stress of work, responsibilities, and waking up early are not an issue for me right now. 
- I told my girlfriend, my housemate/friend, and a couple close friends who have all been very supportive so I don’t feel alone. It also just feels good to get the skeletons out of the closet. 
- Staying active! I’m already a very active person so maintaining those habits have helped so much. Calisthenics, surfing, stretching, and mountain biking are where I get the blood pumping and the endorphins flowing. Even just 20 mins to get the sweat going was very helpful for my mood. 
-protein powder with cbd
- cbd tincture
- 10mg cbd/5mg thc gummies helped the first five days. 
- heating pad
- percussion massager for rls
- icy hot for rls
- sauna
- hot shower to cold shower
- cold dips in the ocean
- positive mental attitude 
- and meditation is very beneficial! Particularly the Letting Go Technique via David Hawkins

Hope this helps my brothers and sisters on their journey! The light shines bright at the end of the tunnel! 👊

If you’re in such a rough spot that a lot of this seems very difficult in the acutes, I would recommend the cbd, heat and meditation over all else.",10
