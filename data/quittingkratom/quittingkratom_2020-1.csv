I am on day 7 of a slow taper down from an average of 30GPD down to 10 GPD. My initial plan was a very slow taper but at this point, I feel like I can perhaps speed it up. I felt like death on day 4, but day 5 and 6 have been amazing. I finally started to feel like my self. I finally started to feel happy. Don’t know how much of it is placebo. But friends, it DOES GET BETTER. I’m still taking 10 GPD (5 in the morning, 5 at night) and already noticing a difference. I think once I got 2 or 3 more days on 10 GPD i will taper one gram at a time since then. Today hasn’t been great day as far as withdrawals but I’m so hopeful for the next few days. Thank you all for the support. Could not have done it without all of you.",2,0

This time I had help and stuck to a slow taper and I had zero issues. It really does work. You shouldn’t have to put your body into shock to get of Kratom. I’m literally going down a half gram every dose and I finished and I have had zero withdrawals.  I never thought it would work but it did after 6 years of trying to get off this shit. Let me know if you need help and message me. I’m surprised it really worked. Don’t put yourself through hell only to relapse. It does take discipline but you can do it! Message me if needed. Good luck!,14,0

For the last two years I have had easy access to weed, alcohol, mdma, adderall, xans, lsd, etc. I was high on something daily. After ruining several relationships because of my drug abuse and failing to go to college, I finally sobered up in September.

Lonely and depressed after having to face sobriety, I found kratom and for the last few months it has helped me significantly. Over time my occasional dose became daily. 5gpd became 10gpd. 1x day turned to 3x. But it was the only thing I looked forward to.

I enjoy kratom and never faced real consequences but someone responded to one of my posts last week saying ""you're dealing with a potential lifelong addiction"" and that hit me. I'm done with this stuff. I used to laugh more, I used to have friends. No matter how shitty circumstances are they're not an excuse to use.

I just can't quit (~10 gpd),"I'm angry because I already had to quit heroin. It was fucking hell, even with kratom. I thought I would eventually get tired of kratom and stop taking it. Nope. I'm mad because I feel like I have to start all over. Kratom has ruined my life. I'm also scared because it feels like I'm fucking up my body in adverse ways.

I have 10 months of ""clean"" time that's not really even clean time. I'm still a junkie. It's just as hard to quit. I don't know what it is but I can't even get through a day.

Kratom just keeps the withdrawals at bay. That's literally it. At this point, I feel fucking NOTHING from it, and if I take more I just feel like garbage (hot flashes, nausea, dizziness). However, if I stop I feel even WORSE, which I didn't think would be possible. A lot worse. I'm already severely fucking depressed on it. How bad can it get without it?

I just don't want to go through this fucking bullshit again. It was hell the first time. This shit is the same fucking thing. Fuck this.

I guess I underestimated how bad heroin withdrawal is, which in turn made me underestimate kratom. I assumed because I was having such a hard time quitting dope, while still taking 15 gpd of green shit (with no tolerance), that kratom was ""not that powerful"" or ""not a big deal"". Well now that I've had ample time to get over h, I feel that jumping off from k is going to be equally as strenuous.

My side effects from quitting are extreme restless leg, shortness of breath, sweating and heat flashes, tingling in my feet and legs. 
I'm too scared to go to the hospital as I'm pretty sure they will just yank me off cold turkey and let me suffer a few days as hospitals aren't trained to do kratom withdrawal. 
So now I'm stuck on kratom like an average drug addict and have to take it everywhere. 
So I'm gonna try tapering and need some pointers. What herbs or meds can make withdrawals less rough?

It’s my fault I relapsed, but blame it for symptoms I thought were coming from kratom withdrawals. I had horrible insomnia from taking kava. I didn’t figure it out till I dosed kratom and kava and still had insomnia. I started going to the kava bar and mixing my own kava with an aluball at the start of my quit. I thought I was cheating the system, little did I know I was making it harder on myself. Day 13 I was struggling to make it through the day. I’ve been sleeping 2-3 hrs every night since my quit. I went and bought an extract kratom shot on my lunch break and it definitely helped. My job is very demanding and can’t just go home or take days off. I have to be on my game. After I got off went and drank kava. Didn’t sleep any that night despite taking kratom. Same for the next 2 days. Finally was like screw it, not drinking kava today or tonight. Slept very good that night. Next 2 days drank kava and didn’t sleep again. So I didn’t drink the last few nights and an sleeping great.

IV heroin user for 10+ years, among many other substances I used recreationally. 3 years ago I attempted suicide by shooting myself in the chest. I did not die (obviously) as the gun kicked it slid and I shot myself in the upper/right part of my chest and it blew out my shoulder completely. I have been to half a dozen different ortho surgeons and everybody says they can’t help my. I have very limited use of my right arm and I am in severe chronic pain. But because of that I got into recovery and even started working in the field as a public speaker & marketer for a treatment facility. I started getting a lot of recognition and the money soon followed. Everyone wanted the poster boy of recovery to come work for them. I started working 60-70 hours a week. 7 days a week. 365. And the chronic pain became too much for me to hear. I was so scared of going back to opiates i decided to try Kratom. And what a wonder drug it was for me! It didn’t fuck me up. It took away all the pain. Gave me even more energy. But over a period of months my tolerance built up. I needed to take it first thing in the morning and dose several times a day. Now I am completely addicted to this shit  after beating a heroin addiction, surviving a suicide attempt, and building a nice career for myself-I’m back addicted again!! So I told myself, well at least I’m not shooting crack and heroin anymore...it’s okay if I’m addicted. The side effects aren’t that bad. Well all of a sudden I’ve devolved this horrible case of tinnitus and after searching the web I’ve seen other people complain of the same symptoms. I’m so fucking upset because I can’t sleep or focus or do absolutely anything because it sounds like a grenade went off next to my head. So now I’m stressed like, wtf do I do? Am I damned to go through life suffering from a “8” on the pain scale every fucking day? This sucks but I know now I have to quit Kratom because I can’t deal with this tinnitus. I’m not even sure why I’m posting this. Maybe because everyone thinks I’m some recovery god and I’m too afraid to reach out to anyone for help. I’m afraid I’ll loose my career. Anyway. wish me luck. I think I’m gonna try tapering. I’ve seen lots of different formulas for doing this but any advice or support at all would be appreciated. And any tips on dealing with this tinnitus would be helpful.

I started off doing coke daily for abouts 6 months then I quit and started using Kratom for a few months. I initially started using it as in order to get rid of the come down affects but it was working too well. Eventually I started doing tons of other oppiates like hydrocodone, oxycotin, percosets, methadone and a bunch of other shit every day for, I don't know to be honest but it was over a year. I would switch with kratom and other oppiates. I eventually stopped the other opiates all together because I knew that I needed to slow down. I thought Kratom was pretty light but eventually got caught up on it. Now for the past 3 years I've been on Kratom everyday, my tolerance grew quickly, my peak was around 70 or 80 grams daily. 

I'm in the paws phase right now and the anhedonia is completely crippling. its been about 3 months since I went cold turkey but I still don't feel anything. I use to go out and enjoy drinking with friends on the weekends or playing videogames or watching anime or even jerking off but now I don't even feel anything and its pretty devastating. I've been trying to take tons of supplements, L-Tyrosine, Mucuna Pruriens, HTP5, L-Arginine, GABA and Shrooms but nothings really helping. I know its my own fault but it still sucks.

It was always a secret. But every date every road trip every *everything* was tinged with Kratom. What the fuck, looking back. What the fuck. 

Day 15 off and I’m feeling strange about it all. Like I don’t know if I want to be in this relationship. It’s so foreign to me sober. I’m just a little disillusioned. 

I used Kratom to mask any and all problems. Maybe I’m just scared of dealing with them sober. But maybe one of my problems was wanting to be single and avoiding that to avoid conflict. I feel really messed up in the head. 

Maybe I’m still in the thick of it and it’s no time to make big decisions. Probably not. But it makes me want to cry. Thinking of going to a therapist. Resolve these things in a healthier way. 

I wish I never introduced a drug into my development and let it sink it’s teeth into my brain processes, my habits, my decision making process. Biggest mistake I’ve made in the last 5 years.

25,2020-01-29 14:53:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/evs43t/here_we_go_again/,Here we go again...,"I need to write this out somewhere and I have no one to talk to about it at the moment so I'm putting it here. I just made a new account because I was having trouble getting into my old one, but I have been watching this community on and off since I started trying to quit, about four years ago (my addiction is now five years old). Kind of crazy that I've been trying to quit for most of the time I've been using. Even more crazy is how this community has grown. It had about 1k members when I first joined. That slowly crept up and then started to explode the past year or two it seems. Doesn't surprise me at all with how widespread kratom has become--in gas stations, headshops, in kratom-specific shops and herb shops, in the news.

I've quit so many times, but this past year contained my most successful attempt(s). I quit for about three months (july-october) and with all my other quits combined, I'd say I was only taking kratom daily for a bit less than 2/3 of the year. So as terrifying and disconcerting as this addiction is, I try to keep that in mind and tell myself everyone's recovery trajectory is different and I'm headed in the right direction. Right? Ugh.

Anyway, I'm preparing now for another quit. This one is going to be really hard for a few reasons. I find my easiest quits are when I'm active and busy, even though the quit sounds terrifying if you have physical shit you must do during the day. Warm weather/summer quits are easier as well. But right now, it's winter. I'm unemployed (I work seasonally and have a job lined up for April) so my days are very unstructured and I need to be disciplined enough to go out and do shit. 

I also am having some really horrible and anxiety-inducing relationship problems which I don't feel like I can properly deal with until I'm sober. Kratom turns me into a crazy and emotionally irrational person, so it's hard for me to distinguish between what I should actually be upset about and needs to be talked about and what is actually not a big deal at all. Kratom makes me ruminate, dwell on certain thoughts and spiral hopelessly into them. Not exactly a recipe for a healthy, stable relationship. My significant other also thinks I quit for good last year--I never told him I started back up again and have done my best to keep my dosing hidden (who knows, maybe he's not as oblivious as I think he is). It sucks because 1) it's really hard to go through this alone with no one to talk about it with and 2) it's tricky to hide withdrawal symptoms when you sleep in the same bed with someone.

I also have been abusing adderall and phenibut as of late. Yeah, adderall, phenibut, kratom, a real fun little speedball of legal bullshit. God I hate myself. I abuse adderall in a really unique way, it's pretty much like meth to me, not sure what it is about my brain that makes me compulsively redose and take amounts that have probably damaged my heart. So I put that down, obviously, all I can say is I hope all the sleep deprivation from that will help me sleep when I quit kratom. I didn't abuse phenibut quite as badly as some of the horror stories I've read, and I'm on my second day without and am feeling alright. I told myself I would wait a few days to let the post-phenibut sadness/anxiety drift away before I tackle the kratom. So I'll be starting my quit within the next day or two.

It's now or never. I've been laying in bed unable to sleep, thinking about damage I may have done to my brain, googling neuroplasticity, drowning in fear that I wasted the best years of my life, wondering where I would be and what I would have accomplished had I not let this substance into my life, which I feel has dulled my mental abilities and stunted my creativity. I know those aren't super useful thoughts, and I try to convince myself of the brain's healing abilities, and I try to remind myself of all the things addiction teaches you and the unique things I have gotten out of this process, as painful as it has been. I try to remind myself I still have a lot of life left to accomplish things. 

So here we go, again. I have a cabinet full of supplements from former quits--I really feel the most important things for me are the vitamins (multi, B, D, emergen-C), fish oil, amino acids, and magnesium. Hot epsom salt baths. I have some gabapentin and CBD for sleep and anxiety. Water, healthy food, and exercise are ESSENTIAL tools. And I think this quit I really need to try to work some yoga and/or meditation into my days, which I've never successfully done before. That stuff could really help given the way my mind has been operating lately. I quit about a month ago for 8 days and it wasn't that bad in terms of physical symptoms for some reason. Let's hope it's similar this time around. 

Whew, that was a novel, but it felt good to get it out somewhere! Wish me luck, I'll hopefully be checking back in here. I just keep remembering day 40 of my three-month quit, and how I felt so good and couldn't believe it--I felt good without the help of any substance. I finally understood that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and I could reach it. But goddamn that tunnel is dark as hell!",18,0

...where I'm getting at is, as an addict, there's a underlying cause. Kratom isn't my problem. Back to being realistic...Ive done all the usual traditional ways of recovery. 12 steps, church, ect. I've dedicated a decade of my life to aa, it just doesn't stick! It's like when a 12 stepper says religion doesn't work for them.

I know I have to quit, I've done it countless amount of times, but this mentality has made me relapse many many times, to the point where I  know this mindgame needs to stop, otherwise when I jump off, it'll be pointless?

I regret that. Now, I cannot sleep because my RLS has spread to other parts of my body. It is only day 5 and I feel like a fiend. I am smoking cannabis like never before. I have chronic fatigue due to Ehlers Danlos syndrome, but this fatigue after stopping cold turkey is unreal. I do not know how I am even managing to get out of the bed into the other room to write this. I will thank the coffee and black seed oil for that.

I paid for Kratom via echeck and am checking my order update every few minutes so I can see my new bag is on its way. I have never let my kratom intake be out of control until the last few months. Before, I did not have it everyday and if I did it was once a day and a small dose. The last few months it has been 3 doses a day. Those doses were more than double the amount that I used to take.

I have been addicted to several harmful drugs in the past from DXM to fay (K2 I think is the common name), to meth, to heroin... I have never felt like this. Maybe it is because I am getting older and my actions are catching up with my body.

Your doses get smaller, and caps become more economical.  It's still more expensive than bulk powder, but when you're spending less $ on kratom, caps aren't a dealbreaker.  If you decide to use caps to taper, maybe you'll notice some extra benefits to the cost:

1. The caps are easy to count.  Almost every kratom dealer sells them in 0.5gram doses per cap.  You know exactly how much you are taking and when, particularly if you're aware of the % potency of the kratom strain.  Taper schedules can get pretty precise, and caps make it easy to execute.

2. The caps keep you accountable. With the scoop, and particularly without a scale, it's very easy to ""accidentally"" pour too much kratom, or treat yourself and cheat yourself.  When your doses get small, those ""oopsies"" as a percentage of what you ingest per day can really add up and throw you off your game. Caps help to remove that potential for temptation and maintain a consistent glide path.

3. The caps introduce a new habit into your routine.  Whatever your old ritual was, this isn't it.  A new procedure, or method of administration will help you break free of your old habit.  My ritual involved dumping kratom into my morning, mid-day, and late afternoon cups of coffee.  But now it's different: my coffee is unadulterated (and I had forgotten what normal coffee tastes like). I break open a cap, dump it in my mouth, and chase it with warm water.  In this way, it feels more medicinal than recreational, and has really changed my relationship with kratom, which makes it easier to quit.

4. The caps are more socially acceptable.  Even though kratom is legal in most jurisdictions, some people still find it prudent to keep things discrete.  Bulk powder looks weird.  Most of us have it and use it.  I scoop directly from the bag-- we all do. When I keep kratom at work, these bags are sitting in my desk.  If a coworker had to rifle through my drawers for something, they might wonder what the hell this is about.  ON THE OTHER HAND, if they saw some professionally packaged supplement caps, particularly if it's next to vitamins and ibuprofen, it looks a lot less sketch.  Keeping caps in my drawer instead of gaudy bulk supplement bags, have brought some of my stress levels down.

5. It's not as expensive as you might think.  If you were doing 10, 20+ grams per day before, capsules were not very economical. But once your body is used to lower doses, you can spend the same amount of money-- or even less than you did at your peak, and break free from your old ritual without breaking your wallet.  If caps are 3x as expensive per dose as bulk powder, then if you reduce your normal dose by 1/3rd, you break even.  

Edit: kratom capsules are meant to be opened up and ingested.  If you swallow them whole, they're dissolving in your intestines and you wont get the goodies.  You can also mess up your intestines.",2,0

I’ve struggled with this substance since November 2018. I’ve “tried” quitting before but it’s only lasted half days. I tried tapering but convinced myself each time to do *just a little more* and quickly ended up doing a reverse taper.


I have to stop. I want to, badly. I have many reasons to stop. I just never can. I don’t have any leave time left as I got the flu at the beginning of the year. 


I work three jobs, all mentally and emotionally taxing and I don’t want to withdraw and not be able to actually do the things required of me. I work with people and it’s not fair for them to get a dopesick version of me when they need life or death help. 


I’m using about 10-16 grams per day. I thought about doing a taper with capsules and only taking what I need for the day to work with me. I am a 120lb female, in excellent shape. I eat well and I am active. I do yoga, strength train and run. But I still have this crutch.

I didn't realize just how much kratom was inhibiting my enjoyment of music. I've always been a massive audiophile, I have like 10 pairs of headphones of various quality ranges, driver technologies, sound signatures, etc (the first addiction...). It's like hearing them all again for the first time even after genuinely enjoying the sound of them while on kratom. If I had to estimate, I'd say music sounds at least 25-33% better sober.

So, I made a post a couple days ago where I said I was having horrible insomnia and hypnic jerks and could only get like an hour of sleep at night or so. Turns out, it's actually been like 4 years since I discovered kratom. Somehow I didn't realize it had been that long. I thought it was just like 2.5-3 years. I used kratom pretty responsibly on and off over that time period. Was sober most of the time.

Where it went wrong is the last year and a half, and that was 18-25gpd. Had to stop because my tolerance suddenly started rapidly going up all of the sudden after being consistent for all that time. Plus, I was having some pretty severe intestinal issues and knew if I continued putting empty calorie kratom capsules in my stomach I'd end up in the ER.

Anyway, guess that explains why my insomnia will probably last a lot longer than most people. Also decided on a whim to just quit nicotine and embrace my inner insomniac since it wasn't helping me anyways a couple days ago. Now I'm 100% sober from everything that's not a supplement or something like CBD. Taking CBD 25mg capsules to keep me calm, taking lots of probiotics, magnesium capsules, etc. And just got some black seed oil. Praying to God that I'll get some good sleep tonight with this stuff. Tired of getting an hour of sleep per night. I'm going to stick through this though, trust me! And I can't imagine ever relapsing. I wouldn't want to put myself through this ever again. Sure, I'm at day 8, but it feels like I'm at day 16 since I've been awake almost the entire time.

Stay quit! Just trust me! It's so worth it. It's so beautiful to be feeling emotions again. It all feels so clear. Sure, most things still suck but I'm noticing things start to get a tiny bit better day by day. Ironically, it feels totally worth it for most things to suck right now since on the other hand I'm feeling beautiful emotions and experiencing things I haven't felt in a very long time now.",10,0

Long story short, I switched to Kratom from opioids because I thought it was a non-addictive, and safer alternative. Well, about 2 years later, it’s gotten a little out of hand. With my addictive personality, it makes it extremely hard to quit and or taper, but I need to desperately. 
Here’s my issue. I’m spending money I don’t have on Kratom, and I’m worried the amount of capsules I’m taking is damaging my system. On top of that, I just want to live my life without being reliable on an outside source to bring me relief/happiness. 
Here’s my other issue. I’m in my young twenty’s, and I work full time while going to school full time. Kratom helps/stops my anxiety, helps me sleep, and gives me the energy to keep going. I need to quit, and have tried more times than I can count. I do not have the will power to taper, and I also don’t have the opportunity to lock myself inside to wait out the withdrawals because of school and work. I’m taking enough to where I’ve experienced deep withdrawal.

I never believed I would still be feeling it's effects 12 days after last taking it.  But there it is.  My body still tingles, I am still lethargic, and my sleep is still interrupted.  

The sleep has improved a little.  I am waking up every 2 to 3 hours instead of every 1 to 2 hours.  I have also been going to bed 2 hours early every night to try to get my normal amount of sleep.  However, no matter how much sleep I actually get, I am still pretty tired and slow all day.  It really hits in the afternoon.  

From reading on here, the recovery process seems to vary person to person.  For some, it is two steps forward, one step back.  For me, it has been very straight forward.  I would say I improve 5% to 10% every day.  I remember in the first couple of days, I was counting the hours.  Day 5 seemed ages off and like a huge accomplishment.  At day 12, the time is going by a little faster and the time is much more bearable.  However, it still seems weird that I am not there yet.  

I am lucky in a lot of ways.  I really don't have time to think too much about it or be depressed.  Never really have been.  My work is extremely busy, and I have been keeping up with it.  I have cooked about 90% of my meals since the jump and am making sure to eat good healthy food.  I have been taking a ton of vitamins.  I have been going to bed early every night.  I have been saying the Rosary every day, except the first couple when I was out of it.  Church and sports (my own and kids) has kept me busy on weekends.  I have been to the gym every other day.  I am already in good physical shape.  I am hoping all this leads to a speedy recovery.   

One last note.  I am so happy I just jumped instead of continued with the taper.  Anyone who is currently tapering and thinking of ripping off the band-aid, DO IT!  It has eased my stress about quitting and speed up the process by months.  Good luck and God bless.",12,0

Let’s just say my first month off kratom was wild. I figured I should share my story on here, even though I’m sure it’s not your average withdrawal story.

So, I have not touched kratom since November 30. On December 24, Christmas Eve, I started feeling a weird pain in my ribcage. It got really bad. I ignored it since I had church, a date and night out with my SO, then more fam time. I was still on suboxone and my taper ended Christmas Day. By the 27th, the pain got unbearable. I didn’t know what it was, so I went to the ER.

It turns out I had a broken rib, 9th rib on the left side to be exact. Obviously they can’t case it, so the main goal was pain management. So they prescribed me 18 5-mg oxycodone. Picked up my prescription after tousling with the pharmacist at Walgreens for ages. “Why are you taking oxy after suboxone?” basically. Uggghh I wish I toughed it out.

Well, it turns out the suboxone was still in my system. I took one oxy. Two, three. By midnight, I had taken 14. Given I had been prescribed 10-mg for back surgery and did up to 5 opms shots a day, I felt nothing from a 5-mg dose. I also felt incredibly naus and couldn’t sleep, so I took 4 phenergens (a nausea med that makes you extremely sleepy).

The next morning, I was a mess. I couldn’t communicate clearly, and my texts were incoherant. My parents for forced me to go to the ER since I took so much medicine, and the doctor was a dick and baker acted me (in Florida, that means involuntary placement in a psych ward for up to 72 hours). The doctor also lied and said I abused benzos. (That I hadn’t done - my issue was opiates and not understanding the suboxone was still in my body).

When you are Baker acted, an ambulance must take you to a pysch ward. Ironically, I was taken to the same hospital where I was born. I fought staying there overnight like nothing else. My parents turned on me (mainly my dad - he lied to the ER doc that I had made a suicide attempt when I hadn’t...my tolerance to opioids was just crazy high). 

The inpatient psych floor felt like imprisonment. I was kicking and screaming so much they gave me a shot of B52- 5 mg haldol, 50 mg benadryl, and 2 mg ativan. It made me high as a kite then tired, and I fell asleep in my newly assigned room and slept for 14 hours. 

When I woke up, I realized I was in rehab with a bunch of suicidal people around my age. No judgment on suicidal people, but I knew I didn’t belong. I barely ate those next 40 hours, as the food was completely gross as someone who follows a gluten-free, low fat, and red meat-free diet. I met with multiple doctors. and within 40 hours a psych decided I could go home, as I was no danger to myself and others.

I went home on December 30. Since then, all I’ve done is taken my gabapentin for pain and benzo withdrawal as prescribed and had the occasional alcoholic beverage. The worst thing that happened to me was 6 nights of no sleep last week.

I decided to spend the past weekend with my SO, and we vaped a lot of weed. I slept like a baby, like 9-10 hours a night. Now that I’m back home, I can’t do weed, but I’ve snuck in some CBD that has helped me relax.

Honestly I’m a little scared rn. I’m thrilled to wake up and not need to dose kratom. But I’m afraid benzo withdrawal will return once I finish gabapenton. I refuse to see the psych I saw twice again, as she thought 3 15-mg oxazepam would end benzo withdrawal, and she said my running was an addiction that needs to stop. Seriously F$&! that. Running gives me endorphins that make drugs unnecessary. She also tried to prescribe me seroquil for sleep only (I
NOT psychotic she said). That gave me the scariest hallucinations in the world. No wonder she only has 1.7 out of 5 stars on healthgrade.

I see a new psych, who happens to be the best of my city, on February 13. Only he can override the ER doc’s ban on all controlled substances (I NEVER abused xanax but my doctor is prohibited from prescribing though he wants to.

So tl;dr - If you are on a suboxone taper, don’t break a bone and fill an rx for oxy or you may take too many to feel relief and someone may think you are making a suicide attempt when you most definitely aren’t. Kratom withdrawal is crazy. Wishing you all a smoother ride.",1,0

I've always loved water my whole life and would say I averaged about a gallon a day before starting kratom. Then on kratom I was drinking even more, since I was chugging a 16.9 oz bottle every 2 hours with my toss-n-wash. I quit 49 days ago and have found it difficult to drink water ever since. I don't find water as satisfying or fulfilling as I used to and I always think I'm hungry and don't realize when it's actually dehydration. In the past, I never had a problem differentiating between hunger and thirst. I  wonder if the associarion between taking kratom and chugging water has conditioned me to dislike drinking water on it's own.

I tried to quit twice before: first, by tapering; and second, using suboxone for 2 weeks. Both attempts failed and I ended back on the kratom at 100g/day.

This time I have quit CT but have used vyvanse during the day and klonopin at night during my entire CT period. I also use alcohol, medical cannabis, flexeril, and gabapentin as needed at nighttime only (not all of them at once but more of a rotation day by day) with the klonopin. I have had zero withdrawal effects besides diarrhea. It has been amazing so far and I feel 100% better than when on the K.

I think it’s important to add that I was not taking the vyvanse, klonopin, or any of the other meds I mentioned prior to my CT. So, I was only dependent on kratom at the start of this 8 days ago. All meds I got via prescription. Naturally, my concern is that I don’t want to pick up a klonopin habit and I’m not sure how I’ll feel when I stop taking them soon (I have 6 left and take 2mg per night).

My co worker who introduced me had just went threw 2 pregnancys back to back and said it helped tremendously with postpartum issues. I was done breastfeeding and my co worker was going threw the exact issues as me without problem so I was all in. It worked wonders. No more depression, energy to take care of my newborn. I could sleep. I wanted to get out of the house again. This went on for about 10 months. Slowly but surely this plant started to turn on me. It didn’t give me the same energy. I started becoming depressed. Empty. Numb. Felt stupid. My hair is falling out. I’ve realized how much I’ve been slacking as a mother. I’m a good mom but I know I’m not the mom I have the potential to be. I love my son more than anything in the world..but it’s like I don’t FEEL the love for my son that I know I have. I know that sounds horrible and doesn’t make sense but to another kratom user it does...that disconnect you’re not even aware of. And my marriage...let’s not even get into that. 
 
My son is now a year and a half and the last couple months I’m up to 20-25 gpd. I’ve been on a taper for the last 12 days and am currently down to 6 gpd. I have body aches if I go more than 4-5 hours without a dose. Ive had a mild headache since I started tapering. Super irritable. I’ve suffered with depression for years so I’m worried how that will go once I jump. And of course theres the fear of relapsing. I’ve never been addicted to anything like this before. I turn 30 this weekend so I’m gifting myself my life back and jumping than.

Hello everyone. I've been lurking this sub for over a year now. To give some backstory, my partner has been on kratom every day since I met him.  When I first met him, he was barely taking any. Only as needed for anxiety. The first few years of our relationship was amazing. He was sweet, kind, funny. He had ambitions, goals, dreams.  I was so in love. He wanted to be with me, so I moved in with him.

After I moved in with him into our apartment, he started a physically demanding job that required him to work 6x a week, 10-12 hour days, for years.  It was taxing, and he obtained some health problems along the way (mostly mental but also joint pain and inability to sleep, muscle pain etc).

He began to take more kratom.  As I write this, he is on 40-50g per day. He became... different. He was more emotionless than ever before. He stopped putting any emotional care into our relationship, became a zombie, one that hated his life and talked about how horrible everything was every day. If I messed something up, he'd call me on the phone to yell at me. He began to call me horrible names. It got so bad at one point, he even broke a radio and a nice picture frame, plus tossed some other valuables around when he was super upset... He cussed out his mother over the phone, things he believed about her- none of those things being true.  I would take care of him when he was sick, but when I got sick, I wasn't taken care of. One time I was struggling with a horrible stomach bug and he yelled at me because I couldn't remember where his kratom bag was.

All this while sometimes, during some miracle moments of clarity, these small, fleeting moments, I would see a glimpse of the person I used to love. We would plan concerts, play videogames and have deep conversations I felt we hadnt had in a long time.  Would hug me, give me kisses like he used to. These were the moments that made me stay- this hope that things would get better. And even sometimes, he would break down crying, telling me he knew he had changed, knew he was awful to be around, wanted to change, was depressed and in pain all the time, anxious. These moments were rare, but I do want to note that they did happen.

This month he finally changed jobs and now gets 2 days off every week and gets off at a reasonable time. His joint pain and insomnia started to get a bit better. He was happy about 80% of the time now, so I thought it was the change of pace that he really needed, and that everything was going to be better now.  But then, after an angry outburst (over something small) made him break yet another thing, and he started calling me awful names again, my hopes started to fall apart. I had forgotten about the kratom. He was still taking 40-50g a day, and had admitted to me he was also drinking behind my back, going to bars when I didn't know, sneaking the stuff in whenever he could.  I started doing my research, and sure enough... kratom can induce an opiod-like rage during withdrawals. Kratom can change your personality. Kratom can ruin your relationships.  I asked him, if he could do this for me, try to quit, if I made a taper-to-zero plan for him would he stick to it? He said he would try. God I hope he does.

Please QuittingKratom, give me a bit of hope. I love him so much, but I do not love who he became. Does any of this sound familiar to you? Is it possible to turn into a completely different person because of this substance? To turn into such a terrible person so quickly? He's tried to quit twice but relapsed both times, and the longer he's on this stuff the worse he's getting. Has kratom ruined relationships for you? Do I need to help him, stick with him through it all, help him quit, be his support group, or is this much more than just the drug abuse? I want to keep hoping he can be the loving, emotional and amazing person he used to be... Any advice would be appreciated...

TL;DR : Boyfriend went from the best thing I've ever had in my life to a depressed, angry, emotionless bully. I need to know if there's any hope. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to go through but I don't want to give up on him.",32,0

Just before christmas I decided to try tapering as CT was not an option for me as my WD are impossible for me to handle. I once went 6 days CT and had approx 4 hrs sleep and the RLS was so intense as well as the lack of sleep, in the end I ordered more with the intention of tapering but that never worked and before long I was using heavy again.

Anyway im down to around 10gpd and the issue im having is the constant fatigue and having No energy at all.

Coming off a 50gpd 1.5 year habit.  Last dose ended up being just before 3pm Friday (instead of Friday morning as intended) to keep me going for a bit of an emergency at work.  Now it is Monday morning after a weekend of detoxing. Hadn't really planned on stopping kratom, but will be traveling internationally for work all this week so made the smart decision to not try my hand at smuggling nor risk withdrawing at 35,000 ft.

First 36h (Fri evening through Saturday late night) were the worst in terms of RLS, diaphoresis, hot/cold flashes, insomnia, etc.  After yet another scalding hot shower I managed to doze off late Saturday night and woke up feeling a lot better early Sunday.  Forced myself to get some chores done during the day, and with the help of some melatonin (RLS had abated by then) got a full 8h Sunday night.

Still a little low energy and overly emotional (though I also just finished reading a huge fantasy series which always leaves me down in the dumps) but I feel in pretty good shape physically.  Will carry some loperamide with me just in case loose stool persists and is too inconvenient to handle naturally.

Honestly I am just so grateful I managed to not leave it too late.  I can so easily see myself waking up this morning, after having given in and used all weekend, to make some terrible decisions with potentially life altering consequences.

My reason for posting is to encourage others to follow through on plans to get clean when they can set some time aside to do so in a reasonable manner prior to being forced off under unfavorable circumstances.  It wasn't a cake-walk, and I've definitely read some stories where a weekend was by no means enough time to get through acute withdrawal, but it was fortunately just enough for me to be positioned to succeed this week.

Stay strong and before you know it the hours will have slipped by.

edit 1: coming up on 72h now.
Breakfast unfortunately went right through me (hadn't had any gi problems during the weekend but I probably was only consuming water and tea so that might explain that).  Popped a single loperamide before leaving for the airport and it turned off the faucet.  On the plane about to land now and I'd say zero physical complaints throughout other than a bit more tired than usual.  Biggest issue so far is how much harder it is to zone out when working on documentation/presentations.  I feel like taking a break after every change instead of mindlessly plowing through.  Had a chance to actually do some problem solving though and for a while I completely forgot I wasn't on kratom which was nice.  Hoping to get some grub after landing and seeing how it sits.  Take care!",19,0

Mostly I only experience the fx of WDs in the morning/when I wake up and start my day. I usually take the last dose close to bed, right before brushing my teeth. Generally I sleep anywhere 6-10 hrs. (working on regulation).  

So I awake feeling hot and cold, sensitive ""tingly"" skin all over, watery eyes, cough, runny nose, sneezing, etc. And of course, mild anxiety and the desire (need) to redose. 

I'm also asking bc I recently read somewhere that ""symptoms of kratom withdrawal typically appear for most people within 12-48 hours of the last dose."" And that's confusing and concerning to me  because it does not take that long at all IME. I think my symptoms appear within 3-4 hours, with mental cravings usually even sooner. 

This also worries me because now I'm thinking that going through the whole withdrawal process will be so much worse, that I've only experienced a small tiny taste of the pain that's in store.

I've been a lurker here for quite some time now and finally decided to share my progress, hopefully inspiring others. For the last two years I had been using kratom 3-5 times a day to cope with crippling social anxiety and depression. This seemed to work for the first month or two, but as my tolerance quickly rose so did my dose along with side effects. I lost all ambitions, motivation, feelings, and even love. The second a dose would start wearing off, everything I was using kratom to hide from would come flooding back with much more intensity than before my use. I tore up relationships with friends and family that now feel like they will never be the same. After a suicide attempt I landed myself in a psychiatric hospital for just short of a week and had a long, painful, withdrawal-ridden look at what I had done with my life. I told myself I would never touch the stuff again but the second I got home I dosed myself right back into the corner I was so desperate to escape from. Many months passed of getting nowhere when I stumbled upon this subreddit and finally felt a glimmer of hope. After a couple of failed taper attempts I was ready to give up, but a few psychedelic trips nudged me in the right direction and I decided to try again. This time I threw any taper schedule out the window and just started by lowering each of my doses by 0.5-0.2 grams then waited until I felt I could lower it some more — typically I would wait a about a week then lower my dosage, but when my doses were sub 10g a day this became more difficult. So I would lower my doses by 0.1-0.2 grams at max every 2-4 weeks. The only rule I strictly followed was to NEVER increase my dose once I had dropped it. I didn't care how long this taper took, the goal was to move as slow as possible to reduce as much physical and psychological discomfort as possible. And it worked! When my dose was around 0.1 grams a day (I know people typically jump at much higher doses, I just had bad experience with that in the past) I tripped on some shroom tea and when I woke up the next day I had no physical or psychological discomfort great enough to push me to dose. Just thinking about all the pain I've caused others and myself with kratom has been enough to snuff out any cravings I've faced. I know 2 weeks isn't really that long, but it's the longest I've gone without kratom in YEARS and I have NO WITHDRAWALS! My body feels great and I'm finally beginning to rebuild my connections with my family and the future looks brighter than it ever has. Even though I still have crippling anxiety I know i'm only moving forward. I owe it to this wonderful sub for inspiring me and giving me hope when I was at my worst. I wish the best to all those out there looking to quit this prison of a drug. If I can do it, you definitely can. Love you all! (also sorry for wall of text, I'm no good at writing/formatting)",25,0

I have tried to help him ween, go CT, I've taken his keys/credit card and hid them (per his request), ect. I feel I have done everything I can and it is obviously not enough to help him quit. He has been an active user for about 4 years and has been trying to quit for the past 3..it has been the most exhausting 3 years of my life. He takes about 100-120 capsules daily. He isn't the same person I met when we first fell in love and I want nothing more than to have him back. He is more than likely always in a bad mood. He lies, sneaks behind my back, hides it in our house and it has left me to constantly be in a state of paranoia. I am truly scared that one of these days he is going to slip through my fingers and let this addiction overcome his whole life. Our sex life is nonexistent unless I basically beg for it which makes me extremely insecure. He won't go and get professional help either which is also very frustrating.

I will admit that when I find out he is lying or using again, I become very angry and have flushed capsules, threatened to leave him, called his parents for help and I know that is probably the WORST thing to do and it probably makes him use more so than if I calmly spoke with him about it, but I can't help it. I get so angry and disappointed and it resets my anxiety and paranoia all over again. I just don't even know what to do anymore. He just doesn't see what this is not only doing to him, but what this is doing to me as well. I can't leave the house without thinking he is going to get more or if he goes to a friends house, I get paranoid that he will use with them.  I have become very depressed and want this part of our lives to be over with. Any advice will be very much appreciated..",1,0

Getting ""hypnic jerks"" every single time I try to sleep.","So I've gotten only maybe a combined 3 hours of sleep the last 5 days. I keep getting ""hypnic jerks"". Only way I know to describe them is that JUST as I'm RIGHT ABOUT to fall asleep, I'll lurch forward and let out a gasp as a huge jolt of adrenaline courses through my veins. This happens almost every single time I try to sleep. I'm super lucky if it doesn't. And if it doesn't happen immediately, it will happen within an hour of falling asleep. Only slept more than 30 minutes once.

I used kratom for around a year and a month or two at a very consistent 14-20g, depending on my eating habits. Suddenly, after New Year's, something changed. I was barely even feeling kratom at all anymore. Each dose would only last like an hour or two when I used to be able to space doses out so far! What? I've heard a few people say this happened to them too but I guess I never believed them for some reason.

I used to be able to take a bigger nightly dose and have it last all night. Now I'd be waking up in withdrawal.

Then I had some intestinal issues come up (severe constipation) and realized that this was getting serious. Tried everything--Miralax, magnesium, enemas, etc. Started getting really uncomfortable. Was only able to get small amounts out, even with an enema. So I decided, well, I probably shouldn't be putting all these empty calorie kratom capsules into a system made for food. At least quitting might stall me a little bit of time before having to go to the ER and getting an emergency colostomy or something.

My lord those first 3 days are something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.

So here I am, day 5 (and finally feeling ~~slightly~~ **quite a lot** better) and happy to be done with kratom. Sure, I was kind of forced to be done but I've tried tapering down in the past and have really really wanted to quit.

Sure, I'm on day 5 but it feels like day 10 since I haven't gotten much relief via sleep! With the combination of my stomach feeling horribly distended and the hypnic jerks, I will never use kratom again.

I feel like I'm going to go insane from the lack of sleep. I'm just so exhausted. Luckily I don't have to work or anything right now, so if anyone in the world should volunteer over others to get these side effects I guess I should be one of ones that gets them. If I only knew kratom could do this, I never would have EVER used kratom long term. Life is pretty hellish right now.

Oh yeah, and my close up vision has gotten way worse due to the lack of sleep. I had to turn the text size to the max on my phone and iPad, otherwise I have to focus so hard to read anything.

Please don't let it ever get to this point. You never know how your body might react to being on a substance like kratom for so long.

I do have a question regarding naltrexone. I’ve heard of LDN and ULDN. So my question is, is there a dose I can start taking now that would ease withdrawals without causing PAWS?

I’ve got 50mg pills, which I know would send me into PAWS. But I’ve got a pill cutter, 30ml bottle, and a 1ml dropper. I am really hoping there is a way to help myself get off this once and for all with a small dose of Naltrexone then titrate up when it’s safe.

After falling back into a Kratom addiction due to a relapse, I am trying to free myself once again. I am planning to make the jump next Saturday, February 1st, and in the meantime, preparing the best that I can to make things as comfortable as possible.

For me, withdrawals are very, very intense, and I usually “break” on day two due to the cravings, intense anxiety, and RLS. For some reason, I have not been able to beat this addiction due to the withdrawal symptoms, although I’ve done a lot to minimize my triggers.

I have took time to read this sub’s wiki on supplements to help aid me for this journey, as well as some of the recent posts on here. I have L-Theanine, some CBD and Black Seed Oil, and Agmatine. I saw Kava listed within the “Supplements” section of this sub’s wiki, so last night night on Amazon, I ordered some dehydrated Kava juice. 

I’ve read that Kava can help relax you, and most importantly, it is non-addictive (read on multiple sites). My fear is replacing one addiction for another, so I wanted to know if any of you have used Kava for Kratom withdrawal, and if you can confirm that it is not addictive. Additionally, does it work well for withdrawals in your experience?

Thank you for reading my post. I really want to get better. Kratom has turned on me, and I am at one of the lowest points in my life. I have been suffering very badly, and I am very angry at myself for getting back to this point. If anyone out there is thinking about quitting soon, would you want to quit together next Saturday?",3,0

I’m a long-time lurker never poster. And as with most who are regular,  heavy(ish?) Kratom users, I know it’s time to quit. I’ve only been using for about 8 months - but in that time I’ve quickly ramped up to about 25 gpd. On the plus side, it’s helped me lose weight, helped with sleep, curbed alcohol cravings (another AWESOME addiction I have), and provided an evening ritual I look forward to every day. 
On the other hand, it is absolutely KILLING me. My kidneys are pissed off. My skin is a hot mess. My hormones are completely out of wack. And I have little to no motivation to get off my couch and do ANYTHING with myself. I feel like a spectator of my own life.
I know i have to quit.
However...
I. Am. Terrified.
Even as I type this, I can’t stop the tears. I am so afraid of sinking back into alcoholism. As dumb as it sounds .... I’m terrified to gain my weight back. And I don’t know what the hell I’m going to do with myself in the evenings. (Hence. The subject line). I live alone and work a job that is pretty high pressure and stressful. My evening Kratom ritual is what I look forward to at the end of the day. It eases me out of my loneliness and takes the edge off the stresses of my day. (I mean. I’m also a total zombie every evening, of course. Ugh)
All of that said... thanks for reading all of this. It helps to get it off my chest.

On top of that I didn’t care about problems, whether it was mine or someone else’s. I also ignored family members who I love and are close to. Anytime I would be on a phone call with them it would feel as if though the one thing on my mind was hanging up on them. If something serious would go on or a problem would arise, all I would want to do is take more to numb myself from having deal with it or to numb the emotions from it (but not actually do it). And I know it’s the Kratom because it has now gone away since I’ve stopped taking it, which was 3 days ago. I hope and pray this will be the last time I ever take this crap again. 

I never wanted to use kratom, and always try to get off of it when I can, I don’t have cravings or desires for it. And because of that I don’t consider myself addicted, just physically dependent and I think I was just starting to get bad side effects from it.

Let’s forget about how much, low long or what led you to use Kratom but rather focus on what the fuck your going to do about quitting your Kratom use. All too often we try to validate or qualify to be a Kratom addict and we try to compare to others addiction (I am guilty as well). Perhaps we psych individuals out because the dosages are not comparable and therefore it strikes fear into people seeking advice to quit and they continue to be stuck in addiction. This much I know. The plant is sneaky and toxic when used regularly. I am on day 24. I am on a fantastic 4-day streak of good days. I am Leary and on guard but I am digging this hope. I have found so many things in the last day that makes me truly happy. For example; watching teen titans, hiking the elevation gain 1 extra time, washing my inside car windows so I can actually see, listening to Cortez the killer (20 min song) while fake tanning, letting my kid drive on my lap, luxurious bar soap, party line call my sisters, my e-cigg (gotta quit this one), actually conversing with my colleagues. The negative is I have back pain again. It’s been awhile since I felt this. I will not allow it to slow me down but it’s something to note that started at about week 2.

I had a fever and runny nose for 2 days, body aches, etc
The crazy part is that I had no idea that these were effects of kratom withdrawal as I had no negative effects from quitting for the first day or 2 after quitting. 
It wasnt until I watched a video of another kratom users withdrawal experience an hour ago and did some research that I put the two together. 
Today I started to feel a bit better... and I am hoping to actually be able to sleep tonight.
Hoping that I can resist the urge to dose again as it is so readily available and I enjoyed its effects so much.
I dont want to have to be dependent on a substance to cope with my anxiety anymore. I want to face my fears head on
 I wish that I hadn't been lied to about the extent of the withdrawals. So many users act like you could just stop anytime with no side effects except for the absence of it in your system.

Last June I was on kratom for around 4 months at 50gpd before quitting CT, but somehow, this time it is so much harder for me to quit. When I quit the first time, I had many more physical symptoms than mental ones. This time, I have very few physical symptoms (no RLS or aching... just slight fatigue), but the mental symptoms are so much worse.

I don't have much trouble getting to sleep at night, but every second I'm asleep is filled with the most horrible nightmares I have ever had. From the second I wake up to the second I go to bed the next day, I'm in a completely derealized state and am somewhat traumatized by those dreams. I still feel like I'm in a dream the whole time I'm awake. Everything feels unfamiliar and I feel like I don't know any of the people around me. I really can't put into words how horrible it feels.

I've decided that I just need to wean off slowly. Fortunately I was able to find a place that sells 1000g bags for very cheap, so weaning off shouldn't be a financial difficulty as it was before.

It is true from what I've read that day 4 is more of a struggle than the previous 3 days.

I only used plain leaf for about 6 months before switching exclusively to extracts, with no break in between. I can only say that this is the hardest thing I've ever had to do.  I spoke to my wife yesterday for the first time since she said she wanted a divorce. (Acutes had me so down that I couldn't even hold a decent conversation). I think we are headed in the right direction. She sees how intense this is for me and she appreciates the effort I've been putting in to quit.

It felt just like a typical flu...

I've learned to rough out the crashes after each dose and deal with it much better.  They do seem to get easier, but i still feel fatigued in varying amounts when it wears off, however, i am much less psychologically addicted.  I even wait longer than 6 hours sometimes just to test myself. I keep skimming my doses and decreasing slowly each dose, trying to make the previous days doses less than before.  When I dose,I feel overall better than when i dosed more frequently AND with more quantity.  That being said, i'm afraid to ""just jump"".  


I definitely still have my reservations.  I don't even know my end goal with kratom, though i'd like to quit completely, i don't believe I am there yet to just CT anyway.  Please take that into consideration if i get several replies stating ""just jump!"", but then again the more i hang around this sub, the more i do get motivation to quit sooner or hold out longer between the next dose.    


the three biggest negatives i have it the lethargy, clammy chills, and timing my schedule with my kratom dose.  I've been better trying not to ""synchronize"" my schedule with my doses and just taking them as they come and less eager looking at the clock even, sometimes even working out for 1 1/2 hours when i was ""supposed"" to dose an hour ago which is crazy to me, so i'm definitely progressing at least.    


Not sure what i expected to get from this, but will these benefits continue to get better as i keep decreasing my dosage?

My prescribed meds have eliminated symptoms, and I want to share this info with those in need","I just need to rant, but I also have tips on what made me withdrawal symptom-free in bold.

I've wanted to make the jump for a year.  I'd start a taper, and then (excuse the crudeness) I'd get cramps and the pain drove me back to my regular dosage.  While my headline says 65+ hours, that last dose was actually only 1/3 my regular, and the previous full dose was about 30 hours before that.  I had a little left, and decided to take it at midnight out of fear of RLS.

I have been on medication for anxiety and depression for years, and they seem to have eliminated my withdrawals.  I know this sub feels very strongly about subbing one addiction for another.  But I've been a kratom user for 4 years, I've been in treatment for my conditions for 20.  

Before my jump, I did a lot of research on serotonin and opioid receptors.  I figured out which receptors my various medications hit, and which receptors kratom hit.  While my meds did manage to hit the same 5-HT2a receptor that kratom does, none of them hit the opioid mu receptor, so I was still worried it would still resemble opiate withdrawal.  Science is not my area, this is very much layman's terms, I just wanted to understand.

At night, I lie in bed, and I get a bit anxious. I think I'm getting the RLS, but it's in my head.  I know RLS, and I know the difference.  I'm carrying a bottle of pepto and imodium in my purse, and haven't had to use either.  I am experiencing chills, but it's hard to say if that's because it's 40 degrees outside, or a symptom.  But I'm stunned. I was expecting a baby to crawl on the ceiling and rotate its head 180 degrees.  And if you don't get that reference, it's just to say I was expecting the worst week of my life.

**So here's the meds I'm taking.**  Some of these have been talked about before on here, but I think it's important to reinforce.  

**Buspirone** (buspar) 45mg/day for anxiety. 15mg tablets, 3x a day.  It's not a benzo or anything that exhibits any feeling or high. For anyone suffering anxiety, which I think every kratom user does at some point, this med changed my life.  I used to wake up several times a night from multiple bad dreams, because my anxiety was just so bad it infiltrated my subconscious.  I read a study that they gave this same dosage to people in opiate withdrawal, and managed to see no wd symptoms.  

**Gabapentin**. This one is tricky.  I was prescribed 100mg tablets for 3x a day, then was told by my therapist to not take it.  I read taking 300mg at night will alleviate RLS.  I also read medical trials saying that 1600mg a day for opiate withdrawals eliminated the symptoms.  The pharmacist gave me the go-ahead for the high dosage knowing it was short-term for withdrawals.  I've just been taking 200-300mg doses at morning and bedtime, and anytime I feel anxiety, overwhelming sadness or RLS coming on. Trying not to exceed 1000mg/day.

**Propanolol** 20-40mg a day for anxiety.  *I feel the need to say this: The name is similar to Propofol, which is the anesthesia sedative that killed Michael Jackson, so let me just emphasize, NO, THIS IS NOT THAT.* This is a beta-blocker. It lowers your heart rate, which is helpful during anxiety.  I've also seen this one named in withdrawal studies as helping.  I actually went through opiate wd about 10 years ago, and got tachycardic, which is to say my heart rate went through the roof.  I don't see many people talking about that with kratom wd, but I thought this might be a good safety net.

**Trintellix** 20mg a day antidepressant for major depressive disorder.  I just started this about 6 weeks ago, and it takes a month for most SSRIs to start working, so good timing.  But in doing my researach on receptors, this med does more to them than any other I researched.  If you want me to elaborate, just ask. Or google.

**I genuinely believe the combination of** ***Buspar, Gabapentin and Propanolol*** **is the cocktail that eliminated the withdrawal symptoms.  I'm not advocating using medication not prescribed to you, a Doctor can give you any of these medications.  If not all 3, even one will help relieve in some capacity.**

This previous weekend something happened to where I start getting extremely shaky in front of some in laws and it was the straw that broke the camel's back. I took my last dose on Sunday. Monday was pretty shitty but it was more so just the mental rebound anxiety. Tuesday was fine until I went to sleep and then the rls kicked my butt because I though zzzquil would be a good idea. Avoid that at all cost. Wednesday I woke up with extreme pupil dilation in full withdrawal. It was horrible. I went to work until 1 and then had to leave. I went home and had a glass of wine and passed out. That night I actually slept very well. Today was rough but I mitigated it with 1.5mg of kpins. It basically took the withdrawal away completely. I am hoping that when I wake up tomorrow that i will be on the home stretch. Hopefully i will not have to use the kpins. I just want to say that when this substance starts affecting your daily life - it's time to give it up. Make the decision, make the jump,and know that in the heat of it, you are stronger than that substance. I'm expecting one more day of minimal w/d and then i think I'm done with the physical stuff.

I do have a question though. For those that have made it past this stage what can i expect in the weeks to  come? Does it get more difficult? I am on straterra and ha e noticed that it completely does help me with cravings and impulses. I do believe that this will be of paramount importance in the coming weeks. Any advice would be appreciated!",4,0

I can't wait for the morning so I can officially say I have been clean for a week!  Come to think about it, I don't know if I have gone 1 week in the last 20 years without (in this order) alcohol, weed, alcohol, or kratom.  I was not really an alcoholic, but I abused it.  Weed too.  I used kratom to ween myself off my nightly alcohol use, which is why I justified taking kratom for so long.   When I came clean to my wife about my kratom use last week, I told her I want to live a completely sober life and that is what I intend on doing.  For the last few years, I may have 5-10 drinks a year.  I use to have 5-10 drinks every 2 or 3 days.  I may smoke weed once a year.  Back in the day, I would smoke several times a day.  But kratom was filling that void.  I believe I just need to be completely sober. 

I don't have several other vices, but I have been reflecting on my sins.  Once this is out of the way, I can focus on ridding myself of other sins and really dedicating myself to a life of grace.  But this idol must be thrown into the pits of hell first!

How is today?  I think I feel better overall, just exhausted.  Didn't sleep very well last night.  I was asleep for 1 hour when my dog woke me up to take a dump and escaped into the front yard.  I was chasing him down in my underwear.  Took awhile to fall back asleep and was up every hour and a half.  The tingles are very small today.  The brain fog is going away.  Still lethargic and listless, but here at work and getting stuff done.   

LIST OF POSITIVES

My car has not had green dust all over everything for the entire week.  I detailed it day 2 so I didn't see traces of this shit.  I like my dark interior a lot better now.  

My desk has no green powder on the keyboard, chair or floor.  

Walked by the trashcan I threw my kratom away in today for the first time and felt relieved.

My schedule no longer revolves around when I am taking kratom.  

Have been going to bed with my wife.  Usually, I would stay up much later than her and we would never go to bed together.  

Starting to get in a more physical play mood with my kids.  

Not having to lie or excuse myself to take kratom.  

The worst of the withdrawals are gone, except the sleep part.  But I didn't sleep for years when my kids where babies so I can deal with it.  

My bench press is really good right now considering less calorie intake and lack of sleep.  

My body has not looked this lean since I was a teenager.  It is like I did an involuntary cut.  

Looking forward to a Spring break trip where I don't have to sneak kratom at gas stations during stops or rush dinner or fun to use this trash.  

&#x200B;

That's about it.  Taking a little longer than I anticipated, but from the looks of it I have several years of different abuses I have never completely dealt with.  Things are really looking up.

A final quote I have been reflecting on during this time from Augustine of Hippo:

I'm a 2+yr daily user who has quit in the past several times, but never made it past \~30 days. I have almost always CT'd, with one exception where started to successfully taper but was not able to control it for more than a week. I believe that the CT route is just too rough on me, both physically and mentally (my average consumption was \~30gpd, at worst nearly 80gpd) at the end of last month I tried to CT once again, made it about 2 weeks with gabapentin and a ton of cannabis. I ran out of the comfort meds, then started that painful roller coaster of relapse/quit/relapse.

I always choose the CT route because I am honestly not able to control my use, this was the flaw in my previous taper, even at my most disciplined state I was not able to control it. The problem is that after such a long period of high dose, daily use, CT is way way way too painful. I know that if I manage to taper to a low dose and jump it will be much easier but it seems impossible to do by myself, So, what to do?

Well, I am living with my family at the moment (2 grandparents and dad) and after discussing it with them, we decided to do a controlled taper, with my dad basically nursing out doses to me and keeping the big bag under lock and key. He has been aware of my battle with this drug for some time, so he basically understands the nature of the addiction (he is a recovering addict himself, alcohol/cocaine) So, we sat down and created a tapering schedule after getting a controlled baseline of how much I need a day, and how much I can take to keep the harsher parts of WD at bay WITHOUT getting high.

Today is the first day of the taper and I feel so much better about things. I am not anxious about quitting and feel like I finally have some control over the situation. I am dropping to 20g, possibly less, today. My dosing schedule is 5x a day, 3.5-4g per dose and looks like this: Wake/Morning/Afternoon/Evening/Bed. So far I have taken only 2 doses of 3.5g and feel absolutely fine.

My biggest goal while tapering is to get to a gym, I need to replace this awful addiction with some healthy habits. My appetite/weight is completely screwed up from using (I am underweight and have no appetite) so eating more and healthier is also a big goal. Also, I plan on finding a part time job until the spring. One thing I have learned after all these years is that you need to stay busy. 

One trap I plan to avoid is creating a narrative around my use and quitting. I have no expectations, only goals. I get so amped up to quit then end up creating this narrative explaining why I am where I am and where I am going to go and it ends up biting me in the ass in the long run. 

I am so grateful that I have someone to help me with this, and super grateful for this community, and I will keep updating on the daily.",4,0

I’m sick with the flu right now so I have body aches everywhere and I cant even differentiate between the Kratom RLS and the flu aches so mine as well do it now. 

Last time I was on Kratom before I quit the last time I was always getting horrible chest pain, breathing problems and this would make me panic bad, to the point I would be at the hospital often (was always ok though). Now this time again it has started, the chest pain and not being able to breathe. Fuck this shit I know it’s killing me, it’s actually a very bad drug I I see no difference between this and illegal opiates. Matter of fact I think it’s worse because I would’nt even get these symptoms on heroin. The withdrawals are no joke and they last very long, this drug is powerful and has so many things in it besides Mitragynine, who knows what it’s really doing to our bodies. Look people are even having seizures. 

Besides that I was a huge gym enthusiast, I would go 5x a week, now I havnt gone in forever. Also Kratom really does just suck, I mean what kind of drug do you need to dose 5x a day?! Shit this is the real monkey on your back. Everyone say methadone is a monkey on you back but it’s Kratom that really is, methadone you dose 1x for the day and that will last 48hours, Kratom not only sucks as a drug but it also is slowly killing me.

I have been using K for just over a year, and previous to that I was abusing codeine, which initially was prescribed for back pain. Of course now we know that kind of medication is no use for chronic pain.
 
Its time to quit, I’m tired of being a puppet to some one else’s goals!
 
So I was using 45/60gpd at different times and have decided to Taper with what I have left.
 
I halved it to around 30gpd straight away for the beginning of the taper, it was surprising to find how little I actually needed and felt pretty much ok.
 
I spilt the doses in to four, 8am/12pm/4pm/8pm and made the last night time one a little bigger to help any sleep issues.
 
For example, I did 7g/7g/7g/10g
 
tapered to about 22gpd over a three day period where I am now doing 5g/5g/5g/7g over three days, still feeling OK. little edgy in the last hour but otherwise OK. Oddly I’m sleeping all night and feel ok in the morning. 
 
after each three day period I reduce each dose by 1g, so next for me will be 4g/4g/4g/6g, and so on…
 
the biggest thing I must stress which is helping me keep to this, is changing your mind set to ONLY TAKE ENOUGH TO KEEP PYHSICAL SYMTPOMS AWAY, do not take it to get high. For example I’m finding the night time dose a little strong now, so the next night I reduced this by 1g. although nice I’m not doing my self any favours I don’t think. Remember just enough to feel normal.
 
I have about three weeks to go, I’ve no idea this will work as this is the first proper time I have tried a plan like this. I jump on Feb 14th, then I have some supplements and my weed vape to help me sleep if required.
 
I’m not saying it’s going to be easy, But I do know I’m done with this and come what may I AM Stopping!!
 
Good luck gang!

I was absolutely miserable.  I decided to close both of my businesses because they weren't worth the ""stress"" they were causing me.  I stopped leaving the house, stopped talking to friends, stopped wanting to live, and felt myself actually dying.  I had daily abdominal pain and extreme nausea.  I woke up daily to alcohol withdrawals (auditory/visual hallucinations, muscle spasms, tremors, cold sweats).  I was light sensitive and wanted to sleep away every moment I could.  At this point I still didn't suspect the Kratom was causing me any problems but I wanted to quit to clear my head.  I didn't know what to do and out of desperation I decided I would use an old addiction (THC) in a desperate attempt to save my life with plans to quit the less toxic THC once I was no longer dying.  
  
I decided to quit the alcohol first since it is likely the most toxic.  I had severe WD for 2-3 days but then felt much better physically (possibly a focal siezure or 2 but with no health insurance I will never know).  However, all of the worst psychological symptoms lingered... and lingered...  I still hated music, I still didn't want to be around anyone, I still had no sex drive,  I still didn't enjoy any of my old hobbies, and I still didn't see why someone would put a ""life is good"" bumper sticker on their car.  
  
At this point I had been off of alcohol for well over a month and was surprised to still feel this way.  I started suspecting the Kratom.  I decided to start measuring my doses again.  I weighed one of the 2x usual spoonfuls I take several times per day and it weighed over 7 grams...  I had been taking upwards of 15g doses several times per day and didn't even know it.  This was my wakeup call.  
  
I decided I would immediately go back to a normal 3-4g dose supplemented heavily with THC and then taper from there.  I did this, and had some moderate physical WD symptoms but mostly psychological.  I was in a state of agitated mania for about 2 weeks straight.  I slept very little and talked very very fast.  Each day I estimate that I read at least a hundred pages of text and walked several miles.  I started to obsess about mental illnesses and thought I must certainly be manic depressant at this point.  Toward the end of week 2, I was thinking I'm just not right mentally and that I need to just give up and go on disability.  I had also managed to get my dosage down to a single 2-4g dose right before bed.  I got to the point where if I tried to relapse and take my normal dose, I would vommit violently within minutes since my tolerance was so low.  I knew it was now or never.  
  
Days 1-3 CT were rough but not as bad as I had feared.  The mania ramped up to a new level and I was certain beyond the shadow of a doubt that I'm manic depressant.  Day 4 was still really bad but I noticed I was feeling very emotional about things and that music didn't annoy me any more. I was sleeping 1-2 hours per night if I slept at all.  Day 5 and 6 brought the end of my mania.  I slept 8 hours each night and felt extreme lethargy during the day.  Day 7 I slept 16 hours.  So here I am on day 8 CT.  I don't drink alcohol or Kratom anymore, but my THC consumption is high.  I like music again, my sex drive has increased some, I have lost 25lbs, I am experiencing nostalgia, I have hope for the future, and I feel like there is emotion attached to everything and it is incredible.  It is hard to explain this to someone who has never been numb before but I think most of you will understand.  
  
As my mind clears, the damage the THC is doing is becoming more obvious.  The complete lack of REM sleep and absence of dreams is disturbing.  It clearly decreases motivation and interferes with my reward center.  I have the THC in my sights now and am about to pull the trigger.  I am about to be completely sober for the first time in a long time.",16,0

I've been on extracts for a long time. Then powder at very high amounts. I estimate at my highest I was using 50 to 60 GPD. I basically had kratom in my life for damn near 9 years. I started tapering in October of 2018. I didnt plan on dragging it out for over a year  but I did. You need to figure out how much you use. I bought a scale and determined how much I was at. It takes discipline and patience. Find a good dose for you. I went to about 40 gpd to start my taper and just rode it out for a few weeks. It was hard for a few days but you get used to it. I kept dropping like that every few weeks but I would take off 3 grams or so. Eventually I got  lower and lower and started taking capsules that were .5 grams. I'd reccomend the capsule route to anyone. Powder weighed out is hard to keep track of and honestly it never looks like enough in a bag or pill bottle. Capsules always seemed like more. I kinda leveled out at 15 Gpd for some reason. I wasn't ready to quit or withdrawal. I stayed there for about a month. I ended up starting to drink a bit again but hangovers triggered me to take more. I'd advise not drinking while ct or taper. The last year or so of my life was really apathetic and depressing, even when I was down to like 5 grams a day. It never got better as long as I was taking kratom. Even down to the 2 gpd mark. I tried a million supplements and then some. Finally tried bso and it really potentiated even those small doses. I took .5 gpd for 3 days before stopping. I ended up jumping 10 days ago. It's been pretty damn smooth. Last night I was watching breaking bad and was laughing at something pinkman said. I laughed and it felt good. It felt real. Real fuckin emotions. I still have my moments but I can sleep decent, no physical symptoms besides mudd butt, and slight anxiety but it's probably normal to feel anxious sometimes. I never felt anything close to when I cold Turkied and those shit withdrawals. Everyone's different but it's tough and especially if you use long term or high amounts. My method probably isn't the best but I had very little withdrawal. You can probably accomplish what I did in 3 to 6 months. If I would known how much greener it is on the other side even after this short while I would have done it a lot quicker.",3,0

I guess more than anything it's just that my emotions are way more intense now.  I feel good, but I feel everything tenfold again.

So, given how good the combo of those pills and the kratom made me feel, i decided I should stack them on my kratom every day! Big mistake.  I didnt find out until later that those pills contain phenibut. I have  no clue how much they add into their "" proprietary blend "" but my tolerance has gone up quite a bit. So on a given day, it's pretty standard for me to dose 4 or 5 pills, 3 times a day. At first, they were great. But I've started to notice weird side effects, that I never experienced in my years of kratom use. I didnt even know what phenibut was, until i started to look into what the ingredients were on the back of the limitless package. I have pretty rough bags and dark circles under my eyes. My skin is grey. I look horrible and feel like a god damn zombie. I've been attempting ( and failing repeated) to quit in my weekends off work. So i actually decided i needed to take time off work to get through this. I read alot of posts on here about tapering and horror stories of cold turkey experiences. I'm  out of money. But I have a fairly large window of time to get through this. I do have a small stash of xanax, and a little bit of kratom left, but I'm about to be out of that and plan on going cold turkey off both the kratom and the limitless pills. I've tried scouring all of your posts that seem similar and relevant to my situation, but realized I should just make a post of my own. So here I am. I'm wondering what you guys think I'm in for. Or if you have any useful tips on getting through this .. thanks in advance. It's amazing to me, the atmosphere and positive support found from random strangers on reddit.  You guys are so helpful and supportive of each other. It's a beautiful thing. So, I'm adding my story to the list and hope to hear some input. Thanks",5,0

At points of consuming 60gpd and then just having 10gpd once in the morning. Ive been through the gauntlet of other drug addictions, coke, heroin, benzodiazepines, alcohol, gabapentin, tramadol, all that good stuff. All of which I managed to cease....but in the meantime compensating with kratom. Kicking most of those at home. Alone. No friends i knew because I was constantly moving states and living a faster lifestyle.

As ive reached my late twenties, things have died down. Settled down. Ive held office jobs, boughten a vehicle and have a VERY BORING routine. But! My routine revolves around kratom. I drink 5gs at 7  the morning. 5gs at 12 or 1 oclock in the afternoon. Those two doses being white kratom. When I get home from work at drink 20gs yellow or red. I revolve all my eating habits around that cycle to ensure that I feel my dose. I revolve my day to ensure I dont miss it. I keep a stash at work in case I have to stay late. When i took a trip last year, I spent hours googling local laws and federal laws to make sure I could take it with me at the airports.

My mother called me and said ""Limpy Dave (lol!) I know youve said you wish you cpuld stop the kratom and I'll support your life and bills while you make that transition"".

I didn't know what to say and its thrown me into a depression. I wish i could drop everything and take a month of wook to recuperate. If i do it, then I'll be looking for another job while dealing with the mental anguish and i don't know what to do. Ive already started to taper and pick up some routines that I dropped when life was pleasant and I actually looked forward to tomorrow. Ive been crying and can't think clearly. Eventually I think the kratom will make its way out of my life. But I am also scared to give up my only vice that seems to keep me somewhat stable and has been there for me during my young adulthood and helped me achieve some self worth.

Love.

154,2020-01-22 16:44:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/esirlw/day_6_here/,Day 6 Here,"Day 6 is here and it is kind of a downer.  I was expecting day 5 to end with a big breakthrough.  Well, instead, I feel pretty much like I did day 5.  Which was a little better than day 4.  Which was definitely better than days 1-3.  The weather is really nasty.  My body still has that tingle fire sensation.  Sleep was about the same waking up every hour and a half.  I have been making an effort to go to bed about 2 hours earlier than I usually do and not drinking coffee after 11 am to try and get somewhat regular sleep.  Here is a list of stuff just to keep me informed in the future and let any quitters know:

&#x200B;

NEGATIVES

The freaking tingle thing is still going on.  Not nearly as bad but is there just about all day.  

The sleep sucks, but I don't get the restless leg thing so that is a plus.

Still sweating at night.

The lack of energy is alarming.  Can hardly play with my kids.

Kind of a fog brain going on.  It has very much cleared though since say day 3 or 4.  

Still short tempered.  

Just generally tired of this overall feeling.

Black rings still under my eyes.  

POSITIVES

Got a ton of work done today.  Reduced my email stack to the lowest points in months.  

Actually starting to think I will be more productive without this junk.  

Stayed at office all day, and like I said accomplished a lot.  

Since I am trying to go to bed early, I said the Rosary this morning instead of my usual night time prayer and it was great.  Trying to do this every day.  

Asked God not to ease my pain but to do what is necessary for me to be healed long term.  If that includes pain reduction great, if not, great.  

Even though I still feel shitty, I also know I actually do feel a lot better.  I was just disappointed because I had my mind set on the 5 day mark for some reason.  

Have had very little to no cravings.  I think throwing it all away made that much easier.  

The weather should be nicer soon.  

Do not miss the feeling of counting the hours between swallowing this stuff.  

Still think the CT is better than the taper and very happy I just went ahead and jumped.

Less sweats at night with the CT than with the taper.  

Looking forward to day 7 and one week without polluting my body.

Last night was rough, I woke up in the middle of the night and had to take a klonopin to calm myself down. Usually this happens 1-2 nights during a CT before it subsided, so I’m not looking forward to tonight. 

I’ve been using lots of CBD products, trying to keep moving with Yoga and martial arts, but sometimes it so damn hard to get motivated. 

This morning I’m just constantly cold but I keep telling myself, I never want to go through a Day 2 again. It’s odd to me what a sneaky substance this is and how easy it is to rationalize. Next thing you know, you’re hooked.

I’m also living in Illinois and have considered weed, but considering I’ve been addicted to alcohol, cigarettes, and binge eating, I’m a bit nervous about weed. I also know that’s one of the few substances I’ve been able to use without abusing.

Anyway, hopefully these withdrawal symptoms go away soon. It’s getting pretty tough, but I’m pushing forward. Taking plenty of supplements, vaping and drinking Cbd, exercise etc. not sure what else I can do.",2,0

One thing that I'm really struggling with is constantly feeling cold.  Not chills like in the beginning, just a bone chilling cold. I often tell my husband that I feel like I can't get warm no matter what I do.  It's almost like it comes from inside of me.  

It's frustrating because I'm finding that it's impacting my motivation.  I don't want to get up and do things because I'm too damn cold. Once I get up and move around I tend to warm up a little, but it's powering through that initial freeze that I'm really struggling with.

Just wanted to let those who are where I was last week know that it does start to get better. I’m certainly not feeling good yet but so much better than I was days 2-10. 

You need sleep (which is where I fucked up) so do what you have to to get it otherwise you’re gonna be in a world of hurt. 

Looking back now wish I’d have better prepared myself with healthy foods, Rx sleep aids, supplements, plenty of bottled water, etc( you won’t feel like going shopping or cooking for damn sure! ) before I quit but I’ve suffered through this many times before and didn’t think I needed it. I was wrong. 

I think that it’s so very important, if not crucial, to replace an addiction with something else in order to become successful in the long run. 

My brain as an addict has mastered the art of picking one thing and obsessing over it, in which my case has been kratom for the past 5 years. 

I successfully quit CT for over 6 months two years ago and failed to make any major life changes. I realize now that that’s 100% why I’m back here now. I got bored with life and “needed” something to escape my obsessive mind. 

So many struggle with relapse because they don’t make the major life changes that give us hope and motivation for a better life moving forward. We need things to strive for not ways to escape reality and boredom. 

This time I’ve chosen mental health, nutrition and wellness as my new obsession. 

I’ve thrown all all the BS processed, cancer causing garbage in my house away and replaced it with the healthiest foods available. I plan to take the $400+ a month I was pissing away on this poison and hiring a nutrition coach next week. 

I saw a psychiatrist yesterday to get my mental health back on track and my anxiety and depression under control. I was honest with her and it paid off because she genuinely wants to help me.  

I spend my time reading and studying about it just like I spent my time doing the same about K. 

Make an effort to find a new obsession that will help create more self love for yourself. When we have self love and confidence we’re not looking for something to numb our lives.

Unfortunately I’ve experienced withdrawal multiple times but for the past four years I’ve struggled with Kratom abuse and the occasional klonopin bender..I’m prescribed klonopin due to ptsd and tic disorder but for me personally they don’t make me feel high and I’d only use them for sleep when the Kratom stopped working and I wanted to sleep well..so I’ve only experienced benzodiazepine withdrawal a few times but I’ve experienced RLS and even felt that annoying tingling in my arms while detoxing off of both Kratom and Benzodiazepines and I can tell you that at least for me just a normal dose of Aleve and Magnesium almost or completely take away the RLS. Once the RLS is taken care of I’ll get on SoundCloud or YouTube and connect a rain storm or sleep meditation to my Bluetooth and I usually fall a sleep pretty fast. Also taking a hot shower or bath after you’ve taken the magnesium and Aleve works wonders! I’ve had other people say that this method works for them as well! I figure that a lot of people are aware that one of the benefits of magnesium is RLS relief but there’s something about the Aleve that is super helpful. I was taking magnesium in the past for RLS but didn’t notice great results until I started taking Aleve with it. The off brand stuff works just as well. Hope this helps,8,0

I can't taper either one, so I'm probably going to end up in the ER if I don't get some sleep soon. Ambien didn't help.

I started a multivitamin which everyone should be on anyways while doing a quit or taper. Seriously, if you don’t know opioids and alcohol and most drugs of any class deplete your body of what it needs to make you brain’s feel good chemicals. Might be obvious but I don’t see it cited often enough in recovery posts. Anyways, sleep still sucks (we will see about tonight) but my mood has become much more manageable after having one of the worst mental breakdowns in my life on day 5. My physical acutes have been gone for a couple day’s now. Went for a nice run today and got out of the house a solid amount. Made sure to feed myself more frequently and earlier than the bad days. Been trying to stay hydrated, we will get there once the bowels chill out. There is hope out there though! If you’re on day 1-4 or 1-5 or 1-6 or even 1-7 HOLD OUT FOR HOPE, it will come. I give a good range because every individual is different but I have done this before and have just done it again. It gets so much better so quickly and you can do it, just don’t give up. 

On another note, spent some time with a dear friend today and he wanted to go to the local tea bar (didn’t know I was quitting again). I agreed somewhat reluctantly just hyped to get out and socialize with my full emotional set back in place. Looked temptation in the eye and said fuck you. Didn’t get any kratom and refused the offer of him buying me a drink. Didn’t think twice about it and on top of that managed to turn down the offers of kava, caffeine, and cbd. Not saying people can’t have those here and there, but FULL SOBRIETY IS ACHIEVABLE. 

Everything aside I want to thank everyone here who has commented on any of my posts and everyone here who supports others on this sub. You guys truly did save me from this addiction and I don’t know if I could have made it this far without some hope and support and help and care and advice and guidance. I love you guys and I KNOW YOU CAN MAKE THIS QUIT STICK! Everything passes in time and so will your WD symptoms and so will your addiction! 

WD symptoms are just that! SYMPTOMS. They are only indicators of a change in your body’s processes and functions. Quitting kratom is obviously going to make you feel off and negative, it’s a huge change. Eventually it will balance out though. Just like the first time you took kratom at a higher amount. You probably felt overly good and maybe even a little nauseous or itchy or irritable. Those symptoms are no different than these. None of the two sets of symptoms are positive or negative, they just indicate a change in your body. 

You’ve got this, stay strong, kick your addiction’s ass, and be aware of the mindset that brought you to be dependent on kratom. Kill the mindset and you will not relapse.",4,0

I’m new to reddit and just looking for some support and helpful tips or info on how to stay clear from Kratom. I had a pretty severe pain pill problem when I was in my early 20s and was clean for six years. I remember looking back at those terrible days and it seemed like nothing but a bad distant memory. I had went to a music festival and once I got home my friend offered me Kratom to help my hangover..I knew nothing about it other than all the positive things you hear about it and little did I know that I would relapse as soon as my first dose kicked in that day..I felt so great and woke up with another hangover the next day so decided to go get some Kratom because unfortunately I was told the day prior of multiple places that sold it. Little did I know until about a month in using Kratom daily for the most part that it was activating my mu receptor and I had relapsed..I found out once the WD’s kicked in and I was devastated. Three years later and I’ve been on and off of Kratom..mostly making it just a few weeks. I feel like a victim and it makes me sick to see gas station workers selling this stuff to people as if they are pharmacists when really all they know are the positive things people are telling them and that they’re making money. I feel like I’ve lost myself and feel lonely as hell because I don’t have anyone to help me. Doctors have no clue about this stuff and the rehabilitation centers I’ve looked into won’t except patients addicted to Kratom..which makes sense because it’s legally sold and in the same family as “coffee” which yeah is true but I drink coffee everyday and only need two cups in the am im not needing it in order to get through my everyday life. People say it helps their sex drive but it’s the total opposite for me..I’m not even interested in finding a partner because of my depression, anxiety and inability to get off when I do have sex. I feel like Kratom is harder for me to kick because opiate dealers are lazy and so unreliable while Kratom sellers work a 9-5 at like ten locations within 5 miles from my place. I’m to the point to where I’m about to try NA but I’m stubborn when it comes to quitting my fav plant marijuana..I just quit smoking pot for five months because of a job but was taking Kratom the entire time. I was laid off and went straight for a dab rig. I just turned 31 and I’m tired of this shit..I’m going to get my old self back and this thread has def helped. We all know there’s not a lot of science or knowledge about Kratom so our experiences and stories is all we really have so thanks to everyone for the encouragement! Also if anyone has any questions about withdrawal help I may be able to help. I find myself researching Kratom, how to cope with withdrawal ,timeline, etc every time I’m trying to kick it. I want it more now than ever so I’m gonna hang in there. The worst part for me is the RLS but I’ve found that a hot bath or shower on top of some ALEVE and magnesium take it away almost every time.

1. Extremely low sex drive
2. Over eating (just not caring. I’ll start my diet tomorrow attitude)
3. No motivation to hit the gym (why bother if I already feel good?)
4. I feel like crap during the few hours I haven’t got my Kratom fix. It’s like a headache and depression.",2,0

I've seen immense benefits already in my relationship with my girlfriend and with my family members. I'm more present, clear, and fun to be around; I laugh a lot more.

However, working is the worst. I have a job that requires me to use my brain all day and write quite a lot, and it's like I cannot get myself motivated to do any of it. What makes it worse is that I work from home a lot -- I feel like I am getting nothing done. I've spent 4 hours already today and all I have to show for it is 1/2 of what should be a simple article.

I have other responsibilities too and I feel like I'm just not performing the work I'm getting paid to do. It sucks because I don't really feel any ""brain fog"" per say, I just can't get motivated and it takes me forever to write.

However, I do remember that when I was taking kratom, all of my productivity would have to be squeezed into that tiny window of euphoria it provided. Before I dosed, I was so hungry that I couldn't focus. After my dose wore down, I was super foggy and unable to think or motivate myself to work.

So in reality I'm probably getting more done than before. It just doesn't feel like it.

Still 100% committed to never touching this stuff again, which I'm proud of. Going to start apartment hunting with my girlfriend for our first apartment together soon, so I'm glad I'll be clearheaded for that.

Overall super happy with my decision to quit despite work sucking right now. Stay strong everyone!",6,0

I won't bore you with my life story, but thanks to military docs misdiagnosing me for my entire enlistment (said I had patellar tendonitis, when in reality I had broken my back in 2003 and symptoms didn't develop for 2 years), I ended up on opiates in 2011, not knowing a thing about them. Cut to 2016, had a spinal fusion, and started toying with the idea of coming off opiates due to my life and marriage falling apart. Finally decided to take the plunge in March of 2017, with the help of Kratom. Three years later, I've decided to be done with Kratom for good. Maybe it's fate...but when I decided a few days ago to quit, I also saw what most Kratom users dread seeing...a senator here in Maryland has put forth a bill to ban it , and the decision will be this Wednesday. That was the final push I needed. No, so far the withdrawal hasn't been as bad as coming off opiates in my case...but it's not my idea of a good time, either. 

Forced myself to go to the gym this morning (was not easy), but I do think it helped. I started going back a few weeks ago and also started eating healthier. I honestly believe doing this has helped to prep my body for going through this. I'm also in the mind space of WANTING to quit...also key. Keeping busy as well, even when it hurts (my back pain feels amplified right now, but had same issue during opiate withdrawal). Overall, my point is this...have faith in yourself. If you truly want this, what's a short duration of time compared to the rest of your life? You have to take care of yourself in order to take care of others.

211,2020-01-20 16:51:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/erkcbi/maybe_this_is_for_you/,Maybe this is for you?,"I'm not sure what it is, I just felt like posting here today. Personally, I'm on Day 36 right now. So that means, assuming I am not a total dumbass I am probably mostly out of the woods. No symptoms, I don't want it, I barely think about it and when I do it's mostly negative. Most importantly, I feel (almost) like me again, and even better in some ways.

I don't post as much as I did the first two weeks I quit. I lurk sometimes, just like I did before I quit. I continue to see post after post of people that are clearly in desperation mode...asking how bad the WDs are going to be etc... and I can remember being there. I really am sorry you are there, also. 

I guess what I want to say is this. If you're questioning quitting, or you have just started... now is the time to decide. If you go in half hearted, you will more than likely fail and it won't be worth it.

Quitting Kratom is interesting... because I feel that it effects us far greater than we can understand right now. Many have said it's harder than herion etc... and right now there's tons of positive news campaigns out there about it, it's easy to get... there's alot of things going against you quitting. But the worst, is yourself.

This will quite literally be the fight of your life. I'm not even going to sugar coat it. The physical stuff, you can live with. It's going to REALLY suck, but you can do it. I mean, if I told you that you had to tough out bad sleep, a runny nose, restless legs and some body aches and maybe even the shits for a week or so to get your life back would you? Probably so. You may hate it, but you could do it.

Where the battle is won or lost, is in your mind.

My friend, whoever you are, I am just here to tell you that right now, you literally have to make up your mind one way or the other. Are you going to do this? And don't lie to yourself. If the answer is yes, then that means NO MATTER FUCKING WHAT, you will do it. 

That's what it took for me. I quit on December 15th. The process, was hell. Some of it, I cannot even explain to you. But you know what got me through? I got really pissed off... and I looked at this as a game. I was going to beat this bitch (I pictured her as a witch, because on my first night of zero sleep and RLS hell, I swear I saw one out of the corner of my eye...probably dozed off for a second or two) at her game, no matter what it took. Whatever she threw at me, I was going to win because I could. That's it. 

Over the next few days, if you've ever gone to the gym you'll know what I am talking about, I started to feel empowerment. The shit was PAINFUL, but the more I resisted it, the more powerful I felt. At times, I could actually enjoy what I was going through, because guess what... it meant I was winning. It meant I was making progress, and it meant I was closer to coming out on the other side. Victorious, not dead, not fucking addicted anymore, not mad at myself or disappointed, but victorious. 

Now... along the way, I can tell you without a doubt, that your mind will play tricks on you. It will make you think that no matter what, you need another dose. It will make you think, oh this isn't so bad... you will feel physically fine for a time and think, I wonder why I am actually quitting because my life really was better with it... that's right before you feel awful again. You're going to have to navigate this stuff with your goal in mind, and again, no matter what. 

Then one day... like I did, you will wake up and somehow you will know you are out of the woods. You will feel ""something"" that changed. I just knew it was over, when it was. And it is... 

And it's worth it. Very much worth it.

This is what you have to do. However you get there... if it's thinking about your family, yourself, your finances, or quite literally just wanting to feel again (that was a big one for me)... when you get there, you're ready.

Finally, when you take the plunge... you take it. And you have to recognize it for what it is. You've just begun your journey and I am here to tell you that YOU ARE STRONG ENOUGH. 

You don't have to let this win anymore, so don't. 

Thanks,",24,0

I was just done with this powder and was going through withdrawals on the taper anyways.  

On Wednesday night I told my wife about my use and addiction.   It didn't go great, but she has been pretty supportive overall.  I had a plan to quit Friday morning at 9:00 am.  That was my last kratom.  I took all my supply and threw it in an outdoor trash can including my backpack I carried it in and any stuff that reminded me of it.  The taper was from about 70 grams over two weeks to about 35 grams.  I am now 76 hours clean.  

The sort of CT is better than the taper.  I sweat less, I am less anxious about quitting and I am just overall done with it.  I am lucky because I don't get restless legs.  I am still not sleeping great, but I am getting some sleep.  When my kids were little, I slept less.  I feel for you guys who don't get any sleep during this.   The first couple of days felt like my skin was on fire.  It still does but less noticeable.  Got the runs.  Pretty irritable.  The worst part is just the general fog I am in.  The fog is about 25% better today but still annoying.   I am even able to work today, mainly because I didn't want to get too far behind.  

The main thing I did that I recommend is going to a Korean Spa the day I quit.  Like I said, my last kratom was at 9 am.  I worked to about 12:30 and then went to this Spa.  It has all sorts of hot rooms, cold rooms, ""healing rooms"", and spas and other stuff that just makes you sweat.  It was a great way to sweat it out and take my mind off it.  I think it helped a ton with the first day and the beginning of the whole recovery.   I actually might go again tomorrow.  

The other things that help are going to the gym and lifting heavy weights and the hot tub.  After about 20 minutes at the gym or in the hot tub I don't really feel any withdrawals at all.  

Another note to people scared to jump ship.  I was terrified for years.  Just do it.  It is not that bad.  You just feel like you have the flu.  But you must also know you are done with it (I was not in the past).  I have not even really had any cravings because I hated being on it so much.  So if you hate your addiction and just want out, it really is not that bad.   Throw all your stuff away.   Find people to keep you accountable (for me my wife and secretary) and just deal with it.   Thanks for the support guys.  I will continue to check in.",3,0

I was on an awful drug (tianeptine) a few years ago.  I got off with the help of suboxone.  I started kratom.  I've been taking heaping spoonfuls multiple times a day.

Life has become gray and meaningless.  I know this feeling.  It's like a tolerance ceiling.  I started measuring it out, realized I'm taking 15gs at a time, 4-5 times in a 24 hour period.

I want to feel again, I want my sense of smell back.  I miss feeling hope, I'm tired of being down and depressed.

I still have leftover suboxone.  Should I just sub myself for a few days and be done with kratom?  Or should I do a taper?  And if taper...any recommendations?

2.3g Phenibut daily (I know, I screwed myself here.  I was at 2.75, but it's slow going.)

Relevant stats-
GPD average: 16-20- split 3 ways
Time: year and a half, only a few weeks off interspersed throughout 
Method: slow taper

In the past I’ve tried CT and successfully made it past the acutes, but never focused on solving the problems that made me use in the first place, so I tricked myself into thinking I could take kratom “occasionally” like I do with other substances (alcohol, weed, etc). The problem is, I like kratom much much more than either of those substances.

I’m in the middle of studying for a huge licensing exam and figured I would not be able to study or retain information if I went CT, so I opted for a slow(ish) taper this time around so that I wouldn’t disrupt my life too much.

Based on many of the helpful posts I’ve read here, I decided that I would reduce by .5 g per day and if my symptoms were particularly bad, I’d maintain the same dose for a day (but never go up).

So far, compared to my prior CT experiences or more dramatic tapers, it hasn’t been bad at all. In fact, the smaller doses have in some ways felt better than when I was doing the larger doses (I suppose it’s true that “less is more”). On the days where I’ve been really tempted to blow the whole thing, I allowed myself to stay at the same dosage as the day before (I.e. not reducing by .5) and that has seemed to work well- the next day I drop another .5.

Today I will drop to 8.5g and feel fine so far. Pretty soon I think I’m going to eliminate one of my three daily doses and sit at two per day for a while. When those doses start to get annoyingly small, I’ll switch to one (at night to avoid the worst of RLS).

Side note: I am on the keto diet, which i feel is somewhat helping through this process. Everyone reacts differently, but for me, the discipline needed to maintain the diet helps give me discipline for my taper, and not having dramatic blood sugar spikes seems to help even out my mood.

Even at this dose, I’m starting to feel more like myself again. Music is sounding much better and sex drive increased. I am, of course, still concerned about things to come when I completely stop use... but it can’t be worse than the previous times that I went CT so I should be okay.

If anyone is like I was- wanting to quit but not wanting to even start a taper bc of how bad it would suck, I hope this helps. It’s not that bad, or at least not for me anyway. Try it! I’ll keep you updated as things progress.

Thanks to all of you here. Really great to have a resource through all of this! Would love to hear any feedback or tips on this method. Always open to improvements. Whatever works!

Ive had no issues really with kratom cravings. But my mind has wandered to day dreaming about ""taking a day off"" using pills. But nope nope nope. Wouldnt want to deal with the day after feeling of wanting to continue that feeling. 

The goods:

Im sleeping, naturally. I even took a 4 hout nap yesterday on top of a full nights sleep. Dreams have been interesting. Very fast paced and seemingly long. A single dream seems to continue all night and is full of excercising. (I was an nfl cornerback one night. I was a parkour dude another night). I count this as going to the gym...

My body temp has stablized. Im not really cold anymore. Sweating has lessened greatly also.  

My social skills are better. Less anxiety about dealing with people. Im a salesman and deal with alot of people.

Days arent as long. Hours seems to be at a normal pace. My longing to get home after work to have a drink to ""take the edge off"" has lessened. I can make to to a reasonable time at night before i have my drink or two before bed. 

Last couple days my lows arent as low. 

The bads: arent bad at all!!, just thing that need more time.

Im still tired. Despite sleeping my motivation is lacking. I work 9-10 hour days, but the second i can leave work, i do. Not interested in the extra mile yet. Finding motivation to do the least amount of cleaning around the house is hard to come by. My dogs arent getting the excercise they need again yet. My love of my hobbies isnt back yet. Its hard to get out of bed in the morning. Often i roll out at the last second. I still have some ups n downs through-out the day. 

Anyways- it was good to list this. Helps me stay up and identify what else i need to work on getting back strong in my life. For those of you on day 10, or 14 or whatever....give everything time. Patience and focus, patience and focus.

All day, everyday I dread what I've become. I am always giving myself the usual excuses on why I should wait just a little longer before trying to quit. Last night was the turning point for me. I have no will to live anymore (but not suicidal) and had a massive argument with my wife. (She knows I've taken kratom but no longer thinks I do). I am coming from a 4-5 extract shots a day habit. Its financially put a strain on us and is just ridiculous looking at it. I've never had a problem with addiction before this. I have been using daily for around 2.5 years. I took my last dose last night around 8pm. I just needed to post on here so I feel I have some kind of accountability since I'm doing this alone. We will see how it goes. I feel like absolute trash this morning (which is expected since I always dose as soon as I wake up). I'm going to try this CT with no supplements.

I found this green slime 6 years ago and after being a lover of opiates (much earlier in life) I thought I had hit the jackpot. For some reason I thought since it was legal that there was no way you could become addicted and have withdrawals... haha, looking back this was my delusional addictive mindset in full force. It escalated FAST and I started taking a lot of it with no intentions of stopping. Until..until the problems started revealing their ugly heads. Hormonal imbalance, mood swings, having to have it or feeing like complete HELL, and the hardest part- the withdrawal sensations (which are brutal).
Kratom is a huge trap and I feel bad for everyone who is involved with it - if you can get off now then do so and don’t be kratom’s bitch. 
The withdrawals do not end after a week they go on for what seems like forever up and down and again. The layers of withdrawal, for some of us, make it near impossible to stay off indefinitely. That is why we end up going back again and again.. Please do not go back because it will only get worse- trust me. Then I met someone where I had unlimited supply for very cheap- so careful what you wish for!!! 
I have been on and off maybe 5 times and now I can say I am off for good. It has been 13 days and no matter how hard it gets I am NOT going back this time. I have changed the friends I keep and have rewired my brain to change my relationship with the plant. We have broken up!  Wean wean taper taper- do it for as long as you need. If you are someone that is in severe pain quitting then taper like a madman. Then you bypass the real shitty symptoms but are still left with depression, lethargy, and not sleeping as well.
Exercise! Yoga! Meditation! Magnesium! Valerian! A good B vitamin (12)- or shot in your butt, healthy food, water, hot tea for the goosebumps. Most importantly have the right mindset and believe in your ability to be free of this plant. Then don’t look back ever!

After dosing every 4 hours, i'd get a noticeable ""slump"" or ""Crash"" after 2 1/2-3 hours of ingestion.  It is horrible and makes me anxious for my next dose.

How addiction is basically a solution that works, but it is a fake solution, but becomes a bigger problem than one can handle. I've struggled and relapsed over 50+ times in the last 3 years, the havok  my weak body had to endure. 

The reality is that kratom was a solution to my inner demons, and it worked. But it was all a lie. Rather, it took my soul, my humanity, and my self-confidence for not being able to beat this addiction. 

After being stubborn and overconfident in myself, white-knuckling, I finally realize that I need help. I need to tackle the trauma, the abuse I endured as a child, and begin to deal with this inner pain inside of me. A lot of people on here have helped me realize this, and I am so grateful. I have hope, and now I am finally getting it. CT is coming, and it is going to suck. But I'll hold on to this new found realization and seek the help that I so desperately could not see I needed.

I hope many of you struggling can get this- that if we don't tackle the real reason why we keep running, then you might endure years of withdrawals like I have. I sincerely hope some of you can get it faster than me so that you don't have to go through this constant battle and the constant crushing mental anguish. We can do this.

One of the biggest triggers was always making the 2.5 hour drive to her house. I'd look at the time remaining on my phone and at 1hr 30mins, I'd be like, ""One more hour and time to dose!"" 

I've made that drive so many times, and only once before (in the very beginning of the relationship) did I go there without bringing any kratom (my habit began right when we started dating -- it was initially an anxiety deterrent that grew out of control). 

Yesterday I got there with a full meal in my stomach and no kratom in my brain. I noticed a huge difference in the experience. I wanted to be very physical with her (hugging, kissing, etc.). I was laughing SO much just talking to her. I was almost euphoric from this new feeling; part of that is the euphoria of knowing I wasn't lying to her.

Before, it was like kratom made me avoid physical contact; kisses even made me sort of cringe because it felt uncomfortably tickly. I barely laughed at all. I barely listened in conversation; I'd zone out and not realize what I was nodding or agreeing about -- it was all for that stupid 15 minutes of euphoria.

It's still hard. The entire house makes me think of kratom; both bathrooms where I would dose in secret, the smell of the place, etc. 

Being still was hard too. We did our normal routine of watching shows, but my legs could not stop moving and I had a lot of physical agitation.

Sleeping was difficult -- I tossed and turned way more than usual. But I actually did get some sleep towards the early morning.

I'm struggling a little right now because she's at work, and that was always the time where I was free to drive to the head shop and get more kratom, or wait patiently for hours for my stomach to empty so I could dose before I picked her up.

But I just have to keep remembering how I felt last night. Day 4 is going ok so far. Here's to making it to day 5.",25,0

Need help and answers PLEASE.,"This is a throwaway acct because I just can't believe I did this to myself.
My experience started with just a few capsules and after upping the dose to about 15 or so I noticed that I felt GREAT!  I ignored what i'd read regarding addiction potential and leaned toward the ""withdrawals aren't too bad or are pretty minor"" .  Found myself ordering the powder online and immediately started using about 2 or 2.5 tsp fulls at a time 2 or 3 times a day for about 3 weeks.  I noticed that I felt like absolute shit in the mornings after my last dose.  Empty feeling inside is the only way I can describe.  Just not in a great mood and pretty lethargic.  Constipation and lack of sex drive were prevalent as well while on this stuff.   I read up some more and decided to throw all i had away.   

1st day off was a Thursday.  Had to leave work that day feeling like I had the worst flu ever coupled with immediate depression.  

Friday felt a little better but noticed that my urine either had blood in it or was just extremely strong.  Almost brown.   I've been drinking a TON of water and just not urinating as much as I should be considering the qty of water I'm drinking.  Seems to maybe be clearing up a little but still pretty dark.

Today is Saturday and even though I felt so much better on Friday, today seems a step back.  Lethargic, feel empty inside, not hungry, difficult to start the urine flowing, headaches most of the day.  I literally feel like I want to be sedated or put under and just wake up when it's over.

Most of what I've read have been people that have used months/years.  I used 3 weeks every single day.
Does any of this sound normal or can a person be very sensitive to opiate type medications?  I remember years ago my Dr gave me Tramadol for pain and it caused me HELL after I ran out.  Severe depression and non stop crying.  After that even years later I tried taking it and experienced the same depression after only a few DAYS.

With the Clonadine, I smell no different than I normally do. Even on day one, I wanted until I had gone about 16 hours since dosing to take my first pill. That nasty familiar smell was already present. Since starting on the Clonidine, it disappeared and hasn't come back.

I just don't agree with a lot of stuff that goes on in this world. Ruining people's lives for the chase of profit... Just an example.

I realized that I'm very very sensitive. Care too much what other people think of me, but coming from being abused as a child (don't want to talk about it), I know there's some psychological damage that I haven't dealt with. Even when the situation deems necessary to put my foot down, I will submit and just lose. I hate this about myself because I know people take advantage often. 

I don't want it to sound like I'm a saint or anything, but this is something I see as a big reason and challenge why I can't ever stay sober. I cannot cope with how to deal with this onslaught of emotions in daily life, or how to live in this hyper-competitive world. 

Anyone have the same problem? Being too nice, too sensitive, no confidence? How the hell do I fix this? I feel like it is just who I am.

The school called and told me my son was ill and I needed to pick him up. I went to the head shop first which took an extra 20 minutes. On the ride back to the school I of course threw back 20 caps.

If i am correct that would mean i am doing 60-80 gpd. Thats insane. And i have a real desire to quit because i have lost alot of weight this last year due to kratom. Its not working the same as it used too and ive notoced that its starting to control different aspects of my life that i dont like. I am particular about ny dosing so it makes it where i dont want to eat so i have an empty stomach. Then after i dony want to eat because i dont want to waist the feeling. Anyways. I want to quit. I really do i just want to know what would be best for somebody like myself that doses so much. Any suggestions or tips would be great thank you guys!

When i dont dose or dont dose enough i get severe anxiety and restless legs and i dont want to expierence that too much if possible.",1,0

Summary of my relapse and new quit

I successfully quit for 65 days.  

I relapsed for 3 weeks while dealing with a nasty sinus infection and headaches.  Relapse dose was 5g 3 times a day at the end of the third week.

Using hydrocodone rx taper to help me quit. 
Day 1 - 7 pills (7.5 mgs)
Day 2- 6 pills
Day3- 5 pills
Day 4- 4 pills
Day5- 3 pills
Day 6- 2.5
Day 7- 2
Day 8- 1.5
Day 9- 1 pill
Day 10-half pill...
Day 11 quarter pill
Day 12 jumped ....

Results-  It has been about 30 days of Kratom/opiate use during the relapse, my use has been controlled and kept as low as possible.  Withdrawals during taper have been occasional light headache and low level anxiety , little bit of insomnia.  Withdrawals increased when I got down-to under 2 pills a day.  So far pretty painless but the real battle starts today, plan to use a few Imodium for diarrhea/withdraws for a couple days and take an ambien for sleep if needed.  Dependence rebuilds very fast if you have been a long time 7 year user like me, even trying to keep usage very low,it builds fast.  I don’t recommend people relapse, not worth having to deal with the entire quitting process, if I did it all again, I would just try and deal with the pain and not use kratom.  I hope my journal is helpful for others going through a similar situation and trying to quit.

Update:  was going to quit at day 11 but still having headaches so I dropped to a 1/4 pill on my taper and extended the taper longer, I am glad I did.  I took 2 Imodium pills for 2 days (last 2 days of taper),.....yesterday took nothing.  
So one day down with no opiates/Imodium/Kratom.  Today is day 2 feel pretty good after my taper, slight anxiety and some light sinus/allergy type stuff like sneezing.  But working the past couple days has been fine, using 1 ambien at night to sleep the past week, now that I am off everything I will taper down the Ambien to 1/2 and then 1/4 over next few days and then I am done with this whole relapse.  

Interesting side note is that I had zero RLS when I quit this time and before that was my worse symptom, not sure why.",2,1

The other day I was looking for some incense to burn and I realized that I am completely out. This caused me to stop and think, “Where do I buy incense?”. I immediately recalled that the place where I used to purchase incense is the same place where I purchased Kratom (Green Malay) on a daily basis.

Flash back to over a decade ago when I successfully quit a near decade of cigarette and tobacco smoking. One of the things I made myself do in order to assist in breaking my psychological addiction to nicotine was force myself to go out to the bars and stand outside around the community of smokers. I would mindfully resist participating in smoking. I would stand there as my new identity, a non-smoker.

I believe that this activity created positive feedback loops in my brain.

**Question: How much of our addiction is an addiction to the pattern of a physical behavior that is done repeatedly?**

**This Monday, January 20th will be my 100th day since my Kratom cold turkey quit.** I plan to go to the head shop where my face has been known for years for my daily Kratom purchases. I am going to walk in, grab a handful of incense sticks and purchase them. I am going to stand at the counter and look at all the baggies of the disgusting green powder and know how much stronger I am now. I will walk out with just a bag of incense.

I was wondering if anyone out there would like to accomplish a similar feat for themselves this Monday, knowing that afterwards they have to report to this community that they did not purchase Kratom. Knowing that they are in the hearts of minds of others when they walk into the store and purchase something that is not Kratom  (and that is also not a substance they will consume). I feel like this could be a huge empowering moment no matter what day of quitting you are on.

I am doing this for sure this Monday, (1-20-2020) and I will report back to y’all with how it felt. Does anyone want to do this with me and reinforce your new identity as a non-Kratom user?",2,0

It’s almost powerful enough to make me want to cop out with a trip to the gas station for a bag of caps. Almost...

Today, at least when I’m not on QK, I am 1000 miles away from that feeling. I smile all the time. I have the emotional skills now to weather dips in mood. I feel no paws at this point.

I go to 12 step meetings every day before work, see a sponsor, take a mountain of sups, work out every day, and sleep more than 8 hours most nights.

I am a ball of energy wound tight.  I worked a 12 hour day straight with little to no break or food.  I was the Energizer bunny fueled on energy drinks and coffee.  I was a little too zazzed if I must be honest, but oh well.  I have been working extremely hard and it's been mostly positive, but my job is super stressful.

The lack of kratom has made me realize... I was using because of work.  I am trying to cope with the stress and anxiety, but I just dont know how.  The weed is helping but not in the way you would think.  It makes me super introspective and is filled with extreme anxiety, but I use it to think about and work on the anxiety.  I largely find it has helped when done properly.

When it's used right it helps me relax too.  I feel like I'm so wound tight I need something to get me to come down.  I think exercise and diet will help too.  God.  I read some old posts and I always say that!  I actually need to do it this weekend.  Anyways, high stress days really affect me more now.  It feels worse and like this is my new battleground.  I am really hoping it clears up this weekend.  I could really use a break from the constant anxiety and stress.  Maybe I will hit up a concert or something this weekend.

Quitting kratom is the same thing. 

Our addicted brain tells us how horrible things are going to be, and how there’s so much to fear. 

But after flicking that switch, deciding to quit... one day goes by, one week, one month... and then you realize there was nothing to be afraid of but your own mind playing tricks on you.

If ur struggling with getting off Kratom and u dose right when I wake up, try this instead. Wake up, take 5-8 lope 2mg tabs (10-16mg), wait two-3 hours and ur anxiety, depression, rls, and others will be gone. Now u will still get the chills, piss like a mfer and a few other things but On the tolerable scale, it is literally night and day. Now there is a problem with this method which I will cover now. If u don’t immediately start tapering the lope u will ultimately wd hard, just a matter of when. The lope hits so many receptors throughout the body, maybe just not the brain like a traditional agonist partial agonist etc, that it alleviates 90% of the unbearable symptoms.

If ur having a hard time tapering or can’t go more then a day CT, stop tapering, try this, after u see how well it works toss ur Kratom in the garbage and u can move on.

Just gonna come out and say everything. This has best Some of the worst depression I’ve had in my life. Feelings of everything being pointless, lack of motivation, not being able to focus on anything for more than a few minutes, feeling weak, feeling anxious and schizophrenic. In my mind I want to make music, specifically put out singles leading to an album. I’m a guitarist and drummer that has been learning to sing record and mix. But I can’t sit down long enough to even focus. All this is being compounded by the fact that I have a house with crawls space problems that’s a really hard fix, have to redo floors get rid of mold underneath possibly replace sub floors and a bunch of other shit. I hurt my back working out so this put a stop to the projects along with the lack of motivation, now this has been looming over my head and I’ve been shutting down slowly. Ignoring phone calls and not wanting to go work to make money. Started drinking a cup of  coffee again in the morinfing and seems to not even give me energy for more than a few minutes then I feel drained and tired again, been the only thing I look forward to. Hadn’t drank in over 3 weeks but slipped a couple days ago and had about 6 beers by self in an hour sitting, regretted it and felt like shit. And also Valentine’s Day is coming up around the corner, I’m single, been that way for awhile and I feel like I have no confidence around women anymore. I feel so out of place and have no one to talk to about this. Want to join a group and do all these things but just can’t just lay around and stare at the ceiling. True Fucking depression. I  have trouble even leaving my house now. Always sleepy but never getting enough sleep, nightmares at night time, and 2 hour long naps during the day that leave me groggier. I feel like such a pussy and have considering caving again, not because I want to take kratom specifically, I just want feel normal. NOW I’m in the thick of it. I feel like I can’t even go to get help anywhere because I feel like a burden and I really just wanted to bitch and vent in a safe place, so this a jumbled mess of sentences but I needed this. I’m telling myself “ go at least 35 days” so I’ll go as long as possible but I need a few victories and am not getting any.

I had a weird dream last night... was driving by a vape shop, stopped and bought a 1lb bag of Kratom for $350 (I hope it was good). . . I remember feeling disgusted with myself after getting in the car, and I threw it out the window on the way home.

I dont know. 

This has been a journey. I've read many stories on here about people still dealing with it a year later etc. If I'm being honest with you, I feel mostly normal. I had a 1.5 year habit that got up to 30 gpd or so.

I'm not going to say I don't have thoughts of it, they creep in, but I would not call them ""cravings"" because while I might for a few seconds think about how it made me feel (once or twice), I then quickly and without any effort at all remember how it actually made me feel, when I took it several times a day and my life revolved around it. That's not a good feeling.

I think since the beginning of our existence, humans are looking for a way to enhance our baselines. Normal scares me a little bit. The times over the last few weeks that I have experienced actual and authentic joy, have been wonderful. The times I've experienced authentic sadness, have been terrible... but mostly, things are just ""normal"". Whether we make ourselves dizzy until we fall over and laugh as kids, drink, have sex, run, exercise, meditate, snort cocaine or jump out of an airplane... it seems to me that humans are consistently just trying to change their baseline normal... kratom was a way to do that for a little while with no consequences.

Consequences... are a bitch. 

So whether you're trying to quit, or you have and you've considered going back... I hope this post was helpful in some way. I urge you to put the shit down... its not worth it, and it wont last. 

K like many things, will give you exactly what you want upfront with asking nothing in return. Over time, it will start to take from you without asking, and will give you less in the process. 

Good luck friends. You can do it, and YES it's worth it.",8,0

REM sleep and routine sleep cycles (including dreams I can recall) has come back to me!  I have had a vast improvement of concentration during the day, and way decreased (usually short duration) anxiety.  

On kratom,  I dont our brains work correctly during sleep.  Brains never got a break, never had time to rest and sort things out while we rested.  For me, maybe this is why my short term memory was shot, I couldn't recall close aquaintece's names, or details of what was discussed in a meeting 24 hours earlier.

On the weird side- had a dream that I was in a meeting at work and somehow a pile of kratom powder- like 2 ounces- fell out of one of my folders and on to the table.  Nobody seemed to notice.  I tried to nonchalantly clean it up, but pile kept growing. Green powder all over the place as a result.

Then the dream continues in other areas of my life.  Wherever I find my self, there is a pile of kratom right there (in my kitchen, on my driveway, at church, etc.).  In fact, I opened up one of my guitar cases to play a guitar I hadn't used in some time, and it had a coating of green. Everywhere the kratom is, I am trying to clean it up and throw it away.  I was not tempted to use,  just baffled by its presence everywhere, and nervous someone would notice.   Again, nobody asks what it is, despite the green- powder  all over me.

Doesn't take a therapist to figure out what's going on in my head, does it?

Stay strong everyone- we've got this.

301,2020-01-15 22:04:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/epd8l1/i_associated_it_with_love/,I associated it with love.,"Two years ago, my girlfriend and I had just gotten together for the first time. We were in college, in that blissful state of life where you don't really have to care about the real world.

Our first few weeks together were heaven on earth; after leaving a broken relationship a few months prior, this felt like the healthiest thing in the world. We were so open. So communicative. Life was finally looking up.

School ended for break, meaning we had a month off. We wanted to see each other still, so she decided to make the 3 hour drive to my house. 

Having a history of anxiety, I was extremely nervous for this. Meeting my parents? My siblings? Showing her around my hometown? Those all sounded fun, but also so scary.

So I took a gram of phenibut and 4 grams of kratom on a whim, having experimented with them (but with lackluster results) a few years before. I hoped that this would calm me down.

It did more than that. After an hour, I was in a state of pure, absolute bliss, only heightened when my girlfriend arrived and we explored my town together and talked about anything and everything. We'd done this many times sober, but this time I was floating on a cloud. I felt like I was on hydrocodone -- and yet, I felt completely and fully in my right mind. This was like being sober, but so much better.

I don't know if I've ever felt happier than that one night.

Driving around through the cold air in my warm car, soaking in my warm kratom glow. Talking to the girl I was falling in love with. Wow.

Well, as it usually goes with these feelings, I wanted to feel that way again. I usually have a problem with letting good feelings go; I had a bad habit of getting blackout drunk every weekend freshman and sophomore year, as well as smoking copious amounts of weed. I guess I should've known I'd be predisposed to falling in love with an opioid. 

I continued to use kratom whenever I saw my girlfriend, as the combination of being with her and the alkaloids in my brain gave me a higher high than I could ever experience by myself. I never told her, yet I justified it to myself by telling myself that it was natural; it was like I was drinking caffeine. It was like I was sober.

I thought it would just be for that break; it was basically vacation, meaning that it wasn't real life. I would stop once school started again.

And I did...sort of. I dropped my intake by a lot, only using once a month if that -- but then summer hit, and I was back at it again. 

I hung out with her sober quite often, but the times I did use kratom were usually when I was with her. I'd throw eight capsules down my throat 1/2 hour before she'd arrive at my house, or me at hers. It was so comforting. Like a safety blanket. And though I'd fallen in love with her in our time together, I'd inadvertently fallen in love with kratom right alongside her.

School started again, but kratom didn't stop. I continued to use until it bled into every aspect of my life, and it became an everyday occurrence. I lost weight, as I starved myself all day so that my doses would hit better.

Eventually she found a bag of it and confronted me. I told her that it had been a problem for me for a while, and that I'd been trying to quit, which was true -- I've had a few attempts in the past. I told her I'd quit.

That was one year ago. I still take kratom everyday. I've never told her that I continued to use it. I've continued to hide it. I don't know what the fuck's wrong with me.

Almost everyday I feel consumed with guilt about lying to her, about the way my kratom use began when her and I began, about being addicted to a nasty-tasting plant, letting myself fall into this hole, about probably destroying my microbiome by never eating anything, about spending hundreds of dollars a month on it, about lying to my family, about performing poorly at my first out-of-college job because I'm always on kratom, about never wanting to have sex anymore because it destroys that drive.

And I feel like I can't talk to anyone about it. It's all bottled up inside. I feel like I'm going to explode. I don't know what to do. I'm so afraid of telling her, of letting her know how much I broke her trust.

And as weak as it sounds, I'm so afraid of quitting, of never feeling that soft glow in the back of my head ever again. Of stopping my daily pursual of the feeling I haven't had since that night two years ago.

I successfully quit vaping last year and have only touched it once or twice since; but something tells me this is much different. The comfort and love I feel when I take kratom is nothing like nicotine; the associations I have with it overpower everything.

I know I'm never going to grow as a person if I keep this up. I know I need to quit. Today I didn't take any. I felt awful. I don't want to take any tomorrow either. But I don't know if I'll be able to stick to that goal. I'm very convincing to myself. Cravings seem to always own me in the end.

I want to do this for me, but I also want to do this to finally start telling the truth to my girlfriend. To never have to lie about not being hungry again. I love her and she doesn't deserve to be with someone like that. It makes me cry thinking about how awful I've been.

We'll see. Sorry this is so long. I've never told a soul about my problem, and I needed to get it out somehow.",11,0

So mad at myself. I keep falling into this trap over and over again. This addiction has brought me to my knees and demolished my self-confidence.

I was consuming 60 to 70 grams a day throughout the day.  I consume it several times a day and could not make it even a few hours without more.  I think this has been ongoing for 5 years  I would take pills with me to work or hide a bag of kratom in my sock or pocket.  I had dust all over my cloths and new car.  I carry a backpack of kratom powder with me in my car, and we ALWAYS take my car.  I hid it from my wife, kids, and friends.  Occasionally, my wife would find my stash, but I never told her what it was.  No one knows I am fighting this addiction. For months and months I have been praying to quit.  

A couple of months ago, I went to confession and owned up to the use to the priest.  I told him it has been and idol to me.  It interferes with my relationship with God, and everyone around me because I am constantly thinking about it.  I literally schedule my life around it.  This was a big first step because it got me serious about quitting.  He asked if I have told my wife, and I said ""no"".  

The taper was going ok.  I immediately reduced down to right under 50 grams and scheduled set times I was allowed to take it.   I have been increasing the times between consumption and decreasing the quantity by about 1 gram a day.   I have more or less stuck by the taper schedule.  But it sucks and I just want to rip the band-aid off.   I am at about 40 grams a day right now.   

Several days ago I was at my kids basketball game.  It was halftime, so I snuck out to the car to take some.  Well, I didn't get back in time.  I missed my daughter's basket.  She was so excited and I was not there.  It really hit me hard.  I knew I could not continue 60-90 days of this which was my taper plan.  

The taper is not easy for me.  I lie awake for hours every night.  I still feel discomfort.  I still have itchy skin.   I am still restless.  I am still short of temper.  My family notices I have not been the same since the 1st of the year.  I just cannot see continuing down this path.  At the end of the taper I still have to jump ship.  There will never be a good time to do this.  

I was lying in bed two nights ago and couldn't sleep.  I grabbed by phone and looked at my schedule.  I own my own business and am extremely busy until after Friday morning.   I can take Monday off and next week does not look too bad.  I asked myself ""if I am not sleeping anyways, why not just bite the bullet and do it Friday?  I want to quit.  I don't want this in my life.  I want this over with as quickly as possible.""   I also remembered going on vacation without it a couple of years ago, and it was not that bad.  I just felt sick.  I still did activities.  I was not depressed.   I think I was even able to sleep.  I was not ready to quit at the time.  I have wished for years I had not purchased more after that trip.  

This morning, I was again disagreeable with my wife.  I called her up after she left the house and told her there was something I needed to discuss with her tonight.  It would explain my mood and what was going on with me.  She tried to get me to do it over the phone, but I would not reveal what the discussion was about, except I am not dying or anything like that.  Tonight I come clean to her.  I am embarrassed and disappointed in myself.  I can't believe I even have to put this burden on her and my kids.  I was trying the taper to lessen this burden, but months of this seems worse.  I want a completely sober life.  I have been praying for God to help me and to help them.   

I have gathered all my kratom and plan on destroying it.  Friday morning will by my last dose. 

The purpose of this post was twofold.  Firstly, I am doing it to help keep myself accountable.  I have not increased my use from my taper even though I know I need to go CT.  I am scared for Friday to come.  Secondly, I wanted advice.  Has anyone here messed around with starting a taper and then went CT?  Any advice would be appreciated, except I don't want to continue with the taper.     

TL;DR

Two week mild taper and instead want to bite the bullet and go CT.",13,0

Every time I withdrawl it gets worse I swear. I heard every time you get off opiates it gets harder? Why is this green powder kicking my ass SO HARD. I was at 60 gpd( at least maybe more I wasn’t keeping track) and now I’m down to about 15 after three days. And I feel like absolute hell. Anyone else experience this?

Suboxone and methadone were the WORST lasted about 9 months of absolute agony but kratom withdrawals feel the same, honestly. and it’s making me panic. RLS is worse than ever or am I just making this worse in my head? I swear some of my withdrawals were so traumatic I can vaguely remember them to be honest. One day at a time I guess.

I had relapsed chronically. 

First, I can relate to the panic and stress I see in the posts from people worrying about WD. It is real, and I'm not trying to minimize it, but I will say - dreading withdrawal is a trap! It will not be nearly as bad as you expect. Try and carve yourself out some time and space for the worst of it. Kratom makes you stress and dread and swirl on things. It becomes this gigantic beast you fight off because at the first sign of WD you take another dose. 

Life is so much better now free of kratom. I say that as someone who once thought it was my savior and solution. I'm a brighter person to be around and I'm happier. I still get periods of intense euphoria, but now from everyday life. I couldn't invest in that life when I was on kratom all the time. I still get cravings but really broad ""I want to feel different/better"" ones versus super specific opioid cravings. I have found an in-person support group to be extremely helpful and the difference in keeping me on track.

I successfully quit for 65 days.  

I relapsed for 3 weeks while dealing with a nasty sinus infection and headaches.  Relapse dose was 5g 3 times a day at the end of the third week.

Using hydrocodone rx taper to help me quit. 
Day 1 - 7 pills (7.5 mgs)
Day 2- 6 pills
Day3- 5 pills
Day 4- 4 pills
Day5- 3 pills
Day 6- 2.5
Day 7- 2
Day 8- 1.5
Day 9- 1 pill
Day 10-half pill...tomorrow is Day 11 going to jump.

Results-  It has been about 30 days of opiate use during the relapse, my use has been controlled and kept as low as possible.  Withdrawals during taper have been occasional light headache and low level anxiety , little bit of insomnia.  Withdrawals increased when I got down-to under 2 pills a day.  So far pretty painless but the real battle starts today, plan to use a few Imodium for diarrhea/withdraws for a couple days and take an ambien for sleep if needed.  Dependence rebuilds very fast if you have been a long time 7 year user like me, even trying to keep usage very low,it builds fast.  I don’t recommend people relapse, not worth having to deal with the entire quitting process, if I did it all again, I would just try and deal with the pain and not use kratom.  I hope my journal is helpful for others going through a similar situation and trying to quit.

Update:  Took my last half pill of hydrocodone yesterday; day 11 without kratom today...only thing I am noticing is some anxiety all day, unable to relax, going to go to the gym now and took 2 Imodium to deal with diarrhea .  Hopefully the anxiety won’t last as long this time since I only relapsed for a month. Good luck to you all.",1,1

I've been trying to go to sleep.  I can't stop thinking about all the things I've wasted.  

The very first and most important as my daughter.  She's only seven.  I haven't been patient with her.  I have an emotionally been there for her.  I physically been there but that's really about it.  When I first got sober years ago I had so many big plans for us.  I just realized the other day she doesn't even know how to tie her shoes.  I've missed that point where I was meant to teach her that.  She is getting older and I really can't even remember how it happened so fast.  I've been walking through her most precious years in a kratom haze.  I wonder what she would say if she understood what is actually happening.  When I get sober I'm going to owe her for the rest of my life.  I would give absolutely anything to go back.  

I am actually at a point where I can see how kratom is affecting me in everyday life.  I can see it in my responses to anyone that tries to communicate with me.  I'm looking at them but I'm not listening if that makes sense.  I want so badly to feel connected and what we are talking about in some way.  I can actually visibly see people giving up while they are trying to explain things.  I can see the difference in how often I think about them.  I hardly think about anyone anymore.  I've become so selfish throughout my addiction.  It's always been about my problems.  What I didn't realize until just now is that all of those problems stem from my addiction.  I bury my head hoping it'll all go away and it just gets bigger.  I wonder what my daughter thinks when she looks at me.  I can't even look at myself anymore.  

Sometimes I'll have flashes while I'm falling asleep at night of the person I used to be.  I don't know if I'm building her up in my head but she was pretty fucking cool.  People used to tell me I should be a stand-up comedian.  I couldn't even tell you a knock knock joke right now if you asked me.  I can remember the way but I used to feel about my friends and my family.  The way I used to feel about my boyfriend.  It was with my heart.  No I really only feel fear and sadness.  I hardly have feelings anymore.  I want to feel them all.  Kratom didn't take all of these good things from me, I did it.  I let myself believe that I was capable of using just once.  The saddest part is this is the third time I've done it.  The third time I've repeated this shity cycle.  It's so funny the things that you hear in AA or so true.  This is the definition of insanity.  How do I change it this time?  How do I make sure that I never fucking come back here?  I hate what I'm doing to myself and to my life.  I hate what I'm doing to other people's hearts.  This is the hardest thing I have ever had to do.  Addiction doesn't give a fuck who you are.  It doesn't give a fuck who you love or how many people love you back.  If you are weak enough it'll drag everyone down.  It's not just me it's everyone else that knows me.  Does anyone have any advice as to how you keep from relapsing?  I'm sick of talking about withdrawals and how sorry I feel for myself.  I just don't ever want to be back here.

I am doing pretty well with my taper, not as well as i had roadmapped, but i didnt plan on it to go as expected.

As of now I am down to 4.5-5g/4h.

I completely stopped taking Maeng Da(all colors). A huge part of the depression onset/mental withdrawal i realized was from dose to dose withdrawal due to the alkaloid profile of that kratom.

&#x200B;

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~A word of caution to anyone quitting/about to quit/start tapering, AVOID THE FK OUT OF MAENG DA, use balis, this will reduce the craving and inter-dose comedown and w/d by i would say 2X!!!\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I am taking red bali right now and plan on using this strain and brand exclusively throughout my taper.

&#x200B;

Over the last 6 months i had gotten to a point where i HAD to take kratom very 2.5-3h to avoid the nasty mental comedown and what i felt like was the onset of physical W/D(which i now know doesn't start till at LEAST 4-5 hours after last dose, for me anyway.)

&#x200B;

Today, For the first time in over 6 months (that i can remember) i actually forced myself through the nastiness of the mental feeling of doom and gloom and couple odd hot flashes to make it past the 4 hour mark and hit 6! I also realized that even red maeng da causes this feeling/initial dose comedown almost 2x as intensely as red bali!! It was amazing to feel almost trippy in a sense, like i had been rewound, emotionally speaking, almost 2 years and felt NEARLY normal for the hours past the 3 hour mark.

Im a huge gamer and have been taking kratom while gaming, especially the one ive been playing a lot of recently, Planetside 2(massive mmofps faction\_V\_faction\_V\_faction tactical combat sim) I really fell back in love with this game in the last week or so and have put in nearly 32 hours!(time flies earily fast when on kratom, ESPECIALLY maeng da)

Im really happy for this because this is a game i have played and really loved on and off since launch in nov 2012, i feel like its something i had long before i started taking kratom and its something i can carry with me, its also a tactical shooter not a twitchy one so i do not at all crave the cognition enhancement kratom provides, in fact im starting to dislike it because the hours playing PS2 fly by so fast its really hard to form any good memories  or memorable moments which SUCKS.

&#x200B;

Emotionally i feel like kratom had me trapped in this little tiny room that slowly got smaller as the effect wore off, but i realized I WAS keeping myself in that room!!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

anyway, ill stop harping on, GOOD LUCK TO EVERYONE IN THE MIDDLE OF QUITTING, YOU CAN DO IT!!!

One at lunch and another before I’d head home so yeah I’m a pretty decent user of kratom , a typical dose for me was 3-4 teaspoons . I made the jump off the stuff 10 days ago . The first 5 days were fuckin awful . I didn’t want to work or workout and I couldn’t play with my kids which was the worst part . I had zero energy like every muscle and joint in my body aced . Sleeping was terrible only getting 4 hours , the depression was something I’ve never experienced before and that is no fun . I’m ready to start feeling like my old self again because this sucks . The last year my Conscience was nagging me every day to stop this shit and man up and quit but the little bitch in me always won and I took the easy way out  . There’s this guy on YouTube he’s an ex con his channel is called GP-penitentiary life . He gives solid advice on how to live your life vice free and it motivated me to make the jump off the stuff .

But for addictive personalities like myself. It nearly is ruining my life.. Sad to say, I have been using it for 7 years.. on and off. until the last 2 years, where I have been consuming almost 40-50 GPD, sometimes, even more. Gotten to the point where my wife sees the difference on my appearance and my personality. I have tried quitting cold turkey, but it only lasted 2 days lol.. right? The restless legs, the yawning, the shits, the cold sweats and the dullness got the best of me, so like an idiot. . I hopped back on the kratom train and kept using! Well.. Im so so so sick of using this bullshit, but honestly, I cant quit. To be honest, Before Kratom came along, I was into painkillers and other things I don't want to mention. And one day, went to rehab. Came back out, than a friend of mine introduced me to this magical powder as he called it. Said it was completely harmless.. well, its not on my behalf. I took 50 g's today. Not proud of it. Not proud of having to plan on waking up every morning before my wife and kids wake up, just to hide the fact that I need to take a dose of kratom to fucking function. Not proud that, every 2 to 3 hours I have to take another dose.. and than another. and than another.

Before that I had woken up one day and decided to quit, but only made it a little over a week. So i started using again for about a month. Besides feeling WD while dosed, I was feeling a lot of depersonalization leading up to that day where I reached my breaking point. So I had quit and made it about 8 days then started using again. Funny thing is, on the day I relapsed I woke up feeling amazing for the first time, I was riding a natural high. And on that day when I used, I didnt even have an enjoyable experience while dosed. But i had broken the momementum and fell back into the cycle. I started to get the same depersonalization and feeling like I was WDing while still dosed, about 20 days back in the cycle, so I realized its time to quit once and for all. Currently on day 6. Im starting to get back into daily routines and what not. Been doing cold showers and practicing the wim hof method which has helped a lot. The breathing method particularly got me through my 2nd WD, but during this WD I got a bad respiratory thing going on so i havent been able to do the breathing exercise as much, but i have been using at least once a day. Cold showers have been my savior so far. I havent had much socialization this week but will have a band practice tomorrow so hopefully that help bring myself back. During the WD Ive had severe depersonization, but im slowly coming back. I want to relapse but I know that I dont have a choice. I cannot be dosed and WDing at the same time while at a gig. I know if I hop back in the cycle itll lead to the same spot. Anyways, I wanted to ask you guys what your breaking points were like? How did you know that the cycle of addiction no longer could go on?

Ill probably make another post about the Wim Hof method in a few days. It is definitely very powerful at changing your mental state very fast. And also there is a a ton of science to back up why it works. I definitely recommend going down this rabbit hole!",3,0

352,2020-01-13 16:48:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/eoayux/day_31/,Day 31.,"Wow.  I can't believe I am saying it: day 31.  To be 100% honest, it has completely flown by.  I went from being at 2+ years of on again and off again kratom use.  I would take it daily, and in high amounts.  My typical dose was anywhere from 30-60gpd.  I sometimes would dose once a day, other times multiple doses a day.  I would abuse for several weeks to months and then withdraw.  Each one being a little different and worse.  I would say this latest one ranked about a 6.  It wasn't the worst, but it wasn't certainly pleasant.  This one has lingered more than past withdrawals.  I keep worrying I am somehow permanently harmed myself.

Let's start with the bad news.  I still find myself lazy and uninterested outside of work.  I come home, get comfortable and hop in front of the computer.  I have no interest to play video games and generally waste the time watching YouTube and reading about things that interest me.  I just go exploring.  I work weird hours and recently moved to a new town, so I have no friends or things to do.  On weekends, I basically bunker down.  Luckily, the weather has been pretty shitty, so it works.  

I did have some drinks recently and all it did was make me feel like shit.  I found no pleasure in it.  I started getting a headache.  I only had 3 craft beers when I said I couldn't do this anymore.  I ate some edibles and went to sleep.  I woke up a little hung over feeling.  Not too bad.  The previous weekend I did something similar but it was a little more enjoyable when I drank.  So drinking sucks even though a few beers use to be nice.

I feel like all my interest, time and energy are used at work.  That energy does not translate when I am home.  A few things typically happen when I do get home.  I stay awake, hit the vape a few times, listen to music and read.  Nothing major happens and I go to bed just fine.  I stay awake, hit the vape a few times and get extreme anxiety.  I spend the next 2-3 hours in anxious hell and then try to sleep but sleep doesn't come and I finally sleep but only for a couple of hours.  I will come home and lay down in bed because its just so comfortable and I will fall asleep and nap for an hour or 2.  This causes me to have trouble sleeping later.  Right now I haven't sound some sort of system that seems rewarding and fun.  I generally feel my best and relaxed on Friday and Saturday.  I don't feel the next day of work looming over me and I can catch up with friends online playing games and on Discord.

There has been some depression kicking in.  I went from having loads of energy and confidence to where its back down a little bit.  I don't feel exhausted but I feel a little depressed with varying levels of anxiety.  I definitely feel down.  That kicked in sometime this weekend.  I feel like my chemicals went one way and now its coming back around.  By this weekend it will probably be back the other way.

The other thing that has taking a weird turn is my libido.  When I came off kratom I was extremely sensitive there (I am a guy.)  It was a like a whole new toy.  It was INSANE how different it felt.  That seems to be evening out too.  I never feel disinterested in anything sexual, but I have found myself having those thoughts and I almost to begin to dread it, which is insane.  I know its a temporary feeling.  I know it has to be over my general health.

The positives are endless: more energy, better skin, better eyes, taking better care of myself, better gastrointestinal, peeing better, saving money, not being a zombie, actual interest in things, etc.

I think around day 45 I will be feeling a lot better than I do now.  Not that I don't feel much better, but where I feel like I have completely weathered the storm.",13,0

In the end, I took about 16-18 grams daily (6-8 g morning + 8-9 g evening) for about a year. I was switching between green and red strains, sometimes whites, but I like the reds the best.

I was taking kratom to reduce anxiety and allow me to work and then to sleep. I am a quite neurotic person with workaholic tenedencies, so kratom really hit the spot for me. I was never addicted to any drug (I experimented with many recreational drugs except opiates/opioids). With kratom, I found the unicorn.

I decided to quit cold turkey during Christmas holidays since I planned to be alone for the whole week and I wanted to save money and finally be free of kratom that now took too much of my time and resources.

I was prepared for 3-5 day withdrawal and thought I should be normal in 7 days or so (now I know it's BS...). Week 1 was pure hell, no sleep at all, just rolling on the bed and walking around and sometimes being on the verge of crying. Week 2 afforded me some sleep but I still had hot flashes, cold sweats, and enough RLS to sleep only every other night very poorly (4 hours at best).

Now week 3 was much better and I was able to get 4-6 hours of sleep every day.

The lack of normal sleep and being groggy all day every day, the RLS, the endless twitching of legs and arms (and even abs!) - all this drove me so crazy I eventually took 4 grams of Green Sumatra before bed...

...and of course, like a miracle, the RLS immediatelly stopped and I was finally able to lay calmly after so many days - I immediately dozed off like a baby and slept for full 9 hours, then felt absolutely gorgeous the second day. No signs of RLS, no twitching, just pure calmness and energy.

So of course I repeated this for the next 4 nights, but in the fear of withdrawal, I decided to quit again.

Indeed, now I am in for a second withdrawal, having full blown RLS and can't sleep for a whole week AGAIN. It's not as bad as the first time, but I sleep only about 4-6 hrs every other day. It's really frustrating.

I tried all kinds of remedies like the hot/cold showers, massages, sleeping pills (Ambien - 10 mg), loads of magnesium, loads of Valerian root... Nothing truly helped me so now I became desperate.

I plan to start using red strains of kratom again but just before bed and just enough to fall asleep. Hopefully, if I gradually reduce the dose, it would be possible to quit completely without too many sleepless nights... I hate being dependent on a substance, but I think believe it's still better than not having a single good night sleep for over a month, which is much more detrimental to the body than using a little kratom.

Note: I am a very poor sleeper and even before kratom, it normally takes me several hours to fall asleep (I couldn't sleep at all during some nights). However, I never had RLS before... that came to me after the withdrawal and this one symptom somehow refuses to cease.

Have been lurking for quite a while, and have definitely been inspired by many of the stories here.

Some back-story: I started using Kratom roughly one year ago, primarily using liquid extract “shots” (the K-Shot was my demon). Got addicted fairly quickly, tried MANY times to quit (including a period of time in intensive outpatient), and relapsed each time. Finally decided enough is enough, and my last use date was 7 days ago. 

To keep me accountable this go-around, my wife purchased a huge box of at-home instant UA drug tests for Kratom. Her intent was to test me at any point, any time of day, and if the test came back positive there would be hell to pay.

The issue I’m facing is that, even after 7 days, I showed positive on the Kratom test this morning. I know there are plenty of articles on the web that mention it could be as long as 9 days for Kratom to be completely eliminated, but obviously when my wife sees the positive drug test her instant reaction is to believe I’m still using. What really terrifies me is the occasional stories I’ve heard on these boards of people testing positive for Kratom up to a month! If I’m anywhere even marginally close to that, I know for a fact that my wife would never believe me.

TLDR; is there any actual scientific data supporting Kratom staying in someone’s system longer than 9 days? Are there any simple/easy tips for eliminating Kratom more quickly?",2,0

Had to put down my dog 5 months ago and welcomed my first child 3 months ago and I think I'm just now dealing with the emotions. Kratom had blunted me. I thought it was my safe harbor from life but all it did was stall life and let emotions build up. Dealing now with mood swings and sadness over having given 18 months of my life to this. It's like I've been underwater all this time and just surfaced. As hard as this has been, I will NEVER go back to that way of life. I feel alive now.

But I’ll take this over how I was feeling the last two days...days 4&5 I woke up, despite having slept, with the most crippling depression and anxiety I’ve ever felt. Even exercise did not improve it. I cried half the day, had some really negative thoughts and thought a lot about relapsing just for some relief (did not). I’m wondering if it has any link to being two days following taking trazodone, and if anyone else here has experienced this? I had it prescribed when I was getting desperate off little to no sleep those first few days, even with helper meds, but i just find it odd I felt like that the only the two days I took it. I never even felt that low in the middle of acutes, any quit. It’s odd since it’s technically and anti-depressent (but commonly prescribed for sleep) But maybe could have a negative effect in someone not needing it (Ive always been prone to anxiety but never depression).

I’ve been using some of the recommended supplements, I think BSO, high dose vitamin C, and CBD have helped the most. I also used gabapentin these first few days, no more than 1200mg a day but usually between 600-900mg. Going to not take any today and see how it goes.

But im kratom free, and feeling strong on that front. (I also told you all i was going to take a break here, but im not stable and was on a ""good feeling moment"")

Ive brought this up with my wife tonight and last night. I really really want this quit to stick. Really do. I dont want to replace highs, and sure dont want to use kratom ever again. Has anyone done one on one drug counseling? I dont think i want to do AA or NA. 

Im not a raging addict. I drink, consistent, but never get wasted, just 3-6 drinks normally a night, maybe 7 or 8 on a heavy night. Its rare i get wasted. I only have a hit or two at night of weed. I always have a heavy stash, but i use for sleep aid and have forever. Weed is no issue. Then there is kratom and pills. Kratom obviously was heavy n consistent, with 3 day pill binges every 2 weeks to 3 months inbetween. Never constant use, but 60 mgs of oxy a day for 3 days at a time when i spurt. In younger years i dabbled with everything but decade or so in the past, but thats no issue.

Ive just never been sober at night, since i was like 17 (im 33 now). Now last 4 years, ive never been sober in the day. First booze habit increased momentarily, then kratom overcame that....so sobriety feels weird. 

I know my danger zone. Its now through forever. This one has to stick. I am growing mushrooms, and am planning a focused healing trip around day 30. No idea if this will help. Havent done mushies forever. Could help or not. 

But, has anyonw done counseling? I can hold a job. Never gone a day without work since i was 16. I dont have bad tendiencies to keep my addiciton going. Never had to do anything bad to get a fix or anything. Its not like that.

Im just wondering if this helped anyone with long term but ""minor"" addictions over come this? Or are they all geared towards tweakers, needle pushers, and full on addicts?",3,0

Also some self-reflection (kinda long),"Last night was pretty bad with the anxiety and rls but  I'm doing the best I can. I got a bunch of supplements like hylands, magnesium, melatonin, epsom salt and even tried Irish Spring out of desperation but the rls still kept me up for much of the night. I did eventually manage to get some sleep so maybe they helped a little.

Before quitting I was taking a very high amount daily for years. At my max was like 75 gpd. Over 2 weeks I tapered down to 22gpd and jumped from there. Looking back I should have tapered longer but I started feeling bad WDs and got impatient and said ""Fck it I want this to be over with"". It sucks cause I have like $200 worth left that I will have to dump but that's how it goes.

Now that I'm in the middle of the acute symptoms, I'm reflecting on why I am here suffering and also trying to look ahead. I remember when I first started using kratom years ago I felt it honestly gave me benefits. I found it helped me with intense studying when I was finishing my bachelor's degree and it gave me a sense of well-being and energy. But as I got hooked by taking it daily and and needing more and more, those positive effects gradually diminished and the negative ones increased. It took over my life, even altering my appearance from heavy use.

My main reason for quitting is I noticed really dark sunken-in eye circles that wouldn't go away no matter how much sleep I got or how hydrated I was. I was looking at recent travel photos and it looked like I had 2 purplish black eyes as if I got in a fight and I was well-rested. There could be other factors involved but I suspect it was from kratom abuse because it was the only substance I was taking. Also I required a dose to get motivation to do anything. Depending on a substance to be happy in life is not the right way to live. I blame myself for allowing this to happen.

So I'm trying to think of how I will cope with the world without depending on this substance and still have a sense of well-being. Being happy while sober is going to be a new challenge for me. I have a very addictive personality (also having suffered from alcoholism before) so I think it's a much deeper issue that needs to be addressed. I suppose there is an underlying issue for all of us as to why we start using substances. I have a general anxiety disorder and was on some anti-anxiety meds before that I think helped me, so maybe I should get back on those in the near future. I didn't realize this post would be so long but I just wanted to get my thoughts out. Maybe someone out there can relate.",7,0

Told myself I was going to start a couple days after thanksgiving and absolutely fucked that up, getting to almost a month of time until I realized everything was falling apart and I needed to take this shit seriously. 

My first jump sucked, but I powered through, took some comfort meds, and my body had a relatively easy time adjusting until I got to the under 10g range. I’m sitting at around 4g rn, and I’m jumping when the shit runs out regardless of whether I lower the dose or not before then.

I did speed things up, but all of a sudden it’s become a whole different thing. The lack of sleep, the muscle soreness, the general feeling of flatlining. 

Don’t get me wrong. There are so many plus sides. For instance, I have an appetite and I’m feeling more present then I have in a long time. I feel motivation to do something besides get high, and it hasn’t been like that in years. But it feels like life is behind this depressing empty filter and I can’t crack through to what it used to be like. I’m experiencing periods of normalcy and balance, but also periods of things feeling so muted and dull and hopeless it’s almost unbearable. 

I can’t stop now. I’ve legit put my life on hold to do this taper, that hasn’t been without consequence. I’ve lost a lot as a result. But I was heading toward losing more if I didn’t cut the brakes.",5,0

I’m 11 days out and worn pretty thin. My life feels sorta out of control and I think that now that kratom isn’t clouding my vision I can see the turmoil that was prompting me to use more clearly. 

I know this forum isn’t really about that, but I think it has to do with grief for my grandparents and 2 pets I’ve all lost in the past 3 years, along with my partner being diagnosed with a brain tumor. I know there is no excuse for using, but it’s nice seeing the reasons more clearly, even though they hurt.

I am so inspired by everyone on here. It seems people are really hard on themselves for using. I think you all are tremendously strong, and even though using was not / is not the right way of coping, the things you all are coping with are tough and deserving of attention, and beating yourself up over your mistakes doesn’t help. Try to be kind to yourself today, and everyday, which includes staying the fuck away from kratom.

And you all have helped me more than any sub ever has. I've been considering dosing for work because it has been hell due to my anxiety, irritability and emotional instability. Clearly I'm desperate and struggling. So here it is...

Started lamictal 6 months ago, my psych prescribed it off label for anxiety and depression. It didn't seem to help my anxiety but, shockingly enough, over time (adding in here- after the first month or 2 of kratom withdrawal) my intense depressive episodes were nearly gone... I was more level headed emotionally. (I had the depressive episodes prior to kratom as well).

The last 2 weeks, and especially the last week, have been really bad.

My anxiety: tremors, tightness in my chest, hot flashes, constant sweating, nervousness obviously
Depression: this one recently caught me off guard. Last week I had a couple bad episodes, but it happens every now and then. The last few days, however, I've broke down crying every day. Today it was about random, stupid things. I was like a 2 year old who didn't have her nap.

I'm under the assumption I need to come off of lamictal. I'm afraid if I increase my dose the same issues will occur in the future.

Was going to do a night dose last day to help me sleep but I had a rough week and just decided to hop off and deal with it. 

Supplementation has been vitamin c and magnesium. Did Epsom salt cleanse to clear my bowels, and niacin flush because it has always made me feel better in the past. felt better after both of those. 

Kratom helped me quit drinking, I have no regrets as I’m not sure where I would be if I hadn’t used to quit what was becoming a troublesome drinking habit. But it started making me anxious and WDs were coming in between doses for the first time in the last two weeks so I figured it was time. I still have full stash in desk drawer but won’t touch it and will likely flush it next time I’m in there. 

WD have been alright, but I enjoy a challenge. Only thing that has really sucked has been rls, which was expected. Slept last night for about 5 hours which was a nice relief from little to none on the first night.

Had an amazing workout this morning. Like unreal, felt like I was 18 again. I feel my testosterone is rebounding hard. While on kratom I couldn’t exercise much longer than an hour and never had a great workout. 

Two things I am realizing were heavily muted while using are music and sports. I have loved both most of my life but have lost interest of late. Really enjoyed music today and am loving the football game at the moment. 

I built my company and did a lot of other things that were productive while using. I can not wait to see what lies ahead being free and clear. Thanks to everyone that has shared, it has been helpful.

Today, I woke fragile, achy, tired and depressed. The magical relief of last night was temporary. It was a brief reprieve brought on by a short boost in neurochems from working hard and interacting. 
I do realize human contact and simply being busy makes some of the worst parts fall into the background.
I'm sad. Im rueing my ex. On top of that I'd been seeing a girl I liked for a month or two and she called it off this afternoon.

*“Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”— George Santayana*

# 90 DAYS CLEAN FROM KRATOM / GREEN MALAY

I don’t think I could have done this without this Reddit quittingkratom community. I went to NA meetings but those pale in comparison to being able to read and interact with individuals going through the exact same tribulations as you. **Going on here and venting when things felt hopeless ALWAYS turned my day around in a positive, uplifting way.**

In conjunction with the support on this forum, I am not sure I could have stayed this strong without my parents and my girlfriend. If you are about to quit Kratom, I believe it is imperative that you locate people in your life that you can come out to with brutal, humbling honesty about your situation. Bring all of the darkness into the light so it cannot survive. If you struggle with self-love like me, you will need the accountability from others. So if you fail, you are failing them too.

Thank you God for this day. It can be easy to forget how things were in the past and it can be easy to overlook the successes I have had. It is a sucky truth to being human but the mind tends to focus on fixing the “negative” things. I woke up this morning focusing on my “negative” physical sensations… a weak stomach and with a sore neck and sore back muscles.

Although it can be easy to get caught up in current nagging issues, I still haven’t forgotten the experience of quitting Kratom cold turkey. I can mentally take myself back and vividly remember the days where my body was as cold as death, aggressively shivering with 24 hour goosebumps, coupled with inescapable misery - crippling anxiety, panic, loneliness, emptiness and hopelessness.

My minute to minute existence was pretty much fear and anxiety. I remember desperately looking for ways to get out of the house to feel alive. I distinctly remember venturing out and going to a big church just to be around friendly people. I can take myself back and see myself sitting in Mass just staring off into space, feeling like an empty shell of a human being; a vegetable.

I remember the never ending onslaught of anguishing thoughts and rumination. There was no sign of these feelings letting up. All I could do was cry. I would weep in my car, I would weep at home, I would weep in church. I remember the gripping feeling of hopelessness combined with feeling physically like I was dying, shaking and shivering from being cold despite being blanketed in layers of warm clothing.

**What helped immensely was finding this Reddit community and learning how bad Kratom really is.** It is not a sustainable supplement by any means. It deteriorates your health. I tried to get into a local detox program but the professionals were ignorant to Kratom. It didn’t even show up on a urine test. They didn’t take it seriously and didn’t return my phone calls.

**Reading the misfortunate tales from others about nasty Kratom reinforced my decision to get this crap out of my mind and body for good.**

I remember the early days of quitting when my fragile mood would completely drop into despair out of nowhere. I remember crashing on my girlfriend’s couch, tossing and turning while drenched in sweat. During (and well after) my DIY detox nothing made sense in life. I would describe it as waking up on an alien planet with nothing but memories that could not be validated. My mind was unable to reassure me. Reality was slippery; it was an identity crisis. The only thing that made sense was getting the number of days to a bigger and bigger number and clinging on to hope for the notion that I will be able to experience joy and calmness again.

**I remember my immune system crashing three weeks after quitting** and becoming the sickest I have probably ever been in my life. I was violently coughing for three weeks straight. I had different sicknesses in sequence (the flu, then a cold, then a cough etc.)

I remember the pink elephant honeymoon phase when I was floating on a cloud with euphoria with my “new lease on life”. I remember this phase sharply turning into post acute withdrawal which was very discouraging and confusing (this is when the quittingkratom community really got me through). I remember these symptoms going away only to come back strong for 20 days straight once I passed the two month mark. This has been a bitch of a ride that I will never allow myself to experience again. To have to go through this again would be a waste of life.

This experience has opened my eyes to how much I was putting off feeling emotions and numbing physical discomfort with substance abuse. It has also opened my eyes to how important it is to be able to produce dopamine and serotonin in your brain by natural means.

**Being high does not enrich your life experience, it robs you of it**. I am coming to terms with how much of a blur the last three years of my life have been. Substance abuse makes me a distracted, distant, self-serving person with misguided goals. Sobering up from being saturated in these opiate alkaloids has been confusing and emotional because I have all these memories that seem unreal because I feel like my “Self” was not there to experience and process them. It's freaky.

**Substance abuse delays fatigue. It takes away the control and insight you have into your own body, which ultimately causes chaos and turmoil in your life.**

I used Green Malay as a performance enhancer, physically and socially. I used Green Malay to circumnavigate boredom and challenging emotions. I thought I was taking a shortcut. I believe the reality is that I was stockpiling these things into a separate compartment in my body. Eventually the compartment begins to overflow and the compartment door threatens to burst open. The substance can no longer put things into the compartment because it is full. I found myself in a situation where I was using the substance just to keep the compartment door shut and eventually it can no longer even do that. The door bursts open and the stuff I was stockpiling flows out. I then use the substance to pick up the stuff and try to put it back in the compartment while other stuff is tripping me and making me fall on my face. It is at this point that my life becomes a dysfunctional hell… mental chaos and turmoil.

Acceptance and complete brutal honesty must occur. I learned that my worst mental states are when I feel like I am not in control of my life and I am not reaching my potential.

**I am 90 days free from the tentacles of Kratom and I have no desire to ever go back.** I still shop for groceries in the area where I bought Green Malay and I drive by the place often. I don’t have any temptations. I visualize myself in that store as a weaker version of myself. Thank you God for allowing me to get 90 days of distance from this substance and this self-destructive behavioral pattern. Thank you for reading and thank you to the people who contribute to this forum.

And god it felt good to sleep and get the time going.

Today I’m steel feeling some effects from the benso so I’m actually feeling quite good, still some body aches and RLS but it’s manageable.

So for all of you struggling, try to get some gabapentin and melatonin, gabapentin works wonders for the RLS and overall feeling and melatonin for sleep, and if these don’t to the trick try some benzo (when it’s getting unbearable that is)

And remember this is for you guys out there who just can’t quit without any help from other medicines, if you can go through it without it so go for it just don’t cave in. Better to take other substances than relapsing IMO, just don’t take any benzodiazepines for more than 3-4 days a row so you don’t get addicted to that. 

I know it’s hell but if you can make it, if you do you can really be proud of yourselves, this is a HUGE accomplishment. The struggles is real and it sucks. 

Also agmatine can be used to make the withdrawals easier. I have been using them since I started quitting. For me they didn’t do so much, maybe a little – like getting my mind more focused.",7,0

I've been exercising everyday (lifting weights and exercise bike), to little degree of relief.

The biggest thing preventing me from just quitting is the anxiety, and it is persistent. No matter what I take (that i've tried) or do will help. I've drank beer to help, nothing. All it did was got me drunk. Not something I enjoy doing anymore anyways. I've also tried 1.5g max of phenibut (not daily), it helps but still feeling like crap, and akuamma.

I've been taking it everyday for two months (the kratom). My dosage for kratom is usually 3g at a time, taken twice a day. 3g in the morning and 3g at night weighed out with a scale. 6g a day total, as I find any more than that has no effect at all. It's not a terribly high dosage like some people. I've heard of people taking 30+ grams a day, that's freaking insane. It is still causing me extreme discomfort. I'm planning on reducing that to 2g at a time tomorrow, to cut back on usage. It might be too fast though, and if it is I will try 2.5g at a time instead. I've noticed the period of relief in which i dose kratom is getting shorter by the day. So quitting soon is essential.

I've been researching other supplements that might help. Cat's Claw and Black Seed are the ones i'm most interested in. They seem to help a lot of people quit. Would these help my case? I do not want to go the prescription/pharmaceutical route, as I want to keep it as natural as possible. Don't want big pharma taking my money or life. So no Naltrexone or naloxone, although I may consider it if nothing else works.

Cannabis is not an option. I live in Oregon (a legal state), but in a group home. It's just not allowed here until it is federally legal, even then I still have to get a medical card (can't do it recreationally) and is unknown what the rules/stipulations will be. I love weed, but sadly is not an option right now.

Any suggestions for me? Have you found a supplement that helped or is helping you quit? I know exercise can be a big help, but isn't enough for me. However, I will keep doing it. Some tips for quitting would help too. I am open to any advice given

Information about me if it will help: I am a male, 25 years, 230lbs, 5ft. 11in, Asian (dominant)/Pacific Islander/East European descent. Disorders: Asperger's Syndrome, Major Depressive Disorder, PTSD, ADHD, Social Anxiety and GAD. I take these recreationally and medically: Kratom, Kava, Frankincense, Myrrh, CBD, Catnip, Lemon Balm, Caffeine, Nicotine (Vape) and sometimes but not often, marijuana, Syrian Rue, alcohol and phenibut, history of recreational drug use (5 years clean at least from all of these): Dextromethorphan, crystal methamphetamine, dextroamphetamine (Adderall), methylphenidate (Concerta, and Ritalin), focalin, methylin, cocaine, lorazepam, zolpidem, oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine, Salvia divinorum, LSD, and LSA and inhalants. The psychiatric meds I take daily are, effexor xr (Will be switching to Trintillex soon due to the many side effects), Buspar, Clonidine and Risperidone. these are the herbal medications I take to counteract effexor sexual dysfunction: Horny Goat Weed, Maca, damiana, velvet bean, panax ginseng.

Update 1 (1/10/2020 4:08PM MT): I ordered some Cat's Claw Extract on Amazon just now. Will report back to this post on effectiveness to help others quit too! Also I forgot to mention that I have some of the strongest Kava (The Loa Waka from Kalm with Kava) on the way. It's not here yet, so I haven't tried it. I take Kava very often in capsule form, not traditional brew, I was taking a break from Kava. I heard it is far more effective this way than caps, will try soon and report back",1,0

409,2020-01-10 16:28:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/emxi5q/my_story_advice/,My Story & Advice,"First off I just want to say thank you to everyone here. I have been an on and off Kratom addict for 5 years. This reddit has been a lifeline for me during the three major CT ""quits"" I've endured. I am on day 5 of the third and I feel like it's time to give back if I can help anyone with my experience.

My history: Quit CT during a 7 year Oxy habit twice, ended up on Suboxone and quit CT  after 2 years, spent 3 years clean from opiates and turned to Kratom recently... With all of that said, Kratom withdrawals DO suck and, in my opinion, Suboxone is never the answer for quitting Kratom. Suboxone does have a purpose of getting people out of their illegal drug buying routine but quitting was horrific. 

Today marks day 5 clean from Kratom, again. I have always loved drugs for enhancing everything so tapering properly has never been an option. This time around I've been taking anywhere between 10-15 50x extract pills per day. The day before I quit I just took 30g leaf as a SUPER short taper for reference. Here is an account so far for those that are going through hell as I could never seem to get enough of it myself:

Day 1-3: Time stops. RLS, trouble sleeping, stomach is a mess, uncontrollable thoughts of cravings and depression. I forget what I've learned every time: It's going to be over before you know it. 

Day 4: Physical symptoms feel manageable. Sleep still sucks, brain still feels depersonalized and I fear going into public but it always helps when I do. Beginning to do things around the house and have regained my sense of time. During the first couple of days I literally lose my typical queues like, ""Morning is usually when you eat, walk the dogs, etc."". I just feel lost in a hellish fog. But that is gone today! Again, It's over before you know it. 

Day 5: Tired but everything is manageable. When I think of cravings now, I can dismiss them. This is impossible in the first few days. Huge success.

This is the point where I realize that I will make it to the next step: never going back when I feel healthy and strong again (the ultimate goal). It's always about day 4 or 5 that I remember the same thing every time. It hits me that all this suffering is akin to an alter-ego is being ripped out of me. Someone who isn't me. Someone who has been controlling my thoughts, turned me into a liar and had its claws burried DEEP. This is obviously a metaphor but it's incredible once day 4 hits how I can't even relate to the way I was acting on K, or the plotting I did just the day before to get more. I have my morals back AFTER THREE DAYS. I am me again, which brings me to my advice:

DO NOT PUSH OFF QUITTING BECAUSE OF FEAR. Some of these accounts can be super scary. I am guilty of convincing myself (or at least Kratom convinced me) not to quit because I didn't have enough time off, I had to see family, etc... It honestly IS doable and the biggest victory comes after only a few days. You will remember who you are again. You will ""wake up"" as so many people put it. Yes, there are still symptoms after only the first few days but they all seem manageable at that point. For me, and everyone is different, after getting three or four days under your belt you begin to develop tools that make the situation winnable.

Take a short time to prepare. 

Get a week off of work. This feels impossible to some but doing so is more important than living life as an addict. 

Tell someone you love, friend or family, what you're doing. It is incredible when someone is in your corner.

Give all of your keys, money, debit cards to someone else who will not give them back for a week. 

Stock up on food, vitamins, chocolate, whatever. 

Set up a counseling appointment with an addiction specialist for a week after your quit date.

Find something like a new video game or a book if that's your thing that normally you can't put down. During withdrawal, nothing seems fun but the things I normally can do endlessly are the only things I can do to grind the time away. 

Eliminate any chance of getting Kratom and quit. Don't keep trying to taper if you know you can't do it. If you can, I am rooting for you as well.

&#x200B;

Just remember, it might only be a few days before you really FEEL that you're on the road to success. You can do anything for a few days with the proper preparation. It's never as bad as your ""evil Kratom mind"" makes it out to be. Love you all. YOU'VE GOT THIS!",11,0

Day 1: Jumped CT after 2 1/2 years, approx 40 gpd but probably more near the end. I was having trouble this time around w/cravings getting to me and relapsing after a couple of days, so this time I decided to experiment with low dosage of Naltrexone.  I do NOT necessarily advise this for everyone! Research, research research! And talk to your doctor first,  if you take too much before 7 days it can put you in the ER with precipitated withdrawals. However, after a lot of preparation (see prev posts for more info), and loading up on helper meds, I took 2mg every hour for about 3 hours, and 4mg 3 hours after that. Got horrible RLS but other than that it wasn't that bad. So all in all, I was in relatively mild precipitated withdrawals. Sleep was shit but got maybe 4 hours. I should also add, I vaped some indica oil and it actually made my RLS/anxiety worse! I felt like I was in a nightmare, my whole body had RLS and felt weird. I was so thankful when it wore off. I don't know if it's just me tho, sometimes I take edibles for sleep but lately I have found I don't like how I feel with THC. I've tried various CBD products (oil, edibles, tinctures, vape) and it doesn't do a thing for me.

Day 2: I still had the usual discomforts but pretty mild, more equivalent to what I would expect around day 5. Took about 7mg naltrexone and felt fine, took 7mg in the evening. Absolutely NO cravings which is incredible and worth it all for me. So I think I succeeded in accelerating the acutes. Mostly having body temp issues/chills, some mild stomach issues (won't go into detail) but have some helper meds. Hardly any sleep.

Day 3: Plan on taking \~14.5 mg naltrexone in a bit. Still no cravings. Physically feeling better, still have the chills but the absolute worst thing right now is the insomnia. I got 1, maybe 2 hours of sleep last night, even with some helper meds that are supposed to help and have in the past.  I feel like I'm losing my mind. I'm going to the walk in clinic later to see if they can get me something like Ambien. Anyone have any recommendations? I have to go back to work Monday and I'm really afraid I won't be able to function if this continues like this. Depression is also pretty bad but I think its mixed in with the lack of sleep. I feel like I'm losing my mind, but I think I made it out of the worst and see the light at the end of the tunnel. Thank you all, this community keeps me going.",1,0

Well I came in for 3 days and freaked out and left because my withdrawals got so bad. Dumb choice obviously because I only prolonged my suffering. I’m going back any day now and I WILL NOT leave no matter how bad it gets. I can’t I don’t have an option. I’ve got to get off the shit. Kratom got me off heroin and benzos five years and ago, and I’m gonna be the bitch that is going to say that Kratom withdrawal can even be worse than those two substances. Benzo withdrawal was one of the worst I’ve ever been through, but I didn’t get the constant RLS which to me is the absolute worst thing in the world. I wish there was some way I could avoid it. It scares me seeing people on this sub talking about crazy RLS that doesn’t go away. How long did the RLS last for those of you that successfully quit? My dose was about 60-80 grams a day before I left and I had been using extract shots on top of the plain leaf. Since I’ve been out of rehab I’ve been taking on like 25 grams a day. I’ve been out for a week and I cut down drastically very quickly and haven’t had any issues of feeling withdrawal off this taper so far. I’m just scared to go back to rehab, I won’t have my phone to distract me while I’m laying awake all night. They don’t have baths which are the only thing that helped my RLS In the past. No music, which is my therapy. And no helper meds either. I had to get off my gabapentin when I went in and I don’t have anymore. They won’t let you take gabapentin there. I thought I was having withdrawals from both and that’s why it was so bad but I literally don’t feel any gabapentin withdrawals so this was ALL Kratom basically. Do you know how embarrassing it is to explain to a bunch of people you know (local treatment center and I’ve been involved in recovery for a while now) that I was using Kratom the whole time i was in “recovery” and the reason why I’m pacing back and forth all day like a lunatic is not because of anything other than KRATOM. I am shocked at how bad these withdrawals are. I went to rehab a couple years ago to try to get off Kratom and lyrica which I was taking at the time instead of gabapentin. I believed that Kratom withdrawals were non existent and I thought the whole thing I was experiencing was due to the lyrica. But it’s identical to what I experienced this time. I was still struggling so bad on day 30 and I relapsed right when I got out. I think my RLS had subsided by the third week but the anxiety and insomnia were very much there. I don’t think I can do this but I have to do this. I want to put this shit down. I’m just terrified it’s gonna be really bad for months. I’ve never been off Kratom longer than a month a half, I relapsed when I got out of that past treatment center very quickly because I was still having issues sleeping and with severe anxiety after 30 days!. If I’m still struggling that bad after 3 months I’ll have to get back on it, even though I want to be free of it so bad. Idk what to do.. I’m gonna try to continue to taper down before I go back in. Maybe get down to like 15 grams but Idk how long I have and if I’ll be successful going down any further. Any stories of successful quitting or encouragement? I could use both right now. I need to know people can and do make it through this.  Wtf is Kratom literally.. my addict brain wishes I went back to heroin instead. But that would obviously be very shitty because I probably wouldn’t be alive today. I would so much rather detox in my apartment and be comfortable but I know that’s not an option because I will only make it 24 hours and then redone. Helppppp I’m scared :(",1,0

She flipped shit wanted to leave me the day I came clean to her and was I promised I am quiting but she wanted nothing to do with me but use me. I managed to quit that day and she stayed with me for 4 more months, until after Xmas last year and I baby sat her cats during a cruise she went on.. And she met a dude the cruise, just about a year ago to this day. She left me a second time the day she returned and I slowly started my kratom habit back, managed to quit it for a month near the start but went all in by summer. 
I haven't spoke or seen one friend of mine in months, nothing yo no one. 
My dad has ALS. 7 years in and not good. I have taken leave time for being one his caretakers from the job I've been at almost 11 years. The moment I had no more work obligations Monday did a pathetic taper of one spoon Monday night to sleep. Then one spoon to help with house chores Tuesday morning and haven't touched it since. Soo almost 3 days tomorrow morning. 
Make matter worse my dad didn't want his feeding with the feeding tube today and went on hospice thud afternoon. Might not want food again and told my mom this morning that he said he wants to die. 
Since I've been in withdrawal I haven't been taking care of him as much past few days and letting my brother and mom pickup my slack. They understand what I'm going through, nobodys told him and he should not know I'm a addict. 😭

All I want to do is dose since hearing him say he wants to die, going on hospice and stop eating. Or I almost want to tell him I can't have him die right now or I will start dosing kratom again. I need him. He told me last week when I was still high happy and and still all sorts of taking care of him that he has this... Now I haven't been there for him he wants to die. 😭",2,0

So my last dose was Monday night. Made it through the the first day, and boy did it suck. Usually I feel fine on day 1 and the worst physical stuff hits Days 2-4. However, because I'm so afraid of relapse (the cravings always get me, this is my 7th or 8th attempt and quitting) I decided to use some Naltrexone as an insurance policy. After researching and reading through many accounts of precipitated withdrawal I realized it would of course be stupid to take a full dose of it before 7 days. However, I dissolved 1/2 a tablet (25mg) in 250 ml of water, did the math and 2 teaspoons equals about 1 mg. I waited to take it until my other meds kicked in (gabapentin, ibuprofen, tizanidine) and then took 2mg every hour for 3 hours. I definitely felt it, it was the worst RLS I've ever had, but I didn't get nauseous or have any other horrible symptoms (although the RLS was like a nightmare). Later in the afternoon, I decided, what the hell and took 4mg. Nothing got worse but the RLS was still horrible. Tossed and turned all night but was eventually able to get about 3 hours sleep. It sucked but I made it through. And most importantly, absolutely no cravings which is incredible to me.  This morning, did the same of loading up on my helper med, and this time, cut down a pill without putting in water, and took approximately 7mg about 30 min ago.

about 3 years and its gotten to the point where
it doesn't give me that talkative energy feeling
anymore, it doesn't help as much as it used
to with anxiety, but it still has its painkilling
properties. I wake up multiple times a night
feeling like im suffocating and restless legs
from withdrawal so I have to redose every 4-5
hours. Whenever I run out of kratom i have
extreme mental breakdown, Flu Symptoms,
RLS, I became extremely moody and feel like im
dying, the pain is unbearable. I would rather off
myself. For Long-term high dose users kratom
withdrawal will feel as bad as heroin withdrawal,
Stopping cold turkey at this point is pretty
much unbearable/impossible without the use
of drugs like Methadone and Benzodiazepines.
Trying to taper off never works for me because
whenever I feel depressed, anxiety or pain I 
relapse. Tapering down slowly from the massive
frequent doses I take would take months to
complete and measuring all those doses is very
time consuming.

Oh I forgot to mention because of kratom abuse
I now suffer from adrenaline fatigue.

Kratom saved my life but now its ruining it.
I used to have adhd and was very outgoing
and now I'm very quiet and tired all the
time, I started using hard stimulants like
amphetamines and meth to compensate for
the adrenaline fatigue, I can't focus anymore
without stimulants, I'm always zoned out and
my reaction time and spatial awareness has
gotten a lot worse.

I constantly cry about how I miss what it felt like
to function like a normal human.

I'm Looking into rehab but kinda scared. I dont
wanna get locked away and detoxed, I just want
methadone just to ease the withdrawal hell

I just want to add that I suffer from borderline personality disorder which was caused by being in extremely abusive relationships, I'm a wreckless mess  and I have no self control. When I first started taking kratom it actually supressed a majority of my bpd symptoms. Sadly it doesn't anymore so I've been getting worse and worse. I believe that if never started taking kratom I would have never started using meth and other stims. I really feel like I need stimulants to make me feel alive again.

I took it for 4 years and quit because my libido and erection quality tanked in November. After I quit kratom it was even worse. My man member was like dead. Even Viagra didn’t help. Now I have been working out a ton over the last 45 days and I just had my testosterone checked yesterday at 473(still waiting for free testosterone results to come back next week). My T in September was 181 so it has gone up a lot since then. I have kept track the best I could of nocturnal erections and I have had them about 21 out of the last 25 days and they are full and ready to go. The only thing that bugs is my day time erections are not so great. Sensation is more than it was a month ago. It gets up easier too but requires a little extra work and even then a lot of times it isn’t hard enough for sex. To me kratom in the right dose was stimulatory for sexual desire and feelings but then it didn’t work anymore all the sudden so I think my body is trying to regulate after quitting. The waiting game just sucks big time. I guess my question is what is the longest you have heard of people taking to recover sexually from kratom use? I have heard from a few days to a week to some people taking months. I have never had one single craving for kratom since quitting and it wouldn’t be bad if I wasn’t in a relationship but we haven’t been together for almost two months even though we have tried a bunch of times.

Ct 3 weeks away,"I was at up to 35gpd in the summer. 4.5 year habit. 35yo. Had years of suboxone then 11 months clean then started k. I havent been doing a good job at tapering, it’s hard for me. I been using kratom I set aside over the years I deemed not as good. 

I already have the day picked out , feb 2nd will be my first ct day. I hope I’m below 10gpd by then. Then I’m traveling out of the country for 3 weeks. I hope by day 6/7 I can tolerate such a long flight. 

My quit kit has a lot of supplements mentioned on here. A pound of buffered C, ashw, bso, akuamma, I get rls and anxiety about 12h after dosing. My use has been about 5-6x per day with 2-3g doses. I been using more capsules which is better to taper with. 

I fear I will have such a hard time and when it comes to the travel I may opt for more capsules. I sure don’t plan on it. I want to pay my debt and get on with my life. I know kratom has negatively affected me deeply, probably more than I can realize now, but I know it’s made me less social and has made life dull. It still has benefits like getting me moving in the morning, feeling some energy for 30 min after a dose (then dull).

I began the habit due to moving to a new place I didn’t know anyone and the depression and uncertainty surrounding that. The energy boost and antidepressant effect was nice. For the first 2 years I kept use below 5gpd. 2.5 years ago I had gone down to 4 capsules a day.. I was so close. 

I’m just telling my story. I think I’ll be posting a lot during my quit . I been collecting positive posts from here for myself to read when in wd; also trying to come up with short sentences to maybe print out and it be visible when quitting, such as “if not now, when? This is our only good chance” “I agree to be miserable for days/weeks, I don’t expect any pleasure , this is my time to pay the debt “

I think because my relapse was so freaking awful and exhausting, there is a chance that I have a much better idea of what I'm going to do to myself if I start using again. Right now that thought is revolting.

I do use medical marijuana and definitely a little too much. Going to try and quit that too down the road. For now I want to distance myself from Kratom as much as possible.

2) The fog is gone. My brain is beginning to come back to reality. I can’t explain how great of a feeling this is.

3) Driving to work with the music on is the best now. I’m feeling human, so I groove. I always loved EDM, then it got really dull. Now my love has returned.

4) At work, I’m laughing...smiling...actually being able to converse without Kratom. It’s amazing looking people in the eyes again. I’m energized. I’ll tell you what I take down below. 

5) My RLS is starting to fade. The legs feel calmer than the days before. I’m able to rest comfortably. I do have a twitch in my arms/hands and my feet still twitch, but it’s not too extreme. It’s getting better.

6) I never had high anxiety....until Kratom. It’s fading. I no longer breath heavily when something irritates me. Maybe nothing was worth being irritating in the first place... I had two panic attacks in two weeks recently.

7) My appetite is back full swing. I no longer need to wait to eat, or not eat at all, to take Kratom. I get hungry, I eat. I’m eating salads at lunchtime, and my girl is cooking gluten free meals for dinner. It’s a great feeling to eat and not think about Kratom and when I can take it and feel it.

8) MY SKIN. MY HAIR, MY EYES....all look incredible today. No more dark circles under my eyes. My pimples are gone! My hair feels soft! 

9) I can “feel” again. I numbed everything all the time with Kratom.

10) My libido is coming back..... fast..... 

11) I seem to be able to taste things better.. idk if that’s because of Kratom?

12) No more itching... do y’all notice this?



>>>Supplements I take:

1) Emergenc-C packet for breakfast. 2 bottles of water.

2) I have low mg CBD gummies. I eat (3-5) 3x a day. Another glass of water with each dose.

3) I take Bayer Back and Body Extra Strength twice a day, usually around 10am and 6pm. Bottle of water with each dose

4) I take Epsom Salt baths at night... this is helping me the most I believe.  

5) I take 2mg of Melatonin and then lay in bed with the TV on. When my eyes start to close, I turn the TV off.

6) I put Icy Hot with Lidocaine on my muscles when they twitch. This mainly happens when I’m lying in bed, due to me having a physically demanding job, I don’t notice the RLS at work.

    Negatives are still there... it’s a cloudy walk in the park.

1) I still have RLS. It’s not totally gone. Might be a symptom for quite some time. The ticks I notice are after work when I’m relaxing. It gets worst if I think about it. It sucks bad...

2) The anxiety, it spikes... mainly because of the RLS, or if one of my machines at work keeps failing and I have to fix it repeatedly. I have to walk away... and breathe.

3) Sometimes the Melatonin hits me late... so I’m up til 12:30 waiting for my eyes to close. Might try a pitch black room tonight. I’m not sweating though.

4) My hands are freezing, all the time.

So to end, I can see hope. I’m never going back to K again.

Good luck with tonight everyone. The days get better.",6,0

Ive been having more cravings but still resisting but im really running out of reasons to not dose. I feel like I could continue life without it with just accepting everyday pain and feeling slightly uncomfortable everyday and being a less than perfect partner to my loved one but id really rather enjoy life with kratom like I had been but I dont want to depend on it especially to not get to the point of dosing three times a day 5g per dose.  I feel fine and normal but I rather feel great you know what I mean?

I quit Kratom after taking it occasionally for 6 Months an then 3 Months daily ca 10 gpd with a few breaks. This doesn't sound like a long time and high dosage, but exactly for that reason I want to encourage people, who may read this and aren't sure if their use is problematic yet, to quit as early as you can. Even I consider myself as very addicted and still after 17 days I feel awful. I also wanted to share what helps me with my PAWs. Because I am a Tea enthusiast I drink a lot of tea everyday. If you have typical symptoms like lethargy paired with a restless feeling I recommend to drink Pu Erh Tea. It's a tea from the teaplant (camellia sinensis, just like green oder black tea as well) It is known that some Teas have a strong mental effect, often described as a meditative state. It's the only thing at the moment that really helps me to feel good even if its only for an hour or two. If you are interested in trying this tea (it's extremely delicious for me but not for everyone) make sure you get really high quality ones because only they will have a nice body effect. You should search for Raw (Sheng) Pu Erh which is made from trees that are old (Gushu)  and preferably growing wild. In my experience teas from [www.pu-erh.sk](https://www.pu-erh.sk) are very good but you also find a lot for example at [www.yunnansourcing.com](https://www.yunansourcing.com) or [www.meileaf.com](https://www.meileaf.com)

To explain the effect on the mental state through tea, it is often referred to the L-Theanin in the Tea Leaf, but i don't experienced any comparable effect when taking the supplement. High Quality Pu Erh is expensive and you should make sure to check out how to brew it right. There are also some Japanese Green Teas that have a nice effect on me like Shincha or Gyokuro.

Thank you for sharing your storys, it helped me a lot!",2,0

So I was once at 120gpd and have been tapering off and on for a few months. I have fallen off my wagon more than once due to rl stuff. Am currently at about 18gpd (3 doses of 6g). Tried tapering with 20% daily drops and it sucks having strong WDs for days and weeks on end, even with helper meds like benzos, CBD, or cannibus.

It works for some, but for the rest of us I say take a break every few days: I now drop about 1/2gpd and do that for 3 or 4 days or until the WDs just get too much combined with rl. Then I stay at that dose for a few days and give my brain time to catch up.

So far, that, more than any single thing, has helped me stick to my taper. I initially tried to jump 3 to 5gpd, but after a week or so it gets overwhelming having strong WDs each day and I would slip.

It sucks, and is slower, but the secret is reframing it mentally: you are managing it instead of getting managed by it. Every day you have to get up and face the fact that you are an addict. That's ok. It means you have done and seen shit that only addicts have done and seen. These experiences give you the edge you need.

And your addiction gets up each day ready to kick your ass, so you have to be prepared to ""feed the wolf"" each morning and fight back. It is a battle of sorts in the battlefield of your mind. Addiction wakes up, gets dressed, loads it's guns, and waits on you to wake up so it can jump on you as soon as your eyes open. 

You are still stronger and much more of a warrior than kratom is. Every teardrop and cramp is just another nail in that addiction's coffin and you WILL win. No highway option. We will fight tooth and nail. Bring your a-game because addiction sure as hell does every freaking day.

No one should expect this to be easy, but it is possible, and therein lies hope.

Good luck and (source of your choice)speed!",9,0

Probably about 60 Gpd and been using about two and a half years. The place I've recently been getting my kratom from gave me some really really bad k last time I ordered, and I don't have money for more. Absolutely no magically feeling from it, and I desperately need to quit anyway so I'm using this as an opportunity. The last week or so I've been waking up all night sweating, waking up early as hell every day, low energy, serious fatigue all day, anxiety, depression all the typical symptoms. So I'm ready for a taper. I've never measured my doses. I just eye ball the spoonfuls and toss and wash that shit, but I figure if I'm already going through what feels like withdrawal, I might as well use this as a spring board into my taper. My question is, how exactly do you guys taper your dose? I've never measured my dose and I'm not sure how I would even go about doing that. Do I logojust put it on a scale go weigh it and that's my dose? I have a gram scale but it's not an mg scale,does that make a difference? What about a taper schedule? How much should I drop and how often? I've heard anything from one gram a day to dropping s couple grams every few days after the body adjusts to the drop. What are y'alls suggestions to this? 

I'm having kind of a hard time with the withdrawal, and they're not even super bad since I'm still getting some weak kratom in my body. I work a pretty physical job and work pretty long hours so I can really afford to do cold turkey. I mean if what I'm feeling now is with me still getting kratom into my system, I can only imagine going cold Turkey.

I've been ready to quit for a while but I've been afraid of withdrawal. I've hyped myself up about a taper before, but obviously without weighing the dose that's really hard to do, and I either cave or I just stop worrying about it. I'm ready to do this shit now. Kratom had began making me depressed, destroyed my sexual life and my energy levels and mood in general have taken a huge dive. Thankfully I haven't started fucking up at work and totally screwing my life up yet, but I'm definitely broke all the time bc I spend all my money on kratom and I'm worried my life is going downhill too fast...

I appreciate all the responses I get, and thank you guys. If you have any personal experience feel free to send me a message. I could use some support through this process and you guys seem like a great group of people!",2,0

But with the mentality that I couldn’t go back I stuck through it. Valerian root and melatonin helped a lot with the sleep. I feel much better about the state of my relationships, I want to do stuff again. I was recently told by my psychiatrist that I likely have an unofficial but appropriately named condition called Alexithymia which means Im bad at identifying, feeling, and communicating my emotions. This meant my stress anxiety and fears all backed up and lead to serious issues. After quitting I had a clearer image of my emotions and was better equipped to identify the issues.
The most difficult time after acute withdrawal was the temptations to just have a dose. I had to go on vacation with my family and my mother is an addict to the wretched witch. She had a total of half a kilo for a week. I very easily could have snuck some and not have to worry about the anxiety and stress that was plaguing my mind. Each case where I was tempted, I knew it wasn’t an option. I wanted to justify it, but I chose to stop myself from even considering it further. Walking to a separate room helped.
I still have a lot of makeup work to do. If you saw my first few posts you’ll remember that I quit during finals week after already having a lot of make up work. I think I’m in the clear for the most part, but I will stand guard and always remember why I quit. Temptations will come and go so parry her calls by responding with the reason you quit your affair with the wretched hag. I have hope to see a time when my addiction will be nothing but a distant memory and a indicator of my character.

Took my last dose on Friday around 4pm, and stuck out everything cold turkey quitting can throw at you.  In the middle of another relapse that started yesterday, and despite dosing two times in the morning I still experienced RSL and arm syndrome while sitting in my cubicle...  Anyone else here that can share a similar story or scenario?  I kept my doses very low, and decided to not take anything home with me in the evening.  Gabapentin and clonidine have been a huge relief at night, but it is becoming increasingly harder for me not to reach for a dose during the day.  Work is a huge trigger for me.

2 months ago I took a trip to austin. I had been sober from drinking alcohol for 3 months, and I wanted something to do at the end of the day instead of sample all the good local beer, so I looked up a kratom store and started back on the same path.
I'm up to 75 grams a day. It's been less than 2 months.
Today I slept thru a job interview. I was constantly sleeping thru my alarm years ago when my habit was high. 
I'm no longer getting that great feeling, but I'm redosing to avoid withdrawal symptoms.
I'm hoping if I stop today I wont go thru the hell of withdrawal i experienced in the past after long, heavy habits.
I'm gonna try not to dose tonight, and if things aren't too bad tomorrow, I'll continue cold turkey

ALOT!,"   Well I started a taper last october. I was at 45 gpd. Got down to ten. Started drinking and took more during a hangovers but steadily stayed at around 10 to 15 gpd. Kratom helped me immensely in the beggining and for years it was sheer joy, energy, sleep, positive mood. I could type a novel on my kratom journey. From quitting with pheibut, then relapsing, then becoming heavily addicted to both, but I just wanted to cut straight to the point. I started using capsules to help taper. I was at 20 capsules a day (10 grams) then 15, then 10, then 8, then 5. I would usually take 3 weeks before dropping so it's been a process. I was on 5 capsules a day for 3 weeks. I was only taking 2.5 gpd and still have complete apathy, disassociation, anxiety from hell, fog, and other ailing issues. Kratom took my soul and my health. I take the blame for this and should know something that makes you feel this great is toxic. Theres was a point where I couldn't process simple thoughts. My weekends were ruined by the anxiety of work. I was and am sick. 3 days ago I started taking black seed oil and only bringing 1  .5 gram capsule with me to work. Black seed imo has helped me the most. I've felt hope, smiled, and have had a positive attitude latley. I used to read reddit and buy any supplement that people suggested. I wasted a lot of money with little results. I feel better now than I have in a year. Today I made it through 10 hours on half a gram and will make it through the day taking a gram total. My heart goes out to anyone dealing with this. I wanna troll the kratom thread so hard and warn people. I started taking kratom before it was huge so there wasn't much literature out there other than it's like quitting coffee. It's not, not in the slightest. I wish someone would have told me this 10 years ago. A human being should not feel so lost, sad, and hopeless as I have.I was addicted to oxy contin and this isn't much easier. Anyways likeI said I could write a novel about this addiction. It's different for everyone but kratom had me by the soul. I wish you all the best of luck and please try black seed oil. You can find some videos on YouTube with info on people alleviating the sickness with it and it has helped me a lot.

For those of you just starting out, don't see any of this as discouraging. My life is much better than it ever was on Kratom, good luck on your journey, and you can make it through the acutes, all you need is support, and the will/desire to actually return to sobriety.",17,0

I am back after two failed attempts to CT. I made it about 6 days both times.

Man, I wish I would have known how hard it is to get this stuff out of your life. It’s sneaky and disgusting, and I want to be free so bad.

Today is day-6 for me with the exception of a one time mess-up of a teaspoon on day 4. That teaspoon made these wds way worse; caused crazy cravings the next day and really bad anxiety. I’m counting it as six days because it’s motivating for me, although I know it’s kinda cheating. 

My partner uses it and that’s a huge trigger for me. I need to get it out of the house, but I feel guilty about that, which I know is crazy. Any words of support on approaching that conversation from people who have done it?

Anyway, day six is way better than any day so far, and I can feel myself waking up from the haze. It’s crazy how suppressed and numb I was and still am. All the things I loved lost their color and flavor. I want them back... and my sex drive, and my hair and skin. So many reasons.

467,2020-01-07 10:34:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/eld1in/my_bout_with_kratom/,My bout with Kratom.,"Hello, I'm going to keep this as short as possible so I don't burst into tears again for the hundredth time this week, but don't feel like you can't ask any questions. I'm posting here to obviously help everyone in the grips of Kratom.

My father passed away 4:32pm on January 3rd from a heart attack and lack of oxygen to the brain from said heart attack. He went out with a Morphine drip to make sure it was painless and quick. He was 66 years old.

My father had faught heavy anxiety most of his life -- driving more than like 20 miles from home, hosting holidays, social gatherings, etc. would put him in a very bad place emotionally and mentally. His heart and mind had some inner demons for which he had been prescribed Lorazepam for most of his life. He had apparently been taken off Lorazepam, not sure if it was willingly or not, but he had been taking Kratom due to, and this part hurts the most, my recommendation...along with a few other friends of his approving its benefits. I just wanted my father to feel better, for he is and was the greatest father a man could ask for -- the most unselfish, helpful, loving father in the world.

Doctors said there was no blockage of the heart. He was taking, according to my stepmother, upwards of a cup a day...which is roughly 200 fucking grams a day. Now, I'm not sure if this is 100% true, because what someone consumes daily is hard to know unless you are with them at all times, which he had a job and such...but even if it was half of that....he would still be at 100 grams a day. Their deduction is that the Kratom had caused the heart attack and because no one was around to get help right away, he went too long without oxygen to the brain, and at that point even if they had brought his body back to life, his brain was too far gone.

So much for brevity -- fuck it. Well, my wife and I stopped taking Kratom the second we found out what they had thought was the cause of the heart attack -- cold turkey, which was January 1st. I was at around 10-20 grams a day and my wife was probably around half of that. We had been taking it over a year. Day 1 actually wasn't too bad, we were a little tired and sore, didn't sleep a ton, but the worst was probably probably days 2-4, as we were crawling between the bedroom and the dining room, trying to feel better, being super lethargic, anxious, and sore. Obviously, we were also going through some pretty bad shit with my father in the grips of losing his life, but it didn't help detoxing off kratom as well. My wife got RLS worse than I did, while my sleep was worse than hers. Day 5 was uneventful, which was a blessing in it's own right, but then day 6 was a terrible day for me -- sleepwise, as I may have only gotten like 2-3 hours of sleep in 30 minute increments. I'm writing this as I lay in bed, having just woken up from the longest night of sleep in a week...day 7 has been the best I've felt since quitting kratom and facing the reality that my father is no longer a phone call away. I know there will be good days and there will be bad days, but after reading all of your experiences with this green powder, I know what to expect and not to ever think that I'm ""over"" the whole thing. 

If anyone is curious, my wife and I have been taking CBD tinctures and capsules, along with me smoking a few hits of marijuana at night, water, I exercised a few days in that span (Ring Fit Adventure for any of you Nintendo Switch owners out there), and some ibuprofen in the first few days. We are being mindful not to just trade one crutch for another, though I do trust CBD and marijuana substantially more than Kratom.

Also, my father's heart and any other organs they think were affected by Kratom use is being sent to a research institute to be examined and studied for better awareness, which is all I could ask for -- other than my father's life back. My father was the only one I felt 100% comfortable calling at any hour of the night, due to my own anxieties. I knew that he knew how I felt about it all, for he had been through it and probably worse than I ever had. The world got much scarier for a few days, knowing I didn't have him to confide in and make me feel comfort. We hosted Thanksgiving this year for the first time ever, and my father comes in, instantly could tell my anxiety was through the roof, put his hand on my shoulder and just said, ""You're doing good, Josh."" I'm starting to tear up now, but I felt the weight just fall off my shoulders right then and I just smiled, as he knew how I felt. I'm beginning to ramble, but I just wanted to paint a picture of my father -- perfectly imperfect. Didn't want anyone to have more than two pairs if shoes on the entry rug, sometimes got riled up over the most trivial thing, and couldn't drive more than 20 miles from home without taking something to numb the demons in his brain, but he was the most jolly, loving, and selfless person I've ever known.

To end this post, I want to extend my gratitude to all of you for sharing your stories and experiences, along with sharing your constant battle against Kratom. I'm a firm believer it's never the drug's fault. No -- I'm not mad at Kratom itself. I'm not mad at the manufacturers, the vendors, or the abusers, just mad that I have been stripped of all the life and love that I, and everyone else who knew my father, have lost. He was battling his own inner demons for most of his life and now I find myself here, without him, trying to find solace knowing his heart and mind are finally at peace.

I'll leave you all here with this anecdote about a woman sitting by her husband's bed, moments before his passing. He says to her,

""Remember this, always.
Each morning, the moment you take your head off the pillow,
You have all you need.""

My memory is shot, my hair is falling out. I have no muscle tone, no strength. I'm tired all the time, and I'm breaking out. I might get judged for this, but I am going to use Suboxone (very small amount) so I don't go through withdrawals.

I don't have anyone in my life to hold me accountable, so I'm posting this here. It's difficult to go through a secret battle like this alone.

 So, basically I've been taking kratom for about 11 months now. For the longest time Id take 3-4gs once a week with phenibut on my days off to relax. Then I stopped using phenibut because it was making me to lazy, so I could get more done. So I started using kratom strictly once every 3 days. Now I was taking it alone, 3g in the morning and 10g at night.  This eventually lead to 2 days on, one day off same doses. I went into withdrawal from that schedule and just stopped right there and then so I wouldnt worsen the habit.


  Then I went back to my once every 3 day schedule and stuck to it with ease, no craving or any of that. But I decided then after reading all these reports of people claiming the dependency was worth it and all that. Me being very ADD and lethargic and kratom being the kryptonite to these issues I figured it would be worth the daily habit so did research on how to taper off and etc... and jumped in head first. In the beginning Id do my normal dosage of 3g in the morning and 10g at night, but realized my tolerance would be destroyed attempting to maintain this with daily use. So i cut it down to 3g in the morning and 6g at night, then finally 3g in the morning and 3g at night. 


  This went on for quite some time then I started to notice interdosal withdrawal after around 6hrs, but with the aid of magnesium and excessive hydration the symptoms were barely perceptible and I kept on this way until the interdosal withdrawal got worse and I ended up  dosing 3 times a day, once every 6 hours. This is when I realized it was becoming a problem and decided daily use wasnt worth it so I started tapering .25 every couple days, and only dosing twice  a day. I got to 1.5g I started knocking it down steady at .25 a day until I got to .5g then I did that for a few days until 2 days ago, taking .25 the past two days. Now its my day off and I havent dosed for 18 hours.

  To my surprise, interdosal withdrawal feels much worse than this. All im noticing is some lethargy, brain fog and some chills in the morning which was easily counteracted by caffeine, hydrating, magnesium, turmeric, agmatine, L tyrosine, and B-12. I also have weed and kava for any sleeping issues that may arise, but I always go to bed in withdrawal so Im confident it won't be an issue. This leads me to believe that all the shittiness I was feeling in interdosal withdrawal was mostly psychological, because I was just craving for my next dose. Because all though I dont feel as good as usual, this is nothing compared to what I felt during interdosal withdrawal. Im not sure if the bulk of it hasnt hit me yet, if its all of the supplements and other aids  (forgot to mention Ive been working out and microdosed some mushrooms today as well, which could be contributing) or the very drawn out taper plan that's making this so easy but regardless I'm pleased and this will be a breeze. To anyone looking for a plan for quitting I recommend you try this taper plan and taking those supplements as it helped me a lot. This kind of went on a lot longer than intended but if for those with patience I hope it may be of help to you.",2,0

I was searching for vitamins online and I came across kratom. Oddly I saw it at a gas station I thought something was up, but I purchased it a took a few caps. The feeling I got from it was amazing. I couldn't believe it was legal. 

Buying that kratom was one of my worst decisions I have ever made. It has controlled every aspect of my life for so long. I have tried to quit so many times I never thought it was going to happen. Last year I went to Florida for a week and didn't take any with me. I though that was going to work but I felt horrible the whole vacation. Couldn't wait too get back home to get more.

WDs Didn't hit me yet. I tapered myself down to 3 mgs a day before I quit. I felt pretty anxious yesterday but it was definitely tolerable. Anyone who is trying to quit. You can do it. The amount of stress that has been taken off my shoulders is the best feeling ever. My head feels clearer already. Mentally I was beating myself up every day because I would tell myself today I'm going to take it easy, and we all know how that goes.

Hey everyone, around early Nov, I made the mistake of drinking kratom 1-2 (sometimes 3) days a week. I kept it to going to the local kava/kratom bar so it'd be cost prohibitive to drink too much. Thing is, I'm fresh out of a really rough relationship, and I'm not quite sure what the cause of all this was, but trying aggressively to fix it all and get my life back. I had a horrible bout of depression 2 years ago and I never want to go back there (unrelated to kratom that time).

Anyways, I was probably drinking some 6-8g per day, a couple times a week, for most weeks in the last 2 months. I recently went through the last round of it when she and I broke up. It must've been enough that I noticed the irritability, anxiety, and low energy pop up a couple days later. I had to work on NYE, so I took an immodium to help taper and postpone things temporarily. About 2-3 days later, the fatigue returned aggressively. I pushed through, and the fatigue has mostly lifted as of today.

I do think my steroid asthma inhaler is compounding with this, as I stopped that for a few days, started again today, and the depression seems to be creeping up again. Sucks because the last year or so my asthma has been an issue.

If I went through the fatigue, night sweats, irritability, and all that, is it a possibility that the depression is caused by stopping kratom? Hoping it is and that it will pass on its own so I can get back to my happy and productive self!",3,0

Things have been going so well lately that I haven’t thought even once to post a follow up on this sub. When things suck, I’m evidently more likely to reach out for help. But now that I’m in much better shape on the kratom issue, not to mention everything else, I thought I should post here one last time to explain how I did it. If it works for at least one other person, I will feel like I’ve made something worthwhile out of a very difficult experience.

I feel great, not just because I’m free of opiates forever, but that’s obviously a big component. I could go on for a while about other components, but I’ll stick to the kratom thing. I’ve posted a couple of times over the last few years, but here’s the “as-condensed-as-possible” version. 

I’m a lifelong addict and have previously kicked alcohol and weed addictions. I tried kratom powder maybe 8 or 10 years ago during a trial of “legal highs.” It felt great but swallowing tablespoons of powder sucked, so I didn’t pursue it. Roughly 6 years ago I was in terrible back pain because of work and got an Rx for Norco, but they never seemed to last as long as they were supposed to. 🙄 And I remembered the effects of kratom and got some capsules at the smoke shop. 10 a day became 20 a day, and so on - you know that part of the story. I topped out at approximately 75 or 80 gpd, occasionally more, and stayed there for a few years. I’ve been to ETS (emergency psych ward) on a 5150 suicide hold a time or 4 (lost count) trying to quit - once I called to tell my wife goodbye and went for a walk on the train tracks until the cops dragged me off - but never made it more than a few months before relapse. I was nearing crisis again this past autumn and finally asked my wife for help, because she was ready to give up on me and leave, and that would have meant the end of my life. An addiction specialist MD who knows to take kratom seriously (hard to find even in SoCal) started me on suboxone, half a tablet 3 times a day. It wasn’t enough to get high, but it was enough to completely avoid any withdrawal symptoms whatsoever. After 2 or 3 months of that, he dropped me to 2 times a day. Within a couple weeks I decided myself to start cutting the halves into quarters, and took those twice a day. Then once a day, with increasing missed doses due to me not even thinking about taking it. I finally put it away a week ago, and now I’m done and I will never take another opiate for the rest of my life unless medically unavoidable. I want to repeat - zero withdrawal symptoms whatsoever, and once the doc started cutting me down I was able to take it from there, probably ahead of his schedule but long overdue on mine. 

That’s it. Like I said there’s a hell of a lot more going on in my life right now. To be very brief, everything is changed and I’m not nearly the same man I was just weeks ago. But this is the important part for you on this sub. I’m happy to answer questions - this is not the solution for everyone, but it might work for some.",7,0

“Hell” is being a slave to drugs and addiction. 

Withdrawal is strength, self love, courage, honesty, authenticity, fearlessness, and compassion. 

What you are feeling is your body repairing itself. It’s waking up from the slumber of suppressing your mind, body, and soul with drugs. 

You are feeling again. You are feeling everything, just as you should be. 

Good does not exist without bad. And joy and comfort does not exist without suffering. 

For a tree to grow it’s tallest, it’s roots must first reach the depths of hell. 

And from this experience, if you are patient and kind to yourself, you will grow into a fuller and stronger version of yourself. 

This is not “hell”. 

“Hell” is if you were avoiding this one more day.

scatchy websites trying to sell it and it lacks quality. My close friend is an owner of one of these websites, but his Kratom is awesome. I started buying it from him, but just personally and not through the website. The people at my school were kinda curious and wanted to try it as well. Now a year passed and I am a dealer ( it’s legal so it’s not a big deal ) but I toss and wash like 4g 3x a day and you know how the saying goes: ,,the dealer should never take his own goods”. Through out the Christmas holidays I had a few days without it and I felt like a complete shit. Now I made a deal with one of my best mates back home ( my school is like 150km from my hometown and I live at the dormitory), that I will stop taking it. I have nothing against a few grams on the night out with your friends or sometimes just use to have a good time, but it evolved into something horrible and I can’t get through a day without it. Yesterday was my first day without it and it wasn’t that bad until I went to sleep, because I couldn’t. I stayed awake until like 4:15 AM and I was so helpless, that I took 2g at about 3:00AM to help me sleep. I have to wake up at 5:45AM, so that was when shit hit the fan. I had a coffee, couldn’t eat my breakfast and eventually I had to toss and wash down another 2g at about 7:00AM. After the school I managed to get about another 2 hours of sleep, but that’s about it. I feel the worst, I can’t do anything of the things I had to do and I am just lying down and drowning in depression.
Any words of advice or at least a little bit of support ? I really need it guys, please cross your fingers for me and best of luck to any of you, who are dealing with the same issues.

Not a big dose, but felt shitty for doing it afterward. In a way, I'm not too disappointed with myself, because after taking it, I feel reminded about why I quit it to begin with! I'm not in the slightest concerned about future relapses (I mean...I guess we all are....but in terms of this triggering me into sliding into full on addiction again, its not happening)

My question is this: how will this affect my WDs, if at all? Most major s ymptoms have dissipated being as I completely stopped Kratom 3 weeks ago. Will I go back into full blown shivers/sweats/RLS? I expect some consequence, but just wanted to ask you all for those who have experience with a relapse...does it throw me right back into the thick of it?

I never thought I'd make it here... what a wild ride it's been!,"Welp, I've made it 30 days. I cold turkey'd about 25gpd after almost exactly 2 years of use. I NEVER missed a day/dose. I was a complete and utter slave to the swamp juice. I started posts at like 24 hours, 3 days, a week, etc but never finished them. Just wasn't in the right headspace I guess, but 30 days felt fitting for some reason lol I always liked reading people's experiences who had some time under their belt, and being able to write my own one day was a big motivator. 

Let me start by saying that I actually WANTED to quit for almost a year. It caused so many issues for me (high BP, hair loss, weight loss, bad skin, no sex drive, vitamin/mineral depletion, couldn't get my thyroid under control, lyme disease flares... so much more). I didn't quit for so long because I was TERRIFIED of withdrawals. I mean, fucking terrified. I go into it in some of my past posts, but in a nutshell, I quit suboxone 7 years ago and it was so bad I have PTSD-like issues surrounding that time. So just the thought of going through that again was daunting to say the least. I'm a busy mom, I have 3 young kids and a husband... I didn't know how the hell I was going to get through it. I mentally built myself up over a couple weeks and just resolved myself that no matter what this withdrawal brings, I will NOT fail. I will get through it and I WILL beat it. I told alot of my family beforehand (husband, mom, etc) and I'm glad I did. 

I tried tapering so many times and just couldn't do it. I knew I had to cold turkey. I had clonidine, vitamin C, CBD, BSO, DLPA... all the supps. Friday 12/6 was my last dose. First few days were just annoying. The mental addiction to dosing regularly was brutal. I didn't know what to do with myself. The depression was crippling. Physical symptoms weren't as bad as I thought they'd be at first. (vitamin C and clonidine were truly life savers for me). I was able to sleep maybe  2 or 3 hours a night. Getting my kids up, ready and to school everyday felt monumental. I had my 4 year old home with me most days. 

(*DISCLAIMER* HERE... please don't let the rest of this story scare you, it was only my experience. If you take anything away from this, know that you are much stronger and capable of much more than you think you are). About 5-7 days in, my symptoms actually got worse. I think I'm one of those people that have like, delayed withdrawals. I was sweating, shaking, feverish, had heart/chest pains all day/night long... it got scary. I could no longer sleep. I'd half hallucinate at night. It felt like my body was breaking down. I have lyme disease and autoimmune issues, so I think the withdrawals just sent my body into a tailspin. I had a major lyme flare during all that and I really didn't think it could get any worse. It did though. Because kratom screws with your hormones, my period started like 9 days early, which is miserable by itself (sorry guys). THEN I got the actual flu. THEN my 4 year old got the flu. When I say I was sick, I mean I was fucking SICK. I legit should have been hospitalized honestly. This all happened in a matter of a few days and lasted about 2 weeks. But ya know what? I FUCKING DID IT. I made it through all of that... withdrawals, lyme flare, flu, period, sick family, Christmas, responsibilities, etc... all at the same time. I'm not saying that because I'm special. Just that I was so scared of even regular withdrawals, and ended up going through SO much worse and still beat it. So like I said, if you take anything away from this post, let it be that you are so much stronger than you think you are and can overcome alot more than you feel capable of. I tear up now thinking about it because I just don't know how I survived all that. It was bad.. so, so bad. When things calmed down physically, I think like day 18 or 20 or something, I started 3mg of LDN. If you can get your hands on some, I highly recommend. It has helped immensely with my mood, energy, really everything. 

If you read all that, God bless you lol I'm doing pretty well now, all things considered. Not 100% but a solid 75% I'd say. If you're on the fence, just do it... jump. I don't know why I waited so long. Your experience will most likely not be as bad mine, so don't be afraid. I'm here if anybody needs to talk or has questions.

Last night was my first difficult night.

Here's how I am compensating:

1. CBD oil--2 droplets underneath my tounge--to help me feel less agitated. 
2. Went to a Sunday night church service. I haven't been to church in ages. But there is something so comforting about holding on to something bigger than yourself, especially when you feel hopeless and alone. Get some support or prayer in your life! 
3. Heating pad for my RLS. I placed the heating pad on my legs and it distracted me enough so I could stop moving and find some rest.
4. Tracking my mood: I'm using an app called ""Daylio"" and it allows you to track how you feel throughout the day--without typing a single thing. Tracking my mood has allowed me to feel ""in control"" of my body, feelings, and emotions. I would highly recommend downloading this app!

1. Hair loss - it's weird to look at this as a positive, but that's how I'm going to. Lost about half of my hair, but that helped push me to stop. It's also a good reminder of why I don't want to relapse. Awesome news is that it stopped falling out around day 75 and is now growing back, like crazy. 
2. After the acutes passed I added my quit-day flair in this sub. I've had lots of relapse thoughts, and as ridiculous as it sounds, the thought of having to give up my flair has been a deterrent. 
3. I made a list that I keep on my phone of all the cons of my addiction. It's easy to forget all the negatives, the pain of the acutes, and just glamorize how kratom made me feel at times, how it will get me through an illness or a tough work or social situation. Reading that list, and everyone's stories here, is my reality check. I feel awful reading relapse stories on this sub, but that has helped me more than you know.
4. I found out that I really need some sort of adrenaline kick to keep my mind in tune and positive.   At 3 weeks, I did a high ropes course and it was the first time I really felt like myself since quitting. Weird since I have a fear of heights. Other things that have helped with this are exercise, Wim Hof breathing and cold showers. Also psychedelics can help, if that's your thing, but only after the anxiety phase of withdrawals has passed.
5. Music! If you haven't quit yet, just wait - music is about to rock your world!",11,0

Today is Day 1 of a taper, from 50-60gpd. (Ugh). I’m serious about quitting. My mother was just diagnosed with advanced cancer, even though she’s in her 50’s. I also lost my father a couple years ago in an accident. (He was also in his 50’s). I’m realizing that time is precious, and I don’t want to waste it in a stupor.  The only good part of (possibly) losing both my parents so young is that I’m trying not to take anything for granted....

Given that there could be a strong genetic component to the cancer my mother was diagnosed with, I’ve also begun to take my health really seriously. (Exercise, paleo diet, trying to be consistent with mindfulness apps, etc). But the hugest barrier for me is KRATOM. I found a couple medical articles that suggests a strong link between cancer and opiate use of any type. It’s scaring me into abstinence. 

So here I go... Day 1 of a taper. I’ve tapered and quit before, but it was a awhile ago, and I cannot recall the withdrawls very well. During this past kratom period, I’ve dosed everyday, twice a day, for 7 months, going from 5g - 50g/day in that time. (Ouch.) 

Quick question: 

I don’t want noticeable w/d’s (I mean noticeable to other ppl, like my gf whom I sleep next to at night... who will definitely notice cold sweats and RLS). How fast can I reasonably taper? I wanna go as fast as possible. In your experience, redditors, would it be too aggressive to cut by 50% now (so take 30g for several days), then take off about .25-.5 grams a day, each day after I stabilize at the lower dose?  I’m thinking of just cutting out one whole dose during day, and then hopefully the next nightly dose will rescue me from w/d symptoms. 

Obviously this is different than the “taper guide” on this reddit suggests. But, long tapers rarely work very well for me... I’m like: “fuck it! I’ll take the whole dose then taper my *next* dose this evening.” [Then I take a whole dose in the evening, too.]  Ugh... I wish I weren’t in this mess. But I’m trying to accept it.

Here are the pros.,"It will be 3 weeks on Tuesday. Almost a month. Down to 15 gpd from over an oz a day. There has been some really shitty side effects but here’s what’s been good.

experiencing deep sleep again 

Waking up and actually being able to be functional and get my morning routine without having to dose again 

Having an appetite, room for food in my stomach, and actually putting on weight 

Being more in touch with my pain levels related to my athletic training and actually rehabbing correctly instead of slamming kratom and smoking weed 

Hair feels thicker and fuller and nails feel less brittle and flaky 

Drinking about half the amount of caffeine I was before because I’m not epically crashing off of opiates every 2-3 hours

A lot more in touch with my feelings and repressed tragedy. But man even when that’s tough I’m so ready to feel again. 

Going hours between doses and not even thinking about it 

Actually getting to spend money on nice things for myself, not nasty green powder 

Not waking up with morning sickness (I would literally get sick until I dosed in the mornings) 

And this isn’t even all of the plus sides 

It gets better guys. Don’t give up. I’ve never been strong to finish cold turkey, so I swore to myself it would work. First week was tough, but after that the jumps got pretty easy and the WD is minimal. I’m ready to be sober. I’m ready to hear my thoughts again. I’m ready to actually have sex with someone instead of not confronting my sexual trauma by tossing back this shitty drug and zoning out. I’m ready to achieve everything in my sport, life, and job I’ve been telling myself I’m not good enough to do, because secretly I knew achieving them meant letting go of kratom.

502,2020-01-05 18:03:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/ekklju/technique_thats_helped_me/,Technique That's Helped Me,"Hello all. I’ve been tapering my dosage along with supplement usage successfully, while keeping withdrawal symptoms fairly manageable. Then recently I hit a point where I couldn’t go to my next planned lower dosage without major withdrawal symptoms. I tried staying at that dosage for awhile longer and then lowering again with the same result. Then I started a regime that’s allowed me to continue tapering, and at a faster rate than usual.

Anyway, the premise is basically to move your body for a minimum of 2 minutes, every 30 minutes. Got this idea from a wellness blog article. Whether it’s stretching, walking, jumping jacks, foam rolling, visiting PornHub, a short walking meditation, etc.

[My Reminder](https://imgur.com/a/Ty0GZxt)

Usually I hit snooze and end up doing about 5-10 min every hour.

This isn’t ideal for everyone of course, and can adjust the times accordingly. But, the more frequent the better. This has helped me in a few ways:

1. Something to look forward to every 30 min since I always feel slightly better afterwards
2. Reminds me to stay active. Outside of moving a bit every 30 min or as often as I can, it reinforces how much exercise/movement helps, which motivates me to continue exercising a few days per week, thus reaping further benefits.
3. Huge help with muscle soreness, RLS, and getting a good night’s rest. Also beneficial for other symptoms but those ones especially for me. Since starting this my mood has really improved as well.

I know this is mostly common sense, but for those of you who haven’t had the physical and mental energy to do something like this, I strongly encourage you to try and stick with it for a bit. I was always so lethargic and mentally drained that I would make excuses not to get around or move much. But, my energy has increased tremendously since doing this consistently, and the other benefits have been so helpful. Hopefully this can be of help to someone.",11,0

Did this for about 8 months, but have had more time using it before this, I had quit and foolishly started back again for 8 months. 

The first night for me was particularly awful. I basically laid there all night trying to sleep but couldn't. Maybe got like an hour total. Kept waking up in a pool of sweat with cold/hot flashes. Had a bit of RLS where I kept wanting to move around in bed but it wasn't that bad. This got better over the course of the first few weeks. Much improved when I started smoking weed again. 

Around day 7 I had been also quitting weed and had quit that about 5 weeks before this, but decided I'd allow myself to smoke again to get through the first hump of kratom. It's probably time for me to work on quitting weed now that I'm at a month. When I decided this, the whole thing became easier because I was just getting high and forgetting about it. 

I was in a somewhat decent mood the first few days and then I became very agitated and easily angered. This slowly drifted away even to now at a month, and maybe still has some room to go but mostly normal now. Obviously smoking weed took the edge away from this. 

I was never taking kratom as a painkiller, but my back pain definitely increased after I quit, mostly from work. It's getting better. 

The biggest change is my mood. Where when first taking kratom, I would be in a good mood no matter what, after some time that transformed into this wierd paranoid looking for anything to piss me off state that would come and go and I was just very bi polar. This is pretty much gone now I'm way more even keeled.  I also look healthier I think.

I use to abuse prescription pain killers in a very unhealthy relationship. Since then I haven’t touched a pill, but I always knew about Kratom. 

18 months ago, I went to a smoke shop and the guy there was pushing it on me. So, I bought some.. went home and wow.... it was like a dream. 

Obviously, I started taking more and more. Im up to 15-25g per day. I weigh out my doses but find myself mixing some Kratom 2 hours later... it’s bad.

18 months later, my life revolves around this and I hate it.

Yesterday morning I took some at 9am and then I had a panic attack. I’m not sure if it was the Kratom, or maybe the pot... but it was my wake up call.

It’s 9am almost again, the next day... I feel horrible. Night sweats/chills (probably the worst part for me, I was drenched this morning) RLS, and arms, my stomach hurts, eyes watering, yawning.... yada yada yada... pretty much everything.

I only weigh about 120 lbs so maybe that’s why I’m withdrawing so fast but I’ve never withdrawn off Kratom so I’m unsure.

I read the Quitting CT guide and I just dumped my stash. I’m done.

I actually stopped following this thread several months ago just because this has become such a thing of my past. But today I was thinking about the period of my life that I was deep in kratom addiction and feeling hopeless. After reflecting on how grateful I am to be where I am I realized I should maybe reach out to you guys and just let you know there are some of us that are able to really kick this and that life becomes so much better!!!!

Today marks 391 days clean from kratom. I know when I was addicted I felt so much disparity and lack of hope that I could really kick this. The amount of relapses just kept crushing me.... but here I am. On the other side of it feeling healthy, clear headed and happy. I don’t want this to come off just as me praising myself, although I am very proud. I just know I appreciated seeing stories of people being successful at quitting. 

Feel free to reach out to me if you want more details or want insight to what helped me quit. Keep the fight guys! You are all amazing people and deserve to be happy.",36,0

So it's almost my 4th day of ct and it's absolutely amazing to finally be able to say that I'm sober! (even though I still feel like crap)

 I don't want drugs I just want myself. I did a lot of acid the past year and I always came to the conclusion that everything I need is myself and that no drug can give me such beautiful feelings then sobriety it self. I hated me all along so I hided behind drugs (mainly kratom and amphetamines) but I gotta say I'm not that bad after all and there's no need to hate myself or hide from myself.

 Life itself is the most beautiful euphoric trip you can imagine and i'm happy to be back at it for now on :) I wish you all so much luck withdrawal is an absolute fucking bitch, but once it's over you'll be so proud of yourself and thankful that you finally got back to yourself again!

I just found this group, and I am so thankful that I did. I have been taking Kratom for just under a year now. I'm up to about 20grams a day (on a bad day). And in my heart of hearts, I know it's too much. I feel like it's starting to rule my life. 

Initially, when I found Kratom, I was ecstatic. It's the one thing that allowed me to stop taking hydrocodone for my back pain (I fractured my T12 vertebra almost 3 years ago). So in the beginning, I was taking it as a way to get off prescription drugs. It worked. But psychologically, I now feel like I am back to Square 1. Sure, it helps with the pain. But if I'm being truthful with you guys, I don't take it for pain, I take it to escape. 

I'm an entrepreneur. I work 80+ hour weeks on my business, and I've managed to become extremely successful this year. I've made enormous sacrifices in my personal life to achieve this. I'm 25, female, single, and I live alone--and I feel extremely lonely. All I do is work. Kratom takes the edge off for me. It helps me overcome the boredom of doing the same thing over and over and over again (work on my business). 

I know I need to stop taking it. It's messing with my mind, and my heart, for that matter. I want to pursue a life of peace, freedom, and wisdom. And this is the thing that is getting in my way. I suppose what I am looking for is your motivation. I need the encouragement to quit for good. Please help!",11,0

It is a nasty drug and has totally screwed up my life. Due to my age (I'm 62) and high blood pressure, I've decided to detox under medical supervision. I also have a full time job, so going CT by myself was not for me. So I'm checking into a facility on Monday. Please don't leave me negative comments - I'm scared enough as it is. In order to feel ""normal"" I need about 40-50 capsules a day. Tapering wasn't working for me; I just ended up taking more. So here I am - got to take sick leave from work and I just want this crap out of my system. I know it's not going to be easy, but I didn't know where else to turn. I finally told my husband about my addiction over the holidays and he's being as supportive as I can expect. After all, I'm screwing up his life too. So here I go. Please wish me luck. I feel like I'm taking the cowards way out but the fear of withdrawals was daunting and I'm truly concerned about my general health. I'm told they will also take me off klonopin which has been a long time coming anyway. Needless to say, I'm terrified but feel I'm doing the right thing. I feel so scared, so alone and just can't believe I've gotten into this position. I didn't even know this stuff was addicting - what a fool I've been.

**Physicaly**:all ok not any physicaly symptoms.. but I am not hungry! I dont want to eat, I have to force myself, but I think it is not enough. Maybe it is because **Kanna usage** (I stoped use it today). And bought some milk products such as, acidophilic milk and yoghurts.

**Psychicaly:** I think PAWS hit me on day 36.. no motivation, because of anxiety (I feel clutching on my chest), I think anxiety is very because of **tinnitus**, which is sometime louded and sometime not. I took to some videos about Neuroplasticity. It can be key to escape anxiety, but it needs practice.  Some source here:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTuX\_ShUrw0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTuX_ShUrw0)Do you have tinnitus guys? Here is not so much posts about it.  I think I have a bright day only when I don't hear tinnitus.

**What is working for me?** Only thing which is help me is **beer at afternoon or evening**. One or two beers are enough to have better mood. Not more, because it will produce wakeups at night. Alcohol in this dosage is very helpfull for me. I tryed more, but it will do things worste next day. I believe that beer is not affecting my brain recovery from fu\*king Kratom. Go to sleep at 10pm and trying to do as daily habit. Sometime 1 wakeup, sometime 2-3 wakeups. But total sleep is every day more than 7h.

**Supplements which I use**Lot of water, L-tryptophan, Complex B vitamins (all of kinds),Omega 3, C vit, Ashwagandha, L-tyrosine, L-theanin, tea from Brahmi.

**Activity**Excercising HIIT training - 15-20 min intensive (for example:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieyzL5OaPZk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieyzL5OaPZk))But this it can't be done each day, because I need regeneration. In no excercise day I will get hot bath or swimming on poll. So trying 2 days HIIT and 1 day swimming or relax.

**Conclusion**Now on day 43.. I try to enjoy things, but it is not possible. No motivation to work or fun things like Netflix or PC games.  I believe it will be back soon. **I decided to not use green devil to end of my live**. I am not struggling, only one thing I want is back myself. And after this fu\*king hell was out.. I wrote large topic about this green danger for education of those who want to try it for fun. Kratom takes for now all what I loved and I want to have it back!

I still miss the feeling of the full sun often. But not constantly, like the first weeks.

My world is still heavy at times with the precipitation of quitting. But it isn’t sopping and cold to the touch—I mean, I no longer blanch at the thought of every element of my life.

I still wander, I’m still drifting, waiting to solidly land and know my quit has run itself out. That I’ve been freed, no tangling alkaloid strings confusing my feelings, thoughts, emotions and desires.

This isn’t sad. It’s hope for the long-haul quitter. You may feel better at 7-10 days, but you are not! I mean, you’re better, but you’re not.

It seems getting over the opiates is quick and easy, comparatively. But getting over the (as many as) 40 other alkaloids takes a serious long-term effort. The worst part? Not having any idea which alkaloid is doing what to your sanity/bio-rhythm/hormones/etc. or how long any of it is going to last, or—worst of all—not knowing when the next punch is going to hit, cuz there is very little ‘linear degradation’ in the power *and* strength of kratom’s withdrawals.

Oddly, I’m in full agreement with the people who said quitting kratom was a lot easier than quitting the harder stuff, but I also agree with the people who said it’s much harder. Bottom line, it *is* much easier, but prepare yourself because it is way harder and much more baffling than any opioid/opiate I’ve quit. (Never did anything heavier than percs and Fentynal)

I guess it’s the alkaloids.

The last bit of tough news: If you did a long slow taper, depending on how you did it (many variables) it can seem like PAWS began the moment of your last dose. Actually, for me, I think I was in PAWS the entire last month of my taper. But that was my fault.

Take heart, though. It really does get better (*starts to*) around the end of day 4 or day 5. And at 2 weeks you are way ahead of where you were at one week … just don’t think it’s over.

And at 40 days? Well, if you’ve been doing this poisonous swamp scum for a while (say a year or more) then you have forgotten what joy is, and friendship, and conversation, real consciousness, clear thought patterns, logic, balanced thinking, a good laugh, an enlivened smile. And peace.

Yup, it gets waaayyy, better, but supps aren’t gonna matter a hoot.

This has been my experience. Not everyone’s

I started taking kratom about 11 months ago after having a psychotic break from too much anxiety (manic psychosis, pretty much communicating with the cosmos).  Kratom helped a ton when I was breaking under the anxiety, then a long period of diminishing returns.  Now, after months of daily use (0.5-2 teaspoons every couple hours every day),  I'm trying to taper and I can't tell if the anxiety is withdrawal or just my natural state when off of kratom.  It's a bit unnerving not knowing whether I'm tapering too fast or just crazy underneath the haze and feeling of ease that kratom puts me in.  Reading the other posts it seems like I've been taking a much lower daily dose than many other people, who originally used it for pain or opioid addiction.  I was going through maybe 2-3oz a week, not anywhere near the grams I've been reading per day, but my anxiety while on vacation recently for 10 days with almost no kratom was very intense.  I didn't even think it was kratom withdrawal until my friend said the anxiety symptoms sounded like withdrawal from something.  ""oh shit"" I thought, I was drinking kratom all day for months and now I'm not taking any at all!  So after that week of waking up at 3am with sweat all over, having night terrors and anxiety throughout the day, I am now on a taper of 1/2 teaspoon every 6 hours until I run out of kratom.  There isn't much left so I'll probably be out by this coming Monday. Too quick? Experiences?  Rambling I know...Thoughts?",5,0

Day 9 CT,"So I’m not gonna go in depth with my story but the quick version, started around when my son was born 6 years ago. I was one of those who thought it was safe and non-addictive. Spiraled out of control, my ex left, lost my job, drank a lot etc etc. got clean for about 2-3 months. But didn’t take the quit serious, started using again but I felt like I was in a better place, probably just because work, school, relationships were all going well, behind the scenes I was an addict in denial. Then I started reading all the negative stuff and heard about the horror stories and that was a wake up. I decided I’m done. I found this group which has been the most beneficial thing for me in the journey. I tapered to 10gpd and jumped. I was clean for about 6-8 months, I felt happy, confident, life was wonderful. But I also think this may have been a pink cloud phase kinda thing. Cause I told myself I can use it again and this time I’ll be in control etc etc, you know the stuff addicts tell themselves to justify. And I spiraled again, hurt loved ones, I was numb to everything again. CT for 3 days couldn’t handle it cause it was around Christmas and I didn’t want to deal on Christmas. But Christmas was my last dose. Super rough 5-6 days. Just the mental stuff is hard for me. 

Anyways it’s day 9 CT
Feeling more like a human again, emotions, smiles, human interaction is enjoyable and all that. I’m done done this time. Never going back and now that I’m aware of the pink cloud and how long this journey really takes I’m dedicated to a better happy life than the one kratom provides.

While on kratom I was able to manage my food intake better. It gave me a sense of control over my food intake, because I would always take my kratom before eating then eat 20-30 minutes later.
I felt that because I was on kratom I had to be more conscious about what I eat and make myself eat not only just food, but food with nutrition . 
I tried quitting kratom the day after Christmas and went to a family event where everyone cooked a meal and completely lost control over the amount of food that I ate to the point where I was eating knowing well I was going to throw up shortly after. 
Cut to today, where I have 3 days sober and I have no appetite... I'm getting through the days with a cocktail of supplements, but I'm terrified that I'll loose control over my eating habits... and my addict brain is telling me that with kratom it will be easier living with my eating disorder, but I know that's not true...
I'm hoping that I'm not alone in this struggle... would love to hear about anyone's story that might be similar.",7,0

Im a food vendor that delivers and merchanises product all day long...sometimes 14hrs a day nonstop with no brakes. My body has taken abuse over the years. When i mean abuse....i mean abuse in everyway. I do everything to the max! Work hard, play hard, and of course, abuse drugs. Im an addict at everything i do (good or bad). Its a gift and a curse, all at once. Kind of like how kratom has played a role in my life. I was a brutal alcoholic for about 10 years, drinking hard liquor every night....sometimes up to a liter of whiskey a night. Then get up at 3-4am and go to work!?! Insanity when i think about it now?!?! But 3 years ago i met my current girlfriend and i absolutly love her to death! She doesnt smoke, drink, or do anything and just loves life. She was my inspiration for becoming clean... so heres where kratom comes into the picture :/ Im at one of my corner store accounts at work and was presented with kratom. The guy told me he couldnt believe this stuff is actually legal because its like percocet. Me being curious, bought a pack and took a few caps. Man! What a great day at work that was?!?! So i decided that i was going to try and quit smoking cigarettes and alcohol COLD TURKEY that night! Crazy? Yes! Did i do it???? YES!!! I also felt like i was going to have a mental break down too...there was one night i remember vividly crying on my girlfriends lap saying ""never again""! Over and over... but i got through it using the kratom for anxiety and the paws of all that. After a month clean, i was still using the kratom at work ALL THE TIME?! My girlfriend had no idea i was taking it or what it was. Over the coarse of 3 years my kratom dose jumped from just a few grams to around 100g or more per day! I was absolutly ashamed of myself, becoming more depressed, more eager to stop and i couldnt. A few times, the store i was buying from ran out, and i started to get sick?! I got really scared because i didnt know what was happening? I drove an hour out of town to find more. I have a very fast paced job that i couldnt afford to let my customers down...so the cycle got more and more intense. This went on for 3 years...spending thousands! Lying! And for what? So i wouldnt get sick anymore? My first time trying to quit i  had some vacation time coming up, and figured a week should be enough...NOPE! My symptoms started coming too late because i had kratom left over and decided to take it until it was gone...3 days into my vacation. This is insanity. I never thought in my life that i would be able to quit smoking cigarettes and heavy alcohol CT but cant kick this green shit?!? So the using continued.... i started getting extremely depressed, the kratom wasnt even having an effect anymore. It was robbing me to feel pleasure. Also i was extremely constipated...i was having to take laxitives just to go to the bathroom! My sex life was tanking and i could see my girlfriend starting to be effected. Enough was enough! I said to myself scew this crap! I need to start tapering down because CT isnt going to work! I started going to the gym and dieting. Lost some weight and going hard in the gym! But then it happened, i was putting so much strain on my body between kratom work, kratom gym. I gave myself a nasty hernia!?! I couldnt even go back to work. I was put on disability...the doctor told me i needed surgery and asked if i was taking anything...i lied and said no. I was terrified leading up to the surgery. I tried to put the kratom down 2 days before but i didnt think that was enough time? I started getting sick the day of the surgery. All i kept thinking was that the anesthesia wasnt going to work right. Literally was scaring me to death. But the surgery went good and nothing happened. The only other problem was, now im home with pain killers...of course that wasnt enough....right?!?! I dragged my ass POST OP to the smoke shop for kratom!?!? Wtf is wrong with me... So heres my current situation. Ive been home healing for 2 months and was taking the painkillers and kratom in excess till the painkillers ran out. Ive gained almost 20lbs. I told myself this would be the perfect time for me to detox because i didnt have to worry about work. I wasted half my time on disability but Im throwing in the towel! Im doing this. I dont care if i end up in the mental hospital. Im going to quit. So i jumped a few days ago and wouldnt you believe my girlfriend got me suprise tickets to an event in new york city for the day..... ( this would be day 3 of my detox ) i was so happy she got this for more me, but she had no idea my plans to quit. I still went through with my plan. So came the day in the city, and im in agony! Couldnt sleep, muscles aching, sweating horribly!!! We had a 2 hour train ride and she wanted to walk for miles! Lol, what in the hell did get myself into? The whole day was a fight, just marching through the crowds, feeling like i have the flu, sweating uncontrollably. Looking over at my girlfriend....saying yea, im fine lol. I figured ive endured enough pain from the day to make sure i never have to go through this again. So here i am... day 6, things are getting a little better. I actually slep half way decent last night. I did take melatonin for help. I hope this message touches someone out there like me. I know i feel alot better just typing this out.",31,0

The last ~70 days have been far better than the previous two years.

Music sounds breathtaking again. The smell of rain is a natural high. The future feels bright and I feel strong. I am driven and motivated to live a life that carries far more joy than kratom offered. 

I no longer wake up in the morning feeling dread and anxiety about the day and life in general.

I feel *good* again.

Kratom changes you in ways that you don't even realize until you're off and look back. The changes that you notice about yourself while you're hooked (anxious, depressed, withdrawing from being social) are just the tip of the iceberg.

My advice to those quitting: try to be COMPLETELY sober. I know this goes against the grain, but I see the addict mentality around here quite a bit with people trying to use another substance to mitigate the pain of the withdrawal and PAWS period. **To truly recover, we need to retrain our brains to feel joy from real-life sober experiences again** . This means even abstaining from weed IMO. It may be a little rougher at first, but understand that the PAWS depression is your brain resetting itself in a way. The darker the despair, the bigger improvement you stand to make.

My second big tip is that you have to *literally practice* enjoying normal sober things again. At first during the withdrawl period, taking a walk or seeing a movie will not bring much joy at all. You have to fake it until you make it. This is like exercise for your brain. Before too long, you will start to feel joy again doing these things. Day 28ish was the part where the tides turned for me.

I wish the best for all of you here. I don't know any of you personally, but feel like we're family in a way for knowing the same pain so well.",14,0

Why dosent eating right going to the gym meditating and trying to spend time with friends and loved ones while trying to enjoy my last day of break help?

Finally made the jump off k on 12/23/19. Did a long taper of 3.5 months from 30 gpd to 5. Was on Kratom for 3.5-4ish years. Used it to get off methadone. Was on methadone and opiates for about 4-5 ish years before that. At that point I was taking upwards of 100+gpd. As the methadone withdrawal subsided so did my k use. But then stuck at around 30 gpd since then. So anyways, I barely had any acutes this time round and pretty much went straight into paws. Anyone want to chime in on there experiences with Kratom paws and it’s duration? This is the second time I successfully tapered off Kratom, only made it 2 weeks last time tho as I was sick of having no energy. Determined this time round to be the last time. Would love to hear all your experiences with the PAWS and it’s duration for you.

I am trying to start the process of quitting kratom but I have not taken any real steps as of yet. Actually, I am about to redose after I go to the grocery store. I have been ingesting kratom leaf powder for the last 2+ years, usually in an iced tea lemonade concoction. I don't currently measure so I have no idea how many grams I take each day. Multiple times a day. 

It's hard to let go because I have become so attached to the ""high"" buzzy foggy feeling. My tolerance has long prevented me from feeling anything close to the nice warm energy of the early days. Even when I take a massive dose (which happens most nights as I compulsively refill my tea bottle) I only end up with nausea or i fall asleep until I wake up, sick again. 

I quit hard drugs unofficially and officially several times in my life. The last time was about 3 years ago (meth). Then I realized I had a problem with alcohol. I have not had a drink (alcohol) in over a year. All this, esp quitting alcohol, has had a major positive effect on my life and wellbeing. I'm back in school, relatively stable, and doing well as a functional adult. But daily kratom use remains a big obstacle. I can't leave the house for more than a few hours without a backup dose. So I stay pretty isolated outside of attending classes f/t. I don't have any close friends and my kratom problem prevents me from making any or even wanting to meet people. My world has become so much better since 2017, but still is so small. I know I can't finish school and become successful in my profession without giving this up. 

I guess this post is my attempt to look at my life with some objectivity. I can feel my strong (irrational) resistance to quitting as I write this. But I also see compelling reasons to push through the discomfort and finally stop with the bullshit. I am afraid of withdrawals, which i know are godawful. I only have experienced the first stage of acute wds each morning when I wake up before my first dose.. runny eyes/nose, sweats, cold feeling, skin crawling, etc. I don't know how I can possibly tolerate any of the stronger symptoms for any longer than a day. Tapering is probably what I need to do, at least at first. If I can stick to it.

Just took my last dose, and Naltrexone questions","Hi All! Just took my last dose! I've lurked in this community for a long time. 2 1/2 year user, up to 40-ish gpd but a little more the last couple of weeks. I've attempted to quit so many times I've lost count, I think this is 6 or 7? I won't go into my whole story but started taking to help with anxiety, and like most here, it got gradually out of control.

In my past quits (always CT) I've always relapsed at most about 2 weeks in. I can get through the physical wd like days 1-5, but it's always the anhedonia and cravings that do me in after that point. So this time, I have really mentally and also prepared better in other ways - I renewed my gym membership, spent all day prepping food so I don't have to worry about cooking (otherwise I eat like crap and order pizza and junk). Downloaded a new game and even wrote a letter to myself that I can read when I'm having a hard time.

Most importantly, I have a bunch of rx's, and most importantly some Naltrexone (10mg doses 2x day). My doctor has been telling me I shouldn't start taking it until a week after my last dose, and I have an appt in a couple of weeks to go in and get the actual shot. I have researched and understand how it works and the risk of precipitated withdrawals if I take it sooner, but I'm concerned that the cravings will get to me before then, and am thinking about taking it sooner. I figure I'm going to be miserable anyways right? I'm wondering what experiences y'all have had with it, and how soon you took some. Would I be okay taking it on day 2 or 3?  Does it make withdrawals worse, or would it actually speed up the process?

Thanks everyone! This community is amazing.

Edit: Thanks for the replies everyone. After seeing comments and starting down a rabbit hole reading posts from others on reddit who have wondered or tried to take the naltrexone sooner than they should, it looks like it's not worth the risk. It seems some people were able to do it and had hell on earth for a few hours, but come out ok, but others actually had to go to the ER. The precipitated withdrawals sound like they are not worth speeding up the process. It's also frustrating that I had to find this all out on my own rather than my from my doctor. She of course told me the timeline but not WHY. They should be more open about the reason for waiting and what happens if you don't wait an appropriate amount of time.",5,0

If you had asked me on day 3 I would have said this sucks and I should have just kept using kratom. I started my taper on 12/27. The first 3 days tapering were horrible. I am slowly starting to feel better. Im still having some mood swings and RLS likes to creep in at night or wake me up still. I am finally starting to feel a difference. I am seeing my interest in stuff coming back slowly! I don’t want to sleep all day! 
Everyday is getting a little better, so if you are just starting you can do this! I quit CT about a year and a half ago and then started back in June. My advise after doing a CT is go the taper route. Do it slowly -.5 each day. You built up to the level you are on...so you are gradually going to have to work yourself back down slowly. 
I don’t have much willpower...I have an addictive personality so it’s hard not to want to take more, but once I figured up how much money I was throwing away and saw that crazy amount of $$$ I realized it’s not worth it and I could have paid months and months worth on a trip or car instead of Kratom.",6,0

Hi everyone, some of you may remember me (and my little boy Beanie).  I'm 5 or so months off this seaweed.  So, so grateful.  For anyone not familiar with my story, readers digest version:  Close to 30 years sober from alcohol.  Found Kratom early last year and spent 8 months in a total fog.  I was severly abusing it as my addictive personality just roared back to life.  I can't give measurements because I never measured but I was taking a TON every single day and on a couple of occassions I couldn't even walk.  I still remember looking in the mirror agast at what/who was looking back.  Sunken eyes, grey ash complexion, hair painted on my scalp, and the sadness...it was just the saddest person looking back at me, and I recall thinking ""omg, where did I go?  I want me back!"".  I was horrified and even worse, I couldn't quit.  A taper would last mere hours, a CT even less.  I had so many flashbacks of my drinking days when I couldn't quit. I just could not believe I did this to myself.  AGAIN.  One day my little dog Bean was diagnosed with congestive heart failure.  I think it was the very next day I ran out of Kratom and right there said ""I'm done, Beanie needs me.""  There was no planning at all, it was a Thursday.  I have never used again.**

**I quit on Thursday, went to work on Friday.  I still remember when people would talk to me I thought my head was going to crack open, but I muddled through.  Sat. and Sun I sat on the couch and stared at the wall.  I didn't move.  I cried a lot.  A REAL lot.  Monday - Wednesday I was still fragile, moving gently, and by Thursday things were getting better.  I took two Advil PM's at night, sleep was not easy that first week, not even with the Advil, but something had changed this time around.  I didn't care how much I suffered, I really didn't.  I didn't get all in my head and scare myself and tell myself I couldn't do it.  I just totally surrendered to whatever was going to come and funny enough what came was no where near the nightmare I had played out in my head during the previous quits.  It was not a picnic, I would not want to repeat it, but for me it was no worse than a bad flu.**

**When I had RL I would massage my legs so hard it hurt, but it helped.  I sipped water w/apple cider vinegar.  I couldn't even take a vitamin.  I felt I had abused myself so severely by that point that I couldn't bring myself to take anything, even if it was supposedly good for me.**

**Life definitely started getting better.  I was coming back to life.  My complexion was getting healthy, my hair was getting shiney and fluffy again.  I wasn't filled with shame, I could make eye contact again.  I was getting excited about life, noticing the small things like flowers in a field, birds singing in the morning and of course the most important thing of all was the time I had with Bean. I treated him like a King - hydrotherapy every day, lots of time outside in the sunshine, lots of great memories.  There's a part of me that sometimes wonders if he got sick on purpose to save me.  We had a bond that is indescriable.**

**On October 7th my little boy passed away in my arms.  I held him for forever it seemed.  I didn't want to let him go, but it was perfect.  He was at home, with me, safe and loved.  I couldn't have asked for better if he had to leave.  And of course, he did.  I will never dishonor his beautiful life by using Kratom again.  That's how I feel, that if I were to pick up again, I would be dishonoring him.  But no worries there, I have no desire.  None what-so-ever.**

**When I kicked alcohol, at that time someone said to me ""you don't have to live like this, you can change your whole world"" and I thought ""I can?"".  That had never even occurred to me back then, that I could change my whole world and live a different, better life.  Be a different, better version of myself.  And that's exactly what happened - I went on to be successful at a job I loved, I bought nice house, raised my child in a happy home.  All the things I never thought I could do or have.  I had a ton of messes to clean up, which I did.  And I studied, boy did I study - I was obsessed with self-improvement.  Looking back I can see the tremendous progress I made, inwardly as well as out.  I overcame so much and I thrived.  I forgave myself and everyone else, life was great.**

**I realize now when my child left for college I let things slide.  I stopped taking care of me, stopped being so plugged into life, I somewhat lost my purpose if you will.  So this time around I knew I needed to start over but as a single person in this world.  So I'm back to those books and video's, back to many of the hobbies I loved, and feeling happier than I have in several years.  I share all this because it's important to give yourself things to look forward to, to work towards, think outside the old familiar box.  If your only thinking of your next fix or not being able to have your next fix, how is that motivating?**

**I'm making plans again.  I hope to travel this year.  I already have 1/2 my Christmas shopping for 2020 done, new hair style, etc.  My biggest news is my new baby Vida who came into my life.  She's a similar breed to Bean, and will probably end up the same size/weight.  She's currently 6 pounds.  But she thinks she's 600.  Totally fearless, I could learn a lot from her.  Live your life fearlessly.  Make the jump, stop making excuses, deal with being uncomfortable for a few days.  Already I look back and it truly seems like a lifetime ago when I ran out of Kratom and during my lunch our drove 40 minutes one way to buy more because I couldn't make it until 5.  Oh, and the money.  THE MONEY.  I spent so much on Kratom, it's embarrassing.  Suddenly I could pay for Beanies vet and medicine, Christmas was wonderful, I could afford Vida.  I am healing from the inside out and it just keeps getting better.  Please...you can do this.  You really can.  I thought I was an utter failure, but only not trying at all would have been failing.  The first couple of fails led to success, so don't give up.  I truly wish you all the very best in this new year!**",26,0

I believe I had the shortest pink cloud phase ever like 5 or 6 days. Every day is different now and don't have the same drive and light attitude that I was able to maintain during acute wd. It seems strange that my attitude is crap compared to when dealing with acute wd. Just weird I guess. Never know who I will be each morning when I wake up if I even slept. Has anyone else experienced this? Is this paws? Today is good yesterday very bad. Was full of anxiety and depression as well as lack of energy and enthusiasm. Today totally different.

I made a post about quitting kratom. Switching to plain leaf didn’t work, and i think it’s because the opms shots around here (the brand has changed formula every few months) have such a high amount of 7-ho-mitragynine (or is it another molecule) that makes it super strong for two hours then i have needed to dose every 3 hours, exoeriening withdrawal every 2.5 hours. Felt like the fentanyl of kratom. 

I took a shot last night at 7pm. It’s not 8am and no kratom. I took .25mg last night and melatonin and 75mg lyrica (got a 90 script-inb4 I don’t plan on taking it past day 3) and hash rosin. 

So far, I woke up in mild withdrawal and took about .6mg of suboxone and feel somewhat normal. Vape some hash and feeling better. 

If I continue this, and decreasing my subs over today and tomorrow and possibly the day after should I be in the clear? Is the lyrica a good idea for the first couple days at low dose?(I have 25mg capsules) and I’ve also been prescribed subs in the past so I don’t think at this dose it was a leap: in fact I feel it was a perfect dose of sub considering each shot was about 4mg of 7-ho-mitraginine(sp?)  so it’s not that far of a stretch cause the withdrawals were quick and rapid. I don’t think it was cut it anything but that. 7-ho only .2% of the whole kratom plant, so you would not get close to 4mg from even 11gs (I tried)

Keep y’all posted. I fucking hate subs but it’s helping.",2,0

Finally got to the 30 day mark and feeling great. I think i'm back to my old self now. I totally exhausted but not because of WD but because of driving 4000km (2485 miles) from Germany to Georgia. No i can rest for 14 days, lets see how i will feel afterwards. I even can drink caffeine again and sleep at night. I wake up several times at night, but i can sleep like 8 even 9 to 10 hours now. I think it was at the day 21 mark when i could sleep 8 hours again. It is so good to go to bed and just chill relaxed in the bed WITHOUT having to drink the green sludge. I feel so much better now i so many ways its crazy that i spend so much money to numb LIFE! What a mess. What a waste of financial ressources its crazy. But i do not look back now. I look forward. From now on i am a digital nomad. I life where i want to. I will earn my money over the internet without paying taxes. The last days i didnt think about kratom anymore. Today i realized that its exactly 30 days that i started my withdrawal and its over. I dont have PAWS thankfully, because of my biotuner, which i only used 21 days.... I will start using if i need to but i dont need it right now because if feel GREAT!

For all KQ that are still in the process: Just push through the first 21 days like a soldier. Then you will sleep again. The anxiety will linger one more week then it will subside. If it does not, go exercise, do the WIM Hof breathing method which i do now everday because it makes me feel sooo good because of the endorphins and cold showers for 300% dopamine. You dont need ANY substances, herbs or anything. You can control your biochemie 100% with these methods. And the best thing: You dont have to pay anything because your brain PRODUCES them on its own. Its not addictive either. Also i would advise you to get the SOTA Bio-Tuner BT9 because it DOES help SO MUCH to shorten the recovery period and prevent PAWS altogether!

Guys and girls this is my last post. I will not count the days anymore. I will not think about kratom anymore. Its not worth my time to even do that. If you still count the days your NOT done with it. Its when you forgot about kratom and you stop counting the days when you really destroyed your addiction / dependence! Do other things. Things that you used to love as soon as you feel motivated. Maybe you have to push yourself first. But when you just start it will be more thatn worth it. Kratom filled a hole. Now you have to fill that hole with ENJOYING LIFE, HOBBIES, FRIENDS, LOVED ONES, EXERCISE, MUSIC, CREATIVE ACTIVITIES, WORK ON YOUR PERSONALITY.... Transform your life into a masterpiece! Now check out how far you can go and whats possible for you in this universe! God bless you all!

I still have a little bit of vertigo from time to time, and mild anxiety here and there, just like y’all said it would be, some days are better than others, but all in all i’m pretty much back to business as usual. Sometimes i do wonder if these things are now a permanent part of my brain chemistry, but you people haven’t been wrong so far, so i trust you when you say it’s all temporary.  I’ve noticed i no longer require 7 cups of coffee to get me through the day, my body has plenty of energy when i’m not constantly drinking downer sludge.  My body temp seems to be regulating itself better too. I used to sit in the air conditioned kava bar shivering, absolutely freezing, not it just feels like a normal comfortable temp.  I’ve told the people at the kava bar what i went through and why i dont drink kratom anymore, and they of course didn’t believe me, much like I wouldn’t have believed it 6 months ago.  I had a conversation with somebody there tho who knew exactly what i was talking about, they said they got down to 1g a day just for maintenance and then started again and that they wish they could come of the stuff, it kind of reassured me that quitting was the right decision.  I know they use reddit so if you happen to browse this sub, just know there’s no time like the present T, and there’s lots of help here. Life feels way better on the other side.  Other than that i don’t have much to add. Life is just regular life now. I don’t really post here much anymore, hut when i was in early stages of my quit i would try so hard to find success posts from people with a few months under their belt. There was never a lot of those kinds of posts but they always made me feel much better about what i was going through so i’ll still be checking in from time to time with the hopes that i can provide that comfort to somebody else who may be going through it. No matter how much or how long you’ve used, i promise you it gets exponentially better as time goes on.  There’s a reason they say that time heals all wounds.

I instantly recognized the feeling.  You feel as if you are having this surge of energy.  What can be best described as ""heat"" or tension is forming at the back base of your skull, the anxiety is creeping in.

Your thoughts begin to race and you begin to think of millions of ways things could go wrong.  It may as simple as worrying about getting a good night's sleep to losing your job or a loved one.  You begin to stress and worry about things that are beyond your control, none of them have even happened or have signs of happening.  Its perpetual worry.

The anxiety is amplified by marijuana.  One toke can send you swirling to an anxious abyss.  However, after 10 or 15 minutes, you feel better... relaxed almost but still very tense.  In a weird way, it sort of helps balance you out.

This is where I currently at in my recovery.  After years of off and on use in the 30-60gpd range and all the withdrawals that come with it, I'm here again.  Even though the anxiety makes you want to shoot through the roof, it's an improvement.  I went from feeling nothing and constantly feeling tired to where I'm now starting to get some energy back.  I'm not sleeping all the time and the level, at which I'm tired, when I get home is edging back to normal.  Its actually nice... if you take out the anxiety.

I noticed how much I hated being at home, which I usually love.  I wanted to actively break up the monotony of my existence.  For the past 20 days I've wanted nothing more than to do nothing, now I have a small urge to do things.

I also found myself giggling today which is nice.  I hadn't even smoked which has been the only thing to get me feeling something.

My appetite is roaring back to life.  I'm hungry a lot more.  However when I do eat, it doesnt take much.  I get full very easily and sometimes almost sick to my stomach.  I've also noticed I want actual real food more.  I dont want candy or chips or crap, I am hungry for real whole foods.

My digestion is hit or miss.  Every day is different.

I am thirsty a lot but a small sip of water does the trick.  It's much like food.  However, I get thirsty pretty easily.

The days of being lazy have taken their toll.  I need to get a haircut and my kitchen needs a basic cleaning.  Nothing that wouldn't be fixed in 30 mins or less.  I plan on handling everything this weekend.

I'd say this is positive.  I've been at the anxiety stage several times before.  Depending on my dosage, length of use, etc... it has happened at different times.  This one has to be one of the later times it's happened.  I've dealt with it as early as day 2 or 3, but typically it's in week 2, not 3.  This tells me this has been a pretty serious withdrawal.  Good news is that by day 30 I will be so much better.  Day 40+ and I will probably have forgotten about everything.

The anxiety phase usually will last for me between 2 and 5 days as it peaks.  Tomorrow will probably be intense and Friday will ease up and by Sunday I will be much better.  My chemical balance is starting to normalize.  It's insane how much your brains chemistry shapes your worldview.

This weekend I would like to do the following: clean the apartment, meal prep for the week and get in a simple workout.  Something simple enough to get me back in the gym.

3-4 months from now I would like to be fit again.  I also want to get back in the dating world and get over my anxieties over my personal insecurities.  I moved to a new city just a few months ago and know zero people, so I'd like to make some friends as well.

I saw something today that makes me think I can make it happen.  Judt give 1% more each day.  You can increase your self by like 35% if you do that.  If you do 1% less it doesnt drastically change in the short term.  So the gains are easy, you just have to do a little extra work.  That's going to be the way I operate in 2020.

I quit a seven year habit for 65 days.  I came down with a nasty sinus infection, the worst of my life, about two weeks ago...I am still blowing the after effects out my nose today.  The terrible sinus headaches caused me to relapse to try and relieve the pain.  
I started using 4grams once a day for 2 days, I tried to take as little as possible...it helped but not enough, just took the edge off.  The effects wore off after about 12 hours so I increased to 4.5 grams every 12 hours, or 9 gpd.
I have wanted to take more but really trying to keep the dose low.  At this point two weeks into relapse, the effects only lasting 8 hours now and fighting the last few hours until my next dose, starting to see dependence increase.  

When I used before I had to take 3 times a day minimum, because withdrawals would start between doses.  After two weeks I am seeing issues and struggling to keep usage at a fixed level.  The cold is almost gone now.

Lessons learned-  
It was not possible to use once a day for relief for someone with a prior addiction.  
Relief only lasts 8 hours at the two week mark. 
Dependence started to return at about two week mark, I noticed withdrawals intensifying.   I was fairly stable before at 3 times a day 5 grams, it is weird how the body naturally seeks to return to that amount.  
Even trying to actively keep dose low, it increases fast.

The plan-
I will be quitting again in a few days, as soon as I get some ambien to help with sleep.  I plan to use lope ( to taper for a week) and ambien at night to sleep.  I plan to write a detailed account of my quit.  I hope this information is helpful for others dealing with relapse or folks that are contemplating relapse.  

If I had to do it over again, I would just endure to pain, the relief from the kratom was pretty weak and not worth the relapse.  Even after using lightly for 3 weeks, the withdrawals will suck when I quit again.",5,1

I started taking Kratom 5 years ago starting with a little bit but then worked up and up and up more and more, you know how it goes. Needless to say, I was just slamming the green dirt down around the clock, so much so that the yawning, sneezing, hot/cold waves would start in as little as \~8 hours from the last dose. I barely even felt anything with any dose.

So early in 2019 my family booked a 2 week international vacation 6 months out to a country I'll leave unnamed. I did a bit of research and found out that sure enough kratom is illegal in this country. I sure as hell wasn't going to try to smuggle anything through customs so I thought ""okay well that means I have 6 months to taper off so I can make it through this trip."" But of course I could not control myself and basically was taking the same amount right up to the point we were going to leave.

So now I'm thinking ""Welp, I'm fucked. This vacation is going to \*suck.\*"" However, having come back from this vacation a month ago, I'm here to say that I made it through and the acute WDs over the course of this vacation were really not too bad (especially for the high dose per day I was taking). I still did experience them, but I would describe them as minor. I don't really feel like I'm experiencing PAWS too much in the time since but I do exercise quite a bit and I think that probably is what helps a lot. Here were the things I did to make it through and the factors I think that mattered hopefully this might help someone else. This may not work for everyone, and may not seem like a good idea to everyone but I basically had no choice. I think the fact that I was going to have absolutely no access to kratom was going to be the only way I was ever going to be able to quit.

Some notes...

* I looked up everything on this forum as to stuff that might help and eventually landed on deciding I'd need to bring 3 things along: Black Seed Oil, Magnesium Citrate for RLS, and Immodium. I did take quite a bit of each of these over the course of the trip so I cannot confirm which of these made a difference. But that's what I brought along.
* The plane ride over was 9 hours long so I brought about 12g worth of kratom caps in my pocket to the airport went to bathroom swallowed them all down with a bottle of water and said ""Okay, here it goes. No way back now"" before going through TSA inspections
* The trip was going to be a huge time zone jump but I was able to sleep about 1-2 hours on the plane. When we landed my internal clock was at about \~3am my time, but it was 4pm local time so after going through customs and getting baggage. I got on a shuttle that was going to be a 1.5 hour ride to the hotel. I was dozing off on the shuttle a little bit and started to feel the RLS. Once we got to the hotel I took 3 BSO caps, 2 mag citrate caps, and 4 immodiums (8 mg). I generally took this same regiment of stuff 3x per day (morning, midday, and night).
* So it was 4pm local time, so we went out and got dinner. I did drink a fair amount of alcohol on this trip. I know that's not a good thing as it just serves as a replacement for my addictive personality and can make the RLS worse at night but it did take the edge off as I was now having the hot/cold waves and was definitely uncomfortable. After this we kinda just walked around a little bit near the hotel. Then went back to try to get some sleep at 9 or 10 pm to try to get on local time.
* First night was the worst. Definitely felt hot and cold and RLS and had insomnia I woke up at about 1am local time but I was so tired only having slept 1-2 hours in 24 hours that I was able to fall back asleep and wake up around 3am fall alseep again then wake up 5 am. I took my regiment of pills and played on my phone until it was time for breakfast
* The plan on this trip was to pack a lot of sightseeing and stuff in all day long everyday and we were going to be walking a \*lot\* (7 - 9 miles a day in between train rides to get around). I think is what was probably one of the biggest factors was on this trip as far as making the WDs seem not too bad. Because...

1. All the walking meant my legs were absolutely spent by the end of the day I think that really helped with the RLS at night and the insomnia. I think all the exercise possible helped with the body aches, yawning and the sneezing too. I still had them, but it didn't seem like that much.
2. Distraction. I know this forum talks a a lot about having a distraction when going through WDs All the sightseeing was my distraction
3. I think it also really helped that it was winter and cold outside in this country and we were outside all the time. That made the hot/cold waves easier to deal with. I had a big jacket and a lot of layers. When the hot came I took stuff off, when the cold came I put layers on. I can't imagine how uncomfortable it'd be being in hot weather when the hot waves come and being unable to cool down

* Diarrhea - This was going to be a huge concern for me. Would I be able to find a bathroom in time when we were going to be out and about all day? Fortunately though I was really lucky that I only had to go in the morning a few times after waking up. Even with all the immodium I was taking, my poops in the morning were sometimes like yogurt or pudding texture, but by day 3 it was straight butt water. I really tried to eat minimally at every meal and I think that helped make it so I only had to go in the morning. It definitely made me fairly hungry all the time with all the walking so that sucked, but it's better than the alternative of shitting my pants.

So anyway day 2... 3... 4... went by. I definitely still felt the WDs but it was surprisingly not too bad due to the above factors. I'm not sure I can say how much my pills helped, but I certainly don't think they hurt. By day 5 or 6 my poops were getting more solid again and I felt more comfortable eating more at each meal and I was now starting to feel a lot better. The rest of the vacation went by and we flew home. I slept about 7 hours on the plane

Not going to lie, I took Kratom when I got back home. After all, I just had a 2 week tolerance break so I'm going to be able to feel it again right? Nope. Barely felt a thing, just as it was when I was taking it constantly. So it was at that point I said ""Fuck this shit. I got through acute WDs and I'm not going back to having no energy, and WDs if I don't dose every 6-8 hours or so and I'll save a shitton of money as well.""

I know the temptation will always be there to go back or go to something else, but fortunately I have this great forum to stay motivated. It has been a few weeks since I got home from this vacation I'm feeling much better these days. I don't think I really have much in the way of PAWS, but as mentioned before, I do run about 3-5 miles a day and I think that makes a big difference.

Anyways, that's my story and that's what seemed to work well for me. Just wanted to share it in case anyone else wanted to give something like that a go to try to quit if they have an upcoming vacation.",2,0

So, I'm well aware of the addiction potential for Phenibut and only plan to take it once every 5 days. The last thing in the world I want is to get addicted to a worse substance than Kratom, so I'm going to be EXTREMELY cautious with my dosing and stop if there's ANY signs I'm getting addicted. When I first started tapering it was unbearable and I almost gave up. I started some supplements which helped a lot, but ever since getting below 22 gpd it's become pretty unbearable again. I've been lowering my dosage by 1.5g every 3-7 days.

Other than any general tips or other advice, my main question is if I should continue to taper at this rate or try for a faster taper? Thanks and happy New Year: -)

Edit: If anyone with experience or knowledge could answer the question about whether they think I should try tapering faster while using Phenibut I'd really appreciate it. I appreciate the warnings etc, but I'm 100% certain I won't allow myself to get addicted to Phenibut and will stop it immediately at the slightest sign of addiction. When I make up my mind about something, I've followed through EVERY single time in my life. So more cautionary comments aren't necessary, which is what I hoped to convey in my original post lol. Thanks for the input thus far though guys.",0,0

Yesterday I had little to no hope damn near about to quit quitting! The RLS was really new to me since I only ever smoked weed and never dealt with withdrawals before I really was freaking out . I smoked some weed last night and RLS reduced by 80% the muscle pain is bearable maybe because I’m used to meditating and it helps discipline the thought of pain being illusion ... but no control over when my muscles move was pretty damn frustrating... it’s really slowing down a lot ! 30 days don’t seem as far now that I came this far . Today makes day 20 on nofap as well so maybe the recovery will be faster as far as anxiety and stuff , I’ve done nofap before a few times (latest streak 170 days) and my confidence was through the roof , I just had a bad kratom habit so I’d get horny a lot and that’s how I relapsed there . So this time I want to have no attachments and live a pure clean life ! The hard days are just making us stronger in the long run and really building up an insane will ! It’s pretty amazing to me that the universe created our bodies to heal from anything , stay strong warriors !",6,0

Been medium / heavy user for 5 years been here before with opioids I know the drill.  RLS worst thing for me I’m usually anxious and depressed even with Kratom so whatever but need to sleep. Headed to pharmacy soon any good products and CVS? Would have gotten sooner and online but quitting was a bit spontaneous. Been tapering for weeks due to GI issues and ruling things out the only thing I haven’t quit is Kratom and need to see if that’s why I’m not better. Thank you.,11,0

This is seriously the move if you are ever struggling to sleep, just get up and do something, it's so much better than torturing yourself in bed.

I stopped taking klonopin yesterday and have started lowering my gabapentin dose, the plan is to not be on ANYTHING (except cannabis lol, love it too much and I don't get dependent on it) so I'm slowly lowering my dose. I also took around 6mg of Imodium because my stomach was churning and was giving me some issues.

This part is the real struggle, when you feel just ""okay"" again. Okay is not enough for my brain, it craves other things. So I've been playing my Xbox and binge watching Harry Potter movies, I just pretend I have a flu or something, allow myself to do this stuff while I have the time off work and just push through. 

I have to admit, cravings are starting to show, but I've put measures in place that make it damn near impossible to run to the shop and get some. I gave my dad my bank card and all the gift cards I got for xmas, everyone knows about my addiction (friends and family) so there is no sneaking to get it. This is super important for me because my addict brain WILL justify going to buy more, you know, *one last time...* right. Not happening.  Just gotta push through and stay occupied.

Happy new year to everyone, I wish all you Jan. 1st quitters the very best, you can do this! It's not as bad as you think, actually the dwelling on quitting was worse tbh. With proper planning and such you can make it quite painless, do your research, talk to people on here (I am free to talk most any time so feel free to hit me up on here or chat) and put a plan into place. If you feel you can handle a taper, do that, it makes things a lot less painful when you jump off (so i've heard, I've only CT'd) And if you are going the CT route, bless you, you can do it, it's just a few days of shit to get the rest of your life back. STAY STRONG! You made a commitment to treat yourself well and create a better life, this is the first step, stay on the path!

That's all I got, much love and respect to everyone in the fight!",13,0

Railed half a blue m30 in celebration of NYE and that whole self talk of “just make it start 2020, fuck if you already past acutes just do it tonight. OD’d in the in n out parking lot. 3 beats per minute and oxygen saturation below 40%. Shouldn’t have made it. Wouldn’t have really cared if I didn’t make it, but happy I did. 

Someone passing by was able to tell something wasn’t right and called 911. Wouldn’t be alive if it wasn’t for that person. 

I’ve always had trouble quitting in the past because I haven’t had too many negative consequences (especially with the law) but somehow got a DWI as well. Whole family at the ER in minutes. Unbelievable they still care after everything I’ve put them through. 
Just rambling. What a crazy night. 

I say this because it gives me a god damn reason to stop this shit for good. Kratom or any other drug for that matter. I was probably going to die tonight and for some reason, someone out there has a different plan for me. I will not take this second chance for granted. I will be better.",4,0
