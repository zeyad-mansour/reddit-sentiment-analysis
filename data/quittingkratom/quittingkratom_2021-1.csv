I am off work for 14 days and am going to attempt to CT Kratom. I tried to quit before (failed twice) and it was extremely unpleasant. I am really terrified of facing withdrawal yet again.","I really want to see what life would be like off of Kratom for good. The longest I made it before was 2 days off. The CRAVINGS, depression, RLS/insomnia, anger/irritability and anxiety symptoms was **really** **intense**. It doesn't help I had these mental health issues long before I ever used anything, so the withdrawal magnifies these. I've also been through Opiate WD hundreds of times in my life as a former heavy Opie addict (pills, dope, suboxone...etc quit all those in 2018). So my body is historically ""primed"" for this negative reaction. I feel this makes Kratom WD much worse than it should be

I've tried tapering many times but I lack self control to see it through. Lowest I managed was 7 GPD before giving up.... I'm an ""all of nothing"" type of addict. With **just 13 days remaining** before I return to work, I figure I should just jump off instead of beating around the bush at this point.

**Will I still have insomnia/sleeping issues 13 days off of Kratom?** I work full time in a factory setting and I am 100% physically dependent on K for energy/stamina to the point I'd stay home if I didn't have any K for the workday. I take Kratom before work, during x2 and once before bed to sleep for the next day.

**4 doses x 3-4 Grams per dose for the last 31 months.**

Most of all I'm worried if I do quit, I'll end up relapsing because there's multiple shops nearby selling decent quality stuff.  I don't feel very confident in myself so I feel like I'm setting myself up for failure before I even began.",10,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.87706774}"

On the 27th, the last night my wife and I stayed in the hospital, our baby was allowed to stay in the room with us. It was time for my kratom dose and I took it while looking at my sleeping baby and couldn’t help but feel guilty. It occurred to me that part of packing a bag for my wife’s labor included capping pills of this stuff, reminding me of my constant need for this green powder. I couldn’t go anywhere without some close by. I couldn’t do much without having dosed first. It’s been making me lazy and overall feeling like I’m in a fog. Hell, some nights as of late ive been having panic attacks that I attribute to it as well, because they go away just as I dose again. Well enough is enough. 

We come home the next day and I don’t take any. I felt ok, a little off, but knew w/ds wouldn’t start until maybe day 2. I rode it out. Sleepless night mainly from the baby screaming every 2 hours for food. Day 2 comes and goes. A little worse but not by much. Runny nose and lots of yawning. I started to feel the aches coming on. I look at my son and despite strong urges to dose, I hold strong and think about how he needs ME and not ‘me on kratom’. 

Day 3 I wake up. I’m feeling it for sure. Wife still doesn’t know I quit. Today’s been pretty shitty if I’m being honest. You know the deal, the whole list of w/d symptoms. I even almost threw up my dinner. RLS is starting. I’ve tried quitting 2 times before in my 2 1/2 years of use and have made it right to this point only once and dosed after being unable to sleep. Not this time, I will continue to not use. I’ll be awake anyway to give the baby his bottle so forget about sleep. I feel this is no longer for me, but for my family. 

All this devotion and determination aside, I want to dose so very badly right now. I know that it would take away all these bad feelings even if only temporarily. It’s funny how the brain will trick you into these thoughts. If I think about dosing I can already feel my brain glowing in a way. It’s a mental battle really. Sure the physical w/ds suck, but mentally is where I feel drained the most. I’m going to take it day by day. Hour by hour. Even minute by minute if I have to. I can do this, we can do this.

Totally freaked out. Like how can I possibly stay off it if he’s doing it?? I love him and I told him that if he takes kratom it won’t work but then I think...isn’t that a bit hypocritical of me?

Not really good, not a my-normal-happ-worry-free-self-kinda-day, but much better than the horrible 55 days before. Depression and Anhedonia made my life miserable every single day and I had to force myself to do anything. And I literally mean anything. Going to work 6 days the week was extremely unpleasant, but better than being home on my day off.

Exercise and Supplements did not really help and eating better, healthier food than I normal eat made no real difference either. I am NOT suggesting to skip those “Big 3”, not at all, since it works for 99% of people, but for me it just didn’t. Unless it did, and otherwise I would not have that day today, but usually people here seem to feel improvement instantly to some degree especially after the exercise. If you, like me, don’t feel any improvement after a month and more (...and even so you are doing the Big 3) do not give up. It will happen, but it just needs more time. Again: what works for others and helps many, might not help you. But one thing will help each and every one of us: the great healer called Time. I might be many things, but one thing I am most definitely not: patient. So I had to learn to be just that. If I can, you can too.

The first 2 months after quitting were EMPTY and sucked but then after a while the color of my world came back. To some, Kratom doesn't seem to have this horrible effect, but to me it was serious. I had to get off. My wife was the trigger for me to quit and we both dumped it down my toilet. Lol that thing stayed green for some time.

I had a 8 year addiction to heavy opiates but have been off opiates for almost 4 years now. After 2 years of being clean I had a weird case of depression; bad lethargy, no motivation, felt ""dumber"" like I had lost a big portion of my vocabulary, had a hard time putting sentences together which caused me to not want to be in social situations. Tried all types of antidepressants but never felt any effects besides initial anxiety. I felt nothing would help me. Even alcohol had no effects on me anymore for social situation which was weird(I saw another redditor posts similar symptoms and said kefir changed his/her life). This prevented me from bettering my life career wise so I resorted to trying kratom again and found alot of benefits with some of my symptoms mainly mood.
Fast forward a year and a half later and a daily usage of up to 40-50 gpd. I've resulted to buying kratom straight from a vendor that produces headshop kratom and actually really liked it for the price up until about a few months ago the quality changed. I figured it was time to take a break. So I quit CT about 2 months ago and got to about day 5 and had to take some because I had a job interview and just could not do it with the way I was feeling. Even though symptoms weren't too bad just really bad RLS, and slight lethargy throughout the day I couldn't do an interview/practical especially for my dream job. After that I've pretty much been using another headshop brand that rhymes with rumble dee and was a little better than the crap quality I was getting. The week break definitely lowered my tolerance for initial dose but I found that I had to take booster doses throughout the day so it kind of added up in the end. Anyways I decided I was over it and wanted to start getting back in the gym as well but constantly feeling like crazy from kratom hindered that plan so I decided to get off. 2 weeks ago I stopped CT again this time I had some supplements and uses kava for sleep which allowed me to get at least 4 hours of sleep every night I was able to manage throughout the day with my physically demanding job got to day 5 and started feeling a little more shifty lethargic so I decided to take a little tianeptine sulphate and then the next day same thing happened but was a little worse so I took tianeptine again then on the 7th day I was hoping to feel some relief but it was the same if not worse so I couldn't stand it anymore and decided to take kratom and regroup and research more. So since last Tuesday I've been back on kratom and taking the same headahop brand ""BB"" and feel relief maybe for an hour and have to take even more and keep chasing to just feel better and hasn't even improved my sleep. I'm frustrated! 
So my question is did I start to feel even more shitty on days 6 and 7 because of the tianeptine? (130mg wasn't even in a good mood just to get me out of the funk) has anyone else's withdrawals got worse on days 5,6,7? The kava also really helped with sleep but I had to take alot and I ended up getting really dry face so I didn't take it at all this week. When I added BSO I felt it helped the first time I took it but would only work like every 3rd time I took it? I also have gabapentin and clonidine. But I have to take high amounts of gaba to get any kind of relief as I was prescribed this for a while. Last there is no way I can taper with this shit headshop k. I read about stem and vein was thinking if it's worth to order some s&v from a reliable online source with some better quality k and have better luck. Or..... do I even need to do that as I was able to handle the first 5 days no prob last time. I know alot of it is in my head as I've come off suboxone before and kratom is nothing compared to that or H. Sorry for the rant. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I have mild anxiety and issues with energy and tiredness. I can’t drink coffee, it actually makes me fall asleep like ten min after drinking it and overall not feel well. So anyways, started taking k. I had lose powder. I would measure out 1/4 teaspoon doses at a time. I would do about 4 a day. Some days I did more, some less. Max was probably 3 tsp throughout the day. Sometimes I would start my day off with it, other days I wouldn’t take any till the afternoon. I did notice a tolerance forming so I would take up to three days off at a time. I liked taking it before workouts cuz I would just zone out and work really hard. At some point I did notice that if I didn’t take any till the afternoon I would start to get a headache, then I’d take some and it would go away. It didn’t really register with me what that meant, I had developed a physical dependence. Without really thinking about it I started taking it every day. I started getting irritable if my dose wore off. At this point I was taking an average of 1.5 teaspoons per day. Then in the fall I was up to about three teaspoons per day. I would taper up and down because my tolerance would build and I wouldn’t be getting the affect from it I wanted. Then I had a very stressful week about a month and a half ago and without really realizing it started taking about 6 tsp per day. When my life chilled out after about a week of this I naturally just started taking less. But I was getting splitting headache when my dose wore off. I took just enough to keep the headache away and after a while went back to taking 1-1.5 tsp through the day. Though I no longer got the strong euphoric and energy I used to from it. A few more times my dose went up for a few days and then I would bring it back down again. When I was bringing it back down I would have insomnia and headache. About two weeks ago I was like ‘what am I even doing’ I never had what I would call ‘cravings’ and this substance was more trouble then it was worth. I had taken it every day for about 4 months at this point (the 4 months before that were probably 3-5 times a week). So I didn’t take any and by that evening I had a splitting headache, was exhausted but couldn’t fall asleep. I took a very small amount, probably 0.5 g, and was able to sleep a little bit. For the next week I took 0.5g once a day. I was so miserable. Headache, fatigue, insomnia, anxiety, cold sweats. Then on the 26th of Jan I stopped completely. I have had the full list of WD symptoms. All except actual cravings. Reading people’s post on here has helped a lot. I felt compelled to chime in because I was using way less then the vast majority of posters on here. My highest doses were probably 8 gpd and I would only do that a few days in a row. Most of my usage was 5 or way less. But I am still expecting very uncomfortable WD. I often bought it in oz packages and that would last me 2 weeks or even a bit longer. I read about Kratom before I started and was like ‘ok just don’t take 40 gpd and you are good’. I was definitely wrong. I’m 5 days without right now, the last three days have been super rough. But hopefully I’m getting through the worst of it. I wish I would have known more about this stuff before I took it for the better part of a year.",11,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.48142013}"

So I started using daily last April. I had just started a new job as a grocery store worker and had taken Kratom in the past. Didn't really think about it, I just took some with some OJ my first morning and it was absolute bliss. Did it again every day for the next 2 weeks. It turned me into some sort of endless ball of energy. I was incredibly emotive and understanding with customers, I could use my body like some sort of tool without any sort of payback. Anyhow, maybe a month after I started daily use (and going hard as hell at work) I injured my back. Badly. I was out for about a week, got some steroids and just tried to take it easy. At first I could hardly walk, sit in the car, or even lay down without being in pain. I started going to physical therapy, and continued to do so 3 times a week for months, literally months. I finally plateaued and was fully mobile again, but all the while I had been using daily and going hard at work.

I kepy trying to stop but couldn't, I had to take Kratom to dull the pain. I just stopped a few days ago after a long chat with my partner who has been an absolute light through all of this insanity. She works in the public health and neuroscience field and has had A LOT of powerful and helpful things to say along the way. So here I am, just under a week in. I got X-Ray scans of my lower back just to make sure that nothing is broken since the pain has been going on for around 8 months. Nope, everything is fine. I just keep telling myself that the kratom was causing the pain and that as I get distance between it and I things will get better. Taking ibuprofen, stretching, restarting PT. Any additional advice would be greatly appreciated. Just keep telling myself I won't live the rest of my life in pain because of some dumb fucking decisions I made. We'll see.

I need strength



3 year habit and I thought I wasn’t gonna make it out of the acutes. It just kept going on and on and the pain in my brain was so bad I kept wanting to relapse. 

The first four days I couldn’t make it to the bathroom without fainting. Yesterday I could pour myself water and get to the bathroom ok. If I didn’t have my partner I couldn’t have survived this.

I slept about 4 hours and awoke fearing the intense pain was going to come back but it’s just gone now. Just a little low level headache and still feeling weak. I know I’m not out of the woods yet but it feels amazing to have made it here.

Never touching that insidious shit ever again. I just want everyone to know that the pain will end and it is worth it. It’s the worst shit I’ve felt in a long time, but it does end. to those of you still in the throes of acutes right now, I hope you can find the strength to get through this time.

I was using kratom as a crutch during my benzo withdrawal and had to stop it 2 weeks ago.  


A little background on me. I had started taking benzos in 2010 for panic disorder. I had also started taking kratom around 2015 to help with my mood and depression as I knew opioids made me happy.    


Well 3 years ago I decided I wanted to stop relying on substances. The klonopin would send me into nasty interdose withdrawals or I would end up in the ER and I knew that if I didn't take kratom I would be absolutely worthless in the morning and non functional all day and go into kratom withdrawal.  


Well, three years ago I began to taper off klonopin. I tapered off of it over a period of 3 years. I had gotten off klonopin but I kept taking kratom and never stopped taking kratom the entire time I tapered and was off klonopin.  


I am now 9 months off klonopin and I had to quit taking kratom 2 weeks ago. Kratom helped with my anxiety for a long time until it slowly started turning against me. It was making me psychotic. I was having intrusive mental images, looping intrusive thoughts, and I believed I was possessed by Satan. I was literally carrying around a cross in my room at night in the dark praying to God and telling Satan to leave my body.   


Now, this is mostly benzo withdrawal but my point is is that I seriously believe kratom was messing with my brain. I am in a vulnerable state with benzo withdrawal and the kratom was intensifying everything. I think kratom is okay if someone with a healthy brain uses it sparingly. Not someone who is damaged from pharmaceuticals and has pre existing anxiety and depression.  


Anyways, I had ended up in the hospital in a behavioral unit and told them and they told me I needed to stop taking kratom. So 14 days ago I stopped. I experienced restless legs for a few nights and some diarreah but that was about it. My benzo withdrawal is so bad that I didn't even really notice the kratom withdrawal. I had already been pacing around my room for weeks with anxiety because of the benzos and I had nothing left to lose. So I said fuck it and I quit.   


Anyways, since I quit the intrusive images have pretty much stopped, the OCD looping thoughts stopped. I'm still left with disturbing mental symptoms but the really crazy stuff I had while taking kratom had stopped. I just wanted to come on here and join in on the quitting kratom forum and let everyone know that. I hope you're all doing well and wish you luck on your journey getting off of the sludge.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5255555}"

2021-01-30 01:31:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/l8fref/capsules_vs_powder/,Capsules vs. Powder,"Hello, all. So, I felt like I'd just simply quit kratom after getting  surgery. I had nearly two weeks off, but I felt I was not sleeping well at all. I was constantly waking up. Sleep is tough enough since my sleep schedule swings at two different times each week due to work. I couldn't see how I could live and take care of a young daughter without sleeping. Part of the reason I don't think the time off helped me kick it was the use of pain meds at the hospital and after (though for just less than a week). So truly, I probably had a week off. Perhaps I could have waited it out but I did not. A blessing and a curse is that my wife found out about my kratom use, so I am no longer hiding it, though I am still embarrassed and attempt to not have her see me use it. 

I am very serious about quitting, but the surgery I got was a gastric sleeve. This makes taking the powder a very long process and I have thrown up multiple times.

I believe me solution to fixing this would possibly be looking to making my own capsules .5g. The good news is that the amount I am doing has decreased and it seems to have gone down by quite a bit. I measured my dose and it was 4.4g. I swear I was over 10g per dose before that, and at least did 15g a day. I am more comfortable doing this twice a day, since that will allow me to avoid a period of time where I will have chills and feel icky (and cut into my sleep), though I can make it down to 4.4g a day or so and not be utterly miserable. 

\*\*question\*\*: is there going to be any real practical difference between capsules and powder for me, or does this seem like a viable solution. It's the only way I can think about keeping consistently with a taper. I cannot see my weighing it out multiple times a day, everyday.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44313085}"

I was steady on pills in my teens and was hooked on IV heroin amongst other things all throughout my 20's. Did a half year+ of sober living and working programs about 4 years ago, and actually got kicked out because the manager found some kratom bottles stashed in my dresser. I justified using kratom because I checked myself in and had a job along with all the answers and felt like I knew better than everyone else. Blah blah. Anyways kratom turned me into a new kind of beast. I look back and can't believe how mean I was to people I really care(d) about, and how much of an absolute PSYCHO I was at certain points at different jobs, not to mention how literally everything outside of working and sitting on my ass eating kratom wasn't a priority. 

With all this on my mind for the better part of the last couple years, I've made a few half-hearted efforts at quitting, or at least cutting my dosage down, along with a major effort at the start of corona. I got down to about 14 grams I believe, then went right back up. I hated that I was still addicted to something, and the way it makes me feel like a prisoner, and I always had plans of getting off, but I also struggle with some mental health issues along with my history of being addicted to ""real"" drugs that make it really easy for me to justify kratom. Well that all changed in October when I started having severe medical issues (I eat well and run 5 miles 4-5 times a week, thought I was healthy). I figured kratom was the culprit as the issues seemed to stem from my liver/kidneys, and I began a rapid taper. I got down to 12 gpd and had a flare up of symptoms again and went back up to unregulated dosing for a few days, which seemed to make the symptoms even worse, so I continued to taper. Sub 12 gpd things got really hard but my symptoms let up again, and so did my drive to keep lowering my doses. 

Well I came clean to my GP and he ordered a bunch of tests and we set up another appointment date about a month out, and I agreed to be off kratom by that time. I rescheduled twice because well, I'm an addict. My next appointment is on Feb 4th to discuss the test results. I have actually been dropping .1 off of each of my 2 doses for the past couple of weeks and had gotten down to 6.4 GPD. If I had more time I feel I could easily continue at this pace, as I've already been sitting at a fairly low dose for a couple of months and am used to always being a little in withdrawal, and the .2 drops per day are really not that bad, surprisingly. Anyways I read my test results online yesterday and it looks like I could have a very real very serious liver issue. I'm freaked out and am sure that there will be more tests so I want to be completely off kratom by my appt come hell or high water. 

Thank you to anyone who bothered reading all this. It was cathartic getting this stuff off my chest. Today was day 1, I'm about 30 hours in and feeling alright. I'm sure I won't sleep tonight but if that's all I have to deal with I'll be ok. I was sneezy and yawny and achy and weak today, but generally optimistic. We'll see if tomorrow is the beast I think it has the potential to be, or if my 4 month taper will allow me to escape the worst of it. Either way I'm going to stay strong and will probably be checking in for the next couple of weeks. Any words of encouragement are appreciated, thanks for reading.",12,{'rona': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6481451}"
2021-01-30 00:12:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/l8ej24/tomorrow_is_the_day/,Tomorrow is the day,"I quit kratom back in late 2016 and stayed quit until July of 2020. COVID made for an easy excuse to entertain the thought of going back to it, even though I knew better. I am an addict to most anything I get my hands on. The largest issue I have faced in that realm is debilitating alcoholism. I quit drinking 10 years ago and have not picked up since, but other things like kratom have continued to be an issue for me.

It's interesting the mental gymnastics addicts (me) will do to justify using again. It's the same old story time and time again. Same old thought processes leading up to it. Like clockwork. Throughout the years, and with counseling, I have garnered tools to help deal with those thoughts and inklings, but this time around I chose to ignore all that and pick it up again. It will be fiiiine, right? Nope.

After just a few days I knew I was back in the same pattern of (ab)use as in the past. 2 scoops is never enough, gotta have another. And so tolerance builds, I take more, you know how it goes.

I am probably averaging 30ish grams per day, dosing 3x a day. Sometimes topping off a bit after. Of course that pretty much does nothing, but addiction always wants you to do more and more. I haven't been weighing it out because quite frankly I don't care. I buy 8oz per week and it'll last the week.

I am sick in the morning. I feel like trash until I dose. I have so far had to stop my car on two separate occasions while traveling to vomit on the side of the road. I eat around my dosing. I now eat much less than I used to on account of losing appetite and wanting an empty-ish gut for the drug. Only potential upside there is I have shaved off a few pounds from the ""COVID 15."" Oh yeah, and I have to take laxatives to poop right.

I think about taking kratom all the time. It runs my life right now, not me. My depression and other mental health issues are not being well-served by continuing to take it. Of course, I already knew that would be the case. I have OCD and a fixation on numbers. Needless to say, with that condition amplified, it's been difficult to pick a quit date and really stick with it.

I am tired. I hate it. It's not even enjoyable anymore and hasn't been for a while now.

I have hid this from my wife, who was there for me when I kicked it in '16, and if she found out it would very likely cause serious issues with my marriage. I am just not willing to take the risk anymore or betray my wife's trust further. I must have some semblance of control again in my life.

I have of course tried a few times to quit recently, but they didn't take or were half-assed. Tomorrow is the day. January 30, 2021. Cold turkey. I took Monday off so I have a 3 day weekend with no responsibilities.

I found this subreddit back when I quit in 2016. It was immensely helpful just to know I was not alone in this addiction. I have never posted, but felt like this time it would be helpful for me to tell a bit of my story in case it resonates with anyone.

I thank everyone for your meaningful contributions to this forum. It will yet again be a big source of comfort in this upcoming struggle to kick this shit.

My acutes lasted less than 12 hrs and we're very mild compared to the first time I CT'd about a year prior. That time was hell for 3 days but I got off easy this time.

The hardest part for me was the low energy. I've relied on kratom to work long hours and I took the entire week off work to not be tempted into using.

I run a business with 20 employees and the energy from kratom was the most addicting part, so the low energy following CT has been difficult.

Plus I live in Bali where a KG of powder can be ordered to your house for $7USD. No financial incentive to quit here, lol.

I put a lot of work into my recovery of energy, gym, sauna, ice bath every day for week one.

Supplementation and good food instead of alcohol and junk food like I used last CT, just making things worse.

One thing I noticed an immediate improvement in my mood was high dosing vitamin D supps + sun bathing at least 10 mins. I theorized that my levels were low because I was feeling similar to how a dark winter with no sun used to make me feel, down and lethargic.

It worked instantly to bring energy back to fairly normal levels.

Kratom was possibly masking that issue or affecting my uptake?

I still don't have as much energy as when I was slamming kratom all day to work, but happy to be free of the nasty side effects and psychological chain of never being able to go anywhere without my stash and fear of traveling because I'd be forced to go through withdrawal when going to any country it's illegal (which is a lot).

Anyways, thought I'd share this experience as most stories on here hype up the really bad effects and I actually didn't struggle so bad, especially compared to my first CT.

I am so grateful this sub exists, and even more grateful for everyone’s support and shared experiences here.

I got a full physical and blood work up done.  Everything is healthy.  I just have lower good and bad cholesterol.  The doctor said it’s totally fine though, it’s just below threshold normal values.  I have no idea how my health is largely good.  Meeting with a sleep doctor next month to tease out my perpetual sleep issues.  I don’t believe they are kratom related anymore, as I’ve never slept great.

Staying clean and sober is an every day thing.  I have to make the decision every day, sometimes multiple times a day.  Of course, some days are easier than others.  I’m getting more and more easier days with more time, which is from having a general uptrend in how I’m feeling.  Gratitude follows a similar cadence.  My default mode is to wake up and be fixated on have nots.  I’m trying to cultivate gratitude by reminding myself of what I have and that life is largely good.  I’m also trying to cultivate it with action, by showing how grateful I am by caring and tending to those things.  Showing that to my gf, cleaning my apartment, taking care of my duties as a grad student, etc... that’s making a big difference in my outlook on the world.

Now I come on here all the time saying that I don't miss kratom, kratom is bullshit, kratom high is a myth, fuck kratom very much... etc... But when I went into that store to grab smokes, I made eye contact with the kratom section and had to fight my weasel brain. At first glance, I could hear the weasel ""fuck it, you've been off it for 29 days. You deserve this. Imagine the one time high you could enjoy for the next 30 minutes. Nobody would even know. Just this once then back to sobriety tomorrow."" Ha! I can't say that I was in real danger of caving. I won't go back to this shit. Which speaks volumes about how pointless a drug kratom is. Because I'm a true addict and self control is not my strong point. God has always been merciful to me by not surrounding me with steady, easy access drugs or dealers. In the past when I was able to connect with a steady dealer, I'd wear them out before too long. I always paid (a smart addict always keeps his credit clean with dealers) but my constant phone calls and unannounced pop-ins would annoy even the most desperate dealers I suspect. My point is, I can admit that it might be tough for me to pass up drugs from my younger days if they were right in front of me like the kratom was earlier today. But kratom sucks. It makes it easier to say ""Fuck you weasel, you know what I mean... fuck you very much."" Stay strong people. Kratom addiction is surprisingly intense. Even hating kratom and just going through some of the most drawn out and draining w/d's I've ever experienced (and I assure you, I'm no rookie when it comes to withdrawal from a plethora of substances), it can still make you contemplate using it again.

Today I remembered something from my vegan days that actually might be really helpful to people in acute wds. There’s naturally occurring compounds in dairy called casomorphins. They are very similar in structure to morphine. When someone becomes vegan, the first month is typically the hardest because you actually go through withdrawals (very minor, mostly just cravings) from eliminating dairy from your diet. After 4-6 weeks, most vegans no longer have cravings from dairy because the wd has ended. When I stopped taking opiates ct years ago, I ate a TON of cheese, and it did help. If you are able to, try consuming dairy products as much as possible the first couple weeks of your wd. It may help alleviate some of the symptoms. I’m going to try to find some research to back this up. I’ll post some links in the comments.

I was a 30gpd user, been tapering and I’m down to about 12gpd. But it’s getting hard to taper lower. I have 3 kids home all day with online school and I’m finding myself getting real snappy with them when I’m nearing my next dose. I hate myself after being short with them because they’re just being kids. 
I was just wondering how bad it will be as I taper down lower, and how functional will I be when I finally jump off? I’m not taking any supplements right now. I train jui Jitsu 3x/week and so far I still have energy for that. It’s the only thing that keeps me from going insane sometimes. Anyways, sorry for the long rant.

So, I've only been using maybe 5grams tops every few days or so (quit my initial 30gpd habit last year but haven't been able to stay completely away since), and the only symptom when I try and stop is the SEVERE RLS. However, I'm wondering if what I'm feeling IS indeed RLS, or if maybe I have something else going on IDK. I didn't even feel what I feel now when I quit my 30gpd habit... 

For example, I went on a 6 day binge last week but only of about 5gpd and today is day 5 off and I thankfully don't have trouble sleeping or RLS AS MUCH at night, but allllllll day I feel this aching and throbbing pain in my legs. I can't keep my legs still at my desk job all day, but the concern is the throbbing aching all day and even into the night. It's so bad that if my boyfriend squeezes them it makes them feel better but if he literally hit them with a hammer I wouldn't mind.

Is that RLS??? Or should I be concerned that maybe I have some kind of circulation issue IDK.

I do feel a big difference from day 1. Very emotional. Getting out for a couple walks with my pups. I’m trying to eat. Mostly real foods bananas, nuts, mostly anything I can just eat without effort of preparing it. 

I should have done better research with supplements before I started CT. I know I have before. I also found Phenibut last time and learned that’s gonna make things worse. Im an addict. I am going to use substances that makes me feel better/different until it’s a problem. Same with Kava. I have wanted kava so bad from day 1. I won’t use it responsibly. Never have and never will. I just want to be sober. 

So the hardest part about this CT is I am barely sleeping. I remember from before but this seems worse. I am concerned that I have overdone the melatonin. I was reading about not taking to much because it can cause insomnia if your body stops producing it. I read that a couple days ago. I looked into it because the night before I could feel I was on the verge of sleep. So several times throughout the night I just got up and took 10-15mg of melatonin thinking this will push me over that sleepy edge. No such luck. So when I read that I decided I will take 10mg before bed and not anymore. It’s been a rough couple of nights. I should also say that before this I would usually take it daily and in my mind because it’s a natural sleep aid thought nothing of taking 20-30mg if I was up late and needed to get some sleep. 

The restless leg has been lesser of an annoyance this time. I don’t know why. I have it for sure just not as bad as I remember the first week of the last CT. So of course it makes me even more frustrated that I can’t sleep. 

I NEED HELP! 

Please tell me what helps you to sleep. The more natural the better. I have some chamomile tea, also another drink that helps with sleep. I have good sleep habits. I’m not on my phone before bed. Don’t even bring it in the room. 

I will say I did get like 4 hours last night. I was so sad when I woke up. I tried to keep my mind clear. But laying in bed awake made my mind crazy. Even though I have no energy to do much.  I can’t get back to sleep.

Should I check myself into a rehab center?

How long should I take off work to be able to go back and function normally in society?

what over the counter meds/and prescription meds should i ask my DR for to make this process  easier?

So I know this sub is mainly for those who have first hand experience with Kratom. But I'm on here because I really need advice on how to support my boyfriend who has been using (I think he's been using around 25-30gpd for the past 3 or so years, but I am not really sure because he usually tries to sneak his doses). Anyways, it has been killing me as someone who loves him deeply to see what he is going through and how much he struggles. He tried quitting cold turkey back in Sept of 2020 and I tried offering support and told him I was there for him even if I couldn't completely empathize because I had never experienced what he had. I think he felt embarrassed and he didn't want me to see him while he was withdrawing or treat me in a way he didn't want to. I wanted to give him his space but of course I was also worried sick about him. I tried to educate myself on everything possible regarding kratom, expected withdrawl symptoms/timelines, things that could help, reading about others experiences etc. but it was hard to find answers. I was able to check in with him a bit here and there while he was in the first week or so, when I heard the symptoms are supposed to be the worst, but I felt so helpless.

He seemed like he was trying to keep me in the dark about what he was going through almost as if he didn't want me to worry and he downplayed his situation. I think he was definitely in denial about the severity of his situation and was help rejecting causing him to not get the support he clearly needed which ultimately lead his relapse. It seemed to me that after around a month after he had quit cold turkey that he was mostly back to his normal self. However, around 6 weeks after he initially quit, I caught him dosing. After that he admitted that he had relapsed 2-3 weeks before I caught him and he told me he had been dosing everyday since. From that day forward and on he dosed right in front of me every day I was around him. I asked him if he plans on trying to quit again and he said maybe later and that he was probably going to try tappering out his doses instead but I don't know how serious he is about that. It just kills me because I know he wants to quit and I see how negatively kratom has been affecting him.

That day I caught him dosing was about 2 months ago. At first, I would sometimes make gentle remarks or questions about how he's feeling or ask for updates on if he's talking to his doctors, etc. But anytime I would even bring it up, even though it is in a nonjudgmental and supportive way, he would snap at me and shut me down so I backed off and now I just say nothing. I don't know where to go from here. I'm pretty stuck so I thought it would be a good idea to ask people who have experience trying to quit or those who have quit what helped them and how they would want their loved ones to support them during this time.",27,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6512214}"

I swapped to pills to get a more specific amount and I found at 6 pills I have no restless leg. I still have mild chills or sweat easily. But I'm not shaking my leg. I've been taking 6 every 3 hours, sometimes even 6, then 4. I've got muscle aches I believe, though I can't tell if the aches in my abs and leg are from shaking my leg and sitting around most of the time.

I find with 5 pills I've got a mild restless leg, but it's enough to keep me from sleeping. When I take 4 I have a fairly hardcore restless leg. Bad enough it's unbearable to lie down more than 4 to 5 minutes.

Am I making progress? I can't fucking tell. I can't deal with the restless leg cause I've gotta move houses in a few days. I know for a fact I'm using much less kratom per day than I was previously.

I was dosing about 30 gpd and taking extracts off and on.  A few months ago, in the fall, I was able to quit for 35+ days and I felt awesome about it, but somehow I fell back into this hole.  I felt like I was drowning.  I had to take kratom all day everyday, and the dosages kept rising to about 50 gpd when I finally had to pull the plug on this terrible habit a week ago.  Four days after quitting CT I found out I would be losing my job because of issues way out of my control and my place of work was being shut down.  I instantly wanted to relapse but somehow I found the strength to not.  It just isn’t financially sustainable.  It’s not even physically, mentally, or emotionally sustainable.  Being under the influence of kratom is just a sick, twisted illusion that you are a better person when you take it then the person you are when you are not taking it. 

The first few times I quit, I saw the light, but after falling into the green hole again, I found out how easily this plant, and whatever it does to your head, lies to you and twists everything into a lie.  I am 9 days sober and I am still lying to myself about why I took kratom and how it affected me.

I’ve been using kratom for about a year, and I consider it to have been a gift to me at a time when I was very mentally vulnerable to anxiety, depression, and generally poor mental health - a bad combination for me as the main caretaker of my children, home from school due to the pandemic. This was on the heels of what felt like a nervous breakdown a few years ago when I could barely function at all. Kratom allowed me to feel something happy and peaceful when anxiety felt like it was going to eat me alive and when I had spent so long feeling nothing but mental anguish and trauma. But I always knew it wasn’t a long term strategy for dealing with my issues. I’m ready to move on to the next chapter. Basically, life circumstances have dictated that I have to quit, so I have no choice but to be ready. I tried to quit a few weeks ago but it felt psychologically crushing, and my husband encouraged me to wait a little longer. But now it’s time, and I’m just ready to get it over with. 

It’s really hard. My last dose was yesterday midday, and last night the restlessness hit me like a truck. One of the main areas I feel it is in my left arm, more so than my legs. My arm hurt so badly that I couldn’t sleep. I was praying for relief, and then I had the idea of using a massage gun on my arm. It seemed like an unlikely solution, but I was too miserable not to at least try. I pulled the gun out of the closet and lay it beside me in bed, pressed up against my upper arm where it felt the worst. I turned the massage gun on and then wedged it in with pillows so it wouldn’t vibrate off the bed, all the while hoping I wasn’t waking up my husband with mysterious vibrating sounds... It actually worked. It wasn’t relaxing or anything, but it gave my arm so much relief because there was constant movement happening. When my legs and feet got restless I used the gun on them, too, and it made a big difference. I just wanted to share that in case it can help anyone else in a pinch. I also got an Audible subscription (the first month is free, I think) and have been listening to audio books during the day and night when I can’t sleep. It helps with the mental chatter. There’s only so long I can spend staring at my phone before that feels depressing, so audio books are a good distraction. 

Anyway, I don’t want to ramble. This is just a really scary thing to go through. I’m terrified that after I endure this awful week of physical pain and discomfort that I won’t have what it takes to be a good mom. I’m scared I won’t ever be happy without a substance. I’m scared anxiety will keep me a prisoner in my own home. And I want to talk about all this to my husband in real time (it’s stuff he knows) but he’s going through some things of his own right now so I don’t want to burden him. I knew you guys would understand. If you have any encouragement or helpful suggestions on how to survive, I would love to hear them.",13,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5664094}"

My kratom use became problematic in and of itself. After repeatedly using kratom for months at a time behind my wife's back and lying to her, I destroyed my marriage and am now separated with a pending divorce. 

Additionally, i have some physical health issues that I'm pretty sure are related to my kratom use (chronic constipation that lead me to see a GI doc, as well as this weird, persistent mental state where i frequently feel ""high"" or just really weird and out of it, even when I haven't taken any substances for days).

Throughout the last 2 years, I've been trying to create a healthier relationship with substances, including cutting kratom out for good. I've continued to struggle with it though. My patterns have been much less unhealthy compared to when I had daily use (using one dose about every week or 2). So i seem to have broken the daily use habit, but it seems like every couple weeks, I'll be feeling totally solid with no desire to use, and then get blindsided with a trigger/craving and suddenly in a matter of minutes I'm driving to the head shop and picking up.

Ironically, when my wife told me to move out, I'd been clean for a month and a half, probably my longest stretch since I started taking kratom in 2017. After moving out (which was Christmas eve), I did relapse, used somewhat heavily for a bit (like 4-5 days straight), cut it out but picked up on a couple of weekends, and am now 12 days without using it.

Between all my relapses on various substances, i don't really like to mark a clean date because I've found that when I fuck up, it just makes me feel worse.

That being said, I really want to take action to stay off that shit. It's caused so many problems in my life, and I want to find a life that I'm happy with and I know kratom is only going to hold me back from that. 

I was wondering- has anyone else experienced something like I described (frequently feeling weird and vaguely ""high"" even when not having taken a substance) after prolonged kratom use/attempts at quitting? I have discussed it with my doctor as well as several counselors/treatment providers but no one has a concrete answer. 

I've had blood labs done multiple times since it's been happening but nothing abnormal there. Some professionals have suggested that it might be anxiety, but the thing is, while the feeling itself sometimes causes me to feel anxious, there are many times where I simply notice it and am like ""ugh this again? Why do i feel fucked up when i know I'm not?"" but wouldn't say I'm particularly anxious or anything. Like, the feeling of weirdness/being high precedes any abject feelings of anxiety.

Anyway, i seem to have a habit of long and rambling posts... I'm feeling strong right now about staying quit, despite my relationship falling apart, but I've lurked here for awhile without ever posting and just thought I'd share my story a bit.

Started to quit a 6 year long perc addiction (again - actually was clean for a year then relapsed for a couple months then Kratom). At first, like for all of us, it was the miracle plant of wonders with zero consequences. The “where have you been all my life?!” 

But then I gradually upped and upped my dose and found cheaper and better Kratom so it didn’t really hurt me financially so why not take more? Until it was up to about 65gpd - which still didn’t bother me, who needs to poop? ha

My universal throat punch to stop however, is my hair and skin. I noticed in October at a hair appointment like “wow this feels really thin” and I’ve been complaining about needing Botox for months as well / just feeling like I look like the Crypt Keeper / can NOT really look at pictures. Super insecure, super self hate-y. And again, I’m like oh this must be covid depression duh, but I’m full of shit and it’s the Kratom. The last straw is/was my hair. So so devastated about this. (Hey it may be vain but whatever it takes.)

Anyway,

Tapered from 12-13 g/dose to 9 to 7 then back up to 9-10 over the last month. So from 9ish jumped down to 5-5.5 g/dose yesterday and isn’t **too** bad but def was tired / grouchy / my nose will **not stop** running. No RLS really (yay! My main reason for wanting to taper > CT) - just a constant Kleenex in my hand and some ehhh feelings.

FYI in the past I’ve withdrawn from nicotine, alcohol, stimulants, and opiates a few time but only successfully **with** Kratom (back when I was smart and used like 2gpd for 2 weeks then put it down).
Idk why I’m so scared of this withdrawal? Especially considering I have the luxury of not working right now and just doing online schooling/fake housewifing with a super supportive partner with tons of w/d experience. I think it’s bc I **hate** RLS so much / am low key worried about life without my crutch.

I want my hair back like yesterday, along with my skin and whatever my personality was before (again - hard to tell! bc also covid and also moved across the country away from all my networks and community).

TL;DR: Tapering off Kratom. Sick of Kratom. RIP @ my hair. Scared of RLS. Nose is runny AF.

I know there’s shit tons of info in here but looking for (quick) tapering advice/success stories. Hair loss advice/wins. RLS lifesavers. WTF I can take for my eternal nose run that won’t give me RLS (I bread antihistamines do? And maybe some socially distanced high fives if you feel so inclined.

PS I’m taking biotin / using a natural growth spray / ordered BSO & agmatine (sp?) to potentially just jump off this weekend.


Thanks so much and I am SO impressed by and proud of all of you with tons of days or weeks or even a few hours / those of us who are creeping hard and almost ready to be done with this shit,

I have been using Kratom daily for at least 2 or maybe 3 years, I really don't even know anymore. It has been a long time. I got to the point where I would take a dose before bed around 11pm and then wake up at 3am having to take another just to go back to sleep. I was probably taking around 40-50gpd. I got down to around 15-20gpd and then quickly jumped to 5gpd over the last week. 

I am now taking 2.5g around 6pm (this is when I start to get pretty uncomfortable) and 2.5g just before bed. I attempted to skip the bedtime dose the other day and the RLS was unbearable. It's actually worse in my hands and arms but for sure also present in my legs. 

The taper has definitely helped with WD. I have quit a few times before CT and the WD was horrible. I never lasted more than 1-2 weeks. I am feeling much better and I think I might go stop altogether this weekend. I am still having WD symptoms, the worst being the insomnia, RLS and a fast/heavy heartbeat. I am a little worried about WD once I cut out the bedtime dose.   


I am already feeling much less numb, and actually looking forward to feeling like a normal person again. I am really just hoping I can stick with it this time.

So far so good! Looking forward to kicking it to the curb. I use Kratom daily mostly as a crutch to limit my WD or anxiety from the Phenibut taper. 

Kratom has been in my supplement stack way longer than Phenibut I think I’ve been using daily since 2014 or so and have been everywhere from 10GPD to 20-25GPD. 

I’m not going to begin to taper or quit until after my Phenibut is done but would you all recommend a CT wand just insure the acute WD to rid as quick as possible or taper? 

The reason I’m leaning toward CT is, like Phenibut there is always that temptation to “reward” myself for a good streak. Which I have done a couple times now during my Phenibut taper and I don’t want to do the same with Kratom.

All I’ve read on (and experienced) is that compared to the Phenibut WD Kratom seems to be a little more forgiving, not to discredit or write it off because it will hurt for a while.

A blessing and a curse. People in this community want to quit kratom. And that is a beautiful thing. Addiction is simply terrible. I recently lost an old friend from high school who had been battling with addiction for years. Not kratom, but actual pain killers. But addiction is addiction. A domino effect. In life you can either go up the slope toward your goals, stay in the same place (which usually shifts in a bad direction for an addict), or fall behind because of a lack of purpose due to mental anguish, struggles with addiction, or other various reasons.

Times are tough right now, and I'm not one to complain. Things are just weird! Anyways, a lot of people are currently picking up bad habits or vices. Kratom has been around for a very long time. I have never seen it boom like it has lately. About a year ago most of my friends didn't know what kratom was. Now it seems that almost everyone I come in contact with knows about kratom. More people are using kratom now more than ever before.


Kratom changed me. I felt content with life (at first) when I was taking kratom. I started spending a lot of money on things that I didn't need. I started buying extracts and probably spent $100 a week on kratom. It didn't even phase me because I was on kratom. Now looking back at it.. That was STUPID. I've been in debt for about a year now, but I still bought a lot of kratom and a lot of stupid things that I didn't need. Things I don't even enjoy now that I'm off kratom.

Kratom made me enjoy things I wouldn't normally enjoy. Kratom made me spend money that I never would have spent had I not been on it. Kratom made me feel on top of the world, but I was avoiding people, looking pale and unhealthy, and I didn't even realize it. That was not me. The person I was during extended kratom use is nowhere near the person I really am.

Watch out for things like that. Spending, activities, habits, etc.. Is that really you? Are you making choices that you would never in a million years make because of kratom? That was the case for me as well as it is for many others I'm sure. For some people that illusion could go on for years.

People who have trouble mentally are more prone to use substances. I'm sure most of the people on here aren't crazy at all, but we all have our problems. If you have a mental illness or other addiction issues, please pay attention to your actions and behaviors. Be self-aware. See what you're doing to yourself whether it's good or bad. I think that self-awareness is important for everyone else as well.

Life goes by fast. Watch what you're doing. Know that good habits lead to more good habits. Maybe you have other vices. Tackling the kratom dependency might be the beginning of a beautiful recovery. Maybe it could be a catalyst to start eating better or going to the gym. It's different for everyone.

Addiction is an evil entity. Stress sucks. Life is hard. For the sake of your future please take care of yourselves, eat better, get more sleep, and make strides in areas of your life that align with your goals. Make some goals if you don't have them. I know I have had the hardest time setting goals and making decisions because I've felt up and down all the time from excessive kratom, caffeine, thc, and other substances (never cocaine, heroin, meth, etc). Feeling different all the time makes it hard to move forward in life because you can't predict how you're going to feel in a couple hours because you're out of kratom or coming down off of something. Addiction clouds judgement.

I believe in the power of plants. I have also seen the destruction they can do.

I want you all to be aware of what you're doing, so that you can plan for the future. It doesn't matter how old you are. I know people who have hit rock bottom at 35 who are now rich at 40. Life goes fast. Everyone's situation is different, but you can always make yours better.

So I unexpectedly dropped my total intake to around 1/2 or 1/3 of what I have been taking for 5 or 6 years, and have been experiencing withdrawals. UNBEARABLE withdrawals. I am grateful I dont experience diarrhea, constipation, insomnia (my doctor prescribed me xanax and I pretty much pass out. For the most part I sleep through the night, but I work in a coffee shop and wake up at 2:30am every day, so needless to say I am beyond wiped out by the end of the day, especially now with so much less kratom being taken, no energy, fatigue, etc) My biggest issue is PANIC attacks. Oh my are these just out of this world, and it seems like they are getting more frequent and worse.. I have signed up for counceling with a group in my town to help me get clean, and I AM motivated to get clean, I have no desire to take this stuff ever again. But for me, I get off at 11am, and sit around for 8 or 9 hours after work with nothing to do, no hobbies really except for video games and I guess tv shows. I'll be completely honest, I really have no desire to take up hobbies either, and thats not the kratom talking, or the withdrawals. I have a small select list of things I like to occupy my time with, but for the most part that involves sitting around on the couch just chilling. Part of me thinks thats why my mind builds up all this panic, another thinks that I am hurting because my body is telling me to stop taking this stuff altogether, but if I am wrong about that, cold turkey is just going to be that much worse...one minute I think I'm taking too much, the next I think I need to build back up to then start tapering back down. The only time I feel normal now is when I build back up for a few doses and then feel like garbage and then dial back again, each a half gram at a time.

Anyways, my big question is really that I'm not sure if I cut back too much too fast. I had a bad experience and thats why I cut back so suddenly, but I've been on this stuff for a long time and up to around 70g per day. I just wonder if I should try to build back UP my doses (sounds counterintuitive, I know, but my incredibly supportive wife is in control of my schedule now, and I dont deviate from it one bit) just until I can establish a baseline to start for a much more manageable and gradual taper schedule... I also am in the middle of a panic attack right now lol, no surprise there, I am experiencing them almost all of every day now. I definitely dont feel ""better"" or ""normal"" anymore when I take my next dose, which was the only reason why I was craving that next dose anymore anyways... I am really considering approaching my councelor about suboxone, he had suggested that during my assessment, and I'm just curious if it really helps. I also dont know if you can be taking kratom while you are on it, I feel like the answer is no... and I'm worried what my mind (not really my body) will do if I cut out kratom entirely to take the sub..

Not sure where to go from here, but I'm going to give my councelor a call, I know everyone on here says keep digging and keep at it, but at the point where I'm at, there is NO way I can keep going like this. Especially since it has noticeably been getting worse, and not necessarily because of our taper (we've only tapered down .6g per day once since the big drop).... by the end of the day, I am a complete and utter mess.. \*sigh\*",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7474297}"

I have 2 boys, 7 and 9 years old and an amazing husband but even still, I couldn't break this horrible habit. I felt worthless every single fucking day for 2 years straight. It was by far the darkest i had ever been in life! 

But FINALLY, I had enough and gave it one last real try. I used Covid as reason to take time off work to get through it and was honest with everyone around me. I got a great quitting kratom support system and it made all the difference in the world. The first 7 days were pretty much hell, pure hell. But i just held on because all these other people kept telling me to and that it would get better. That was literally all i had to go on, in that moment i didn't feel like it would ever end. It was horrible! By day 8 i started to really see a difference and started doing things and getting out but being easy on myself. That made a huge difference! 

Skip forward to yesterday, I was at the ball field with hubby and kids playing ball, came home and cooked dinner for them and we laughed at the dinner table like we did before kratom tore my soul out and i was just an angry bitch. I even found myself laying on hubby's shoulder while going to sleep last night, i hadn't done that in sooo long. And i felt safe and secure, another feeling kratom stole from me. Skip into today, I ran errands, went to the grocery store, and tonight we are having a family night out and guess what, I didn't die like kratom told my brain I would. I am listening to music, enjoying my kids and their laughter, washing my ass and not sweating like a wet horse afterwards, even started putting on makeup again and this morning as i looked in the mirror, my eyes looked so much more clear and open in a beautiful way! For almost 3 years i absolutely hated looking in my own eyes, hell i hated my own reflection, literally. I would legit avoid anything that made me see myself. I was a complete stranger! 

Guys it was just a mere 13 days ago that i was hopeless and never thought i could possibly quit and today i am soooo glad i did! No i am not perfect but this by far beats my best day using kratom. It CAN be done and you ARE worth it! I was legit basically a lost cause by that point and in less than 2 weeks i am smiling again and no longer have to be a slave every morning that i open my eyes. I have a very long way to go and i damn sure am not ready to run a mile but i can get up today and face the day without kratom and that my friends is what i believe we all are aiming for! Guys just dont give up on yourselves, because i promise if my ass can do it, any fucking one can!",55,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.44330424}"

My brain keeps telling me the supplements aren't doing enough and my use of caffeine, nicotine, kava, and (sometimes) phenibut has gone up since quitting. I know phenibut could be an even bigger issue than kratom so I never take it more than 3 times a week. But I don't think it's very healthy to take at all tbh.

I went 6 days without the kratom, so I felt that the worst was over. That wasn't the case. Anxiety really started to settle in, my blood sugar is messed up, and my sleep has suffered.

I have been able to fall asleep, but the amount of hours I got on days 6,7, and 8 definitely didn't suffice. With that lack of sleep along with the other withdrawal symptoms, I had some rough days where I was just anxious, pale, and very out of it.

Long time lurker, first time poster. Above all else, I’d love to hear from others about when the dull, achy, discomfort in my upper right quadrant will subside.  But first, here is my story (briefly) for context: 

First started using in Feb ‘18. Very quickly became a daily user between 30 - 40 gpd of powdered leaf. Took it first thing in the morning and spread doses throughout day and evening. Eventually, I encountered serious erectile dysfunction about 8 months in. After a trip to the doctor and some blood work, the K seemed to be the culprit. Did a CT quit on a Friday night after finding this sub, and immediately went into acutes. Acute withdrawals were extremely difficult. Severe lethargy, constant brain fog and headache, insomnia and gastric issues for about 2 weeks. Within a month, I felt back to 100%, except the ED, which took a few more months and a few scripts of the blue pill to return to normal. Fast forward 11 months and I start up again, thinking, I’ll do it right this time. Lol. This time around, I was taking about 20-30 gpd between 3:00 to 10:00 pm. About 2 weeks ago, I started to notice a feeling of fullness and dull ache in my upper right abdomen. Seemed to get worse after dosing and meals. Continued to use and ache seemed to get slightly worse. Eventually hopped back on this thread and became convinced that I had destroyed my liver.  Saw several posts from others describing the same abdomen pain and all reported that it ceased immediately after they quit. As such, I quit CT again, scared to death of the withdrawals that I knew were coming, but excited to eliminate my abdomen ache. 

Much to my surprise, my acutes this time around were relatively minor. During the first few days the biggest symptom was fatigue, but only at nighttime. Had a few headaches and some feelings of depression, but nothing like last time. I’ve been taking magnesium and 25mg of CBD at nighttime. By today, day 6, I am mostly feeling back to normal. However, this abdomen ache will not go away. After I thought it was maybe getting a little better, it came back with a vengeance today. It feels to be under my rib cage on my right side and sometimes radiates around my side and into my back.  It’s not a bad pain. Just causes discomfort when I sit and is noticeable at all other times. 

I’d love to hear from anybody that dealt with this kind of ache/pain and if/when it resolved. Thanks everyone for contributing to this community and for helping me quit!!",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4372119}"

I messed up and relapsed. It started a couple months ago. I used to be a 90 gpd user after many years of using but have capped it at 30 gpd since relapsing. I had a few weeks of sobriety and then before the relapse that led to that I had about 6 months. I’ve been with my bf for 2.5 years, and when he met me, I had just gotten put on Suboxone due to my insane kratom dependency that was leaving me dangerously suicidal every time I tried to stop. My life got more manageable on subs but I knew I wanted to get off of them because I wanted to be completely dependency free. My bf supported me in tapering off of them but I was left still dependent on them by the time we moved out of state together, so I went back in kratom to avoid withdrawals. I was a mess trying to get off if kratom again and after many failed attempts I checked myself into a detox center. After detox, I was able to get on Vivitrol and stayed completely sober for several months, up until I couldn’t get a shot anymore due to covid, and eventually caving in. I told him about the relapse and he made me stop immediately before we moved again out of state. Well we’re finally settled down where we want to be, but kratom is frikin everywhere here. So many gas stations carry it! I then started an extremely emotionally taxing and stressful job here working to support people with disabilities, and it was only a matter of time that I messed up. 
Well, he asked about it tonight and I initially lied and said no, I didn’t relapse. His grandpa died today and I didn’t want to pile on. Then I remembered how hurt and angry he was when I lied before about it, so I backtracked and said I had actually relapsed. He was extremely disappointed in me. Not angry or yelling but it hurt him. I told him I keep going back because essentially I feel too much and I want to numb these feelings. I’m a person that cares too much for their own good. I do it out if survival, in order to simply live with myself. He didn’t want to talk about it too long as he was already having a bad day.

I feel like a terrible person, doing this to him repeatedly. He is the best partner a girl could ask for, and I feel like a piece of shit deceiving him. All I’ve felt is guilt for weeks, until the kratom can numb that feeling slightly. Never completely. But damn this guilt is seriously amping up daily, especially now that I’ve told him. 

I am looking at getting the sublocade shot, and have been waiting to get in health insurance to do so. Maybe that seems extreme to some of you, but I have thought this through and it is my best option going forward. I’ve tried literally everything else and I can’t keep doing this to him.

I've been seeing doctors for months over serious heart rhythm issues, gut issues, panic attacks, and dizzyness. After 20,000 tests or so, and an endoscopy, they've narrowed it down to orthostatic hypotension (falling blood pressure when I stand or move), and serious adrenal and hormone problems -- my cortisol levels are off the charts.

I had noticed recently, when I get up in the night, sometimes my pupils are dilated to a psychedelic level. My doctor actually remarked on them being huge -- indicative of gland issues.

It would explain, to me why recovery takes so long for some people. And it makes sense, since K is both a stimulant, and hitting like all of your opioid receptors, that it would come with consequences to your natural production of critical hormones.

Hello  all, I am on day 35 of not going over half or so of what I used to  take. Things are NOT going well for me, these panic attacks are out of  this world. But most of the time, they are related to me worrying about  whether my last dose was just the right amount to not feel withdrawals,  or how much I took yesterday affecting how I feel today. I still have  waves of thinking I need my wife to take me to the hospital, almost  every day, but I get on this forum and immediately feel better. I have  clonidine that my doctor prescribed, but took it once and freaked out  and havent taken it again. Has anyone had success with clonidine to help  with WDs? I did some research to see if I can take it with the Xanax I  was also prescribed, some places say you can take them together, others  say you shouldnt take it with other things that make you drowsy... still  undecided on that..

I am just  checking in, you all have been immeasurably helpful. I still feel  extremely out of it, very loopy, hard to focus my eyes. Fortunately I  only went through the RLS for maybe 3 days, and it was very mild. I have  occasional nausea, but usually only when I worry about having nausea,  and it always goes away after about 10 min, sometimes less. Another  thing I am fortunate for is having my wife supporting me through this,  she keeps a log, and measures out all my next bags. In fact, you should  see her scale/extra measured bags setup, its nuts. So organized and  beautiful, she keeps the log in a journal and a more detail Excel  spreadsheet on the whole thing, doses, percentages of mytraginine, how I  am feeling each day, etc.

One  thing I have NOT done according to the taper guide is stick with one  strain... I feel a little guilty about this, but for some reason, I feel  like during my freak outs if I have something in my head to blame and  say ""okay next dose will be a such and such strain"", it helps my panic  attacks go away.

We are still  trying to establish a baseline, currently 3.4g doses every 2 hours and  20 minutes. Not going to lie, I CRAVE that next dose, but I'm noticing  lately that I am not craving the high at all anymore, I only crave it  for the few few moments of relief from the withdrawals. We are going to  start there and cut back .1g per dose every 5 days, depending on how I  am feeling (likely horrible lol), bringing my daily intake down by .6g  every 5 days. I realize that this means it will take a long time to get  down to zero, but who knows? Maybe we'll cut back more frequently than  that if I am up for it, and maybe I'll get to a point where I am  comfortable enough to jump. I am feeling optimistic this time around  (despite having one of my worst panic attacks yet about 2 hours ago),  and certainly this post is considerably more light hearted than my last  one. Although admittedly I was in the middle of a panic attack when I  wrote my last one.. but I can still work, in fact work keeps my mind off  of things, and keeps me off the couch, I feel way better at work than I  ever do at home. My appetite is BACK with a vengeance, and I have been  drinking orange juice and apple juice. I only eat one meal a day, a big  meal, I know its controversial and 99% of people I tell say it's  extremely unhealthy blah blah blah. Not gonna fight with anyone on this,  I believe what I believe and I've been doing it for 7 or 8 years, lost  96 pounds, AND cooking the food every night once again gets me off the  couch.

This first question is if, while tapering, does the timing of the damage matter or is it all mainly about just taking less. I realize everyone is different as to when they start to feel withdrawal but if someone wanted to take 6G split across three doses and someone was okay just doing it all at once if it would really matter? 

The second question involves if the route of administration matters. When I was tapering I stuck with capsules because that's what I always took. But towards the end of my taper would of switching to say just swallowing the powder had an effect possibly allowing me to take less compared to what I would have had to with a capsule?

Not sure if any of that made sense. I'm more curious about the second one than the first but was wondering none the less.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.6556451}"

i tried to quit CT for quite some time. It was horrible. My daily dosage varies from day to day. On some days 8 grams in the evening in 3 doses and on weekends sometimes more or less. Im realy jeallous at people who can quit CT without having WD.

I take it daily at 17 o clock, besides on weekends, where i start in the morning and keeping a straight dose throughout the day. I want to quit it with tapering. I want to go everyday 0.5 grams down from 8 grams, besides on weekends where i will try to be steady at one dosage for three days, because i know me and on weekends the craving is even higher. So, my question is, will i suffer from withdrawal? I will take my time, because i dont want to feel like shit. Im currently sitting in homeoffice so you can imagine, that this is a hard time, cause the drug is always behind the corner :D 

My question is, is it better at my working days to take small doses throught the day or as usual one dosage in the evening? I dont wont do be ""high"" when working, you know, but everybody says, it is better when tappering off. What are your experiences and at what dosage you can quit from tappering to CT withouth having any negative side effects?

I took anywhere between 30 to 60 g a day. When I got there they didn't really know what opiate I was trying to get off of but then when I met with the doctor she prescribed me a four-day concoction of Klonopin promethazine and clonidine. Then she told me on the fourth day to start taking naltrexone. Obviously those four days I was told not to take any kratom at all. Well I haven't drank anything more than a beer in over a year and a half and the first Klonopin that I took I went into a blackout and got hammered drunk for about two days, then I woke up and it was a week later I miss work all week and I said screw this I'm going to just take kratom. My life was easier dealing with those headaches and arm pains and whatever else I would get from taking too much kratom all the time. However yesterday I ran out of kratom and my wife left my license at my mom's house about 45 minutes away because my wallet was in her bag so I can't buy any today. For some reason though I don't seem to have any withdrawal symptoms. So I guess that's it for me, I do not wish a week-long blackout on you because I know that by the sheer grace of God himself I wasn't arrested when police found me passed out behind the liquor store, and I didn't crash my car despite not having drank in about a year. Hopefully I can just push past random cravings that I know will come because it would be really nice to not be dependent on kratom anymore.",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4698686}"

My use mainly stayed around 10gpd, three doses a day, one in the morning, afternoon, and evening. I’ve definitely taken 15 or 20 grams in a day before, usually because of life situations, extra stress, but that was never a daily thing. I’ve always hovered at 10gpd, telling myself I’m being responsible with that.

The honeymoon phase was great, I started taking it everyday from the beginning. Each dose just hit so good, my work days would fly by in a blink. I would say the honeymoon lasted about 6 to 7 months. After the honeymoon phase I was still getting decent effects but tolerance was definitely setting in. The first year of daily use was alright, going into the 2nd year that’s when I started to experience more negative side effects.

For starters the irratation and mood swings slowly became more and more of a problem, until it was full blown opioid rage at the end and it was very bad. I would wake up restless and feeling like shit every morning. Constipation slowly got worse, which it wasn’t even a problem the first year. 

These past couple of months it hasn’t been fun at all. I started having really terrible gut issues and full blown daily inner rage, I knew I had to get out. I have stubbornly hung on for the longest time, I think it’s a piece of my mind still clinging on to what the honeymoon phase once was. I would repeatedly sabotage so many tapers and it’s like good fucking grief will I ever get off this shit?

Each time I tried to go back the side effects would just get worse. I had myself stabilized on one dose once again every 24 hours and was tapering off. This time feels different because I developed a strong hate for this shit and what it did to me. I was planning to jump at 2gpd but I last took 4g of kratom on 1/21 and decided fuck this were going to go ahead and jump off. I watched that warmth take over and it felt so wrong, that feeling is a fucking lie and I just needed to get myself away from it. On the 3rd day I tossed my stash which was probably around 800grams, drove to a gas station and threw it all out at one of those trash cans next to the pumps. I wasn’t going to be comfortable if I threw it out at my place, it would still be to close for me to go dig it all back out.

So I’m here on day 4 now, I haven’t been off it this long in two years. Each day seems to have its on challenges. The first two days I was in and out of this super edge/in pending doom type of feeling. I was having the chills and my body felt achy, kinda sore. Super lethargic, no energy for anything. There was a lot of this going on too when I was tapering my last dose, over the course of about two weeks. 

My withdrawals seem to be in waves and its weird. One moment I’m fine and the other I’m not. I do notice with each day there becoming more spaced apart. I was feeling super edgy in the shower this morning before work, but I feel ok as I type this right now.

I know I’m in a recovery mode and I’m taking this day by day, don’t want to get ahead of myself.  With a more clear head now I can so how bad it really was, and it’s pretty terrifying actually. I almost feel traumatized that I kept myself in that space for so long. Man... I am 25 years old and this has been the most difficult thing I have ever dealt with in my entire.

Honestly it has helped so much and I thought reading all these stories would make it harder for me to quit cause of the constant reminder of K but it’s done the complete opposite! 

I come from a 10 year opiate addiction that started with me hurting my back from rock climbing. I was young and sadly the doctor gave me the devil in pill form that slowly took over my life and took his place in the driver seat. I can say the first couple years were a “blast” having all the heightened feelings, infinite energy, insane social connections etc. Eventually all of that faded away and I was lost in a downward spiral that I was to afraid to confront. As the years passed I can say I eventually did kick the pills and was sober in life (I’ve never done much more than opiates and K). Then that all changed when I moved across the country and lost my son to the corrupted California court system. 

  Fast forward to a friend introducing me to K for my back pain (it’s always aching and I knew I didn’t want the devil back in me) so he said it’s legal and really good for you, it’s a “plant” he said. Stupid of me not to research it and the addictiveness it causes. So I started taking it and oh boy! Little did I know the devil was back in the driver seat for 3 years until now!!! 

   Today is my day 5 from tapering down to about 5gpd. I have been doing 5gpd for about 3 months now and I constantly felt I was in withdrawal so I decided to just jump. I know I’m all over the place here typing (blame the devil) but I just wanna say to all of you out there that “THE NORMAL YOU” that your looking for does come back! It might take a week, month or even a few months but YOU do come back.  I know this because I was watching a movie with my wife today and during a funny scene I just started laughing out loud so hard and I look over and my wife is in tears uncontrollably. I asked what happened? Did I do something? She simply said “I haven’t heard you laugh like that in years” At that moment I knew she was getting her husband back that she deserves!

I was pretty naive when I realized I wanted to quit. I thought, well I’ll taper, and then maybe I can take it occasionally. But months passed and I was never able to go a single day without Kratom. After doing more research and finding this sub, I realized, oh this is going to be a process. It took about 4 months from that moment to find the strength and to psychologically prepare. I tapered - bought the scale, measured doses and jumped right after Christmas since I knew I’d have no obligations for a few weeks. Because I tapered the acutes were not too bad. Of course I was hit by the low energy, fatigue and mood swings pretty bad. I snapped at people more then I wish I had. I had the pink cloud for one short day around day 18 and PAWS Days 19/20 and again on Day 29. I was also pretty emotional and cried a bit the first 2 weeks - like going through some kind of reawakening. Anyway I’d like to focus on the best part of quitting — the magic moments that happen, like finding yourself connecting with another person in the middle of a conversation and suddenly realizing “I am able to do life without Kratom.” Or really the best part is when you do something enjoyable - like watching a movie or yesterday I saw snow for the first time in idyllwild - short day trip for a day. I was experiencing the awe and beauty of nature naturally and it was incredible. So yeah there are many tough moments during quitting Kratom, but then there’s the magic of true connection and real joy and it’s so worth it. The way I see it - I’ve made it 30 days and I didn’t really put any pressure on myself other then just making it 30 days. Next 30 days, I’m giving myself a new challenge- to start recreating my life. Now I can identify the things I definitely don’t like about my life cause I no longer have Kratom to cloud how I feel about things, so it’s time to start making positive changes.

NOT dear kratom,

&#x200B;

When I met you right around the turn of the century, I thought you were going to be a great addition to my life. I googled you; my search terms were “euphoria and herbs” and you and kava kava showed up on top of the list. After I tried you, it seemed too good to be true. Despite how bloody nasty you tasted, there was a good side to you; some euphoria. The best part of it all was that you were legal; I didn’t have to sneak around. Well except for the part where I would have to live a double life hiding our little secret. Actually it started out little until I found myself calling on you several times during the day. As the grams went up, my life went down. You had to go. So I set a date, and cold turkied your ass. Wasn’t a big deal. 

	Some time later, I had some issues in life and thought that I could call on you for a quickie. Oh you were all to glad to see me. After I took the first dose, I immediately sensed that there was going to be a price to pay. You are like a bad contract that has hidden terms that really don’t even exist. It took me relapsing over 8 times to fully understand the price that must be paid. It’s not optional. Unlike other drugs that I’ve done and been addicted to, you are the only one that has never gone away from my mind; whether I’m using you or I’m clean and keep hearing your demon ass whispering in my ear to start up again. You are a lot like the mafia; there will be pain when someone leaves you, be it physical and mental. The other price that is paid, is lost relationships because I become more introverted when I’m using you. Families and friends are not exempt from the pain. You have stripped me of the passion that I once had in live, but have kept me just functional enough to hold down a job and pay the bills. There doesn’t seem to be a bottom, which as an addict is almost necessary for me to pry myself from your addictive claws. I usually just  say, “well … not today.” I’ve been saying that for 3 years. I’ve lost 30 pounds of muscle in those 3 years as well as plenty of hair. 

	So,this isn’t exactly a goodbye letter as I’m still your slave. But do know that this letter will be finished very soon. I will be armed, armed with the God of my understanding and the fellowship… the fellowship of loving people right here in this meeting.

I actually haven't felt any pleasurable effects in years minus a handful of times. This plant has stolen my life and my health. I am 28 years old and my energy levels feel like a 70 year old. My hair, focus, energy, sex drive, skin, weight ect is all fucked. I'm always numb, I miss FEELING. My eyesight has also gotten bad but I don't know if its the kratom or not. Do any of you experience blurry eyesight, like you can't focus in? Is this a kratom effect? 

   Anyways, I have tried to CT like 30 times in the last 3 years and outside of 2 times I always cave because the electric goosebumps skin feeling and anhedonia get to be too intense, even with clonidine. I have some clonidine and like 6 gabapentin 300's. I have read that these are safe to take during pregnancy. I cant get in with the doctor for 3 more weeks so I wanted to ask for some opinions/advice on here. 

  Does anyone know if going CT could cause miscarriage? If that is possible or common? And with the amount per day that I take, what would be a good taper plan if its too risky to CT? Advice for the hot/cold sweats and crawly skin? 

   ANY taper/CT/WD or just plain motivation advice would be so appreciated. I am not going to let this wretched plant steal any more of my days than I have to. I want this so badly but when the WD sets in it get so hard, and so easy to say, ""Okay I will take it today but I will definitely quit tomorrow."" I have 2 kids (3yo & 5yo) so I don't have the option of laying in bed or not having responsibilities for multiple days. 

Please someone help me, I am literally sobbing in despair right now because I feel such a lack of direction in escaping this addiction.",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7583892}"

I used kratom daily for almost two years (10-15 GPD) and after some days of tampering I stopped it around 100 days ago. Since then I used once like two months ago (it didn't make any sense, just gave me a good night sleep to wake up again at 0 CT). 

After quitting I struggled sleeping for a bit more than a week. My average was around 2-3 hrs/night, but then it started to get better slowly. The thing is that during the last weeks it became worse again. I had no problem with falling asleep, I don't have RLS, but I wake up 6-8 times a night which can be some minutes, half an hour, sometimes more than an hour. Usually gave up sleeping after 6 hours of this struggling. 

The other stuff that remained is sneezing and flu-like symptoms. Usually I'm having them for a day or two and then it dissapears the other day. And then it starts again.

I take vitamin C, D, Mg and mulungu tea, l-tryptophane, GABA (these two are not the best in crossing the BBB, but mulungu tea gives some sedation). 

I don't really want to take sleeping pills, but it's getting unhealthy and unsecure living like this. I started to take more caffeine during the day to survive, but I'm just creaing a vicious circle with that.

Any suggestions or similar symptoms?

2021-01-24 21:35:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/l4dyjk/dont_give_up/,don’t give up,"apologies for the long post. this sub helped me when i was quitting and i’m hoping my retrospective/story can help others...

500 days ago i had become so fed up with my addiction that i decided to do something about it. tomorrow is 500 days kratom-free for me. 

some background: i was using 2-3 liquid extracts/day, which was basically a $50/day habit, for 3+ years. i made enough money to “afford” this, but it was absolutely insane that i had spent years burning tens of thousands of dollars. add all the juul pods i bought to complement my high, and the numbers get even worse. the little things add up, for real. 

in retrospect, all of this ultimately amounted to a mediocre high, erectile issues, mood swings, constant sweating/overheating, massive increase in anxiety, and so many other things. worst of all, to ensure i got the maximum effect from my doses, i would pretty much only eat one meal per day, usually very late at night. i was physically weak and completely out of shape (more on this later), and always planning my next dose or two. 

now to be fair to kratom, this hasn’t been my only struggle with substances. i spent over a decade abusing opiates before i learned about kratom. lots of oxy and hydrocodone, some brief periods of heroin use, and other random pharmaceuticals i could get my my hands on, like dilaudid. the difference for me is the opiates typically weren’t daily habits, minus a few bouts with oxy over the years. kratom flipped the same switch in my brain that these opiates had been doing for years. the problem with kratom (to me, at least) is that it’s so available and it doesn’t fuck you up so much that you can’t take it before/during work, a family function, a date, etc. it becomes a habit that you can easily hide for a very long time, which is very unlike real opiates IMO. but eventually, the habit starts to catch up to you. 

for me, there were several occasions where my kratom usage directly impacted my day-to-day. get lucky on a tinder date and bring a girl home? good fucking luck getting and keeping your dick hard with that condom on. superior at work gets something wrong and you think it reflects poorly on you? don’t lose your shit trying to correct said superior on their honest mistake. back in your hometown visiting your parents for a weekend? have fun sneaking around their house to take your “drugs” and not feel guilty as fuck about it. 

my worst day of all and i’ll never forget it: it was an extremely hot and humid saturday in the summer. i hadn’t eaten anything in 18 or so hours but i was full of kratom and had just walked a mile. i was eating a burger alone in a small restaurant and i was having trouble because my hands and arms would not stop shaking. i went to refill my drink and my legs almost gave out. i could barely walk out of the restaurant without literally falling over. i had to sit on the fucking ground outside and call an uber to get back to my apartment, which was only 5 blocks away. i had never in my life experienced something like this. what in the fuck? how did i do this to myself? 

i realize there are wayyyy worse stories of drug addiction that ruins lives and families and relationships. i don’t think my story is one of those, though it’d be hard to defend that for one relationship of mine in particular. the big boy drugs like heroin and meth certainly seem more destructive in the short/medium term, but maybe that’s my point with all this text — kratom is a slower problem that can lead to big personal issues. outside of the financial aspect, i didn’t truly recognize what it was doing to me for years. 

quitting kratom cold turkey was easier than i thought for the first 4 or so days. but the two weeks after that were pretty tough. restless legs led to only a few hours of sleep per night. i was exhausted trying to do my job and drinking coffee made my anxiety shoot through the roof, but eventually it got better. short term pain is doable when you’re able to recognize exactly why it’s there, and the whole experience will make you stronger in the long run. 

you can do it. it’ll only take a couple weeks for the majority of people. know that it will be uncomfortable, but also know that you’ll come out on the other end much stronger and much happier.  good luck, i am rooting for you.",20,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6981136}"

Finally I have my drive and motivation that I had before during my honeymoon period with Kratom, except I dont have to take kratom!

Overall its been a rough ass ride, I also quit nicotine in the last 3 months, and alcohol before that, though I occasionally drink now.

I started spending the money I saved on kratom and alcohol and nicotine on supplements, better diet, and some other self-care type things that I wanted. Started meditation every day a few years ago, but sticking with that has been immensely helpful in getting me back on my feet. Also, working out a bit here and there, also I have a physical job so that helps keep me active.

Not sure what else to say, other than just keep going if you're in the thick of it... It probably wont take you nearly 200 days to feel as great as I do, I had a super long history with harder opiates, and other drugs, before ever getting into kratom

Oh, and because I know someone will ask, my peak kratom use was around 15 to 20 grams a day, not super high, but again for over a decade I was tickling my opioid receptors. I tapered down to a ridiculously low amount, like 1.2gpd, then half that for a few days then jumped.

Some might find it easier to CT off it, but I only had the luxury of a 5 day weekend to get entirely off of it, so tapering through most of it was my only option. Work was absolutely miserable for the first few days, but also the pink cloud period is beautiful. Since then ups and downs, and by 185-190 days I was feeling amazing, best I have in years. Now is probably like day 195 or something, but I actually stopped counting. I can always go back and check my journal notes to see how many days if im curious in the future. Thats another thing, document your struggles and progress! Take notes! And also, looking back I had some great days even after 2 weeks, and 30 days, its just accumulative and now I can genuinely say I am better than before I even started on it. Dont expect it to take 200 days to feel better!

You might have not had a good nights sleep because you’re still WDing. You also might’ve went to bed freaking out about not getting a good nights sleep so much that you didn’t get a good nights sleep.

Your back, knees, or legs might’ve hurt because you’re still WDing. You also might just have some back or knee pain, like maybe 950 million other people today who have never even heard of Kratom.

You might be feeling sad, lethargic, or unmotivated because you’re still WDing. Or you might just be having a bad day. Remember those? You had a lot of those before you ever took kratom.

You ever tell yourself something hurts, when it didn’t, and then it starts hurting. Do you ever watch a video of a guy breaking his leg and all of a sudden you get some pain in your knees?
Get where I’m going with this?

All I’m saying is don’t freak out about every little symptom you MIGHT have. Again, If you Google “I have a migraine”, google will tell you you have brain cancer lol. 

And for the people who are past day 120, I know it comes from a good place, but the last thing you should do is tell somebody on day 3 that they’re about to go through three months of hell and “PAWS” and all that other shit. I know you want them to know what to expect, I know your intentions are good, but you’re freaking people the fuck out lol. Not something you tell somebody the first week. Especially not something you tell somebody who hasn’t even quit yet. Because before I quit I would see people talking about they want to jump off a bridge after 795 days ct I’m likeee, ummm it’s been like 3 years you might have some other issues going on my guy... lol

Some people had a really bad experience and took them 90 days to feel better. Some people felt absolutely 100% fine after 15 days. Everyone’s experience will be different including yours. 

Read, get informed, that’s fine. Don’t freak out about other people’s shitty experiences. Worst thing you can possibly do on my opinion. I’m on day 18 and what’s kept me feeling, for the most part, pretty normal and pretty happy, is not overthinking. Really not even thinking about WDs in general until something reminds me of the last 18 days. Just going along my day like I used to do without taking a dose every 2.5 hours. It is possible. You can program your brain. Just takes some willpower.

My girl didn’t even know I was WDing. I managed to get away with being “sick” for like three nights. After that I had to work and go about my life like I was 100% fine. Now that was TOUGH, but it made me realize that I’m not a bitch and can get through anything. 

One day she was like “Babeeeeee (in that annoying way girls say it lmao) let’s go for a long walk!”. In my head I was like “Yeah go F yourself” lol. But I did it.

As with so many others, this forum has been an invaluable resource throughout my quit.  Really cannot sufficiently convey my gratitude to the mods and long-term quitters who stick around to see each new crop of neophytes through this agonizing journey.  You are doing God's work.  And it's commendable. So consider yourselves commended.

Stats: 3 years, 40-50 gpd.  45 y/o man.  Pretty good health.  No complementary addictions (apart from nicotine and caffeine).  Cold turkey with no taper.

When first jumping, I consoled myself with the assurance that I'd be different.  No chance in hell I would be like these other weaklings and woe-begotten sad-sacks...no way this would last several weeks or months for me, as I was different.  Bracing myself for a week of agony and then a week of malaise, I made the dive anxious to regain my 'self' -- my perspicacity, my drive, my zeal for living, my creativity, my libido, my personality...my soul.  It is my firm conviction that this shit somehow suffocates your very soul through its twisted alchemy on our endocrines.  

The first week was indeed hellish.  I didn't experience much in the way of RLS, nor did I have terrible GI issues and the body pains, though significant, were tolerable.  For me the most pronounced and unbearable aspects of the first week were the freakish lethargy (felt like a 90 y/o chemo patient), the depersonalization (everything felt alien and malignant), off-the-charts anxiety and absolute anhedonia, to the extent I couldn't even watch television or follow the news, and some insomnia.

The second week a lot of the physical stuff started to subside and the emotional/psychological/hormonal issues asserted themselves.  I didn't get much of a pink cloud, but whatever I had was between days 8 and 12.  I was able to listen to music a little and, as with many others, the experience was near sublime.  Those early tinglings of music's enlivening rapture were among the first indications that my soul was indeed reawakening.  This had me excited.  Feeling these emergent emotions, sensations I feared were gone for good, had me further convinced that normalcy was just a day or two away.  

laughing out loud.  Looking back, I'm amused at my naivete in the early going.  I kept telling myself, and my wife, that 'another day or two and I should be fine'.   Quitting is very much like chasing a rainbow's end.  You can see a specific point where the rainbow's arch intersects with land off in the distance; making your way there you find that the rainbow's end has jumped off about the same distance from where you started.  For me these points were the stories of others -- those lucky few who were right as rain in ten, twelve or fifteen days.  And so, with each additional lucky-quitter story, the end of my rainbow was pegged at their own turning point -- but this protean thing kept flitting away as soon as I approached.  My turning point was, unfortunately, much further afield.  

Once the pink cloud lifted, the anhedonia, lethargy, listlessness and severe anxiety settled in to stay.  It's hard to chart your progress, but you're definitely aware that you're making progress.  But progress itself is a dispiriting and often depressing experience.  You feel a bit better one day and you expect the next day to follow suit; very often the next day is worse, and you're so exasperated with it all, inviting feelings of hopelessness and despair.  You go through periods where you wonder whether or not you'll feel normal again.  

Another advantage of my quit was the complete and total lack of cravings.  I became so disgusted with myself and that green goblin after three miserable years I never wanted to see it again.  The revulsion remains -- I have nothing but contempt for the shit (and my former self on it), and crave only beer occasionally.  I bring this up to stress a very important point -- do not cheat this process.  You will pay for it.  Twice I decided to give myself a breather from the anxiety and had a couple of beers.  Not only did it fail to yield any relief, I'm certain each tiny cheat cost me days of recovery.  Caffeine too...at least for me...was a caustic and debilitating substance.  You really do have to embrace the suck, or you will get sucked back into the void.  Read the relapse stories.  Avoid the pitfalls.

Speaking of benefits, the duration of this agony is itself a benefit in terms of its net effect.  In the first couple of weeks, I couldn't wait to once again enjoy beer the way I once did.  That effervescent sensation of calm and warmth and strength that beer always imbued was sorely missed.  But as the days peel away, you have some time to think over your past behaviors.  I started to really see how destructive and wasteful were my beer-drinking days.  Not to say I'll never drink socially again, but the 'six-pack for the hell of it' era is over for me.  I further started to see the role coffee played in this cycle.  I would spend all day drinking coffee to get me through; coffee would make me edgy; end of day comes and I want something to take the edge off.  Beer, kratom, other shit...and it's a cycle that's been on repeat for many years.  This quit brought it all into clear view.

While we're on the subject of positives, I'd like to emphasize a few that emerged in the early going.  Physically, it was as if my health and vitality were a coiled spring waiting for release.  My physical health started to explode back the second week.  Granted, I still felt weak because of the hormonal fuckery, but the physical indications of rejuvenation were impossible to dismiss.  My fingernails were growing at an incredible clip -- I had to trim them each and every day the second and third week.  My skin...wow...what a difference.  My glow returned along with the ruddiness and smooth texture.  The darkening in my face diminished quickly.  The whites in my eyes were so bright again.  My hair grew fuller, more lustrous and the sheen returned (I never experienced hairloss with kratom use, though).  The restoration of sharp, crisp vision was near miraculous...thought I was going to have to concede to glasses near the end of my kratom run.  Also colors were again magnificent and light itself seemed to possess near magical qualities.  

The libido issue was funny.  Near the end of the first week it was like an animal had been released from a cage.  Truly insane.  And then, about half way through the second week, it was as if my body suddenly and precipitously down-regulated libido.  I quite literally felt it happen in an instant.  Fortunately, normalcy in that respect is slowly returning.  

Weeks three through six were a straight-up funk.  On the one hand I'm very blessed with a break from work to see this through; on the other, I wonder whether or not these last few weeks would've been better spent keeping myself occupied.  Hard to say, really.  But insofar as I work with people for a living, there's a strong possibility relapse would've resulted had work been requisite.  It's very hard to describe to others, but doing near anything was almost impossible.  When charting out the details involved in any errand or task, a sense of doom and dread would accumulate as I would think through all that was necessary to accomplish a given thing.  It had me paralyzed.   Also I could not concentrate for more than ten minutes or so.  This has improved each day, and now I'm near able to hold my attention on something for about an hour.  Still a far cry from my former self, but a big improvement.

In weeks three through six progress is slow, and whatever progress I experienced was largely obscured by the lingering anxiety, cruddiness and anhedonia.  But each day you start to notice little things you lost coming back.  You'll catch yourself laughing and think, 'what the hell was that?  I haven't authentically laughed in years'.  You'll find yourself wanting to reconnect with humanity.  You can actually develop ideas -- and this was one of the most troubling aspects of kratom addiction for me.  During my use, I would have little glints of inspiration, and instead of fleshing out the thought my mind would just shut down and these weird invasive thoughts would crowd in and quash the brief glint of inspiration.  

Beyond timelines, the main obsessions of this forum seem to be supplements, nutrition and exercise.  I took a lot of stuff in the beginning.  Most everything recommended here was by me tried -- except BSO and some other obscure items.  I can't say for sure, but I don't think any of them helped very much, with two notable exceptions.  I could always notice an improvement (though often subtle) from mega doses of vitamin C and spirulina.  In fact, spirulina has taken the place of coffee in my daily routine.  Nutrition is another matter altogether.  I feel very strongly that my diet was of immense benefit.  My body seemed to be really craving calcium, fats and protein.  I answered the call with about ten raw eggs a day (I have chickens) and about a quart (or more) of raw, unpasturized milk each and every day.  At about day four I was craving meat like a madman.  So to complement the eggs and milk I started eating lots and lots of red meat.  This and strenuous exercise were the only things that could dampen my anxiety. 

Of all the things you can do for yourself, I join the others in recommending exercise...and lots of it.  It's the very last thing you'll feel like doing, but the benefits are immediate and undeniable.  I do, however, think you can overdo it.  At one point I had about a 20 day stretch of pushing myself without a break.  I think (but I may be wrong) that overdoing exercize for a prolonged period releases too many stress hormones into your already stress-hormone-saturated body.  I never went to the gym (no interest in being around others during this experience), but there's no way someone could get more out of two dumbells and push-ups than I have over these several weeks.  Also I'm able to run a sub 8 minute mile again for the first time since leaving the military.  

To conclude, I do feel I've reached that elusive and significant turning point.  I was so disappointed when magic day 35 turned out to be just like days 15 to 34, each day marginally better or worse than the day before.  I started getting REALLY frustrated when the end of the sixth week came and I'm still bound up in knots of anxiety and mirthless despondency.  And by the end of day 44, I was talking myself into another 'breather'.  I'm torn about telling this part of the story, as I don't want to give bad advice -- but I think it's best to share anyway.  On the evening of the 44th day, I took a half of a 10 mg valium just to alleviate the anxiety for a few precious hours of calm.  I experienced no buzz at all, but it did almost totally neutralize the anxiety.  Feeling certain I would pay for this cheat with some severe bounce back anxiety, I went to bed and actually slept a full 8 hours for the first time in a LONG time. 

Waking the next day I braced myself for the onset of anxiety's crush.  An hour goes by and it's still not there.  Another hour...it's noticeable,  but more a background thing than a dominate factor.  The thought of doing things didn't consume my being with foreboding and dread and doom.   My hands weren't sweating.  My heart rate slowed noticeably.  No palpitations.  It's been three days now and it's almost as if that chip of a valium let my brain chemistry reset...hard to say for sure, but there's no way I'm still feeling the effects of that.  Who knows?  Maybe it would've happened of its own accord.  All I know is I'm grateful as I can be.

I feel about 75 to 80% better right now.  Definitely not all the way out of the woods, but I'm at least at a place where I can competently function and not feel like the world's coming to an end if I have to run an errand.  

This has been a very long first post.  I wanted it to be that way, in that one of the only things that could hold my attention at the beginning were kratom quitting stories -- the longer the better.  If you're debating whether or not to jump, allow me to push you.  It is incredibly difficult, but so-so worth it.  Kratom is malevolent.  It does seem to have almost a sinister sentience.  It's this slow and subtle process wherein everything you value about your life and your self are subsumed by this creeping menace, until all you have left is a 20 minute dud of a buzz.  

Don't relapse.

Grit your teeth.

Push through.

Fast forward I’m all good but have been using kratom the past almost two years. Usually around 20 gpd and 50-60 on the weekends. A couple weeks ago I had a long binge of 50+ gpd along with extracts twice a day. The past week I started a taper. Going from 20 gpd then down to 10. The last day 7 then jumped off. It’s now been 48 hrs sense I’ve taken any. I was honestly pretty sick during my taper,zero sleep,stomach and intestinal problems. Now I’m 48 hours with nothin I feel ok. I have mild stomach problems and rls. I managed to sleep last night with the help of a ton of kava and hydroxazine. I’m curious if this will be worse tomorrow or if I made it over a hump.

All for a few hours of subpar relaxation. Never touch kratom once you quit it. It doesn't go back to being something casual once your body learns to feel withdrawals from it. Weed and maybe a drink or two is a better way to get through an evening where being sober just isn't feeling good. Also for the record I used to take about 10gpd of kratom, but the other day I only took 1.5 grams and still am having withdrawals. Okay that's all I wanted to report.

I’m creating a taper regimen for Kratom extract tablets, of which I take 6-8/day, so often more than one $36 container. My question is, what is the best way to taper this extract stuff? It doesn’t behave like the powder. 

Options I’ve come up with so far: 
a)taper exclusively with the tablets,
b) try to switch back to powder and taper only with powder but no idea of a comparable dose, or
c) taper with the tablets and once my tolerance has lowered, switch to powder if needed.

One nice effect to the tablets is I don’t get physical withdrawals as quickly as the powder. I don’t wake up in the middle of the night sweating and sick and needing to dose, which really makes me wonder - what the heck am
I actually ingesting? I understand there’s no guarantee of what is actually in these tablets, but the container claims to contain 45mg Mittagynine, 0.015 7-Hydroxymiytragynins, and 600mg total alkaloids of Maeng Da (whatever the frack that means). 

For now, considering option C as best. Regular Kratom doesn’t have much if any noticeable effect, and I’m pretty certain I would need to take a lot of powder to avoid harsher physical and mental illness (not that I believe I’ll be getting away scot-free no matter the detox plan). I also hope that by using the tablets, maybe I’m ingesting a lesser amount of alkaloid content in typical powder that the body protests during detox? 

Thoughts? I’m also just going to experiment with decreasing the dose, at first. I know I’ll be facing increased depression, anxiety, flu-like symptoms, etc. A helpful individual messaged to relay a way to combat the restless ache/pain from opioid withdrawal. I had never thought to use compression socks or wrap up in ace bandages! How have I not heard or read that tip?! That insane restlessness is often one of my most difficult and lasting symptoms. Besides emotional misery.

It's been a weird journey this time around. But anyways, addiction is a horrible thing. Every addicted person experiences addiction differently. It's great to be able to come onto this thread and find some people who are going through some of the same symptoms. It's great not to be alone. A lot of people don't understand kratom addiction. Most people would say ""what's kratom?"" Others might say ""it didn't give me withdrawal."" We all have our own subjective experience.

Everyone who is dealing with some of the major symptoms like RLS, movement problems, panic attacks, or anhedonia, I feel your pain. We just have to remember that this is very temporary, and there will be light on the other side. It's very unfortunate to see some people struggling 50+ days into their quit, while others feel a lot better by day 5. Hell, I didn't get really bad until about day 6. It shocked me to the point that I was worried about my mental health. I've come to realization that it was the kratom withdrawal because I've been doing better these past 2 days.

Don't let the other side of the withdrawal trick your brain into doing it ""just once."" We should all know by now that following through with that action can be a very bad idea. Kratom is a tricky substance, as it messes with peoples' mind and body to the extreme.

Sore constantly and a nagging ankle foot injury has been getting worse. This is all self inflicted of course and in pursuit of a 90 day transformation contest I’m in which coincidentally ends right before my 40th birthday at the end of April. 

I talked thoroughly through this transformation journey with my therapist before signing up, letting her know my reservations about the demands it will put on me physically and mentally (dieting) and to be aware of my thought/behavior changes that could trigger relapse. I’m not at that point or anywhere near it but selling it out here so I know that I’m aware and to remain vigilant. 

I feel every activity or decision we partake in as recovering addicts has to have at least some consideration towards how it will impact our recovery and we need to choose accordingly. The best part of this is WE get to choose - nobody else.

I think it really helps that I’m getting a workout in almost every day. I rotate every 3 days: HIIT ride, weights, and recovery ride. I’m also eating much better. Modafinil kills my appetite.

My first year of use was very responsible. I would take a 6g dose once a week. My second year was not so responsible. I somehow managed to increase my usage from 6 grams once a week to 15 gram doses 4-5x a day, so like 60g to sometimes 80g in one day. I would continue maintain this habbit till it stopped working for me. which took about a month.

I got to the point where taking a 20g dose just made me feel normal. It didn't help with anything anymore, except keeping withdrawals away. So With all the problems that come with daily kratom usage I decided to taper.  

So this brings me to my third year which I'm in now. This year has been all about tapering. I started to lower the amount and frequency of usage all at once. Instead of taking 5 doses in a day I would take 4. Instead of taking 15 gram doses I would take 12. So this is what I've been doing the past 2-3 months. Now, I've finally............. gotten down to 5g per day. I use that 5g to fall asleep, as that is the one thing I can't afford to lose if I want to keep my job. I've been at 5gpd for almost 2 weeks. And It's not getting any easier. So my question is for anybody who uses 5g ONCE per day do you experience any withdrawals the rest of the day. Will my body eventually adjust to 5g once per day. I almost don't want to take the dose because I'm still getting all the classic withdrawal symptoms right when I wake up  chills, sweats, hot  flashes, goosebumps, headache, fatigue, depression, anxiety, brainfog,  lethargy, and probably more. I know the withdrawals I'm feeling aren't from 5g, but rather from the 80g taper. But how long will it take my body to adjust to 5gpd. Does anyone have experience with these dosage ranges, and tapering levels.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5378804}"

There have been very few periods of short amounts of time where I have truly been sober.  I have been having to try to rediscover who I am as a sober person.  These substances had controlled my life for far too long.  I feel like I am getting a small piece of myself back each and every day that I remain clean.  I am going to keep going until I finally get that last piece of myself and I am never going back.   I have finally accepted that I cannot do any of these substances even one more time.  My addiction is something that I will have to struggle with for the rest of my life, but I refuse to let it control me.  

It has been overwhelming to have all of my emotions flooding back it, but I have been enjoying the euphoria of laughing, feeling love again, and being excited about the future.  Even during the moments of guilt, sadness, pain, or anxiety, I have been accepted these feelings and I tell myself that anything I feel is better than feeling nothing at all.  Kratom had caused me to be a shell of my former self and it feels absolutely amazing to liberate myself from it.

I still have a couple of lingering symptoms, but it is extremely manageable.  Just more of a minor nuisance than anything serious.

I came across kratom after a recent injury and tried using it for the pain. I've had many injuries and surgeries, and I'm not even 30 yet. I've recently had several surgeries back-to-back. I used kratom for maybe a month and stopped for a few weeks without many issues. 

Ended up needing another surgery just over 2 months ago, which was extraordinarily painful. I've been using kratom daily for about 2 months (around 20 grams a day). I quit taking it about a week ago and I've felt like I've had the flu ever since. The worst part, for me, is brutal muscle cramps, aches, and weird nerve pains in my back and neck like you'd get with a flu/fever. Insomnia, fatigue, nausea and shakes also persist.  Figured I'd have withdrawals from quitting, but I didn't think they'd plague me for this long (day 7) after just two months of daily use. Clearly, I was wrong.

I’d like to say it’s been easy, but it hasn’t been.  Acutes lasted longer than they had on my previous quits.  Stomach issues persisted into week 6.  I’m out of the woods physically, but staying clean is an every day fight.  Some days are harder than others of course.  I drove to the gas station to relapse once about a month ago, but before I got out of my car I had played the tape forward...  I knew I would eventually have to face withdrawals again, and I knew outside maybe an hour or two, I’d be miserable on the relapse.  

Having a sponsor who is taking me through the twelve steps is helping me a lot.  I’m having trouble controlling my anger, and that is causing a lot of problems for me.

I just hit 8 full days about a half an hour ago. Day 9 begins now. I'm probably only going to count the hours until tomorrow (10 day mark). After that, I will just count the days. I'm glad that the worst part of this is over.

I know that all of you have heard this before, but it gets better. I had a really hard time because my first 3 days of abstinence went great, and days 4,5,6 were absolutely awful. Yesterday halfway through work I just started feeling very good, and I have felt that way for over 24 hours now. I was just very confused about my delayed withdrawal. I thought I was jail free for a short amount of time. But it gets better! If I look at how I feel right now off of kratom, and compare it to being on kratom in the same environment, now is 100% better. 

Kratom was amazing for a while, but eventually my body told me enough is enough, and then my brain followed. 

3 months ago, I was 6'1 and weighed 203 lbs. Right now I weigh 168 pounds. I know that those numbers may seem healthy, but I didn't exercise even once (I don't know why, but kratom destroys my will to work out). I've been pale with baggy eyes. Oh and the bacne..

Please keep on digging everybody. I wish you all tremendous success. DAY 9!!! I'm going to post each morning to keep updated and in check. This way I can point out some patterns, or figure out when the PAWS hits me. I don't plan on using kratom again. It's a stretch for most people here to say that they will never touch it again.

I'll be honest. When I don't take kratom or go without it and then take it, I feel amazing. I always end up buying some after the good experience and I just never look back until I'm ready to quit again. This quit has been better because I know that I have to keep my attitude in check because the horrific symptoms aren't forever. And I just simply don't want to go through that again. Life is hard enough now.

Keep digging everyone. Make this year great because the outside world right now is in shambles. Be strong everyone.

I just can't tell if it's wearing off and these are the withdrawls or not. I'm used to the runny nose and other obvious ones. But it seems that I've dropped straight into lethargy and pissed at everyone, like literally finding an issue with every friend.

I was still experiencing hair loss for 2 weeks after I quit CT (hair still falling out when I run my fingers through it) but now around 4x less falls out with every shower (and some hair fall is normal) and I'm just happy that it's starting to look better!

I've been taking iron, zinc, b complex vitamin, some other supplements as well as washing my hair with biotin thickening shampoo twice a week and I think it's helping. 

If you're thinking about quitting I hope this post is inspiring, and what worked for me was:
Black seed oil - helps soooo much with sleep for me

L theanine - hit or miss, helps in the acutes

Exercise - practically mandatory in the acutes, helps with sleep and feeling better

Cold showers - best if done after exercise for that big rush

Weed (only if this is your thing) - I took mad edibles the first week for sleep and for feeling less shitty during the day. Keep in mind, I smoke a lot of weed and have been doing so for years, if you're new to weed maybe avoid thc or take it really slow.

Vitamin C - take 2g or up to 4-5 grams at night

Music - it helped immensely to have music playing 24/7. Laid back music that is mostly happy helped the most.

DONT:

Caffeine and alcohol - limit these as much as possible. Caffeine increases anxiety for me and had more negative experiences with alcohol than good. A couple drinks with dinner was mostly fine for me but beware of the hangovers which are worse than you think they'll be",11,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.8512267}"

No more jumpy legs, no racing thoughts, no hot/cold flashes, sleeping well. I had mentioned before that I'm a recovering alcoholic with over 7 years of sobriety, and for whatever foolish reason, I just decided to give Kratom a try one day. It was a horrible mistake. Since I decided to be done with the stuff on new years, I've started attending more AA meetings, which I really hadn't been attending due to Covid. I realized that I had been taking my sobriety for granted, and I'd just gotten a bit too comfortable. There's a saying in AA: ""While you're sitting in a meeting, your disease is out in the parking lot doing push-ups, waiting to kick your ass"". I'd always liked that saying, but I always just associated with the consumption of alcohol and nothing else. Now, with my ass thoroughly kicked, I realize that my addictive personality convinced me that kratom was a good thing. It's not booze, so no problem, right? Um...no. I only bring up AA because there are principles in that program that can help folks with every kind of addiction, including kratom. When you attend an AA meeting, you'll likely see a person who hasn't had so much as a drop of alcohol in years, or even decades. When this person introduces themselves, they always say ""I'm an alcoholic"". Why would a person whose been sober for so long still consider themselves to be alcoholic? The answer is this: we must never forget that we are sick people. We have these demons, and they will never completely disappear. We have to remain vigilant and never convince ourselves we are ""cured"". This is what I really want to communicate to everyone in this group. Remember that this thing is just itching to beat your ass. Don't let a few days, weeks, months or years convince you that you've learned your lesson and you can pop on down to the smoke shop and pick up a few shots or a bag of pills. The nightmare will start all over again. Take it a day at a time and reach out. There's strength in numbers, and no one should have to go through this alone.

I usually take tablets but also sometimes that popular brand (abbreviations almost identical to what many females go through once per month), usually in capsule form. I prefer tablets and average 6-8/day (around $40). When I notice less pay off, I sub a bit of the other brand here and there. However, I discovered that the capsules must have their own distinct chemical recipe because if I take them for several days, I get minor withdrawals. 

My daily normal is dealing with chronic pain, fatigue, circulation issues, muscle spasms, a really mean stomach that IBS-D just doesn’t cover, and PTSD + agoraphobia. With a toddler, doing the single mom jig. It’s a party over here! And it makes things a little more complicated.

I have a history of Rx opiod use (and abuse, as well as alcoholism), and was astonished when Kratom was introduced to me and was actually able to almost painlessly get me off a drug I thought I’d be stuck on for life. I detoxed off Suboxone (originally given for pain and rapid gastric emptying, not that it matters) once in 2018, by slowly tapering to nothing, and it was still the most grueling experience I’ve endured, minus pregnancy as a whole. For me, there are many reasons Suboxone is a bad idea for long-term treatment, so I won’t put that option back on the table. For one, it messed with my hormones to the point I was getting cysts oh my ovary and no period for a year. I know it also contributed to some other mental health difficulties (maybe all opioids would do those things?). Not to say Suboxone maintenance or Sub detox would affect anyone else this way. I’m fully aware I’m a unique flower and also fragile like a bomb. Suboxone almost killed me, with 3-4 weeks of acutes, lasting poor nutrient absorption that led to pernicious anemia and being stick thin; also a huge jump in baseline pain. I’m a pediatric occupational therapist but have never been able to stay on my feet career-wise since that experience. Unfortunately I chose to go back on subs when, 6 weeks postpartum, my stomach freaked out, and I felt I had no choice but to quickly find a way to be well enough to take care of a baby. Just hoped to jump off quickly.

Anyway, once I found Kratom, I started dosing frequently, as it decreased muscle rigidity and spasms and improved my mood. Soon I realized I depended on it to be emotionally functional, as my mood dipped fast if I didn’t take it every few hours. Frequent and large doses, but I eventually lowered it to 8gpd divided by 4-5/day and night. I’m a narcoleptic insomniac, so I have many night hours to get through. It was making me kind of crazy though, as far as mood.

Oh, worth mentioning I’m also dependent on a plethora of other meds, like 1-2 from every major class - given by doctors in fruitless attempts to improve my function. Methylphenidate ER and IR, clonazepam and/or temazepam, pregabalin, couple others. And not dependent but a barbiturate just got thrown in. I mention this as it might relate to effect, dependence, and withdrawal.

Kratom powder: I was dependent on it to the point I had to wake up in the middle of the night to dose and avoid withdrawal. For me, Kratom withdrawal is waking up soaked in sweat, hot but shivering, bones aching, stomach heaving. Yeah, opiate withdrawal. Maybe my past use of opiates is to blame for a physiology prone to this kind of withdrawal? Even at 8gpd

I initially steered clear of the extracts because one of the headshop employees laughingly told me “it get you f***ed up.” Tempting, but that’s not what I wanted Kratom for. Then a couple months ago, a girl at the headship offered me a free “shot.” It was free! So, yeah! 

I spend $200+/week on extract tablets. They did wonders for pain, initially. Now I mostly take them to avoid the depression and dysphoria that creep in when they wear off. Silver lining is, I guess they have a longer half-life, and I don’t have to wake up to drink mud.

What a glamorous life I live...

Ok, finally concluding. I’m being silly with the story, but I’m also very angry with myself, plus worried and scared about how this will go and turn out. Help? Advice? Keeping the medical and mental conditions in mind, knowing that at least a CT or too-quick detox would not only suck but hamper my ability to care for my 18-month-old. Even if acutes lasted 4 days (doubt that), if they were anything like what I started to see with the powder, I’d end up hospitalized like before (with a regimen of intravenous opiates most likely). 

Also... (sorry)! I’m determined to detox off or wean as low as possible on everything else, as I no longer know where my physical and mental baseline stand. After detoxing, I’ll be inpatient for a few weeks at a trauma recovery center (things are much more complicated than I can fit into this super long story).

It was a fucking nightmare, worst I've ever felt in my life, totally non-functional for a week, ended up in the ER, actually went on a short small bout of suboxone to come off. I was totally clean for about 6 months or so, felt great, completely back to normal.

Then about 2 months ago I succumbed to the delusion that I could just try a bit to ease the days a bit. This obviously didn't work, and I was using daily again, but have managed to keep it in the 10 gpd range (maybe a couple days 15-20) mostly due to a strong fear of consequences. I'm over it now and trying to taper. Down to about 8 gpd. I already feel pretty shitty - 5 hours of sleep, depressed mood and desire for nothing at all. I'm tempted to just jump and take a week of suffering, but curious to hear others' advice. I hear of people tapering down to like 1 mg - that's just never going to work for me. I don't feel any benefits and hardly even any withdrawal relief at 8 mg, to me tapering from here is just going to be 6/10 suffering for a month or longer, whereas jumping is going to be 7.5/10 suffering for a week. I suppose I could just try it out and if it became totally unbearable reinstate and go with the longer taper. Thoughts?",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.76724744}"

Has anyone gone this route before?

Never new exactly how much I was dosing as I drank tea. Been drinking it for over 2 1/2 years. Started hitting it hard in 2020. Originally would get it from the Kava bar then started making my own. 1/4 cup through a coffee pot twice. Was drinking about 5 16oz cups a day. Mostly between 3-7pm. First few days were tough physically but I pushed through, working out, going to work, drinking calming teas, doing all the things. I believe all the acute stuff has passed. Sleep is quite a bit better but wake up with shoulder pains every night. Been pushing my body super hard. Had a lot of energy the first week. Much more tired now but have to find stuff to keep busy or I will nap and I want to be able to sleep at night. About the last week I’ve had a lot of anxiety and anxious energy. Feeling pretty blah. If I think too far into the future I really get down as I know I have nothing to take away these feelings of restlessness and depression. They come and go. Exercise definitely helps but I can’t do it all the time and my body seems to be asking for a break. 
From reading through this sub it seems I may be dealing with PAWS. Will I ever be excited about life and have passions again? Thankfully music hits a lot better now and I think I want to learn the piano but the desire passes so quickly. I’m really just writing to share my experience and hopefully get a little input on if what I’m going through is normal and when I can expect to level out a bit more. 
The good news is I have no desire to dose as I easily recall how shitty I always felt.

I think when you absolutely hate whatever it is you’re using it’s much much easier to quit and stay away. 

If I took a shot right now I’m sure I would catch a little buzz. No doubt about it. For about 20 minutes. Then I would probably throw up and get a headache. And then maybe go through withdrawals all over again? After exactly 2 weeks clean!? Lmaoo Yeahhhhhhhh, I’m good.

So to fill you in if you're still reading :) - 

I initially quit my 40gpd habit almost a year ago, and since then I drink maybe 3-8 grams for like 2-3 or 2-4 day binges then only stop for one maaaaybe 2 days - this has been ongoing hell... felling like shit on the days i don't drink it (of course not as bad as the initial quit) and only looking forward to the days i let myself drink it.. then mixed emotions when i drink it like damn i let myself down again but wow it really helps my anxiety and uncomfortable in my own body feeling etc.. 

SO anyway, I'm sick of this back and forth and i do take magnesium and sodium ascorbate and some of the supplements mentioned on here, but i did get a script for gaba and clonidine yesterday. Doc actually tried to give me xanax and i said absolutely not. I got 30 300mg pills of gaba and I took one yesterday at work around 1pm... by like 5 at night at home i didn't feel as bad anymore and cleaned, cooked, took care of the baby, i didn't feel that heavy feeling inside, rls, or that depletion of dopamine which is great.  however, my addict mind was reading gaba forums on reddit and saw ppl saying the get a euphoric high from it so this morning i took a 300mg at 6:45 then another 300mg at 7:45. I have anxiety right now at work because i feel guilty like I'm replacing one thing with another - even though i don't plan on staying on these at all and I'm gonna tell my BF to hold them for me later.. i still feel guilty.. i just want to have a clear mind and not be on anything and be my natural self (i prob wont stop kava or weed though) but I guess i felt i needed the gaba to get through the RLS. IDK.. guess I'm just venting.. and now im starting to feel weird on the gaba but i don't know if it's just my anxiety. extreme dry mouth, head cloudiness, no euphoria lol.. i feel weird at work fml..

1. Quit cold Turkey and it was really rough for about 5 days, day 7 I started feeling human again. I went at least 5 nights in a row with only 1-2 hours of sleep. This was my worst quit.

2. I did a slow and gradual taper allowing my husband to administer my kratom according to my taper plan. It went well at first, but ultimately I ended up having several nights of no sleep again. 

3. My current quit. I did a rapid taper, then a micro dose once a day at the same time for a few days. Then stopped. I’m at 48 hours with no kratom now and have not had a sleepless night yet. The only difference is that this time I’m on a multi vitamin and have used 1:1 THC:CBD gummies in tiny amounts in the evenings a couple of times.

I don’t know why this method had so much less discomfort, struggle and general suck, but I thought I’d share because maybe it will help someone. Seems strange....I would have thought the slow taper would be the best.",24,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.44135943}"

EVERYONE. Do this for you. Do this for your wallet. Do this to break free from a negative habit. You guys got this. There is a better life on the other side of kratom addiction. Write down on paper the reasons that you are quitting. Do whatever it takes.

Sidenote: I have a very addictive personality, so that is why my kratom use got out of control. I believe that kratom could be a great tool for a lot of people without this trait as it was for me at the beginning of use.

Not as much the acutes (though I am nervous of them too) but even more worried of the PAWS and the mental aspect. That is already my greatest challenge as I already deal with MDD and anhedonia underneath my substance abuse. Today is also day 678 of no alcohol, so this is a little nerve wracking as quitting Kratom is the last barrier to actually calling myself sober and I’m very nervous about that. Kratom was essentially my last crutch. I will no longer have one thing as backup if I hit a point that I really really need to adjust my mind... 

I’ve tried to taper a couple times over the last 6 months. I always do pretty well until I get down to about 25 grams as then I start getting low enough where I don’t have enough allowable grams for the day to get one good high, and then I relapse. So cold turkey is the only possible way I will get there. I also quit a very heavy chewing tobacco habit only 27 days ago, so Kratom is the very last hurdle of ‘my bad habits.’ I suppose poor diet will still be there. But I think that will improve again once I’m no longer going without any food everyday in order to always have an empty for every single dose every 2-3 hours...

I've been off and on Kratom since late 2013. I've never been an every day user, and never huge doses. I've quit for months at a time before, but always came back.

I always had mild anxiety and depression, but I have to admit to myself that my biggest problems only came along after I started using Kratom. My OCD shifted into overdrive, paranoia and sometimes panic followed and I can't say that I've really been the same since. Even on ""good"" days, there's the threat of that knot in my stomach, creeping up and ruining yet another day, leaving me waiting til the sun goes down so I can be unconscious. I don't know for sure that it's the kratom, it could be just good old genetics finally catching up with me. (Mom, grandma both have terrible anxiety and ocd) but I figure it's worth a try to see how I feel after one year clean.

Overall, the last 2 weeks haven't really been that bad, surprisingly. During my taper, it was very aggressive and I always waited as long as I could until I had my first dose, which I personally believe allowed me to gradually experience withdrawal symptoms over the 7 days and when I eventually quit it was nearly painless. Nearly.

I still had cravings. But I was so sick of kratom that I refuse to go back. I still go to the kava bar all the time, where I'd have a majority of my daily kratom, I just don't drink kratom.

Emotionally it's been a bit difficult. I'm going through some changea in life, divorce, etc and quite frankly, I'm glad I'm not drowning my sorrows is numbing green sludge. I've been able to just process the anguish and change in much better ways.

Sleeping has been much, much better. I normally sleep through the night, though kratom did quell my horrible PTSD related nightmares. But the cost was far too high. I'd be horribly tired all day and a slave to that green slime.

10/10 would quit again.

Look, quitting kratom is uncomfortable. It's not fun. But there's a reward at the end, and it's your own sanity and mental health. Don't be dissuaded by the horror stories. Go through it. Listen to your body. You don't have to quit CT. But if you want to taper, you have to be ready to quit. You can't half ass it.

Panic attacks, heart palpitations, orthostatic hypotension, constant dizzyness, severe gut problems exercise and heat intolerance. All very unfamiliar to me as a 31 year old competitive distance runner. Basically become crippled over the last 4 months, lost over 25 lbs of muscles -- and am down to 149 lbs at 6'1, and 10% body fat.

All medical tests so far yielded zilch, and I've had a lot of major ones. I'm ostensibly normal, but have always had a whacky nervous system-- so naturally, I've come to suspect my old green friend is to blame.

Rapid tapered down to about 6-8 g a day over the last month, got covid, and its been rough! 4 days ago I decided dragging the taper any longer was prolonging the torture and jumped off. Suffering from some pretty incredible lethargy, cold hands and feet, and cramps -- but the dizzyness, panic attacks, and gut issues are already slacking off, and I suddenly love music again.

Still definitely is tough, but I slept almost 10 hours last night which was miraculous after sleeping 0 the night before because of severe restless legs. Libido is also through the roof, and I'm finding I'm unusually sharp in unexpected ways. Taking a lot of supplements to help, but no pharmaceuticals so far.

Overall very optimistic about the future and my recovery. 4 years is a long time worrying about every dose and all the horrible side effects that come with high tolerance.

An update a bit further along then I wanted to but forgot. Long post but may help those who are/were high energy people prior to kratom.

I say further along because on day 92 or 93 I was hit with the worst PAWS/Depression of them all. It was almost a week of bad mood, grumpy, and irritability. This was a bit scary because it was 10 days before Christmas and my second goal of being Kratom free on a holiday in over 6 years. It's like the brain knew I had the biggest hurdle ahead and now was the time to trip me up. My stubbornness allowed me to not give in. I said if I don't make it past new years with out a new attitude I can rethink jumping on.

I don't know when it stopped. It just passed. I didn't think about it. Christmas happened. Had a great time with family. No kratom pills. New Years happened. Same story. Only a week ago at day 130 CT did I realize I never made an update at 120 days CT. Like whaaaaaaaaaaat???? I'm glad I didn't mark it in the calendar as a reminder past 90 days.

So here I am day 136. Its a thing of the past. I don't think much about it at all. Things that I've come to understand and be happy about.

1. I was using Kratom (alcohol prior to it) to slow my mind down as if something was wrong with being a go getter. Right when I started (6 years ago) I had entered what will become my forever 9 - 5. At the time it meant I had to give up some extra curricular (extra energy and brain power using) hobbies. There was no need for me to always be on the go anymore. I had reached a goal to get that career job by working hard for roughly 5 years and I succeeded but my mind new I didn't need all that effort anymore. On top of that I had quite a catastrophe occur traveling abroad that wreaked havoc on my anxiety right before starting the new job. Seriously took a vacation to enjoy getting the job I wanted and ended up causing me to start late with emotional scars. Thus using a substance to be okay being lazy or to get that extra will power when I need stimulation was my way of controlling myself better I thought. Really it was just the substance controlling me and changing me for what I thought I needed?

\------How do I know this? All these hobbies have come back. Working out again with logs, I'm cooking intricate meals again (takes a long time), playing music (was chasing the music career), reading, back to practicing sports. I had a long thought about what got me into using Kratom. I've made peace with the incident that occurred prior to the job. I can look back and not be petrified or uneasy.

2) Being okay with being okay. I'm good realizing prior to this substance I always ran at a faster pace then most. Using it to my advantage and not being over bearing to others has really helped my job. May 2020 I received a promotion in the same company. Yet in the past month I've made more advances with new ideas all the while feeling like things are easier. Is this because of quitting kratom? Or is this because I'm six months in and feeling comfortable? It is hard to say but I can say this last month has me interested in ways I wasn't in the past 5.5 years (didn't need to be because I was masking it over with Kratom).

3) I can watch movies again without a substance. Think about how crazy that sounds. This goes back to my being okay with being okay. This was always a hard thing for me to do. Alcohol or Kratom was a must for movies since leaving college. This is the first time in twelve years I haven't had at least a beer on hand or two grams of kratom to watch a movie. I always hated the Christmas/New Years movie binges. This time I did it happily and couldn't believe it.

I'm losing a bit of steam now. I'll write down any other things I come up with. But really its is all about me being okay with being that high energy person. I am back to going to sleep when my eyes want to. Waking up early whether to workout or enjoy making breakfast or whats on TV. I'm okay not having to have a purpose but also not needing to tone down my mind from not having to think about a purpose.

I didn't think that I could use kratom to numb pain like I used to with alcohol so that was a bit of an eye opener. 

Anyway, now I'm on the low security ward of a psychiatric hospital and I haven't told them about my habit. They gave me a piss test but I guess they don't test for that anyway. My mood has been terrible but that's why I came here in the first place,I really don't think it's because of the withdrawal.

The worst part by far has been the restless legs, oh god. Every night is like a kickboxing match while I try to sleep. I cannot WAIT for this part to be over, anyone have an idea how long that takes? I can feel them getting ready for tonight. 

I've been receiving lorazepam (benzos) for the anxiety which is presumably not recommended. That is an addictive drug in itself and if I end up taking it too long, I'll probably end up back on the kratom to deal with the withdrawal. So that's great.

Even just texting them seems like a huge effort.  

I often wonder how many potential relationships or friendships the kratom habit and it’s self induced manic depressive cycles has cost me.

Hoping my resolve stays firm as if anything the slip yesterday reminded me how crappy kratom is .. I know really getting clean takes a lot longer than a week though it also seems once people pass a few weeks or a month they seem to disappear till they return to write a year update.  I take comfort knowing I’m trying and seeing so many good examples of people who did same and gradually got it right and quickly came to forget kratom ..

My goal and resolve is to keep quitting and stay quit.  So far not feeling any urge or temptation to do anything but sit down.  Going to try and follow the advice to resume exercising.  I was doing great but I live in Oregon which has effective but ongoing closures of gyms n such and gym closed 2 months ago.  Was running for awhile but during an attempted quit in mid December I tried to use klonopin as a ‘comfort med’ and that stuff really imbalanced me.  10 days r very gray n blurry and after I stopped that lots of my routines seemed kinda knocked over.

Besides the fatigue and sense of complete disinterest in everything I don’t feel sick .. had a minor hot flash but feels like I didn’t fall back into acutes.  They really weren’t bad as I’d been tapering for a long time.. by taper tho I really mean I was trying to quit tomorrow for a long time and kept buying an ounce bag daily, taking 2 doses, then flushing it.. again n again.  Reminds me of someone with a mostly healed broken leg refusing to give up my crutches.

Still, each time I get some time then give in I KNOW I’m reactivating the addiction and based on my calendar I track these things with each ‘just once’ tends to last a week or month ..

Hopefully I’ll finally get this right.  If not once gathering in groups is allowed again I’m just gonna join NA or something.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46207333}"

On day 10, its been a hell of a fucking ride. I was at 60 gpd back at that start of December and just wrapping up a phenibut taper. I would like to say supplementing for things like serotonin(5htp/SAMe) and dopamine(L-tyrosine/DL-PA) have been invaluable for keeping my mood stable. Of course the first week off regardless of where you jump off is going to be a battle of willpower. 

The reason for my post today is bc over the weekend I ended up ""celebrating"" feeling better from the kratom kick by going on a ketamine bender. I had somehow convinced myself that this would aid in the recovery process. I know a lot of people have used ket in a clinical session to help with depression, and Im all for that. But my lack of self control was on full display over the weekend, and when I came out of the cloud on Monday I was in a full blown depressive episode. Thankfully ket withdrawal and recovery is a lot faster, but I was desperately trying to avoid feeling like shit and thought about relapsing on kratom and phenibut. I didn't,  but I have both in my house and I seriously considered it. I didn't do it but the point is if you have multiple substance addiction issues, one tends to lead into another. 

If you've made it to a point where you're feeling better, and and you're thinking about using ket to help with the depression/anhedonia, just make sure you're doing it in a clinical session where you have accountability. I was reading through some of the Ket posts in this group and didnt really see that piece of advice and wanted to share my experience.

Im feeling a lot better today, I know I still have a road ahead of me now that the post Ket blues have mostly passed but after all the despair Im incredibly hopeful. This group has been a cornerstone in my recovery process from both kratom and the phenibut. Stay strong everyone, dont know what I would do without you.",3,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.46636775}"

I thought from what I read anyone who did early withdraw way.. was at A LOT higher gpd than me. So couldn’t be that bad. Right????!!! WRONG. 

I took about 1/4 IF EVEN THAT of a 50 mg Naltrexone. 30 minutes later it was bad. I made the mistake of eating right after taking it. I was so hungry... I hadn’t ate that much throughout the day. So I was starving. 

Threw up all of my meal.. plus some. Stomach cramps so terrible. And cold cold cold. I kind of enjoyed the cold somewhat. Considering I’ve been so hot taking Kratom. That I haven’t even needed a jacket being outside at 40 degrees. I had three blankets. My bathrobe. And warm long PJ Pants and a tank top. 

I felt like I was just in another world. I threw up so bad I peed all over the bathroom floor... no control. The restless legs was all over my body. And cramps so bad. Lasted about four or five hours. After that.. I still had stomach cramps that came on about every 20 minutes and slowly got further and further apart as time went on. 

I am feeling very weak. I managed to take the dogs out around 9am. To come back up two flights of stairs and throw up water with more cramps in my stomach. (I started all this at 7:30pm and withdraws starting at 8pm) 

It’s noon now and I’m now able to walk around without feeling too weak. I managed to eat some plain pretzel chips (four of them) and some soda pop (coke wish I had sprite) restless legs are minimal and back little worn out sore feeling. 

I’m hoping now it’s pushed out the opiates. I don’t have a craving for it ever ever again.. well at least I feel this way now. It was terrible. 

Not sure if I would recommend this. Battle for 6-7 years.. one year sober from it sometime in between. So I’ve done this on and off for quite some time... so long that the people at the shop I get it from are rooting for me to get better.

I've been addicted to a lot of different things over the years leading me to believe that most substances and I don't get along. As a teenager it was whatever the neighbor kid had or whatever I could find in the medicine cabinet. Then it progressed to Adderall for a few years when I started dating someone who had a prescription and gave them to me because she enjoyed them so much she wanted to share the feeling (I also picked up smoking during this time because she was a smoker and I wanted to be more like edgy or something, who knows). Then, when I quit that I switched to drinking heavily for about 8 years or so..

 When my mom died 4 years ago, I quit smoking (she died from cancer), and I quit drinking 6 months later due to a realization that my life wasn't going to get any better unless I made it better. Fast forward with a few years of sobriety, I started dating someone who drank and smoked weed pretty heavily, while I remained sober. I think constantly being around that made me really crave having my ""thing"" again so I went looking for legal/herbal means to get somewhat of a buzz without ruining my sobriety (I know now that this is essentially cheating and isn't at all logical, hindsight is 20/20). I ended up finding kratom during this time.. I thought it was too good to be true, the honeymoon phase that I'm sure many of us have had with the deceptive leaf. I was amazed that there was a legal drug I could just buy at the store that felt like taking a Vicodin, opiates were always my favorite, I just never sought them out, I'd binge on them when I was prescribed but then I'd just deal with the suck when I ran out. Kratom, on the other hand, is so easy to get I developed a nasty dependency on it. I struggled on and off with kratom after I realized the horrible withdrawals it caused. I ended up leaving the partner I was with and started taking kratom pretty heavily to deal with being by myself. 

I started going on dating apps here and there still claiming I was sober and neglecting to mention that I was still struggling with kratom pretty heavily (I think this was due to my own denial at that point, not as much to deceive people). I also began to dabble in Phenibut (super scary stuff) and other research chemical type drugs. I met someone who I really got along with who was sober and had never touched any sort of alcohol or drug besides coffee. She had parents who abused alcohol pretty heavily and a dad who almost died from his, he has since gotten and remained sober. We dated for about 3 months until I told her about my kratom problem. It was a pretty big deal at the time and almost broke us but she stayed with me, I was only able to stay sober for a few weeks during this quit attempt. Then I continued to use behind her back, sneaking it in her bathroom when I was at her house like a junkie. I really hate the things this drug does to me as a partner, it makes me deceptive and tell a lot of half-truths. 

Fast forward 6 months from this, and I finally had the courage to tell her again. I flushed all my stash and got helper meds to help with the withdrawals (I was taking A LOT of kratom, I don't know my daily dose but my withdrawals were terrible, with PAWS for about 2 months after). I had been sober for 7 months until the end of December. For whatever reason, I went on autopilot and the thought entered my head to ""just get some kratom for one night since I'm on break and I've been feeling stressed"". That was 3 weeks ago now and since then, I've been taking >3 extract shots per day. I told my SO about the relapse after a week, then tried to stop but couldn't, then I told her again a week after I couldn't quit that I was still taking it and tried to quit again. I caved and got more after a few days of withdrawals. So I just told her again today that I wasn't able to quit still. I'm left feeling like the worst partner ever and a giant piece of crap. I'm so upset at myself for that moment of weakness, where I didn't take into account all the hell I've gone through with this plant, and all the hell I've put my partner through. I'm trying to do the right thing and be honest with her, but I'm so scared she's going to leave me (which would be understandable. It just makes me feel so unlovable being an addict, that once I truly allow people in I'll just hurt them and get hurt myself in the process. And still, despite all this, I loaded up on extract shots today and got enough to last me a few days (or two days if I'm being honest to myself) and I STILL can't find it in me to flush them.

Thanks for reading my whole life story if you've made it this far (haha), I just needed somewhere to vent and put all this in writing. If this post prevents a relapse in just one person and reminds them how insidious this plant can be and the havoc it wreaks on relationships, I'll be happy.

You guys are so inspirational, I love reading your posts, even the bad ones. It reminds me how incredibly strong people can be when we put our minds to something that we actually care about and come together. 

So I dosed 1.25grams this morning after an aggressive taper down in the last few days. It’s been exactly 12 hours since that last dose. I’m trying to resist the urge to dose, but I feel that familiar restlessness, and I’m not sure if sleep will happen right today. 

So, I’m unsure whether I should jump. I was thinking of trying to get down to 0.5 grams per day then jumping. I’m off every substance now except Kratom and nicotine. But it’s really hard to shake the cravings. I’m taking NAC at 1200mg/day which supposedly helps cravings. Is there anyone out there at a similar daily dose that’s also struggling to kick it entirely?

It’s like, *man*, do I wanna dose! It’s something about that brief calmness it provides for a few hours... I don’t get much of a euphoria from such low doses, more like relief from my brain begging for any kind of substance (weed, alcohol, etc). 

Best of luck everyone! If you’re in the midst of the suck - worse than me - than know that it gets better. I’m near the tail end. One of the things that’s really helped me is limiting myself so I *never* dose more than my last dose.

On a positive note, I haven’t felt any cravings or desire to use kratom since I started my cleanse. Maybe that will be a challenge I face later.
Does anyone have a suggestion for the body aches/tingling/discomfort? I’m loading up on Tylenol and ibuprofen but it isn’t making a dent. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you and best wishes to everyone on here.",5,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.7252739}"

I've suffered from bad anxiety (which is manageable at the moment), fatigue and low mood (not MDD) for some years now, and after telling my doctor my symptoms he prescribed wellbutrin. I refused SSRIs because I took zoloft once and it made me emotionless and more depressed. wellbutrin seems like the best option as far as psych drugs go for my fatigue and low mood due to its stimulant properties. I take many supplements already but they're just not quite doing enough. I'm just wondering if anyone here has taken wellbutrin, and did it help with your recovery? I know it's not wise to rush into taking meds early into withdrawals, but I think it is appropriate as I had the symptoms before kratom.

Honestly day one through four more better but also today I slacked off on some of myself care so that makes sense. I've been religious about doing my wim Hof breathing techniques and cold punches three times a day. Today I've done one of each. I did some mild exercise but still kind of feel that anhedonia. Feel lethargical I had some cravings this afternoon which honestly was the first time since I quit day 1. 

The power of the mind is incredible. Part of quitting is really deciding and making a strong intention in the mind. I've been to rehab before and it was similar .. it wasn't hard to stop drinking cuz I was done... Ass kicked .. miserable .. suicidal.. I have kids and a wife. Anyway I'm saying when you really fucking decide something in the depths of your being the first 90 are easier.

they're still going to be that point for the pink cloud goes away and the old you comes back to old you that was convinced taking kratom was a good idea the old you that rationalized that bullshit. And that's when the real hard work starts which is actually learning to live differently to be different to respond to life in situations differently to find a new way to live. 

That my friend says the only way for long-term recovery. And I'm going to be honest I have some fucked up trauma from my childhood. A very high percentage of addicts also have fucked up trauma and their childhood. I highly recommend finding professional help if you can and addressing the core issue because treating the symptom is bullshit and will not last and I feel like the majority of addiction treatment is that. I've done the steps I've done the 12-step thing that's great the steps will help but for me it was not enough I also need a professional therapist. 
I also need yoga, I also need meditation, I also need regular time and nature. I also need regular creative expression I am an artist I am a musician I need to fucking beat on shit scrape shit make shit express myself to be happy.

I can't be in a work environment that is stressful and where I'm not valued and keep my sobriety so I have worked for myself since 2008 and I also have seen that a shitty job is a nice recipe for relapse.

I'm rambling but thanks you guys another fucking day clean and I can't wait to get this kratom garbage completely behind me.

I quit Kratom, CT, on 1/1/21. I was using 3 extract shots a day, somewhere around 50-60 gpd. I used for about a year total. 
I have a long history of drug abuse. I have been to rehab 5 times, and multiple detox centers. That’s not a brag, it’s sad. BUT on 2/22/2018, I got clean at my last treatment. Made it two years to around Feb 2020, complete abstinence, AA, all of that. I started to get pretty bad anxiety, was in a vape shop one day getting some coils, and I bought some Kratom. I researched it, being an ex opiate addict, “from what I read” it appeared it may be beneficial. My first mistake was in talking to no one about it, and rationalizing the whole time. 
Fast forward a year, and I finally came to my senses, decided enough was enough and this life was no more appealing now than it was 3 years ago. Just thought I would stop. 
Well, I did, on the first. Full blown withdrawals, made it 7 days, with a fever and freezing cold the whole time. I finally couldn’t take the cold anymore and caved to  oral morphine, low dose, for a week. It took away most of my withdrawals (no duh, right?). Stopped the morphine yesterday and have started to experience mild withdrawals again. I know I just paused it, but did I fully reset it?

It's work, this is a difficult time, I don't do everything I'm supposed to every day, but I just can't describe how much this has improved my life.

Focusing on the here and now, but also very hopeful for the future, as with good physical and mental health, every situation is manageable and anything is possible.

I would say i feel back to normal, but to be honest i dont remember how i was before kratom since it was so long ago and i was only 17 (21 now). But kratom almost ruined my life. It caused my overall addiction to get way worse, as it made me used to/feel like i have to dose whatever im taking multiple times a day. When i first quit after 6 months for 3 months i started going on benders, drinking taking pills and any drug that came my way for days on end, and then i would wake up and feel like complete shit, and during one of those hangovers, i gave up and got more kratom. I spent all my money on it and weed, while i was in college. I literally spent all my savings plus maxed out my credit card at one point. I was too depressed to try to get a job, I was suicidal, cutting myself so much, which i had never done prior to using kratom. I completely failed a semester of school, and dropped out because i had no motivation to stay. I moved back home and sat in my room for 9 months drinking kratom and feeling ashamed. I also started getting seziures from kratom and it still didn't make me stop. I had 9 fucking seziures because of kratom, and every time my arm would dislocate, and it got to the point I could barely use it cause it would fall out of the socket so easily, I ended up having to get surgery on it. i finally worked up the courage to quit and go through withdrawal, and it was the best choice i ever made. It has been a difficult experience overall, filled with depression, loneliness, and anhedonia. But its worth it, because i dont have to be ashamed of myself anymore. Im not sneaking off to dose 3 times a day, im being more productive than i have been in years, im actually talking to girls again and i even got laid lol. My life is still so far from where i want it to be, but it makes me so happy that im finally moving forward instead of sitting still at rock bottom.

I for one quit CT almost 5 years ago now, but really that’s a lie. I’ve had small “relapses” in my journey over the years. I bought 5 Vicodin from a friend here. Tried an oxy there. But one thing has stayed strong which is my strong will to live a mostly sober life. I never let those feelings of wanting to ride the opiate horse takeover. I see a lot of people that are 90 days or even 1 year clean who think their battle is mostly over but it’s never over! If you think your battle is over you might fail at the next temptation.

I found this site somewhat by accident. I have been an on again off again kratom user for about three years. I used to work in marketing for a large retail outlet, and originally tried Kratom because I received a few samples of liquid shots and capsules from a vendor. I have no history of substance abuse, but I liked it because it made me feel chipper, so I found a local shop and continued taking it in powder form. 
I must have been totally oblivious, but now I realize that each time in the last year or so that I stopped taking the product for days at a time, I would get sick and just generally feel shitty. I never once thought I was having withdrawal symptoms until now. 
I’ve stopped taking the product after reading the posts on this site and I am experiencing flu like symptoms such as extreme fatigue and body aches. Perhaps the most significant symptom though is the panic attacks/sense of dread that I’ve had today and yesterday. There have been times where I’ve experienced shortness of breath and I’m having trouble doing the most basic things around the house without having to lay back down. Has anyone experienced this??

So I came in here and posted things about how ""maybe I should really quit"", or ""Boy that was hard, why do I want to keep doing this?"".

But evidently I had not really reached the level of misery necessary to stick to those guns.  So about 3 weeks later.. Why not take a little to reward myself?

Ugh.  So sad.

Well y'all know it.  By the summer I was shoveling through kilos like a mulching mower.

The next quit?  Well here we are... took 5 tries.  I tried 2 CTs.  Made it less than 48h each time.  And I tried two well planned spreadsheet based tapers. Too rigid, and too fast.  So I did the third taper by feel.  Bingo.  And this plan feels Juuuust right said the baby shoobabear!

Speaking of feel.. I quit!  nearly a year later after joining this sub.  And **I FEEL GREAT!!!**  Well sort of... I also sort of feel like baked shit.  But that's OK because THIS time... I really do think I can hang on.  And I am thankful to all of you especially those who went before as examples, and especially especially those who are quitting with me today!  Class of 20/21?

I think I’m very afraid of the consequences of quitting cold turkey personally. I’d like this to be as easy on me as possible as I’ve been using daily for a very long time now. I’m also scared as I heard a rumor a while back that you could potentially die quitting cold turkey. I just don’t have enough knowledge yet to choose a path. But I would like to do it in the time before I find my next full time job. I’d just like to be free of this stuff and I know that if I quit this time. That it will be forever. I don’t want to go through this again.

I invite you to grow through this process with me.","I quit 3 other drugs, along with kratom January 1st of this year, Nicotine, caffeine and Phenibut. I was doing well, very well, but then PAWS kicked in a few nights ago and the insomnia came out of nowhere and hit me hard. 

This resulted in me having a small relapse today, but a relapse nonetheless. The reason of this post isn’t to inform everyone of my relapse, it’s to inspire everyone. 

The amount of strength and drive that I have gained because of this relapse is going to push me through PAWS and into complete sobriety. I broke down and started crying earlier, after I calmed down, I wrote this note in my phone. 

“These next 14 days will determine how the rest of your entire year goes. 

Will you be living at the Ecco on orange in Orlando spending time with your siblings every weekend, going to amusement parks, having fun, living life and providing for your family? 

Or will you still be living with your grandmother or in some shitty apartment barely getting by, paycheck to paycheck and addicted to drugs? The choice is yours.

It all comes down to what you decide to do these next 14 days. I know it’s been tough, I know it’s been difficult, I know you’ve been fighting with everything you’ve got, not just over these last 18 days but over the last 13 months. I know there’s been many times where you just wanted to break down and cry and say fuck it all. Trust me, I know. 

But you must understand, you’re so fucking close, now is not the time to break. You’ve come way to fucking far, you’ve been through way to much to just give up now. Everything is lined up, everything is there for the taking, it’s just waiting for you to sober up. 

Now is the time to buckle down and give it everything you’ve got, one final push. You need to use every fucking ounce of will power in you, every fiber of your being, everything you have, you need to use it all to push through these next for 14 days. Say to yourself, I will die before I give up. I will die before I let my family down again, before I let myself down again. 

I am only moving forward! 2021 is my fucking year, and there is nothing that no one can do to stop me. The only person standing in my way is me. Nothing else. I have complete control, and I will not fail.”

Also curious if anyone has taken red reishi or lions mane extract during w/d?,"Baicalein is derived from Chinese skullcap and works on the benzo receptors. While working on these receptors as far as I can tell it is not strong enough to actually get addicted to(from what I’ve read, haven’t taken it long term myself yet). More anxiolytic than sedative but definitely helps me relax. Also a very effective anti inflammatory. Also also(and possibly best of all) it inhibits an enzyme in your liver that processes thc thus making your weed stronger and last longer. Be sure not to take it if you are on other medicines processes by this enzyme. A really good triple threat against w/d imo. 

Edit: if you try the stuff be sure not to buy baicalin as it is a version that does not cross the bbb. Lift mode sells em both. But stay away from that damn phenibut! Every single time I get off kratom I get hooked of pheni due to insomnia.

Curious if anyone uses red reishi or lions mane during withdrawal? Tried them both twice at the very end of my taper but am concerned they might not go so well during the full blown acutes. I’m at 72 hours and feeling much better today.

Edit #2: decided to experiment on myself a bit and can say lions mane at 72 hours was a huge mistake! Made everything much worse. However today is day 5 and I tried the red reishi and it was excellent. Very calming but also has a non jittery energy at the same time. Really helped my back pain too. Only down side is that it is absolutely awful for your testosterone so I don’t plan to take it more than a couple days. Not sure if it would have went so well during the first 48 hours either but really nice for when the worst is over and you’re still having anxiety/motivation/pain issues.

That logic warped into part of me trying to convince the rest of me to maybe have a little kratom then quit coffee and kratom tomorrow... such addict logic.  Trying to visualize that tho.. dosing then getting all manic for 30 minutes then getting nauseous as it wears off, wanting more and the likelihood it might be another few weeks or months before I manage to quit again ... day 8 will b the day I go further than before tho so trying to stay focused.

So far despite the craving n feeling my body trying to compulsively walk to head shop I want to resist.  Despite the edginess I definitely feel a lot better already.  Even in craving and too much caffeine I feel a certain peace .  A certain freedom to not be thinking about when I’ll dose and planning my day around it and fact after dosing I’ll just melt into couch and likely do what I’ll do anyway.. tho in being off kratom the possibility I might do something else seems possible too !

I could not go back to work until day 8.
I was eating VERY clean throughout the entire DT, and stacked many supplements, it's important to do your own research on what may help you.
For RLS (Restless legs, very common, awful symptom), I took: Magnesium citrate 1,250mg at night in two seperate doses about 3 hours apart, cleared the RLS immediately, slept through the whole night. From then on it was 500 mg every night (empty stomach is best) until I ran out (two days ago), just in case, and I have been good.
I have been taking about 1000mg ibuprofen everyday throughout the withdrawal as well as smoking weed and taking my increased dose of benzodiazepines.
I am addicted to caffeine, so every morning when I wake up I usually try to drink/ my vitamins and let them settle first (10-15 min) then sit on the toilet, and if nothing happens within 10 min, I make a strong cup of instant joe that I've been itching for anyway, and then chug that and my business will follow soon after.

IMPORTANT: Choose your meal times well and avoid too much sugar, ESPECIALLY around bedtime. I tried to always eat so that I had AT LEAST 2 hours before bed to digest, eating too soon before bed will really impact your sleep quality, and being in a WD state, sleep is your number one friend.

I utilized intermittent fasting and my first meal would always be around 1230-100pm EST and would ONLY be a Whey Isolate (hydrolyzed would be better, more expensive) shake, 40g protein, with an 'Immune Defense' powder mix serving that had fruit and veggie fibers, prebiotics, mushrooms, and some added vitamins in it. I would also take vitamins with this.

Vitamins I take daily during any WD:
Milk thistle 350mg
Dhea 100mg
Pqq 10mg
Ubiquinol 100mg
Theanine 200mg
Multi vitamin 
Super B complex 
Zinc gluconate 100mg
Calcium, magnesium, zinc, d3 combo pill (1000mg/400mg/15mg/600iu[15mcg], respectively)
Fish, Flaxseed, and Borage oil combo pill (800mg/800mg/400mg, respectively)
St John's Wort 300mg

I feel back to my old self again, although I feel psychologically it may present itself sometimes in waves. 
Hope this helps.

Update: it has been two months, all signs of WD are gone, and I am happy to be rid of it. I cant believe I drank that stuff for so long.",9,{'immun': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.47617605}"

Let me tell you also that it definitely has not been easy, in fact I feel like shit while writing this, but honestly I’m so grateful just to FEEL anything! Even if it’s not so pleasant.

I’m probably butchering that but the overall meaning I took deep into my heart when I read it the second day of taking nothing, whenI was absolutely feeling my worst.

So I’m just here to reiterate that. Keep fighting the good fight! And if you have to use supplements or even taper, that’s OK. I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to go cold turkey either, and I came off heroin 5 years ago in a jail cell. This is definitely not as horrible, but it sure as hell ain’t easy.

I want to preface this by saying that I am in the process of quitting kratom. I know that if something is hurting you then you shouldn’t keep it in your life, but of course this is an addictive drug. 

I have had chronic nerve pain in the right side of my neck and shoulder for over 2 years. This started before taking kratom. I have noticed that whenever I take kratom the pain that I already have seems to be exacerbated. The baseline pain is a burn, but with the drug it makes my neck and shoulder feel like it’s on fire. 

I find it really odd that it causes me to have more pain when an overwhelming amount of post/articles/scientific studies point to kratom as an analgesic. So it’s been quite literally impossible to find anything that points to kratom causing pain.

Dear all

Ive been contemplating a while if I would post this but I decided to give it a go, even if noone reads it I think I'll be glad I wrote everything down.So to start off, how did I get to this point?Well I had a standard wisdom tooth extraction surgery back in October 2019. Sadly there were lots of complications leading to me almost dying. I had three surgeries in 48 hours, I suffered lots of blood loss and blood/iron deficiency for months.

I was prescribed Tramadol (without the tylenol added) 150mg sublingually 3x a day.

Needless to say it worked well. Not only was the pain more manageable, it also made me feel very chilled out.

Even after the pain subsides and I was healed, I continued using the rest of the tablets of Tramadol. It made me feel so at ease with everything. I'm a person that tends to overthink and overanalyze, leading to anxiety.

When I ran out of tramadol, I didn't suffer any withdrawal but I did miss it mentally. A couple of months later I decided, I want the chill feeling back and I got into Kratom. It was awesome, I had the chill opioid feeling, yet I was energized. It was perfect for my long grueling shifts at work.

Fast forward to now, January 2021, after 6+ months of Kratom use, I feel generally bad. Nauseous, fatigued, irritable, ZERO libido, ... Kratom doesn't really work anymore. I just need it to get by. The positive effects faded; it used to energize me and make me feel great. Now it just wears me down, and makes me feel ill.

I found this reddit group and realized I had made a fatal mistake. I had thought Kratom was without negative effects, but I was wrong; as you all know.

It's been ages that I've felt truly happy. I attribute it to my 6+ years of Phenibut use (which I can't seem to shake, because I'm scared for WD. I just can't take the plunge. But I've stabilized my use to 2.5gr a day, compared to 5gr+ a day previously).Kratom actually made me feel alive and good in the beginning, but now nothing makes me glad anymore, not even slightly.

I'm throwing away my life.

I'm dependent on a disgusting green mucky drink every 3 hours.

I want to get rid of my Kratom dependency so I can feel ""reasonable"" again. And then hope to take care of my Phenibut dependency, so I can maybe actually know what it is to feel happiness again.

Anhedonia has been part of my life for years.

&#x200B;

Wish me luck everyone. Thank you for this group and reading my long post.

EDIT :

DAY 1: Morning started alright but started having some chest tightness and anxiety as the day went on. Actually felt somewhat alive today, and had genuine feelings and emotions, feels like. Tonight the tightness and anxiety subsided but made way for a sort of melancholy feeling along with restless legs that are driving me mad already (and I've not even gone to bed yet). I walked my dog 4 times today to keep busy (she didn't mind :p) along with playing some Cyberpunk 2077 on the pc. Didn't do much else. Will go to bed soon. L-Theanine 200mg, Valerian 450mg, Zinc 22mg, Magnesium 200mg and 5-HTP 100mg is on the menu first.

2021-01-16 23:22:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/kyz99d/day_30_1month/,Day 30 - 1Month!,"Hi All,

The following is my experience and I do realize not all experiences are the same. 

For the longest time I had built up all of these thoughts / ideas about how life would be without Kratom. I told myself the withdrawals would be to tough, the paws would cripple me and that my personality was better on Kratom.  If only I knew how wrong I was and how good I would be feeling in just 30 days. 30 days out from quitting kratom I feel basically 100%.  So for those of you who are thinking of quitting I hope this gives you so hope! 

Background story: From 2010-2013 I was a heavy user of opiates.  Any opiates I could get my hands on I would and I was using lots.  Id say for over 2 years I was high everyday on oxy, fent, H or a mix of all 3. Eventually I hit my bottom and sobered up. 

2015-2020 life was so good.  I would have never imagined how much I could accomplish in such a short time with my head on right.

2020 (March) Covid hits and I need a break. Ive checked off a bunch of boxes I never thought id hit in regards to relationships and financials. Im home not depressed or anything actually quite the opposite life is amazing and I deserve to relax and take a break (I know that sounds insane). So I order some stuff off the dark web and one thing leads to another and its been 6 weeks of hard opiate use. This time is different though because i realize everything i worked so hard for is slipping away. I am a useless human being when im high I accomplish 1/20th of what I do sober.  I quit ct, and after about 3 days pick up some kratom based on a recommendation online. Wow kratom is amazing this miracle drug... Well we know how that goes. So finally after 6 weeks of harder opiates and 7 months of 30-50 gpd of kratom I quit on December 17th.  

Days 1-5 Acutes 

Definitely the worst part of the withdrawal process. Every minute feels like an hour and its hard to distract yourself from the discomfort. I did use a sleep aid/ anxiety aid (xanax) through these days which was extremely helpful. I only used it at night, but I really think this helped make these first days bearable. So if you are looking to quit the one thing i would reach out to your doctor for is something that will put you to sleep for 6 hours for the first week. The insanity of RLS + insomnia will drive a lot of people back to using.  Knowing you have some peace to look forward to (sleep) during the first week is extremely helpful. 

I recommend you stay as active as possible during this time.  I basically rotated exercise and hot baths 3-4x per day during this time period.  Going for a 30 minute walk listening to music followed by a hot bath was extremely therapeutic. Basically anything besides music or exercise would have me thinking about my discomfort.  So if you are an active person push yourself to stay active. Try to hit 10,000 steps a day or 20 push ups every hour... whatever it is you feel you can do. I went for a bunch of longer drives days (3-5) to distract myself for a couple of hours.  I found anything active helpful and sitting on the comp / watching TV was counter productive and had me just thinking about how miserable I was. 

Days 6-10 

Things started to get better. I got off all helper meds during this time (flushed everything) and actually was able to sleep at least 4-6 hours a night. I went right back into my normal workout routine to push myself. I think exercise was the most significant part of my recovery. The exercise is good for the mind while in the act and the endorphins released during have you feeling great for the few hours after.  During these early days having 3-4 hours during the day when you actually feel good is extremely important hence why I continued to exercise. Additionally it leads to better sleep and I feel like it helped with the RLS. Basically. exercise helps in every way. The acutes were much milder during this period, but still there in waves. 

Days 11 - 14 

Overall these were the days when things really started to get better.  Most of my day I felt good and I really started to get back into a routine and get distracted in life.  Kept up with the exercise routine. 

Day 15 - 20

Went back to work after a 2 week + break.  Some symptoms like RLS, Sneezing, Boredom, Lack of motivation are still there, but almost completely gone. Overall these days im feeling pretty good with the occasional bad hour or two. 

Days 21 - 24

The last of the RLS and other lasting symptoms disappear. 

Days 25 - 30 

Life gets back to normal. The symptoms have all basically dissipated.   One day I woke up and didn't even think about how good I felt because its normal to feel good.  Only after a couple of days do I realize damn ive been feeling great and the days are flying by. If you read my updates I was pretty consistent the first 3 weeks, but the last 5 completely forgot as I was feeling good and the days were flying by. 

My biggest recommendation is to stay as active as you can. 

On a side note last night I had my first Kratom dream.  It wasn't a dream about getting high, but a dream about being back in withdrawals. I was so disappointed I had let myself once again get back to that place.  I was so happy when I woke up that it was just a dream, but it felt so real. 

I hope this gives some motivation to those who are thinking about quitting.  My journey through recovery is just beginning, but it can be amazing if you push yourself. I hope this helps motivate someone to take the leap.

Just was curious to everyone’s experience...I was on 20mg daily for 4.5 months. I decided quitting cold turkey would be best for me just because I want this crap out of me ASAP. I’m also recovering from surgery and after so much research really think it’s the kratom making me recovery so slowly. (None of my doctors know what kratom is so have no perspective but kerp saying they don’t know why it’s taking so long to recover compared to most people with this surgery...really think it’s kratom related) 

Anyways on day 4 now and the withdrawals suck...dizziness, nausea, insomnia, nightmares, panic attacks, headaches and honestly just over all feeling so freaking out of it. Also insanely bad sweating and body temp going up and down. Just trying to get some perspective of everyone else’s experience with how long they used/dosage to try to get a feel of how long withdrawals will last and if maybe they would last shorter for less than a year of using? I know that in general first week is physical and next weeks are more emotional but do you guys think the withdrawals could be less depending on how long you used? I hope this post even makes since. I just really didn’t expect to have this bad of withdrawals for only using less than 5 months but that was probably dumb to expect....Any perspective on this would be amazing and so sorry this is so long winded!!",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7442001}"

I came down with a nasty cold the last two days which started as a headache a few days ago. Yesterday, my nose started running, itchy throat and ears, and watery eyes. Negative covid test.

Overall, though, I don't really crave kratom. I've definitely noticed some lethargy and mood swings. Yesterday, while exercising, I got super emotional out of nowhere, and I sat in my garage on the verge of tears and wasn't really sure why. 

Beyond that, I feel much, much better. I generally sleep 7ish hours, or more, without any sleep aid now. This is the first time in 10 or more years that I've been able to just lay down and go to bed without some sort of sleep aid. I do wake up a few times at night, I have very vivid (and often disturbing) dreams, but I wake up with energy again, finally.

For years I drowned myself in booze to stop nightmares related to my service in the military. Once I quit booze, I moved right to kratom. For a while, it worked great. Until it didn't, and I kept making excuses. The bottom line is, I might have horrible nightmares the rest of my life. That doesn't mean I should numb myself all fucking day with something as an excuse. I'm used to it. Even with kratom, they'd come back. At least now when I wake up I can quickly rationalize what's happening and I don't need to scarf down 2am tea to get back to sleep.

The quitting phase, in general, wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be. I stayed extremely busy and exercised like a maniac so I was tired as hell at night. I didn't sleep great at first obviously, but I did sleep.

Work is far more tolerable. I fucking despise working in a cubicle. I spent a decade, into my late 20s, doing crazy stuff, and it's hard to reconcile that with making computers do stuff. I'm grateful to have stable employment, but I'm starting to realize being unfulfilled is a source of my addiction predilection, not a symptom.  Quitting kratom and having a clear mind has really given me the mental space to work through a lot of this - stuff I used to just numb with green sludge.

Anyway, if you're thinking about quitting, don't be scared of it. Face it head on. Have courage to stare it down and make it into something you can fight and beat, because you can.

I’m back on day 4 and not doing too bad (had a fairly short relapse of 1.5 weeks). I was curious if anyone else in this sub has been able to pinpoint the source of the electric-feeling chills that run through the body during withdrawal... for me I can trigger them by massaging the area between the back of my head and back of neck. 

I wonder if that is where opioids accumulate in the brain during use. It’s odd; I make sure to hit this area with warm water when I’m in the shower and withdrawing. I’m hoping the chills subside soon.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.62079823}"

My progress was slow, but it was progress.  I still had some issues sleeping which really screwed with me, but I was generally feeling overall better, significantly better in fact.  Then, I made the mistake I always make... I told myself I'd do it one weekend.  That turned into ""oh well, I will do 1 or 2 weeks, that's fine.""

I quickly reached about 1 month of daily use and tried to quit.  I made it almost 48 hours and redosed.  I had a really good night and woke up in the morning in a sweat and panic.  My heart started racing when I woke up and I was sort of freaking out.  My body had super high cravings and I gave in.

A few weeks ago I tried to quit again and I made it through one night but redosed again the next day.  I keep kicking myself that I didn't give it up sooner when WD would not be as bad.

I've keep thinking of quitting all the time.  Basically, I do my job, come home, dose, eat and then feel OK or sometimes good for an hour or 2, then I feel sort of shitty for the next 24 hours until I dose again.  Once the high wears off, you just feel sort of agitated and annoyed.  You don't want to do much but sort of stare at a TV.  I was taking about 30-40gpd of various strains.  I would just rotate.

I found that it made me completely unlike myself.  I didn't laugh a lot, stress felt x5 more stressful than it should, sleeping got worse and I generally didn't feel emotions.  I was barely listening to music, something I love.  I didn't play computer games or anything.  I became really a shell of myself.  I worked, took kratom, ate and slept (poorly.)  That was my existence and it sucked.

I decided on Friday I would finally quit.  I knew I needed to force myself into a situation where I could not redose.  So, I threw away all my kratom on Thursday.  I cleaned up my apartment to make the next few days as relaxing as possible.  Around 1:30p on Friday, I officially entered my withdrawal phase, which typically starts 24+ hours after the last dose.

I was napping when withdrawals started kicking in.  I went to bed sober and just tossed and turned.  I had so many bizarre and stressful dreams.  I remember that I kept realizing I was in a dream.  It would be a scenario where everyone is after me or my life or the world is ending and then I'd realize it was a dream and woke up breathing heavily.  

I woke up and got in front of the TV and started just watching to help pass the time.  I watched the new WandaVision episodes, which were great.  Around the 30 hour mark physical symptoms started kicking in.  I got really cold at first.  Then the sniffles kicked in with lots of yawning.  The hardcore desire to redose subsided, but I just started feeling kinda bad.  My arms felt heavy and things started aching, but it felt good because kratom had been causing me to sleep poorly and in bad positions, causing some of these aches.  It was like I using them again.

I spent most of the night watching TV and movies just to pass the time.  I smoked vaped some Marijuana (I live in a legal state) and took some edibles.  When they kicked it, it really helped with some of the pain and dullness of the moment.  Around the 36-38 hour mark the edible really took hold and I was super tired.  I got in bed and could not keep my eyes opened.  I fell asleep, but it felt more like my body just had to shut down and repair.  The sleep was not great.  I rolled and tossed throughout most of the night, but got about 6-8 hours of this sleep.  I woke up around 8a and took a shower, caught up on social media and then laid back in bed.  I still felt sort of tired, but it felt more like the edibles wearing off since they were so strong.  Around 10a, I fell back asleep.  I woke up 3 hours later just after 1p.  That sleep felt way more refreshing.

So, here I am now... about 48 hours later since my last dose and about 24 hours into withdrawal symptoms.  Right now, I am yawning a lot.  I get chills followed by moments of euphoria where I feel really good.  That lasts like as second, but they are nice.  Its like a whiff of freedom and peace.  Its a good reminder you are capable of getting back to normal.  I feel like I've awoken again.  I feel like there are 2 versions of me ""kratom me"" and ""normal me.""  Kratom me was trapped in the addiction and was not himself.  

Right now, I feel like I can feel again.  My interest in things and music has already returned.  I am already reacting to things differently.  Strangely, you start smelling things again too.  I do have a lot of creeping anxiety.  It's like my mind is gnawing at me.  It knows what's coming, but I am hoping it's not as bad.  I really hope for the next 3 weeks I am not in hell.  I am hoping it's nowhere near some of the past times I've withdrawn.  They can be nightmares.

I am going to give it a shot.  I have to.  I need to find something that keeps me from always ending back up here.  It's not worth it, not at all.",39,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.510944}"

Used on/off for nearly 3 years with 1.5 years of continued usage until now. The only times I have quit is when I went back to prescription opiods (which I stopped completely the summer of 2019, when my unbroken use of kratom started after).  Have been using this stuff to feel numb and cope with many life events that have happened over the last few years, looking forward to meeting myself again.

I know what to expect from other opiod withdraws, but I am trying to keep my expectations low and go with the flow of what happens. I am down to around 8 gpd and it honestly feels like an annoyance at this point.

I have read many inspiring stories on this sub and have taken much of it into account as giving me the motivation to stop. Never been to rehab or meeting, but I would love to go to them. I love hearing about other's stories. I still have to work, school etc and do all my normal adult shit living alone on top of it, but like other people have said here, there is never a good time to stop.

Forgive me if I have done something out of place on here. I havent ever made a post before, and I just made an account after lurking, I just wanted to make an affirmation that I will hold myself to this.

Reasons I want to stop:

Bring back my personality

Be able to workout without needing a substance

Level out my hormones

Get rid of this kratom anxiety

Enjoy life the way its meant to be felt

Tired of being a fake ass boring lifeless zombie

&#x200B;

Bring on the feels

24HR Edit: Stepping back to reality feels like a drug in itself with minor side effects. I have the lite version of the classic withdraw symptoms. I slept 4.5 hours last night, woke up twice, had a dream of a dude getting his head blown off that woke me up (wtf lol). I have some shivers, watery eyes, yawning, lack of motivation (still able to do things just gotta yell at myself a little more), walked an hour while listening to music, hunger comes and goes. 

This feels extremely doable as of now. I am gonna keep my expectations low. I don't want to eat my words. I know a large part will be combating the insomnia.

Supplements/meds/minerals on standby for use: Aswanganda (adaptogens ftw, for anxiety, hormone functions) , clonidine (just for sleep), vitamin d3 (taking because I don't get sunlight), melatonin (probably not gonna take bc RLS), magnesium (for sleep and muscle achs/spasms), Moringa Tea with tumeric and Ashwanganda in it (help with the body, anxiety, hormones), x4 amino acid pills a day (rebuild ma brain) and Pepto (my bowls hit the emergency exit at times). I also have a gallon jug of water daily. 

A huge part of staying off this is going to be not having a crutch to lean on and take everyday. I am attempting to fill this void with tea, coffee, exercise, supplements, socializing and activities. I'm trying to keep my head on straight and stay grounded while retraining this monkey brain.

About 2 weeks before Christmas I took my normal dose before bed and about an hour later I had a full blown panic attack. I though I was having a stroke or a heart attack so I made my girlfriend rush me to the hospital. They did an ekg, chest X-ray and blood work which looked normal so they told me I had a panic attack. I wasn’t sure if it was the kratom until the next morning when I took my morning dose of a different strain and the same thing happened. I decided right then and there I was quitting kratom. I can’t put into words how terrible these panic attacks were. After a full day without dosing, the normal withdrawals started showing, and then I had another panic attack. At this point I thought I was going insane. To make a long story short, I came to the conclusion that the kratom was causing these panic attacks when I took it and when I didn’t. I felt trapped. I started rapidly reducing my dose by half about every 5 days. I still got panic attacks when dosing sometimes but as long as I continued to lower my doses they seemed to less frequent. I switched strains and vendors to try to eliminate a bad batch or strain but it did not make a difference. The attacks would start with a warm pins and needles feeling in my limbs, then I would get a loud ringing noise in my ear and my heart would race uncontrollably.  I’ve tapered my way down to a half a teaspoon 2x day and I feel I get no benefit from it so I jumped last night. I detoxed from heroin about 5 years ago and it was hell compared to this physically but kratom withdrawal is mentally taxing. I have a constant ringing in my ears that comes and goes. A light headed anxious feeling I’ve never felt and zero motivation. These panic attacks are godsend in way because they forced me to taper and quit.

2021-01-16 16:17:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/kyrned/in_defence_of_pain/,In Defence of Pain,"I do not write this to belittle anyone's experience with difficult pain either physical or emotional. And I do not believe that one must succumb to whatever life gives them. And I think it is a positive thing that medicine and technology have helped us understand ways that we can make people whose lives are filled with pain a little bit better. But I do believe that many of us have come to realize that we were turning off a switch in our lives that we regret not having left on. 

Kratom turned off the pain.

I started taking it to battle pain in my shoulder from an old injury. It worked. But really? I kept taking it to battle pain in my soul that I don't know that I was completely aware of. But kratom turned that off too.

Many of us stop because we come to realize that the negatives have begun to outweigh the positives but at this point? I am beginning to question some of the things that I considered were positive in the first place.

Today I saw myself in the mirror. And I looked as healthy as I have in over a year. After a moment of joy I was surprised by a moment of anger and regret. One of the reasons it surprised me is aside from the strange irrational rages that kratom gave me I haven't felt what I would think is true regret or some kind of righteous anger like I did in that moment for a very long time. These were almost foreign feelings. But they were also like old friends that came back for a visit after being gone for over a year.

I felt anger and regret in that moment when I realized that I had allowed myself to turn off a year of my life and more, for me, my family, my children, my work.

And then this hit me like a ton of bricks:

Not only had I robbed myself of an appetite, orgasms, purpose, joy, etc. 

But I had robbed myself of pain.

And in doing so had missed the opportunity to forgive myself for the shortcomings in my life and to make a plan and hopefully execute it to improve them. I had robbed from myself the joy that comes from overcoming pain. I had robbed from myself the importance of knowing that one of my teeth is split.

And then I had an emotion that I had also turned off with the kratom. Overwhelming thankfulness. Thankfulness for the pain, thankfulness for being alive.

Thankfulness for another chance.

Kratom certainly trained me to ignore pain. It reinforced the idea that pain is my enemy. And gave me a way to avoid it to some extent. But in another way this experience has also taught me that I didn't understand pain before kratom. So if there is a silver lining it is that I have come to cherish all of it now. 

Not just the things that make me happy but the pain as well. Wise old men and women have said it well. ""Bad weather is better than no weather"". Kratom was basically no weather.

Here's to pain.

That drug had me trapped, couldn’t get away from it. It wasn’t that Kratom was making me do bad things -  I was fairly pleasant while on it except for the occasional short temper. And usually even put me in a good mood, but I just couldn’t gain traction and make progress in my life. Anytime a I completed a difficult task, hey how about some Kratom? Anytime I had a reason to celebrate, hey how about some Kratom? Anytime I had to face difficult feelings or a challenging situation, hey how about some Kratom?

And the Kratom wasn’t into some bumbling fool like alcohol, but it just took away any drive that I had. Add to that that feeling, that itchy feeling of needing something, of waking up in the morning and knowing that you don’t feel great because you need a little spoonful, and that spoonful gotnastier and nastier every day. But I needed it.  So I would choke it down and feel better, but also worse.

I really turned the corner after a week or so.  No more anxiety, no more negative thinking.  I am also in recovery from alcohol addiction and regular personal counseling and it was SUPER HELPFUL to be able to talk to someone honestly about it.  I know that’s not option for everyone, but if it is, consider it!

Yesterday I took 9 grams over three doses. Today I feel mostly great. I've started the wim hof 30 day challenge did breathing exercises and cold shower this morning and at lunch , the evening I'm about to start.. more or less I feel better than I thought I would. I quit kratom about a year ago was up to 100 g per day tapered down pretty quickly within 2 weeks and quit for about a month. Then got back on. But my wds were soo much worse a year ago.

My intention is recovery, of myself, my highest good, and to live a life of meaning and purpose.

I intend to learn all wim hof techniques and to live each moment in purpose. I've lived a hard life .  We are going to keep what we have by keeping it away and I think I can see my life heading towards an altruistic purpose. Kratom was a godsend in the beginning. But it took over . For me building a meaningful life is what I want. I'm very aware of the losses over the past 4 years.

2021-01-15 18:52:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/ky761h/one_year_off_kratom_today/,One Year Off Kratom Today.,"When I first quit last year, I didn’t read posts like these. I didn’t relate to them; I’d much rather hear about someone going through withdrawals, fighting through the first week. It seemed much more attainable. People who’d been clean a year were a different breed. 

Now that I’m here, I can say with confidence that one year isn’t some magical, unattainable goal. It takes work, it takes struggle — but it’s real. 

People like me, who used to take extracts all the time, who couldn’t hang out with his girlfriend unless he choked down ten capsules first, who wasted thousands of dollars — get to this point.

I still remember driving home on the 1/15/20, crying in my car after having a breakdown at work, suddenly feeling this overwhelming need to get rid of Kratom.

I remember getting home and posting on here, not really believing I’d follow through with it. 

The responses I got were positive, though. And the next day, the desire to quit didn’t go away. So before I could stop myself, I hunted down every last capsule I could find and drove them to a dumpster. I remember getting the urge to make a detour to the headshop, but resisting. I drove back home and forced myself to eat in the middle of the day, for the first time in a year.

The first few weeks after that were euphoric. I was basking in my newfound emotions. 

There were struggles that came with these new emotions. I told my girlfriend I didn’t want to move in together anymore, which we’d been planning on. That put a permanent wound in our relationship.

I told her I’d been hiding an addiction from her. There were many tears and hard nights.

But little by little, I was getting better. I was making life decisions with a mind not flooded by artificial dopamine. There were periods of intense craving; I almost caved in July, August, and September. I drank much more than I should have. 

But now I’m here. Where I was doesn’t feel like that long ago. If one week is in your sights, so is one year. And more after that. There’s new life to be experienced every day after you leave kratom behind. 

Thanks to this community for existing. Sometimes all it takes is a quick scroll through to remember why you quit, and to remember that there are other people out there taking the same journey.

2021-01-15 16:57:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/ky4xhb/101_days_sober/,101 days sober,"Hi!

I was a 35gpd user for 2+ years. Opiates in general a total of 8 years. Kratom was supposed to help with suboxone withdrawals but quickly became my newest Master. I have tried to quit and relapsed by day 7 so many times I lost count. 

But I never took it as a failure and I never gave up!

Why was this time different for me? 
How did I make it this far after almost a decade of opiate addiction? 

I think there are many factors involved in the progress I have made thus far in my recovery.  Everyone is different. But here is what I believe has changed the game for me personally. 

1. I QUIT EVERYTHING (with exception of sugar): This was extremely difficult as during all of my previous ""failed"" attempts  I was trying DESPERATELY to find some sort of magical cure, or anything to help numb out effects of withdrawal. For me this mainly looked like giving up THC as it was previously justified in my mind as helping me, but as I let it go I realized I was now truly helping my brain heal by not constantly interrupting it's normal processes by trying not to feel.

With that being said...

2. I EMBRACED MY PAIN: The pain of withdrawals yes, but most importantly, the hidden layers of psychological/emotional pain that acted as the fuel for my addiction. Addiction begins as an attempt to NOT FEEL something, to FEEL DIFFERENT or BETTER than we did. There is something I was trying to drown out, and I needed to FEEL IT TO HEAL IT. 

This is very difficult to do alone. I don't want to say it's impossible, but for me I am getting through this process with the support of a emotionally intelligent spouse who creates a safe space for me to work through all of my repressed ""ugliness"". If you can, get therapy! Do shadow work, inner child work, open yourself up to healing on more than a physical dimension.

3. I FOUND A REASON TO QUIT: This one was tough.. I had such an amazingly supportive partner, but I kept relapsing and hiding it over and over.. I was choosing a high over unconditional connection. Deep down I yearned to start my own family and to raise my children in a home much more accepting, supportive and safe than the one I came from, but I needed to make a choice. I would have left this dream on the tbd back burner if my partner never stood up to me. But he did. It hurt him to see me hurt myself and he said he could not watch it much longer. And then I realized how my actions were keeping what I truly desired at a distance as I repeatedly choose to self sabotage. 

A couple months into my recovery, my REASON to quit grew as an old interest expanded into a passion and a potential  career path, something I never once could have imagined myself striving toward during active addiction when I was lost with no sense of purpose. 

What is your reason for quitting? It has to be something for you! Deep inside you want something for yourself, you need to put as much effort and attention on that as you have your addiction. This will take time to cultivate because shifting ones attention from substance abuse to a new personal values/goals is like stopping a heavy iron wheel from spinning 150mph and making it turn the opposite direction until it is spinning just as fast! 

Nothing about this is easy.

It will be so overwhelmingly difficult at times... But God damnit, IT IS SO WORTH IT... 
If you are willing and able to create within yourself, a space of willingness to endure the PAIN and UNCERTAINTY of recovery, you will most certainly find your way out of the darkest.

It is always darkest just before the dawn!!

I started when I quit drinking almost 2 years ago, and it got to the point where I had a daily habit. At my highest point I was probably at 35g’s a day. After NYE this year, I did a rapid taper over a week, then I ran out and thought I’d try and see how I felt since I had been on Bupropion  for 2 months steadily. And sure enough, I was steady coming off without any of the problems I had before. Maybe a touch of rls,  some anxiety, wacky sleep schedule (but I can actually get some sleep this time) and fatigue but relatively painless. Most importantly, the super intense mood swings Ive had over the last year seem to have stopped. They were def directly tied to the kratom use and they were fuckin up my life good. Very relieved to feel stable again. Anyway, here’s my daily routine if you’re interested. 
300mgs Bupropion 
0.1 Clonidine once a day, or maybe twice if I’m having prolonged anxiety
300mgs Magnesium x3
400mgs Ashwaganda x 2 or 3
Maybe a lil bit of weed at night
Also wrapping my legs with sheets and blankets seemed to work on the couple times I had RLS",5,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.4691982}"

I’m starting to get these weird bald spots in my beard, and wonder if it’s related to the Kratom.

I’m 27/m and so sick of being a slave to this shit. It no longer feels manageable, and I get bad withdrawals whenever I quit.

I start a new job Monday, and just figured I’ll cold turkey until then. I’m such an idiot because I had so much time off work in between jobs, and didn’t use the opportunity to get clean. The extreme fatigue and lack of motivation/depression was always just too overwhelming. I took a few grams when I felt fatigued and always felt better. I’d then workout a lot usually.

Here Are Things I’ve Noticed One Week After Quitting (75gpd 5 years),"1. The withdrawals really weren’t/aren’t as bad as expected. Sure I have lethargy and headaches and pains and insomnia but IT IS ALL MANAGEABLE. YOU. ARE. STRONG. 

2. Sex is INCREDIBLE. It is embarrassing how good it feels because, well, I can’t last as long because I’m no longer numbed up. But holy cow is it worth it (and the girlfriend is very understanding or the situation). 

3. You don’t understand the gratification that comes from being able to do even some of the same day-to-day tasks without needing substance. Sure I’m not 100% yet but man I just cooked myself some dinner for the first time (instead of ordering our) and I’m proud of myself. I took a shower and I’m proud of myself. I am going to work through all of this AND I’M PROUD OF MYSELF.

4. Music sounds SO much better. I have so much more of a connection to music now and it is just, in general, a much more pleasurable experience. You really don’t notice how numb you’ve become. Music has helped me immensely through all of this. Sad music, happy music, doesn’t matter it’s all great!

5. Sleep. Now I’m not saying I’m back to 100% and I do still suffer from insomnia but last night I got a full 8 hours in (I know crazy. Before that I was getting 3 hours a night and drove my girlfriend CRAZY!) and I woke up and almost cried. It truly makes you realize how important sleep is and also how STRONG you are for being able to still get out of bed and get through the day running on a few hours. 

6. Do I have extra money laying around now because I’m not spending money on kratom? Sure do! Having some extra money around to pay my bills and treat myself and my girlfriend is wonderful. I no longer have to factor kratom into my budget!

7. You just feel more of a sense of self. I was so worried I would be different when I quit and for a few days (withdrawals will obviously alter your behavior duh it’s not permanent though) I was a bit mopey but now I’m walking around work smiling and joking again and I don’t have to think to myself “Is it the kratom that’s making me this person everyone likes, or am I really a person that people like?”. You can be the person you want to be regardless of kratom. You can feel good without it. You can live without it and you will feel more in-tune with yourself and your emotions.",36,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.8473622}"

Feel a lot of mental fog.  Don’t feel terrible but feels like gravity is stronger and everything seems in slow motion yet day is moving along.. soon it will be dark and if I resist a bit longer Day 1 will be complete.  To me that’s always the hardest.

All other attempts to quit is that for me kratom just isn’t ok occasionally.  Each time I fail to stay quit it’s same thought that just once is ok yet that ALWAYS leads back to daily use !

Then it’s back to taper limbo.  Never really letting it get back to 30+ gpd, never suffering THAT much... but it just goes on n on.

I think that I took about 6g all of yesterday and that's down from probably 80-120 every day before that for months.
This morning I took 4g and the day off of work which I found to actually be counter productive right now. I think I would have only taken 2g if I'd been kept distracted. Tomorrow I'm taking on a 10 hour shift instead. I have some 00 capsules which I'll take 2 at a time just to keep my head above water. That means only if I really start to feel sick. 
Otherwise, I feel just fine. Baby is feeling just fine as well. I know we're gonna make it through and she's gonna be healthy at birth and so will I. 
It's not the ideal way to look at things but I'm thinking pregnant women have gone through much worse and still went on to give life to perfect children. I'm taking my vitamins, I'm a strong breeder my 3 year old son is an ox. I messed up but it's not gonna ruin our lives because I won't let it. 
We've had anatomy scans and everything looks perfect. I have to believe it is. I'm just going to keep taking the next step in the right direction.
Tonight I'll take another 2g, my Seroquel and call it another early night so I make it to and through tomorrow. 
Keep us in your prayers.

I don't even know how many tames I did it before, but started using the green slush almost five years ago. Dose went up rapidly, and with tolerance breaks in between I went through this shitstorm quite a few times.

I also combined it with phenibut as many do, and weed. At first this combination was total bliss and I had some great times, but when ketamine came into the picture for a while, it made me end up in a clinic somewhere far away last year.

After getting out of the clinic and doing 12-steps program and NA, I was sober for a while, but soooo depressed. Was put on wellbutrin, but that didn't do shit for me, the craving came back because of my shitty life situation.

So I ordered a few pounds of K and got at it again. It made me do the thing I needed again, but I went back to 60 gr a day and kept doing this for three months. This is about the time I took a tolerance break in the past, but this time I'm not going back to it.

The past week was a real mess, all the expected symptoms were there, what a horrific WD. Now I'm left dazed and confused and definately not there yet.

I'm broke and couch surfingright now and went clearing up some of the piles of trash I left bc of years of active addiction and this was so painful. I went through all kinds of memories of a great life I had once and nothing is left of it. It's really hard to see light at the end of the tunnel, especially with all the shit going on in the world atm.

But hey, that's life I guess. Ups and downs. I've been lurking here for years and it has helped me before and does now too. So thank you all for your shares, it's so helpful too know I'm not the only one going through this.

2021-01-14 15:10:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/kxdn3l/the_hidden_benefits_of_tapering_and_one_negative/,The hidden benefits of tapering (and one negative),"We all have our best way.  And this is not for you cold turkey iron men and women, but for us taperers, or those on the fence.

The main pluses and minuses of tapering are clear.  You can read about them in the guide.  But it is a way to lessen the pain of quitting and allow for a more gentle transition into health, while allowing us to continue to work and care for family as well.

But I noticed a couple things that sort of surprised me:

\+First of all I followed the recommendation of the guide to do more frequent smaller doses to keep the level even, and not have highs and lows.  Well this has the effect of making kratom mean much less from the very beginning.  I stopped getting a ""feeling"" from it fairly early into the taper.  Then I spent the next 2.5 months not taking it for the feeling anymore, but just to mitigate withdrawals.  So in a way i was already quitting.  I was learning to live sober even before i was completely sober.

\+Not only do you spread your negative effects over a longer period making them less painful, but you spread the POSITIVE changes back into the taper as well.  Initially I thought of the quit as when the real good stuff happens.  But you really get to see the changes to your system come in over the taper as well.  All those things people talk about for the quit.  Sex drive, appetite, interest in life, etc.  Those things begin to come back before you reach the ultimate goal.

\+For me the thought of relapsing was something I was dealing with for the whole three months of my taper.  I had a few slips.  And I learned the lessons from them that are similar to a relapse.  When it came time to quit I have had very little craving.  Because I have reinforced the idea of how incredibly negative kratom is for me for an entire 3 months.  The need to quell the pain is less, and the appeal of it is also less as well.  The idea of ""I deserve one little dose as a reward""?  Really pales next to the work I have put in.

\-One thing I noticed that is something to be aware of on the negative side.  If you Cold Turkey you are taking the most efficient path to sobriety. You will feel every last bit of withdrawal, but ONLY what is necessary.  But when you taper, you can draw out the drops beyond what would be necessary.  Maybe even delay your final jump off out of fear etc.  So you might be feeling your withdrawals less strongly, but you may be feeling that for longer than you need.. staying on kratom longer than needed.  Just something to be mindful of.

Anyway... I think tapering is a great way to quit this garbage if you can choose to do that.  And I wish everyone luck!",16,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5212828}"

I haven't been on here in awhile. I am about 97 days off Kratom cold turkey, but having major urges to go to the store tonight and get some. Basically, I'll be honest.  I'm dying to lose weight. I had to take 2 months off from exercising due to having surgery not once, but twice.  All I want is to get this weight off (as of today I gained 14 lbs since September).  I struggle with addiction and not being able to exercise, trapped in my house all this time, working from home, and dealing with stress along with the holidays - I gained weight.  

I have been making lists about all the horrible reasons I do not want to go back on Kratom and the toxic sludge that it is, but yet I know I'll be super skinny fast if I do.  I was able to go for a run today for the first time in over 8 weeks finally.  I am pretty sure I can lose weight without it now that I can exercise again, but I just want to get it off as fast as possible. 

I am having a hard time even posting this as it seems so ridiculous to admit, but I wanted to at least post this and give myself some time to pause and try and deter myself from resuming this habit.

Started taking kratom a year and a half ago. I was looking for an alternative to painkillers as I had already gone down that road and wound up on suboxone. That was a nightmare. Was told the same thing a lot of us heard: it's a member of the coffee family and it's no worse than that. Long story short I was taking 30-50 GPD and realized that I would experience withdrawal if I stopped taking it. Tried to taper but it wasn't working so I contacted my doctor and got on a short sub taper (told him I would not go on it long term), clonidine, and gabapentin. I also stocked up on various supplements. I took the suboxone for a week and then quit for 5 days. I was still experiencing symptoms so I took small doses after that for probably 2 weeks. First day I was fine. By the evening of the second day I was experiencing withdrawal but I could get sleep. Woke up feeling pretty good but it didn't last. That afternoon and evening were murder. During the times I felt good I made sure to walk at least a couple of miles. I was able to get some sleep that night as well though. Yesterday was crappy and I was not able to sleep last night despite the clonidine, gabapentin, magnesium and CBD I took. Of course this is the day I have to go back to work and now I'm exhausted. During this time I also have developed gallbladder issues which is why I took a week off work last week.  Took all my daytime energy supplements around two hours ago and now I feel like I need to go to sleep but I have to be at work in half an hour.  I'm not sure if it's kratom withdrawal now since it's been a little over 3 weeks or if I'm now in sub withdrawal which I was hoping to avoid. It's weird because it's not as bad as it was when I went through sub withdrawal before but I would think that after 3 weeks the kratom withdrawal would be over. I feel in a pretty good mood considering no sleep last night but I have no energy and I'm concerned about going to work. Going to give it my best shot I guess. What other choice is there? Just needed to vent and share my story as I've been lurking on here for a bit.

Total sobriety is hard. I picked up daily kratom use in October after my cat suddenly died and my work schedule became temporarily overbearing. I had used kratom sporadically in the past and thought, “fuck it, it’s not alcohol”, and began to use every morning to get me out of bed and throughout the day to “keep me going”

Eventually, I started experiencing awful side effects. Mood swings that made me feel insane, eyes shaking back and forth, I didn’t even realize that the reason I was shitting my brains out every morning was because I was in kratom withdrawal every morning before my first dose! Skin problems, dry mouth, vomiting, it became all side effects and no euphoria. 

My dosage probably never exceeded around 25gpd, but I am certainly feeling the withdrawals. I have felt mostly awful throughout my usage, and have decided to put this junk down for good. I did NOT get sober from alcohol just to jump into another addiction. I want to truly recover, I was doing pretty well before I picked up this awful habit. 

So, here I am. Day two. Yesterday I took a bath and two showers, walked on a treadmill for 45mins in full sweats, had a very fucky time sleeping with rls that seemed to radiate up my spine. God bless my heating pad. I spent the whole day reading on this sub, crying, accepting what I had done to myself. 

Today, experiencing the same symptoms to a lesser degree. This sub has helped immensely, thank you for sharing your experiences. Hoping I can be truly sober & at peace with myself one day.",41,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.74767005}"

I’m at day two right and now and I actually don’t feel bad at all. A little anxious I think mainly because of the fact I’m finally quitting Kratom and going to feel withdrawal effects I haven’t felt in 5 years. Back story. I was a Suboxone addict. I used them intravenously for about 3-5 years. Finally decided to quit and went to rehab. Worst experience of my life. The withdrawal wasn’t as bad as a dope kick as I’ve noticed. But it lasted much longer. My withdrawal from subs was a little over a month. And it was close to two months before I finally got good Sleep and felt normal again. Now I know this isn’t what’s going to happen with Kratom. It’s much short lived than that. But I’m looking for people’s experiences in the first 2-7 days. Even after if you’d like to share. As I said. I don’t feel bad at all. Little anxious. Last night I had a bit of a feeling of being hot and cold at the same time. But def not a withdrawal I was used too. So if you have an experience where you barley had symptoms I’d like to hear it. Or if yours was debilitating.

As many of you I started taking Kratom out of curiosity as I learned it would help with boosting my mood and energy wise.. I didn't particularly take in the info that said ""be wary if you have a dependency issue!"" which I have. I've been hooked on opiods for many years and come off my latest spell last year in March. 1 month later April 20 I decided to try Kratom. Needless to say I've been hooked since the first drink. Now almost 1 year later I gained 6kg and I'm super lazy and tired all the time.. Anyh I have tried to taper off and I went from a daily use of roughly 20gpd to roughly 6gpd.
I called in a drug and alcohol project I used to go to for an heroin addiction as I thought I could come off it by swapping it with Subutex and then taper that off??
I really wanted to ask you guys what you think about this idea?? The problem with me is I am not strong enough to flash it down the toilet myself and I will need professional help to support me.. Not sure if moving to another drug my help tho??

The last time was when I was a few weeks into a very successful taper.  I believe I was talking about how easy it had been.  Yeah.  Then one day, for some reason I can’t remember, I decided just to take one good dose just to enjoy the feeling one last time...I think on a Friday after work.  Actually, I found that when I got my dosage down quite a bit, the feeling was actually far better than the big doses I had gotten up to (12-18g).  Well, I suspect you know what happened.  That led to...”well maybe just indulge one more time before my morning workout so I can crush it”.  Then...”well I’ll just get back on track on Monday.”  I quickly ended up back where I started my taper.  Now, after a couple months, I started my taper again Sunday.  As usual, the initial cut sucked even though I knew from experience not to try to cut too much.  The worst part for me is waking up at 3 am after tossing and turning for a couple hours...so bad that I’m entangled in the covers.  I get what I think is rls, only all over my body and especially my arms.  

I’m 4 days in now and past the initial drop.  Like last time, I feel way better than when I was taking 70+gpd.  Now I’m armed with knowing that even slipping for a single dose leads to failure.  Im also not nearly as cocky as the first time...when I was wondering what all the talk about it being hard to taper was about.

Just examples.  But I hope what happened was I took an anti-nausea med. called ODT used with cancer patients. Because I was terribly nauseated and I hate to vomit more than anything. I hope what happened is that I had a reaction called dystonic.  We will see tonight. But I am dreading tonight because what if it wasn't a dystonic reaction?  Then I am faced with something that is unbearable to anyone. I took 20mgs of Librium didn't touch this pain. I took tylenol didn't touch this pain. I took 2 Benadryl didn't touch this pain. I was so doped up so sleepy but couldn't sleep because this leg pain was so excruciating it wouldn't let me lay still. I couldn't sit stand or lay for more than a second.  Anyway has anyone ever felt anything this bad or is it just me?  I have perpherial neuropathy maybe that is the reason. But things are not going well for first night. I can't believe Librium didn't touch it. Has anyone taken Librium or any Benzos for withdrawal side effects??? Well this is where I am. I slept most of the day.  This extreme leg pain only came at night last night and it lessened around 5am. It stopped around 7am.  Again how sensitive I am if I take in anything that has sugar in it I get severe leg pain but that is electric shocks. This was radiating pain up and down every fiber of my being.  What a trip this is.  
I will let you know how I am later or in the morning. If I get to get a little sleep. 
Do let me know if you have ever used Benzos for withdrawals??? Thank you I am hanging in there. No desire for kratom just want this nightmare to end.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8794276}"

- But fr anyone else in WDs feel like shit but be like “damn my partner can kinda get itttt right nowww” or is it just me?

“I swear to goddddd if I don’t sleep tonight”
- Y’all read my post for day 5? 😂😂 I’m like “bitchhhhh I slept 8 hours I’m gooood” then last night I slept at 12am and woke up at 3am so mad at the world bro lmao. I’m like these Reddit mfs jinxed me I’m done posting. 🙄

“I wonder what these other reddit kratom heads  doing?” 
- Fr tho knowing you guys are hating life too makes me feel better about my current situation.😂🤷🏽‍♂️

“Bro you can’t just shit every five minutes like there’s no reasonable humanly excuse to make up at this point..” 
- My girl doesn’t know I’m WDing. Yup I’m a mf champ. I’ll tell her eventually don’t ruin my vibe please lol. 

“I hope kratom didn’t make me like... slow now or something.”
- Nah I was quick with the shit talking on Xbox today. Dude said “Ima report you”. So yeah all is good in the cranium for sure lmao. 

“I swear to god music sounds better!” 
- Am I the only one who’s been really listening to the words and instruments and just overall greatness of music??

“I wonder what I’d be doing right now if I was on kratom....” 
- Throwing up, peeing, or being a cigarette wielding zombie in my car. No thanks.

*soon as I wake up* “Am I healed? Is it over?”
- Maybe. But if you’re reading this maybe not lmao. But hey, you’re one day better than the day before. And tomorrow will be better than today. So go have that diarrhea peeing outta your butt sesh and do something! Anything! You’re sober!

“I wonder if the other ex walking dead characters are gonna like my thoughts post?”
- Probably, cause you had em’ too.

Point - It’s okay to laugh about this. It’s okay to not FREAK THE FUCK OUT. Probably a billion people have had withdrawals from one thing or another over the span of mankind. Guess what? They lived. I will live. You will live. We did this, “embrace the suck”. 

You ever have a weird symptom, something small like a bad headache, you google it, and google tells you some crazy ass shit like “YOU HAVE A BRAIN TUMOR and you’re going to die.” Don’t go out of your way to read how baddddd some people had it. You most likely won’t have it that bad. Relax. Right now is DEFINITELY not the time to get your mind thinking a million negative thoughts. Just remind yourself. I’m going to feel like I’m sick. Then I’m going to feel better. Then normal. But the best part.... CLEAN AND NORMAL AND FUCKING FREEEEE.

“Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do.
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you.”

Good song. Anyways, here’s another way to look at it to calm your crazy ass mind rn. If you cheat on your partner 5 times, they find out, pack up and leave you, it suckssssss, you’re heart broken. But you deserved it. And you know that so after you quit crying and begging you’ll eventually feel better and move on. Been there, done that lol. 

Well we cheated on true REAL life EVERY SINGLE TIME we took that bullshit. A thousand times? More? But life ain’t packing up and leaving us. See that’s where we’re lucky right now. We’re not dead. We didn’t OD on maybe another drug like someone you probably know. Nope, life is still giving us a chance. How fucking lucky are we? Life is just smacking us around for a little while lol. But then it’ll take us back in it’s sweet, kind, REAL arms.

Life is gonna get better. Withdrawals will end. But for now, ride the wave. Write this down. You’ll look back one day and say “wow, that was an experience.”

started taking kratom for the pain and inflammation about 4 years ago got up to 70 to 100 g per day.
I've been working my way down to 6-8gpd for the past two weeks.
I went almost 24 hrs and wd was minimal. I've done this before once and wd were fucking terrible. I haven't seen anyone post about this but when I went through wd a year ago and my taper the past 3 weeks... my biggest symptom was being extremely emotional and crying a lot. Like a song comes on the radio fucking sobbing my eyes out. I dunno kinda wierd I thought. I'm also catching hell sleeping but other than that nothing too bad.

I need to plan my jump soon. Too long of a taper poses other problems. I have been meditating, found a therapist last week and am getting my support in place ahead of time. 

I did AA and NA for almost 6 years before.., but I don't agree with a few dogmas there so I'm building my support outside of 12 step. 
Curious about who on here has gotten clean, stayed clean and live happily without the 12step program?
where I'm at they brainwash you that it's literally the one and only way and any and every other way is nothing but a futile attempt.

But I read a great book called unbroken brain and learned about harm reduction and all these other programs that actually have better statistics. Anyway the last thing I want to start is conflict in here so please this is not an attempt to bash the 12-step as I think they are very helpful and help a lot of people and there's definitely more good than what I would call bad. I mostly curious to hear from people who cleaned up and are peaceful and happy. I know a lot of clean  sober  people who are miserable and I'll just go back to my substances if I'm going to be miserable.

Anyway I'll be in here a lot soon. I find this community helpful and get a lot out of reading your guys strength experience and hope..",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.38640687}"

I was a shell of myself, pale, dark circles, thinning brittle hair, acne that mimics a kid in puberty, I just look sad. 

Fast forward to 9 days CT and I’m finding the courage to look at myself again, to try and find out who the person looking back at me is without the cloud of kratom hovering above me. 

I’m not sure if I got lucky or not, but my physical symptoms were not and have not been horrendous. I think I’m holding my breath waiting for the unrelenting acute withdrawals to come, will they come later? Am I in the clear? It hasn’t been a cake walk by any means, my body seems unable to regulate temperature, I’m not sleeping great, my body feels restless, stomach cramping/diarrhea. I know that PAWS are coming and I’m scared, but ready.

Pain is only a lesson. When we learn about pain on the human level, we get frantic and show outward concern for just the moment. By removing ourselves and concentrating and reaching deep and having patience, we can rise above it. Pain is a teaching tool. Sometimes it is used to humble certain people. 

Now, some people, they bring the pain on because it's a shelter. They may use the pain as an excuse or as an ""out."" It varies with the individual. 

What is pain? It cannot touch you if you don't let it. If you admit that you will hurt, you're giving power to pain. DO not give it power. It's unnecessary to feel it. It's all connected to man. Reach into your spirit, your higher mind - it has no hold on you.

Waking up feeling depressed, anxious, unmotivated for no reason whatsoever when the day before was good.  It usually passes if I keep my mind and body occupied.

It was hard work to get up to that dosage. Nausea, sometimes I’d throw it all up, most times it just wasn’t enough, so I’d take more and my head would hurt and eyes would wobble. Until finally, I could just shovel that shit down with little to no affect. And I sure did. Nearly an 8 oz. bag every 2 days. Just incredibly irresponsible.

I can’t even count how many times I’ve gone through withdrawals besides that. Oxycodone, heroin, suboxone and kratom withdrawals.

I’m so tired of needing something just to get through the day and have to worry about who’s around and how I’m gonna take it every couple hours or so and having to worry about vacations and spending money and being distant from those I love. So anyways I went three days without any and then took a 7g dose once the fourth day then 2.5 grams the next day then 10 grams once a day for the next three days. Then I went 3 more days with nothing and I knew I still had a lot of free points at the local kratom shop. Enough to get quite a bit for free so I decided to go waste all my points and swallow 10 kratom pills and flush the rest but then something unexpected happened every time I put a pill in my mouth I couldn’t bring myself so swallow it. I was almost trying to tell myself it’s okay I can do it this last time but then every time I put a pill in my mouth and tried swallowing it I’d just hold it there for a minute and end up spitting it into the toilet with the rest of them. I ended up just throwing them all in there and flushing them. I was kind of sad to do it but I’m also proud of myself at the same time because I’ve never had the strength to do that before. An hour before this I had a conversation with my subconscious telling it it had to get on board with what I really wanted and I tried real hard in that moment to will it to be so. Our subconscious makes more decisions then we do without most of us even realizing it.

Im also terrified that when i run out of gabapentin the day after tomorrow im going to still be feeling the acute wd symptoms and im going to crack. When do these physical symptoms end?

Today I am finishing up anything I need to do so I can die tomorrow.  I am making a list of what I expect will get better after I am off Kratom.  I have been on it for 4 years for terrible pain. I know I will still have my pain because it is structural and nothing can be done for it except exercise.  I take 12grams a day of Red Borneo.  I have been on every strain. But now I know I have to stop it truly doesn't work anymore. I wish that meant that I wouldn't have withdrawals. But I know it doesn't.  I have been through narco withdrawals more times than I can count.  I am really nervous.  I am tired of hurting and I am tired of withdrawals.  I know from narco withdrawals for me the only way is c.t.  So I stop tonight when I go to bed.  I am an RN so I have everything for side effects from stopping if they happen. I made soup so I don't have to cook but get nurishment down. I have my drink that gives me all my nutrients. I have sprite and Pedialyte.  I have something for nausea, diarrhea and muscle aches and pains.  So what I need now only you guys can give me.  Faith, hope and kinda what to expect. I know we are all different but not really. I mean we all know narco withdrawals are death, well most of us.  So tell me kinda what to expect.  I have already been tearful because I am kinda scared to relive withdrawals again.  I am scared about my pain getting worse before it settles down to what I can endure.  Anyone who will help me through this with like step by step.  I read from someone a while ago that you should push yourself is that true.  Like even if you wanna stay in bed you should push to try and do something each day and exercise as soon as possible.  Anyway I truly would appreciate any insight into what is coming and how to deal with it psychologically.  I know emotions are usually worse than physical. I am a very sensitive person so I expect both to be bad.  But I want to believe it doesn't have to be a death sentence.  So help me out here.  Thanks so much for anything.

Just been reading through the testimonials. So when I turned 21 years old I started purchasing kratom from my nearest supplier and was using for the first 2 months solely for working out (I know I’m a fucking idiot) I used about 5-8 grams a day and I felt great, I could skip a two to three days and have no withdrawals. Then I started a new job that was a bit more high stress and I started taking some before my shifts and it would help relieve my anxieties (always had a sense of social anxiety but kratom made it wayyyy worse). So at this point I was taking about 5-8 grams before work and 5-8 grams after work when I would go to the gym. This started a downward spiral to the point I’m at now, about two years later taking somewhere between 50-70 grams a day. I have been doing really well at just shoving my subconscious down and trying not to listen to that little voice that’s telling me I’m ruining my life and body. I’ve attempted to taper in the past but it’s just been really difficult for me, i started again yesterday at 40grams and I’m going to see where that takes me. Luckily for me I have the support of my family and friends, I’ve hid it for so long it feels good for it to be out in the open and have some accountability.

I felt obligated to make a post on my quit because of the immense mental support this forum gave me. It was so much easier being able to read other peoples experiences and know that each day you are healing.

My Story:

I started using kratom around June because my roommate shared some with me. I don't have an excuse for medical value it was strictly fun to get high. For the first month I only took it once a week because I knew it had addictive properties. The next month it turned into a few times a week, then half the week, and three months later I was taking it every day. Over the course of the next few months it went from taking a 8-10 grams in the evening to slowly taking kratom throughout the day. By November I was taking kratom all day everyday some days 10 gpd and other days 28 gpd. Overall I was probably taking in 16gpd avg but who really knows! That is the game that your mind plays on you. You start to lie to everyone and even lie to yourself about your addiction and how big the problem is.

About two months ago I woke up at 6am with RLS type symptoms and I could not figure out what was happening. Of course my mind goes right to ""kratom will fix this"". I pop a gram of kratom and am able to fall asleep immediately. When I wake up I have a haunting suspicion that kratom is the problem not the solution. I begin researching and come across kratom withdrawal; I am absolutely shocked. I realize that kratom has taken a hold of my life. I've traded my active lifestyle for a mellow existence satisfied by sitting on the couch all day. All the activities I used to enjoy are now only fun with kratom and the buzz is wearing off. Now I am taking kratom just to feel normal but I'm dehydrated af and feel like an old man. I decided that it is time to quit New Years week.

Taper/CT:

Day 1: 20gpd to 10gpd. I took 2 grams 5 times a day. It wasn't that bad but I could already feel the wd symptoms. Sweating all day, could not regulate my temperature either too hot or too cold. I also had low appetite and stomach issues. Overall I'd say 4/10 on the pain scale.

Day 2: 10gpd to 6 gpd. WD is starting to get rough. I try to prolong my kratom intake as long as I can. I finally break at 2pm and dose. I save a large dose for before bed because I figure it is better to get sleep then feel good during the day. The worst part is the RLS symptoms I cannot sit still and sleep is hard. 6/10

Day 3: 6gpd to 2gpd. At this point I'm really pissed that I fell into this trap. I say fuck it I'm going to go CT tomorrow. I take 1 gram in the early morning to continue sleeping and 1 gram right before bed so I can sleep. The RLS is really bad especially at night but taking a minimal amount of kratom allowed me to fall asleep. The other symptoms are flu like and are manageable. 8/10

Day 4: CT. This was the hardest day of kratom WD for me. During the day I was sweating it out watching TV but I did go for a hike which helped take my mind off wds. The worst part was the mental fatigue and waking up realizing I wasn't out of the woods yet. Oddly enough I felt more clear headed than I had in months. Physically this day was not any worse than day three but emotionally it was tough. 10/10

Day 5: I finally feel like I got a decent nights sleep but I am still exhausted from sleep deprivation the previous nights. I go for another hike which really boosts my mood. I no longer feel super sweaty but the restlessness is still bad at night. 6/10

Day 6: I sleep 8 hours but I am still mentally fatigued. I exercise again which helps immensely to pass time and improve mood. I have pockets of happiness but still feel somewhat depressed overall. The flu like symptoms are almost gone and the RLS seems to be much better. 4/10

Day 7: I slept 9 hours last night and I feel fucking great. I'm probably at 80% of my former self but compared to the last few days I feel so much better its incredible. I'll go for another hike today after work and eat healthy all day. I can still feel the anxiety/depression but the physical symptoms are very mild. 2/10

Advice: 

I'm not going to lie kratom wd sucks ass but it isn't the worst thing I have experienced in my life. I've had colds/flus that were worse than the physical symptoms. I've had traumatic experiences that were worse than the mental symptoms. The real challenge is that they hit you all at the same time. It's scary waking up feeling worse for the first few days when you told yourself you would feel better tomorrow. You just have to remember that things will get better and this forum was great for reminding me that. 

I know this is still just the beginning of my kratomless journey and I have a long way to go. If I start craving I'll sign up for AA/NA.

Tips:

I found that supplements help if not only for placebo effect. It gives you some temporary mind relief. I 100% felt that magnesium and a sleepy tea at night helped. 

Don't do it alone! It sucks admitting to friends/family that you have a problem but it really isn't that big of a deal. It's not like you committed a crime, you are suffering from a disease. Talking with someone was extremely therapeutic for me. It also helped to hold myself accountable.

Exercise as much as you can. It can feel sluggish but I always felt better after exercise. It also helped pass the time.

Take time of work to focus on recovery. I took a 4 day weekend to kick and am happy to be back at work today. I did the first two days at work and it wasn't that bad but days 3-6 would have been really tough. It would be stressful and I probably would have felt obligated to take kratom.

Hang out with people as much as you can. The worst moments so far were when I was alone.

Mornings are the hardest. Don't lie around in bed just wake up and take a shower if you cannot fall back asleep in 5 mins. Once you start moving you feel so much better.

RLS was probably my worst symptom especially around bedtime. If I couldn't fall asleep within 15 minutes I felt that it wasn't going to happen. I'd go do something for a half hour then try again. I think this is helpful because then you suffer less. If you lay in bed for an hour it will be hell, so if your body is not ready for sleep there is no point in lying there.

Also, sleep meditation youtube videos seemed helpful for falling asleep.

I began a slow taper last week. I was at 18-20 gpd for maybe 2 years and maybe 9gpd for a good 8 years before that. A long time habit! So last Tuesday I cut my dose down to 12gpd. I have been taking 9g in the evening and 3g a few hours later before bed. I’ve found cutting out my 2 3g daily doses quite easy actually! But I haven’t gotten a good night’s sleep since I’ve lowered my intake. Say, 3-ish hours per night. It’s not terrible, and the rls is not really present at this point but I cannot get back to sleep. I have gone through full fledged WD before (by accident, weird story) so I know how bad it can get by comparison. and although I’m committed to continue my taper I’m just a bit concerned that just a 25% reduction has affected my sleep this much. The ability to get decent sleep through the quitting process is the main reason for me tapering. I’ve read many people on here in my quick scrolling say that their bodies would get used to a taper amount after a few days, and then you can wash / repeat with lower and lower doses. Am I just impatient after (almost) a week? Do I need to accept my sleep will be a few hours per night and just keep plowing ahead? Or are there any changes I can make to help get more sleep throughout a taper? (I’ve been exercising, drinking herbal tea constantly, and taking ibuprofen before bed)

Read this.,"This is a long post, mainly for me to look back to one day. If you wanna go straight to the withdrawals, skip the next few paragraphs that contain background info. But if you wanna quit, which you obviously do, maybe it will be a good read for you. 

*****BACKGROUND -

Realistically I always knew I’d be addicted to one thing or another since I was a teen, as I always loved chasing “a buzz”. Now I’m 29. 5 years ago I got a norco habit after a wisdom tooth pull. Kicked that after a year. 3 days of a cute little withdrawal and I was 100% back to normal.

I was like shiiiiiit that ain’t bad lol so I picked up norcos again thinking I can stop whenever I want, then I remembered I wasn’t rich enough for that habit, wasn’t gonna ever get into heroin, so I started taking suboxone. Took subs for a year, decided I had to quit and I did. Again, a 4-5 day withdrawal and I was back to 100% normal. 

So again I was like shiiiiiit even that wasn’t bad. I’m literally thinking to myself “all these guys crying about withdrawals must be little Bs cause I get through it easily...”

Then I heard about kratom. It’s legal. Great euphoric buzz. And the guy at the smoke shop tells me in his weird ass accent that I could never figure out where he’s from “brooh, eets no withdrawal eets like from coffee eets okay”. Alright cool. Withdrawals as bad as coffee. Can’t be that bad. 

Started with the capsules, took them for about a month and then I started getting extreme stomach pain lasting 10 days. I lost 10 pounds literally. I couldn’t eat AT ALL and if I did it was THE WORST stomach pain I’ve ever felt by far. Landed myself in the ER. They didn’t even know what kratom was and they said “go see a specialist” when they found out I didn’t have insurance lmao. Horrible time in my life. Anyways it was because of the kratom capsules. I literally shit kratom out for A MONTH even though I wasn’t taking it. Smelled like and looked like kratom. It’s like my stomach never processed it. 

Red flag, but did I learn my lesson? Of course not because I, like you, am dumb af sometimes. It happens lol. Well I can’t digest the capsules, what about these liquid shots? Oooooh they don’t hurt my stomach. Great buzz. Well I’m hooked. Started with one every other day. Then once a day.... then almost 2 years later it was FIVE SHOTS a day. Soon as I open my eyes in the morning, first thing comes to mind, “shot of kratom”. My whole life revolves around the 2.5 hour intervals between taking kratom. My girl didn’t know. She couldn’t as she lost a brother to drugs. I hid it from EVERYONE. 

I own a business, I’d leave my store, just to go sit in my car and wait the 30 minutes after taking a shot to feel “the buzz” and smoke 15 cigarettes back to back. Thinking, “this is my happiness, I don’t care”.

Then the buzz stopped. 5 shots ($100 a day habit) suddenly wasn’t enough. Every shot I took, came with a vomit session. Headache throughout the day. Nauseous all day. Constantly thinking about my next shot. Feeling like shit if I can’t get to a shot in time. Obsessing with it. All that mattered was taking kratom. Is that a life? Is constantly obsessing over a crushed up Asian plant juice thing for years and years a life you want to live? I’ll be honest, that’s soooo lame. And I’m not talking shit to you reader, cause I was soooo lame for soooo long. 

It needed to end. I knew it. I couldn’t spend thousands of dollars a month anymore. (Business had been good thank god.) I could no longer pretend I had a weird “random throwing up problem” in front of my girl anymore. I couldn’t keep pretending I didn’t know why I pee so much. I couldn’t keep being someone I wasn’t 24/7. It was exhausting. It wasn’t right.  I was numb. Lost. Alone. Like you, reader.

So 2020 sucked huh? Lmao. My business got shut down. Delivered pizza TO AFFORD MY HABIT and not touch my savings. Embarrassing. Anddddd by the end of the year I knew I had to quit. And I realized something. YOU HAVE TO WANT TO QUIT in order to actually do it. I wrote out a list of why I needed to quit. A long, rambling, often incoherent list. And after I read the list I literally HATED kratom. 

(Pro tip- Write that list, sounds corny but it will really help during the “I just want this suffering to end” during withdrawals).





*****WITHDRAWAL - 

So I came up with a plan. Rapid suboxone taper. December 20th I took my last kratom shot. Next day started with 2mg of suboxone film in the AM, then 2mg in the evening. Every few days I’d go down .5 or even 1mg. This taper wasn’t bad at all actually. I did feel WD symptoms whenever I’d cut down to a lower dose. But considering it was Christmas time at my very busy businesses, it was completely manageable. Maybe a runny nose, a little back ache. But really, it wasn’t bad. Wouldn’t even realize it if I didn’t think about it. Two or three suboxone films is all I needed. Tapered, tapered, until I was down to only .5mg a day.

Wednesday, January 6th at 8am was my last dose of suboxone at .5mg. Thursday, January 7th at 8am was my first 24 hours clean.

Andddd the withdrawals began. “Eets like coffee” my ass. It’s not. It’s a full blown withdrawal. 

First day - Flu like symptoms. Sneezing. Runny nose. Very achy. Mood all over the place. Shortness of breath and no energy whatsoever. But honestly, not as bad as I thought reading the horror stories on here, and I attribute that to my suboxone taper because I kinda already had slight very small withdrawals for two weeks tapering. RLS bad at night. Anxiety really bad at night too. Had some clonidine and gabapentin (read a lot of posts that it’s REALLY helpful) care package sent to me from someone really Fing nice. But honestly, JUST FOR ME, they didn’t help much. Clonidine just intensified my already super tired feeling. Gabapentin didn’t feel like anything. Barely got any sleep but was SO HAPPY to be clean. 

Day two - better then day one. I always read the peak is between day 2-4. Never been the case for me. All three times I withdrawal always been first days the worst, then gradually better each day. Everyone is different I guess, I read some people don’t even feel the withdrawals till day 3 sometimes. Tired all day, still runny, RLS at night. Low energy. Night two was the worst as far as anxiety. Weed helped a little. 

Night two is when the “I still have suboxone literally in between my phone and phone case, I can’t suffer anymore, I’m snorting a piece of film F this!” Feeling came along. But something told me READ THAT LIST mentioned above. Reading half way thru the list of why I hate kratom, and I was like yeah go to sleep bitch. And I did. For an hour or two. Didn’t take the suboxone. Ironically enough as I’m writing this I have a film and a half of suboxone in between my fingers. I should throw them away. But nah, I’m not gonna. I’m embracing the suck. I’m literally telling myself, “you did this to yourself, pay for it.” And oddly enough it kind of amuses me, and makes it better. Weird. 

Day 3 - much better then the last two days. Same symptoms, but far less aggressive. Still tossing and turning at bed time. RLS is there but a little better. Low energy but also better. Basically all the symptoms of day 1, but significantly better. Slept a few more hours then the night before. At this day is when it started feeling weird yet normal to not have a every few hour drug routine.

Day 4 - Woke up and get this, for the first like 10 minutes I forgot I’m a drug addict currently withdrawing lmao. That was cool. Felt MUCH better in day 4. Much much better. Went out with my girl. Walked around. Much more energy. Still a little achy and stuffy, but mood is so much better. Just happy dude, seriously just felt like a real sense of HAPPINESS. Not a drug induced euphoric happiness. No, just a human emotion. Something I hadn’t felt in idk, years. Made the first 3 days totally worth it. Got a little anxiety at night, thinking too much. Also this shit w trump and the Capitol got me sad. I’m an immigrant and I love this country so that just made the anxiety worse. 

PRO TIP***** - chamomile tea, is a mf tranquilizer. Guess who slept 8 mf hours last night. This guyyyy. Only woke up once at 3am. Farted. And went back to sleep lmao. GET CHAMOMILE TEA!!!! Melatonin didn’t help the first 3 nights but chamomile tea worked like a charm. 

Day 5 - TODAY. What’s goodie? What’s up? What’s hannninnnn. I’m mf gooood. That’s right you drug addicts I’m gooood. I woke up in a good ass mood. Knees are okay. Back is okay. I sneezed and that made me stuffy but I think that’s because my girl doesn’t know I’m constantly freezing and decided to open the window at night. I’m not mad at her. Cause really, I’m a piece of shit and owe my life to this girl.

But yeahhhhhh dudes and dudettes. Day 5 for me was the game changer day. Listen everybody is different. I read some people who said it took until day 10 to feel happy. Some day 3. Me was day 5. 

But man. I’m clean. I’m good. I’m happy. Am I completely out of the woods? Only time will tell. Last 3 detoxes I didn’t suffer “PAWS”. Maybe this time will be different? I don’t know. And honestly I don’t care. Because at this very moment. At 9:08 at my apartment I’m sitting on my balcony, smoking a cigarette, looking at the ocean, and I am genuinely, truly, happy to be alive.

I want that for you, reader. When you quit, you will experience pain, anxiety, and some other bs. It may last a day, or a week, but IT WILL END.

IT WILL END.

Do it. EVERYBODYYYYY says the same thing - “I wish I quit earlier”. Realest shit ever. I wish I quit earlier. But it’s all good. Everyone makes mistakes. The girl at the McDonald’s drive thru forgot the extra pickles on my mf Big Mac last week. And I became a drug addict. She’s no better than I am.

Quit. Taper. Whatever. You are better than this.

So my tips are -

1. Write a list of why you need to quit whatever your drug is. Make it as detailed and disgustingly embarrassing as possible. Keep that list. Preferably in your phone.

2. Many many people say clonidine and gabapentin are very helpful. (Gaba can be addicting? So be careful). Personally I didn’t get much help from them but again they are supposed to be very helpful so it’s worth trying to get from your doctor. Just a weeks worth bitch don’t try to be slick lmao.

3. Ibuprofen for the aches are a life changer. Chamomile tea to sleep is VERY VERY helpful. Melatonin didn’t do much for me but maybe helped? Worth a try.

4. Keep reminding yourself that it will get better. It doesn’t stay this bad. Tomorrow will be better than today. Let’s be real, how long you been an addict? A year? Two? Five? You wasted all that time doing this BS being someone you WERENT BORN TO BE, and you’re telling me you can’t suffer for a few days/week. Grow up. And keep in mind, each detox gets harder. Each time you go through withdrawals it will be worse than the time before. Quit, and quit for good.

5. Last but not least. Stay strong. Post on here. TALK TO PEOPLE WHO ALREADY BEEN THROUGH THIS. Nothing better than hearing from someone who just felt exactly how you feel telling you “You’re gonna feel much better very soon”.

I truly, truly hope this post can help at least one person. Reddit is the reason I had the strength to do this. It will be more than worth it. I gotta journey ahead of me. But I’m gonna take it one day at a time. But as of right this second, I’m happy. Stay strong. I, and a lot of others, are here.... FOR YOU.

Sincerely,

I first started taking kratom in February of 2018 and eventually it turned into a daily thing then before I knew it I’ve gone a whole year and I couldn’t even remember the last time I went a single day without taking a dose and k ew I had a problem. So fast forward to a few weeks ago I started taking all the supplements recommended by the page I spent over 100$ in supplements lol. So I started taking those daily while still taking my kratom dose. I took my last dose of kratom on Thursday morning at 5am 1-05-21 and the only real “withdrawal “ I felt was trouble sleeping the first 2 nights but even then I still got at least 5 hours of sleep. Did I just get lucky or is the worst yet to come?,1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4609623}"

SELF-DISCIPLINE MYTH: First off, I’m NOT one of those mystical people who has a tremendous amount of self-discipline. I believe that’s a myth. Self-discipline is nothing more than a muscle. If you use it consistently and methodically it grows and becomes easier. 

GET A SCALE AND CONTAINERS: I picked up a bunch of those little salad dressing containers and a food scale. Every day I measure the EXACT amount of Kratom into the containers. 

SPACE AND TIME: I personally sought to space the timing of my doses every 2.5 hours (then shifted to 3) to maintain the amount of K in my system. WD’s would creep in at the 2 hour mark but I was able to hold on knowing I would dose in 2.5. 

LOG YOUR JOURNEY: I have logged in my daily update almost every day. Frankly I’m doing it for myself but I’m sure it’s helped someone. Doing so allows me to celebrate victories every day. The feeling of sitting here on day 29 is awesome! I was easily 40-50gpd (sometimes more?) and as of yesterday 15g. I’ve done a TON of work and I’m more than half way up the mountain. There’s no way I won’t make it.

SUPPLEMENTS: I’ve not taken much but know the taper guide here has a ton of advice. I have discovered that Modafinil really helps me. Not advising anyone else, just sharing my experience. 

MASTER THE MINDSET: beating this and winning the taper game is a mindset battle. The first few weeks were hard because I dosed often and whenever I felt like it. Beating that rhythm was tough. But now that I’ve had SO many victories momentum is on my side and it’s gotten much easier. I know there are more battles ahead but again, I have victories to draw upon!

Pre weigh out all your doses, it’s a mental thing.

Baby steps guys, baby steps. Anything great takes work, and with a slow taper you’re much more likely to succeed.

I’m down to 7g, previously at 30g a day. My personality is starting to come back.

Whatever you do, do not justify extra on a dose, it’s a recipe for a downward spiral disaster. 

If you’re above 15g a day start out with 3 seperate doses, then once down below 10 drop it to 2 doses a day.

Your paws will be minimal.

Start hittin the gym or exercising. Find new hobbies. Slowly fill those emotional gaps you’ve been using kratom for.

My partner of three years who I thought was going to be my wife left my suddenly for my best friend. I was devastated and Kratom was an incredible medicine that helped me through it big time, however, now that I'm finally over the breakup I am clear that I don't want to be using it 5-8 times per day, and honestly I don't want to be addicted to  it or anything at all.

I tried to wean off of it a few months ago and was down to using it only once per day. It was tough but I was on the verge of being done, however, I relapsed and since then I've resumed normal usage 5-8 times per day.

This might sound crazy to some but if anyone will get it, it would be this community! I've decided that I'm going to kick it cold pretty soon, any day now, but the withdrawals for me were brutal. I know that for some people they aren't so bad, but for me they were awful, so here's my plan and I'd love to get feedback and see if anyone has any idea if this will work or not. I've got a plan! Though it might not be well thought out.

Basically, because the withdrawals were so bad for me last time I decided a few substances could really help. On day one, by the time night time comes and I'm feeling terrible, I'm going to use a micro dose of pure molly I have. I did it once before and I noticed that while I was on it I had no cravings for Kratom and I also felt no W/D symptoms. Day two is where it get's a little crazy and I'm not sure if it will work or not, but I've acquired a one time dose of both pure morph\*%e and a 5mg dose of Oxyco\^%$n and my plan is this Day 1. Molly, Day 2. Morph, Day 3. Ox and from what I experienced last time, the first 48 hours were brutal, but then I started feeling better.

I know I know, why would I take a chance of using opiates in place of something so much milder. The truth is I know myself, I have a life that I'm very grateful for. I have no time or desire to be an addict. I simply want to use these three substances on three different days to lessen the Kratom withdrawals and after those three days I have a plethora of natural neurotransmitters, healthy foods, exercise and supplements ready to go.

So my question is, will those other two substances actually lessen my symptoms or will they contribute to them? From what I've read, Kratom works on different receptor sites or in different ways than the others do. I'm just hoping they will help with the severity of symptoms so I can get through the worst of it and then I'll be good to go.

**Base use**: *daily* for about 4-5 weeks about 30-45 ml per day (about 3 shots) usually starting in the mid afternoon (first shot about 2-3:00PM, than another shot every 3 hours.  Most shots in one day is probably 8, but that was uncommon.   Usually 3 shots/day.

**Taper/Wean Off Plan**: 2 doses a day, one around lunch time and a second around dinner time (that's close to what I am used to).  12 days of weaning the dosages - Day One (today) 12 ml AM and PM (that's about 80% of a full bottle/shot, a full bottle is 15 ml).  Then it's a ""see-saw"" pattern each day of lowering ONE dose, so day two is 10 ml AM and 12 ml PM, etc.  Over 12 days it takes me down to 2 ml (a tiny amount) just once on the last day.

In *milliliters* the taper is:

12-12

10-12

10-10

8-10

8-8

6-8

I figure going this fast won't totally thwart withdrawal but it might make the horrible psychological part less severe...maybe...I think.  I have only been taking kratom for 5 weeks but dependance is dependance and I am not sure if once it happens it doesn't matter how long you have been dependent, the withdrawal from 5 years is the same as the withdrawal from 5 weeks, logically this seems incorrect but receptors in the brain change quickly and just stay that way.  But I am guessing.

Is kratom weaning/tapering a bit more forgiving than other opioids?  Cold turkey and tapering on oxycodone and suboxone is brutal.  Perhaps kratom is less cruel?  I can't taper for months, I can't take that pressure.  I can handle a fairly short taper like this one, about 2 weeks.  **Will it help, or just make my dependance worse by extending the time of use?**   Can I walk off with my 12 day see-saw taper after 5 weeks of daily use, or am I screwed either way?  Kratom is a mystery to me.  Thanks for any and all feed back and input.  Sorry for the long post.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46318707}"

Long day yesterday but discovered something. I have had Modafinil in my “cabinet” for years. Didn’t take much of it when I was taking high K doses as it just increased my already high anxiety levels. Yesterday AM took 50mg (1/2 tablet) and man oh man what a lift! Almost forgot that I was passed my 2.5 hour window to dose again and felt NO WD throughout the day. Sitting here on day 28 and did same. I’m going to stretch my dosing out to every 3 hours and cut doses to 5/day. At this point I’ll be down to 15g. The Modafinil makes a HUGE difference for me. I am not encouraging anyone to add this to your taper, I am simply sharing my own experience. Side note: I had previously taken modafinil for energy prior to my starting K and have no issues with it. I also personally have never had issues starting and stopping and personally have ever experienced any addictive qualities. I’m stoked!",2,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.67483044}"

I've been on about 30 grams/day of Kratom for about 6 years now. Prior to my Kratom habit, I was addicted to oxys for about a year and a half, and wanted a safe, legal, and easily accessible alternative.

I just went through an 8 day CT withdrawal, and had a slip up on day 9. I binged for about 3 days, then threw it all out to try again.

I've gone through withdrawals probably 8-10 times over the past 6 years. And, it seems like every time it gets harder and harder. I'm at my wit's end, and I'm starting to feel like I just can't do this on my own.

I'm starting to seriously consider rehab; but, I have this sort of embarrassing feeling for considering rehab for Kratom. I feel like I should be able to kick it on my own.

Has anyone gone to rehab for Kratom? If so, did it help? Did you lose your job? Are you still sober?

I've been getting pretty good sleep and waking up early and energized. By and large, I feel no continued withdrawal symptoms.

The first 4 days of the taper were probably the worst, were I started at 9gpd and by day 4 I was at about 3gpd.  On day 7 I jumped, where I had 0.4g that day.

The feeling being off kratom is fairly indescribably. In a short period of time, my eating and sleeping habits are back to normal, but I think the most pronounced effect is my energy level is extremely stable throughout the day. I wake up and within 30s I have the same general energy throughout the rest of the day. It used to take me hours, and several doses of kratom to even get going. Ugh, what a shit existence.

Some other notables... My sense of taste and smell have increased I'd say 20-fold.  I have damaged sinus and nasal passages from smoke inhilation, so it hasn't been great for 10 years or so. But this is probably the best it's been in the last 4 or 5 years.

Also, I don't have to piss every 20min.  That's a damn blessing in of itself. I just pee... Normally? Every few hours? No constant thirst and dehydration. No head fog.  No wild emotional swings. Just normal, everyday living.

My exercise/workouts have improved. Running no longer feels like I'm dragging lead weights for legs. My heart doesn't feel like it's going to pound out of my chest.

It's a good exercise for internalizing the need to quit, and hopefully some of you will provide support and feedback for helping me get through this as well. It's a lot, so thank you in advance if you make it through.

I've been using Kratom now for about 2-3 years (hard to pin down exactly when it first started). Drugs and alcohol have been a pretty regular part of my life since I was 17 and I just turned 28. I had a crazy period from 17-19 where I basically smoked weed all day, everyday and was dabbling in psychedelics as well. I also smoked cigarettes from 15-21ish. I'd consider that period of 17-19 as bad I ever would allow myself to get. While what I'm going through now with kratom is really bad in its own way, at that time I was totally lost, I was stealing shit to pay for weed, dropped out of school temporarily, and was bordering on homelessness. Today, I'd consider myself super extroverted, a blossoming entrepreneur, and a hard core athlete. Despite drugs and alcohol being a regular part of my life for a decade, I eat really well and have consistently done something athletic on average 5 days a week, 1-2 hours a day since I was a kid. Mostly skateboarding, jiu jitsu, and a little bit of lifting/cardio. In fact some of my jiu jitsu buddies also liked kratom for ""recovery"" after hard training days.. As I'm sitting here writing this, it's amazing to think how seemingly functional and ambitious I've remained over the past couple considering how deep I've gone down the kratom rabbit hole. While I'm not totally sure the full scope of the damage yet, I know certain aspects of my life have and are suffering as a result of my daily use. But, we'll get to that in a bit..

Anyway, during that time of 17-19, on top of the drugs, I was experiencing the aftermath of my parents going through a bad divorce and trying to find my way as a legal adult.  I had no emotional, philosophical, or altruistic base to guide me and it spiraled into complete chaos. Ironically, as a result of psychedelics, going to concerts, a couple great mentors, and eventually getting kicked out of my mom's house, somewhere in that period I had what I would consider a massive philosophical break through, probably a couple of them that helped not only get me out of that mess, but laid what I thought was going to be sustainable emotionally and philosophical foundation that would propel me throughout life. Over the next several years I made leaps and bounds in fitness, education, and my career. I graduated college with a high GPA, traveled the world, found work in an industry I love, and felt like the world was my oyster for the taking.

Eventually I quit cigarettes and took a long break from weed, but from about 20-25, I stuck primarily to disciplined weed usage and very occasional psychedelics. However, somewhere in there I started drinking a 1-2 whiskies most days a week for about a year before finding kratom. I rarely got drunk, but started recognizing it was an everyday thing and needed to be addressed. I don't really remember when I first took kratom, but what I do remember was that when I started kratom, I thought it was a miracle drug and I instantly quit drinking. It was a drug that was a cumulation of the best parts of my some of favorite drugs: weed, coffee, alcohol, and Adderall. It also helped calm my bowel habits and because the high is mild, relative to a lot of other things I'd done over the years, it seemed safe enough to do often and seemed like a good alternative to weed, alcohol, and even Adderall (that I used for school). While I still think the actual effects are fairly mild, the dependency and withdrawals are fucking nuts for a seemingly innocent and mild drug. Of all the drugs I've experimented with either short term or long, nothing has been harder to kick than this. Even harder than cigarettes. It seems things that tend to be more mild and easy to function on, like kratom and cigarettes, are actually way more dangerous than drugs that fuck you up, because they become slowly ingrained into your day to day lifestyle, to the extent where at first you don't notice and everything is nice, and then 2 years later you realize, holy shit I've been doing this every day for two years and now I can't quit.... It's crazy looking back to see all the hype arguing it's nothing to worry about. It's a safe plant in the coffee family right? Never trust an article that glorifies a drug, I suppose is an important lesson there..

Anyway, it definitely helped my quit drinking everyday and learn to contextualize alcohol long term. Today, I rarely drink and feel like drinking and weed are both drugs I've learned to carefully contextualize and remain disciplined around. So why the fuck is kratom so hard? It's weird to feel like I have certain substances and areas of life on lock, but then struggle so much with quitting Kratom. The withdrawals are definitely a major reason for that, but nonetheless it makes it challenging to know what the best way to address this long term is and what the root behavioral or emotional issues are that need addressing. I think given I did overcome some major life adversity as a teenager, and because I made what seemed like a revolutionary transformation from that, I've dismissed the idea that I could ever struggle with drugs again and that there's no way I would ever let something ruin my life like it did as a teenager. I've also tried to lean on the fact that I eat really well, work out everyday, have career goals and ambition, as a metic for saying that I'm above needing help and that any addiction that I have will work itself out with more working out and more work ethic. Obviously that's horribly misguided and I've come to a place where I feel like my goals, athleticism, work ethic, and overall health is actually taking a major toll because of my excessive kratom use. I had a boss I really liked, in a job I really like, tell me she felt like on one hand I was one of her hardest workers, but on the other that occasionally certain projects or tasks seemed to disappear into a black hole and that there were time where I didn't seem present or engaged enough in the work. While that full time job came to an end primarily because of COVID and an interest in doing my own thing (luckily it ended on good terms and I still do contract work with them), in hindsight, I can't help but feel like the black hole tendencies and lack of presentness in the work was (in part at least) a result of daily kratom use. My girlfriend also said recently that she feels I've been less present and seem less charismatic or energized around people. These points of feedback in particular were my major wake up calls for needing to question and address this problem seriously. It's crazy how the mind has such a subtle way of fucking with you and trapping you in habits that slowly erode parts of your body and life over a long period of time...

Fast forward, I've been a freelancer in the entertainment industry for the past 4ish years and ever since the first lockdown, I've becoming increasingly more and more isolated with increasingly less work opportunity. Like I said in the beginning, I'm very extroverted and have worked in socially stimulating environments like restaurants and music venues since I was a 18. Most of my professional freelance work has been in music and so when covid hit I was working a full time job and freelancing in music venues and forced out of work and into isolation like most people. I'm in a blue state with full winters, which means that things are on and off in strict lock downs and it's currently snowing which means there is hardly any recreation or work to get me out the house right now.  On top of that, my girlfriend is currently finishing up medical school in another state and so I often feel like I'm going through this crazy time alone and going through my addiction problems alone. All of that is to say, I've been experiencing an overdose of isolation the past 9 months (like many people) and it's only compounded my kratom use. I also find myself spending several hours a day mindlessly scrolling through social media which may be as bad if not worse than taking kratom given I want to run a business a need to maximize every precious hour. Some days it's hard to tell which is more damaging towards my goals, my phone or kratom.. Probably both in their own ways. Either way, I can tell it's takes me a minute to warm up the smooshing chops when I'm out socializing, and it seems lately like I'd rather stay at home and get high than find opportunities to stay socially engaged during this time. There's no doubt that those opportunities are limited right now, but still I find myself prioritizing kratom over doing other things I love and feeling anxious about doing things out of the house if I don't take kratom first. Classic addiction stuff and again it just feels so weird and out of character to be in this place at this point in my life.

The phone is a whole other discussion. It's really a cultural problem and is probably one of the most dangerous things for productivity, being present, and maintaining momentum. Literally everyone in a developed world is consuming media on their phone at least an hour or two per day... It's daunting thinking about contextualizing that one considering there's very few people in existence that have gone through the fire and managed to refine a discipline around their phone and media consumption habits..So that's a thing too. Anyway, at some point in the last several months, the isolation and feedback from my girlfriend has really exposed my aggressively compounding addictions to my phone and kratom. It's clear they are real issues that need to be addressed immediately if I hope to successfully accomplish my long term businesses and fitness goals. Here's the real kicker though, in the past week, I've started to feel a perpetual sickness. I've had really bad abdominal pain which is probably from constipation, and is the 5th time maybe I've had this issue. I even went to a doctor the last time thinking I had colon cancer or something serious and after some blood work and a cat scan, they determined nothing was wrong ""necessarily"" but that I should definitely quit kratom. The pain is back and my guess is that the backup of bowel movements is releasing bacteria that is making me feel particularly lethargic and shitty the last week.

So here's my plan. I'm going to taper down to 1 tea per day starting today and end totally by Sunday next week or when I feel like the withdrawals are manageable enough to power through. Hopefully sooner than Sunday. I tried to go cold turkey today and I literally felt like I was on a mild psychedelic drug. I felt dizzy, anxious, lots of mixed thoughts and emotions towards all kinds of things and physically super lethargic achy, and no appetite. Surprisingly I had moments where.I felt clear, stable, and the best I've felt in a long time, but those don't last more than a few minutes and the negatives effects are rough. Becuase of that, I decided an aggressive taper may be more productive and less of a shock to my body. Plus, given how long I've been doing it now, I need to relearn how to live without it, so I'm not sure quitting abruptly is going to teach me the discipline I need long term or that it's a sustainable path. So I'm going to stay focused and go the aggressive taper route. If I start to feel worse (sometimes I feel worse on one a day than if I had just done none) I'll just cold turkey it and force myself to figure it out.

Those positive feelings of normalcy I briefly felt today are the light at the end of the tunnel and a reminder that daily kratom use is not normal and although I don't know exactly what to expect long term from where I'm sitting right now, I know quitting long term is going to dramatically improve the quality of every aspect of my life. Btw, I only drink tea and usually it's 4 grams per dose, on average 2-3 times per day.  I've been off and on cutting back and taking breaks for months now, but nothing consistent, and nothing longer than a week. So, this time I'm setting a measurable goal of 1 week at one doses max per day and then a 30 day minimum total quit to start. Hopefully that will go on indefinitely, but 30 days is practical, manageable, and doesn't feel overwhelming, so I'll start small and build from there.

Also, I recently bought this thing called a ""Kitchen Safe"" on Amazon a while ago and I believe is the only thing that will help me stay course during this process. I actually bought it to lock away my phone when working, but have been using it to limit my kratom use. It's essentially a hard plastic box with a lid that locks. The lid has a timer on it that once set can't be opened until the timer is up or your break it. It's expensive so you don't want to break it. There's literally no way to hack it open by taking out the battery or anything and you can set it for minutes, hours, and days. So far in my attempts to taper and manage my phone time, it's been the only thing to work, as it externally forces you to be disciplined rather than relying on your own will power to get your through. 

In conclusion that is a broad stroke look at my drug and alcohol journey over the last decade leading me up to where I am at now in wanting to quit kratom and dramatically moderate my phone time as well. Writing it out has been a helpful exercise and definitely help internalize how I got here, what my goals are, and why I need to quit. If you made it this far, thank you. If you have any advice, thoughts, questions, feedback, please let me know. I can use all the support I can get looking into the coming days, weeks, and months...",36,"{'covid': 2, 'lockdown': 1}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.47053513}"

i’m 19 weeks pregnant (next week i’m at official halfway point.) i’ve been tapering down since i found out the news of course. i wasn’t even taking much when i found out, i was actually damn near off - with the help of staying busy with adderall and drinking during this quarantine crap. well both of those were obviously cut out the minute i found out, but i knew kratom would be a process. i’m a naturally very petite person, so i just started to show and things have gotten really real for me now that i have a small bump and can slightly feel some movement. i love this baby so damn much already. 

i immediately told my doctor about kratom at my first appointment with him. he had never heard of it before and i had to educate him and let him know that ppl withdrawal from it the same way they do opiates. i wanted him to be completely aware so he can check for those signs and symptoms during my pregnancy. 

every time i’m in need of my next dose, whenever i feel decent knowing it’s probably from my dose, whenever i feel withdrawal - i worry about my baby. i worry nonstop. it’s just an awful anxiety filled nightmare in every single way for me right now. 

i’m down to taking 3 caps 3x daily. when i found out i was pregnant, i was only taking 2 caps 2x a day. so technically, my baby hasn’t been taking massive amounts of this stuff with me. i’ve read a ton of blogs and forums about pregnant mom’s taking a butt load of kratom the entire time. surprisingly a lot of positive stories too! those have been great to read, but it doesn’t really matter after u find the few that say their baby experienced withdrawal at birth, from taking anywhere as little as 5g a day. some of the forums justify taking kratom by talking about all the pharmaceuticals pregnant women are prescribed to with healthy babies. 

i don’t care what anyone says to be honest. all i know is that when i don’t take kratom, i withdrawal. i can’t imagine that being good for my baby, so that’s why it’s taken me even this long to get off, or i would’ve jumped a long time ago. i just feel like i’m at a stand still with my taper. it isn’t even that much and i’m struggling. i can’t take this mental nightmare anymore. 

i guess i’m just looking for some suggestions on the safest and least amount of withdrawal from 5 grams a day. i swear i’m already a good mother to my baby. i force myself to drink extra water every day, i get all of my healthy meals in, exercise 3x a week, take my prenatal vitamins. anything i can do for a healthy and happy baby. it’s just this one fucking thing always lingering in my life, and i need it to be over with now 😔",9,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.38952258}"

I definitely dont have the focus / motivation I did on kratom maybe 75%, but im sure that will come back over the next few months. I do enjoy what I do for work in general and I have to say I really did have a good week. 

This weekend I am just relaxing and seeing some family tomorrow. Things are getting better.  The boredom i felt in the evenings basically day 7 - 15 has basically disappeared.  Those times were the toughest for me as I would start thinking about kratom, but I haven't had many strong urges in the past week.  Im sure at a point they will come, but it surprisingly has not been as bad as I expected. 

Symptoms I still have 

* Slight RLS only when I wake up in the morning 
* Sneezing
* Dry Cough (thought it went away, but it came back.  Got a covid test and was negative)
* Lack of focus at times / motivation 

Happy to say that sleep is back to normal.  I am waking up around 6:30-7 A.M. every morning, but honestly thats probably just normal. The only reason I was sleeping to 9 A.M. is because of Kratom in the first place.  I almost forgot how much I love drinking coffee in the quite morning watching the sun rise.  I can say the worst night of sleep i had in the last week was the one day I didn't exercise. 

Went for a run today did another 3 miles. The exercise i believe has helped speed up the recovery big time. 

Within reach of 30 days which i would consider a first big milestone.

Been reading through and happy that I haven’t just been losing my mind and Kratom is the culprit. I’ve been drinking tea for a couple years. It was about 3-4 16 oz cups every other day and then with the pandemic I started hitting it harder. I started drinking 4-5 every day. It’s was costing me a ton because I was buying from a bar. I finally started buying powder and making my own a couple months ago. I use 1/4 cup in a full coffee maker. I’ve recently started to notice it’s harder and harder to get out of bed. It’s never been easy but once I got going and worked out I was usually good to go until the Eve when I drank my tea. I slowly started hitting it earlier and earlier in the day and I’m starting to feel exhausted and depressed until I get it in me. I’ve dosed down to 2-3 16oz cups a day now. Basically, since it’s not in capsule form I’m not sure how much I’ve actually been dosing and what I should expect from quitting. I’m also looking for more validation that Kratom is, in fact, the cause of a lot of my physical and mental symptom getting worse.

I’ve been a lurker in this community for a long time and I’ve struggled on/off with opioids and kratom.  

I ordered a product called Opi Cure or Opi-C, and it’s main ingredient is Voacanga Africana (which contains ibogaine/voacangine) and it *completely* eliminated withdrawal symptoms.  Yes, completely.  Amazing.  

Normally I’d have anxiety, lethargy, depression, diarrhea, sweating, chills—with this stuff (4 caps every 4 hours) I have felt totally normal.  It’s the closest thing to a “miracle” I’ve ever seen.  It’s a bold claim and I was honestly blown away with the results (I expected it not to work at all).  

There isn’t much on this supplement when searching, and a few people seem to think it’s a scam.  All I can say is it worked for me and I would definitely recommend to anyone going through the hell that is opioid withdrawal.  Could be a lifesaver.

EDIT: reporting back after finishing the supplement. I have been off kratom for 5 days now and no Opi C either for 2 days and I feel 90% normal.  I’ve also been megadosing vitamin C and doing the Wim Hof method.

**2nd edit**:  Because I believe in this product, and have referred a lot folks to them, they just created a discount code (MATT) for 20% off your order.  Full disclosure, I will receive a small commission from this code. I made this post before this program was available.",55,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.8155312}"

But, I was drinking a few cups.of.kava bar at the very place I was consuming a majority of my kratom.  Strangely, though, it was not a mental craving. It was purely a physical manifestation.  Once I left, came home, took a shower, and admittedly took 1/2 a klonopin, I felt fine, went to sleep by 11, and woke up at 7am feeling great. I don't have a script or any sort of access to klonopin, I just happen to have 2, which I've had lying around for months, just in case.  It was well worth it, at that point, to use it.

Just because I'm not a kratom user anymore doesn't mean I don't want to socialize haha. I've been exercising heavily, eating great, and getting my life in order. I don't go to bars because the temptation to drink is just too much, plus I hate the environment of cocky drunk-ass morons.. But the kava bar has a lot of geniuinly nice people, with interesting stories, and lives. I'll still go there.

The entire day yesterday, besides late at night, I felt great. I'm pretty surprised and happy that I wasn't completely miserable during this taper and quit. I was consuming so much kratom, with such regularity, that I thought I was doomed. Luckily, things worked out.

Today I'm going to do about 6hrs of hard fencing work and clean up my house. It's nice to have the energy to be productive again.

I commented a few months back that I was going to try tapering down from 10-15g and am now down to 2 tsps once a night (roughly 4-6g depending on strain). At that current dose I’m still pretty, addled and foggy brained, sore, and fatigued. So, I again tried to taper down to 1.5tsp, however the euphoria was so minimal that I couldn’t resist topping it off for a buzz. 

So I’m sort of of hovering a 2 tsp right now afraid to cross the rubicon’ so to speak, though some days I’ll avoid it entirely and chug kava till I’m too sleepy to care. 

So, I’m thinking of integrating stem and vein to help with my taper before jumping. Is the idea to slowly replace your kratom powder with increasing portions of stem and vein until it’s completely SaV and then taper/drop afterwards?
Or do you keep increasing the SaV ratio to a point, and then taper the mix down to zero?

Lastly, I have a question about how SaV apparently reduces tolerance. Initially I was looking for insomnia alternatives to ambien when I found kratom. But what I didn’t realize, was that routine kratom use completely nullified the effects of Ambien. I took a trip a year ago, leaving the K at home and used my prescribed 10mg dose of Ambien for 3 nights in a row and it’s effectiveness was like 10-20% and barely noticeable. My guess is  Kratom must be making use of a lot of the same receptors as Ambien, and caused my tolerance to sky rocket. Would that be plausible?

So, I “m wondering if SaV is able to reduce K tolerance, would it also help lower my suddenly high Ambien tolerance?

FYI: I’ve used Ambien for over 10 years roughly 4-5 days a week, without the crazy sleep walking side effects or anything. Even after several years it’s been pretty consistently effective with the only side effects being a bit of fatigue in the afternoon and some ADD. I have a ton of anxiety around sleep due to a medical condition and Ambien has been a life saver and kept my depression at bay for years. So I feel it’d be much less daunting to ween off kratom and back on to my prescribed 10mg Ambien and then work with my sleep therapist again from there.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5729793}"

Dreams about frustrating things like kids breaking my electronics, wife spending more money than we have, then wife cheating on me with multiple people while we were away for a date weekend. 

These are the kind of very strong negative emotions I haven’t really had to face yet since quitting. In the back of my mind I’m worried how I will respond when life truly challenges me. I suppose that’s why they say to practice good self care habits even when things are going well so when tough times come you know exactly what to do to get through them.

Well my kratom addiction had taken 4 years of my life at this point. I was so close to freedom last time I tried quitting i made it to the end of day 3 and caved for insane reasons such as boredem and not wanting to be in pain, well that cave was December 10th, and I have been using it since.

My anxitey from taking it has doubled in the past most that I'm pairing it with very small amounts of Ativan just to get through the day at work. I wasted my only time I could take serveral days off work and failed. I'm so ashamed and defeated. I feel like subconsciously my mind hate Kratom so much that my body is completely rejecting it giving me terrible Anxitey and other physical symptoms. 

I really don't know what to do anymore, I want to just quit so bad, but I have to work and support all my bills and feel so trapped in this hellish cycle. I'm so worried that I'm starting to become dependant on the Ativan as well, that is not going to help me get through withdrawls what so ever, I'm making thing worse for myself everyday by repeating the same thing expecting it to be better today then it was yesterday, but it NEVER is...

The whole first week I had no desire to do anything, mostly because I was so freezing cold, and laying perfectly still under a ton of blankets and warm baths were the only thing that would help. I basically just laid in bed and binged a bunch of shows, because I couldn't even bring myself to do any of my favorite hobbies. 

This week, I had to return to work after my holiday break. The first day back (two days ago), I knew I wasn't ready. I felt like I was in a dream, and not in like an enchanting, happy sort of way. It was a dissociative kind of dreamlike state and it was just very odd. I got through it, but I'm still finding work a challenge to get through. I feel so physically weak and exhausted and my job is physically and mentally intense already, so my performance has been suffering. But I also don't want to tell my bosses what is going on, because I don't want them to fire me for coming to work basically under the influence for the last year.

This week in particular I am having a harder time falling and staying asleep. I can only manage to stay asleep about 2-3 hours and then wake up and can't fall back asleep for a few hours. I feel like this is partially why I feel so weak, but normally I can chug an energy drink and feel fine, but energy drinks have been doing nothing for me lately. 

I'm also just plagued by apathy and lack of motivation. I used to always come home and play video games for hours until I was sleepy and it was bedtime. Now, I take my warm bath and literally just lay in bed and just think about all the things I want to do but physically cannot get up and do anything. 

I know it will pass, and I have to pay the pauper, but I guess I just need reassurance that I'm going to want to play my favorite games again, and even though I don't love my job, I'll be able to be good at it again. That my creativity will come back and I'll want to do makeup again. That I'm going to want to talk to people again and not just seclude in my bedroom.

I started kratom in 2015.  I was having so many problems...Fibromyalgia, hormone imbalances, depression, anxiety, etc.

Kratom solved my problems, it seemed.  It took away my pain which was HUGE.  I previously had been prescribed Percocet and was getting it regularly...I must say I was very controlled with Percocet, I did not abuse it but eventually I needed more to handle my pain.  I suffered with severe constipation while on Percocet and I also found it to suppress my mood (even intimacy with my husband became a challenge.)

&#x200B;

Searched high and low for a better solution and came across Kratom on a site I frequented.  Received my first order, after extensive research and immediately, I WAS AMAZED! No pain, no anxiety, no depression, energy, euphoria, and overall contentment.

&#x200B;

I used .5 g for a long while, 2x per day, which of course gradually increased.  About 2 years in, I noticed that I would no longer get the euphoria but I still got a boost of  energy, and some pain relief.  I did all the things you are told to do to reduce tolerance, but eventually tolerance became an issue.    


Of course, I would only be here to talk about that if it were not for all the negatives that have crept up on me.  By the time I realized that I wanted to quit, I had experienced the following:

**Hair loss**....MAJOR! Practically bald right now, no exaggeration!  Had to unclog my shower drain and what I pulled out was half the hair that used to be on my head.  Strangely enough, I never connected my gradual hair loss with K.

**Loss of period**...first it was just making periods shorter...26 days, then 25, then 23...then a skipped month, and NOW no period at all.

**Weight loss**, particularly muscle loss..I am so flabby and SOFT now, whereas I used to have natural muscle tone, without much exercise.

**Hot flashes, night sweats**, etc...Very intense

**Extreme constipation** \- K used to help with this but then it started to exacerbate it

**Vision changes**

**Overall haggard look**, I think

I am sure there is more I am missing, this list is not exhaustive.    


2020...I decided to quit and tapered with kratom pills although I always used loose powder and did the Toss n Wash method from Day 1.  The pills were an easy way to measure, which I had stopped doing long ago.  I would shake what seemed to be the right amount into a cup...I think I was up to 20-30 GPD.  I tapered pretty quickly, over the course of two weeks...It was not easy but not terrible.  I have never experienced Withdrawal before bc I don’t use drugs, but on a scale of 1 -10, the withdrawals I experienced were a 6.  I was able to manage but it was uncomfortable.

I am now 11 days out from my last dose...still sweating 😓profusely, pain although it is subsiding, hair loss has presumably slowed, but not sure if I will regain my hair, and still no period.

I don’t know what Kratom has done or if the effects are reversible, I truly feel that my Endocrine system has been changed/damaged and I imagine after 5 years of use, some of these things may not return to normal.  I am hopeful but not naive...

I would tell anyone who is considering Kratom to reconsider.  I only looked at the other forums of people who were currently using K and in its good graces, which was helpful, but for the FULL STORY, one should check out this forum, to get a true idea of what could happen.    


I had no intentions of abusing K but with regular, daily use, it is inevitable...you will reach a level of tolerance and that will create a need to use more and then it begins...

Kratom was incredible and I was amazed at the relief I felt in so many areas but then it became something I was a slave to and I can’t have that!

I began using kratom past January. I used it about 3 months then quit CT ( experiencied heavy WS for a day or 2) then I used it for about a month again back in July, with mild WS upon cesation, and finally I used it for about 1.5 months everyday since november, until I quit it again 3 weeks ago.  


The max dosage I used was around 12 gpd.  


As expected, the withdrawal symptoms the first week were terrible, however even though they subsided a bit after the first week, they still remain, and quite intensively.  
I feel some sort of RLS although it seems different this time... I feel a very strange feeling of restlesness in my legs and arms and my mandible is very tight. The intensity varies within the day... Although I do train every day and take cold showers which seem to help a lot. However, by the end of the day I'm completely drained and I don't have the energy to deal with any of my other projects.  


As a background, I've been taking  SSRIs for a year  
\- I've been driniking quite a bit in the past weeks due to the festivities. Symptoms seem to increase heavily upon hangover, which I've been on at least 1/3 of the time within those 3 weeks.  
\- I'm in a restrictive carnivore/keto diet. I did try to add carbs and other stuff for a few days, however symptoms remained the same.  


\-I got some Pregabalin to help out with the restlesness and it does work a  bit (although not entirely remove it) However, pregabalin in pretty much the drug I'm most afraid of, I take it as little as I can since the withdrawal of that is also terrible.  
\- I've been taking sleeping pills for a few months (Lunesta in my country's version) and it seems that it would be very hard to sleep without it due to the restlessness ( which it does seem to help with as well)  
I'm quite adicted to coffee... Although I've been cutting it off since it seems to trigger the restlesness.  


I'm not quite sure what is going on, I guess I'll quit drinking/coffee as well. I'm a bit scared TBH since it's been 3 weeks and the symptoms are far from gone, and I can't keep on living like this",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6098176}"

I’d use a different bathroom during the day and dose what seemed like every hour in the other one.

A few things that helped me this time, to make it this far:

Week 1:  gabapentin and some OTC supps.  Black seed oil, CBD, Metamucil, and magnesium all seemed to help a lot week one.  Exercise was also a huge weapon to fight the struggle early on.

Week 2 and beyond:  naltrexone has saved my ass a handful of times this quit.  Had some rough moments, but thankfully the naltrexone works for longer than the cravings stay with me.  Support in the form of therapy, this forum, and AA / NA has been invaluable.  Exercise has remained a part of my routine too.

Unfortunately there doesn’t seem to be a magic bullet to get better.  Addiction is a disease I have to fight every day.  Some days are easier than others, but the fight always gets easier with time.  Getting clean is doable for me, staying clean has been the tough part.  I’ve had nearly six years clean once, then countless multiple month stretches before I relapse.  I’m pretty sick of the cycle, so I’m trying a lot of new things.  The therapy I’m doing is new, and I’m determined to work the 12 steps in AA / NA this time through.  I have a sponsor, and have my second meeting with him later today.  I’ve quit competitive bodybuilding, as every show I’ve done has resulted in a relapse immediately after.  I’m also getting proactive about my chronic pain.  Just got a cortisone shot in my lumbar spine yesterday, It’s still too early to tell if that worked.  If it doesn’t, I’ll work with the doctor on other non - narcotic treatments.  I’ve also quit heavy lifting, as this  caused my back problems and kept me in pain.  I’m a full time graduate student, and it’s sort of dawned on me that I need to grow up.  I want to make school, recovery, my relationships, and my mental health my top priorities in life.

2021-01-08 09:10:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/kt359m/rapid_taper_quit_relatively_painless/,Rapid taper quit - relatively painless,"Hey everyone.  I wanted to write one long post about how I rapid tapered from Kratom over 7 days, what it was like, and how I did it.  I tried to quit CT about a year ago and didn't make it more than 24 hours.  I was using probably 30-40g a day at that point.  At the beginning of the COVID pandemic, I tapered off for a few weeks using this method at about the same gpd usage.  A few weeks later, I started back with kratom and my usage exploded.  I estimate that on average I was using 50gpd, but some days were way, way more.  This is a rough estimate because I almost never ate kratom powder.  I'd have three or four kratom drinks at my kava bar, which I just found out recently are 10g/ea, or I'd make a tea by dumping some into a jar with lime and straining it after steeping it.  I never really measured, but I'd have a \*few\* of those a day - with a 'few' being 3ish, or more.  I'd estimate there were a couple tablespoons of powder in each tea.

I'm not sure if one reason my quit has been somewhat painless is because I only had kratom in tea form or not.  I'm quite sure that tea doesn't leech out 100% of all the compounds in the powder, and some that aren't very water soluble probably don't leech out more than 25% or less.  So there's definitely some difference in my usage compared to someone who took pills or toss-and-washed powder.

**Taper Approach**

My general approach to tapering had three ground rules:

1. Never have more today than I had yesterday, period.
2. Save a larger portion of today's dose for bedtime, so I can sleep.  I feel like sleep is a very important aspect of recovery and didn't want to jeopardize it with wild RLS or anxiety/restlessness.  This worked very well.
3. Wait until as late as possible, enduring the withdrawal symptoms as long as possible

I didn't really have a set schedule.  I know what the tapering guide says, to maintain a consistent amount of kratom in your system but linearly decrease over the long haul.  That's probably a great long-term approach and I have no doubt that would work.  But I was really sick of being on kratom.

I chose arbitrarily a 9g first daily allotment.  Over 8 days, that went to 0g, with the very last day, day 8, I had 0.4g.

**Medications / Supplements / Helpful Things**

As far as medications go, I only really took Mitrazapine and melatonin for sleep, and Calm magnesium powder.  I ended up buying Shilijat and Black Seed Oil, but starting using the Shilijat today for working out and the Black Seed Oil I used the first couple days in the morning and really didn't notice any difference at all.  I also read it might interact with the Mitrazapine so I chose to keep using the Mitrazapine.

Mitrazapine was very helpful.  I got this a few months back because I couldn't get to sleep so my Primary Care Physician prescribed it in 5mg tablets, saying I could take up to 30mg to help me get to sleep.  A few months back, I was constantly exhausted at work.  Having to try to get sleep in my truck during lunch, and I'd just sit there and listen to my heart slam in my chest.  It was so miserable.  I'd sleep at night, for 8 or 9 hours, but could barely get out of bed.  I attributed this ALL to the Mitrazapine.  Well, I was wrong.  Because I pop out of bed now, bright eyed and bushy-tailed, and have constant, clean energy all day, with no lethargy whatsoever, and no kratom.  I typically took 5 to 10mg of mitrazapine around 8:30pm and went to bed at 10pm.  I was a little restless at times, but I alwasy was able to sleep a good 6 to 7hrs, at least, with regular wake-ups.  But I was able to get back to sleep

Exercise was probably the single most beneficial thing I did during my taper.  During this time period, I decided to work on my physical fitness.  I've fluctuated between being extremely physically fit, to being extremely obese over the last 10 years.  I spent 10 years in the military during which time I was very fit, and the proceeding 10 years I got very fat from alcoholism, then very fit in recovery, then skinny but out-of-shape from kratom use and lack of exercise.  A few days before I started my taper, I ran some slow sprints and did some kettlebell workouts to ensure I'd start my taper able to work out very hard without getting sore for days.  This was key, because having post-workout muscle soreness on kratom isn't nearly as bad...  So for probably a week before I started to taper, I was getting my body ready for the taper.

My approach to exercise was to simply wear myself out.  I want to gain 20lbs of muscle this year as an overall goal, but now is not the time for that.  In my opinion, if you're not already lifting weights, don't start during your quit.  I didn't want to hurt myself - which would've jeopardized my taper immensely.  My workouts were crossfit style high intensity interval workouts, along with some medium-during intense cardio.  For instance, a typical workout is running 1.5mi at a fast pace, then about 10 min recover, then a circuit workout of kettlebells doing 10 x Kettlebell Swings, 10 x Kettlebell Squats / Lunges, 10 x Shoulder Presses (each shoulder), 10 x regular push-ups.  I'd do this as many times as I could in 20 minutes.  It really, really, wears you out.  Then, I'd make myself a protein shake, drink it, and take an ice cold shower.  I'm no fan of cold showers any more than you are, but they help.  They release beneficial cold-shock protiens and I felt great for a minimum of 2-3hrs after each workout.

At the beginning of this taper I was off work, so I worked out around 1pm.  Towards the end (days 5-8) I was at work, so I worked out at 5pm.  I would work out before I touched any kratom.  This gave me the extra boost I needed to push my first dose out as long as possible.  On one day, I think day 5, I had 0.4g of kratom around 1pm and worked out at 5pm because I felt miserable at work.  You gotta do what you gotta do.

The other things I found helpful were just staying extremely busy.  At work, it was strangely easy to simply concentrate on my job instead of being distracted by kratom all day like I was all of last year.  But on my off days, I did lots of yard work, house work, went to the beach (it's warm where I live), took my dogs to the park.  Anything to distract myself before that first dose.

**Overall Results**

Today is day 9 I think.  I feel very little craving for Kratom, slept 9hrs last night, and woke up energized and ready-to-go.  The first few days were admittedly a little rough, but I pushed through the day and had simply enough kratom to keep serious w/d symptoms at bay.  The worst days I think were day 2-4, where I felt a constant internal restlessness, some headfog and headache, and very slight back/flank pain.  But other than that, it's been generally very manageable for someone who had such a high dose.

Also, just in a little over a week, I've seen noticeable gains in my physical training abilities, have had much better and even energy throughout the day.  None of the ridiculous 30min energy after kratom, then 2hrs of shit waiting to have more.

**The Future**

I plan on never using kratom again.  I have an addictive personality type.  This entire thing was exacerbated by a horrible relationship that I recently freed myself of.  I don't think there's a chance in hell I would've been able to do this with my previous relationship still in tact.  As much as that pains me to say, because I was together with this person for many years, we just weren't right for each other and caused each other serious disappointment and emotional pain.  This led me to sitting on the couch at night doing nothing but slamming kratom and playing video games or watching the news.  It was a miserable existence.  Part of recovery from something like this is changing your lifestyle.  Get fit and get focused on the things in life that matter.  Cut the fat from your life.  Organize your things.  Clean you room, make your bed, and face life down.  I know that's easier said-than-done, but doing these things will *justify and reinforce your sobriety from whatever you quit*.  That's why I'm such a big proponent of exercise.  It's the one thing you can do during your day that's selfish and 100% for your own benefit.  It gives you a sense of accomplishment.  You see daily improvements in your abilities.  It gives you energy.  It makes you feel good.  It is a huge confidence boost.

I hope everyone can find a method that suits them.  This probably isn't for everyone, and I'm not pushing it anyone.  But, take from this what you can, develop your own quitting plan suited to your lifestyle, schedules, responsibilities, and face it down like it's the enemy in your life and don't let up.

 I am a long time kratom user(4 years or so) but my dosing never really got out of control. I still weigh it and only dose three times a day at 3.5-4.5 grams per dose. I thought that was high until I read some of the people here were as high as 60-80 grams per day.

 Anyway, I run out of kratoms from time to time and have gone several days to a week between orders and I still get the depression, anxiety and bad RLS, and I mean REAL bad. It kept me awake for five days one time. I was looking for solutions everywhere and realized I had like 500 pills of 100mg Gabapentin my doc prescribed around ten years ago. I hated it, it made me feel like a zombie on the doses I was prescribed for depression. So I simply stopped. I found out it can help with the RLS, and it did. Man, was I happy I had a bunch left. I only needed a 100mg dose to cease the RLS, and sometimes 200mg.

 Anyway, when my orders of kratom come I stop with the Gabapentin so I have no idea how long the RLS would have lasted had I not had the Gabapentin. Does anyone have any idea? Also, I am thinking about quitting also because it's just making me feel bagged out now. Low energy, no libido, no motivation and a deep dark depression I can't seem to shake. I'm just rambling here.

 I do have a tip for those of you that may not have meds or supplements to help with RLS. When you are in bed ready to go to sleep(Or trying to sleep) lay on your back with your arms at your side and your palms down. Put your legs up as if you are going to ride a bike and start cycling. Go as hard as you can until you feel muscle pain even. It will exhaust you and help with the symptoms and you'll get a bit of sleep.

This is my first post here and I'm currently on day 6 of a semi-CT attempt to quit Kratom from a 8gpd habit I had for around 9 months. Took around 3gpd before that for around 2 years.

I know these doses are very low compared to many others here, but I always felt like I reacted very sensitively to it and didn't need much more in order to get the desired effects.

My reason for quitting is mainly that I want to find out whether it still does anything beneficial for me or if I'm just blindly engaging in a habit that has long outlived its usefulness. I struggle with depression currently and I want to find out how Kratom affects that. So I'm not really convinced that after I've totally quit I will be better off, I really don't know that, it's basically an experiment to find out where I stand when sober for a while.

It's been tough trying to quit though. A few weeks ago I tried going CT but my brain slowly talked me into doing a taper instead which was mostly just an excuse to start taking it again I feel.I put a stop to this around 6 days ago and went CT again.

Most of the physical symptoms have stopped, RLS is mostly gone but I still struggle sleeping. The muscle ache is gone as well, I still have weird body temperature issues where I'm cold all the time but it's bearable. Also my stomach seems to be pretty upset.

Most days I feel really depressed though mentally and I struggle to do anything besides the most basic stuff. Most of the time I just mindlessly watch YT or lie on my couch or bed and stare into nothingness or kinda fall into this sleeplike twilight state where I'm kinda cut off from my surroundings. It's quite strange.

My fear is though, that this won't change even if I stay on this path of quitting. I've experienced depression before I even knew what Kratom was and during that time I actually was completely sober. So I'm worried that quitting K is not gonna improve my situation at all. But at least I'll know that the Kratom wasn't the issue and I can pursue different routes of addressing this issue, like a second therapy or antidepressants, I don't know.

After reading a few articles, I think what I have is more likely to be PLMD, and they say that L-Tryptophane might help. If you're not familiar, L-Tryptophane is something that boosts melatonin production, and can calm the muscles and help alleviate the symptoms. L-Tryptophane is the chemical that is found in turkey, and it's why people get so sleepy after Thanksgiving dinner (for those of us in North America). Other poultry, like chicken, also are high in L-Tryptophane, but not as much as turkey. It's easy to find in most places that sell vitamins and supplements.

Feeling pretty good not to much different from yesterday. Id say at this point the acutes are basically gone.  I feel minor minor RLS when I wake up and am still sneezing.  My focus and motivation isn't 100% there yet, but im not sure thats considered acutes... 

Overall life is good. The last 4-5 days ive felt pretty normal and really not many complaint. As I said yesterday I did not expect to feel as good as I do after reading some of the horror stories on this subreddit.  So for those of you who were using for under 1 year like myself the w/d might not be so bad. With that said I have also withdrawn from h / fentanyl / oxy's in my past and that withdrawal is hell. So I guess I am able to compare the experiences and this was no where as bad.

2021-01-06 14:14:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/kruwqb/trying_to_prepare/,Trying to prepare,"Hey everyone,
So I have finally gotten honest enough with myself to admit that after 4 years clean from heroin and alcohol, this Kratom has become just as much a problem physically as it is emotionally. After beating myself up inside for the past 8 months, I have finally made the decision to get off this garbage. 
At the beginning of the covid outbreak, I had just   moved across the country to a new place because we couldn’t afford to be where we were at anymore with a newly born child. I felt lost already and in the midst of my depression, made  the STUPID decision to try something new for my physical pain. Well how wrong was I...this stuff completely took ahold of me mentally almost immediately. 
I was in utter denial for the first six months that this stuff was causing me any harm, frankly because I was so upset to admit that I had gotten myself in such a position to begin with, after having thought to have made it out from the depths of hell in addiction. I was an active member in the recovery community, very connected with others, being of service. Slowly but surely I have pulled away, stopped going to meetings, all of it. I am just so embarrassed and too full of pride to walk back into those rooms and say, “here I am” once again after being an example of freedom to those still afflicted, or so I thought..
I finally admitted that I do not have mental control or a choice in being able to stop. On a daily basis I am continuing to use against my own will. After 8 months, I am certainly feeling some WD effects after about 12 hours ... and I have been fluctuating between 2-3 extract bottles OR , 20-30 GPD . It’s put such a strain on my finances and I was so financially stable for the longest time after I got sober initially. 
I want so badly to quit that I called a nearby detox and they told me I couldn’t get admitted because I did not have any other substances in my system such as heroin or alcohol or benzos. That really frustrated me.


My plan :
I got honest with my boyfriends parents and told them what’s going on, and asked them for help. They are willing to watch my son next  Friday Saturday and Sunday. I plan to take my last dose around noon on Friday and go to their house for the weekend and basically sit in a room watching TV and relaxing a until that Monday. 

I have access to several medications which are discussed frequently on this thread, so I wanted to get some input. I currently am on 1800 MG of gabapentin a day, and I’m worried that medication won’t do anything for me while detoxing since I have already been on it for the past few years. I also have phenibut, clonidine, propanonol, and Imodium. I’m also currently on adderall so I’m trying to think if it would be smart to stop for that weekend to prevent even more jitters.

All in all, I just want myself back. I want my happiness back. I want to move forward and be able to grow from this, and once again help others. I am so afraid that the obsession will be so strong once I quit that I’ll never get off this stuff. I’m wondering if Vivitrol will help? That stuff was a godsend when I got off H. But i do know that if I persevere, anything is possible.


All comments are welcome, input, or words of encouragement. And to those who are thinking of relapsing because this stuff is just a plant, just something to take the edge off, or just kill the pain, I seriously urge you to reconsider. After building my life up over the past four years, I’ve lost myself once again, and you certainly could too.

Don't ignore the signs your body is giving you!,"I'd been T&W powder daily, 5-20 GPD for 3+ years, trending toward 20 GPD for the last 1.5 years. Originally started taking for aches and pains and stress relief/general mood lift.

About a year ago I started to have persistent pain in my lower right back in the area of my Kidney. I thought might be because of my Kratom use. I got a full Kidney work-up (fasting bloodwork, Urine, Ultrasound) and things seemed completely normal, other than slightly elevated Creatinine, and small amount of protein in Urine (PCP did not have any concerns with the results), so I continued my normal routine. Went a good amount of time until the lower back pain became constant and getting worse. I decided to quit for a 2 week period and see how I felt. Within 48 hours of quitting, the lower back pain was completely gone, and stayed gone while I was off Kratom. I did not change anything else in my diet, exercise, sleep, daily routine, etc.

I then decided to test my theory that this was caused by Kratom, so after my break I started back taking 4g. Within 45 minutes back pain was already coming back. I did this, stopping for a day, waiting for the pain to subside, and taking various strains from different vendors (I've accumulated quite the collection over the last year from both GMP and non-GMP compliant vendors, but mainly GMP products. I typically take greens but I experimented with everything I have including whites, greens, and reds. All while making every effort to keep all other aspects of my routine the same. Every strain/vendor produced some form of the same lower back pain, some brought on stronger than others.

I then accepted that this was caused by the Kratom, my theory is that it is likely my liver shifting some work over to my kidneys because of the burden the Kratom was putting on my liver. I clearly do not have the acute liver toxicity some have with Kratom, but in my specific case, I can with 100% confidence say that Kratom is causing this lower back pain in the area of the kidneys. This to me is corroborated by fasting blood test creatinine levels while taking and not taking Kratom (always high when taking Kratom, always normal when not) and other diagnostics like protein in my urine while taking Kratom. There is also a study that notes Kratom as a casual agent to Rhabdomyolysis, Acute Kidney Failure, and cholestatic pattern of hepatic injury (I can provide a link to those who are interested).

Also a disclaimer, My PCP agrees that if I have concerns I should stop taking the Kratom but has not confirmed that it is the cause. He has also not identified any other cause after many follow ups, so Its hard for me to accept that it is not harming me. Since my latest tests while off (and tapering) have been normal he does not have concerns about my general health at this point.

This is just my experience, and everyone has different body chemistry so it is likely just something specific to my body, but this is enough for me to stop taking Kratom. This type of symptoms of kidney function can eventually harm the organ so I'm not going to risk it.

Dehydration: While taking Kratom, I've always maintained healthy fluid intake and my electrolyte levels have been normal in blood tests while using Kratom, while having this kratom induced pain, so no, I'm not dehydrated. My micronutrient tests are also normal, with the exception of slightly high potassium levels, other than one low potassium reading in a recent test at the ER for something unrelated (having already been off Kratom for several days).

Other health issues: Only other issue I have had is high cholesterol (most of my family does) but this has only been in the last year or so. I have no other health issues that could be attributed to this. Typical blood pressure readings are normal, normal BMI, not diabetic or pre-diabetic. No family history of CKD or liver disease.

So I stopped. I've not taken it for just about a week now.

I'm posting to share my honest story and how my unique case has played out. I think that I was taking way more than I needed. Hopefully this will help someone in the future who might be questioning how the body is reacting to Kratom, and always get your concerns checked out by your doctor.

I was a kratom user on and off for over a year. Started using it in capsule and a juice concoction form when I quit drinking, and it wiped out all cravings. 

Then, as the pandemic kicked in I was drinking it almost daily not only for back and shoulder pain from some old sports injuries, but I also just enjoyed the boost that came with it instead of booze. Throughout my usage, I stuck mostly to late afternoon around 3 - bedtime, dosing about 5 mg every couple hours until bed. I think my heaviest use was about 30mg a day.

When I started to quit, thinking it would be a breeze, I lasted maybe 7 days, and the effects of brain zaps, rls, zero sleep, sweats, anxiety, IBS etc only seemed to get progressively worse.

So I hopped back on seeing as I have two kids remote learning and work I needed to deal with—all with the intent on finding a new quitting strategy.

The one thing I noticed was that when I had hopped back on, my needed dose was cut in less than half.

Day 8 - 50gpd - 3 Years

First of all, I don’t think I could’ve made it even 8 days without this community.  What a blessing.

I could write several paragraphs about my experience with Kratom, but it wouldn’t be far off from the experiences of everyone here, so I’ll keep it condensed.

Suffice to say, what started as a warm comfort; an anxiety-eliminating, nostalgia-producing miracle compound, Kratom slowly evolved to become the master of my domain.  I was happy (high) for 3 hours at a time, when, like clockwork, the anxious realization would set in that my happiness was suspended by the delicate puppet strings of addiction.  In rare cases of 5 hours passing without a dose, it became clear that painful withdrawal would be the price of breaking this cycle...and so, I would dose again, and continue this cycle for 3 years.

Pain was certainly the price for quitting.  A full week (so far) of burning restlessness, depression, irritability, hopelessness.  A full week of sweating like a pig.  Not only did I have no energy, but it became clear during exercise that somehow my cardio endurance was devastated.  All this to say, these symptoms should sound familiar.  You are not alone.  You will get through this.  Classes of thousands of people have graduated from this addiction.  You will too.

Today is day 8, and I feel like I’m over the hill, both physically and mentally.  Not 100%, but ~90%.  I consider myself very lucky that I might not have to go through months of symptoms like many here.  Maybe you’ll get lucky too.

There’s a pretty nerdy parable here that I think makes a lot of sense.  Recall the Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.  Gandalf visits King Theoden; a poisoned shell of his former self, being sustained by a parasite in Wormtongue.  After drawing the sickness out through unrelenting force, Gandalf tells a renewed Theoden: “Breathe the free air”.

You’re both Gandalf and Theoden.  You’ve let Kratom become your Wormtongue.  Draw this poison out of yourself with unrelenting force, no matter the pain, no matter the mind tricks...

BREATHE THE FREE AIR.  You’ll be glad you did.

Thanks for reading and good luck

Tips:
1. Exercise even though you won’t want to.  You aren’t trying to beat PRs.  You’re trying to wear yourself out.  Focus on legs.

2. Try to avoid alcohol.  I wasn’t able to avoid it completely.  Although it gave temporary relief, I don’t think it did any long term favors.

3. Try to lower caffeine.  You’re going to feel very manic.  Caffeine will amplify that feeling. 

4. Remember that you can’t go around.  You have to go THROUGH.  You will make it!

Today I plan on having exactly 1g, before bed, and no more, ever. I'm not quite sure what to expect, really. But right now I feel OK, overall. I can tell my body is still getting used to detoxifying itself of Kratom, but I don't have any symptoms other than a restlessness, at the moment.

Ive gone from a 50+ gpd habit to 1g in 7 days, as I wanted. Every day I pushed myself to withstand withdrawal symptoms as long as feasible, and was able to sleep every night. Tonight or tomorrow night might be different. I'm not sure. I also don't really care. I'm quitting this stuff one way, or the other. These last 7 days were a means to an end; a method of conditioning my body to less kratom and the accompanied withdrawal symptoms and easing into the total quit.

I expect that tomorrow will suck, and maybe Friday, too. But I don't think it will be overwhelming like a CT quit is - which I've had the unfortunate pleasure of in my past.

As I reflect on the last week, I'm glad I've gone this route. It's been tough because I have kratom in my kitchen right this very second. It's at my corner store, and at the kava bar that I still go to to have kava or kambucha on occasion.

Like others, and like me in the past, I unfortunately needed to get to a point where I was more sick of being on kratom than I was nervous or anxious about quitting. It was close to rock-bottom, that's for sure.

Maybe one day I'll learn my lesson, or maybe not. But, one thing I can say for sure, is I intend to make TODAY my last day of kratom use. I'll worry about tomorrow, tomorrow.",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4855951}"

But my dumbass just couldn't help but consume adderall, caffeine, kava, weed, and alcohol within the past 24 hours. Now I have insomnia, and I'm wondering if I should try to get valium or ambien instead of dealing with it.

And all I can think is, why?

Why do I want this? Why do I think I need this drug to feel normal? Why am I not happy when I'm sober, when regular people are fine without drugs?

You don't need drugs, obviously. We only *need* water, food, shelter, etc. On a deeper level we need security, companionship, self-fulfillment. But the brain of an addict is diseased.

Drug addiction actually actively destroys your capacity to satisfy your deeper needs:

Security? You are only as secure as your ability to have drugs, otherwise every moment feels like shit. Companionship? Your relationships are codependent addicts or destroyed by your drug use. Self-fulfillment? Your dreams and ambitions are no longer necessary, you have drugs instead.

I could blame my upbringing for my drug use, or other factors in my life that are out of my control. But I chose to put all that shit in my body. If only I had stopped myself and asked why.

Maybe the reason why is because I hate myself. I don't want to succeed and accomplish the things I want to do because they are too hard, so I get high to create an excuse for myself. But, the drugs don't make me love myself any more. They just amplify the self-hate.

This sub is incredible and has helped me through many quits. I'm never going back. 

Even though I fucked up yesterday and put 5 substances into my body in an attempt to feel ""normal"", today that number will be 0. Because I can't deal with the demon that lives in my brain until I teach myself to love being sober, and to love myself and my body.

Ok maybe I'll have a cup of coffee. I'm fucking tired.

Day 20 update! Almost forgot to post... 

I think the acutes are almost gone.  This morning was the first morning I woke up and the sheets weren't completely ripped off the bed from tossing all night.  I definitely still feel a slight tingle from the RLS when I wake up, but not during the day anymore.  

Its amazing the improvement I have seen in the last 10 days. On day 10 the acutes were manageable, but just annoying.  Though mentally it was tough to get up and do anything I basically just sat around for 90% of the day and thought about doing stuff, but just couldn't.  Now 10 days later Im waking up at 7 A.M. and being productive basically all day.  I am definitely not as productive and still have some fatigue / laziness, but its so much better! I have gone almost 3 days without any thoughts of withdrawal or using.  I know there will be tough days a head, but its such a blessing to be free from kratom. 

My use was definitely not as involved as some of the others that post here so I think my recovery has been a little faster.  I also was 5.5 years clean when I relapsed in march so I do understand recovery. I was using hard opiates for 2 months and then kratom for 7 months about 30-50GPD.  For those of you that are in similar situations dont let the stories of months of depression stop you from quitting.  I am on day 20 and feel much better then I ever expected.  

Today I continued my work out routine with a 3 mile run. I have been off all helper meds for 2 weeks now as well.  

There are certain usernames I have started to look out for which is nice as it seems a lot of us have quit around the same time.  I just wanted to thank you all for posting!

Please fucking help me   
(Permanent eye wobbles and or dissociative feeling? it's similar to when you drink (dont even have to get drunk) and you enter that obviously different visual state, but im not feeling good, nor am i confident. its almost exactly like when i took 3 OTC sleep aid pill's and entered this weird kinda dreamy/ghost state. it was just straight dissociation. got no clue what to do, DONT COLD TURKEY OFF ANYTHING OVER 20-30 GRAMS A DAY YOULL FUCKING REGRET IT)

&#x200B;

Im currently almost 4 month's clean. everything's great (jk) and i can deal with it, the diarrhea, then random constipation, then diarrhea, the weird greasy ass skin i have, the one sweaty armpit that sweats and smells like pure shit if i dont put on deodorant within a 10 min period after getting out of the shower, the random mood swings etc. I don't give a fuck. The only problem I seriously have is this weird dream state im in.

There is no way to explain this shit unless you've taken extremely high doses of kratom and get ""the eye wobbles"" where you almost partially trip into some weird Benadryl type state. I took 3-4 over the counter sleep aid pills too months ago when i tried withdrawal in the past (failed, kinda.) and it put me into that kind of weird trippy state just the same way but without the eye-wobbles part where your eyes fucking hurt bad and you're like dizzy and if you look right or left without turning your head it gest worse.

ANYONE FUCKING EXPERIENCED THIS SHIT?!?!?!?!

I've come off of like easily 80-100 grams a day for the last 6 months of taking it. Yes you don't have to tell me how retarbeb I am for chasing a high i knew i was never going to obtain without tolerance breaking. i get it, im retarbeb.Am i permanently fucked?

\*\*More Info Deeply Related:\*\*I was on a steady 30 grams a day diet for the first 2 years. Would wake up, eat cereal, take 10 grams, eat lunch, take 10, eat dinner, take 10, sleep, wake up, poop at the exact same times (i find holding in poop would fuck me up and not allow me to get high so it was essential to poop everytime in the morning right well anyways, youll see the relevance to that further down.)Well i quit for 30 days, and about 2 weeks in i literally remember almost crying on my porch when i realized ""i was fnially back to reality"" from that weird trippy state or something. like when i quit this veil was lifted and i was like holy shit i was never really here. anyways...i relapsed 30 days in

The following 3-6 months I would find myself taking upwards to 100-150 grams I swear to god, i literally was trying so hard to get high i just lived for MONTHS with permanent eye wobbles to the point where i almost crashed my car and i had quit my job said fuck it and cold turkeyed. I went 30 days again but my heartrate was like 200bpm 24/7 and every 15 minutes i would consciously have to breath, it felt like i had adrenal fatigue (i get it ""its not real"" well guess what, if its real, i sure as fuck had it) and nothing was getting better, i was in this permanent eye wobble state BAD it was so terrifying i would cry and panic like I was insane dude so i relapsed and took kratom again

The following 3-6 months after that im building up my dose again because im an addict and end up taking around 60-90 grams (usually towards 90) a day, yeah i get it im a retarb. and it saved me. the weird trippy state was not nearly as bad at all, it seemed as though as long as i was taking it/high i was ok living in that weird veil-over-my-eyes world (im talking about a legit veil like when you drink and your ""vision"" changes (not black out drunk but just a little buzz even)) i run out of money, and end up borrowing money from friends and shit and i feel super guilty about that and im not some crackhead that's just gonna keep borrowing until they take the responsbility for me and stop lending me money. so i borrow money from a few people which leads me into this position of rationing out my kratom right. so for the last month there i was taking 60 grams a day maybe, and every 2-3 days i would go 12 hours or sometimes a day without any, then i would find some way to sell something or find some money or some shit (not what you think, not crackhead style.) and rinse and repeat for about a month. This had to of helped me because i was basically not using for half a day ro a day every 3 days for a month. Then i just said fuck it and quit.

So here I am currently almost 4 months clean, but the weird psychosis shit, this like 4-benadryl-pills-""high"" or 3-sleep-aid-OTC-pills-""high"" is still here, and its decently strong, but NO WHERE near as strong as that last time. but it's still fucking here? LOL DUDE I can't open up a drawer full of random tools and odd objects for something that I KNOW is there, and find it. Like i just stare at it unable to ""see"" even though I can fucking clearly see. It's so god damn fucking weird.

*MY PERSONAL CONCLUSION IM ABOUT TO MAKE AFTER DOCTORS: It went away when i came off of 30 grams a day mind you just like the 2nd time that 30 grams was like 30 grams for 3 days then i had to find money somehow and would go 12-24 hours before i could get another 100 grams. did that for a few months actually. and i was totally cured and back to normal. 2nd time? 150 grams cold turkey? pure hell. 3rd time (current) 90 grams with days inbetween i would go 12-36 hours without any kratom for a month not completely pure hell. ------EVERY single time i came off of a taper or a lower dose the symptom was way reduced/less severe, or in the case of the first time actually went away. If i can't fix this im going to relapse back to 10 grams a day for a few months or something like that and then taper down over another few months to literally 1 gram or something becuase i literally have no clue what else to do and this is the last god damn thing i want to do because i probably won't be able to quit and i dont want to fight off urges trying to taper and all this shit. fucking shit m8.---------------------------------------------------------------- any thoughts k thanks*

But this is an awesome community with super supportive people which is amazing to see!

You can check out the ingredients, but all I can say is that it’s been a total game changer for my more acute phase of getting off this green sludge.. 

Like many of you who quit, or are considering quitting, I got sick and tired of woofing this shit down.. and although these past 5 days have suuucked.. it doesn’t even hold a candle to the nights of hell post opiate withdrawal.. nothing can touch the blinding inferno of hell that substance puts you through.. But the flavor is definitely the similar, but not as bad with Kratom.

All I know is that the last time I quite, on day 14 I felt like a brand new man.. which made it even more bitter when I decided to do it “one last time..” We all know there’s never “one last time” after convincing yourself to do it.. I am dooooone playing that game..

Holding the memory of my hellish experience getting off Kratom is what’s keeping me away from it.. but if you’re thinking about quitting, it IS manageable..

I succeeded for about 4-5 months, with a couple short relapses. The last one was a week or 2 ago, i took it for about a week at low amounts (2.5g was my last dose, still violently hurled it up). 

After having a terrifying panic attack and 3 days of absolute mental agony i decided i needed to quit again, as it would be much easier to quit after 1 week of use than 1 year. Although i am ashamed that i went back to it on and off the past month or so, i am glad i did. I remembered kratom with fondness and just remembered the good parts of using it. This last time, those good effects lasted a solid 2 days before making me go nuts. The first time i became dependent on kratom it took 2-3 months for the negative parts to kick in. I now know that my body will not tolerate it the way it used to, and how much mental and physical pain i go through both while on it and quitting it. Every time i relapsed, and the first time i quit back in July, i did it CT. Currently all withdrawal symptoms have ended since my last use of kratom was very short term and in low amounts. 

My only issue now is the feeling in me that i NEED some kind of mind altering substance to REPLACE the kratom. It doesnt matter if its kratom or not. Just something that affects my mind. In the past i have always needed some kind of crutch beginning at puberty. First it was self harm, then such a restricted vegan diet (became orthorexia, i was so obsessed with eating healthy that i refused to eat when no healthy vegan food was available, which was often as i was 14 and didnt have a job. Parents didnt support the veganism) that i became ill, then alcohol, then a relationship with a man MUCH older than me at 15, then opioid drugs, then benzos, and lastly kratom. 

Its such a strong desire to take something i know will end up ruining me. I do vape, but that isnt cutting it anymore since ive been vaping for so long and so often that i feel no affect from it, even with super high nicotine strengths. Its just a habit at this point, i can go an entire 6-7 hour workday without it. Its just a habit when im bored, driving, etc.

I attempted to use my small ativan prescription to get rid of it, but did not want to use all of the pills as i will need them in case of future panic attacks, and they dont give me a euphoric feeling unless i take an absurd amount, which I dont have access to, and when i did in the past i ended up blacking out completely. I drink a little bit now and then, but for some reason after my kratom issues alcohol barely affects me. I tested this about 5 months ago by taking 10 shots lf vodka, still 0 feeling of intoxication even though my calculated BAC was to the point of blackouts. I was completely conscious, walked straight, no vomiting, no passing out, and appeared 100% sober. 

The best i get is a lightheaded feeling that lasts about 30 mins, and even that takes so much vodka (usually drink vodka, since my alcohol dependence at 15 i cant stand tequila and other spirits)  that i get pain in my liver before i feel anything. This is the case for other substances as well, i just dont feel anything from them anymore. I drank on new year's and felt nothing. 

Now im stuck here with this nagging feeling that i need to take something, but know that if i do it will just be a replacement for the kratom and end in the same way, if not worse. Anyone else have this feeling? What do you do to get rid of it?",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.43483955}"

2021-01-05 10:33:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/kr0mik/day_7_rapid_taper_progress/,"Day 7, rapid taper. Progress.","Today I feel considerably better, but yesterday was probably the roughest day so far.  First day back at work - though, it served as a great distraction and I actually didn't really mind being there.

I was a 50ish gpd user (I've upped this since learning yesterday the tea I drank regularly from a local kava place has at least 10g/ea).

My rapid taper started at 9g/day, and I typically save 50pct to 74pct for right before bed, and I wait as long as I can stand before my first dose. I do this because, in my mind, the more I suffer through acute withdrawals on a daily basis, the faster my body gets used to very low levels of kratom, which should, hopefully, make my final jump off much easier.

I brought 0.8g to work, just in case. Around 1pm.. It was rough. The day before I had only 4.2g of kratom. Less than 10pct of my regular consumption. And that's down from 5g the day before, etc.  I had only half of that 0.8g and, while I didn't feel great, I made it through the day OK. I did drink one too many cups of coffee in the morning and that, I think, contributed to my issues.

I got home an ran 2 miles of interval sprints and really wore myself out. After that, around 6pm, I had 1g.  I cooked, cleaned, and went to the kava bar. Funny thing is, my friend is the bartender and he's struggled with kratom and he's around it all day.  Turns out, his boss strongly suggests to his own employees to not drink the kratom, but says nothing to his customers. I found that somewhat distasteful. Anyways, I had a good time there.   Had some kombucha with cbd and it may have helped. Came home, watched some bullshit on TV, and had 2.1g at 10pm.  Took some mitrazapine and melatonin and went to bed and slept for 7hrs, 1230am to 730am.

Today I feel pretty damn good actually. Tomorrow will be my last kratom day. I plan on having 1g at 6 after I exercise. And 2g before bed.

Tomorrow I'm just going to have 2g all day, and that'll be my last day with kratom. I probably will go through one night of shitty withdrawal symptoms, but after that I bet I'll be good. I could be completely wrong, but I'm pretty sure I've rapidly trained my body to accept lower kratom. I haven't had any real GI issues. Slight flank pain. Barely noticeable headaches, but an overall restlessness and craving for kratom, which is manageable.

I don't know if this approach would work for everyone but it seems like it's working great for me.

I CT 100 days ago.  Sorry I haven't been very active guys but honestly I can't be on the computer/phone much right now because of health reasons.  


I'm going to frame this in a way that I point out what I think worked, what didn't work and what worked against me.  


If you use supplements be careful and don't overwhelm yourself.  No supplement will cure acutes so just accept that you will feel like shit.  I fully support helper meds for first week though and think they are super helpful.  At this time my supplement stack is focused on vascular/cognative/anti aging stuff.  I'm off all dopamine supps anythinig for mood.  I honestly think they don't help much.  Taking care of myself and exercising, gettign sun, schedule, etc did more than any ""mood"" supplement.  


It was hell.  I'm not trying to scare y'all but if you are trying to quit accept it.  Some have pretty fucked up long term WD/PAWS.  The first month was basically a nightmare.    


I made things worse by using other drugs, particularly weed, like non stop.  I firmly believe it slowed my recovery to a crawl.  Once I quit the weed things were moving much more quickly.  


I wish I would have joined NA sooner.  It really helped me.  I know it's hella cheesy but it's better than active addiction and at this point I've quit everything, even nicotine without any assistance.(i mean chemical assistance like the patch)  


I got sick.  Honestly my body had some type of reaction to quitting or Kratom, I'll likely never know.  I'm still so glad to be quit.  I'm not gonna elaborate on my symptoms, I just can't talk about it anymore.  It does get better every day and I feel stronger than I have in years.  My mind is so clear at this point that I feel like an apex predator (compared to how I did feel).  


I view Kratom as super dangerous at this time, especially for daily use.  I fully support MMT to get off of it.  It's not even fully abotu the addiction anymore but what I've seen it can do to long term users.  It's a fucking dangerous ,DIRTY drug that hits all kinds of receptors.  Do whatever you can to get off.  


As for my life.  Things are so much better.  If you're reading this and want to quit and are scared - it takes a warrior stance.  Imagine yourself walking through the desert with no water for weeks.  That's what it's like.  You have to find a way to accept it and move  on.

Fortunately, I never had what I would call strong cravings. Lately, I've been reminded that we have to stay ever vigilant **no matter how long we've stayed quit** as very quick and sneaky fleeting thoughts of the typical ""Well, maybe some day..."" LIES have popped into my addict brain. Luckily, as soon as I recognize these thoughts I'm able to see them for the LIES they are, direct my attention to the TRUTH and go about my day doing something productive. **DO NOT hold onto or romanticize  these thoughts... these LIES!** A single thought can develop into an obsession (craving), which can lead to relapse. I don't ever want to use kratom again. EVER! We must remain forever vigilant if we want to STAY QUIT for good. Participating in this great subreddit is just one of the ways I do that.

I’m not a heavy user. Took about 2.7 grams. As you can imagine it wore off fairly quickly. Usually within 2 hours. 

After the 2 hours wear off what I realized was that kratom makes you crave strange things. Very self destructive things such as fast food, alcohol and just overall things that shoot up your dopamine for a short period of time. 

I’m very active and eat a healthy low carb diet when I was off the kratom. When I was back on it for those 3 days I found my self eating bread, sweets, drinking soda and just overall destroying my self without any regard. It’s as if my body was trying to get that feel good rush through any means necessary. I’m off kratom for a few days now and everything went back to normal. No more strange cravings or impulses. 

Overall the 4 months off kratom taught me what real life is. What a normal clean person feels. And it’s so much better than what this plant makes you feel for a very short while.

Usually I go visit my parents and extended family during the holidays but this year nobody was visiting anyone given the COOF.  Naturally the lack of human interaction leads to boredom, loneliness, and temptations. 

I almost gave into a temptation that I stupidly set myself up for after my quit on October 4th of 2020.  My addict brain told me to save a few capsules of Kratom for a rainy day, which I kept in a little green bottle.  I had about 20 grams of 500mg capsules sitting in a drawer waiting for an opportunity for a mental slip up. Just incase I found the need to hem my vagina in a moment of weakness.  

I was invited to a small new years Eve gathering with one of my closest friends.  I made the fateful decison NOT to consume any of my rainy day kratom.  I went to dinner had the obligatory new years toast and drank coffee the rest of the night.  

The next morning I woke up feeling great.  Knowing that I had just trained my mind to reject what's easy and comfortable and to enjoy situations organically.  Another arrow in my quiver in the battle against temptation.   

I dumped that bottle in the toilet during my new years  morning piss.  I feel fine.",20,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.46302107}"

Day 19 update. Today I went back to work after basically taking off the last 2.5 weeks.  I told the people I work with that it was a rough year and i really needed sometime to relax and refocus for the new year.  Everyone was understanding and likely felt the same and luckily no one bothered me for that period.  

I had a pretty productive day.  Was working by 8 A.M. and even now by 6 P.M. I am still doing some work.  I was able to focus pretty good for most of the day.  I can definitely say I am not 100%, but I think for day 19 im pretty happy with my progress. 

Did a 30 minute core workout this afternoon and looking forward to a good dinner.

As a woman this was extremely overwhelming and stressful, so I just wanted to let you all know that at least in my experience, it will come back!! I do take multivitamins and use minoxidil, but I have always used those (since taking k). The only thing that finally made a difference was cutting out the kratom.

I could really use prayers to finally jump off, as I'm long overdue and quite frankly terrified. The RLS is the absolute worst for me, and as someone who made it through 45 days of methadone wd, Im not sure why this is so scary to me, but it sure as hell is.

 I was a little restless going to sleep and after a late night (1230am) 2.5mg of melatonin I finally fell asleep.  I had crazy, crazy dreams all night, but much moreso towards the early morning, around 6am.

I woke up well rested and felt pretty good. I was a little groggy, but not nearly as bad as when I'd drink boatloads of kratom the night before.

I'm back at work today at my software desk job. Locked myself out of all my accounts because I forgot my passwords over the break, so sitting on our helpdeks line for 2hrs to start the day was... Annoying.

I'm starting to feel the effects of withdrawal, it's 11am.  It's not unbearable. I had some black seed oil this morning but that's it. I have a lot to do at work and I can surprisingly focus. I wish I had only one cup of coffee instead of two. I'm feeling pretty restless. Brought 0.7g with me to work just in case I feel awful, but as of right now I can stand the feeling.

All-in-all, I barely had any kratom yesterday, and I'll have less today. Very manageable approach to quitting this stuff is a rapid taper, in my anecdotal opinion. It's hard to be disciplined, of course, because if we all were, we wouldn't be addicted to kratom.

Anyways, hope everyone is doing well. I'm really looking forward to leaving work and getting some exercise this evening. Wednesday is my last day having kratom forever. I'll be glad when this is done.

There's a lot of posts on this site about people in misery. If I went CT I'd be right there along with you. If you're really worried, try this aggressive style taper. It's not even 10pct as bad as when I went CT. I might be delaying the inevitable and may regret these worlds Thursday night, we shall see.

We’ve used K to ween other dependencies and the realization that’s there’s not another substance coming after makes quitting it feel like too much for some. We’re all used to feeling some form of high and have simply traded one addiction for another.  If you can make it through the first week the physical symptoms will 100% disappear. This 2nd week has been more about starting to feel emotions and playing the mind game against the Kratom adversary. This is from someone with a roughly 90GPD habit. Cliché but my best advice is to drink lots of water, take vitamins, drink coffee to keep going in the mornings and set a positive tone for the day. Perhaps even better advice although not everyone can do it is just go away from your comfort zone where you normally use and where K is inaccessible for a couple of weeks. Sleep is the hardest part for me but it’s coming slowly. I’ve learned to appreciate sleeping when I’m actually tired after a long day of walking and working and not tossing and turning. Those messy nights keep me motivated to not go back. Don’t give up hope just because you long for a buzz. There are different healthier ways to achieve a dopamine rush and you will notice them as soon as you quit. The little pleasures in life are FAR more rewarding once you can feel again.

Second is, due to the current lockdown, you will be tempted to lean into something else. Lean into this sub. Otherwise you’re back at square one. Finally, love yourself.

Now the real works begins, addressing issues that motivated me to hind behind the mask of kratom. The good part of getting off kratom again is I get to feel. The bad part of kratom is I get to feel. Feelings, although overwhelming at times, are not fact. We are not our past. We are not out emotions.

As painful as it is to feel in full, I'll take that over the haze. Such a ball and chain to be dependent on it. It was like this timer for me. I knew that I'd feel kinda okay for an hour, then by hour 3 or 4 I'd be getting anxiety, depression, chills, diarrhea, and mood swings that could rival roid rage. I was always thinking about it.

Saw another post talking about exercise is key and I wanted to talk about that today.  I see a lot of people looking for other medications to help them feel better when they get off of Kratom. I completely understand helper meds to get through the acutes, but ultimately 100% sobriety is going to be best (I understand people with underlying conditions need other medications). Since day 3 I have been exercising every day for basically two weeks straight.  For days 3-10 the hour or two after exercising I felt almost completely fine.  When you are deep in the acutes even just an hour of feeling better can get you through that entire day. I also believe the exercise has helped a lot with the RLS and sleep.  Ive been sleeping basically fine since day 11.  Even days 6-10 I was sleeping, but not great.  

Now on day 18 I feel pretty good. Not 100%, but for day 18 I am way ahead of where I thought I would be.  This afternoon i ran 6+ miles and felt great.  

If you can get out of bed or off the couch and do even 2 minutes of exercise.  I promise it will help. 

On another note I have been very easy on myself since day 1 off kratom.  I have done minimal work and just been good to my body and mind.  Well tomorrow day 19 I will be going back full force to start the year.  I think I feel good enough and hopefully can find the motivation to work the full day.  Time to start the new year strong.

I had 35 days off kratom before relapse for a weeks use. So now 14 days off again and staying off. 

I realize kratom is like opioid but shouldn't symptoms ease up by now.  I thought u just go through some horrible stuff then it gets better so WHY IS IT NOT EASING UP? 

I've been laying on a couch for the last 2 weeks. I took all that time off work. Christmas and new years on couch. I have to go back to work tomorrow.

Perhaps I thought I could figure this out on my own but the truth is I feel very alone in my struggles. 

I've been using kratom just over 1 year now and, more than anything, I just want to be done with it. I'm only 22 and I'm still finishing school and I feel like a lot is on the line. All I want to do is better myself, both physically and mentally, but I've realized some time ago that kratom is getting in the way of that. I thought for a long time that kratom was helping me in several was, especially with social anxiety. At this point, however, I've come to realize that it has made me extremely antisocial (perhaps the pandemic exacerbated this). It's like I have no desire to make new human connections and, outside of my family, I'm rather afraid of forming bonds.

I could go on and on about the reasons why I want to be off of this drug and I think we can all agree that there are plenty of them. My main issue is that I'm beyond terrified of quitting and 80% of that terror has to do with the acute WD phase. I tried one time, by myself, to quit CT and it was agonizing; I broke within a day (partially due to anxiety). I'm coming to you guys for help because I don't know what to do. My dilemma is that my habit is pretty bad, I take kratom rather frequently (every 3-4 hours unless I'm sleeping) and in relatively large doses. In total, I believe I consume 60 GPD.

My biggest fear is that I'm consuming so much that a CT detox, even in a clinic and under care, will be excruciating. If I was only consuming 15 GPD, I believe I would admit myself in a heartbeat. My current plan is to taper down to a smaller GPD consumption and then possibly seek inpatient. Then, of course, my fear is that I'll just be prolonging the inevitable.

I'm very grateful and lucky that my family would be in full support of me seeking an inpatient detox and it is an option. I'm just afraid that my habit is so extreme that, even under medical care and symptom relieving treatment, it'll be agonizing and maybe it's better to try and get myself down a bit before going for that. I'm not sure what to do. 

Has anyone here experienced a detox within a clinic/inpatient care? Anyone with a habit of 60 GPD or more? 

I would like to note that if I end up seeking inpatient care, I would be interested in staying for awhile (college is still remote so that would be possible) and I would also be interested in outpatient groups, afterwards, if needed.

Thanks so much for any advice, I could use it.",8,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5953478}"

Well this Medication is also used for opioid addicts. It fills the same sensors so if you were to take an opioid you wouldn’t feel anything and therefore makes you less motivated to use, because you won’t feel the euphoria, you can’t , it’s blocked. 

Now here is where I messed up. I was told many many times and read for myself that you can absolutely not take this until opioid is out of your system, or about 7 days. Oh cool I thought, I don’t use drugs anymore. Sure I was Kratom but that’s “different”. Well it’s fucking not. I went to extreme precipitated withdrawal and was screaming in pain, praying for death, telling my husband I’m going to the ER it’s over. It was the worst thing that ever happened to me. Within 20 minutes I was laying in the bathroom. I was up all night with anxiety, climbing walls, the most extreme RLS I have ever seen. I was screaming and crying.

Never ever do that

My dad pretty much disowned me for missing christmas, last thing he's said to me was fuck you you fucking junkie and how he doesn't want me around anymore (start of day 7). Around day 11 I woke up to a sick 1 year old. Me personally I was feeling good and wanted to get stuff done. The next day at work noticed sysmtoms not related to WD and I'm pretty sure I have some sort of cold. Have a cough (sometimes dry sometime not), sneezing, congestion and ear popping and that's about it. It could sound like WD but it all started with my 1 year old. Then my wife started getting the sniffles and now my mother in law (baby sitter) is congested. I'm afraid were just gonna keep giving it back and forth. The bright side is I'm on day 15 off that sludge. I no longer have to wake up and stomach it just to function. I feel free. Strangely enough, I have zero temptation for k. I go to the gas stations and see it and have no craving. So that's nice. Honestly if it wasn't for this cold I think I'd be almost back to normal. Not mental games besides the occasional feeling of lethargy. But this quit has made me realize I'd been living in lethargy the whole time and just use kratom to take my mind off of the fact I'm a piece of shit on it.  More motivated and clear headed then ever. To anyone on the dark day 3-6, it does get better. And it happens rather quick if you ask me. At least in hinde sight.

Looking for some guidance. So I am a long term (15+ years) on again off again opiate addict. Close to three years ago I had a pretty gnarly fentanyl overdose. I had been using kratom occasionally but after my overdose it was a God-send in that it helped me get through the heroin/fentanyl withdrawals as well as helping me to manage cravings. Eventually, in what I'm sure is an all too familiar trajectory, I started using it more frequently and in increasing dosages. These last few years I have had a ""harm reduction"" type approach to it. And while I was somewhat uncomfortable in being dependent upon it, in comparison to heroin addiction it was a walk in the park. Since Covid, my mental health has been in a pretty steady decline which culminated in a one day relapse on heroin. After taking stock of my habits and patterns I have come to the conclusion that it is time to end this dependency. I have gotten to the point of drinking around 40-60 grams a day split between 2-3 doses. I am the type that likes to go into the early stages of withdrawal before dosing. So generally I don't take my first dose until well into the day. Usually around 5pm. I believe I do this in that it most closely resembles using opiates. I enjoy the relief of waiting until yesterday's dose has left my body before experiencing the stimulating euphoric rush brought on by a first dose. I have other ""kraddict"" friends who dose first thing in the morning and drink small doses throughout the day. This never appealed to me in that I like feeling it hit me strong. 

So last week I attempted a fairly rapid taper. The first day drank 30g, the following day 20g, then 10g, with the goal being off it completely by the 4th day. Well it didn't pan out so well. I made it to 8 pm or so before impulsively ""pouring up"" with a 30ish gram dose. Then again yesterday I attempted to go without it and got till 10pm before again caving. So I'm looking for some guidance. Does anyone have thoughts on trying a longer taper and perhaps switching up the frequency of my does. Perhaps dosing first thing in the morning with a smaller dose and following up with 3 equal size doses? And maybe lower my dose every week as opposed to every day? Any thoughts y'all could offer would be greatly appreciated. I apologize if this isn't standard reddit posting ettiequte as I am new to the platform. Very inspiring reading some of your stories. While it has at times been fun watching the perplexed faces of friends/co-workers watching me chug this mysterious green/brown drink it is also a lonely life being a ""kraddict"" in that most people haven't heard of it even in the Recovery community.

I've been off of kratom for about 2.5 months now (ct sober date from 25 ish gpd for 3 years is 10.15.2020)  and I am really having a hard time. I thought I would feel amazing by now. This is not the case. For the first time since I quit, lately I've been seriously considering going back. I was happier, a better wife and mother, more productive, thinner (I've gained about ten pounds since quitting), actually felt excited about things. I am so dull and lifeless now, I feel like a slug. I was not this way before I started using- I picked up kratom to treat anxiety that I didn't want to treat with prescription meds, because I went down that road in the past and it did not go well.Initially kratom worked miracles it seemed like, until things started to get dark and the dependency kicked in. My digestive system is still a mess. I'm more depressed than I've been in a long long time. I don't \*want\* to go back- I was having some really alarming physical symptoms that finally motivated my quit- hearing damage being a major one, I had super alarming tinnitus that is now almost entirely gone (loud, metallic sounds in my ear when I would speak and constant wompwompwomp type of noises otherwise)- tingling hands and feet- throbbing nerves in my mouth- waking up in withdrawal every day. I don't miss that, it was fucking horrible. But I do miss being a more useful human and I wonder if I'll ever get back there. Any encouragement would be great.

I owe you all a debt of gratitude. I wanted to share my story in the hope that it may help others. 

Today I'm 10 weeks CT from an 8 year habit (50-60 gpd at its height). I'll start with my key takeaways for how to survive the process and then move on to my story for those who may be interested.

1. *Time off from work*. I took a week off when I did my CT (9 days total) and I was not functional during that time. I wasn't ready to go back to work at the end of the 9 days, but I had to. I wish I'd had 2 weeks off. I suggest taking a week off if you possibly can. If you have been taking kratom for a significant length of time, consider taking more than a week off if you can.
2. *High dose vitamin C*. There are research studies showing that high doses of C leading up to CT and over the first few days of CT substantially relieve acute physical opiate withdrawal symptoms. I followed the protocol below (see the very end of this post). I stopped using the C on day 5 or 6 of CT and was thrown back into extreme acute w/d. Then I resumed the C and the w/d symptoms were alleviated. As a result, I recommend using the C for at least 7-10 days after CT and then weaning off the C gradually.
3. *Amino acid therapy.* Your neurochemical balance is thrown into chaos when you stop using kratom. Certain combinations of amino acids and vitamins/minerals provide the building blocks for your body to manufacture neurotransmitters to help bridge the gap until your brain's natural balance returns. I relied on the amino acid protocols in the book ""End Your Addiction Now"" by Gant and Lewis. The book outlines specific supplement routines to support neurotransmitter function. I used the routines for GABA, serotonin, and endorphin production and it was a game changer. During my taper (leading up to CT), I had severe anxiety and panic attacks. However, the anxiety almost completely disappeared within days of beginning the GABA routine from this book. I highly recommend it.   
4. *Unisom SleepTabs* (doxylamine succinate) for insomnia. This is the only OTC sleep aid that worked for me. \*Don't take Benadryl (diphenhydramine HCI) because it can make restless leg syndrome worse.  
5. *Wim Hof breathing and cold therapy*. My anxiety spiked through the roof when I needed to go back to work on day 10 of my CT. I was coming unglued the night before I went back. Out of sheer desperation, I tried the Wim Hof breathing method for beginners (can be found on You Tube), because people on this forum had recommended it. It was a miracle. I used it 3 times a day over that first week - each session is just 10 minutes - and it knocked my anxiety down by 80% or more and was integral to helping me function at work. I've continued using it at least once a day. About 9 weeks into my CT, I finally started experimenting with the second half of the Wim Hof method, which is cold therapy, by taking cold showers. I think it has been very helpful and I highly recommend it. I wish I had started it sooner.
6. *Guided brainwave meditation*s from iAwake Technologies. I found these when I was trying to quit drinking several years ago and they were very helpful with quitting both alcohol and kratom. They're audio tracks with sound frequencies that simulate the deep brain states you enter during meditation (alpha, theta, delta). It's worth checking out if this kind of thing appeals to you.
7. *Pre-measuring your doses.* If you taper, try pre-measuring doses into individual baggies in advance. I found that this trick really helped me stick to my taper compared to having to measure out each dose in the moment, and constantly facing the temptation to add a little something extra. 
8. *Be patient.* I'm 70 days into my CT and it's been a fucking rollercoaster. Everyone says recovery from kratom is non-liner, and my god, that is so true. Expect to be up and down - especially if you get PAWS. You'll think you're coming out of it and returning to normal, and then the rug will be pulled out from under you and you'll feel horrendous again. Just stick with it. Over time, things will get better. Have faith and don't give up!    

*How did I get here?*

I'm in my 30s and have no history of opioid use prior to kratom. I found kratom in 2012 when I was looking for alcohol substitutes - I was a heavy drinker and hoped to find a legal high to take the place of booze. I started using kratom and it didn't take long for it to become an everyday thing. For years I used it only in the evening. However, my dose crept up from 5 g initially to 10 g, 15 g, etc. You know the story. 

When I finally quit drinking for good in 2018, my kratom use skyrocketed. I started using it multiple times each day. Soon I was dosing 5-6+ times a day and getting intense cravings and w/d symptoms after 2-3 hours from my last dose. My daily consumption was 30-40 grams for years. At the height of my use, I was consuming around 50-60 gpd (about a pound a week). 

*Why did I decide to quit, and why CT instead of taper?* 

Over time, I developed numerous severe side effects that I attribute to kratom. Here are just a few. Significant memory loss; substantial decline in cognitive function; excessive sweating, including drenching night sweats every night; total loss of libido; loss of all ambition and dreams; loss of emotion (I became a zombie); loss of personality/wit/sense of humor; depersonalization - inability to connect with loved ones; anxiety and panic attacks; depression; insomnia; frequent urination; opioid tolerance (when I was injured and prescribed an Rx opioid, I realized I had developed a massive cross-tolerance with ""real"" opioids). To add insult to injury, kratom was expensive. I hated being a slave to it. I had lost my dreams; all I did was get through the day until my next dose. Kratom was like a parasite that had completely taken over my life. I was still functioning at work, but the rest of my life was in shambles.    

I tried to quit kratom for years. I successfully stopped CT back in 2016 for about 3 weeks, but the PAWS were horrendous and I started using again due to severe depression, anxiety, anhedonia, and lack of motivation. Over the last 2-3 years, I attempted many slow tapers, believing this might help avoid some of the horrors of PAWS. However, it always got hard when my daily dose dropped under 20 gpd. I couldn't seem to go any farther. This year I managed to taper all the way down to 15 gpd. I was going pretty slow, dropping 1/4 gram each day. Nonetheless, I still got w/d symptoms so severe during the taper that I could no longer function well at work. I work in a professional field and need my brain to function at a high level, but during my taper, I had severe brain fog and literally couldn't retain information. It felt like my memory card had been wiped. So I gave up on the taper and upped my kratom dose. My brain function improved immediately, but my tapering progress was lost. I got fed up and decided I couldn't live like this anymore. I decided to take a week off work and go CT. I jumped CT from 20-25 gpd. 

*Acute Withdrawal*

I believe my vitamin C and amino acid protocols made acutes much more bearable than they would have otherwise been. However, it was still hell. My acutes started right away on day 1. Here's what I experienced during days 1-8 (in varying degrees of severity, with different symptoms hitting at different times): worst headache and hangover feeling with intense brain fog; sweating; chills (I even had severe chills in a hot bath); total loss of appetite; insomnia; crippling fatigue (I'm a fit person, but I found it completely exhausting to climb the stairs in my house or take a shower and dry/dress myself afterward); restless leg syndrome; severe body ache (my bones hurt). I basically laid on the couch watching TV for 8-9 days and slept when I could - it was all I could do. I started getting over the acutes around day 8, but I continued to have aspects of acute w/d up to day 21. It came and went.

*Post-Acute Withdrawal Syndrome*

I know that not everyone gets PAWS. However, I did. Today is day 70 and I still have it, although I'm starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. My PAWS symptoms have included anxiety, depression, hopelessness/despair, cravings, anhedonia, insomnia, and overwhelming fatigue. I won't sugarcoat it - there have been times when I didn't know if I was going to make it through this. It's been positively brutal. However, I've stuck it out, and I see progress over time. I've gradually started to take interest in my life again. Without any particular effort, I've been naturally attracted to taking better care of myself and nurturing my hobbies. I've been working out, eating better, reading, and playing my guitar. I'm starting to feel my emotions again. I'm starting to have hope for the future. 

Recovery from addiction is the hero's journey. Good luck to you!

Day 17 update and feeling pretty good.  Today was a good day spent with family.  Had some great food and didn't really think much about kratom withdrawal for the first time in 2.5 weeks. Almost considered not posting today, but I want to keep the journal for myself and those who are looking to quit.  

I did get some thoughts today about using kratom and harder opiates.  I am not acting on any of these thoughts, but they are important to talk about.  Now that im feeling good my brain is saying you can just do a small amount it wont hurt you. Its amazing how recently I was in the depths of withdrawals and already my brain is trying to convince me its ok.  I can do anything I want except for 1 thing and my brain tells me to do that 1 thing. The pull of addiction is a whole other beast compared to acutes, but today i stayed strong. 

Stuck to my workout routine today did a 3 mile run and then took a nice hot bath.  I've been very good to myself in regards to exercise and relaxing the last 10 days which I think has helped a lot.  At this point ive been off all helper meds for 12 days as well.

* Sneezing 
* Slight RLS (only effects me at like 6 A.M. after a full nights sleep)

Started off using it occasionally but then it became an everyday thing. My city actually has the most kava/kratom bars of anywhere in the U.S. so kratom is easily accessible, and bought (in tea form) like it's coffee. It's everywhere. I know people that drink it like water, and I've even had a couple years where it was practically all I drank. Anyway.. I've quit before, for a few months, and then ended up going back. Now I'm quitting for good. Obviously I'm not going to quit CT.. I am tapering over the next week and hopefully should be completely off in a week.

My reason for quitting: started having anxiety and panic attacks, as well as other weird symptoms like chronic headaches and dissociative/derealization feelings. There aren't really any specific triggers so I believe it's related to kratom. Had tons of tests done, all blood work came back fine - although an adrenal test showed adrenal dysfunction (overactive adrenals/adrenal exhaustion)

Also, I should mention - I own a cafe and we serve it.. which makes this harder. The past year or so I've been really contemplating no longer serving it. For a long time though, I saw it as no worse than coffee - and just another tea. But now seeing the problems it's caused for people, I don't want to be selling something that can cause harm. The problem is, a huge amount of our sales comes from it. In fact, if we stopped selling it right now, I'm not sure we'd even be able to stay in business. So I'm in the process of trying to figure that out as well. But that's another story.

I went all day yesterday without anything and had cold sweats, barely slept and so uncomfortable. I drank hot tea all day which helped a bit but felt like a bad flu where I could barely walk. 
I decided today to taper down to one capsule pill for the next few days. I start a new job Tuesday and am terrified I wont be able to make it without this taper.

2nd day of 23.1g. Now enjoying periods where I can easily pass the 2.5 hour threshold without feeling WD’s. My emotional stability is so steady.

2021-01-02 18:28:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/kp8fu8/a_very_hard_lesson/,A Very Hard Lesson,"I thought I had learned it back in 2012 when I finally quit drinking, cigarettes and weed.  For several years I was really living my best life - got so much accomplished, it still amazes me to this day.

Fast forward several years, allowed marijuana back in my life and was still abusing my monthly script of Norco.  I maintained this cycle of weed everyday and blowing through my monthly script in 5-6 days, then dealing with mild withdraws for 2-3 days.  Did this every month for several years, then I found kratom to erase the withdraws from the Norco.  That started a 2.5 year addiction to kratom, along with the weed and Norco.  And overtime, it just wore me down - the mental and physical anguish every f'in day!  Like carrying a gorilla on your back.  

So I tried several times in 2019 to get off the kratom, but it was incredibly hard with my stressful work and life in general, so when Covid hit and I got to work from home, I was determined to get off it and clean up my life.  So after a short taper, I finally quit Kratom on Jun 5, 2020 and stayed off it for almost 90 days, then all HELL BROKE LOOSE!

During those 3 months, I was exercising almost daily but still using marijuana (first mistake) and then ended up really hurting my back and refilling my Norco script (second huge mistake).  Well damn near within a week or two later, my mother suddenly fell ill and after 50+ days in the hospital she passed on November 3rd. It shook me to the core.  My mother was my everything.  A part of me died with her, for sure.

While she was hospitalized, and for almost two months after her death, ALL MY DEMONS came back full force.  I had left the addiction door open and when this ""life storm"" hit, it just blew me away.  I couldn't stand to feel anymore pain and my addict brain took over from there.  What I would do now to have those days back again while my mother was still living.....smh.

Life only gets harder as you get older.  And if you have an addiction(s) dragging you down, the suffering we inevitably endure navigating through life is exponentially worse.  The roller coaster of emotions, physical pain and feeling like shit, guilt ridden all the time knowing you're hurting yourself and wasting your precious time on this earth chasing highs - not to mention all the money and energy that's expended on something that adds no real value to your life and eventually robs you of your true self.

You must stay strong this time.  You've cleaned the slate of everything now, so do the work.  You know it will NEVER EVER GET EASIER than this moment in time.  The lessons just gets tougher and tougher each time you relapse and try to quit again.  Make this the last time.  You've longed for many years to get back to where you were in 2012-2015.  You know how beautiful and awesome life was once you shutdown the addict and closed that door, then the whole freaking world opened up for you like an oyster.  

NEVER FORGET how precious your sobriety is to you given your addictive personality - you are your own worst enemy when it comes to mind altering substances.  And if you forget this and give it an ""inch"", the addict in you will no doubt TAKE YOUR LIFE away again.  And you don't have time to allow it to sweep you away for another 5 years only to deal with being in this place again (with more storms to come) and undoubtedly it will only get harder to quit again.  

Love yourself and the incredibly unique and beautiful creature you are.  Breath this life in deeply, without anything to cloud it, for it will soon wind down and the regrets you're dealing with now will seem like child's play if you relapse again.",61,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6838778}"

My QuittingKratom story after reading this sub for a year now.,"Hey guys! Been following this sub for a while now. A little history: I get bad migraines and headaches which OTC meds don’t do squat for. Saw a doctor in 2016 who prescribed me Tylenol 3s. They worked! In 2017 I moved and saw another doctor who basically gave me a Rx for Sumatriptan (Imitrex) for my migraines and it was liquid gold. But I kept taking the T3s daily for my daily tension headaches. He wouldn’t prescribe them anymore by April 2019, which was fine. I sought out a more natural alternative and found Kratom. I only ever did 3-5 grams per dose up to three times per day everyday until a few days ago when I ran really short. Because of this oopsie I am just doing 1.4g per dose, 3 times per day. I realized something: I need to quit this crap! So I am! I will keep doing the 1.4g/dose/3x daily for about a week then gradually decreasing to two doses then to once daily to finish on January 30th. Since the rapid decrease I have felt sluggish with lots of body pains and the cravings SUCK! But it’s awesome knowing I have a finite amount left and I can’t just dose to feel better! My third dose is in an hour and it’s not too bad maybe I will skip it! Kratom was definitely helpful to get me off of T3s. Now back to normal in a month.

I had a habit of 35 grams per day for 2 years. I have been using suboxone to quit kratom. I took my first dose of 4 mgs suboxone on monday at 12pm. I had originally planned to start at a single dose of 4mgs in the morning only, and taper down over the course of 5 days and jump today, six days into my quit. I woke up today with no intentions of taking any sub. I have tapered down to 1 mg once a day in the morning when i get up. I thought today would be a good day to jump because ive noticed ive felt a little better than the day before when i wake up each day. About 2 hours after i woke up today i felt the WD's creep in and they were WAY more severe than i expected for day 6, so i ended up taking a 1 mg dose of sub. I guess my plan now is going to be to continue my sub taper down from 1 mg over the next few days and try to make the jump again. Ive never tried to quit kratom before so i dont know what a good day to jump would be, or what a quit timeline even looks like.. I just assumed it would be similar to any other opiate WD i have been through. I have quit H and oxys before so i know that on day 5 or 6 i noticed the physical WD's get way better so i was very shocked at how bad i felt today. Does any one have any idea of what would be a good plan from here? Like what would be a good day to jump off the sub? I plan to try to taper it to half a mg over the next 2 days and reassess. Im a little scared that ive only made the situation worse by taking the sub and when i quit the sub in a couple of days ill essentially just be starting from day one. Any response would be helpful.

Luckily my situation never became as dire as some of the other unfortunate souls who became slaves to this stuff for far longer than my one year (my heart goes out to all of you), and I'm grateful that at this point I've already gone through the worst of my journey and that kratom has largely been out of my mind the past couple of days. No more feverish nights, no more jolts shooting throughout my body, and no more laying in bed experiencing crippling physical and emotional pain. Though I am experiencing residual restless arms and legs, elevated anxiety/irritability, some brain fog and some fatigue, I can say that overall I'm feeling far more alive than I was before I quit. I can feel my body producing its own endorphins when I lie back and listen to a David Bowie record, knowing kratom had no role.

So really, all has been going pretty well these past couple of days, though today I am confronted with something that I feel could knock down everything I've built in an instant- four ounces of SGM I ordered prior to quitting came in the mail today. Rather than tossing outright it like part of me is thinking I should've, in a display of almost animalistic conditioning I proceeded to open the bag up and put it in the cigar box where I would always keep the stuff. The smell of fish and green tea was as disgusting as it was nostalgic. Instantly, thoughts of *""Just one cup of tea won't hurt""* and *""It'll be fine if I just use it every once in a while""* intruded my previously clear head.

I'm feeling a bit anxious about it and I'm having some cravings that for now I feel like I can still resist, and for now the kratom is just sitting in the box. I've made a deal with myself in hopes of ensuring that it will remain there and only there until I hear what some of you guys have to say, since at the moment I'm experiencing some substantial self doubt. Additionally, I have some questions for some of you who have been here or perhaps experienced something similar:

1. Since I didn't get the chance to taper much and am still experiencing some withdrawal symptoms, should I start tapering now or am I probably close enough to the end as to where PAWS isn't really something I have to worry about?
2. If tapering isn't a good idea at this point, should I just get rid of the kratom or keep it around in case I have a valid use for it in the future or is that too dangerous in your experience?
3. Excluding psychological dependence, if I took just a single dose, would it set me back in terms of physical withdrawal or would I be right where I was before once it wore off?

I really appreciated the support and encouragement I got from you guys in my last post and I wish I could be spreading positivity again in this post, but just having this stuff around is really fucking with me and I'm scared that if I toss it I'll really regret it. Regret is what killed me in my previous attempts at quitting. If you got here, I'm grateful simply for the fact that you've listened, and if you have any advice at all I'm all ears.

**Edit:** Thank you all for your advice. It took a bit of effort but I went out back and lit it on fire and my only regret is even considering taking another dose. I feel like I'm back on track.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.47451097}"

Opiates for me always gave me motivation and made me happy after I stopped getting them, my withdrawals were so bad that the only relief I got was to sit in the shower.  I researched anything I could to not feel this for another minute and I came across kratom.  My first dose made me feel so much better, and made me feel even better than opiates bc it didn't hurt my stomach afterwards.  I found out I was pregnant 8 weeks ago and I was told to do a taper as I did.  Before I found out I was close to 70-80gpd and I also did extracts which is horrible.

2021-01-02 11:21:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/kp08rw/day_4_aggressive_taper/,"Day 4, aggressive taper","I was a 30-50ish gpd user for years (3+).  I started at 9g on day 1 and have been on 6g for days 2-3, today is day 4 and I'm going to drop to 5.5g today.  One way or the other, I'm jumping off completely on thursday night, which will be my last and final dose of kratom, forever.

I've felt remarkably well, actually.  I've been staying very busy between hanging out with my son, playing with my dogs, going to the beach, doing housework, and working out. Probably the exercise is helping me the most.  I'm a little concerned today because I guess I destroyed my legs yesterday in a kettlebell workout - and I probably can't work out today very hard.  I might do some yoga and some bodyweight exercising just to get the blood flowing and help recovery.  The last time I quit using an aggressive taper, exercise was the single most beneficial thing that I could do.

So far my sleep hasn't been too bad.  I typically split my doses 25%, 25% and 50%, saving the largest dose for right before bed so I can get decent sleep.  Unfortunately, last night, I had my final dose at 11pm and stayed up reading until 1am and was feeling pretty restless.  I was able to get a little sleep but woke up at 1:45am wide awake and very, very restless.  I took a melatonin, a very low dose of mitrazipine (which I was prescribed for insomnia related to PTSD) and some naproxen, got up and cleaned my kitchen for 15 minutes, then laid back down and did a little guided medication via a sleep app and slept from 3ish until 930am.  Not too bad.

Right now I don't feel super great.  But I refuse to give in immediately to the kratom upon waking.  I like to push that first dose as far as I can, so today I'm going to wait until at least 1pm, maybe even 2pm, to take that first dose.  I have a little body ache, stomach feels ... off, and feel very restless - but the restlessness isn't terribly uncomfortable.  It's more like energetic, so I'm going to go to home depot and buy some hedges I've been meaning to plant, do some grocery shopping, and see how I feel.

All-in-all, as long as I can keep getting 5-6hrs of sleep, I'll be fine. 

I highly recommend the aggressive taper.  It gives your body a couple of days to re-orient itself to a lower dose without the terrible, awful days 2-4 of cold turkey.  I did this once before in the summer and quit for 6 weeks and it was a little easier than this time - only because I was working out regularly and heavily and was able to really wear myself out on a daily basis.

I'll never, ever touch kratom again after this.  I am very resentful that I listened to the hype and bullshit from the vendors, that I didn't do adequate research, and, ultimately, that even though I knew early on  I was becoming addicted, I chose the kratom feeling over stability.  Kratom caused (well, I caused by using kratom) a lot of problems in my life.  A lot of laziness, lack of motivation, poor performance at work, and definitely played a role in my recent divorce. It's time to face life with a clear mind.  I went through a deep and dark time with alcoholism after I got out of the military before I finally got the courage to go AA and get some help.  I'd encourage anyone struggling with addiction of any sort to go to NA or AA.  It literally saved my life.  I go on a regular basis, 3 years later, and always feel much better when I leave.

I wanted to give insight to those in my shoes. I used kratom to quit drinking....3 years ago. Started 3gs once a day, but over the years, I got up to about 10gs 3x a day. My heaviest use was for about a year. I stopped measuring until I Decided to quit. Tried cold turkey, didn't last 24 hours... So I decided to taper. I have not felt physical WDs at all so far and I've dropped down to under 16gs a day (almost 50% drop!). Every week, I'll drop 1g until I'm down to about 4gs a day... Then I'll cold turkey it. This is how I'm going about it:
1) I don't take any in the am anymore. 
2)at about 1pm, I take 5-6gs and at 9-10 I take the rest for the day so I can sleep. Every week I will take a half gram off each dose.
3)I keep an excel spreadsheet to keep track of usage, how I'm feeling, if I excercise, how many hours of sleep I'm getting, and notes about my experience. It's super helpful. I also make personal videos to myself to watch when I'm feeling weak. 
4) I told my closest friends so they can keep me accountable. We're going to throw a celebratory party when it's over. It's planned for March 1.
5) Suppliment regiment: DLPA 500mg 2x a day, vit c, flax seed oil, vit d, and NR. I also drink a ton of herbal tea.
5) exercise! I force myself to lift weights or go on a bike ride every day. 
6) have a long term project! I'm rebuilding a bike right now which has been great to keep my mind occupied.
7) watch a comfort tv show (mine is Lost)  

2 Questions for you all:
1) If I cold turkey when I'm down to 4gs a day, how will the WDs be? 
2) anyone else crying for no reason? It's not a sad cry, but more of a pink cloud feeling with tears. It's very interesting and l have had like 3 brief experiences like this every day.",2,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.6698778}"

They only really know what I've told them about kratom, which was that ""it's just an herb that helps with my pain."" I was really nervous about hanging out with them for a couple of reasons. 1. I was worried the W/D symptoms would be too intense to be able to really enjoy the time and I'd just be out of it or weird. and 2. for the past 9 months, whenever id hang out with them id take kratom before and multiple times during a hang, and i was worried i wouldn't be ""fun"" without the Kratom. 

But to my surprise, both of these things were  COMPLETLY wrong. First, Hanging out with them basically made me forget about the w/d for a few hours. I definitely felt a little off closer to when I was gunna go home but nothing that was more than just a tired long day feels.  Second, I found I was able to be more present and was more fun than ever- maybe because I wasn't constantly in a fog state and could actually really engage with them.  

Today has been pretty good also- I woke up around 9:30 so i actually got 8 hours of sleep- I owe my sleepful nights to my gabapentin. i take 300 mg before bed and that's it. I was able to push my second dose an extra 30 minutes which was my goal. I went to my parents for a NY Day Lunch and then ended up speaking with my EX. Im pretty sure the effects of Kratom caused a lot of our issues. I told him about quitting and he was really glad for me- i told him about this subreddit and just how helpful it is. we ended up talking for a while so it again distracted me for a while from the next dose.  the biggest things for me rn are a small headache and some feelings of boredom and restlessness (probably why this post is so long lol). 

So key takeaways- it really really helps to pull yourself out of ur normal ""space"" and normal routine and do things that keep u mentally occupied. other people are really helpful for that. also, i woke up feeling this AM really proud of myself for deciding to do this and be moving into 2021 working towards a healthy self.

Even though I acknowledge how it made me feel, I don’t have an urge to use it. It could be right in front of me and I just wouldn’t bother. 3 months ago I was struggling (my last post shows that) and I had never felt more overwhelmed and saw no way out. Every time I see Kratom mentioned or think about it, I remember what I went through, it felt like it would never end.

It’s such a hard thing to go through, even though you know you’ll benefit from withdrawal that doesn’t stop the pain. But the pain actually benefits you more than you think. If withdrawal was easy, I would still be on Kratom. I’d still lose so much money, be so reliant on it etc. but because the withdrawal was difficult, being off of Kratom feels better than when I was on it.

I know it’s hard to comprehend, especially if you have preexisting mental problems like myself. But that painful process of getting here was necessary. I don’t wake up thinking about it, I haven’t thought about it in months, it was only when someone mentioned “the devils lettuce” I remembered Kratom (even though they’re referring to weed).

The best advice I can offer is: do not fall victim to the tricks your mind will use. It will bargain with you by making it seem so permanent and distressing with no light at the end of the tunnel. But you are just temporarily sick. That’s it. It’s like being a child, you get sick all the time because your immune system isn’t strong but you needed the experience to get a stronger immune system, and now you never think about it again.

Not my first rodeo so I'm familiar with how I respond during wds and for me the worst part is the RLS (which is more like restless body - my whole body feels the urge to move) coupled with the almost total lack of ability of sleep. Everything else - the depression, anxiety, cravings, anhedonia, pain, cold body etc. I can handle but the sleep issues turn me into a nutcase.

I have some leftover gabapentin from my last quit- which isn't doing squat for me this time around so I'm eyeing something else in my posession - Zopiclone.

I was given a script for it about 4 months ago for severe insomnia but never ended up using it - for some reason I have an irrational fear when it comes to sleep meds, (I hate being put out for procedures) it's an anxiety thing.

I was wondering if anyone here has experience with Zopiclone during the first stage of wd until the sleep/rls comes under control. I'm worried if I take it I still won't sleep - and be agitated with rls on top of it to boot, which doesn't sound fun and indeed leave me worse off.

It has been exactly 12 days since the last time I took a liquid shot of K! Since then I have been on subs, started with 4mg a day, tapering, lowering my dosage every couple of days , and today is my first day lowering my dose to only 1mg a day. 5mg in the AM, .5mg later around 6 pm. I’m gonna stay at this dose for 5 days, then go down to only .5mg ONCE a day, then only .25, then I will jump. Only taking ibuprofen for the muscle aches currently.

So I will be coming off a super low dose of the subs when I finally jump. Tapering has me already feeling SLIGHT WD symptoms. (Runny nose, achy, a little tired, no appetite) but definitely bearable as I’m here at work, and in a positive mood. I’m assuming since I’m already feeling the WDs now, that it’s a good thing. Meaning my body is adjusting to such small doses, so I truly believe when I jump it won’t be TOO bad, I hope lol. I’ve actually done this taper two years ago, and had pretty shitty WDs but only for 3 or 4 days, with no medication besides Ibuprofen and lidocaine patches for the achy muscles. Then I was pretty much back to normal after a week. And when I say normal I mean my symptoms were gone. I felt completely fine. (Side note - I’m always amazed when people say they have wd symptoms after a month. Maybe jumping off too high of a dose? A month is seriously a super long time I feel to be experiencing wd symptoms!?)

Anyways, this time a reddit guardian angel sent me a care package. This man is truly a lifesaver. Didn’t do it for money, simply to help me. Faith in humanity has been restored lol.

So I’ve got the following - 


I’ve got 14 clonidine 0.1 mg.

I’ve got 6 gaba 300 mg.

I’ve got 2 Seroquel 25 mg.

I’ve never taken any of the three, so I’m taking suggestions on how to dose, when to start taking after last sub dose, and what to expect/side effects?

Has anyone taken all three of these at the same time? How did it help with WDs?

Always made strained tea w/ a tablespoon (or two) of powder, so not sure what my precise gpd usage was.  Started to aggressively taper at 9gpd 3 days ago.  Moved down to 6gpd yesterday.  Plan on staying at 6gpd today and moving to 5gpd tomorrow.  My guiding principal is to not have more than I had the day before and listen to my body to lower my gpd usage.

Yesterday, new years eve, was tough to stick to my regime.  I saved the last 4gpd for about 11pm and was able to get a fine night of sleep, about 7hrs, without any other medication.  I felt like crap during the day between doses a bit, but it was very management.  I also let my parents know sort of what I was going through.  I see them often and wanted them to know that if I wasn't myself, that's why.

So today I woke up around 9am after staying up until 2am.  I felt totally fine and ran 1mile and did a 30min kettlebell workout, then took an ice cold shower.  It's now almost 1 and I'm going to have 1.5g.  I could probably push this out another few hours but I'm going to head to the beach and don't want to have diarrhea while I'm there - which seems to be the first real symptom of WD symptoms that I go through.  

Overall, though, this taper is progressing quite well.  Minimal symptoms.  I get pretty antsy at about the 14-16hr mark of no kratom, and have my first dose.  My general approach is to push that timeline out as long as possible, and consistently lower my dosage.  Last time I did this I was having 0.5g around noon and then 0.5g before sleep and was able to jump off at that point successfully.  I did have pretty bad flank pain and diarrhea, but I totally accept that as part of the healing process.

This time, I will not go back to this lifestyle.  I hate kratom.  ""ItS JuSt LiKe CoFfEe ThOuGh...""  No, it's not.  I have quit drinking coffee dozens of times and only had a slight headache for a day or two which is easily curable with ibuprofen (without caffeine obviously).  This is a different beast.

I did get great suggestions for supplements to help with RLS which was destroying my soul and have those coming Wednesday. I’ve decided to try tapering instead. My Dad went that route and didn’t have too much trouble he says. 

My question though is if I was doing 60-80 GPD and then 6 days with nothing what would be a good initial tapering dose? Just trying to stave off the worst of withdrawal but not take more steps back than needed.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49216878}"

Coming off of a 90-100 gpd habit towards the end was nerve-wracking. My physical symptoms lasted a couple of days but it’s gone now and I can see the light. Last night for New Year’s Eve, drinking wine and laughing with my family about nostalgic memories really made me miss these old days. I also called all my best friends and apologized to the pain I caused them and I could feel the relief in their voices. They all knew something was wrong but I had just blocked them out. They had assumed the worst but just being honest with them really changed my perspective on my relationships. 2021 will be full of days spent with them. Why would I want to spend time locked away in a struggle against myself? Life is so fragile but together we can overcome anything. The world is literally our canvas to create. I want to be somebody - not a cog in a vicious machine which depletes this creativity. In retrospect, the saddest part about my addiction is that Kratom didn’t even make me feel good - I would go so far as to say that it caused dysphoria. What makes me feel good is being free and feeling love towards my friends and family. It was obvious something was off with me but I feel 80% better then I did after my last dose. I’m blessed to have travelled around the world and would like to do so more when possible. This is probably just one of the good days I’m going through but lord knows it’s not the last and I consider this a milestone in my quitting journey. I’m prepared for the remaining mental battle. Have a great 2021 everyone and don’t let this pathetic powder slave-drive you. Cheers to all of us having a better life. #day12",10,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.41461337}"
2021-01-01 06:39:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/ko9ydt/dopamine_detox_ct/,Dopamine detox + CT,"I’ve seen a few videos of peoples doing a dopamine detox, meaning as little instant gratification as possible. Basically you can exercise, eat healthy, and walk around. They do this in order to get back their motivation and drive instead of scrolling through their phone for gratification. 

Now combine this with CT? Seems tough! but it theory I think it would make WDs worse but not necessarily last as long.

It’s kind of ironic though, because CT is a dopamine detox in itself. I am just wondering if anyone has done this before? Today is day one for me and I am pretty certain I am going to attempt the detox as well. Everything except for music because it’s the only thing that can get me through the night without going insane.

For this new year I've decided to make some changes in my life.  

One of them is kicking kratom.  

I started using it when I broke my leg to help with the pain and sleeping at night.  

I stopped using for a couple of months, after it made me sick once, but then adjusted my dosage and starting using daily. 

It was really great for anxiety and also made working long hours less taxing.  

My dosage got pretty high for a while, more than 20g/day at one point.  I knew this was bad for me (I could feel it) so I started to potentiate 3-5g doses with a mixture of caffeine and 5-htp (100 - 200 mg of each). This allowed for a lower dose while retaining some of the mood altering effects.  It also helped me avoid constipation.     

Eventually, I settled into a 12 - 15g a day habit like this.  

Part of this habit also included a host of other bad habits that were exacerbated by the lockdown and an unhealthy work/life balance.  Now I'm several months into a chemical dependency that has made both my body and mind weaker.  

48 hours ago, I quit CT.  I tried to taper first, but discomfort in my left flank told me that was a bad idea and I dropped the idea pretty quick.  

The first two days were horrible.  Hot and cold flashes, sweats, headaches, diarrhea, bloating, flank pain, weakness, fatigue, depression, and basically every other symptom you find on here.  

Things that have helped me get through this are exercise, either running or walking and some strength training, coffee or green tea, 200 mg of 5-htp and 300 - 600 mg of aspirin.  
 
I also had a glass of wine on day 1 when the constipation and cramps were at there worst, which immediately flushed me out (I never drink), though it worsened my headache :(.  

Of course all of this making sure I stay well hydrated, drinking lots of water and taking electrolytes in the morning.  

On day 3, I'm feeling functional, though somewhat in a haze. Lots of digestive issues too and decreased appetite.  

I'm really hoping I'll get back to normal after the 4 or 5 day mark.

Anyway, reading the posts and advice here have been immensely helpful to me.  So thank you everyone for being here to listen and to share your experiences!  

It really gives me hope in a dark time and shows me that there is a light at the end of this tunnel!",6,{'lockdown': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.38827935}"

I honestly never thought I would be able to get off it, but here I am. I remember last new year’s eve having the thought “You can’t do this another year man. You can’t celebrate another birthday with this poison running your life.” It took me a few months of trial and error and a very long taper but here I am. I have had very little temptation after getting off it and when it has popped into my head briefly, it was very easily shut down by remembering the pain this addiction caused me. Let this new year inspire you to move on with your life. Keep this resolution for once. It is hard, but you are your own worst enemy when it comes to addiction, and you absolutely can overcome it . Use this sub as a resource, it got me through the hardest parts and I’m not sure I could have done it without this community.

I was a heavy user for over 2 years and took my last dose on November 15th and haven’t looked back. I highly recommend you throw it away for any temptations. I tapered slowly for 4 weeks down to 1 gram before deciding this it it.

It was super tough to find motivation to do anything the first couple weeks. And to this day i still feel mildly depressed but i wake up loving that i dont have to depend on kratom to get through my day. I would wake up everyday and take 2 grams just to wake up. Looking back i cant imagine how much stress my GI tract/ liver etc has gone through.

One thing thats helped me along the way is cbd. I know i might just be trading one addiction for another but CBD overall just helped with the PAWS symptoms. Charlotte’s web CBD to be exact. 

What made me quit were the horrible mood swings, agitation, dependency and making my skin horrible not even the dermatologist was helping. While i still suffer from acne breakouts, they go away much more quickly. Also as a male i believe that 2 year run on kratom messed with my hormones so they’re slowly balancing out.

To whoever reading this, MAKE THIS YOUR BEST YEAR AND PUT ASIDE THAT KRATOM. Here to help anyone with questions about my journey. L

This subreddit has meant the world to me in terms of getting myself to quit. Just wanted to pay it forward to those contemplating quitting and those who are currently in their journey. Happiest new year to everyone!",29,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.55667937}"
