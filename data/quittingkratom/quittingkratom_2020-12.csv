Late to my daily update today, which is a good thing because I had a pretty good day. I am definitely past the worst and am slowly progressing each day. 

This morning was strange I woke up and felt like It was day 2 of withdrawal. I felt shitty, RLS, didn't want to get up, sweating and so on.   I got up started my morning and with in 10 minutes it was gone. Im not sure if this was paws or just me being dramatic, but it was confusing in the moment. 

Anyway since this morning the day went really well.  I was pretty busy the entire day and really have noticed how important it is to stay busy.  I am basically fine until I stop moving and relax.  As soon as I stop pushing the mental games start and the small pains start.  

RLS is really the only acute left that is annoying.  For whatever reason RLS was worse last night than the prior night, and I was still able to sleep.  Sleep is only like a 6/10, but ill take it.  I ultimately still sleep most of the night, but I cant wait for the first solid 8 hour night. 

Looking forward to starting the new year.

We can do it!",9

I decided to do a taper from a 25-30g/day habit about a month ago. I closely track how much I take and when I take it. I *think* I've made progress by getting my consumption of regular leaf down by about 40%. However, it just occurred to me that my use of Stem & Vein *may* be skewing my perception...

Although my regular leaf consumption has gone down, if I add up the regular leaf + stem & vein I consume, my total powder consumption has really not gone down. In fact, there are some times when I take a little more S&V than usual, so my total powder consumption may be even slightly higher. I really wasn't using S&V before I started to taper. Yet, when I tally up my intake at the end of the day, I focus on the amount of regular leaf and pay less attention to S&V.

I know there are differing opinions on S&V. I also know there are recommended ways of using S&V to taper, ex: replacing a % of the normal dose with S&V, and increasing the ratio over time. I should probably do a better job of that system. My questions:

* Do you feel I'm making real progress, and is the 40% reduction of regular leaf representative of real progress? Or, is my increased use of S&V inhibiting any real progress and just tricking me into thinking I'm on a good path?
* Should I be taking S&V into account when considering and tracking my overall intake and taper?
* Considering I am dead set on tapering and not going cold turkey, do you have suggestions on how I should tweak what I'm currently doing?

Thank you so much in advance for your input!",2

2020-12-30 15:00:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/kn9iz2/day_1_i_hope/,"Day 1, I hope","So I have been using kratom for about 3 years with short periods of stopping at most like a week at a time. For about an 8 month period in there I convinced myself that if I only used it 3 or 4 times a week, it would be okay. For the most part it wasn't terrible, but the off days, I basically would feel like I was in a very mild withdrawal but not terrible because I wasn't using everyday. But then I'd dose because it was not an off day and then the cycle would roll on.

In March when the pandemic hit my usage went way up. Instead of doing things on the weekends, Friday, Saturday and Sunday since March I'd use about 25 grams per day, and then Monday through Thursday I'd do about 5 grams per day, no off days anymore, and usually at night because I didn't want to use it at work. 5 grams is enough to get a night's worth of sleep so I could work the next day. 

The problem is, everyday is a struggle. It's almost like I'm constantly in a loop of withdrawal since for three days a week on the weekend, my usage went way up, and then throughout the week at a lower dosage I'd be in withdrawal. Then Friday would hit and I'd go right back up.

Monday night I took 5 grams, last night I took 3.75 grams, and today I think I want to take nothing and just stop this madness. I feel like I'm withdrawing anyway, so what's the point of even taking some anyway. Monday night I was having restless legs and night sweats and same with last night. Body aches etc. and I'm still technically dosing.

I imagine if I don't take anything tonight, it won't be too different in terms of withdrawal symptoms. I want to be done with this shit, but everytime the negative effects of withdrawal come on, I convince myself to just take a little because it will at least give me some relief. I know the real key would be to stop binging on the weekends, but I think I need to throw it all away because I can't trust myself.",6

I've had multiple chances to quit and never made it past 50 hours.","I come from a family of opiate addicts with long histories of addiction. So I feel my attempts at quitting are harder than they should be.

I've been using Kratom for 2.5 years bouncing somewhere between 15-30 grams/day everyday. As a poly substance addict I used it to get off meth, suboxone, fentanyl....etc to get a ""safer"" habit. I've had multiple chances to stop but the cravings and withdrawal anger/irritability are just too much to handle. Mentally I feel like I'm losing my fucking mind the moment the WD hits because I also have other mental health problems like depression/anxiety and self esteem issues which only fuels this addiction. Coupled with the WD...its just too much to bear. I can't distract myself and cave to the next dose.

My wife will hide the bags and I'm tearing up the house for hours looking for that useless next fix that never gets me high anymore, if it does it lasts 20 mins and then makes me extremely moody/depressed. It reminds me of when I was addicted to Oxys/fentanyl 6 years ago (cold turkey quit). Same old cravings and rummaging through the household! Once I have this bullshit powder back in my body I go back to normal and then back to craving within 10 hours like clockwork.

When will this stop? Not even the threat of divorce makes me want to stop mentally. One day I will run out of chances and I feel defeated.

2020-12-30 13:56:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/kn88z1/quitting_this_green_garbage/,Quitting this green garbage,"I've in my late 30s and have been using kratom for a few years.  I'm not actually sure exactly when I started.  Maybe in 2017 I think.  There's a place down the street from me that brews kratom drinks into incredible beer-like draft kratom drinks and I've been having those socially, at the bar, for years, and having it at the house.  Well, like everything else, it's become a problem.  I'm so damn lazy these days.  I sleep like shit.  I can't do anything without having some kratom tea.  I quit for about a month last summer after doing a pretty aggressive taper down to 1g/day over three weeks.  I'm actually not sure what my consumption was then, or now, because I either have pre-brewed teas from the establishment down the road or I brew tea myself.  I almost never have the powder raw anymore - though I used to.  Normally I pour about a heaping tablespoon in a jar, squeeze in a lime, and steep it in boiled water for about 10 minutes and strain out the powder.   I'm a little curious if anyone has any experience with the difference between consuming the powder or straining it.

The last time I quit I jumped from 1g/day for about a month.  I was exercising very hard, regularly, and didn't feel much effect - if any - from the quit.  Then I had a medical issue and thought for sure I was going to die of cancer, so of course I started again, and my issue resolved itself with some routine over-the-counter medicine.  

I have no idea what the equivalent amount of powder would be in the tea that I strain.  I stopped having the raw powder because I hated the way it made me feel at larger doses.  So I'm not quite sure where to start my taper this time.  I'm not going to quit cold turkey.  I have a kid and job and I have to be somewhat functional, so I'm going to taper.  I think I'm going to try to taper the same way I did last time.  I had 3g, strained, as tea, 3 times a day.  I dropped 0.5g per dose every two days until I was at 1g/day.   I remember pretty clearly that I had a little trouble sleeping, but I always kept my last dose for 30mins before sleep and it always let me get a little bit of heavy sleep.

I'm really pissed I let this get away from me.  I quit drinking years ago and felt great - it had also become a problem.  But this really seemed so innocent, but then you realize it's numbed you out of existence and it's contributing to every problem you have in life.  It's not fun anymore - it's just a chemical addiction that I'm servicing and a slave to.  Fuck that.

Well, I wanted to create this throwaway account so I could track my progress with you fellas.  I found great relief in AA when I quit drinking and know the value of holding yourself accountable to a community, commiserating with friends, and having some people to talk to throughout the process.  

I'm so sick of being a fucking slave to this garbage, bullshit, green cunt-sludge.  I only like it because I need it - and I know that.  I was making the same excuses for this crap that I made for alcohol.  Any excuse works; every excuse works; and every opportunity for a new excuse is a great excuse to rationalize stuffing this chemical bullshit into my guts.",17

Its now 6 months later, and I have been meaning to quit for awhile, and when I friend gave me a few muscle relaxers it seemed like a good time to do it.

I want to start off saying this is heaven compared to normal opiate withdrawal, and yet its still painful just mostly mental and way less physical.
The depression I am having makes trying to get anything accomplished almost impossible.

After finding this forum I went to see what I could find from your list at the store.
I feel no effects from the Ashwangha. This is disappointing because so many write ups on the internet make it sound amazing.

Oh well, hopefully the Melatonin helps me sleep better.

For new member, don't give up, u will find the light at the end of the tunnel. Here my previous post about my journey:

Hi everyone, just want to reupload my previous post with some update.
Still cant believe that I can do it after used kratom for 11years. It feels amazing to be free from kratom.

Want to share my early post about my wd symptoms. I just quit without any preparation of supplement. Luckily I found this subreddit around day 7 CT.

- Day 1 to 3, not very sick.. but trouble at sleep..
- Day 4 to 7 , the worst part in my life.. like im living in hell (rls, sneezing, not sleep at all for 7days, hot flash body, muscle cramps, anxiety, zero energy, diarrhea)
- Day 7 to 14, the worst is start to decrease day by day but the PAWS is coming i think  but thankfully i manage to hold and this subreddit play major role to motivated me.. start getting some sleep after I take BSO. And I don't remember what day I take magnesium and calcium.
- Day 14 to 21, the sickness will fade away & by day 21, i think i dont have body pain anymore, just psychological pain.

Update :

- Day 34, finally feel 90% normal. 
- Day 81, PAWS start hitting back because of covid 19 lockdown. Luckily I can hold it.
- Day 142, my daughter was born (best day of my life because she is the main reason I quit kratom)
- Day 200+/- , Get my normal life back. Free from kratom. Never ever thought about kratom anymore. The only thing i concern about is my weight gained 10kg now, i need to start healthy diet & more exercise.

Thanks everyone. Stay strong & keep fighting.",72

Disclaimer: I put lil peep at the bottom since he's got so much but I would try him out first he was the artist that helped the most. And if you don't like rap don't be decieved by his name his music is more alternative rock mixed with a lil hip-hop.  Enjoy, hope they help.

I got caught up in this again after a really bad hangover one morning and it just grew from there over the last 11 months.  I think with the Covid Quarantine, I gave myself a free pass as there wasn't much else to do.  But it's time, I reached the same point where  it was affecting my health, I had acne all over my face (which is now gone) and I am about 15 pounds under my normal weight.  I had two weeks off of work and I knew I had to do it.  

I was worried that this time was going to be harder than the last time, but there is some light at the end of the tunnel.  All of our bodies are different and react differently.  Day one was the worst for me (I almost gave in and pivoted to a taper, even got in my car to go to the head shop but turned around), then Day two was just no energy, and Day 3 three is a little better.  Some hot flashes at night and some RLS, but I have thankfully been able to sleep every night.  Be sure to use the Magesium for RLS, BSO for general comfort and Melatonin is a sleep helper for me.   
I read all of your posts every day and they are very encouraging.  If you are reading this and planning a jump, do it.  From my experience, if you can make it through the first 100 hours, it's all downhill from there.  Good luck to everyone out there and I am rooting for you!",3

I’ve used 30gpd for a year since quitting heroin/fentanyl I’m extremely surprised with the withdrawal feeling, I’m very perplexed because I’m not sure if people just don’t know what it does to people or if they just want to sell it so they portray it as little to no withdrawals. In my case that is certainly untrue. Since 2pm yesterday when I came off the dose I had extreme anxiety that I was going to have a psychotic break and I couldn’t get away from that idea. I haven’t had that feeling yet today and I’m not sure if I will but the physical aspect of these withdrawals are awful. My lower back is in severe pain, and it’s hard for me to find enjoyment in anything I usually like to do. I’ve called off work for the next two weeks to try and get back to normal. This forum has really helped a lot. I read something in here that said to “embrace what’s happening” and I’ll say that had been the best way for me to cope. To say to yourself enjoy this because you put yourself here has lightened my mood and I’ve felt myself smiling and laughing at myself over this. I’m sure I have it easier then some so if anyone needs someone to discuss with or just to listen to what they are going through and dealing with please message me. Together we are stronger and have a better chance of success then to go through this alone. Thank you for being here idk what I would do if I couldn’t read people success and struggles to know I’m not alone.",16

Used it to get off opioids and it has worked. Haven't taken one in nearly a year. But I did start out taking Kratom capsules in big quantities. It started out as 20 pills each at least 4 times a day. Which is about 10grams. So it was about 40grams per day sometimes more. I've cut down over the months only taking between 12 and 16 capsules each at least 4 times a day. For the past few weeks it seems like every time I take them..even if I dose down to just 10 capsules at a time that I get these bad stomach aches. Like it hurts so bad for at least 30 minutes to an hour. Not sure what it's doing to my stomach but it has made me want to quit. I want to dose down a lot more than I have been. Maybe even take 5 capsules at a time just so I don't have to withdraw so bad. Not sure if this will help my stomach at all but its worth a shot. Been thinking that Kratom isn't is good as its talked about because the withdrawals remind me of opioid withdrawal if not as bad.,6

Yesterday was a good day with little fatigue. Today I feel like I got hit by a truck. I’ve been off gabapentin for 4 days and clonidine for 3 days. Using a few hits of Delta 8 THC at bedtime but honestly I kinda hate it (always hated smoking and the sensation) so will prob knock that off after the 2 week mark. I’m just so proud and it was so much less awful than I expected and was scared of. My longest quit since I started in June 2019 has been 11 days so I’m very close to that! I’ve noticed I am interested again in learning and watching documentaries which I never had the drive to do while on Kratom. Music Isnt hitting like everyone says it will but I was never huge into music anyway. Hang in there all,11

Along with kratom i'm taking 300-500mg of phenibut everyday.about the same time as kratom.
Basicly it started when i looked for something to change alcohol with. Not to mention other drugs :amphetamines,mdma,weed,coke. All the drugs are in my life basicly from when i first discovered that i can change my conciousness from about 15yeArs old. Depression,anxiety,lack of focus,motivation and self esteem was and is big part of my life.
I dont know why but from all the drugs kratom is my devil. It is so hard to quit. I keep falling back in the same place when i try to taper. Even phenibut (in this dosage range) is relatively easy to stop. But kratom... i decided to try to go to detox and then try to go to 12step program. I want to try it. I know its possible ti live without any substances,but at this moment i absolutely cannot see myself living sober. I just dont want to change kratom or phenibut with those psychiatric medication,because this exchange is even worse.
I could use kratom all mu life but lately i noticed that it absolutely killed my creativity,sense of humour,enjoyment in simple things and ability to make (and finish) making music(i'm a musician)...i cannot read books anymore,dont want to workout and list goes on and on. All kratom gives me is just 1hour of feeling ""better"" and then sudden mood change to worse. .. so on january 5th i'm going to detox. I cannot do it by myself, not anymore... hopefully this will bring some clarity to my life,and i can go back on a spiritual path just like i was before and more..  sorry,my thoughts are all over the place,but if you're reading,thank you. Any tips for how to survive detox,or maybe how to sleep better there( nights of withdrawal are insane rls for me) please feel free to write me. Thank you guys for being here, basicly all of the time i was not writing here,just looking. So i thought maybe its time to make a post.",13

This is the first vacation  off of work I’ve taken this past year not to use as a “ detox” week!  Trust me, it was never a vacation!  It’s amazing how much time, energy and money I wasted. I relapsed so many  times and this last time I thought if I don’t get through this I’m f’d.  
I know I am never out of the woods with Kratom.  Reading everyone’s posts on here has helped tremendously!  I was not able to share this with anyone and I know this “ secret” is what kept me sicker than sick.  
I am an addict and have been since I was probably 15.  I just switched addictions ( mainly narcotics) and am now able to have some compassion for myself.  
Check out Gabor Mate on YouTube .  His videos about addiction are excellent!  Listening to him helped me a lot.
I used to be a distance runner and am back doing it again.  Exercise saved me in the past and is saving me now.  I also do strenuous yoga and meditate.  I remember on day 2 CT trying to walk and I felt like I was going to die.  It gets better quickly but the first 2 weeks were hard.

Massive improvments the last 3 days. Actually woke up this morning and took a solid poo and had pep in my step for work (construction). Later hit with a wave of fatigue and irritability. But it comes in waves. Few hours I feel great next few I'm okay or below. Anyway I'll move on to the moment I realized I had to quit. 

So last Thursday was a big day for our company as we're were pouring a big slab the next day and we had a shit ton of stuff to do still. So in preparation I bought some capsules (usually go with toss and wash but I didn't have time to go to where I normally get my stuff). It's a company I'm sure all of you know (hint: the make extract shots and ryhme with neta venz) I'd never known they made capsules so I thought I'd try it out. I took the normal amount I would take capsules and man that shit either can't be k or just k maybe extract? IDK but it was a bizarre high. Lights were magnified, and just high I've never experienced on K. And I've took my fair share of too much k and it was not the same. They even tasted and smelt different. So obviously I was blizted and did not feel like i could keep up at work. So I went to the trailer and just sat and stared at a wall until the supervisor stepped in and asked what's up. I told him I wasn't feeling well and he said yeah you look like shit (lol) so he sent me home. I felt very gulty because as I said before it was big day for the company and I felt I let the guys down. Then I started crunching the numbers of how much I actually was spending on it and I was spending multiple THOUSANDS a year and that's really the moment for me. I knew Christmas was coming up and our mandatory saftey meeting (8 hrs of saftey shit they have to tell us to cover their ass), and I knew we were getting our bonus. So I figured I'd use this ""pandemic"" in my favor so they said I had to stay home for a week. Missed the shitty meeting and still got paid 😎

Fast forward to this Monday and a guy I work with that we often would conversate about k with. First thing he said when I got their was ""was it k"" and I told him yes actually but it's because I quit. Apparently he had no idea that k causes dependency and I told him my horror story, I could tell in his eyes this was news to him. I then asked him how much does he actually take. His reply was if he has the money 6-8 mita Ken shots 🤯. I was blown away. First off that's a fuck ton of money to be spending on k a day. He basically works for his kratom habit it seems. I then tell him to go look up k withdrawals on break. He then comes back and tell me yeah I guess it is a thing. But that for people who take a lot. I then try to explain to him what are in the shots and how consintrated they. He didn't quite seem to grasp it. He's still in denial and continues to say, yeah well I've done hard drugs before and that's not happened to me. I ask him how long have you been doing this. He's says it's been a while, 3 or 4! Of concentrates! I then tell him what I would do which would be to test himself and see if he's dependant. Try to go 5 days without it. He agrees and said he had taken one that morning and is gonna not take any for 5 days. He confident it's gonna be a breeze. Well we're working today and I wait later on in the day as I don't want to come off as preachy. I ask him how he's feeling. He replys oh I'm fine, honestly I hadn't even thought about it til you mentioned it. It had been around 30 hours at that point. He can't be telling the truth so I don't think I'm even gonna bother anymore. Just thought his amount he was taking and his denial was bizzare lol. Should I bother motivating and pusbing to him or nah? He's not really a friend just a work colleague. Everyone calls him how dirt cause he looks just like him (drives a fire bird, perfect) and he actually embraces it tells people to call him it. For the first time today I heard him quote the movie 😂. Alright I got to stop just had thumb diahrea.

But in the past year and a half I started abusing tramadol painkillers in high amounts and got to the point I had to do it daily. About 6 months ago I got off them and started taking Kratom for the withdrawals thinking I could easily just stop taking that too and wouldn’t get addicted. My girlfriend of three years broke up with me and I found out she cheated which made my kratom usage go up to easily 40-50 gpd always taking it multiple times a day and having to bring it wherever I go in case it started to wear off and I needed to go make a disgusting green powder liquid in the bathroom in my water bottle. I have ran out and didn’t have money for more a couple times during this and it was such a desperate horrible feeling, leading me to do things I would never do to get money and getting me in a lot of trouble with my parents who I have been living with since I lost my job due to covid. I won’t lie everything in my body wants me to keep taking it and my brain convinces me it’s okay, but I know I can’t keep living like this. I hardly do anything anymore besides lay around and wait for my next dose to get a few hours of comfort again. My parents know about my addiction now but don’t really understand anything about it or even really “believe” that it has actual withdrawals and keep telling me to stop being a pussy basically and just stop taking it and deal with it. The withdrawals truly make me have suicidal thoughts and the worst anxiety on top of the bad physical feelings as I’m already depressed and just have been using it to cope. I really want to commit to tapering off but I have such bad self control with it that unless I actually make a plan to stick to I always do the same thing then run out too quickly and have to desperately do anything to be able to just get another big bag. It’s wasted all my money and ruining my relationship with my family and friends and I’ve felt enough pain from this shitty little green powder that I think I’m ready to be done. Having to deal with withdrawal in my parents house with my brother here too all extremely unsympathetic and actually making fun of my addiction or yelling at me every day about my life is making this even harder for me. Does anyone have any advice for what I can do to not be completely in hell and not cave in to taking my normal dosage for a first time quitter? 

Sorry for the long winded post.  I have no one in my life who even tries to understand and I am too ashamed of telling my friends about this weird “natural drug” I’m addicted to, so this is my first time telling this to any other human being.",4

Day 13 here so two weeks tomorrow which is exciting.  I have to say the biggest difference in the last 3 days is actually enjoying my day.  Day 1-10 honestly I was just waiting for every hour to pass.  Looking forward to bedtime just so I could get up the next day and check another day.  That has definitely changed now the last 3 days.  

Overall I am feeling much better though definitely not 100%. Definitely some mental games going on, but not nearly as bad as expected.  RLS is still dragging on.. not to the point where it stops me from sleeping, but still pretty annoying. Still sneezing all the time (though the sneezing doesn't bother me at all, just not the best attribute while during covid times).  

All discomfort in general is magnified.  I feel that since my senses were numbed the last 9 months small pains are more noticeable.  I guess this isn't a bad thing and I guess I am just feeling again which overall is what I want. 

Overall good day though.  Looking forward to tomorrow! 

We can do it!",15

Day 28-29 seemed to be my 'switch flipping' day where what remained of the lingering mental anguish disappeared. No more sweating during the day (strangely this was only while awake, never at night in bed) and anxiety levels are lower than they've been in years.

Been taking L-Theanine, 5-HTP,  elemental magnesium, and ∆8 THC at night for sleep which is helping immensely. Now that I think I'm finally done with the worst of it the next step will be cutting out the ∆8, but I'm less concerned about this.

That said, I have also been fighting off a UTI and visited the doctor yesterday for antibiotics. I’m curious whether these symptoms, which feel like acute withdrawals but not as intense, are due to my body fighting off infection or   could it be kratom withdrawal still almost two months after my last dose. Has anyone experienced random withdrawal symptoms far after your quit? Also, I have had drinks almost everyday since Christmas.

Kratom is definitely a net negative for me but it was covering up some chronic sinus problems and keeping me away from alcohol. I just will have to cope without it and find another path.

We’re not alone and my fam member told me they were addicted to meth something I wouldn’t have guessed. I’ve held it all in but talking about it really helps.

The constant constipation and irregular bowel movements. Not being able to nap whenever I want. Having to take sleeping aid or melatonin to sleep and waking up feeling like I haven’t slept. Placing a green sludge first always instead of my health. Not knowing if the pain I feel or the swallow lymph node was because of Kratom (which I believe it was). 

All for what? To feel a sense of release or high that wasn’t even worth it? Everyone has their reasons to why they stated and that’s what’s continuing them down the path.

Day 12 here! Feeling a lot better.  For reference you can look at my past submitted posts, but from where I was a week ago I am feeling much better.  

I would say the first 5-6 days were not great as the acutes were definitely in action. Then days 7-10 I had moments where I felt normal.  Now days 11-12  I mostly feel normal and then have moments where I remember i'm still healing. Today out of the 12 hours ive been awake probably 10 were so good I forget for a moment im still coming down off Kratom.  The two hours I dont feel great are really just minor discomfort that probably wouldn't bother a normal person.  

I originally quit 12 days ago because I was visiting family end of december .  Well today is the day and im with family now and couldn't be happier with my decision.  I couldn't imagine sneaking out and buying Kratom or hiding it from them or even worse going through withdrawal while with them. 

Overall today was a great day.  Ran 5 miles this afternoon at a pretty decent pace.  Looking forward to a nice dinner with my fam.  

Just to be clear I am not 100%, but considering I just used for 9 months (kratom and some much heavier opiates). To be feeling pretty good after only 12 days is amazing. 

Sleep is good enough. Definitely not sleeping how I used too and I wake up with this intense energy and pounding heart, but it goes away pretty quickly. Though sleeping at least 5-6 hours a nigh which is enough, but im up at like 6 A.M. wired.

I might also add that male pattern baldness is not genetic in my family, all the men on my mother's side of the family had full heads of hair up until death, and the same goes for my father's.

I used kratom to get off of buprenorphine towards the beginning of the pandemic.  I used it for about a week and then stopped and experienced very little w/d.  

I decided to start taking it again to help cut back on my drinking which escalated during quarantine and especially towards the end of my buprenorphine taper. 

I actually felt only positive effects for the first few months, and escalated my daily use to about 20-30gpd max.  I almost completely stopped drinking altogether.  

Than the negatives - after a few months it started to noticeably effect my once healthy sex drive.  On doses below 8mg/day bupe never effected my sex drive the way kratom does.  It seamed like a small trade off at first - I generally felt better on kratom at this dose than any dose of bupe.  

Than it started to effect my appetite. It always made me a bit less hungry, but something happened and it began destroying my appetite.  All the medical cannabis I could ingest wouldn’t even help.  I started losing the weight I tried so hard to put on.  

So, I’m ready.  Kratom is just like any other opioid at the end of the day.  It may be safer and less addicting, but the negative mental and physical side effects are there.  

I’ve only taken 12gpd for the last 3 days.  I’m tired, freezing cold, and every time I doze off I have an involuntary emmison(lol).  Other than that, I’m physically comfortable for the most part. 

Should I bite the bullet and cold turkey or continue a taper?  What can I expect if I cold turkey?  Will tapering for a bit longer make it easier or just prolong it?  What would you do?",2

While secretly going through withdrawal during Christmas and the following days has been a bit hellish (if not a bit masochistic), I'm starting to feel that it's the best Christmas gift I could have given myself -even through the pain. I just thought I'd share some of my (positive) insights on the matter since I hope that they can help at least a few of you on your journeys.

Life is tough, and while kratom helps soften the blows a bit I find that it also dulls the pleasant moments that keep us going. Even though these moments are often few and far between and things often seem OK while maintaining a kratom addiction, I've found feeling just OK is no proper substitute for the natural joy our own bodies can give us when we're clean even if it's only occasional. 

Withdrawal has sucked the past few days. While feeling exhausted, nauseous and apathetic while doing things with my family is far from fun, I still have found that not having to worry about when I'll be able to dose next is pretty liberating.

Each minute may feel like 10 during withdrawal, though if you're able to motivate yourself (I know it's not always easy) and keep yourself busy it really does help with this and even some of the other symptoms. There have been times during these past few days where I felt this would last forever, though when you finally start to feel it easing up even just a little it's a really great feeling. 

Additionally, here's a little (relevant) poetry I wrote:

It's nice to wake up without a hangover

And though the pain is far from over,

I can't help but feel I'm getting closer.

Anyway, I wish all of you guys luck. Even making the decision to quit means you've got some fight in you and you all have got this. Sorry if I rambled a bit but I hope you guys can take something away from this post that'll help you out!",11

It’s been this way more or less since day 22. I always was so scared of the physical withdrawals but in hindsight that was the easy part. I always thought the “mental game” would be easy if I had a strong enough mindset and regretfully it was not. That said, with the help of this group and  my accountability buddy (who I linked up with here because we quit at the same time) I’ve been able to get through the worst of the depression and lethargy. I still don’t feel great, but I didn’t feel great before I started taking kratom anyway. I am now focusing on how to improve my life and find fulfilling outlets for myself with a clear, sober mind... and that feels really good. To all those struggling, and especially those who are disheartened after the acutes go away that you are still not feeling good- it gets better. Keep pushing!",15

2020-12-28 11:34:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/kltom4/kratom_made_me_insane_story/,Kratom made me INSANE (story),"So i was a daily user of very high amounts of kratom for a year, and quit in July. I went through a month of horrible depression and other withdrawal symptoms. I got a job in August which is overnight/very early morning and in November i began using kratom on and off for energy. Starting last Saturday, i began taking about 3-6gpd of green maeng da capsules. On Christmas eve night i began having insane mood swings that made me frightening to be around, but i didnt think much of it until Saturday. Yesterday (sunday) morning, i took 2.5g in the morning.

First, my bad mood swings disappeared and i began to feel rapidly better-until i violently vomited up everything in my stomach. I couldnt even hold water down. I stayed in bed the entire day Saturday and yesterday because i felt so horrible and sick. Then, yesterday night, i began having what i would call ""signs of mental insanity"". I could only sleep for 30 mins-1 hour at a time and immediately (less than 5 seconds) after waking i would begin having crying fits from all the panic i was feeling. I began panicking about how my boyfriend was only with me to hurt me, how if i went to get help i would be thrown in the psych ward, extreme fears of returning to work, and other awful fears. 

Around 10pm i started getting so terrified that i began to have a panic attack; i was crammed against the corner of my bed against the wall and just flipping out. My boyfriend tried touching me and i freaked out on him, which made him angry. I then was so overwhelmed and felt so trapped that i threw myself off the bed onto the floor (hard floor, wood). I banged up my knuckles pretty bad and just flailed on the ground for about 10 mins screaming and crying about how i need to ""get out of here"". 

I calmed down after about a half hour, but still felt lingering panic. My legs began going numb and i worried i was getting severe blood clots. My heart was going so fast i was terrified i was having a heart attack or experiencing some kind of deadly side effect of the kratom. I eventually fell asleep, but the next morning again (this morning), immediately i began freaking out again. I eventually went the ER and got a small prescription of ativan to calm the panic.

I still feel like i am going nuts, but not as severely as last night. I am just so afraid of an episode like that happening again. Even after using kratom for a year i had never ever experienced anything this terrifying. I cant help but wonder if the kratom i took was laced with stronger drugs or something else entirely, as i have never had this sort of severe reaction before, especially with such a small amount. 

I have not taken any kratom since i vomited it up yesterday morning and had my mom get rid of the rest of the capsules. This has been so frightening and i am just hoping with everything i have that these feelings will be gone soon, since my use was pretty short term this time.

Day 7 I had a break through and felt I was on the up turn of things. Managed to feel well enough to get back to work. Slight fatigue and constipated diehrea. Other than that I almost feel I'm back to normal. But one things I've noticed since day 7 the systems start to come in waves. Feel like Superman one moment then hit with RLS and fatigue. Anxiety and depression have seemed to subside pretty much completely.  I guess I'm just lucky but I actually feel more motivated and clear headed than ever. It was a very tough day 3,4,5 it seemed hopeless. Definitely the peak of it for me. but keep on keeping on and it gets better. Best advice I'd give is have a good support system, take a week off from work and try to stay busy. Do something you love to take your mind off the fear of being in pain.

 I think this withdrawal may of severed me and my dad's relationship sadly. I missed family Christmas and I was honest with him and told him the truth of why I was feeling bad. First thing next morning he called me and in under a minute of conversation screamed at the top of his lungs FUCK YOU FUCK YOU YOU FUCKING JUNKIE MISSING CHRISTMAS CAUSE YOUR A JUNKIE. he said he didn't want me to ever come around their house anymore. He hung up immediately so I immediately retaliated and text him some harsh stuff. The way I see it he punched me so I punched him back. He a man that holds grudges so I may never speak to him again. I apologozies for the things I said but he has not responded to me at all. It hurts bad cause I don't want to lose him. My mom's so mad at him because he did it in the car in front of my younger brothers who have looked up to me. Keep in mind I've never been addicted or withdrawal from anything in my life. Its just so unfair what he did. Instead of understaing and trying to encourage me through these challenging times he says that. My mom still loves me and supports me so I know we'll always be in contact. Anyway I have to go back to work. For those in pain, keep going don't let this demon beat you! It gets better!",7

I was not a daily user but averaged probably 3 times a week at 10-15 grams.  The only acute withdrawal symptoms I felt were in the first few days but I am having pretty severe insomnia since stopping, mostly due to bad RLS.  I can usually fall asleep but then I get jolted awake 10 minutes later with this restless feeling all over and then I struggle to sleep all night.  I can get into a “pseudo sleep” state but I never really feel like I’m sleeping.  Weed completely counters this effect but I’m quitting that too.  Ugh what a time.",5
2020-12-28 09:55:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/klrxw6/day_15_feeling_great/,Day 15 feeling great,"I think I’m back to normal, or at least very close to it. I’m sleeping better than I ever did on kratom. I took some acid with my partner on Christmas and I think that may have helped too. Probably would’ve been even more helpful earlier in my quit but it encouraged both of us to lay off alcohol as well. I’ve been getting great herb lately and that has been my only vice (well...coffee too). 

For anyone unfamiliar with LSD I would not advise you use this method. Microdosing maybe, as I’m sure that is also helpful. But acid is not something to take lightly and people who have Bipolar or schizophrenia or a family history of these kinds of disorders need to exercise extreme caution. 

HOWEVER, it is truly a miraculous substance. It can help rewire your brain out of an addictive cycle. It can do a lot for the mind. I’d do your research before attempting to use it (for anything really).

I think regardless of the L, I’d be feeling pretty good by now. I was feeling good before I took it. I just think it gave my mind a nice refresh and locked the door that I had already shut on kratom in my life. 

Exercise has become a more regular part of my life these past several days too since really getting over the last hump of crappiness. I just feel healthy and alive and normal. 

Music still sounds extra fantastic too. Life’s better without kratom in every possible way. Just had to get past the rough part. It’s worth it. Keep on keepin’ on ❤️",8
2020-12-28 09:29:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/klrixx/sharing_my_story_day_7_ct/,Sharing my story (day 7 CT),"One of my friends reached out to me who has been taking kratom for 2 years and wants to quit. This is what I said to him and I thought some people here might find it useful.. 


You know I had struggled with addiction in my past when you knew me I was completely sober but before that I kicked a heroin/morphine habbit.. when I moved to NY kratom is readily available.. I didnt try it until probably a year after I lived here.. my friend takes it daily and has been for years.. I did some research on it and knew I probably shouldnt try it just because im an addict.. well one day I ran out of weed and my friend had gave me a small pill bottle filled with kratom just incase I wanted to try it.. So I did.. and I loved it.. It was like a stimulant and opiate in one.. after that I would do it sporadically usually only when I would go to his place and he would offer me some for free.. that went on for a little while and eventually he was giving me bags of it for free.. there was one night when I told
myself I cant do this anymore and need to stop before it gets out of hand.. so I flushed everything I had and started over.. I went awhile without doing it again but the same thing happened.. I would go to hang out with him he would offer me a dose and I eventually said fuck it again and took more kratom.. it stayed like that again for a bit just doing it a couple times a week but eventually I started to need it.. I liked the feeling it gave me.. I could work no problem had lots of energy and didnt care about anything.. I started buying it at the local kratom shop and would usually only get around 50g at a time that would last me 3 days if I was lucky.. I got to the point where I was dosing 3tsp in the morning 2 in the afternoon and 2 at night.. so around 15-20g a day.. this went on for about a year even tho my girlfriend threatened to break up with me if I wouldnt stop because I had a low sex drive when I was on it.. I ignored her and kept going.. eventually I got my sex drive back and she stopped caring as much which was probably a bad thing.. We broke up eventually for other reasons but the kratom definitely played a factor because I was irritable all the time and would have crazy mood swings.. after we broke up I didnt feel a thing.. didnt care we broke up just kept doing kratom because it makes you feel better.. some time went by and thats brings us to last week.. last monday I took my normal dose of kratom in the morning but something weird happened.. my heart started racing out of my chest and I started to have a panic attack.. I didnt know what to do so I called 911.. they came and tried to bring me to the hospital but I refused.. I knew it had something to do with the kratom and I was scared shitless of dying so I said okay im done.. I made a commitment to myself to stop and I did.. that same night I tried to dose one more time and I made myself throw up out of fear I would spiral back into another panic attack.. that was last monday to the day..  the first few days of quitting CT are miserable I have gone through heroin and morphine withdrawls and this was about the same for me.. rls, chills, diarrhea, depression/anxiety, hot flashes, trouble sleeping/waking up drenched in sweat.. its not fun.. but neither is the alternative.. I had the will power because of what happened to me and the fear of dying to quit.. Its not easy but its worth it and there is support out there for you if you need it.. I joined a quitting kratom subreddit where other people share their stories and it has helped tremendously.. I came clean to my friends and family about what I was going through and they all understood and did everything they could to help me.. Im on day 7 now and I feel a lot better than I did at the beginning still not 100% but I dont expect to be.. it took me over a year of taking kratom to get to the point im at and Im sure it will take awhile to feel completely normal again.. The way I look at it you’re either going to commit to take kratom the rest of your life or you will reach a point when enough is enough.. Im here for you and If you need anything just let me know.. I hope sharing my experience will help you..",9

I am 20M Thankfully I never got above 20g a day at the most - typically averaging at only 5-6g dosed once, first  in the morning. I would say for the past month my sleep has been greatly affected, I wake up at 5am full of energy and craving for my typical morning dose. Strangely enough for the past two weeks my body has been rejecting (and ejecting) my morning dose (regardless of quantity or varying vendor). I’m thinking with these “ejections” it’s basically been a fast taper. Even today I added 0.25 grams to my morning brew of green juice and my body rejected it, I’m thinking this is due to me mentally being so upset with myself, I’ve tried varying vendors, leaf color and dose size so i don’t think it’s just a “bad batch” . So far mentally things have been the hardest, I’ve always struggled with depression and anxiety but the Kratom has exasperated everything. I’m so looking forward to feeling like myself again,

I stopped using gabapentin two nights ago and last night was first night without clonidine. I did use some Delta 8 THC and it helped me sleep pretty well. I was surprised how relaxed just 2 hits from the vape pen made me. That being said I had never vaped before yesterday and don’t plan on making it a habit because it made me cough like crazy lol. But I will say it did work and I slept okay without RLS. Tonight I’ll try without it or other meds to see if the RLS is gone. 

Now my issue is absolutely awful fatigue. My body feels like a lead weight. I know this will go away and I’m so glad I chose to quit when I was off work. I still have 9 days til I go back and am hoping I am feeling more energetic by then.

Ive been taking kratom for over two years now. I was on IV H for a couple years before kratom. I had a prescription for subs for about 6 months that got me off of the H. I tried to quit subs CT 2 years ago and i i couldnt do it so i found my way over to kratom and have been doing it since. My girl hates it and im sick of it too. Im not going cold turkey bc that never works for me. I have about 5 sub strips i was going to try and use over the next 1-2 weeks tops in low doses and then stop the subs at that point to get through the early WD's. I guess what im asking is if anyone has any experience using subs very short term to quit kratom do you have any advice? What was your experience like? If so how long should i wait for my first dose? Is it like opiates where i should be fine to dose in 12-16 hours? I take just over an ounce a day of kratom. Any input would be appreciated. Thanks,2

I work nights loading packages and my sleep schedule is already kind of fucked and this is only making it worse. I get hot flashes every 20 minutes followed by a cold sweat every time, my muscles ache so bad and I have to lift heavy stuff for hours every day. My legs twitch every 2 minutes, and I get those disgusting chills that run down your spine. Hardly any sleep last night, have a feeling tonight will be the same. This feels like when I cold turkeyed off antidepressants, not fun at all.

&#x200B;

I've quit oxys after daily use for 2 months and had zero WD symptoms, so why is kratom harder? I know it's because it has several alkaloids with different effects, but it just seems backwards to me. How was oxy easier than this?

&#x200B;

Anyways, I'm unable to buy more because of my work/sleep schedule as well as currently staying with parents for the holidays. Going to go for a run now, running has been the only thing that makes quitting substances easier for me. My legs do hurt right now, maybe getting the blood flowing will help. I'm mostly posting just to clear my head and maybe get some support. I'm no stranger to the ups and downs of drug abuse, maybe this will be the last time I have to do something like this.

I am scared as when I first came off kratom a year ago it was so bad I am pretty sure I developed health anxiety and some form of mental ptsd. I swear to you all I am never touching this poison again. I made the dumb excuse of taking it again when I got covid and stupidly thought kratom could hurt me if I used for a little bit. I just would like to know what I can expect when I stop tomorrow. Thank you. <3,2

I take several grams multiple times a day and I’m over the highs and lows of it. I tried quitting 4 months ago but had the worst withdrawal symptoms. Whenever I started to fall to sleep I got these insane pins and needles/numb feeling in my chest/upper back. I couldn’t sleep at all that night and ended up going back on it the next day. I felt really disheartened that next day. And sense have felt pretty shit about myself about it. I truely also believe the kratom is what ended up causing me and my ex to break up. Where’s a good place to start in tapering? How long should it take? Is there anything to help with sleep? Anything helps.,5

After the first 2 days 80% of the withdrawal symptoms from the taper completely subsided except restless legs which I suffer from even before Kratom and the mild depression which is to be expected however one thing thats confusing me is this is the first time in any of my taper or cold turkey that by day 5/6 I am still sweating at night or if I lay down in bed, not a lot only slightly but its still uncomfortable especially since im literally COLD any help would be appreciated thanks guys.",2

Day 11 Update.  Slept decent again last night.  Ive been going to sleep around 11 P.M. and waking up around 6 for the last 3 days.  I can sleep through most of the night, but I wake up wired at 6 A.M.. 

I have developed a dry cough over the last 48 hours which seems to be a symptom of withdrawal.  I read through a bunch of posts here indicating that lots of people do get a dry cough after stopping. Its strange that it didn't show up till day 10, hopefully it doesn't last to long.  I am still sneezing from the withdrawal so now I have a cough / sneeze both dry.  This is obviously not ideal during covid... though ill take it over the other symptoms. 

Still wake up with a bit of a panic feeling and RLS, but its minimal at this point.  Just feels like a bunch of energy build up and I need to get up and walk around for it to go away. 

Did a 3.5 mile run today which felt pretty good.  Ive been running for the last 5-6 years consistently so it was easy for me to get into.  Though today was the first run in almost 2 weeks that felt good.  

Overall today I do feel better.  If yesterday I was at 75% today I am at 80% which is a nice boost.  

tomorrow I am heading south to some warmer weather for 3-4 weeks.   Which will give me sometime to work on myself physically and emotionally. I have been getting tired pretty easily, but it might just be from waking up at 6 A.M. so by 2  I am ready for a nap. 

Extremely happy I decided to jump when I did.  This will really allow me to start the new year right.   I guess if there was any year to relapse 2020 was the year. 

We Can Do It

Edit: Just wanted to add that today was my first really good day since quitting.  Id say for the majority of the day I was not thinking about kratom or w/d and enjoyed myself.",8

I’m over kratom in my prefrontal cortex, but my limbic system is still very interested in freaking out over nothing (depression and anxiety). I’ve been using delta-8 thc to help with my transitioning of medications that will hopefully be helping my brain to calm down (I’m on duloxetine , gabapentin, cariprazine, and methylphenidate). Everything is getting incredibly better incredibly fast, however. I have delved into being productive with work, exercise, and my spirituality to help manage my less pleasant emotions. That being said, ever since the winter solstice (not too long ago, I know), my body and mind have started to work better together, and my net mood quality is much higher than it was two weeks ago. I thank my regular meds, my delta-8 thc use, therapy, and my lifestyle for this change in pace; this current state of affairs has all painstakingly been in the making without me knowing it for over three months since quitting. I’m not saying things won’t change either, but I am appreciating this relatively stable period while I have it.

My advice as someone who’s gone over three months is this: 

- do not hesitate to ask for help (parents, friends, counselors, psychiatrists, and maybe even rehab in some cases are all great sources of help)
- prioritize your mental well-being (let’s face it, someone who is in recovery from a serious substance abuse problem is not prone to prolonged states of mental wellness, so please please please indulge in whatever mental and physical self care practices you might have)
- DO NOT encourage anyone else going down this rabbit hole (warn anyone who you are speaking to about kratom who is not familiar just how dangerous the substance can be and how addictive it can be; friends warn friends about possibly making life-ruining decisions, such as trying kratom)",7

Yesterday was rough. The last 3 days I slept very little. Like 3 hours horribly interrupted sleep a night. By yesterday I was hallucinating slightly which happens typically after 3 nights of little sleep. I've dealt with insomnia for my entire life. Needless to say my mood and spirits were shit. Watched a lot of funny stuff on Netflix, relaxed, and spent a fair amount just sitting overlooking a meadow. The sun helps even though the freezing weather makes my shivers worse.

I feel like I finally turned a major corner. This recovery is similar to a slightly heavier one years back. Day 13 or 14 I really felt better. I slept like 9 hours last night which is rare for me.

Keep going. There are portions I just have to break it down by the hour. Good natural feelings are returning. Sex drive is back. Feeling a clear heading feeling and awareness that havent been felt in a while.

I'm going to continue to focus on me while the rest of the world burns.

I’m quitting a 3 year habit, taking an obscene amount every day (between 60-75 g a day). I have rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia, so I used it to treat my pain as an alternative to opiates (which I was prescribed for 3 years before quitting cold turkey). I’m sick of blowing my money every week for minimal pain relief. I’ve become completely apathetic about everything while taking the Kratom. I have lost interest in everything I used to be interested in. I quit around this time last year, and I ended up in a full blown flare, in incredible pain, and so I went right back to it. This time, I have a supportive boyfriend that’s going to help me through it. 

Money is super tight, so I haven’t bought any supplements. Any suggestions on what is worth buying to help? Also, any advice on CBD? I have gummies that have a touch of THC in them. I don’t particularly enjoy getting high, so I’m not replacing one for the other, but am hoping that will help with some of the symptoms. 

I should also add that I take Xanax for insomnia and anxiety, and I know that taking an extra half here and there will help with the twitchiness. 

My biggest complaint about the withdrawal period is the sweating. Any recommendations for anything that will help? Also, I have terrible IBS, which is going to flare very quickly. Do I just stick with Imodium?

I’ve been on a 20gpd on average for 2-3 years. I started taking it in small doses to help me with the stress at work and it slowly escalated to me taking kratom every fourth hour every day like clockwork.

I know that in the beginning I thought that it was a miracle drug, it helped me with being more productive and social and after a while I thought I wouldn’t be “myself” without it.

I don’t remember at what point it went from being “helpful” (at least what I thought at the time) to being like living in a prison filled with anxiety and pain. 
It’s hard to describe my state of mind in the last six months of using, a lot of it feels like a blur. Everyday it felt like my heart was pounding out of my chest and I could break down in tears just from thinking about how I couldn’t make myself quit.
I had no motivation to do anything and I continued to find excuse after excuse to not being able to quit just yet.

The night I decided to quit CT I was just about to order a new batch and I said f*ck it. It’s time.
I turned to this subreddit and even if it gave me anxiety knowing I’d be going through hell for a time to come it gave me a lot of motivation to finally quit seeing how all of you are fighting the same battle and supporting each other along the way.

I’ve now been of kratom for 13 days and it feels like I finally see the world in vibrant colors again from living in a dark cloud.
Weirdly enough I haven’t had any cravings for kratom since I quit, it feels like I’m done with it for good.

For people thinking about quitting, do it.
Don’t wait for the perfect timing or tell yourself that you’re gonna wait another week. Now is the time and you’re not going to regret it.

Boy was I being naive. 52-96 hours was the worst of it. Very different from oxy/dilaudid/fent much longer but way way way less intense. I dunno what they put in kratom extract but the withdrawal is so unique I feel like I’m coming off hydrocodone and amphetamines at the same time. 

But I’m past the worst of it now. 12 days in and some of my natural energy is starting to return. My wallet is much fatter already. I’ve already saved $330 in this last week and a half. I went back to work on day 8 and it was rough. Even now I’m still experiencing fatigue, diarrhea, cold chills. anxiety and restlessness but it’s about a 2/10 compared to before. but that stuff’s not so bad compared to the bouts of depression I’ve been experiencing. Apathy and anhedonia is to be expected. I’m simply trying to keep myself busy but it’s super hard with the COVID lockdown. There’s not much to do except take long walks, go to work, and spend time with my girlfriend playing video games or watching movies (she’s the best and has been endlessly supportive) maintaining sobriety was much easier pre-covid. I can’t satisfy my cravings for opis with kratom anymore, and the inactivity during lockdown is making my cravings worse.  Right now I’m just snitching on myself to my girlfriend every time I get a craving. It helps some.  But i know it’s not enough. Right now I’m white-knuckling it and I don’t like that. I miss in person meetings. I miss hanging out with people and going on adventures to get the most out of sober life. What a painful and lonely time to be an addict.

Day 10 today.  Officially 240+ hours clean.  I have been off all helper meds also now for about 4+ days.  Compared to where I was a week ago I am doing MUCH MUCH better, but still probably only at 75%.  Id say almost 90% physically, but 60% mentally.   I feel as if each 10 day period will be a good measurement so 10 days is a big mile stone. 

Overall today feeling about the same as yesterday. Still a little restlessness, sneezing and a lot of boredom.  Been extremely lazy today just relaxing for most of the day. Gonna try to do some cleaning / a small workout later this afternoon. 

Its strange cause days 2-7 I really didn't have any thoughts about Kratom, likely because of the acutes.  The pull hasnt been so strong that Im acting on it, but i definitely have had thoughts the last couple of days. 

I know at this point it will just be time that will make me feel better.

Long story short, upon arriving back from my blessed getaway in Europe I flushed my remaining K down the drain. Less then a week later I got in a nasty car accident while my friend was passenger. After surgery for a broken arm I was given a 2 week long script of oxy10s. He also got a script for a broken jaw he got. Well that came to an end and I was back to square one fiending and longing to get high. I thought I had done so well quitting K, but after a couple days of smoking copious amounts of weed after the pills I longed something ‘stronger’. I tried so hard not to but my inner demon came out and I broke, going to the smoke shop where I picked up 100 grams of red maengda powder. Lasted me about 4 days. My use started Skyrocketing after that and I started ordering kilos online, shipped to my house. I am the worst version of myself right now and a kilo lasts me 10 days until recently. I’m back abroad and really going through it because I have no helper meds or people to talk to. My hair damage and loss, libido, shattered friendships and newly introverted nature have taken control of my life. I’m sweating like crazy at night, shivering, and shaking going to eat with my family and just feel the most depressed and anxious I’ve ever been. My sleep has gone out the window. It’s crazy how our brains play such awful tricks on us. Y’all were great support a couple months ago and I’m NEVER going back there again when I get back. Quit the first time because it only gets worse the following time. I’m holding myself accountable this time on here. Kratom doesn’t get me high anymore and is depleting my physiological and financial state. I just want to be free from my demons... so learn from my mistake. May we all be free in 2021 and god bless you.",22

The only reason I really ever started taking kratom was a replacement from my actual DOC (heroin). I really don’t like that I feel like I’ve been getting hooked the same way I felt on that. I was a 1g a day IV user, and went through terrible withdrawals for about a week or two. Post accuse withdrawals lasted for two years. I was in a halfway house so I didn’t touch anything. 
Anyways with kratom from the get go I felt a boost of energy, not even so much euphoria per say. 

Anyways, I have a baby on the way, and me and my girl are going to get off of it. We don’t want to he hooked when the baby is born, or effecting the baby at all. 
Can y’all tell me 1. How long the withdrawals last, 2. If you have used H on the last like myself, how similar the withdrawals are, and 3. Is there anything you’d suggest to help curve the withdrawals? (I got some lava, because I was told that’ll help the anxiousness and difficulty sleeping)

2020-12-25 21:30:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/kkaui8/91_days/,91 days!!!,"Apologies for the long post. I've drawn so much strength from the countless people on here with the bravery to log their progress. Everyone on this sub is absolutely brave and badass. 

I've been meaning to post on aesthetically pleasing numbers but one of the things you'll learn as you come off is that the reliability of having 'good' and 'bad' days is a substance-dependant thing. My number days - 30, 60, 45 etc. were days I felt restless: days I felt I could have felt better, so I kept holding out before I made a long post. But experiencing bad days and learning not to fight against them is a seminal thing you'll experience as you come off. Unadulterated bad days; holding them close and appreciating discomfort as more weapons in your arsenal. The feeling of not having kratom to weather yourself through what used to be easily interchangeable moods is difficult. Accepting that living - real living on a spectrum of emotions - involves letting go of that method of control is key in giving up. 

Better things: I'm three months off a two and a half year K habit which followed a six year hard opiate dependency. In what's relatively a tiny amount of time my skin and hair look incredible. My complexion's clear and even, my eyes look bright and my hair's thick and glossy again. For the first time in ages I feel attractive. I'm not alternately freezing or boiling. I can wear a fucking vest. My stamina is returning - I'm doing strength training, can see my musculature developing and it doesn't take me half an hour to drag myself out of bed to perform menial tasks. On kratom I ran in thirty second bursts.  That was my limit. Now I'm running two kilometres in ten minutes, working out four times a week and lifting more than I ever could manage on shitty opiate combos and derivatives.  

Kratom ostensibly solved a lot of the problems I had socialising. I had awful social anxiety and started popping valium a few years ago. That worked for about six months and then my personality dribbled away. Kratom seemed to solve that. I was scared that off both I'd be absolutely useless but - surprise - kratom robs us of our spontaneity and wit. Kratom is great at killing shame and remorse. You can bob along saying anything at work or at parties because you literally don't care what is it that you're saying. It's horrible for empathy, engagement and the desire to pursue friendships. I haven't laughed as much in years as I have with the friends I've been able to see despite lockdown. It's fucking beautiful. 

For anyone worried about their hobbies returning, please remember that patience is key. I remember during my first week off kratom I was travelling on a train listening to Thee Oh Sees. It wasn't until the absolutely phenomenal chorus of a song that it struck me that I hadn't just not enjoyed a song in the best part of a year - I hadn't bothered listening to music. I'm not one for anthropomorphising a plant but man it's a sneaky fucking drug. The first year we're on it we might still be creative. A lot of people on here talk about productivity and while that's true: it might boost how readily we engage with tasks we'd rather not do, after a short time our capacity for original, enthused thoughts is diminished, 

I realised three weeks into my CT quit that I'm a polysubstance addict. I don't want to corner anyone else but for my personally it took stopping weed, booze, ket and anything narcotic before I started to heal. Your brain needs rest. Neuroplasticity is an incredibly thing but it requires time and patience. If you feel up to it do a little every day - pick up a pencil or your old guitar. Anhedonia is transient. It feels like it'll last forever but it really ends. Exercise is addictive in the best way. As is falling back in love with your old hobbies. Quitting feels like wiping the dust off an old picture and realising that beneath the glass is something stunning that you never quite appreciated before. 

If you're just starting out you're going to feel like a piece of origami in the next couple of months. You won't necessarily know what you'll become as you unfold but each crease and pull outwards will reveal so much - so much of what you'll become. I used to wake up, stumble RLS-ridden into the kitchen and mix a cup of green sludge. Days melted together. I was getting nowhere. Now I get up at the same time, have a black coffee and a cold shower. I finished my degree, I'm off benzos and (for a girl) my abs are looking fantastic. And every morning I have this resounding feeling that the day is mine. It belongs to me, I'm in control. Even if all you do is get through the day that's huge. What you're doing is enough. It's been a crazy year for everyone. You are all that you need. 

I fully expect it to be another three months before I feel 'normal' again. I used to feel grateful to kratom for how I felt it benefited me. Now I feel grateful to myself for what I've leant from quitting it. When you're coming off you should pay really close attention to how you feel physically and mentally. The first week or so is hard but even then I started actually feeling real emotions as opposed to this weird plateau kratom saddles us at. Be kind to yourself because what you're doing is so brave. There is very little public support for kratom abstinence because it's still so obscure in the media. There'll be no medals, no sober chips. But wherever you're at you'll get love here. I posted a few times when I was close to relapsing and always got support. This sub is incredible. The long term quitters who keep coming back deserve all the accolades :) Also-  if you can - be honest with the people closest to you. I know it's not always possible but having your best friend or partner tell you they're proud of you is a wonderful feeling. 

Sorry for the long post. The last thing I want is to song egotistical. I've been coming here every day and I'm so, so grateful to everyone who's shared because it kept me going the times I was romanticising a drug that was dragging me the fuck down. Quit, stay the fuck quit and if you're right at the start you're gonna wake up one day and see the world in all its colours <3",21

Anyone know when the sneezing / other symptoms usually start to dissipate ? I am going to be visiting family in 2 days and I know the sneezing will probably make them nervous with covid... Going on vacation Monday which will be day 12. 

Great news is that I've been sleeping.  Last night i slept from like 11 - 7 with almost no interruption.  I didn't expect the sleep like this so early on.  I think this is likely due to the exercise routine ive been pushing through.  Today I did a 15 minute core exercise followed by a 3 mile run.  I hate it in the moment, but feel much much much better after (now). 

Lastly, I had some helper meds left over xanax, adderall and kratom.  They all went in the garbage today which was a big step.",6

I recently relapsed Labor Day week end. My use caused me to neglect my ex and my behavior pushed her away. She finally left. I had bought w ring for her and everything. Except the day she left she was crying and begging for me to not break up with her. I still proceeded to tell her to get the hell out of my life forever and I left. Well she took it serious and she left.. her parents came to help her with getting her stuff and there was Kratom everywhere. They basically told her to never speak to me again (she had a kid). I’m so guilty and angry at myself for this. I’m so depressed rn. 

I’m forced to stay home alone for Christmas this year as my siblings have decided that I’m unstable and don’t get why I use drugs. They won’t show up if I do bc they consider me a crazy addict and think addiction is just a character flaw.  I’m so depressed, lost and alone right now... I hate myself for this life I’ve ruined. 

I took to AMITA on Reddit and they grilled me for being an addict. Saying how they understand why my brother would hate me (even though he has hated me for 10 years) and that I shouldn’t be around anyone right now as it’s “not safe”. Acting like because I used Kratom or drugs I should be put in a mental hospital. 

I understand you have to take responsibility for your actions while high but I did not understand why they were treating me so poorly for even existing with this problem. I don’t understand? 

I’m also 2 weeks off Kratom.",8

After coming out to my wife a few months ago about me using again, she said enough’s enough. She can’t handle a drug user in her life and she doesn’t want that around our son. This would be the last time she would put up with it. If I did it again, I was out and she was selling the house. She said as punishment I would be spending my weekends working on house projects to get it ready to go on the market, just in case, because she knows I was gonna screw up. Well, I did. She went into the hospital and had surgery, a bunch of shit went wrong and she almost died, then was in recovery for two months. Meaning I was left to work all day and keep up with the house and our son before and after, and continue house projects on the weekend. I couldn’t keep up. On day two of her recovery I was already exhausted from working, worrying about her, taking care of our son, etc. So, she told me I wasn’t doing the best job taking care of her and I gotta step it up because she can’t do anything for weeks to months. I knew of only one way to “step it up.” So, I started with little doses and it just escalated from there. 

Well, here I am. Another Christmas and hooked on this crap again. My goal is to quit starting tomorrow, but I’m terrified she will find out I’ve been using this whole time. My main issue is fatigue. She spots that if I’m extra tired, I must be using the stuff. That’s how she caught me before. So, I’m gonna try being loaded up on caffeine and see if that helps so it’s not as obvious. I HATE lying or hiding things from her, but there’s no way I would’ve made it through these past 5 months without this stuff, else my brains would’ve been on the wall somewhere! 

Good luck to all those that are quitting. Do better than me: stop for good! Now I have to prepare to get an attorney because I know what’s coming. She doesn’t understand or tolerate addiction, or that K has been the only thing that has helped me with the stresses of life. So, it’s inevitable this time. I will lose the family I LOVE just because of some powdered green shit. Life just sucks.",5

Started w Norcos, turned to subs to quit those, turned to kratom to quit subs, and here I am 5 years later still addicted. Fuck. So I’m done. Seriously I need my life back. 5 shots of OPMS a day. From the moment I wake up, to the moment I fall asleep, I’m high in kratom. I’m a business owner and fortunately my finances are good so I can drop the $75-$100 on the OPMS shots a day. But I’m over it. Moving w the wife to Miami Beach for a few months in 10 days. And would like to not be high when we make the 21 hour drive. 

When I quit ct norcos in the last, by day 3 I felt 100% normal. No aches or anything. But got back into them out of boredom then after a few years turned to subs to quit. Tapered off subs, and had paws for maybe 3-4 days. RLS all the BS. Mental part was the worst that lasted for a couple weeks.

So I’m trying to figure out which is the best way to proceed. I’m on subs now, haven’t taken kratom since Sunday, the 20th.

I have a feeling though, my paws on subs this time around are gonna be a lot worse considering the Amount of time I’ve been getting high compared to last time I quit subs.

So taper of kratom? CT kratom and get it tf over with? Taper off subs? Idkkkkk. Sounds like sub wds would be worse/longer from what I’m reading. 

Wife doesn’t know. Nobody knows. I’m in this literally alone. Last time I wd off the subs she knew about my usage, so her helping me was great. But since then her little brother died of an OD. And for her sake I can’t let her know her husband is also using again. So yeah, I’m alone in this. I can handle the pain and all the other bs. I’m just trying to keep it to a minimum. And idk if I can actually feel fine by January 4th to make that drive. Imagine being stuck in a car for two days while wding lmao yeah right. So idk. Help me pleaseeee world help me. I just want to be CLEAN. Thoughts? Suggestions?",7

It was brutal with physiological withdrawal symptoms, but it especially hit me hard psychologically and I was slipping into very dark places, unable to really take care of myself. Decided to give tapering a shot this Wednesday, but I’m really worried that my stomach won’t be able to recover (in turn affecting my mood), or will keep getting worse.

Been a lurker here for a while but this is my first post. I have been reading this subreddit and gaining inspiration for quite some time to prepare myself to finally kick this habit that has been slowly leaching my soul for too too long. For about the past 2 years I had been between 20-40 gpd. The last couple of months I have managed to taper down to 15-20 gpd. However my taper has hit a plateau and I feel like the only way forward at this point is to cold turkey. 

I started taking kratom a number of years ago as an occasional boost for socializing/productivity/etc. But it eventually turned into an everyday thing and slowly but surely I needed it just to get out of bed in the morning. Eventually of course, I stopped feeling that euphoric high and was just taking it to feel normal and functional at that point. 

I have dealt with a significant amount of depression and anxiety for a large part of my life and so at certain point I think I was just trying to self medicate those things with kratom. Of course it worked for a while, but then the addiction eventually consumed me and everything about my day became related to kratom and when I was gonna take my next dose, etc... 

I have tried to taper as well at CT a number of times in the past without a great deal of success, but this is by far my most serious attempt. Starting on Saturday I will CT and no longer take any more. Going to sprinkle the rest of powder I have into my yard on Friday night. I have acquired a number of supplements and herbs to help me along in the process including - 

\-black seed oil (to help with W/D)

\-reishi, lions mane (adaptogens)

\-magnesium (calming)

\-passionflower, valerian (calming and sleep)

\-milk thistle (to help with detox)

\-various herbal teas including tulsi, licorice root, etc.

\-kava (for anxiety)

\-l-theanine (for calm energy/focus)

\-matcha (for energy plus the flavor and texture are kind of reminiscent of kratom so hey maybe it'll trick my brain)

Also, I'm going to try and do yoga and/or excercise or movement everyday or as much as possible. Going to try and keep my mind busy with hobbies, entertainment, video games, cooking, playing music, etc.  I have a feeling it's going to be very difficult to motivate myself to actually do any of those things, so we'll see how it goes. Also, going to try and get out of the house every once in a while so that I'm not just stuck with my own thoughts all the time. Also, downloaded insight timer app for guided meditations.

Wish me luck! Ya'll have any more advice or tips for me?",11

Simple diet of miso soup, rice, greens, mushrooms, and fermented foods . Lots of bone broth and plenty of ginger and milk thistle and probiotics . All this heals the gut and returns the biome back to a healthy place which intern creates serotonin.

A gallon of water everyday with lemon and sea salt. Lots of liver cleansing tea and ginger tea. 

Enemas, sounds gross but trust me it will change your life. Only twice a week though. Plus psyllium husk to cleanse the colon.

Hot hot baths to sweat it out with epson salts. 

Lots of exercise and wim hoff. Yoga yoga yoga and more fucking yoga , god it feels amazing!

Most important is lots of prayer and self work. Reading the book the body keeps score. It’s about trauma being stored in the body. It’s incredible! Most likely you are an addict because of trauma in your past or present.

2020-12-24 15:30:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/kjm98j/day_8/,Day 8,"Hi All,

Daily update! Another day passed clean.  To be honest today is pretty similar to yesterday.  If yesterday I felt 70% today I feel 71%.  I have a feeling it will be like that for a while. 

Overall just trying to keep busy.  Funny cause the holidays are supposed to be a time to relax, but that’s probably the worst thing I can be doing.  

This morning I woke up around 7. Started my day with a run.  I highly recommend exercise to anyone who is active. The last few days the exercise definitely helps me feel basically normal during and the few hours after.  Current symptoms are basically the same as yesterday.  Though the lower back pain and head aches seem to have passed.  

At this point from the physical symptoms there is no way i would go back to kratom. I know the mental game will be much harder, but that part luckily hasn’t really hit yet. The point of the above statement is that on day 8 physical symptoms are not so bad more just annoying.  Like each day I keep hoping the next day they are gone, but they linger just a bit. 

Sleep is 6/10 but I’m sleeping enough.  

My advice to those who are tapering or thinking about going ct soon would be this: get into an exercise routine before jumping. This way after the initial 2-3 days you can push yourself to continue that routine. Exercise has been by far the best medicine for this experience.  It actually distracts you from the withdrawals and has you feeling close to normal afterwards. 

Happy holidays all!",7

I took it randomly a few times a week and I was probably taking too much for a beginner (I took 4g per dose) as the first like 5 times every time I would vomit so I left it alone for weeks as I didn’t care for it. Around April I realised it was lying in my room and I noticed my weed tolerance was quite high and I had read somewhere kratom helps save money on weed as you need less weed for the same or higher effects while on kratom so I gave it a go as I still had the kratom packet lying in my room and then I got hooked, I took weed for my anxiety and kratom definitely helped me save money on weed.  Even tho I was taking 4-8 grams of kratom per day for a while I somehow wasn’t Thaaat dependent on it in the sense that when I ran out and stopped to come home from uni for the summer holidays I felt fine just had some flu like symptoms I could have stopped there and I would have been fine but me being naive after 3 days of no Kratom and feeling perfectly fine decided to order some more end of June and thats where things went downhill.

I began taking kratom everyday even if I didn’t need it I just enjoyed the slight high and it made me feel like my old self again before my anxiety/depression and it seemed harmless and I still think its an awesome substance for opiate addicts and people in pain but for someone like me there is no need to become unnecessarily addicted to it. So many times over the summer Id run out of kratom and averaging 8grams per day the withdrawals werent too bad the first few times it was just uncomfortableness flu like symptoms and some mild diarrhea so I didn’t think much of it, eventually my tolerance increased to 10+ grams perday and everytime I ran out I would go through mild opiod like withdrawals so the body aches, sweating, cold flashes, skin crawling and thats when I realised I had f’ed up so Id wait a few days in mild pain but managable till my next order arrived. I knew exactly what had happened my body and mind were completely dependent now and if I stopped cold turkey I would he in withdrawal, altho probably nothing like opiate withdrawal still pretty uncomfortable. Many times I got out of the withdrawal after a few days and felt fine but still continued to start taking some more. 

Fast forward to December I had ran out and I was taking probably 15-20g per day and the 36 hrs I didn’t have any I went through the worst kratom withdrawals ever it was literally lowkey hell. When my next batch came I knew I couldn’t afford anymore and didn’t want to continue taking anymore so I began a quick taper over 2 weeks going down from 10 to 8 to 5 to around 3-4g on my last day then jumped off from 0.8 grams the following morning. It was uncomfortable but nothing like cold turkey and now im 2-3 days kratom
Free and im so glad i did it as painlessly as possible yes I still had withdrawals and sweats and depression but it was nowhere near as bad as CT and didn’t last anywhere near as long the only thing I used was blackseed oil and one ibuprofen day 2 to help and now im slowly but surely starting to feel like myself again I know I will have paws and stuff probably but im just glad im finally free whew tysm for reading and I wish everyone trying to quit the best of luck you got this!",23

Ive turned into a depressed dead beat it seems. Always preoccupied. Not engaging much with my daughter even though desperately wanting to. No job. Life is unmanageable.  The only way i have a fighting chance at a meaningful life is to get clean and sober. Im so scared of being depressed if im not on something. Im scared of everything. But ive got to fight. This can all be just a bad dream. Out of kratom and no way to get it. No turning back.

Ill start with whats good. Colors are certainly brighter. Been getting random bursts of genuine laughter which is nice. Been doing wim hof exercises by accident really. Im a smoker and its been below zero out. Runny nose. Had jerky light sleep. 

On my way to get my sisters gabapentin script so im hoping thatll help. Been taking vitamin C at high doses. 

So i guess we will see. No turning back. Much love, y'all",11

This is my fourth (and final) attempt at quitting kratom. I've been using daily for about 6 years around 30-50g. I had a bit of a mental health crisis this year and lost my job, house and partner of 10 years in less than a month. My doctor won't give me antidepressants until I quit the K. He recommended suboxone but is not authorized to prescribe it.

I went to a different clinic to get suboxone but the doctor had never heard of kratom and didn't seem to believe that it was the only opiate I was on. They prescribed me 8mg twice a day which after my first dose I know is WAAAY too much. I cut it down to 2mg but it still seems like too much. 

Anyone have any experiences they could share? It is helping my withdrawal symptoms and I am functioning reasonably well on day 2. The last time I quit I spent all of day two crying curled up in a ball on the floor of the shower. I couldn't find much info online about suboxone dosage for K withdrawal. Any stories or pointers would be super helpful.  I am very determined to get better this time. I can't build a whole new life only to have it fall apart AGAIN due to depression.",3

I’m pretty used to delayed gratification, (as much as an addict can experience) and really struggling with finding that thing I can do that’ll make me feel relaxed and rewarded after a hard days work of battling the kratom demon. It feels as though I’ve been working 24/7 for 20 days and I’m really ready for a break haha.  I know this is part of the process and that I won’t get a break until my brain decides it’s time, so not really looking for advice. Just needed to vent.

My SNRI and ADHD meds barely work and I'm on pretty high doses of both. One day last week I noticed if I went longer between doses I got more from my meds, which I really need. I've tried quitting before but I don't think I was every ready. 

I am on day 3 of a rapid taper. Today I only took 25 grams. I saved most of them for the evening so I could do nightly chores and get good quality sleep. I credit magnesium, lysine and theanine for my fairly stable frame of mind, though yesterday I cried a lot. 
I have tyrosine, vitamin d, fish oily, a multi, and a bcomplex arriving shortly to help me get through the rest of the rapid taper. 

I am sweating a lot and experiencing the fluctuating body temperature as well as the depression. My SNRI seems to stave off the anxiety enough to make it bearable so far. 
I just want to keep going lower and lower until it's done. I'm so ready to be done, and I'd quit QT if I didn't have 4 children and a partner with a heavy workload. 

I think I am just here to ask that you please tell me I can do this. I want this more than anything. My hormones are fucked up, I havent had a cycle in months and not because I'm pregnant. I have acne and my hair is thinning. I need myself back and so does my family.

I made it a week and I do feel much better then I did 4-5 days ago.  

Current Symptoms: 

* Sweats 
* Slight RLS (feels like a build up of energy)
* diarrhea
* Lack of motivation 
* lower back pain in waves 
* head ache in waves 
* Heart pounding when I wake up.  Extreme anxiety like heart pounding, but only right when I wake up
* sneezing

Today was my first almost normal day since quitting. I woke up around 7:30 ate a breakfast which is unusual as usually id wait till 1 P.M. to eat to make sure the Kratom hits. Then went for a 4 Mile run which really had me feeling good for a while after.  I almost forgot about the w/d for like 3-4 hours after which was nice.  Then I met up with a friend and had some lunch. 

Overall today was a good day and I can feel myself getting a little bit closer to normal.  Im sure by this time next week ill be well past the acutes.  My plan is to keep the exercise daily for a long time.  I need to retrain myself to do healthy things. 

The most exciting news is that I slept without a sleep aid last night. I had used small doses of Xanax .25 - .5 the first 5-6 nights.  Someone recommended some sleep meditation on here and it did wonders. As soon as I closed my eyes last night my brain started going crazy with thoughts.  The meditation calmed me down and actually put me to sleep for the entire night. 

Going on vacation starting Monday (well visiting family in the southern US to get out of the cold North) for probably 3-4 weeks.  So my plan was to hopefully be way past acutes so I can just work on myself mentally and physically on vacation.  If anyone has any good resources for structure and rebuilding one self, please let me know. Thanks for the support.

We can do it!",8

On Friday I took a low dose of methadone and then took a hit of weed later in the night. 

Saturday I took adderall 

Sunday I took even lower dose of methadone 

Monday I took some adderall and have only been smoking weed since.

So many people have experienced relapse and so have I (once) but this time I haven't had a single craving for extra kratom since I started the taper and I really don't feel the need to relapse. BUT

I would like to know the experience of the few people who have managed to do a single ""higher"" dose relapse and then came back to usual taper dose. I want to understand how far does it set you back in regards to the symptoms. It's really just to understand the mechanism of the neurological side of things.

I know this might sound like me rationalizing dosing more but trust me, it isn't. I'm dead set on getting to the end of the whole struggle and really proud of myself for not cheating once when it comes to GPD, I have cheated in the sense of taking the planned dose 1-2 hours early because of social gatherings but always waited for the appropriate time to get the next dose :)

TLDR: If you managed to relapse in a way you took just one larger dose, how far has it set you back in the tapering sense?",1

I managed to do this all on my own, keeping a secret from all those I'm closest to. Only the salesman at the head shop is aware of my use. Like many of you, I'm a professional who got sucked into this plant. I'm also an herbalist who knows the danger of some plants, so I'm not sure how I got here but I'm proud I got myself out.

Meet with my therapist today. Really don’t have any major, pressing issues for the first time since quitting. Not 100% sure what to talk about but I’m sure something will come up. Have been meeting every 2 weeks but I think I’m in a good enough spot to move to monthly meetings - more frequently if something comes up. Therapy has been invaluable in working through my feelings and giving another layer of accountability to not use.

Sleep is not great I wake every hour and a half. Sweating seems to have stopped which is good! Nothing worse than waking up soaked. 
My appetite is massive, carnt seem to get full! Am eating healthy tho, massive salads and tons of protein.
Still feeling very fatigued through out the day. Having to force my self on to the exercise bike I do at least 30 mins no matter weather it’s fast or slow I get it done. 
 Still feel lost most of the time like I don’t know what to do with my self. I don’t want to socialise at all. 
But the worst thing is the last few days my anxiety and depression have been really bad. The depression is like a black cloud that just won’t fuck off. The anxiety’s HEAVY like I’m really really worried about something but there’s nothing I should be worried over. It’s to the point where I feel like I’m about to have a panic attack! Is this PAWS?? Sounds like it right? 
Hoping it is and that it will ease over time.

It’s all because I decided to do the work as rich cooper says. Can you believe since day 4 you have been working? That’s 22 days! Like wtf. How? I don’t know how I did it. I just knew I had a real strong feeling of disgust for myself. It’s not like I didn’t have this disgust in the past. What changed this time was a combination of tapering over time meaning quit for 30 days. Relapse. Quit for 60 days relapse. Over time I consumed less and learned how to live without it. Another major factor contributing to my success this time around was setting the precedent on day 4 to continue on with my life despite the pain. I’m on day 26 and I feel like I have wind in my sails. Compared to other quits where by day 26 I felt shitty because all I did was lay in bed or a couch the entire time feeling sorry for myself.

Today I didn’t think much of my body. I wrestled more with anger in my mind towards situations and people. Without K I have to learn how to manage anger better because in the past all I had to do was take a dose and not feel or care.  It’s all part of the process.",3

I’m finishing up day 11 CT. After day 5 mostly all physical WDs where gone. All except RLS. Today was the first time I actually slept more then 6 hours. I didn’t have work today so I went to bed around midnight. I woke up at 6 am for some reason and couldnt sleep. I fell asleep at 7 am and woke up at 10am. I did homework and mostly relaxed at home today. Then again I feel asleep at 2pm and woke up at 5pm. This is the first time in a really long time that I actually slept more then 6 hours. Today was overall a tough day. I was throwing up all night due some kind of stomach virus. So today I thought about buying kratom probably over 10 times lol. The reason behind this was because my whole body was hurting. But luckily I overcame those thoughts and pushed through it. Looking forward to feeling better tomorrow hopefully. Oh and whoever suggested buying black seed oil, I hate and love you. It helped me sleep but...... it tastes like complete shit. Like the after tastes is horrible. And this is coming from a guy who chugged cups of kratom everyday lol. But yea, goodluck everyone 😎",6

I have so much time off work with nothing to do that I end up getting High on kratom and laying in bed all day.  I feel so hopeless. I never make it past A few weeks Sober. 
   
  Right now my mind is thinking if going through withdrawals again is even worth it considering my track record with relapsing. I’m starting to lose my relationship with my only friend and roommate because I’m constantly angry and depressed at my predicament. This is this hardest thing I’ve ever done and I wish I could rewind back to 2018 and never try this shit..",2

I thought it was the best thing in the world. I loved everything and everybody after drinking it. Years later, while finishing college I remembered about it and decided to look for it. Meanwhile I was already so interested in all the mind altering substances. It felt like I wanted to escape myself, to always stay a bit high. I was also prescribed Adderall, after being diagnosed with ADD by psychiatrist. It actually helped me stop my eating disorder, but I don’t think it did anything else good for me. And I was also put on antidepressants, which I ended up mixing with other drugs which is kind of scary. 
Anyways, now I’m 26 and relapsed to using Kratom after going through rehab last year. I was actually pretty functional (or it seemed like it), until last few month, when I realized I’m going nowhere and I just couldn’t finish even simple tasks. I decided that I need to quit. Everything!  I am understanding now I have to be completely sober because I have 0 brakes when I start using any mind altering substance. The problem right now I don’t have insurance, and I can’t really afford a psychologist without it. I’m hoping that this community will help me build a strength to follow through on this. 
I stopped using this Sunday and I wanted to do CT. I was taking about 30 GPD. The problem is that my stomach is F up , and I think it’s adding to my overall feeling of being ill. I can push through the physical part, but it really affects my mind right now. Feels like the worst time to quite right on holidays, but I have no choice. I am thinking about tapering instead, maybe it won’t feel as rough. Because since I quit on Sunday I haven’t had a strength to do ANYTHING. Thankfully I have fiancé by my side who could keep me accountable with tapering, otherwise I wouldn’t risk it. Love reading everyone’s success stories!! Right now it just doesn’t seem like it will get better. Will I be able to deal with the pressures of life? I really hope so. I gotta try!!!",2

I wanted to check in as I've had the MOST INSANE month ever and let you know how my quit is going. 

So I was really struggling a long time ago with Kratom and now I haven't even thought about it whatsoever.  I quit on October 7th and had an entire week long detox that absolutely sucked.  However, I randomly decided to have breast augmentation surgery on Nov. 13th.  Then I popped a stitch 8 days in and started leaking fluid.  I ended up getting an infection and had to have a second surgery on Dec. 4th.  It has been one hell of a painful month.  But it dawned on me today I haven't even thought of kratom during all this time because I had so many other pressing concerns with being in pain and my health scare.

Today I am 17 days post op from my 2nd surgery and just had my stitches removed yesterday. I am not out of the woods yet. I need to ensure the infection is gone and I go back tomorrow for a follow up appt. 

Anyhow, if anything I can bring to the table with my experience it has been that this was an enormous distraction from kratom withdrawal and forgetting all about it.  I can't imagine taking it now and ever risking my health again.  God knows if my system still had kratom in my system that had anything to do with all of this insanity - who knows.  

Anyhow, much love to you all! You got this! Stay strong!",5

Feeling great.,"Life has its color back and it’s awesome! Completed the last of my registration stuff for college today and went on a nice long bike ride. 

I’m so excited to be going back into college which is a 180 degree turn from how I was on kratom; terrified of failure and in total self-doubt of my intellect (maybe because kratom slowed my brain to 50% intellectual function). 

Exercise is my new medicine. Every time I feel low or fatigued I jump on my bike or do a 30-minute round of calisthenics or do some yoga, and it almost always makes me feel emotionally, physically, and cognitively better right after. 

I really think exercise was the missing piece the last two times I tried to jump off. It has helped me tremendously. Hopefully I maintain this little workout regimen I’ve started. I need to for the sake of my well-being. 

Just wanted to check in and share some positivity! This sub is a huge help, thank you guys! Stick with it!!",17

This is my first time actually posting on here, I’ve read a lot of posts and I’ve tried quitting CT and Tapering multiple times but I can’t seem to get past the uncontrollable body temp fluctuations. That seems to be the most annoying withdrawal symptom I’ve had and it’s always around the 3rd or 4th day when I usually give in and buy more Kratom. I’m tired of this controlling my life and draining me mentally, physically, emotionally and financially. I have issues with self discipline, so tapering didn’t work out very well for me so I’ve decided to just go CT. I figured that all the other times I’ve tried to quit but failed is because I didn’t have anyone really motivating me so I wanted to see if anyone had any suggestions on supplements for the uncontrollable body temps? I’ve always struggled with depression as well so trying to keep myself motivated to quit is tough especially when Kratom would numb my emotions and my mind, it helped me with getting through each day and I actually got stuff done while on it but it’s not worth what it does to your body and mind in the long run. I could use some encouragement or motivation to actually stick to quitting this time instead of running to Kratom when it gets tough. I’m sorry if this is a long post but I figured I would try this out and hold myself accountable through this post on here. I will quit this time. I have to.",4

I would call it nerve pain or maybe it's inflamation, I dunno. It's like a pinch that will randomly pulse basically anywhere in my body. Commonly my wrist, arm and legs but also internally. It's a little bit painful but not torture. Annoying for sure

I know it has something to do with kratom because I have quit MANY times and it always stops about the 3rd day CT. I'm on another 3rd day and confident enough to issue this PSA: it's the kratom.

A little about my usage: I've used probably 10 years. I never measured but sometimes I was absolutely cavalier in my dosage. I've been quitting on and off for the last year. The pains aren't present when I begin to reuse. It takes a few days for the pinching to begin again. 30 minutes after my morning dose.

I know other people have experienced it. It is the kratom.

I’m on day 10 CT off about a 6mo 5-10gpd habit. (Tried to taper for a couple days and hated it so I just stopped, I guess technically not ct) I’m sensitive to most things and even quitting from my lower dose has definitely had some noticeable side effects. Restlessness, anxiety, and sleeplessness are the big ones, along with the sweats/chills. The latter has all but disappeared by now. I can’t remember the last time I got the chills but it’s been at least a couple days now. 

Last weekend I slept funny and woke up with severe neck pain. Tried to push through the weekend like normal only to realize how bad it really was and didn’t get much done. Kratom would have been helpful but honestly I didn’t have a hard time not taking it. I’m feeling the positive effects of not being on kratom too and that is worth pushing through it. 

Things are more pleasant. It’s easier to laugh. I’m delighted to come back to a purer form of myself. Supplements like black seed oil and (at night) melatonin are helping and we’re especially useful for getting through the first week. 

I saw someone else mention this on here... it’s not all aches and pains. Your sensitivity is coming back in a lot of really good ways too. Oddly enough, even at the very beginning when it really sucked, I noticed I had more patience. I may be feeling more pain and discomfort, but I’m also not as quick to run away from it. Or maybe I’m tired of running away from it. That’s what got me here... running away from things I should be experiencing. 

I dunno, food for though 🍴 

Hope everyone is doing well. Merry Christmas 🎄",20

Daily update time!  Made it to day 6 and feeling significantly better.  The worst of the acutes have definitely passed though I still feel them in small waves.  As of today the only major symptom I am still experiencing is cold sweats and RLS as night.  I have been using a small about of Xanax to sleep at night, but from here on out I plan to just toughen it out.  So today is the official first day of 0 substances.

This morning I went to the gym real early which felt great.  I actually felt pretty normal for the first few hours after that.  I do find when I wake up I’m hit with this feeling of dread and pounding heart that typically goes away as soon as I get up but it makes getting up that much harder. 

Excited for tomorrow as that will represent 1 week.  Thanks for reading all! 

We can do it!",9
2020-12-22 13:19:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/kiau4m/day_93_of_no_kratom/,Day 93 of NO KRATOM,"Day 93 of no kratom for me. Can't believe I've made it this far. I've tossed all the Kratom out of the house, and haven't had the desire to want any in a month or so. I also kicked nicotine (heavy e-cigarette usage) alongside the Kratom. I am now addicted to nothing.

MY successful strategy was an extremely slow taper, followed by a jump (I started my 'days without Kratom' counter with the jump). By extremely slow, I'm talking the height of my usage being about 30GPD in 3x/day doses, and reducing each dose by a tenth (0.1) of a gram per day/2 days, **consistently** (I bought a good scale). I'm not sure I've seen anyone else here do the extreme-slow taper like I did, but it definitely worked for me with little pain to speak of.

The taper took months, but it was easy to deal with. I didn't notice the such small reduction in my dosage. When I jumped, I was at about 1GPD (3x 0.3g doses) and my head was spinning a bit for about 2 days. On the third day, all my senses came back on full throttle. Since then, I've probably experienced about 3 instances of notable PAWS, but not strong enough to have me log back into my favorite e-retailer of Kratom and drum up an order.

If you're like me -- got sucked into the 'its a harmless herbal supplement/tea', and were addicted to nothing prior except maybe nicotine/caffeine, and realized you became totally dependent on Kratom and became scared. YOU CAN DO IT. Read through the success stories on this sub, figure out what might work for you, and put it into action for 2021!",56

 The acutes mainly over. Definitely having problems sleeping, which was my main problem pretty much throughout my life, so I am expecting this.  I can take gaba at night or a klonopin and I'll fall asleep and still wake up 3 or 4 hours later. 

 Then my wife is asleep and I am alone in the house and I start to get really lonely and bored and sad. I did play some music today which was nice.  I'm just relaxing now but I still have no energy in so much needs to be done around the house.  With the Christmas holiday everything is stressful combined with the pandemic in me having the quaratine everything is wild.

 I feel that a big part still missing my emotions are coming back online and I feel like I have so much to take care of its overwhelming given our current situation with finances. Government  gave 1200 and that was rent for a month, but now I'm not supposed to go to work. How am I gonna bay bills and but food?

Im so angry at the US 🇺🇸 government.

Sorry for ranting having a hard time and I could literally throw a tennis ball and hit the store that sells kratom. Its that close.

I was probably using up to 60-70g a day this time after promising myself I would not use more than 15g. You can only roll the dice so many times before you crap out. 

The shitty thing is, I cannot taper kratom at these mega dosages without screwing it up. All it takes is one toxic mid day nap for me to take more than I should and flush weeks of progress down the peeshadoo. It is because of the short half life of 7-OH-M.

My only option is cold turkey and some meds. I use Subutex and memantine. I am only on 0.37mg of Subutex and I made sure to taper down fast but I need to taper the rest of the Subutex at a reasonable pace because last time I failed and went back to kratom. So I plan on being on these minuscule doses another month. I will go to 0.25mg of Subutex in a few days and take it from there. I’m hurting a little bit but it isn’t that bad with the Subutex and 5mg of memantine. I may use a very small dose of tianeptine sulfate soon as well but 25mg at the most. I ordered some and feel a lot of hesitation to add it to my stack of meds here. I don’t want to get addicted to tianeptine again either but I got addicted to tianeptine sodium which is more prone to redosing. I never took more than 100mg in the past but tianeptine can be a nasty drug. Use with caution. Tianeptine sodium is the most addictive formulation. The thing about tianeptine though is  it really helps for quitting kratom at low dosages and I want to stay off the sludge this time. So I ordered a gram of the tia sulfate. I plan to be off all meds and drugs in about 6 weeks. Then I may get a few IV NAD+ infusions at this clinic to heal faster. That’s a big maybe though",8

I had a little sludge making station in her bathroom that I was hiding from her then she found it and all hell broke loose lol.

Initial withdrawal symptoms were as expected: severe indigestion, bowel issues, sleep issues, and exasperated mood issues. I was using a litany of supplements to help with most of that; but have paired those down considerably as well.

At this point: I feel like I finally have my head on straight, and am beginning to take positive steps toward bettering my everyday life. 

That said - the bowel issues haven’t let up. Imodium provides relief when taken for a day or two at a time; but then it’s back to constant, loose, watery BMs.

Gross imagery aside: when did the withdrawal symptoms finally stop for *you*? Were there any steps you took that successfully sped up or helped the process?

I was at my witts end.  Had only been taking Kratom for 9 weeks, but was up to taking 4-6 liquid extracts a day.  For the past month have ""tried"" to quit, each day, yet each day failing.  I felt lost, broken, beaten.   I could never make it to the 24 hour mark.  Not because of the physical withdrawals but the mental anguish, cravings, accesibility.

This past weekend I reached out to my father and asked him not to let me out of his site for a couple days.  Still found a way to get some the next day.  Truly not wanting to, but my addict mind took over and bam, there i went.

I had a vivitrol shot scheduled for this coming wednesday and the doc scribed me some pill for of naltrexone.  I had read the horror stories of parcipitated withdrawls, but i didnt care.  I needed something to get it over with and make it impossible for me to get any effect from kratom

So 5 hours after my last 2 liquid shots i broke off a small piece of naltrexone--maybe 4-5 mgs and took it.  Waited.  Kept waiting.  2 hours later i had felt nothing.  Maybe a little hot skin feeling.  so i took another 4-5mgs.  Waited.  Waited.  Still Nothing.  Took yet another 4-5 mgs an hour later.  waited.  Nothing.  NOTHING.  The rest of that day I kept doing the same thing until i had the full 50mg pill in my body.  Nothing.  Nothing but a clear head, feeling alive, slept just fine, hopeful, and holy cow I have now gone 2 full days without any K.  No watery eyes, no sneezing, zero anything.   May not seem like a long time, for this guys who rarely could go 12 hours its a big deal.   And I have absolutely zero desire for Kratom right now.

Not sure how it is possible I didn't get sick, parcipitate withdrawl.  My olny explanation is titrating with smaller doses.  But have read where even 5 mgs has parcipitated withdrawls for some.  So I am baffled, consider myself so lucky.  Maybe it is still coming???  who knows.

NOw for the real work.  My therapist has been fully aware of my kratom struggles, my sponsor, etc., and am so excited to get to work with a clear mind and not be a slave to that shit anymore.

Officially past the 5 day mark and starting day 6.  I am definitely past the worst of the withdrawals, but still feel a little off.  I definitely still have some back pain and a headache most of the day, but advil seems to help.  I have been starting each day with some exercise which also makes the mornings that much better.  

This morning I made the mistake of thinking I felt better and drinking coffee which in hind sight was a bad idea.  My heart has been pounding and anxiety high all afternoon making it hard for me to do work.  

I am staying strong, but just want this to be over with already.  Can't wait to just feel normal again.  Tomorrow I have a personal trainer at 7 A.M. to start the day off strong hopefully that will help me feel better.

Back in February when I was only 3-4 months in and just starting heavy use I briefly stopped due to getting sick and in the ER for suspected pancreatitis. I gave into temptation on night 4 and end up getting more on day 6. Withdraw was already over at that point... Kratom helped to speed up a boring year but I am disappointed by how much I missed out on.  This is the last time I give into temptation. The last time I endure the acutes. 

Its hard to judge just how high my usage got. There is significant variability between strains. I hit a high of over 30gpd, and managed to use a good strain to taper down to 18.  The most recent batch was terrible and had me quickly giving up on my taper. This past month has been a blur of downing a heaping spoonful, going back to normal for an a hour or two, only to endure withdraw and need another spoon. I am done with that life. Its pathetic so I made the jump. 

I have a 3 day work week to go through and will see family on xmas (day 8)  Hope things are mostly normal by then. 

For those reading  dont give up hope. You can do it too. Day 3 was terrible. I sat in front of the tv the entire day. My legs twitching, anxiety high. Took my dog for a walk and felt a lot better. Wife noticed and thinks im sick. Hope to start putting on a stronger front. Ended up taking a 1.5g of phenibut. Took 5 hours to kick in but then put me right to sleep thankgod. This (legal) drug is far more dangerous than Kratom so I am only allowing myself 3 days of use. Day 5 will be a light dose to sleep and day 6 I will be on my own.  Day 4 is a lot better though... I am definitely out of sorts but so far not taking any helper meds besides L theanine... I think I am almost through the worst of it...

I’m down from 30g a day for 7 years. I’m sure to a big degreee the type of withdrawals are different on a case by case basis. I’m just wondering what I should expect as far as acute withdrawals jumping from this point or if going any lower and holding for a few days first will make much of a difference. Are the acutes usually worse during the tail end than the actual jump, or am I just psyching myself out?",3

I took roughly 2-3grams of penis envy (they were strong 😳). I had been taking kratom daily since March 2020 and multiple times weekly since 2018. After 6 months of daily use I was getting sick of spending money on it and getting sick of feeling a mild buzz for 30 minutes and then just becoming irritable. 

I took a dose of K the morning of my shroom trip, then took the mushrooms at about 6pm. I had a great trip with my girlfriend, a nice reset and very therapeutic. I told myself before the trip that I’m not going to take kratom tomorrow and see if I have any withdrawal effects. I’ve taken days off kratom before during regular use and they weren’t fun. Fatigue, body aches, headaches. The next day I had zero withdrawl effects. Day after that - still none. Day 3, none. Now at day 5 I’m convinced the mushrooms reset me. I’ve had no withdrawals or urge to take kratom. I highly recommend this technique for addiction/dependence as it worked with me to quit vaping as well. (LSD however, not mushies)

Psychedelics for the win again 🍄:)

I’m CT from 4-6Tbs a day, for roughly around a year. I made it 5 days last time. I know it’s funny, but I’m quitting due to anxiety: Job related anxiety. You see, I fucking HATE my current job, and live in an area where the economy is pretty bad, so good jobs are hard to come by. My best friend is has me a spot where he works, they’re supposed to call me on the first week of the year. Despite him and a slew of other people telling me that they don’t test for Kratom, I can’t help but think, “what if there’s that chance, even though I live in a legal state?” And I figured the only way to ease my mind was to CT, because around the first of the year will be 10 days clean, and I’ve only heard of one test that can detect past that.

Not gonna lie, caffeine pills have been helping more. They did nothing my first two days off the sludge--didn't take any yesterday, but I took one this morning and it works again. 

I'm a little mucus-y, but I think that's more to do with the cold weather as opposed to WD. As I stated in my previous post--I was forced to undergo the controversial method of cycling through strains before going CT because the café I buy from failed to get their shipment in, and honestly, this is the first time in months I get somewhat disgusted at the thought of drinking Kratom.

I'm not nearly as anxious as I was two days ago, and am excited to see my family over the Holidays. I'm a bit nervous about my job situation since my full-time contract is up on December 31st and I start Grad school on the 10th, but I'm also relieved, because I genuinely hated this job and truly feel my employment situation, the pandemic, and isolation really pushed this into a full-blown addiction. I didn't really even notice WD from Kratom until late Summer when my daily dosage increased exponentially due to my stress.

As far as other WD symptoms go, I haven't experienced any RLS or insomnia, I did have trouble staying asleep and getting up last week but I was still taking Kratom then. Funny enough, most of my WD symptoms occurred when I switched strains for the last time. 

I felt bored and lethargic yesterday, but felt inspired enough to help my mom gift a Christmas tree and some presents to a family in need yesterday who was ""skipping Christmas"" this year. Doing this really opened my eyes and I felt truly happy for the first time in awhile helping someone else.

For the first time in a very long time I woke up this morning and actually just laid in bed and looked out the window and thought about all the things I am grateful for and all the things I am excited about.  Normally I wake up and my body aches and there’s no resting in bed just shoving a spoonful of sludge in my mouth to start my day. 

One thing about my quit that I feel has really helped me has been the two weeks of cleansing that I have been doing to get this shit out of my system. It started with three hot baths a day and I mean real hot so I could sweat and cleanse my liver. Meanwhile drinking lots of water with lemon and Celtic sea salt, (healthy Gatorade)

Daily juicing of lemon, kale, celery , lots of cilantro as it is great for liver cleansing. And some ginger and chlorella.  This potent blend just flushes the liver and colon of major  toxicity. 
I’ve also done a few enemas to really flush toxins of of the colon. 

Most important has been a positive mindset and a group of supportive friends. I keep telling myself I am a warrior and I only think positive. If a negative thought comes in, that’s when you practice mindfulness and recognize it for what it is and let it go. We are only suffering mentally because we choose to. Focus on the present and all the things you are grateful for and let that be your mantra throughout the day. I am so grateful to be able to just let here in bed and look out the window in peace and comfort and write to all you strong warriors. With love and respect.",44

I feel ok. Just very flat. And that's fine. My WDs are minimal as expected having had experience of quitting kratom back in 2016 at 35/40 Gpd. That was ruff. I made it. I didn't think of kratom for 3 years.
I turned my life around.  Moved to Asia for 50 weeks a year.  Life was good.  Not 100% but a vast improvement. My mental health vastly improved. 

I've now been stuck in the UK for 9 1/2 months as I can't get back to my life in Asia.
It's absolute chaos here in the UK and I'm very angry that I am not able to get on with my life. 

My mental health is totally shot. I don't need a Doctor or medication. I just need my life back. It should be simple but my life is not in my own hands.

I don't feel this is the place for political discussion so I'll leave out the politics.
All I can do is live in hope that the situation improves. 

I need to regroup.  Keep my exercise going. Keep cooking good food.. Keep playing my Hindu mantras and keep the yoga on track. But my motivation is wavering as it usually does with or without kratom. Nothing outside the ordinary. 

I know I'm a lucky man and I thank the Gods everyday for what I have. I'm always greatful.
The tears are flowing now. Perhaps they will help. Better out than in as they say.

Where ever you are on your quit I pray for your success. Keep it going guys.

Much love freedombaba

I've been lurking on your community page here and I'm wicked pumped for all of you who have said goodbye to the dirt drink. I continue to be on a very heavy dose of Red Bali powder and plan to either taper or jump come New Years. I started in the late summer of 2018 (at a Dweezil Zappa show) and have been a daily user since. I was 3-4 months off of Suboxone and stupidly picked up the Kratom habit not quite realizing what could happen. I'm a recovering drunk and have been addicted to most drugs at one point or another in my 43 years. At the time I stumbled into using Kratom, I was on the verge of relapse. I could feel the demon waking up and Kratom actually put him back to sleep. Only temporarily though as I developed a daily habit and fell off the wagon anyway this past summer. Fortunately, I was able to kick the drink again (which gets harder and harder as I get older). I'm just over three months drug and alcohol free with exception to my 100-150 gpd Kratom habit. I just consume it anytime I start feeling down. It's really time to give it up. 

I just discovered reddit the past couple of days. It seems like a great way to talk to people going through the same ordeal. I'm truly blessed with a wonderful wife and children that I'm completely open with about my issues. That makes things a whole lot easier. But after experiencing w/d from suboxone, I'm truly dreading this endeavor. Out of all w/d I've experienced, that was the worst.

Just thought I'd introduce myself and thank you in advance for any info and/or support you might be so kind as to share with me as I get ready to free myself from this nonsense. You all are incredibly inspiring and I wish you all the best moving forward. Look forward to sharing my experience with you.",6

I’ve been taking Kratom since January 2018, so it’ll be 3 years really soon. I went through heroin detox, and while I was withdrawing I started taking Kratom to help. Once I started to feel better from the heroin, I kept taking the Kratom, stupidly. I honestly didn’t even feel like it was doing anything for me, but my addictive personality is insane. So a month or so goes by and I realize that every morning I feel dopesick, and I got really confused because I didn’t think it was from the Kratom, but it was. I’ve been taking the capsules just from the smoke shop since I started, occasionally trying the powder and some tea. I started with about 10 capsules (~5 grams) 2-3 times a day, and it has slowly progressed. After about a year I started tapering, and it seemed like it was really working for me. But I noticed that I would get sick quicker and more often. I started taking 7, then 6, and then 5 capsules about 5-6 times a day. I got down to taking 4 capsules a day, and figured I could just taper down until I could just get off of it. I’m currently at 3 capsules but I literally take 3 like 8 times a day, and my withdrawals have been just as bad as when I was taking 10 in the beginning. It literally feels like a heroin withdrawal every time. I thought tapering would help, but it feels like it doesn’t even matter the amount I taper to because it’s not making the detox symptoms any more mild. I have a friend that takes Kratom, and he said that he always just goes cold turkey because he can’t taper (he doesn’t have the willpower, so he’s never tried) but I’m just confused as to why taking such a small amount is still affecting me so bad. I’m so desperate to quit, I barely eat because the Kratom doesn’t work after I eat a meal and since I have to take it basically every 2-3 hours, I get scared to eat because I’m worried I’ll go through withdrawals. I feel so alone, I try to hide the fact that I take it but because of the frequency I need to take them everyone in my life (in-laws, parents, friends, work) knows that I take it and it’s embarrassing, especially when they question the reason that I take them and why I don’t just stop taking them. 
I’d love to hear some opinions, experiences, and advice. And even just support.

2020-12-20 20:17:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/kh6uv5/paws_on_the_taper/,PAWS on the Taper,"OK.  I know this is an oxymoron.  You cannot have **POST** acute withdrawal symptoms if #1 you are not 100% quit yet, and #2 you might not even *have* acutes because of your taper.

But as a taper-er I have the same chemical imbalances that a CT quitter would.  I am just spreading out my misery over a longer period of time, and making a softer landing for myself. That's the theory anyway.

But my neuro chemistry has to be restored from the same depths as the CT quitter.  The difference is my healing starts during the reduced use of the offending substance instead of strictly after cessation.

So this crushing anhedonia, and deep depression I am experiencing now, about 2.5 months into my taper is, in my humble opinion, the taper-ers version of PAWS.

At least for me, I have no doubt that this is at possibly a taste of what the CT quitter might feel 30-70 days in depending on their history.  I suppose I may have the benefit of lessening the severity of this effect because of the taper. But I have not eliminated the need for my brain to go through the same restoration process.  I've just changed the playing field a little.  It makes sense that PAWS too could be spread out over the taper, and 2.5 months in at \~90% reduction it seems natural that I am having this experience.

Props to you cold turkey iron men and women.  I feel your pain.  Maybe a shallower, longer version of it... but I feel it.  And to my fellow taper-ers.  Maybe you will not have my experience?  But if you do, just know...  you can handle it even though it sucks.",3

Just need to get a few things out to someone and think this is the right place. Sorry for the rambling, there are just so many things going through my head. There are a few questions at the very end, you can skip to that part if you like.

First of all: I have a great life, I am very happy with where I am overall, have a social net and a great family. I know this is not even comparable to what some other people posting here are going through. I had some very, very dark years myself (severe depressive anxiety disorder from age 8 to 16 for those interested) and know for a fact that I am complaining on a very high level. **If you plan on only reading a few posts maybe pick another one**. I believe that other people might need your help a lot more than I do. I am really just rambling here to get a few thoughts out of my head but I would of course appreciate a few responses if you have the time. Again, please leave this post now and look at the other recent ones if you haven't, I can live without too many responses (one or two responses would be great tho :D).

**Ramble**

I am 19 and started using Kratom roughly 1 1/2 years ago. It just took the edge of some days and made life easier. I pretty much immediatly started using kratom daily after the first consumption and stopped exactly one year ago for two weeks. These two weeks were pretty fine actually (which isn't too surprising after only using it for 6 months). I felt minor symptoms like headache, mood swings, problems sleeping and just generally unwell.

For the entire duration of my kratom consumption I used exactly 6 grams a day (first white sumatra then mountain king). The 6 grams never meaningfully changed the effectiveness. When taking it today it feels almost exactly like on the first day which is pretty weird. Is that common at these medium doses?

I was always aware that I am addicted but I knew I could stop at any time (I know, everyone is saying that to themselfs). Anyways I bought my last dose 40 days ago (250g) and there is only 1 dose remaining, which I will keep. I don't want to quit because I don't have any kratom left, I want to quit because I want to quit. If I take the last dose at any point in the next two weeks I will consult a doctor. I felt very much in control of my kratom addiction at every point in the last 1 1/2 years and me taking the last dose would certainly prove otherwise (in which case I am way more addicted than I think I am).

&#x200B;

I stopped using kratom 60 hours ago and the symptoms really started 12 hours ago (when waking up this morning). Throughout the day my physical symptoms got worse. Right now I feel pretty nauseous (it is getting worse and worse every minute), have mild headaches, am shaking a bit, sweating a lot and just feel overly energetic while feeling exhausted at the same time.

Mentally I am doing pretty well actually. I am aware of my symptoms but they just feel pretty surreal. If you have meditated into a certain state of mind you can probably relate to this feeling. I am aware of the existance of these feelings but they are just not bothering me in the slightest. They feel very distant, somewhat artificial, not like ""real"" feelings. Can anyone of you relate? I know that sounds pretty weird :D

**Next Level Ramble**

Even more rambling incoming. Feel free to ignore xD. Just don't have anyone to talk to rn, COVID and stuff.

I want to stop because my productiveness has plummeted. I dropped out of school 3 years ago and worked as a software engineer for a year. I was well respected and learned quickly. My productive output was insane in that time. I easily outperformed the senior developers in that team by a significant amount - until I started using kratom.

I got lazy and just didn't put in the required amount of work. After some time I actually couldn't put in the work anymore, even when I wanted. I couldn't focus and did more enjoyable things without actually wanting to (standard procrastination I guess but something I never personally had a problem with before).

This wasn't a huge problem at the time. Once you have a certain reputation and proven competency a few times people stop questioning. It was relatively easy to mask (and I earned 3€ an hour while the company was paid 85€ an hour for my work by the customer so.... I didn't feel particularly bad for doing that either).

&#x200B;

In April I switched jobs and I was so bad at it I couldn't believe it. I just couldn't keep up with other developers and since I had lost a big part of my motivation to really dive into a topic because of kratom (I think) it took me months to get into the project and even then I greatly underperformed. This is when I decided to quit but my studies had already started. A job + studying full time is enough stress, I really didn't need a kratom withdrawl on top.

&#x200B;

Three days ago my studies ended and so I stopped taking kratom. I started feeling the benefits of quitting today already. I started working on a music visualizer just for fun and I had more fun coding than in over a year. It felt like two years ago when I would pick a topic and totally lose myself in it, not thinking about anything else, not procrastinating, just working on that topic for the sake of it. It is honestly like a drug or meditation after a few hours, it feels amazing.

&#x200B;

One note (just so I can go back to this and laugh about my stupidity if it turns out to be false): I don't think I am particularly psychologically dependent (honestly I don't feel like I am psychologically dependent at all). I never felt the need to take kratom in the entire time I was taking it. Taking kratom was always a decision for me and even now when my physical symptoms feel pretty bad I do not crave at all. I have a huge family of 22 aunts and uncles (+ their husbands/wifes, I know, my grandparents are rabbits), not a single one of which has any addiction. Many of them used to smoke back when it was cool but every single one of them except for one uncle managed to quit on the first try so I guess I am lucky in that part of the genetics department (we have a few other inherent flaws in our DNA I would happily trade if anyone is interested).

&#x200B;

**Questions**

Well that will probably be my last good day for now, the symptoms got noticably worse while writing this post (got a tinnitus, my nausea is getting pretty uncomfortable and I started to experience light hypersensitivity while writing this post - my eyes feel like rocks). How long is a withdrawl after 1 1/2 years of consumption? I hope I will fell somewhat well again on the 24th (so 6 days after quitting). Is there certain behavior that can make the symptoms significantly worse?

I took 300mg 5htp in the morning. Does anyone of you have experience with that? Has it significantly helped you through the withdrawl? I've read that it helps with opiate withdrawls in general so I thought I'd give it a try. I found some general ""it helps"" information on it but would appreciate if someone could give me his/her experience on it. What was your dosage like and it what phases has it helped you the most? How and when have you taken it?

How long will the more general symptoms last for? I hope to be fully there again in 1 month.

&#x200B;

**Short Ramble**

Anyways I start to lose track of what I am actually writing here. My head starts to bang and I am shaking so much I can barely hit the keys (something I am not to unfimiliar with tho, withdrawl is just greatly strengthening this behavior). I should probably go to bed into a stare contest with the roof. Thank you for taking the time and reading this :)",2
2020-12-20 15:26:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/kh1lo6/day_11_ct/,Day 11 CT,"First time posting here. So I took the plunge 11 days ago. This is my 4th time quitting, however this is the first time I am stopping with the goal of never touching kratom again. I first dabbled in the dark arts of kratom while in college 4 years ago. It was something I would do with some buddies every once in a while, but was something I never imagined I would take every day. I would buy small 15g baggie and do small doses at night when i wasn't smoking weed or drinking on the weekends. Flash forward 2 years, I graduated college and moved back home with my parents before applying to graduate school. This is where I fell into a dark hole. I started using every night. I believe the cause of this problem was adjusting to postgrad life. I wasn't on my own, constantly with friends, or having really anything to do. A couple of things didn't go my way and instead of dealing with the dark thoughts, I turned to large doses of kratom. This was about a year ago. I would say nightly I was taking upwards of 50g. This in turn would lead to me staying up until 4am most nights, sleeping in till the noon the next day, and flat turning into a bum. One of the larger issues I had was turning to kratom to get through a shift at work (I work for a local urgent care). It started as something I would do when closing the clinic at night, and before i knew it i was stirring every 3 hours all day on the job. 

My first ""quit"" if you can call it that was when I was going to Italy with my family for a week. Kratom is a banned substance there, and i even considered buying caps and trying to smuggle them through the airline. I realized how incredible dumb this was and two days before the trip stopped kratom. To get through the withdrawals that first time i drank. The nights before the trip i would get drunk and fall asleep. After these 2 days i was relatively ok. I went on the trip and the only withdrawal i had was missing kratom. However, i fully planned on starting again when i got back to the states. Sure enough the first night i was home i dove back into my kratom addiction. 

These next few months would really be the darkest points of my addiction. I had a good friend who also ended up becoming a kratom addict. We would play video games every night almost egg each other on to do more and more kratom. At this point i was stirring every day within 4 hours of waking up, and not stopping until 3 or 4 in the morning. Around March of this year my fellow kratom addict friend and i decided to start tapering. Ended up dropping from over 50g a day to around 10g a day. In June of this year we decided to quit. Instead of drinking my way through the withdrawals, i smoked instead. After about 4 days i got through the acute withdrawals and was very happy with myself. Even this time i still planned on doing kratom in the future. I told myself it was something i could do on occasion for fun. Around day 9 of this cut, i decided to do a small stir of about 5g, telling myself i would only do it once a week. Well once a week turned into twice a week, and before i knew it was once again addicted to kratom. 

In November of this year i was scheduled for surgery. I knew i needed to stop taking kratom before going into the procedure for fear of any complications or interactions. A week before my surgery i made the plunge. This time i realized drinking or smoking wasn't the correct way to get through. My friend told me about Kava extract caps. Sure enough they are a god send for getting through acute withdrawals. Whenever i felt a wave of withdrawals coming i would simply take 2 kava extract caps. Additionally i had a prescription for trazadone to help with sleep. I made it 14 days before turning back to kratom. I was prescribed oxycodone for recovery and was terrified of my addictive personality. Instead i started using kratom daily again. Luckily i never went above 15g a day. 

11 days ago realized i needed to get off this green sludge. A friend showed me this community and ever since I've been on every day reading fellow posts. In early December i was diagnosed with crohns disease and here shortly I'll be starting remicaid (immunosuppressant). I realized i couldn't continue to use kratom and hope to find success in my treatment. 11 days ago I stopped using kratom. The first week i took kava and gabapentin to get through the acutes. What I've realized is that's the easy part. When PAWS kick in and crippling depression follows it's hell. I've found some success in kava root. It fills the void that kicks in around 6pm every day. It's something to look forward to and find some solace in the difficulty of the nighttime blues. I dumped the rest of my kratom down the toilet 3 days ago and really feel this is the time i get back to who i once was before kratom took over my life. 

Sorry for such the long post. I just wanted to put down in writing the journey I've been on since i was first introduced to the green demon 4 years ago. Good luck to all those lurkers that i was before this post who read every day but are unsure or afraid to finally fight back against kratom. It feels amazing to finally be taking a positive step forward in my life and i urge everyone seriously thinking of quitting to make the jump.",13
2020-12-20 14:55:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/kh0z8p/day_4/,Day 4,"Hi All,

Made it to 96 hours and extremely proud of myself.  Day 3 was probably the hardest so far emotionally I just felt really down and all over the place. I spoke to my significant other and we went for an hour drive to a park and went for like a 25 minute walk in the snow.  Just the act of driving and walking made me feel so much better for the rest of the night.

Overall Today (day 4) I am starting to feel better.  If yesterday I was at 50% today I am at 53%.  Its not much, but I can certainly feel that I am moving in the right direction.  Today we did a similar thing and started the morning with a two hour drive to some random location. Just getting out and keeping busy is so important its really helped me get through these last few days.  

I have been using Xanax at night to sleep, but none during the day as I don't want to completely numb myself during the process.  Going to use Xanax as a sleep aid through day 6 and try to sleep on my own day 7. Ive been using less then 1mg each day probably closer to .5 mg as I dont need a lot.  

I can only speak for myself as everyones experience is different. So far the withdrawals have definitely sucked, but not nearly as bad as I expected.  I read a lot of stories on here about how bad things were which scared me a bit.  I only used heavy for about 5-6 months which may be why my withdrawals have been a bit more manageable.  If you are under 6 months of use and reading this it might not be so bad.  

Strangely enough I have had very little temptation to use over the last 4 days.  Maybe thats because the xanax is calming those feelings into the next day or maybe because im just so sick of being reliant on a substance. 

Thanks for reading I look forward to these daily posts as its another notch in my belt.

We can do it!

Edit: to add at the end last 2-3 months I was over 40GPD easily probably closer to 60.",3

I relapsed last Thursday after the girl I've been with the last couple months insinuated that she may be pregnant. It all happened so fast, but honestly I should've seen this coming. I've called out of work for the last 3 days, to avoid seeing her and to continue my binge in solitude.

I know this isn't sustainable and I know I need to quit again as soon as possible to avoid sliding any further. I've only told one friend that I relapsed but I'm not sure how helpful that was considering he drove with me to buy more kratom. I already lied to my mom when she asked me if I was using again. With Christmas right around the corner I'm not too sure if I want to ruin the holidays again- but I'm sure this is just an excuse.

I'm lacking more motivation by the day to get back on the wagon and pick myself back up. I feel like I'm right back at square one, which technically I am. For those of you who've relapsed after a decent amount of time sober, what did you do to get back on track? My brain is desperately trying to justify using again, but I just know I can't. I'm just lost right now and not sure where to turn- I never established much of a support group other than this sub. Thank you all for getting me to this point.

The reason I quit was actually because I was turning in to a different person, but then as soon as I quit my hair stopped falling out and started rapidly growing back. Which made me realize the past 2 years of kratom addiction were what was causing my entire head to look like I'd been exposed to radiation or something. Just thin all over, it was very weird. But if I take kratom even once, and even like 3 grams, my hair starts shedding a ton the days after. Which is psychologically kind of traumatizing. Somehow, this addiction is so strong that even knowing what was going to happen, I took some at the end of November for 2 days and what do you know, all of my hair started falling out again. So I shaved it all of, which is a horrible horrible look for me, and I think after that long goodbye. I'm finally just sick of this shit, fortunately the last time I took it was awful and I felt nauseous and threw up so I hope that the addict in my brain can just associate kratom with that instead.

&#x200B;

As someone who suffers from sometimes severe depression, sometimes Kratom was my emergency brake when I was feeling suicidal. And my addict brain would go ""Well I'd rather take the kratom than kill myself"", which is of course true, but it's a weak state of mind and the addict brain will just feed into it. I hate this shit and I hate how it overwhelmed my addict brain like nothing else in my life ever has",9

I’ve been reading a lot on this forum for the last 2 weeks and it’s helped me tremendously.  All of you guys are brave and strong for what you’re doing no matter the progress.  I just wanna share a my experience quitting ct and what’s kinda helped me through.  

So I was taking about 15-25 gpd for about 3-4 months straight.  I lost myself and dug myself in the deepest, darkest pit I’ve ever been in.  I wasn’t talking to anyone not even my family, lost interest in the hobbies I use to love (hanging with friends, gaming, going outdoors taking a jog or going fishing was a big one for me that’s helped me for years, drawing and sketching, and much much more) and I didn’t even notice it’s like it crept up and stole everything from me.  Idk what hit me but one day it was a giant wave of reality check of what was actually happening..  I had to quit.  It wasn’t an option anymore k was taking away every aspect of my life slowly without me know and I was becoming depressed, doubting myself, beating myself up 24/7, lost about 15 pounds from not eating because I didn’t want it to effect my k high.  I knew I needed to be better.  I knew I needed to start becoming my true self and grind harder than ever.  
 
The WD were somewhat moderate in my case.  The first 3 days definitely were the worst.  I was an emotional mess along with feeling like I had a slight cold (body aches, stuffy nose, watery eyes, lack of appetite)  surprisingly I’ve had no diarrhea or stomach aches.  I took a lot of ibuprofen to help with the physical symptoms which helped for the most part.  Being emotional wreck is what really got me the most and took some of my prescribed klonopin when I couldn’t take the anxiety anymore I only took as needed.  But honestly sitting there crying my eyes out realizing all the things I needed to change actually made me feel happy in way if that make sense?  I haven’t felt anything in so long and I finally felt my feelings, I embraced it and just let it run its course, I had a whole paradigm shift happen.  I knew I needed to start working on my mental healthy and becoming my best version of me.  I knew I shouldn’t put myself down and to help I’ve read a lot of your guys stories and man they’ve helped me not beat myself up.  I also start exercising every morning when I got up for at least 10-15 mins up to about 25-30 mins a day now and it’s help me out so much it’s unbelievable, along with some really good cannabis. Also started to take somewhat cool showers to help with the aches.  Watching motivation speech videos on YouTube every morning when I wake up.  started to keep myself busy.  All around just started to look at the positives in life and not the negatives. 

About day 4-5 most of the physical symptoms were gone but would come and go for the next few days it’s mostly in my head at this point.  But I realized I started to actually listen to music again and feel the lyrics in my soul and would just cry because I missed that feeling music gives you , the way the lyrics speak to you.  I went out and got a fresh ass haircut which was needed for months just hadn’t had the motivation to go out an do it because I was so anti social on I.   I had no appetite which kinda sucked but I was forcing water and fruit down every couple hours and would eat at least 1 hot meal acouple hours before laying down. I started to get a little bit more sleep but not much more than 5 hours or so but the exercise helps tire me out along with some prescribed ambien when needed so insomnia wasn’t much of a problem.  Just fatigued.

Day 7-Now.  I’m meditating after every workout while listening to binaural beats and that helps me with anything.  I still get little spurts of craving for it but I know I’m stronger than that.  I’m bettering myself .  And I’m starting to feel more and more like my self each day.  It’s a struggle.  It’s hard.  There’s times I wanna give up and give in but I know that’s not gonna do any good for me and it’s not an option I’m already so far and this is and uphill battle I’m going to win.  I’m gonna continue on my journey to k free life because I’m not gonna let that takeaway the joys and beauty in life and what really blew me away is I’ve never had a problem abusing or taking to much of anything let alone addiction so I’m taking it step by step, second by second.  You guys on this forum are amazing people and you’ve helped me the last acouple weeks to push myself to be better.  And to anyone struggling right now just keep that head up and push forward, don’t give up and don’t give in.  You’re a beautiful soul and need to treat yourself as such.  Bless all of you and wish you all nothing but positive vibes and blessing.  Thanks for reading my experience so far.  Will try to keep up my progression.",21

My anxiety and depression is ok. I literally have to stop working for a while due to this withdrawal. I start feeling right after 90 days, then i can say i feel much much better. 

The ride was hell for me in the first 2 months. Stop hanging out. The temptation is hard here. Like i woke up and hoping to feel okay but the anxiety and depression start to hit right after i woke up. And i just not again, today?. My appetite lost, eat once daily, sometimes only instant noodle. I dont get much supplement during withdrawal accept during acute i take some magnesium, i try tyrosene during PAWS but it make my pounding heart worse. Last week i got my bloodwork. Everything is ok normal accept my cholesterol. I listened a lot of ska & trance music, (Our Destiny - Hamzeh is most repeated song on my spotify) because i think it helps me during withdrawal, i cant listened to sad music, it makes me super depressing.

For all of you guys that are still struggling and feel that they will not heal trust me, it will, i feel that way too. I feel like i make a permanent damage and just accepting. 

I would like to thank some of the people here i dont really remember all their names, the one that i chat, group zoom meeting, the one that gives me motivation. Thank you so much! This experience really humbled me down to earth. Love u guys.

2020-12-20 00:31:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/kgofyg/finally/,Finally,"Hey guys, i never contributed to this group. Just used it periodically. I was a 6 rounded tablespoons a day person at the most. Then tapered down to just the tiniest amount. Then eventually nothing. Then started taking again. Then quit for good. It’s probably been a good 6 months since i’ve had kratom. I just want to say that seemingly bizarre/intense withdrawals do go away. To this day, i have 0 intentions of taking kratom again, and do not feel any desire to do so. 

To ease my transition, I HAD to go work out heavy or else i was going to not be able to sleep (for the 1st couple weeks). I upped my general coffee usage during the day, and would periodically take Advil. 

Switching from a BS diet to a plant based one heavily influenced my ability to recoup faster. I added 5HTP to vitamins as well, as a friend had recommended it. 

My best advice is, if you have addict tendencies, replace kratom with healthy addictions, like exercise and nutrition. And get ready to add that shit in right away. Don’t wait on it.

I’m sure this post is like many you’ve already read already. I likely won’t be checking back too often to make sure it went through. I’m not much of a person that gives too many shits about virtual rule following on online forums.  I haven’t ever posted on reddit, but i downloaded the app for inspiration from this group. 

I just want you to know that i was taking copious amounts of the shit and got through it.

Water, Vegetable heavy diet, and exercise, as well as support from a couple close people are what helped the most. 

You can do it! I relapsed into it once before i quit for good, so even if you fail, keep trying. It was worth it!",8

I'm still dealing with sporadic bouts of nausea and anhedona/lack of energy.  I have been working out again for 2 weeks solid, and my appreciacion for life couldn't be higher.  

Just ""tired of being tired"" lol.  Caffeine doesn't work anymore and sugar helps but just a little.  Started taking panax ginseng and got back on THC.  I also use CBD flower.  Nicotine, caffeine and sugar are next to go.  My diet needs lots of work, but I'm just burnt out.  

I start a new job on Monday delivering for a local specialty pharmacy.  I'm super happy but I don't want to feel lethargic on the job.  

My relationship with kratom is terminated.  I have no desire to touch it again.  Have had many opportunities to do so but I'm just over it.  Makes me sick.",5

First post here so I just want to say I SEE you, and I am so proud of everyone here. I started using kratom earlier this year because a co-worker was getting me into pot, and covid stress was getting to me. I know I have an addictive personality, and alcoholism runs in the family, so I struggled with the reality that weed was not going to be a good coping mechanism. Around the same time my partner had some extra pain pills lying around. Alas, the pills ran out and I was looking for that euphoric feeling. Then I found kratom. I wish the store clerk's would've warned me at least a little bit...

This year felt like one big block of time, hidden in the back of my mind like an empty, emotionless space. I was using about 12-20 GPD. A med specialist I go to recommended that I get off the kratom. Nothing other than that. I thought, ""Psh, what does she know, this green dust has helped a lot of people and it make me feel good!"" I suffer from moderate anxiety and depression, and I was just frustrated with my perscribed meds not working. I started realizing I can't adjust my meds and tell notice any changes when I'm partially high and having mood swings all the time. Eventually I left my job. I got to the point of being so irritible, I didn't know who I was anymore. I knew I needed to be in a different environment if I was going to quit. 

I decided to make the jump during winter break from college. Little stressors and all the time I need to get clean. I now have a new job working at a restaurant helping out the other employees. No dealing with ""Karen's"" and wrecking my mood. My co-workers are all wonderful. I had just finished a tough semester, getting better grades than last semester as I was on academic warning and had to push myself harder. I had all these good things happening to me, but not feeling them...

The past month, I was on 2g 3x a day down to 1g 2x a day this week. I decided to make the jump, and get a haircut. I normally leave my hair grow out longer so that when I DO get a haircut, I feel like a new person. I used that momentum to carry me through the day. This was the first time I haven't dosed before work just to get through. Literally every co-worker complimented me on my haircut. They gassed me up! Unknown to them, even though I wanted to share my struggle, I was trying to focus on making it through the night. 

Today and yesterday have been a lot of reminiscing about the past me, and the memories I have made. I'm trying not to dwelll on certain things, rather focusing on the good memories and taking their joy, using that as strength to fuel my passion for possible new memories. I am sore, and trying to keep myself occupied. I haven't been out since the start of covid, and my partner's niece invited us over for a small Christmas party. This was the first time since March I've been somewhat excited about something. Being around people is good for me, even though I have social anxiety. 

Sorry if I rambled on, just letting some stuff out. This is exactly where I should be in this moment. I will continue on. Thank you for reading, I wish you all the best on your journey! 

TL;DR: Was using kratom for under a year. Using about 12-20 GPD, tapered down to 2-3 GPD. Two days clean now. Using magnesium, fish oil, zinc, multivitamin, CBD & CBG oil, rhodiola rosea, and aspirin. Tried black seed oil and saffron, just made my head hurt more.",3

2020-12-19 17:08:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/kgheh4/day_3/,Day 3,"72 hours in and it actually hasn’t been as bad as I thought it would be.  I’ve been able to keep down every meal which I think has allowed me to keep my energy up.  I did take .75 of Xanax day 1 and .25 of Xanax day 2 to go to sleep.  I think I will continue taking a small dose of .25 just to help me sleep.  I believe getting a full nights sleep is what’s making this withdrawal that much easier.  I know how miserable I’ve been in the past physically feeling like shit and not sleeping for a week.  I have to say sleeping 6-8 hours the first 2 nights has helped immensely.  

I have been trying to be as active as possible. Yesterday I put in 12,000 steps and today I started with a 3.5 mile run on the treadmill.  Overall the first 3 days have been tough but not nearly as tough as I expected. I was using heavy for about 6 months so I don’t have nearly the usage of some of the other people posting which may be why my experience is bad, but not unbearable.  

Today might have been the toughest day mentally.  I think by 72 hours for the most part the kratom is out of my system. I did feel the mental part really take over today at times just feeling full of anxiety and depressed and overall emotional.  Did a bit more crying today then normal, but it felt good at the time.  

Unfortunately I have very little motivation to do anything. Even simple things I wanted to get done today I just couldn’t do. For some reason sitting at my desk on my computer is just not good for me emotionally. So I’ve just been trying to go for walks / drives as often.  I’ve been looking forward to these daily updates as for me at this time each 24 hours is a big win. So thanks for reading and the advice.

We can do it",4

I’ve been lurking on this sub for years and have wanted to quit so badly so many times, but I wasn’t ready. Apparently I needed more convincing that a legal substance like Kratom was powerful enough to strip away everything I loved about myself until nothing but a shell is left. My wife is 100% on point when she told me “you’re raw.” I’ve let this substance wear me down to a 129 lb nub of a person. I’ve been eating one meal a day for awhile now and I don’t know when is the last time I got a real night’s sleep. I’m just too tired to continue the charade. I quit drinking alcohol 5 years ago and kratom helped me tame that beast in a way that I’m not sure I could have done on my own, but now it has turned me into someone who can’t even look in the mirror anymore without feeling profoundly shameful. Well now I can hold my head a little higher knowing I’m no longer beholden to the green mistress.",30
2020-12-19 15:56:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/kgg4uo/stick_with_it/,Stick with it.,"Throughout the quitting process as time goes on, there will be a voice in your head that tries to convince you that life wasn't so bad on the sludge. Our brains tend to do that when recalling past experiences. For me, I remember the lack of social anxiety. However, when I really think about it, it was just pure unadulterated apathy that was a byproduct of my life falling apart all around me. I didn't care about my own opinion of myself so why should I care about others? Not a good way to live. What I realize now, is that being sober for a long amount of time teaches you how to face yourself as yourself. It's ruthless at first but leads to a deep contentment with who you really are. You come out so much stronger than you ever thought possible. For some, it may take a little longer depending on length/amount used, and other factors that led to the reason. Regardless, it's always worth it in the end and you will find yourself again.

Here I am on day 49 of the taper and I haven't had Kratom for 2 days. It wasn't by choice though, the café I buy from was unable to get their shipment in and they probably won't have it in until January. This isn't the first time I've gone a few days without it during my taper (I went 4 days without a dose during Thanksgiving), but it's the 1st time I'm literally unable to get any, and honestly I feel somewhat relieved. 

Now, I could always go to the local head shop and buy some but idk, I have no desire to. I might also add that I've been forced to switch up strains a few times since Thanksgiving since the café I buy from ran out of my usual go-to (Yellow), which might be the reason my withdrawal isn't THAT BAD so far--some trouble sleeping last night, rise in body temp, brain fog, and lethargy, but that's really it.

I really hope I'm able to stick with it. Right now I'm worried about my ability to remain creative without Kratom because I made A LOT of music on it this year and I feel so uninspired without it...I'm also worried because I start graduate school in January and Kratom helped a lot in my undergrad when my anxiety was through the roof.

I know every body is different and some people can’t get it and you also can get addicted to GABA but honestly folks this is the only way to go for me.

I’m off work until January 4 so having to be productive is not an issue. My in laws are here for 4 days so I don’t have much parenting responsibility. I have gabapentin, clonidine, and ropinirole. I need to do this now. If I can’t do this now then I’m scared I will never do it and that is not an option. We are trying for a second child and my cycles are all messed up, my skin is awful, and I just feel so dull. When I don’t dose for a while and actually get emotions back it’s amazing. I laugh like I used to and just FEEL like I haven’t since I started Kratom 1.5 years ago. My fitness will improve. I’ve been exercising regularly and not seeing much improvement since I’m always so bloated from the capsules. I graduate with my doctorate in May then will face boards. Not to mention my career will involve making decisions about peoples medical care and I need to be on my game, not muddled from Kratom. I will do this. 

I am enough. I always feel like I need Kratom or other substances to make me “more”....but I don’t. I am a wife, mom, nurse, daughter, sister, soon-to-be-aunt, and friend. All the Kratom is making me is an addict.

Overall I felt/ feel pretty good. I felt clearheaded for the first time in a month or so. My emotions are definitely coming back and I’m able to return to different perceptions I had that were suppressed throughout my use. I’m starting to remember things that interest me and why they interest me. I’m starting to enjoy interactions I have with people again.   It was really helpful having work from 8-5. Instead of being a hypochondriac at home, I was forced to be productive and social today which was huge. I’ve noticed that at night I start to get a little more anxious, but I’ve been powering through it. I’m just grateful that I’m not experiencing dysphoria. ( I experienced extreme dysphoria was having mild oxy withdrawal in September and it was soul crushing). My body is feeling pretty much normal at this point. I had moments when my body’s temperature fluctuated, but it never got to the point of shivering chills or sweating. 

Throughout the day I noticed the voice in the back of my head trying to justify why it would be fine if I had just one more dose tonight before quitting for good. Every time I thought about using I remembered how emotionally suppressed I was for that month and half and how I was robbed of my personality. My relationships suffered and I lost my spark for a while. That,  in addition to noticing my hair getting thinner and brittle, was a dealbreaker for me. This line of thought helps me avoid relapsing. Every night I just think about how much better I’ll feel tomorrow.

One additional thought: I’m absolutely not feeling 100% however in comparison to how I was feeling on the sludge I feel pretty damn good. I feel awake, human again. I don’t feel like my life is passing me by. It feels really good to be present and not a zombie consumed by plant matter. :)",4

I started to taper for about 10 days but I finally decided to jump completely off w/a final small dose last Saturday.

I am about to finish Day 6 of taking almost nothing - only some mega doses of Vitamin C, 1 Niacin pill per day, and a Sam-E pill per day.

Right now I feel better than I did when I was tapering. Like I said, I think I tapered too fast and had flu and cold like symptoms pretty bad.

Monday-Tuesday (Day 2 and 3) were actually really good. But here we are now about to start Day 7 and I am SOOOOOOOOO ""MEH.""

My sleep has been decent believe it or not, but I don't have much energy or motivation.

My appetite - meh.

My mood - very meh.

I go through anxious moments during the day, usually because of and during work. I hate work.

It's funny because I thought  I might already be home free on Monday and Tuesday but then.....the rest of the week came.

I don't think it helps that because half of my family is scared to catch the COVID and Die, we are basically doing NOTHING for the holidays. Shit, life is so fucking boring right now. I picked the wrong time to quit this stuff!

Any other advice?

Too much melatonin, tried to drink some to cope (made things much worse), wallowed in pain. Today I got up after a few hours of sleep at around 4am and said maybe I have the energy to get on the stationary bike. I did a twenty minute workout and afterwards my brain let me sleep for another two hours. I just had a big lunch and my body all of the sudden seemed to want to exercise again. I ran a mile, after having been injured from distance running on k (I assume I couldn’t feel the injury early on and the green asshole made it much worse by the time I could feel it). The point of this post being that my body seems to have associated exercise with pleasure again and thank you all for making me feel less alienated and shameful for a problem that I thought was unique to myself.

2020-12-18 15:29:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/kfszd6/day_2/,Day 2,"Officially 48 hours in actually probably a little bit closer to 50.  I pushed myself a little bit today went for two walks that were about 30 minutes each.  Overall I just feel weird, but not nearly as bad as I expected. I withdrew from H / Fentanyl in 2014 and this experience is like 1/10th as bad. 

I have to say keeping busy is extremely helpful because as soon as I sit still I start to focus on how I dont feel well. So been just doing stuff at least every other hours even if its just driving around for 15 minutes and blasting the music. 

Last night was rough a lot of tossing and turning.  I ended up taking .5 mg of xanax which put me out for about 7 hours which I imagine is also why I dont feel horrible today.  I was planning on taking .25 of xanax during the days to help, but I really dont need it. So gonna save it for the nights.  I get this constant dry heaving which sucks, but been able to keep the food down so far.  Lower back pain and leg pain as well.  Overall the annoyance during the day is probably a 3/10 and at night a 5/10.  Surprisingly as I write this I feel hungry which is something I really didn't expect to feel so soon. 

To Add to the symptoms: 

* Really strong smells especially body odor 
* Cold Sweats at night 
* Lack of energy in general 
* sneezing 

For reference I have been using Kratom for about 6 months with the last 3 months being 30-50 GPD.  At this point I think for the most part the withdrawal's will be mild unless they just havent hit yet.  I think by tomorrow 72 hours I will know for sure.  From what I read 72 hours is typically the peak for acute and its uphill from there.

Seemed like a few people were curious about how rehab handles this addiction so I want to give everyone an update. Keep in mind this is my experience with this particular rehab center and I imagine its different depending on where you go. 

First things first. They were aware of what Kratom is and what long term abuse looks like. They treated me the same as an opiate user, however suboxone was out of the question. I came in a 70-80 gpd user and they wouldn't even consider giving me any. At the time I was frustrated but now I'm happy they made that decision for me. 

Detoxing there was the best decision I've ever made. So much easier than trying to do it myself. If you have the means I highly suggest doing a medical detox if you can't do it on your own. Nothing wrong with asking for help. That's not to say it still wasn't hell. They gave me a routine (every 8 hours) cocktail of ""comfort"" meds which included clonidine, vistaril, 50mg of seroquel and a multivitamin during the day, and clonidine, vistaril and 150mg of seroquel at night to try and help me sleep. The meds helped a little bit with the physical symptoms, but it was the mental symptoms and lack of sleep that was the real struggle for me. I pretty much just walked the halls of the facility for the first three nights, intermittently tried to lay down for a bit until my legs and arms couldn't take sitting still any longer. The depression and cravings were insane during that time as well. 

Day 5 I turned a corner. Most of the physical symptoms were completely gone and the depression had smoothed out a bit. I started going to classes that day even thought I was still technically in detox. The classes helped me pass the time and getting support from some of the other patients helped a lot. 

Day 7 I started to sleep better. Still tossed and turned but I was getting a few hours at least. 

Day 17ish - today. PAWS has started to rear its ugly head. I feel foggy and depressed and I hardly get pleasure from things. Ive been exercising and started going to meetings the day I got out but it's a struggle, man. I'm still battling though. I've accepted that things are going to be rough for a while and the only cure is time. Anyways that's my foggy brained spiel.",24

Last Tuesday (10 days ago) I decided it was time. I knew I couldn’t CT and I knew I could commit to a long taper, so that left me with 1 option- rapid taper. Right away cut down from 60g to 20g and every day lowered the amount until today, Friday, where I will only take 2 grams: 1 in the am, 1 in the pm. 

Everything was fine until I hit 6 grams (3 days ago). That’s when it all caught up to me. If I was a stronger person I’d hold on and stabilize there for a bit, but I knew it would just lead to me breaking the taper. So here we are. 

Overall I just feel like mild flu symptoms. The anxiety, stomach cramps, and overall tiredness are what’s effecting me the most. I’m excited and nervous to go tomorrow without any Kratom. I just hope that I feel decent enough to get some work done. I think boredom is what bugs me the most. Kratom makes us content when we shouldn’t be. For so long I was content with not making money, living in filth, losing friends/family. It’s been 5 years since I’ve started and the future is exciting but also very scary.

I suffer from a pretty awful panic disorder and kratom was a godsend until it wasn't. The apathetic feeling I had and loss of interest in most things was a big sign that something wasn't right. Not to mention the shitty feeling I had every morning before my first dose. So, I decided to just jump off and boy was I in for a shitty week. 

I would take so many baths, which helped a lot. I would just sit around in the pain my body was going through and as soon as sleep time came around it was like there were worms crawling underneath my skin and nothing I did could make me sleep. The feeling is torture and it will always remind me why this shit is the absolute worst! Every night that week I would end up reaching for my Kratom so I could actually sleep a little. after 5 days of this routine, I gave in and started taking about 15-20 GPD for 3 days because the time I had allowed myself to quit was over and I needed to work and function. 

I finally reached out to my doctor who put me on gabapentin, Seroquel, clonidine, clonidine patches, and a little Klonopin. That was yesterday and I have to say it has made this experience so much easier. The pain is gone and there is no anxiety. However, the creepy crawlies came on hard in the night and I still had to dose last night to get to sleep. I feel like I am climbing Everest and getting through 24 hours Kratom free is my summit.  Gonna keep climbing even if I dont sleep. Tonights the night. FUCK KRATOM!",6

Some things that helped:,"I tried a taper for a couple of days using agmatine and it was uncomfortable, and the thought of dragging it out any longer once I’d decided I was done seemed torturous and pointless. So I went from about 5-6gpd to about 3gpd with agmatine for a couple days and then just stopped. I know it’s a relatively small dose but I’m sensitive to most substances and felt like I became very dependent on it. Have had chronic shoulder, back, and neck pain since I started using it daily. (5-6 months ago) I get irritable and short, I’m spaced out, always looking for distractions or waiting til it’s time for more kratom. I lost control of my own happiness and gave it to a stupid drug. 
Anyways I have not felt the urge to go back since quitting, as I can feel lighter and clearer in so many ways already even with the withdrawal. I feel more present and surprisingly less quick to react even in my current state of heightened irritability. 
The main symptoms I’m having are sleeplessness and restlessness in general (can’t sit still), anxiety and sleepiness, increased sensitivity to pain/pleasure, chills/cold sweats, hot flashes, depression, heartburn, nausea, no appetite.
However a few things have been making a verrrry noticeable difference. 
1. Black seed oil. I see this a lot in here and had to try it, definitely calms the anxiety and restlessness (my least favorite symptoms).
2. A cartridge I picked up that is 40% delta 8 THC and 40% CBN, with some CBD in it as well. I believe it’s the only one of its kind on the market (I know I can’t name the company but look it up!) this has been again very helpful with anxiety and restlessness. Also helps a lot with pain and sleep. 
3. Exercise, rest, and lots of water. Also things I’ve seen on here before but worth noting because they are all extremely effective. I had no appetite and didn’t even want water the first couple days but forcing myself to gulp down a big glass every couple hours made me feel soooo much better immediately. Exercising enough to get my heart rate up (just a light jog or something) also immediately gives me lots of relief. And resting, while ultimately pretty hard to do when you’re quitting, helps me get through the day. I’ve been making sure to be in bed early and to rest whenever I can. My muscles are tired and sore much quicker than normal and laying down helps even if I can’t sleep. 

I think I’m out of the woods and past the worst of it 🤞 today is slightly better than 3-4. Best of luck to everyone else out there! It’s so fucking worth it. ❤️",8

 Every month for 8 years, I would put myself thru oxy withdrawal, then kratom withdrawal.  I tried but quitting didn't stick.  I used kratom liquid extract and powder. 

8 years is 96 months.  Acutes for me lasted 5 days...
Minimum...96mths of going thru 5 days of acute each month is 440 days that I have put my body through acute withdrawals from one substance or another.   NO wonder my body is so angry and resistant to healing.  

The truth is... I used ALOT longer than 8 years... I just couldn't bring myself to do that calculation.

I haven’t really had any adverse affects using (yet), but I just don’t want to continue using and being so dependent on it for that euphoria. 

Over the last week I tried tapering without doing any research and it’s no bueno. 

I do intermittent fasting and wouldn’t use anything after breaking my fast around 7pm.

As I’ve hit my weight loss goals I started breaking my fast around 2pm. For the past week I’ve continued not having kratom after eating (2pm). 

That’s a lot longer throughout the day without kratom and my sleep has been absolute dog shit. I need to re evaluate how I’m doing it because I want to quit but I need my sleep to perform at work. 

Grateful this sub is here and inspired by the guides and success stories!",4

I posted on Tuesday that my last dose was at 12 P.M. I made it about 24 hours and re dosed.  Now Thursday almost 3 P.M. est I am officially over 1D which is the longest Ive gone in at least a few months.  I have seen other people post journals here and I think I will do the same as Its good for the individual and I think for others looking to start this journey. 

As of this morning at around 11 A.M. I took about .2 of Xanax to help me get through the day and I have to say its helped a lot. My plan is to dose xanax slowly through sunday evening to make the withdrawal a little more bearable.  I can see the ups and downs of xanax the down being my brain saying ""if xanax makes this bearable you can continue to use as you know the withdrawals wont be so bad"" and the upside being that at 24 hours in I feel almost completely fine. I am also aware that maybe the W/d just hasn't really hit, but I think ill know tomorrow for sure. 

With the above said I am not gonna use... I feel pretty good about making my way to the other side this time. There are people in my life I want to be there for... 

I woke up at like 5:45 A.M. and by 7 I was outside shoveling.  I think that helped a bit today as it was some good exercise and kept me busy for an hour or so.  Prob gonna go for a walk this afternoon just to get out again.

I don't want to go down that road again since it lead to a messed up food addiction, 60lb weight gain and depression. I went to see an addiction specialist for that, and she mentioned the connection between addictive foods and alcohol/drug use. Her advice was to stay away from addictive foods (sugars, starch and dairy basically;) it helped. I don't notice any major difference today, maybe more yawning and GI stuff, but I don't want to use it as an excuse as to why it might be of to take a bit here and there. Pretty sure we all know where that leads, no matter how much we'd like to believe otherwise. I'm miserable, mentally.

I tried it and would only use once or twice a week for recreational purposes. 
Since quarantine I realized it became a habit where I was using it between 2-4 times a day. 
I didn’t think anything of it being it’s a natural thing and didn’t think I would end up where I am now in this situation.
I had been having bouts of depression and my anxiety issues have worsened over last few months. 
I started thinking the kratom was changing who I was and making me feel empty inside in between doses. 
When I wouldn’t take any for a while I would feel like me again and the minute I started feeling depressed I would take some. It never occurred to me I had created a dependence and the reason for my depression and shit feelings between doses was because of the kratom and the amount I was taking as well as how often. 
Now I decided to quit and I went from 3-4 tbsp per day and none yesterday till 7pm... I started feeling withdrawal symptoms yesterday around lunch time... I went and did my work out and after lunch felt like total crap... then took one dose at 7. 
I couldn’t sleep well at all and have been having sweats, hot flashes, and chills.. really bad fatigue and body aches especially in my legs. 
I have a lot I do on a daily basis and am thinking I may be better off just tapering off instead of cold turkey- which is why I took the one dose yesterday at 7pm. This morning was hell and I decided I shouldn’t jump from 4 tbsp to 1 because I’m still suffering enough to wanna crawl in a hole. 
I don’t know much about this so I’m wondering what I can do to help this and how would be the easiest way to taper down successfully and be done with withdrawal completely. 
I want to go back to being able to use it for fun maybe once or twice on weekends as intended..I hate being dependent on it and I hate how it makes me feel as it’s wearing off. I’m not myself anymore because of how often I take it and I hate it got to this point. I know there’s a light at the end but damn this sucks.

I'm bored and blah enough to the point where I crave anything to make the days more exciting.  I don't have those ""switch flipped"" moments that people refer to as a moment where they know they won't ever use again.  No, for me, it is a tougher, more grueling battle... but a battle I must keep fighting and win.  

I exercise at least 20 minutes a day, I'm eating relatively healthy, work is going pretty good, good health.  I mean I don't really have anything to complain about besides being bored and slightly *off,* which kind of makes it worse in a way.  Like why can't I just get over it and enjoy all of the good in my life?  In the past, I've caved because I get impatient and rationalize that taking kratom and getting excited about things is better than not taking kratom and feeling blah forever.  

I know that isn't an option this time.  I don't trust myself, but at the same time, I know I can't go back again.  I need to keep coming back here and reaching out in moments of weakness.  On that note, if anyone else has a similar story, hopefully with a happy ending, they would be willing to share, it would be much appreciated.  Maybe a lot of it is also seasonal/covid lockdown related?

I want to avoid precipitated withdrawals, but due mostly to my doctors schedule I'm supposed to take it at 11 AM tomorrow morning.

We separated due to our relationship just not working out. Now that we are seperated I am doing this on my own. Completely on my own. I have no house right now and I am currently living with a friend on their couch but they do not know that I am about to probably get super sick in the next day from withdrawals. I have used every single day for about 3 years. Started off slowly but I was eventually taking about 5 dosages of capsuals a day about 12-15 each time. No one in my family knows what I am about to go through and all I have is my car to hide my withdrawals from everyone. Does anyone have any thing to say on how to be productive all day when you are all alone? I know I can do this and I have the mentality to never touch it again. I threw it in the trash and told myself “my life will be happier without you controlling me. This is my life and I will take control of my life for now on and live to be happy and set free. “ and walked away. For myself most importantly but also my son he is my everything and kratom has really changed me in so many ways and I see that looking back at everything. Any advice?

Thanks guys. Hope you all the best through this horrible drug we all are suffering and remember that this too shall pass.",8

So many people on this sub helped me, most who I never even talked to, but reading their stories and recognizing myself in them changed my whole understanding of what I am going through. 2 solid years of use, and only now do I recognize how much of that time is blurred. Every day was a chore to make it through to my next dose. For those lurking out there, still on the fence about jumping or committing to a taper, it's so worth it. I can think more clearly, and am starting to feel more connected to those around me. To those in the acutes, hang tough! Keep checking in.

Could it be my fast metabolism? I’m very thin and I don’t tend to gain weight even after consuming a lot of calories without working out. But I’m not certain about any of this. 

Might things get worse in the next 24 hours? I’m terrified that I’ve got a false sense of confidence right now. For reference I’ve been taking kratom for about a year and some change before this current quit.

I tapered unintentionally only because I kept relapsing. I’d make it 3,4, 5 days at most and take some. I was a slave to the liquid extract shots. I’d take any type of kratom I could get my hands on but those liquid shots were my go to from when I first started. 

I was using for 2.5 years. Towards the end, I actually thought I might never be able to stop. I told myself every day was going to be my last day for a year - and the insane part is that I meant it (or at least I wanted to). 

All I can say is that we are stronger than we think we are. We can do more than we give ourselves credit for. And we for sure, without a doubt can stop putting this nasty poison into our bodies. 

My life is SO much better. I thought I’d feel like shit for the rest of my life. I thought I needed kratom to feel good or at the least - normal. Thank God I was wrong. Thank God my thoughts and fears were not real - (they usually aren’t - keep that in mind). My thoughts and fears prevented me from stopping for far too long. But I overcame and conquered this addiction and I’m grateful every day.

I could only think as far as the first few nights of withdrawal feeling like shit and no sleep. Tbh i kinda expected it all to go away by day 5 but that obviously didnt happen.

I know going back to smoking or anything is just gonna hinder my progress so i gotta push thru and get used to living like this. But everyday im enjoying myself a little more, tbh mornings are the best when i make myself work out and take a cold shower and wim hof and eat breakfast and drink a tea/coffee but after that my brain is like okay what now. What do i do to stimulate myself. I cant do WHM or pushups all day, and its still really hard to focus on doing a bigger project. Finally mass filling out job aps tho. Hopefully this will get better once i start working again and getting money, cause being broke definately doesnt make you feel better lol. Its the main reason i quit kratom when i did, i literally could not afford to get more without doing some scummy shit or selling drugs again and im not tryna get arrested again ive been lucky enough in court to only have a reckless driving (from a dui) stick to my record.

Just wanted give back as I’ve lurked on this sub many, many times to gauge whether or not what I was feeling was “normal” during the many stages Kra wd.  
Having a forum like this has been tremendously helpful in my journey away from Kra.  
I’ve not used this substance in 154 days.  I was pretty heavily addicted to Percocet for 3-4 years and subsequently, Kra for 2+ years.  I was at about 60-80gpd for the majority of my using and weaned down to about 30-40gpd the last month; at which time I went cold turkey.  
My acute withdrawal was heinous.  It lasted 7-10 days.  The RLS was by far the worst of the symptoms as it left me unable to sleep, but thoroughly exhausted.  After too many nights of no sleep I contacted a naturopathic doctor and he prescribed me a beta blocker (to help with the crippling anxiety) and a prescription for 20 5mg Vicodin.  This may seem controversial and perhaps counterintuitive but they were the only thing that allowed me a few hours of sleep.  It’s common in parts of Europe for doctors to prescribe a short rx of a mild opiate to mitigate symptoms of Kra wd a bit (I’m in the US so I had to provide the doctor with examples of this practice).  I took one every six or so hours and although it didn’t help too much, it allowed for some sleep when the insomnia was making me feel like I was losing my mind.  
I also took 500mg of Magnesium a day and drank as much water and vitamins as my body would allow.  Flushing your system can speed up the wd process. Epsom salt baths actually helped a bit with the RLS.  They would provide some temporary relief which was a Godsend. 
After the acutes were over, the anhedonia told hold.  I experienced really crushing depression for about two weeks.  I knew it was going to pass so I did whatever I had to do to get through it (talked incessantly with friends and family about what I was going through, walked, a lot, ate as healthy as I could and continued to drink a fuckton of water).  I’ve always suffered from depression so I’m not trying to be discouraging or give too much of a bleak outlook.  This may not happen to everyone. 
After day 28 or so things started to improve.  The depression was still there but significantly lighter.  I still had little energy but I forced myself to do things every day (and watched a lot of funny television and movies) and reminded myself that I’m recovering from a long habit of pounding opiates into my system.  I tried to be as loving and compassionate as I could with myself.  I don’t see the use in beating ourselves up for having an addiction.  I used bc I was in tremendous psychological pain, as I’m sure is the case for a lot of ppl. 
I felt another shift after about day 45.  Things began to improve a bit more.  Slowly, my energy came back (I’m 41 so this may have taken longer for me) and I began to feel more like my old self.  I stated liking music again (holy shit, music saved my life during this ordeal) and feeling the importance of CONNECTION with other ppl.  I can’t stress enough how important this one was for me.
The third month started to get tricky for me.  I think it probably was PAWS.  I battled through this month, and much of the fourth month but nothing to the degree that it was in the beginning.  This is when I really needed to lean into people and practice complete and utter self love.  I believe this is what kept me going.  I read a lot on here about the third and fourth month being tricky for some ppl so it was very helpful to know what I was experiencing was somewhat normal and more importantly, that it would end.  
These last few weeks have been, by far, the best I’ve felt in many, many years.  I feel like I’m almost all the way back.  I don’t know what normal is.  Normalcy can be redefined many times throughout ones life . I suppose I just feel very close to who my true self really is.  It’s a great feeling actually.  
I haven’t had any desire for opiates or Kra.  I was done.  It wreaked havoc on my body, my mind, my soul (insanely scary tachycardia, intense anxiety, complete apathy, hair loss, malabsorption). 
I apologize for the incredibly long post.  I just wanted to be as thorough and honest as possible.  I really could never imagine going three hours without Kra, let alone 154 days.  If you pray, pray a fuckton throughout your journey.  If you meditate, do that a fuckton.  Whatever you have to do to make it through, (short of eating ppl or anything weird) do it.  
It’s a hard road but holy shit, it’s worth it.  Every week gets better, easier and more manageable.  
If anyone needs anything, please always reach out.  I’m here.  Much love ❤️",81

I don’t know exactly how much I’ve been taking because I’m on the liquid extracts. I’ve tried to quit so many times but tomorrow is day 1 for me. I’ve stopped the liquid and just had the pills a few times when I went out of town, and felt like shit everyday and couldn’t wait to get the liquid. I just feel so stupid I’m still dancing around with this bullshit. 

I started kratom innocently, I was on heroin for years, and then suboxone, and then the kratom to get off the suboxone. It helped so much with the withdrawals but now I’m like what’s the point?! Should’ve just kicked initially instead of strung it along for years. 

It has destroyed my self esteem, my financial security, everything. I lost my job because of the pandemic and kratom is expensive. Luckily I have an amazing supportive partner who is aware of everything. 

Hoping and praying I can do it this time! So sick of feeling like this.",6

I love to workout and I thought Kratom was helping me go to the gym by making me feel euphoric. This made working out that much more enjoyable. Or so I thought.... I quit Kratom 6 days ago and I’m feeling back to normal for the most part. The gym is 10x better being off Kratom. It way easier to get a pump now. I think the Kratom had something in it to make the pump go away. Maybe some type of anti inflammatory compound in it. It wasn’t always like that. The gym and the pump was good at first when I started taking Kratom but over time it depleted my gains almost entirely. I got weaker. Just being off Kratom for 6 days my pump is back in full effect. I can lift heavier. It’s the weirdest thing. For anyone that goes to the gym getting strength gains in 1 week is laughable. But I promise I have gotten stronger. I think something in the Kratom was causing my muscles not to expand to bring in more oxygen in. Like the strength was always there but the Kratom diminished it. Maybe it’s in my head but damn the gym is so nice without Kratom. I now get dopamine from working out instead of from the Kratom I consumed before I went into the gym. And if I didn’t consume enough I just wanted to leave the gym to take more so I could feel better... lol so weak of me.. it’s nice to get a natural high instead of the green sludge.

This is my personal experience talking, and I don't have any studies to cite about kratom, so that's purely where this is coming from. I lost my insurance for a bit, and had to stop taking my antidepressant. That's when I started taking kratom, and got myself pretty addicted. I went through the whole withdrawal and relapse process a few times until I got new health insurance. I started taking wellbutrin again, and just kind of stopped taking kratom. I didn't make a point of doing it, it just kind of stopped working so I stopped taking it. I didn't notice any withdrawals or cravings, I just stopped. Wellbutrin was the only thing that I had started doing differently. Wellbutrin blocks certain nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, as well as being a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, and it really seems to block the effects of kratom. If kratom acts through that pathway, sort of like a super nicotine, it would explain a lot about its effects. It would also explain why wellbutrin seemed to work for quitting. It's a common antidepressant that is also prescribed for smoking cessation, so it can be used short term without serious withdrawal symptoms and most doctors are pretty open to prescribing it.",7

I had tapered down to basically 1-2 GPD so it wasn’t that bad.

My experience thus far - day two was the only real shitty day which was basically defined by lethargy. Day 1 I was super motivated and happy to quit and much of day 3 as well. Day 4 was back to work and I was able to keep pretty motivated all week and didn’t feel too bad during the day. I have been working out twice per day which has helped with serotonins and general well being. Nighttime have been loading up on CBD and melatonin. First week I slept 3-5 hours per night and now I am at around 7 which I am pleased with. Yesterday and today I began getting the cravings - the first 10 days I was just happy to be free from the sludge. It wasn’t a physical craving more of “how do I deal with boredom at the office?”. I have a good job with an interesting company but GD the K has gotten me through some boring days at the office. Down the street from my gym there is actually and Kratom/kava bar that makes the best Kratom drinks, very refreshing. Went to the gym today at lunch and was convinced I would stop by and grab a drink on my way back to work. Made the right decision and skipped it... phew. 

Anyway just wanted to share my story, which so far has been pretty good. No horrible withdrawals which I give credit to my taper ahead of the jump. And tons of physical workouts that have helped physiologically and also sleep.

Good luck everyone!!",12
2020-12-15 20:03:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/kdyvxh/came_clean_to_my_significant_other/,Came clean to my significant other,"I came clean to my fiance two weeks after I quit. I thought the nightmare would be over once I was clean, but I had kept it a secret from her for 6 months, and it was eating me alive. I needed to know that she loved me for who I was, and that she could love me through hard times and bad times before we got married.

When I told her she broke down in tears. We slept in separate beds that night and continued to fight for days. I thought she was going to leave me.

We're still working through it. Part of me is sad and disappointed that she hasn't been able to see kratom addiction for what it really is: a sickness that eats you from the inside out.

She is the only person I've told that doesn't have any experience with opioids or addiction, and that's one of the reasons I hesitated for so long to tell her. Until you've been crushed by an addiction, you have no idea what it means to be addicted. Even now, a month clean, the severity of the addiction makes less sense than it did a month ago. It's like looking back on a bad relationship and you think ""WTF was I thinking?!""

One thing I've gained in this experience is compassion. When I see junkies on the side of the road or at a gas station, I want to cry. I know the hell they must live in every day, the desperation to stave off for one more day the harsh sober reality of what their lives have become. Because at the end of the day, it wasn't just the fear of withdrawal that kept me locked in my cage, it was the fear of having that day of reckoning when I would have to face, sober, what I had become, and start the long, hard process of turning this ship around. Sober.",37

What’s the timeline. Anyone else is experience these more subtle bouts of anxiety/depression. How long did it last? 

Tell you what, I am doing my research before ever picking up a “supplement” again. Ordered phenibute a few months back, and thank god I did the research on that one. Threw it out the moment I got it. Not sure if Kratom is a better solution for pain or anxiety or not, but anecdotally, this was not a good experience. Stuff needs to be regulated to some degree just so consumers can be informed.",3

So currently, I’m on kratom, phenibut and excedrin pills (APAP, aspirin and caffeine) 

I take a total of 24-27 grams of kratom a day
3-4 grams of phenibut a day
1,040 mg of caffeine a day from the excedrin pills. 

I take 3.5 grams of kratom as soon as I wake up (7 AM) along with .8 mg of phenibut and two excedrin pills (130 mg caffeine) 

I dose 3.5 grams of kratom in two hour intervals, as well as 2 excedrin pills with each dose (130 mg caffeine) , every two hours until I go to bed. 

At 2 or 3 PM , I do my regular kratom and excedrin dose with 1 gram of phenibut. 

At 8 PM, I do my regular dose with 1.2-1.4 grams of phenibut. 

11 PM I take my final dose of kratom with 1 excedrin & no phenibut. 

This has been routine everyday for the past two years , I started the excedrin pills a year ago because it synergies very well with kratom and phenibut but now all it does is give me a little boost for 30 minutes then I begin feeling so fatigued. 
Not to mention it gives me headaches every other day no matter how much water I drink. 

I’m so tired almost all day. And I’m not doing my kidneys any favors with the Aspirin and APAP in the excedrin.

If I can help it , I would like to stay on the kratom but maybe lower the dosage because I suffer from chronic pain and it’s really been the only thing helping me, although I’m sure it contributes to the fatigue I feel everyday.

I don’t even know where or how to start tapering off of everything. But I know I need to quit, it’s not sustainable and it’s a huge financial burden. 


I would like to start off very slowly, as I have to stay functional for my job and I’m a single father who never has a moment to relax until bed time. Any help or input would be appreciated , I apologize for the wall of text.",5

I can’t really find anything that fits my particular situation","So today I kind of had that realization that I am truly powerless when it comes to kratom. I’ve sworn it off before but never took it seriously enough. I’m ready to take it seriously now. 

So I’m trying to figure out what WDs might look like for me. Ive used kratom at least once a week for the past two years, and I’ve been a somewhat heavy user since the beginning of quarantine. The first month I used it every day, then I cut back I’ve stayed at about 1-3 times a week since then (during these times I would usually take like 8-16g per use, sometimes a full ounce.) 


The past two weeks tho, I’ve been taking it daily usually like 8-16 Gpd. I’m really worried it’s spiraling out of control, mainly because I’ve had like 5 different times where I tell myself “ok this is the last one” and then I make an excuse to get more the next day. 

Does anyone have advice for fighting against the mental urge? My brain will really pull out all the stops to justify getting more, and after I take it I’m like damn this was a dumb idea, but the next day the cycle repeats. Ik it’s only been 2 weeks of daily use, but I’m really starting to feel trapped in a loop with this. I also had tried to quit when I was using 1-3 times per week and was unsuccessful. The weight of my past failiures is making this feel really scary. And also could anyone tell me what my WDs might look like? I’m not gonna taper bc I don’t have the self control.

Also I should mention I was never addicted to any other drug. I just started using this recreationally",2

I swear it seemed so harmless and I’ve heard little complaints until I looked deeper into it. I feel desperate that I’ll need to keep taking this random shit that scientists don’t even know much about to not go crazy. 5 days ago I decided to quit. I was taking 3 or 4 extract shots a day. capsules, powder, anything that wasn’t liquid mitragynine extract wouldn’t do it. For 5 days I’ve been keeping my system empty until the 48 hour mark, where I will take 7 capsules to catch up on the sleep I missed from the previous night. I just feel as if a lack of sleep can only make me feel much worse. How far will that set me back? I took a lot of this and I know it might take longer than expected, but I’m desperate. Will I feel like this forever? It’s such a dumb rhetorical question but my mind is convincing itself that I’ll be stuck feeling like this for the long term. A friend got me gaba supplements which I’m just a tad worried about because gaba is infamous for horrific consequences of alcohol and benzodiazepines.I’ve been hydrating, crap tons of vitamin c.

Ive been posting on here for a few months with the intention of quitting, but have just not been able to take the plunge.  I plan on quitting tomorrow taking my last dose sometime in the late morning.  If I take the dose in the morning I think ill be able to at least get some sleep tomorrow night.  So the real journey with WD will start Wednesday morning.  I just cant go into this next year using Kratom... I want to start the next year on the right foot. 

I have been using for about 6 months now and have been using probably about 30-40 GPD so the withdrawals will probably be quite unpleasant. I have about 10mg of xanax I plan to help me get through the first 5 days, but want to be 100% sober by next Monday. I rarely use xanax so Im not even sure that ill need 10mg, but I have it just incase as failure is not an option. I have planned a trip to a warmer climate where I have some family end of december, so I basically have two weeks to get through the worse of the WD which I think is plenty of time. 

For those of you who have recently gotten clean.  By what day do you start to feel over the hump? Since I am quitting tomorrow is it fair to say that by next Monday I should be able to work?

I saw someone post in another thread they are looking for an accountability partner.  If there are any strangers out there that would like to chat through the reddit chat while we quit kratom let me know.  Would be nice to have some support.

Edit: 12:15 P.M. took my last dose hopefully forever.  Gonna try to update in here daily.",9

I was on Suboxone for 12 years. My main problem was heroin but I'd do anything I could get my hands on; Oxy, methadone, opium. So I quit taking the Suboxone 48 days ago, but to cushion the withdrawals I took tramadol. Once I was through the worst of the Sub withdrawals (days 8-14 more or less) I started tapering the tramadol. Two weeks ago I quit taking that, but now I've been taking kratom in what I think are small doses. No more than 8-10 grams a day and it helps to a degree but I still kicked pretty hard. Now I'm feeling better. In a way I've been climbing down the opiate ladder, and I know that the kratom is probably prolonging the withdrawals but hopefully it's making them less miserable too. I've got enough to taper over a week or two, but I'm wondering if just quitting it is a better idea.",4

2020-12-14 18:09:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/kd90r3/my_story_using_kratom_to_manage_depression_and/,"My Story - Using Kratom to Manage Depression, and Quitting a 15gpd Habit","A little background: I started using Kratom on a daily basis after moving away from a Medical Marijuana state. While weed wasn’t the best for me, either: I needed a new way to deal with my anxiety, stress, and depression. So I turned to a mix of Kratom and Nootropics.

While a lot of my research on strains, vendors, and benefits came from the main Kratom subreddit, I had read some posts on here - which made me careful about dosage. I knew what would happen if I became a 20-60gpd guy. So I started with 3G/dose, three times a day. Then added a little to the second and third dose; eventually topping out at about 15GPD.

Like most people: I thought it worked well for a while. Work was less awful to get through, I felt more sociable, and generally was in a more positive mood. 

Then the indigestion became obvious. I gained nearly 20 pounds until I started taking regular MetaMucil and Magnesium Citrate to deal with it. Tolerance became a problem, so I’d take Agmatine Sulfate. Price became a problem, so I took advantage of vendor sales by buying two kilos at a time. Eventually I had enough and tried to stop.

My first attempt (cold turkey) was God-awful. I had insane amounts of anxiety, digestive issues, and could barely sleep. I broke down after a few days and relapsed.

My final attempt, two months ago, was more informed. 
- I started with 3g, 3x a day and tapered by a half gram per dose each week until I hit zero.
- I used Agmatine between doses.
- I used a series of Sleep Supplements every night.
- I used a series of Anti-Anxiety supplements throughout each day.
- I used a mix of Immodium and probiotics when the digestive issues got out of control.

It’s been over two months since I started the taper, and about a month now of being at zero. There were a few days in the middle where the lack of sleep, high anxiety, and explosive diarrhea caused me to cap up an emergency dose. Funny enough: that didn’t relieve anything. It seems my body is as done with this plant as my mind is.

All in all, it feels I’ve generally made it to the other side. If you’re just starting to taper: keep going. If you’re considering quitting: do it. 

*This isn’t the “Miracle Plant” that undiagnosed depressives rave about on the other SubReddit.* This is a poorly extracted opioid with risks large enough that its own country of origin banned it. Most of the Arab SmokeShop owners pushing it don’t even use it. They’re just raking in money from all the hipster white kids that keep coming back. The online companies are no better. They don’t care about you, and the FDA is one step away from shutting them all down for good. Value your life. You’re better than that. ✌️",10

Maintaining my recovery is the challenging part for me.  I can make it here, where life is okay without drugs or alcohol, but I've relapsed so many times after getting here.

Don’t give up. Take your recovery day by day and be patient. Withdrawal fucking sucks. Worse thing I ever been through and I don’t plan on ever going back. The pain I went through was a harsh reminder to respect my body more and not alter it’s natural chemical balances. I went through hell for about 1.5 months straight. 24/7 shit show. Then things started to even out. PAWS would come in waves. It was still hard but manageable. After 3 months, I think I’m back to normal. I’m happy and healthy. Still doing my cardio which helped me throughout the withdrawal process. I haven’t had any PAWS for over a month now and I just try to pretend I never touched Kratom. It’s a dirty high. 

If you think you’re losing your mind or you think you won’t ever be the same. I’m here to tell your that is not true. Soon enough it will be like you never took this shit and you’ll be back to normal. That’s a promise.",25

Anyone take this after withdrawal from kratom to keep from substituting with alcohol? I’ve had high cravings to take anything I can to feel something (except for kratom and opiates) so I turn to alcohol which I’ve had not a huge problem with but it’s a ‘more often than not’ kind of thing. 

I’m not familiar with naltrexone other than it keeps you from feeling euphoria or a buzz and doesn’t actually activate the opioid receptors like subs. I have heard stories of bad side effects. However I still think it’s worth a try if it can help me help my brain in this healing process.

Just curious of others opinions on it and wether they’ve had success with it or why they would oppose it. 

I will be opening up to my doctor about everything and also asking her opinion on it.

The smoke shops had all closed and my husband was out of work for weeks because of covid so it just made sense. I was an alcoholic for 20 years and honestly I’ve always had trouble with just about everything in excess . I’m not trying to be discouraging to anyone at all but quitting kratom had the absolute worst effect on me that anyone could’ve imagined . I was completely unprepared for the sleepless nights and hot flashes and extreme fatigue and just general complete suicidal state of mind quitting put me through. It made me feel so terrible that I promised myself there was no way I would ever EVER try it again. (I had been using 60 grams a day for about 7 months) At the end of may after two months of very long days where I just walked back and forth in my house crying I decided to start taking it again. I needed sone relief from the constant sadness . I decided that if I could show my husband that it didn’t have to be so expensive (I had been paying for it through smoke shops), or that the effect on me weren’t as noticeable maybe he would understand why I started again after he Tried so hard to help me quit before. Here it is seven months later and he still doesn’t know. It kills me to have this giant secret from him and also it kills me that Im so tethered to this damn powder, it has such a hold on me.  I’ve promised myself all weekend that I’m just going to come out with it but I’m afraid that the prospect of trying to help me through this a second time will have a devastating effect on our marriage. How do I stop with a two year old to take care of? My withdrawals before were seemingly insurmountable and I used copious amounts of marijuana to help me through. I want to be rid of this thing . I want my unadulterated mind back. I don’t want to be a sneak or a liar . I want a clear understanding of the world. I’m terrified to stop and I want to more than anything",14

It all started on November 13th when I decided to quit CT but I actually ended up taking only what i needed to get me through the day. The first week of accelerated tapering was actually the hardest. It was way harder than the first few days of being clean. If you're going to taper, dont do what I did because I think it just made me feel miserable for longer than necessary. 

Most of these doses were broken up into multiple smaller doses throughout the day.

Nov 13th: 8g

Nov 14th: 2g

Nov 15th: 20g

Nov 16th: 12g

Nov 17th: 11g

Nov 18th: 7.5g

Nov 19th: 10g

Nov 20th: first clean day. 0g

Nov 21st to Dec 3rd: 13 more days clean

Dec 3rd: 12g. I found a little baggie of kratom in my cupboard and couldn't resist.

Dec 4th: 12g. I finished the rest of the baggie. It really didnt even feel good. I was disappointed afterwards.

Dec 5th to dec 7th: 3 days clean. No additional withdrawals except some minor yawning. 

Dec 8th: 100mg tramadol. I found an old prescription and instantly put a pill in my mouth but then I remembered tramadol doesnt give me euphoria, it just makes me tired so I flushed the rest of the bottle down the toilet.

Dec 9th to Dec 12th: 4 more days clean. 

So my longest time clean was 14 days. The 3 relapses later set me back a little bit but not by much. I still feel fine, no yawning, no anxiety, no RLS, etc. But I'm still having a hard time with fatigue and sleeping more then 4 to 5 hours at a time. I havent had a full 8 hour uninterrupted night of sleep in a month. Sometimes I crash in the afternoon and take a 1 or 2 hour nap if my body is really exhausted.

I met a new girl and I've been getting laid too which has probably kept me from giving up on quitting. Sometimes my sex drive is there, sometimes it isn't. But wanting to be clean next time I see her is the little motivation I have right now because I'm so tired. It's been a really long month. I just want to rest. 😔",1

I've tried to quit a few times. The furthest I got was 5 days. My dose has at least doubled since then. I need to quit, but I worry I'll buckle under the pain again if I try. Living sober is hard enough, withdrawal is even harder. I can get through Oxy withdrawal but for some reason kratom is so much worse.

Has kratom made anyone else feel like this? Did your intelligence recover after you quit? I'm terrified that it won't and that this is permanent.",11

2020-12-12 17:56:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/kbyxr1/kratom_is_like_skipping_xp_experience_points/,Kratom is like skipping XP (experience points),"If you play video games you know the best way to level up is through ""XP"", which equates to ""experience points"" to non-gamers.  To most, if not all, a player tends to want to gain as much XP as possible thus allowing the player to advance and unlock things in the game. Better clothing options, better weapons, better dialogue options, better skills, etc... You need XP to grow or else you'll be at level 1 the entire time and unable to move forward in-game.

Taking drugs (*like Kratom*) to avoid and escape the uncomfortable things in our lives is basically the equivalent of being faced with a mission in game and instead of tackling it head on, *to gain XP*, you buy and use an in-game item that allows your character to have a quick glimpse of what this game really has to offer, but only for a few seconds and you lose that potential XP from that mission.

At first, it might seem fun to take a quick peak at what lies on the other side, but after awhile, the duration of what you see and feel begins to shrink and obtaining this illusive item becomes more expensive on your wallet because in order to feel and see that same glimpse, you must take more and more of it.  While you continue to evade missions that might be a challenge at first, but would result in XP granted to your character, you'll be stuck at a lower level. Your friends and family, who've been playing the game and beating missions as they come, are leveling up without you. Sure, you can still gain a little XP here and there, but ultimately you are stunting the growth of your character and are unable to do and/or experience some of the things they are able to due to higher XP levels.

Kratom has done more harm than good in my life. Today I am battling a STRONG urge to grab some. Just one shot. Just one... last time... it will feel so amazing (*or so I tell myself*).

But then I started to think of all the CONS of using and how much I will lose if I continue to take something that is robbing me of XP in my life. I question how much further ahead in this game we call life would be if I never took Kratom 4 years ago?

Would I still be married?

Would I have kids?

Would I be more wealthy?

Where would I be in my career?

What could my life have been if I never started this?

&#x200B;

I then get depressed and slowly convince myself, *""you know what you need? You need that item! That item that will give you a glimpse, a fleeting feeling of completeness, a feeling of content, the feeling of a warm blanket wrapping around your body while a voice whispers into your ear that everything is perfectly fine...""* \--

&#x200B;

But no, I can't. I can't do this to myself AGAIN.

I want to grow as a person.

I want to experience this game as it was intended to be played!

But with that, comes this pang of pain, an emptiness that nothing but that drug can fill, the same feeling you might get when your alarm clock wakes you up on a Monday... I don't want to feel this! I hate this! I hate being sad! I hate being tired! I hate being uninterested in things I once loved!

I hate being me...

&#x200B;

It hurts to think about how much kratom has ruined my life.

&#x200B;

I did so much Kratom to block emotions of pain. I didn't want to face my wife leaving me, so I took Kratom. I didn't want to deal with the death of my sister, so I took kratom. I didn't want to face the fact that I am not working hard enough at my career because I am flat out burnt the fuck out, so I take kratom... and if I have to hear another character who started the game at level 100 due to nepotism to tell me that I need to do A, B, C, and D while dancing on the top of my fucking head-- just to get to level 2, I'll want to take kratom.

This game of life is hard. Hard for most of us at least. But great games are inherently hard because if they weren't, well, they'd probably be boring.  And instead of playing this game, I chose to run away from the missions I was presented with all because they felt too difficult to face.

I needed an escape... So I took that item that's called Kratom.

It gave me a quick glimpse of what my life could have looked like at a higher level, but only for a few seconds.",16

This last week has given me a ton of fear of the dreaded PAWS. Reading posts about people going through it.  Them still struggling gave me major anxiety. I told a friend of mine who’s been through the ringer with opiates about my struggle and he responded with something that helped set me straight. 
“Fuck PAWS.. Paws is a fancy word for people who can’t stay sober.” I’m not discounting anyone’s experience because I’ve been guilty of this for 7 years. But seriously, Fuck PAWS. Life sucks some times and if you’ve been high like I have for 7 years. Being sober is gonna suck even more for the next year at least. Time to pay up.

I feel like I'm not much in control of my mind, some disconnect that's slowed my brain down. I'm taking mental clarity herbs and mushrooms like Lions Mane and Milky Oat Tops to reform nervous system in the brain and all that stuff. If you are thinking of relapsing, fuck off. Don't do it. This stuff is satan. I thought it was my wonderdrug 3 years ago. I didn't understand it, lack of education and forward talk about it in the online world besides this reddit feed.

How I miss that. My neurons must be damaged. I'm fucking pissed and I want to sue someone.

On the flip side, it does get better. I feel like a new person in some ways. I don't want this to all be negative because I'm normally an extremely positive guy.

Day 69 off 15gpd 2.5 years of abuse.,"I had a particularly bad week this time I'm not going to blame PAWS.  The circumstances of this week brought about heightened anxiety levels and reminded me why I reached for kratom in the first place.  

I realized that life can suck at times and we all need to push through and not take the easy way out.  I realized that my abuse was a direct result of me trying to avoid something I was not comfortable taking head on.  Instead I reached for an escape.  

It's easy to reach for a drug to numb the anxiety.  It's easy to reach for a drug to try to numb the pain.  It's easy to reach for a drug to help you avoid situations that you don't want to be in. 

What's hard is facing life head on and doing the right thing.  What's hard is pushing through adversity and gaining physical and mental strength in the process.  What's hard is to keep going when there is no end in sight.  

I'm here sitting on a rock pile writing this post.  I'm 20 miles in to a 40 mile trail ride right now.  My right knee is on fire.  Likely patellar tendonitis. I just popped 800mg  ibuprofen and compression wrapped my knee to try to bring down the inflammation.  I'm only halfway home.  Every 10 or so pedal stokes elicits a sharp pain that shoots straight up my leg.  I could call it quits right now and call a friend to pick me up but I won't.  I'm gonna take it easy and slowly limp home.  Yes it sucks.  Will it kill me? Probably not.  But, part of my recovery is training my mind not to give up and push through the self talk to accomplish small goals.  I won't give up when I'm sad, I won't give up cause it hurts, I'll give up when I'm done.",5

I started taking kratom in mid March of 2018. I used in everyday until 5 days ago. 

Of course there were a handful of occasions where I would run out earlier than anticipated and would go out of my way to fetch more. I would have to drive 2 hours to a neighboring state to get it. 

Although this was highly inconvenient for me, I was not ready to quit. My skin and bones would begin to ache after 4-6 hours from my last dose.  The feeling of moving through quicksand and lack of motivation would set in too. Usually I would have to wait until the next day to leave the state to re-up, leaving me 18-36 hours out from my last dose before re-upping. So with nearly 3 years of use, I had never gone more than 36 hours without it. 

For the past few months I really knew I needed to quit. I research many peoples experience so I would know what to expect. I told enough close friends that I was about to quit, which gave me enough momentum to flush the 8 oz I had down the toilet. 

The next day I bought a high quality full spectrum CBD tincture, and an over the counter herbal “Anxiety Soother” (from Kroger) with kava, Passion flower, bacopa herb, albuzia bark, and lavender flower extracts. 

I’ve had little symptoms and this is day 5 without the Krat!!

My motivation is still pretty absent, and sleeping is still pretty restless without an over the counter sleep aid. But I feel ever hopeful and grateful. 

One should still do their own research. These remedies may not work for everyone, and I’ve read kava can become somewhat habit forming depending on the individual and I would advise against using kava with alcohol. 

I’m riding in the car rn and feeling carsick from typing Lol so I’mma wrap it up. I can provide much more details if anyone requests, but I really really feel like this concoction is working for me. I can provide an update in a week or so. Much love and faith to everyone looking for a change. <33",9

I first began taking it to get off a minor heroin addiction which it worked great with a strong mentality of wanting to quit. Well, In November of 2019 I became hooked on snorting heroin again, in which that lasted untill may 25th when I nodded off at my jobs parking lot while on break chilling in my car which resulted in me losing my job. I then went through 2 days of a hellish W/D WHILE taking kratom (maybe because my body was used to taking kratom for so many years?). I then seen a doctor and began MAT treatment with suboxone. After a couple months I began sublocade (best decision of my life). That leads to now, i quit kratom 4 days ago when I finally got sick and tired of relying on cups of kratom every day. So far, I’ve been feeling GREAT and plan on continuing to stay OFF the kratom. Thanks.

Edit: I started buprenorphine treatment to get off Heroin. Reason why I say Sublocade has been the best decision of my life is because it’s a once monthly injection under the skin in the abdomen area. I no longer rely on having to take multiple doses throughout the day and never have to worry about forgetting  a dose. I was taking kratom everyday ever since I got off the shit the first time about 4 years ago.",4

I quit for 44 days maybe 4 or 5 months ago and that quit is still pretty fresh in my mind and body so I feel I am building off of the previous.

I have a lot of things going for me this new beginning as well. I am away from home and on the road. I am with my Wife and Baby while my other Child is with her mother for the holidays. Being out of one's element has always been a lot of help for me when it comes to quitting.  In fact, I was just considering earlier when I had spend 10 years hooked on Painkillers / Heroin my only quits were when I had forced myself into a position of not having a choice. Jail, Moving States, Detox Centers these were the only times I was able to abstain temporarily. With kratom it hasn't been as serious and I have had several periods of abstinence in the last 3 years of continued use.

Here is what I'm committing to these next few days. 

\-Drinking  ALOTTTA Water

\-Taking supplements (Black Seed Oil, Herbal Anxiety / Relaxation, Elderberry Gummy, Natural Pain Relief supplement (Non Opiod)

\-Stretching

\-Working out

\-Being Mindful

\-Playing Music

\-Moving through cravings / Meltdowns

\-Taking space for myself

\- Lots of Music

I'm kind of becoming an expert at quitting at this point. I am well versed on what helps for me and what doesn't. These all help so much. Feeling emotions again helps so much. It is like going back into a dark cloud for an unknown time every time I take kratom again. It is like being reborn everytime I let it go again. I hope this is the last time. I have gotten better at life through all this shit and gotten a lot better at loving myself, taking care of myself. There was a time not long ago that I was a young father that didn't give a shit about my life because I was so stuck on escaping and it was all I had ever known or been taught. I have come so far since then and am providing my family with experiences that I never had growing up.

&#x200B;

Coming off this shit is like an emotional rollercoaster. Its beautiful man. It's been a long time. I hope you decide to quit soon if you haven't already. It's been a hell of a year and quitting kratom 2020 seems like it may be the best way to cap it off.

Bless! Stay Strong!

Im tapering cause i have a kid to care for. Things seem to be going alright. Just moody and a little lethargic.

2020-12-11 17:00:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/kbccfg/reflecting_the_kratom_analog/,~ Reflecting the Kratom Analog ~," 

Been doing kratom for over a decade.

In the beginning I would do kratom on the weekends or on special occasions.

Very much off and on.

Initially I made the mistake of chasing the extremely subtle & elusive ‘high.’

Realized quickly that I could do kratom only with a six hour window between doses...or I would get a headache. A HORRIBLE headache.

Over the past two years I began dosing \~7grams every 6 hours.

Understood that the only way to experience kratom’s god given effects was total immersion. NOT the extremely temporary ‘high’ from individual doses.

And I still understand this.

Started to feel that I was feeling down in hours 4 through 6 between doses.

So, I started taking a dose \~ every 41/2 hours.

Then I realized that I needed more between the 41/2 hour doses or I would get jittery.

Decided to ‘push back’ a bit to see where I was.

Stopped dosing for \~ 12 hours.

HOLY SHIT did I feel horrible. Progressively horrible towards the 12th hour.

So I went back to dose. Every 4 hours or so plus I needed more grams to compensate.

Realized pretty quick I had an unexpected problem; I was addicted.

Up until that moment, when I knew I was physically addicted, I laughed at those who said they were addicted. Just didn’t think it could be.

Thought people were weak or whining if they complained about withdrawal.

Pushed back a few more times and realized I was completely helpless.

ZOOMED with my physician.

He had no experience with patients who wanted to quit kratom.

To his credit he quickly read the info he had available. I heard him say, ‘So kratom is an opioid and a stimulant.’

He immediately prescribed *tramadol*.

I’m sitting here now a month and a half out and I am still feeling blah to outright shitty every single moment of every single day. But that’s a welcomed improvement.

The first 3 or 4 days I stopped taking kratom I guess I was experiencing physical *and* psychological withdrawal.

I don’t know much because the first week I was taking a decreasing prescription of the opioid *tramadol* to help steady me.

The **physical withdrawals are hard.**

The **psychological withdrawal is straight-up hell.**

And I mean, a whole new kind of hell for me on this earth.

This scrib is already way too long but I need to caution everyone, the psychological hell that I experienced was CONSTANT aggravation, rolling rides of unexpected terror, and a physical irritation that is just too hard to describe.

The withdrawal symptoms actually progressively increased over the next three weeks.

There were points where, if the state of my being would have been an inescapable constant, there is absolutely NO hesitation, I would have killed myself. Just, not even a question.

Sleep is stolen. To this day.

I will never put myself through that again.

If I take kratom again I will just go with it for the remainder of my life.

**Withdrawal from kratom is bad. But it’s actually way worse than you can imagine.**

In a flawed visual metaphor I feed myself I imagine gentle puff balls of serotonin being dropped from my ceiling that occasionally fall into imaginary open flowers that represent neurotransmitters.

Taking kratom increases the production of the gentle puff balls that fall from my ceiling to the point where my body would stop producing them or greatly slow the production.

In addition, many of the numerous ‘flowers’ growing up from my floor would close because they weren’t needed. Too much serotonin coming down : )

The relationship between the puff balls and the flowers, the serotonin and the neurotransmitters, is a rewards type of thermostat for our bodies. If we naturally do something good or needed for our bodies we are given a body generated reward. Letting us know that we are doing the right thing.

A little shot of reward. A little shot of serotonin.

Of course kratom, along with many other drugs, can temporarily hijack this system.

So, IF we are addicted to kratom, or something like kratom, we are left with a significantly reduced production of serotonin. Plus we have fewer flowers that are open; fewer neurotransmitters that are actually working.

Peace, a sense of energetic calm, virtually everything that we ingest kratom to obtain, we are not only unable to experience during withdrawal but we are forced to live the exact opposite of those feelings & emotions.

It’s terrifying, irritating, aggravating all at the same time and it’s amplified and actually more real than having these emotions being triggered from an outside source.

If I am hot I can move or change the temperature of my surroundings.

When the irritation comes from within it is more real, more intense, and more overwhelming than experiencing irritation from an outside source.

I realize that I deeply damaged my entire serotonin system and it’s going to take a long time to reset and repair. I pray that it will.

Yet I am all too aware that whatever we think, pray, or know has no bearing here in a recovery.",42

The previous time i was off it lasted about two months. I then made the stupid mistake of getting back on it. First use was to cure a hangover and of course it snowballed back to the same dosage as before, around 15 GPD for about 4 months now. 

24 hours since last dose now (CT). I hope I have the strength to go through the initial WD:s yet again. The hardest part is probably not to stop dosing initialy, but rather to stay away and sober forever. Wish me luck brothers and sisters.  
Much love to this forum.",4
2020-12-11 16:07:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/kbbdcb/scared_again/,Scared again,"Hey guys. I posted in this group exactly a year ago that I wanted to stop but was afraid. I chickened out at the 24 hour mark and I have been using non stop since. I’m so sick of it. I get no good feelings from it anymore and I feel like it’s taken away every good feeling in life in general. I would not kill myself but I find myself wishing for death most hours of most days. I’m not interested in anything I used to like anymore, and I have really bad anxiety everyday. I have to rip the bandaid off. I don’t have a high GPD like most users here, but my current schedule looks like 7am - 2 grams, 10am - 2 grams, 3pm 6-grams, and then I go home from work and I take handfuls until I inevitably get wobbly. I got really bad wobbles earlier in the week that really scared me, I couldn’t see and everything was shaky. 

Today I have already cut back, by taking 1.5 instead of 2 at 7 and 10. I’m going to keep my afternoon dosing to 1.5 as well and try to go to bed early tonight. This addiction is my biggest secret. The only person that knows about it is my guy at the head shop. I want to talk about it but I can’t bring myself to tell people in my real life that I’m addicted to something again. 

Anyways, this is a word vomit of all my thoughts surrounding this. I’m happy that I get to share this here.",10

Not good, but i'm hanging in there. Eventually I will have no choice when I run out. And I WILL NOT go to a smoke shop and spend $30 for 20 grams.

But anyway, I keep wondering to myself - how many people have REALLY OD'd and DIED on Kratom? Yeah, I've heard about alleged Kratom Deaths/suicides and was always skeptical. Now I'm starting to wonder if someone like that was actually experiencing WDs from trying to quit.....thoughts? (And still had Kratom in their system when they died, of course.)

I am quite certain that the only ""OD-ing"" i could do on Kratom would simply cause me to get sick. I certainly wouldn't drift away like a heroin OD.

Right?

Again, don't get me wrong. I'm not trying to say ""Stay on Kratom it's better for you."" I'm saying WDs are much more dangerous. That's why it's so important to find ways to cope and it's also why I can't knock anyone for going to rehab for extra guidance and help.",3

I’m considering starting some reasonable supplements like l-tyrosine and magnesium to sorta build up in my system bc it’s possible I jump right after Xmas.

Yesterday was not very pleasant,  bad headache, body aches, lethargy and very low mood.  I went to bed last night at 5pm not expecting to sleep very well, but rest felt good.  I was amazed that I had 12 hrs of good sleep, with no restless legs and only one episode of sweating.  This morning I woke up with no headache and feeling rested and feeling pretty good.  The black cloud has lifted and it feels pretty much like a normal day before kratom.  I really can't believe it.  I was so scared to CT I didn't have the nerve to try.  This was really pretty easy considering my amount  and time I used.  I am singing my praises this morning.  I just want you all to know that we are all different and you may be lucky like me and not have it too bad.  I did use some of the recommended supplements, the most helpful was DLPA and magnesium.

Got a little tub from a supplement store near my house. I take 2-3 grams of it at a time, which is gonna make you piss out your ass. So I grabbed some Imodium to help with that (take as directly) some people will take a shitload of it to relieve opiate withdrawals and that's extremely dangerous for your heart and will kill you. I also went to my doc and complained about not being able to sleep (didnt want her to think ""oh hes already an addict I cant give him more addictive things). Ended up getting a prescription for Wellbutrin. Hoping that will pull my mood up, as that was the reason I was using kratom in the first place. Second is 30 pills of 1mg Lorazepam. This shit is HIGHLY addictive as any Benzodiazepine is, but I am not using it to abuse it. I only use it to relieve the anxiety of k withdrawal. I am def taking more than directed, but not exceeding 4mg/day. I will stop this probably 2 days from now when acutes start to fuck off. Anyways, I think the most helpful is the vitamin C at those high doses. Apparently it interacts with opiate receptors in your brain and mimics an actual opiate being there without the addiction garbage. I think the vitamin C helps with RLS as i havent had much of that. Honestly I just feel like I have a mild cold. Would probably be much worse if I wasnt taking care of myself with the above tools \^.",9

2020-12-10 12:38:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/kajuyr/followup_on_a_big_mistake_post/,"Followup On ""A Big Mistake"" Post","It's been 10 days since I made a very controversial post on this sub about my addiction to kratom and suicide. I would like to provide an update to anybody who is concerned or wants to hear a hopeful story in their time of need.

Without getting into too much detail, I did end up making a very big mistake which sent me to the ER. The reason why is because kratom ruined many aspects of my life and exacerbated my depression/anxiety. I am sure some of you can relate but I lost my GF of 3 years, my job, my scholarship, my interest in my favorite hobbies, and many other aspects of my life that I cherished before I became addicted to kratom. I did feel like I had nothing else to lose at the time which is why I made such a rash decision. This may not be much of a big surprise to anybody reading this but yes, I survived. It was thanks to my wonderful friends who were able to save my life and call for help. 

At the ER, I was treated for my urgent condition and was stabilized. I told the nurses and the social workers there that I made a big mistake because of my addiction to kratom and depression. After a dozen hours of hanging out in my room, eating, talking to family, and recovering, I was transferred to a psychiatric hospital. Withdrawals were kicking in by then but I had no other choice but to trust the process. Luckily I was admitted within 3 hours and given a place to sleep with a freshly made bed. Unfortunately it was the middle of the night so I did not have enough energy to get out of bed in the morning and eat breakfast or lunch thanks to the withdrawals. 

Then things changed for the better. I was able to see my psychiatrist and talk about all my concerns with him so he could help. He ended up giving me Suboxone/Naloxone for the kratom addiction and Wellbutrin for my depression. As soon as the medications were administered to me, I felt much better than before. I was not high, I was just... happy. Instead of sitting around and zoning out, I genuinely wanted to do things and help myself get better by making the most out of my hospital stay. I participated in all the group therapies, exercised, ate more food, drank more water, asked more questions/advice, and socialized with as many people in my unit as I could. Despite few inconveniences such as the cold temperature, the subpar food, dirty rooms, and some bad social workers, I did enjoy the time I spent there. I learned a lot of new things such as coping mechanisms, facts about depression, and even facts about myself. I made a couple of new friends there too who I still keep in contact with today. So much changed in my perception of life, and it had only been 7 days until I was finally discharged. 

Now I am back at home adjusting to the real world. I am 10 days free from kratom and I am taking half of the dose of Suboxone/Naloxone that I have started with. I will admit, at times it has not been easy. My family is still emotionally shaken up as I have been. Sometimes I feel very sad for a few hours and then I feel much better. Because of this, I have also thrown away my juul and alcohol and decided to stay completely sober during this process. Even caffeine is a big no for me. Instead, I have found that starting new, healthy habits and having something to look forward to helps a lot. Exercise, meditation, learning a new skill, etc. are all great examples. That being said, PAWS can kiss my ass. For anybody who thinks that depression is the root cause of their addiction, I recommend reading Feeling Good by David D. Burns M.D.. That book alone is so helpful that a scientific study showed that reading it was able to help patients with depression significantly better than antidepressants or placebos. If anybody needs advice on starting new habits or coping mechanisms, please let me know in the comments.

Anyway, I start PHP soon and will be doing it for the next few weeks as part of my recovery. If you are reading this and are having serious trouble with kratom addiction, I highly recommend that you avoid the path that I took as I did it out of sheer desperation and stupidity. There are plenty of ways to get help for your situation like going to your doctor or even going to a facility for drug addiction. There are plenty of resources at your disposal and only you know what you require. Do not try and strongarm your way through this alone as getting help from loved ones and professionals is perfectly acceptable and is the most mature/brave decision you can make. If you have any questions, please comment below. I wish you all the best of luck. If I can do this, you can do it too!",5

I decided to do about 50 grams from November the 26th to the 28th which unfortunately threw me right back into minor acutes.

Today is day 11 of getting over those acutes and it definitely hasn’t been easy. Sleep is still mega jacked up and I sleep abt 4 hrs a night but at least the night sweats have kinda subsided. Today was a major win because I am (gross warning) taking semi solid bowel movement’s. The stomach stuff and diarrhea is one of my least favorite kratom withdrawal symptoms.

Ive made an attempt to quit about a year ago, and failed. The dependence was nowhere as bad then as it is now. For those familiar, ive been only taking those extract shots, about 3 a day. i dont know how much mitragynine is in those, but its a lot. the bottle directs never to take more than one third of a bottle in a day. when i dont have any, my lower back feels clamped by something hot. my stomach feels achy and hot. the worst is the dopamine deficiency. im extremely passionate for science, so maybe i can better explain it this way. when i tried to quit before, it was the physical part that scared me. it was always the physical part. But now i have no dopamine and far too much reinforced u receptors in my body that i fear will take ages to break down. i wanted to go to the gym, because i wanted to take advantage of my endorphins to shave away some wd, but i wonder if my body will go back to normal as quick as possible if im still activating my opioid receptors like that so much. i like science, but im no scientist or doctor. if any of this is incorrect, please correct me. nothing has any joy in it that i can find. im told to distract myself but its tough because everything is boring and its hard not to think about. thats the worst part. its not normal boredom, its a desperation to find something that can squeeze out whatever dopamine is left in there. this boredom is not normal its torturous, it will be a while to not have to depend on kratom to make my hobbies fun again. this sub is so helpful and its good to see im not alone here. although, it of course is not a good thing that this many people have fallen into this trap. i think this shit should be illegal.",6

Not in soberville I need to learn to face it and work through it. A tough road to sled for me. 

Feel good this morning if not a bit demotivated because the work I have to do is less than enjoyable and the upcoming holidays has me being an ultra procrastinator. 

Hanging in though. Another clean day behind me and the promise of a sober future still in tact. Stay strong everyone!",13

I can't  believe six months have passed.  I wanted to post on day 180 but it passed without even me realizing because things are busy right now.  I no longer feel any PAWs from K.  I am also addicted to nicotine and I tried quitting that about 50 days ago. After a month and a half off nicotine, I was feeling lethargic and depressed, so I took some nicorette and it went away.  I did it as a test to see if my doldrums were from K related Paws or nicotine and discovered  it is from nicotine.   Feels so good to know I am not controlled by K anymore!!!  I am so grateful for this community that kept me going when K Paws were hitting hard.  I am never going back to K again.  I started like many others who were to told it was just like caffeine.  Hah!   Stay strong everyone.  For those going through withdrawals,  enbrace the suck and keep the faith that there is light at the end of the tunnel.  Everyone is different and it took me a long time to get out of the mental residual effects of anhedonia and lethargy.  But it did finally happen.  I am now going to go back to kicking nicotine. Feel bad that I went back on nicotine for a week,  but it was a good experiment to understand whether K was still having any lingering effects.  K was so hard to get over because it has such a long recovery period. I will still stay vigilant against this green demon.",14

I went off it, because I was working towards going off all meds. I stopped taking it in April. Yes, anxiety and pain got worse -- but also quarentine would cause that too. I was given Kratom, in August, as a stimulant by my husband- not really knowing what it was, but wanting to get off coffee. Well, I'm a recovering alcoholic and opiate user - clean 14 years. The kratom gave me back the relief I was missing from Gaba, and I have taken it every day since he gave it to me. After 10 years, we broke up the next day-- and its been difficult, and Kratom helped me navigate the anxiety and depression which was now off the charts. But I get the sweats and chills every 4-5 hours without kratom.
 I had been 12 to 15 gpd
I have worked my way down to 6-7 gpd. But now I'm working to get off completely...Its just so hard to commit to when, I feel like I need it to stay sharp, and a step ahead of my vindictive ex, and also not get sick.
SO- my doc put me back on gaba, 300mgpd 2x a day, so small dose. Should I take it now, with the intention of helping a taper? Or should I wait until I am ready to CT?

So what happened was I am a microdoser, once in a while I will take a small amount of mushrooms, this day was 150mg.  In the night when I take my dose, I just didn't want it, I just put it away and didn't, the smell was bad, the taste, everything was bad, I initially began my toss and wash and just spit it out. A few days went by and I decided to give it another try, so I took a smaller dose than I am used to and it went ok so I started to use daily again, bit I would always get an anxiety type tightness in my chest. I didn't think anything of it because it would pass. I would look at myself in the mirror and just see blotchy skin, and I didn't look good, so anyway the last time I took my dose all was good, it actually hit me a bit more than normal, I was beginning to get the spins so I went to lay down, I almost fell asleep when the pain came back, my heart began to race, and I just started to feel weak, this was roughly 2.5 hours post consumption. My body just felt like shit and my heart was pounding, I then told myself, every thing is going to be ok, it's just anxiety, I need to just relax. As I began to try to relax I began to slowly calm but out of nowhere my heart felt like it started to just do some weird shit,  I shot out of my bed and got so dizzy I thought I was going to pass out. It was absolutely scary. I don't know what the hell happened but I stopped taking kratom that day, I dumped everything I had left and will never touch the stuff again. I get it now.

I'm getting more and more depressed and it's a very expensive habit. I also can barely lift any weight when I go to the gym. 

I'm not very good at tapering down so I'm considering just cold turkey this and be good for 2021 next month.

I have some comfort meds like clonidine and gabapentin but wasn't too successful using those when I tried to quit last week.  

Any advice on this? I could taper down to one a day then one every other day... That would be hard. I wish I could go under anesthesia with propofol and wake up in two weeks, after the physical withdrawal is better!  (Addict dream lol).  Looking forward to chatting with some of you all about this kratom demon and support each other with the quit.  

Oh yeah, I've also heard some people recommending powder and then tapering that way, I'd rather not order anymore kratom but if it's worth it and will help me wean off this better, maybe I should consider.  Thanks",5

Took a 4 gram dose 70 days in. By day 70 I felt terrific, didn’t even crave the shit. So I figured heck let’s get a dose from my friend and enjoy my Friday night. 

The purpose of this post is to let y’all know that kratom literally isn’t even that fun. First dose after 70 days I expected to be so amazing. I knew I’d only take a dose, and my friend knew to hold me to that. I was so excited. 

It sucked. I laid in bed feeling decent at best, then quickly fell asleep. 

I woke up the next day with this realization.... when you’re sober and no longer withdrawing, normal life is more fun than the hour of bliss that kratom gives you. I expected that “treat” to be a kiss from god. I romanticized it. And it let me down.

I thank god it let me down. Kratom isn’t as good as you think it is, youre just addicted. 

So when you reach day 70 (and you will), don’t make my mistake and take a dose. Because the dose won’t even be that great. Literally not worth it. 

Anyway I’m on day 92 or something with that one on my score card. No big deal. I’m still healthy, sober, and got to see that kratom isn’t as cool as our brain makes it out to be. Sobriety is 100% more fun.

I was young, I did drugs like they were going out of style. I heard about Suboxone and thought, wow!! A miracle drug!! After about 12 years of taking that I decide to quit after tapering down to what I consider a pointless amount to even take. I was cutting one 4mg strip into I think 32 separate pieces and taking only one in the morning. I quit cold turkey thinking that it wasn’t gonna be bad since I was taking such a low dose for at least 2 years. When I did pull the trigger and actually stop taking my daily dose, it took about a full day for me to go into full blown withdrawal. Sooooo, after about 4 days of miserable withdrawal I decide to look for herbal supplements to help with the pain and all around discomfort. I stumble upon kratom. First time I took it, it was a godsend. Immediately stopped all withdrawal, so without hesitation, I decide to take it daily, multiple times a day. I wasn’t weighing it in the beginning, but if I had to guess, I was taking probably 5-7 grams 3 times a day for a good solid 2 years. I decide to try and slow down so I got a little capsule maker and weighed the packed capsule, 1/2 gram. The capsule maker makes 24 each time you do it, so then I started taking 24 capsules in a 24 hour period. I took that amount for about 1 year. THEN, being in my line of work, I have to travel from time to time. It’s annoying as hell making up the capsules so I started taking half, which would be 12 capsules a day, equaling 6 grams. I’d been working in Arkansas for about 6 months and was traveling to and from Louisiana on the weekends because of the 3 day weekends we had. One night I had to work late, decided that I’d rather get a speeding ticket and get home faster than drive 8 hours, and ended up getting pulled over. I knew everything in my car was good, but I told him no to the search because I was in a hurry, it was late, and I was tired. He was a K-9 cop so he was able to take the dog around my car anyway. He claimed that he “hit” on my car so he then had the right to search. I had a shoebox in the front floorboard with all my stuff in it. Two 250 gram containers about 1/3 full and one 250 gram container unopened. He found that and didn’t even know what it was. He had to ask me, I was honest because I didn’t think it was illegal, he looked it up, and lucky me got to get arrested and charged with drug trafficking, possession, and packing repacking and manufacturing. I got out on bond a couple days later and immediately took some very old kratom that I’d had for about a year. It doesn’t work well at all and I start getting horrible stomach cramps and anxiety and other things. Arrested on Thursday driving home, in jail, get home on Saturday, drive back to Arkansas on Sunday. All I took was about 6 grams of that old stuff Sunday morning before my drive. I slept and woke up for work the next morning. I thought I had covid. Couldn’t stand up straight because my stomach was cramping and hurting so bad. I immediately make the 8 hour drive back home. I felt horrible. My wife who is now 6 months pregnant with our first child, tells me that I’m withdrawing. She goes to the local head shop and buys some,I take it and immediately I feel better. I’m now taking 6-8 capsules (3-4 grams) in the morning. I’m trying to quit but so scared that I’m gonna have to relive that hell. So I’m going through legal trouble and am facing 15-40 years and my final court date is 1 day before the due date of my first child. Sometimes I feel like I’m withdrawing even after taking the 6-8 capsules in the morning. I’m terrified about quitting and terrified about going to jail for something legal in 46 states that I honestly didn’t know was illegal there, otherwise the box would have been hidden, AT THE VERY LEAST! so I didn’t take any this morning but I screwed up and substituted. So I’m not hurting today, but mentally freaking out. Also, I’ve been out of a job ever since my boss found out about my pending charges, which has now been around 5 months. So I can sit at home and go through withdrawal, but am terrified because I know what they feel like. My anxiety level is through the roof.

I have been using Kratom for about 5 years (30-50gpd). I've been trying to stop/taper for a few years, to no avail. Got down to 3mg a few years ago, but for some reason I didn't make the jump. Just decided to stop 3 days ago because I don't want to still be taking it when I turn 40. I've been jumping from one thing to another since I was about 13/14, was able to kick dope and benzos with one (of many rehabs) I was totally clean for 5 years, when I needed shoulder surgery in 2015. Took oxy for a few months, then decided to try kratom since I could feel that habit creeping back. It was great, and I didn't really think it was so bad. I should have known better given my experience- probably just denial. My husband doesn't understand addiction. He thinks addicts are just weak, and they should try living in N. Korea to see what ""difficult"" is. He didn't know that I had an issue with K. I always said it was just a supplement for my joint pain- I was a strength coach and competitive power lifter for 7+ years, so he knows I've had a ton of injuries (in addition to some car wrecks and a 30ft. fall where I was incapacitated for a year and a half.) He didn't ask me to quit, but I know he wants me to. More importantly, I want to so desperately. I don't feel human anymore, and I miss how great I felt those years I was sober. I tried to explain that I might not be able to do much to contribute for a few days-weeks. By yesterday he was already over it. I know I'm doing the right thing for myself and for us, but I feel super guilty. I keep thinking I should just take a small dose to at least clean the house and do all the shit I should have done before starting. It's just so cold, so I don't want to get out of bed even though I know moving around will help. I can't eat or sleep, but I can type today.  I'm worried I picked a bad time to quit, but I HAVE TO. I don't know how to explain it to him, and tapering isn't a good option for me.",8

First two weeks:  Pure hell, anxiety, insomnia, RLS, debilitating stomach cramps.

Next 3 months:  Very depressed and fatigued.  Considering ending my life more than once. PAWS has set in with a vengeance.  I started taking an SSRI and got a script for serax (mild benzo).

I know I have been taking way more than 50 to 60 grams a day prior to this. I never measured but I finally towards the end began to measure with a 4g spoon and it wasnt even comparable to the amount I was doing. I guess my point of this is to say that my WD symptoms have been so minimal. I'm truly shocked. I've come off heroin and every other thing you could think of. This is barely anything. Sneezing anxiety and that's about it. When i started kratom 8 months ago I was in recovery and I have a 12 step program. I have a Higher Power. I have taken off 5 days from work. Today is day 5. There just is no reasonable explanation why my wd symptoms haven't been horrible. I'm extremely grateful for it. I'm super grateful for y'all as well. And I have been taking gabapentin. I take trazadone at night and black seed oil. I work out every morning and stay busy with my 3 nephews during the day. Tonight I go back to my sober living house and I'm just concerned the wd are going to hit later. Is this a thing???,5

Wanted to say hello...been lurking on this sub for a few days now. A daily user (about 3gms 6-8 times a day) since 2006, I decided it's about time to ditch the doom-sludge and am on day 3 of CT :D

This is the first time I have attempted to quit kratom and don't want to be a quitter flip-flopper. I did, however, quit Mirtazapine CT earlier in the summer (had been a user of that for 3.5 years). That wasn't very pleasant but all WD symptoms from that went after the 10 day mark. So far, my kratom WD symptoms have been rather similar to coming off the Mirtazapine....both kratom and Mirt are acetylcholine agonists and I wonder if that reflects the WD symptoms? my desire to smoke nicotine has massively decreased in the last couple of days too and I believe there is a relationship between nicotine and acetylcholine?

Day 1 I spent tidying the house like mad - the distraction was good but the RLS and insomnia at night were awful. I was worried I was waking up my partner so ended up sleeping on the couch. Day 2 (yesterday), felt very anxious in the morning and EXHAUSTED all day with massive brain fog. Had an over the counter (non prescription) lightweight sleeping tablet last night and rubbed heatrub on my limbs before bed - no RLS at all and slept much better but not great. Day 3, today, (currently 12.30pm in my location), feel like 'body flu', tired and grumpy but no desire for kratom, just want to ride it out.

I do expect the kratom WD symptoms to last longer than 10 days but seriously hoping it's not going to take multiple months like some of the horror stories. On the Mirtazapine quitting forums some folks were reporting stories of feeling like shit 6 months into quitting...I do fear reading too many posts like that can be a predictive programming exercise!

I do smoke weed and have methylphenidate for ADHD which will obviously give my symptoms somewhat more of a 'cushioning' compared to others on here. I have decided to 'half' my daily quota of weed and meds for this week...waiting longer for a spliff gives me something to look forward to and Ritalin and body flu aren't a fun mix! I was tempted to completely ditch my ADHD meds for this week but since I'm prescribed them for genuinely low dopamine levels I thought it would be daft to cut them out fully.

 I'm also doing something a bit controversial but something I am familiar and quite well researched in - microdosing psilocybin...I did it a couple of years ago for 1 month and was remarkable for my depression. At no time during the month did I have any 'trippyness' and had no desire to carry on MDing after the month was up. My reasons for doing this is how microdosing affects the brains 'default mode network' - something that I know my kratom addiction is intrinsically tied to.

Also I'm keeping a journal and doing light exercise. I actually started a gentle morning exercise regime a month ago (before my first dose of the days kratom), I think setting up that routine before quitting is a heck of a good call as it's not tempting to start exercising whilst withdrawing! 

I'm hoping to update this thread as my CT journey continues...I realise I've been taking the stuff for a long time so it won't be easy but hope it can inspire others who are wanting to quit :)

Much love!",19

Even though I’m approaching day 13 CT in an hour, I already do feel like I am in the throes of PAWS. 

What I am noticing about PAWS is how it does truly come in waves. I can go from a functioning person to a deeply depressed, nearly-dead feeling in a damn instant. I never know when I’ll come out of it, but I have noticed I am developing coping methods with riding the waves. 

First I address the feeling and label it. If I don’t do this, anxiety will tell me that something is wrong with me. That makes the symptoms worse, of course.

From here, I try to stay cognizant of what is going on inside of my head, usually paired with breathing + music.

I was wondering if anyone could tell me if the success they have had tapering.  I have gotten many mixed reviews.  I was up to about 5 gold pills daily for say the last 45 day, but have been taking Kratom on and off for probably a year or so.  

I have a schedule I’m following and my wife is assisting, but it’s a 23 day taper.  Wondering td that’s too aggressive or not.

I was addicted to kratom for 3 years and today marks day 4 sludge free:) my addiction consisted of 3 horrific 9-10 month periods of daily use separated by a few months of sobriety.
 I first started using during my senior year of high school. I turned 18 and was finally able to go into the main smoke shop in my town. They had a bunch of legal “highs” for sale, but I eventually settled on Kratom as it worked wonders for my depression and gave me so much energy! The first year I used it, I genuinely think it helped me. I took it only 1-2 times daily, about 8 gpd, and it really didn’t cause me any negative side effects. I eventually went off to college and brought a bunch with me. I used it sparingly but I eventually ran out. Kratom is illegal in the state I go to college so I decided to quit. The withdrawals were very mild and only lasted about 1-2 days and then I was good as new! 
Eventually the year ended and I found myself back in a legal kratom state.  I had enjoyed about 3 months of sobriety, but I immediately began using when I got home. This time I found that my previous 1-2 doses per day wasn’t cutting it so I quickly moved up to 3-4 doses a day or roughly 15-20 gpd. This continued for another 8 months because I prepared and brought 2 kilos when I went back to school. My 20 gpd, gradually evolved into a 40-50 gpd habit. I ran out with a few months left in the year and suffered bad withdrawals. 4-5 days of absolute hell.  I used adderal for a few days to combat the lethargy and depression. (Big mistake)This would relieve my symptoms during the day but nights were HORRIBLE. I didn’t sleep for 4 days and I thought I was going crazy, but on day 5 I finally crashed and slept for like 12 hours and felt much better after that. The withdrawals were much worst than the first time, but still not enough for me to learn my lesson I guess lol. 
After that period I stayed sober for about 2 months and I was feeling great! But due to COVID, my school sent all students home early so when I got home I quickly started using again. Within 2 weeks I was up to 50-60 gpd. This continued for about 8 months until 4 days ago! I knew I had to quit when I was throwing up 1-2 times per week from dosing, waking up in the middle of the night just to dose, and watching my bank account drain week after week. I was constantly thinking and worrying about kratom and I didn’t even realize I was pulling away from all my friends and family. I would constantly skip hang outs with my friends just to dose and lay around doing nothing. Kratom had taken my life from me and I had enough. I did a rapid taper (about 3 days) cutting my doses in half each day. This was giving me bad withdrawals already so I decided to just stop completely. 
Day 1 I stocked up on supplements. I read that loperamide is helpful so I took about 20 mg of that and I felt much better but it didn’t feel cleansing so I didn’t take it all after the first day. I found ashwaghanda, magnesium, ginseng, and cannabis
 to be the most efficient combo for managing symptoms. During the first 3 days I felt like absolute hell. Everything peaked on days 2-3. The worst symptoms for me were body pains, anxiety, depression, and brain fog. The supplements definitely help! They don’t magically cure everything but they do work wonders for your body’s recovery and I believe they help speed up the healing process! The insomnia was also awful, but I found taking magnesium, edible cannabis (if it’s your thing), and a hot epsom salt bath for at least 20 minutes allowed me to get roughly 2-4 hours of sleep per night for the first few days. I know cannabis gives some people bad anxiety, but I live in a legal state and am a daily cannabis user so it does nothing but make me feel great. If it’s your thing I would highly reccomend it, but if not than you certainly don’t need it.  I also found that taking a 30 second freezing cold shower and then shifting it back to hot gives an immediate, but short lasting rush of energy. I think the science behind it is that the drastic change in temp shocks your body and releases all kinds of beneficial endorphins and chemicals into your bloodstream. I heard someone else on this forum describe it well: if your feeling sad or stressed about something, but suddenly something worse happens, you no longer care about the first thing. I’m totally misquoting that person, but that was the general idea. 
Today is day 4 and I’m feeling slightly better! The bad symptoms still come in waves but I also had periods of feeling good! I managed to go for a 20 minute run. It was hell but I did feel much better after that! It’s tough but I would strongly encourage some kind of excercise during WD. A good and easy one I found is a walk in the woods! It gets my heart up a little bit, and I know this may sounds crazy but I swear being surrounded by trees, nature, and fresh air does contribute greatly to a successful recovery! It’s hard to explain but I feel a noticeable healing energy while immersed in nature.  Positive thinking about the future also helped me greatly in managing my anxiety. Whenever cravings to use would come up I would sit and think about how close I am to a clean life and I found this to help calm me down. I still feel like shit as I’m typing this but I know I am through the worst of it. I also know I can never go back. The weird thing is, I don’t have any resentment toward Kratom. It really did help me a lot in the beginning and I think it would be valuable to study its compounds for medicinal use in controlled settings, but as far as recreational use is concerned, it’s no longer for me. 
I hope my experience can offer any form of wisdom or support to anyone trying to quit or in the process of quitting. 2 weeks ago I never thought I would be kratom free, but now I’m  4 days without it and I know I can soon return to my normal life. I wish everyone out here hoping to quit the best of luck. It’s hard as hell but for sure possible for anyone. The biggest piece of advice I can give is to become your own best friend. You are all some damn warriors for even thinking about quitting, so remember that you are strong and just be loving and patient with yourself.",9

I‘ve been on kratom for almost 2 years now taking 30 gpd in average. Within 2 weeks I tapered down to 5 gpd (no scheme, reduced how much I felt like was gonna be possible).
I started having bad sleep at around 10 gpd (4-5 hpd) and today I had a total mental breakdown and severe! depression. I did meth and kratom the whole summer and quit meth in August for good, but Kratom stayed as a loyal companion. Then I lost my job, made more and more debt due to the ongoing expensis for Kratom, which finally let me to the decision to quit Kratom as well. The first days of tapering worked pretty wel l, bc I changed the strain and took supplements (black seed oil etc.) 
I think the sleep deprivation made it a lot worse for me. 
I am going back to 15 gpd and will be seeking medical help (psychologist advice and so on). It feels like a capitulation, but I see no other way without putting me in harm.
I wish you guys the best luck on your way, but things like these can happen, so be prepared for it, also most people probably won‘t encounter these kind of setbacks.",3

I want to quit the valium too but I am having anxiety and my TMJ is hurting.  I haven’t had any valium in 8 days.  Trying to stay strong but feeling rough.  I can refill my valium on Thursday.  Feeling sad sucks. Feeling like a loser sucks.  Feeling like I have wasted most of my life sucks. Feeling like I don’t know what I am doing sucks.  I think this is more related to the valium than the Kratom at this point.,3

Those wd were tough and lasted 4-5 days rough and then hazy for another 3-4, and then I literally forgot about Kratom and had a amazing trip of bliss. Before that I was taking 12-15gpd and at one point I was as high as 25-30. Jumping back to now Stable at 5-9 grams for several months I decided enough, I wanted freedom. So I stopped. Period. Done. Ice Cold shower in the am, ran 3 miles, breathwork, 1-2xdsily hot yoga, meditation, Good healthy food and a daily carrot beet celery juice. I started writing down all my biggest dreams in life with no limitation. What excited me most. I tasted inspiration, I'm excited to live w no shackles. I didn't want to go through the week long wd I experienced in Australia so I got a little chemical help. Gabapentin @ 300mg morning and evening. Total 600mg. Now on my forth day no physical wd a few simple psych cravings first 1-3 days but for the first time in ages I barely even think about it now on day 4. I'll start tapering from 600mg to 300 on day 5 or 6 and then 150 for a few days and done. I can't believe how well gaba works. 🙏 I was so sick of the yo yo life if Kratom and living in a secret addiction. Food, exercise, Abraham Hicks, hot n cold treatment is the recipe I believe that works unless you have some underlaying psych issues. You have to put your body and mind through a higher extreme it was able to go through on Kratom. You have to find a deeper hell then the fleeting glimpses of heaven Kratom gave you. Ice water Bath, extreme hot yoga, and insane cardio running. You have to one up the Kratom bliss with self endured savagery. Agony...but on my terms..not laying in a bed craving Kratom feeling restless and dopesick! After and ice bath and a 3 mile run today I can honestly say day in 4 I have never felt such peace and pure excitement for the future. I hope this inspires one person.",7

I’ve quit four successful times. Meaning more than a week but this time is surprisingly the easiest. Obviously the Valium+Gabapentin I took the first two nights were game changers. I’ll be continuing Gabapentin at night for the next three or four days before quitting those. Also taking a TON of supplements. Magnesium, 5 htp, choline, vitamin c and a few other cocktail mixes. I can’t stress enough the importance of cardio. Intense cardio. Cardio that makes you want to die. I’m running or hiking for at least 4 hours a day. I decided I was going to whip myself in shape the 6 months prior to quitting and boy am I glad I did. It made it so much easier to exercise now. I can’t imagine starting at day one during withdrawal. 
I know that the body aches restless legs and insomnia will end soon and the days will get better. But what I’ve been wrestling with currently is letting go of the good times on this drug. Which stupidly were only 2 percent of the time. This drug made me miserable 98% of the uses. But man, snuggling up with your woman, getting emotionally intimate and feeling those intense feelings of love. That hard to explain feeling.. I’m terrified to let that go.

Just wanted to check in and share something that has been helping me on my journey to quit Kratom. I used Kratom for 10 years and took around 8-12gpd. Because of the length of my addiction, I decided to start tapering in mid October (after a hellish CT experience) with the goal to quit by the new year. I am currently at 2.5gpd which is huge progress for me!! The taper drops have been hard, especially the last few, but I've been pushing myself in part by motivating myself with the money I will be saving. 

Specifically, I calculated how much money I spend on Kratom a year and decided that, as a reward and as a form of accountability for quitting, I'm going to spend some of that money next year on a hobby/interest/trip that really speaks to me. In my case, I've wanted a pet boa constrictor since I was a kid, so this is going to be my recovery/accountability gift. I know it's hard to find interest in things after heavy Kratom use, but if you can find something that really drives you that you can't afford financially, figure out how much you'll save by quitting Kratom and then do it!! I'm hoping that if I ever get an urge to buy Kratom again, I'll just think, 'nope, I've already spent that money!'

Of course the risk would be spending that money and then also relapsing and buying more Kratom. Does anyone else have success (or failure) with this strategy?  

Thanks and good luck to you all! We can do this!",11

But to pull this off and be on my a-game for my daughter. Full of confidence.  And ill start dead broke. I can't afford kratom. And im sick of it. I want to be sober again. I want to be the best mom i can which begins taking of myself.

I was 10-20gpd for 4 years. Also an almost daily heavy alcohol drinker. 

I have to say, cutting out alcohol was by far the biggest difference maker in my efforts to quit. Now that I don't have the lingering anxiety of an alcoholic, I can manage the anxiety from being off kratom.

For any of you like me that were combo kratom all day, drink at night that are struggling to quit, I would recommend starting with alcohol. Cutting out the harsher drug first seems like a good step. 

Idk how much I even believe in PAWS like this subreddit seems to. I believe I have mental health issues, which are becoming more clear post use. I don't see it as lingering symptoms of kratom use, but as long term symptoms of anxiety and depression that I had masked for 4 years. I think it's helpful not to continue blaming kratom, but to take every day as it comes, and move forward.

That being said, I feel better day to day then I did while using. The biggest relief I feel is being able to leave my apartment without thinking. As long as I have my keys I don't worry about where I'm gonna go. 

Hoping to get through this holiday sober. It'll be tough with a family full of alcoholics, bit I think I can manage. 

Thanks for the support everyone. Seeing everyone working hard to feel better here helps me get through my tough days.",11

Those notes felt like a Hail Mary attempt to get some confidence at the time, as I was incredibly scared that I couldn’t do this.  Those notes are still on my wall, and I’m leaving them there.  40 days later it’s easy to forget how rattled I was.  It’s easy to forget how difficult it is to get here.  It’s easy to forget to maintain gratitude for a life clean and sober.  It takes time and a lot of work to get back to the better side of addiction, but I can return to the dark side of addiction in a hurry.

I’m feeling mostly like myself again.  Sleep seems to be the only lingering issue.  I’ve always had insomnia though, so I’m not sure I can say it’s from withdrawals.  My fiancé is home and well, I am incredibly grateful to have a supportive partner in my recovery, and in general.  Grad school is keeping me busy, but thank god I didn’t let that fall apart with my relapse.  I love what I’m studying and I am so grateful to be in school.  AA and NA have been vastly helpful in supporting my recovery as well.  This community has been foundational to my success so far this quit too.  Thank all of you.  Life isn’t easy by any means, but it is so much better than anything was while I was using.

To anyone out there struggling, just keep going.  You can't trust your brain or feelings for a little while because they will try and convince you to use again.  

I expect some waves of crap feelings, but im so grateful right now.  I also plan to keep checkin in on this sub to offer help/advice/an ear as well as learning from each of you how to become better people through many of our lowest points.  Stay strong and keep on keeping on.",9
2020-12-07 22:41:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/k8wnz5/experience_with_home_detox/,Experience with home detox,"Hi all, I’m 7 days clean and feeling much better. Wanted to share my experience going through my GP to get help, because it might be instructive.

I had been taking kratom for about 6 months, 10-20 gpd, and was ready to quit. I had the typical withdrawal symptoms whenever I didn’t dose for 24 hours, and my demanding job made that a catastrophic event. My weekly therapist recommended I talk to my GP about it, and after a lot of avoiding the subject, I finally scheduled a visit. My fear was that he would think I was an addict, and that my chart would be marked for life, and I’d never get access to sweet narcotics again... though this would not necessarily be a bad thing considering my extremely addictive personality.

I was careful to appear as innocent as possible when talking to my GP. I said that I started taking it on a recommendation from a nootropics message board for anxiety, not knowing it was addictive, thinking it was just another legal supplement. He jumped a little when I told him I was taking 10 gpd, which was actually an underestimate. His first recommendation was to taper down, but I told him I had tried and was just getting too sick. I told him I’d rather have one really shitty week than 10 kinda shitty ones. His next recommendation was just to tough it out then. I then referenced some articles about helper meds (vaguely) and asked for gabapentin and lorazepam. He would not give me loraz, even though I already have a prescription and it hadn’t proven to be a problem. He wouldn’t budge. He gave me hydroxyzine instead. 

This quit was unsuccessful. The gaba scrip was too low dose (100 mg) and the hydrox just put me to sleep.

At this point I asked for a referral to a psychiatrist. Two weeks later I had an appointment with a psychiatric PA who prescribed me 300 mg of gaba, three times a day for anxiety and RLS. She also prescribed propranolol, a beta blocker commonly prescribed for high blood pressure, as needed for physical symptoms like sweats, hot flashes, etc. 

Using this combination, I had a very mild withdrawal. I was able to work when needed, and took some time off from work as well (two days plus a weekend) to weather the worst of it. I scheduled a silent retreat during those four days. 

The combination of the helper meds, time off work, and being away from family made this withdrawal, frankly, a breeze. If I had done it at home, with two crazy kids running around, it still would have been doable, but a little harder.

Tomorrow I see the psychiatric PA again and we are going to go over next steps to help manage PAWS and the underlying anxiety that caused me to use kratom in the first place. 

As I come away from this, I’m very glad I went the medical route. If you have any questions, or just need some encouragement, feel free to DM me. You can do this. Fuck kratom.",19

In that time, I have quit a few different times. mostly just for a couple weeks here and there. But march of this year I managed to take 52 days totally kratom free. It was the hardest thing I've ever done and I was so proud of myself at that time. I felt emotions again and I was not a numb zombie for once. But something pulled me back to the Kratom and I honestly don't even remember how it happened. I have no memory of the day I relapsed but as soon as I did it I was RIGHT BACK WHERE I STARTED 52 DAYS PRIOR.

In fact, my daily doses climbed a lot higher. I quickly reached the point where I am now which is 25 to 30 GPD. And even at this dose it BARELY scratches the itch and I could easily double that amount but I have to force myself not to. My friends, I have to cut this out of my life. It is hindering my personal growth in so many ways. The worst part is only a couple close friends know I am struggling with his issue and they don't really understand or think it's that bad. And I wouldn't expect them to understand.

I can't afford to take time off of work until next year so I am not sure how I am going to quit yet. I am just at the beginning stages of mentally accepting the fact that I need to quit this for good and not touch it ever again. I'm thinking my best bet might be a slow taper, but my self discipline lately has been total horseshit.

 I am an active member of the gym which is helpful, though in my kratom induced state of being my work outs are pretty half assed if I'm honest. Looks like I need to stock up of some vitamins and supplements here soon....I just don't know anymore man. 

I do know that the previous times I've been successful in quitting this sub reddit has been a big help to me. I need to be more active on here and chat with/support other addicts so we can get through this together. Feel free to direct message me if you would like to support each other I think that would be helpful for the both of us. Hope to hear from you guys soon. I will keep everyone updated on my progress and hope you all will do the same.",4

I sat quietly drinking my coffee just waiting for it to hit. I shook off the concrete and pulled myself up to get ready. Clothes, teeth, hair. 

Walking out the door it was cold, 
And I forgot to start my car.

I stopped for more coffee and paired it with a pack of cigarettes.
Usually going through a pack in a month or two because I vape, I smoked two on my 30 minute drive to work.

I felt the slight panic and outrage of everything i had been numbing for as long as I can remember start to creep into my already lethargic mind. It’s so odd to be feeling so many things at once, and so overwhelming. 

I kept myself together as I walked into work.

“It could be worse.” I thought.

It will be eventually.

I tapered out of a methadone clinic and had the worst 6 weeks of my life follow. I used Kratom HEAVILY during this time, dosing 3-5 times a day at around 6G at a time and was still feeling insane methadone withdrawal. After those withdrawals went away I was now hooked on Kratom. I lowered my dose and quit and was able to stay clean for about 4 months before jumping back on at high doses,

Currently: I have been using Kratom straight for about 2 years now since the last break, and have gotten my dose to such a low amount considering, but I think the low dose in at causes withdrawal symptoms every day/night with really bad RLS. I’m down to taking 2-4 grams only 1-2 times daily, but on days where I take only 1 dose I can really feel the restless legs and headaches. I’m slowly tapering to quit but I feel like the way I’m going about it is wrong since I’m dosing once, I still feel withdrawal about every day. I have absolutely NO motivation to do anything, and have major depression and anxiety that follows. Any advice on how I should taper out? I’m thinking of switching to a small dose 2-3 times a day to keep a more steady flow of Kratom in my system, rather than all at once.",2

I have a pretty good relationship with my doctor. Just don't wanna ruin my medical record and have that mark on it. I've heard plenty of stories in AA of people who get into a horrible accident, in extreme pain, and their doctor won't rx meds bc of their addiction even if its not opiates.

I have tried so many times to quit and relapsed. I quit a couple of years ago just fine, I wish I never picked up the powder again. This time is SO much worse. If you are here and thinking that you can take kratom on occasion, you are absolutely wrong. It’s an insidious trap...that takes away your life tiny piece by tiny piece. Every person I know who started taking it has gotten addicted and struggled with it...several friends, my sister, and her husband. 

A little background. I’m a 31yo female, 5’1 130lbs and I’m now taking 30-35gpd which is insane for anyone but especially my size. My body is at capacity and I feel sick morning til night. I have a list a mile long of physical symptoms and am terrified to go to the doctor for fear that I have done serious and permanent damage to my body. Severe reflux, sour stomach, throat issues, trouble breathing (I also smoke cigarettes unfortunately) heart palpitations and pain, I could keep going. I have no idea what’s going on anymore and walk around in a kratom fog constantly. I was very full of life prior to kratom and now I am so numb. I rarely cry or laugh. I suffered from depression and anxiety and thought kratom was a miracle at first...now it is 10x worse. 

I was so proud of myself when I bought my first house last year. I’m a single female and work really hard, I also don’t have a roomie or anything. I have always put in work for myself to grow. Now my flowerbeds are neglected, I rarely go to the gym, my yoga practice has dwindled and I don’t hike with my dog as much. But even more than that and something that you don’t understand unless you’ve struggled with an intense addiction...it takes away your COURAGE and SELF TRUST to the point where you have no agency over your life. There have been countless times, I’ve said I was done and dumped my kratom only to buy a new bag a few hours after waking in the morning. I’m ready to be brave and face this shit once and for all. Addiction to this extent feels like being stuck in a nightmare with no way out. I’m so ready to do what needs to be done. I’m scared of how bad the physical withdrawals will be. I’m scared of not having an escape anymore and having to feel all of my heartbreak and pain again. I’m so ready to be proud of myself again. This isn’t the first time I’ve faced adversity in my life...I’ve pulled myself out many times and I know I’m strong. But damn this one is going to take all I’ve got. 

Thanks for reading and being there. I’m going to try to keep up to date with this to be held accountable. Tomorrow is my quit day and I’m going cold turkey. I took off the rest of the week and have pedialyte and Epsom salt for baths. I’m ready to tackle this and can’t get any lower. I essentially wake up in withdrawal and go to bed nodding out. And that’s my life. I can’t stand it anymore and can’t fail.",9

I never had constipation to the level that some on this sub have experienced.  I never had to use an enema or go to the hospital or anything like that.  But while I was on kratom, I felt like I was never able to fully empty my bowels.  It had to strain to pass hard little ping-pong ball poops, and afterward I always felt like there was more inside me that I just couldn't get out.  I felt bloated constantly.

Now, 42 days clean, my morning poops are easy and complete.  I feel totally empty afterward.  I feel light.  I even look visibly thinner.  Before kratom, I took that feeling of complete emptiness for granted, but now it feels like a blessing every time.

If you are still struggling to get off the stuff, or if you are in the early days of withdrawal (and perhaps experiencing the opposite GI issues), keep going.  Blissful pooping lies ahead.",12

Physical part was bad for the first couple of days but nothing unbearable.  Significantly better yesterday, and worse again today.  The worst part of today has definitely been the mental aspect though.  My mood has been up and down and cravings have been intense.

I know using the drug will only make it worse and this rollercoaster, amongst other things, is a large part of why I decided to make the jump.  It just really sucks living through it. 

I am a long term opiate addict who managed to get clean for the past 7 years before discovering kratom.  Kratom has always been weird for me.  Yeah it worked for the first week or so and I really enjoyed it but it has never given my brain what it knows and loves from typical full agonists.  This of course led to higher and higher dosages to try and get the feeling it desires.  Thus, I actually have been finding myself craving stronger opiates.  This is so distressing as I feel like I had moved on from this part of my life and I had finally reached a place where I didn't think about using dope every single day.  Yet another reminder of why I need to get off this stuff and stay off it.  That is no live to live and I need to return my brain to homeostasis. 

As I am sure everyone here is aware, this is not 'just a plant' or a harmless member of the coffee family.  And to a person already predisposed to opiate abuse, it is a nightmare.  I wish I had never taken this.

I quit back in July, and the first few months were absolute hell. Allow me to just say I have suffered immensely from anxiety, depression, panic disorder, and sleep disorders, and upon quitting all of that surfaced at once. 

The recovery took up until now, and I really did feel like I was dying the first two months. The amount of stress and I had literally made me think I had a brain tumor, and forced me to dissociate so hard that I completely forgot who I was at times. Went to my doc, checked for a tumor and I was healthy, but the obsessive nature I experienced rooted from my anxiety was an all time high. It was extremely difficult. It was like Kratom stripped me of my humanity entirely besides my mental health issues.

Fast forward to now, I’m actually back to where I was before I started taking Kratom. Within the last month my brain fog lifted and I finally feel like a human being again. It is amazing, and I am so grateful I made it through the recovery process okay.

A lot of people will say that this withdraw isn’t bad. I’m here to tell you that my experience with quitting benzodiazepines, amphetamines, M, and nicotine paled in comparison to Kratom. I think it’s because of how okay it was deemed around me by society, and upon quitting I never had cravings, just awful awful panic episodes 24/7 of me thinking I was going to die or not go back to the person I was before. It took so long to reach mental clarity from kratom, it was very scary.

However, if I can do this, you can do this 100%. If you are battling with this right now, you can win. If you are like me and have been using this to cope with a deep imbalance regarding your mental health, please don’t be discouraged. The people I have met on here are winners and inspirations to my life, and it leads me to believe that there isn’t a single soul on this sub that can’t quit. I truly, dearly, from the bottom of my heart believe in every last one of you, and if you can’t do it for yourself do it for your family. Do it for your friends. Do it for me. Whatever it takes, because you deserve better than this disgusting green slime. So much better.

If anyone ever needs to talk, I’m always open. That is what got me through the first few months, talking to people that went through my similar experience, and it made me feel so much better at times when I thought I was going to absolutely lose my mind. This community is an absolute treasure, and I cannot thank it enough for what it has given me the strength to do.

Edit: this will not happen to all of you, I would like to point out that my case was closer to one of the worst possible ways to quit. I went CT from a panic attack, while also being sleep deprived. All around not a good mixture. However, I also wanted to make a point that a lot of people have prolonged recoveries from this substance, and if it has been a while, you are not alone. It makes me feel uncomfortable when I hear people on this sub give a timeframe of when YOU should feel better, commonly putting that timeframe between 1-3 months.

Everyone recovers differently. I’ve come across so many like me who took longer to recover, and I don’t want anyone thinking that there is something wrong with them since it may be taking longer than ‘normal’, as this personally made me feel hopeless and alone, when in reality I wasn’t by a long shot. Don’t put a timeframe on this, because if you don’t meet it, it may make this harder. Just do your best to eat healthy, exercise, and focus on your mental health. You got this.",80

One of the reasons  I stopped when I did was to have my first thanksgiving in 6 years without using kratom. Well I made it! I enjoyed all the food without needing to keep an eye on when to take a kratom dose. Really looking forward to Christmas without Kratom. Non covid years its 3 days of running around non stop and I distinctly remember trying to have capsules on me all the time. Doubt its that busy this year but the way I enjoyed food on Thanksgiving I imagine this will be the same.

I can say I have more naturally occurring happy days then my last post around day 60. Winter and lack of sunlight is just a total bummer.  3 weeks ago I decided to have some alcohol (I go on long spurts of not drinking because it always ends with days of no sleep/anxiety......) this time was no different sadly. I did not have any urges to take kratom but I did think about how this was my go to back in the day. 

Not sure what to say exactly. It does get easier past the 45 day mark. Time seems to fly by when you aren't timing your day around a dose of Kratom.  It was cool to have my phone say you made it 90 days today. Which I completely forgot about. As said I naturally enjoyed thanksgiving without thinking about a dose. 

I'll reiterate that Black Seed Oil did help me a lot. Noopept has provided some days of energy but lost its stimulation effects quickly. Workouts still suck hopefully I can say that Im into a routine by the next post at 120 days.

Feel free to shoot a message. I'll try to keep a better eye on my posts for anyone with questions. It does get easier without Kratom. For those thinking about quitting. Now is the time. You can be free of this stuff by spring time and hopefully we will all get our lives back from this horrible covid.",14

I was having a pretty fantastic weekend.  I was motivated to do 56 miles on my bike grinding some physical activity out. I got the endorphin high of doing some hard shit.  I was finally starting to think I was past the worst of it.  

This morning I got up and I was confronted with a familiar feeling.  The feeling reminiscent of week 2 of my battle.  Extreme lethargy, depression, lack of motivation, wanting to just sit there and suffer.  Brain fog, anxiety.  I thought to myself WTF.  Am I just physically exhausted?  I determined that this was not the case.  This was so familiar to me it's definitely post acutes out of nowhere.  This is a hell of a drug.  I would not wish this on my worst enemy.  Just when I thought I was good it comes back and tries to take your soul.  When your on the edge of the pit it kicks you back down the hole.  

I will not let it take me... I must persevere...",10

I’ve found a few videos on how the success rate of staying clean goes up at least 25% if you eliminate both. Something to do with the cravings. You need to get your brain to stop craving ANYTHING. Anyways, I feel like that might be my problem. 
Any thoughts on this? Has any one been truly successful with quitting their substance while continuing the nicotine habit? I’m feeling pretty strongly that I need to drop the nicotine now to be successful, but scared shitless while I’m dealing with the kratom.

Started smoking cigarettes a couple days ago after not smoking for years. Just ordered some nicotine patches so hopefully this stint is short. 

Im having plumbing issues and my whole basement flooded and washing machine is on the fritz. I tried my best to youtube it up and fix it myself but its something I have to have a professional fix. Not having clean clothes is rough. Every day has turned to almost constant dread or anxiety. Life is not fun anymore. The icing on the cake is I have to wait another month till my insurance kicks in to have a surgery that I can't afford and my health is taking a toll.

I'm not sure if it was ever mentioned on here before. I'm positive that most people would find this book helpful. It's called ""lost connections"" by Johann Hari. It's about depression but heavily goes into addiction. It's a great audio book as well, read by the author. He has a great ted talk too "" Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong"" he's also appeared on JRE #1250.    


I think anyone who is quitting and once through the initial physical symptoms should begin a journey of what addiction really is and what it means to them specifically.   

I've been on and off Kratom now for 3 years and I've decided I finally had enough. I'm on day 5 now and really struggling with the physical side effects. I'm trying to stay positive though and to learn from the entire experience. I understand now that I need to deal with my ""problems"" or what I consider is wrong with myself at the heart of them, instead of masking them. Anyway, the support on here has been great.

2020-12-06 17:19:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/k83f86/my_best_taper_plan_for_quitting_kratom/,My Best Taper Plan for Quitting Kratom,"Tapering is a method of quitting Kratom where you slowly reduce your daily intake until you are free from the addicting substance while avoiding a great deal of the mental and physical anguish quitting Kratom brings.  

Tapering carries with it some serious risks.  Tapering requires time, patients, dedication and a hell of a lot of willpower.  The risk of cheating or not following through with a Kratom taper is high.  

A taper gives Kratom a chance to screw with your head by persuading you that controlling Kratom is possible for you.  If you give Kratom a chance to screw with your head you might screw up.  I screwed up. 

I went from 30 gpd to 8 and then my body adjusted to the lower dose.  I started to enjoy it again and I thought if I could keep my daily habit at eight (8) gpd I could still enjoy Kratom and there would be no trouble.  

A week later I was back up to 15 gpd.  A couple weeks after that near my previous levels (30 gpd).

So I made some changes.   And Taper 2.0 began. 

This time I went in with an Iron Constitution.    

Every morning I would say out loud: 

I will not allow Kratom to own me.   I am dedicated to Quitting Kratom and I am never going back.  

\-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

\*My daily intake of Kratom was 30 grams per day.  The example below shows how I tapered from that level.  Unless your daily intake is also 30 grams per day your specific numbers will be different.  You will have to input your own numbers.   

Here is my plan:  

**First Drop: Twenty (20) percent.** 

In my case, 30 gpd reduce by 6 grams (20% of 30).  Divide new daily intake (24 ) into four (4) equal doses 24/4= 6 (6 grams per dose)  

I spaced my doses out equally throughout the day remembering to bring the last dose to bed with me because I knew I would need it to combat overnight anxiety.   

I nursed my doses instead of taking them all at once.  I put each of my doses into an empty, half-gallon, plastic container and filled it with water.  I wanted to have a nice steady feed throughout the day. 

I stayed at this new level for three full days before attempting my second drop.

**Second Drop: Ten (10) percent.**  

In my case, 24 gpd minus (-) 10 percent

24gpd - 2.4 grams (10% of 24) = 21.6 grams.

My new level was 21.6 gpd.  I divided that level into four (4) equal doses-- 21.6/ 4 = 5.4 (4 equal doses) 

I stayed at this level for three (3) full days before attempting my next drop.  

**I repeated this process of reducing by 10 percent and holding new amount for three full days until I went under 20 gpd.** 

**After I went under 20gpd I reduced the amount by one (1) gram and held the new amount for three full days before making another drop.  I repeated this until I went under 12 gpd.**

**After I went under 12 gpd I reduced the amount by one-half (.5) gram and held the new amount for three full days before making another drop.**  

**I repeated this until I was at ZERO gpd**

**Finally:**

**I threw whatever the hell was left down the toilet and flushed!**

**That's all it is.**    

Notes: 

This is my taper plan.  It may not be right for you.  I am not a substance abuse doctor,  just someone who tried different methods and found this one to work for me.",7

BRAIN FOG," Well, today is 7 months clean after taking kratom for 7 years straight. I'm thinking I was taking anywhere between 30-60gpd for the first 4 years, then it got up to 100-120gpd the last two years. 

 Anyway, I have horrible brain fog. Dissociation, and derealization lightly but enough to effect certain areas of my life. Over the past 7 months, I've had about 3 or 4 days (literally) where I thought things were a little better, but besides that, the other 207 days have been the worst of my life (mentally.) 

 I feel like I'm on auto pilot/a zombie from the point I wake up in the morning, till I go-to bed at night. My memory is so horrible, it feels like I have Dementia or something like it. I have bad anxiety, and some slight depression, I've lost my ambition and drive even though I have ample opportunities to do things, I just don't have the interest anymore.

 If there's anybody out there that has gone through similar stuff, and got better, please give me some hope, because this is fucking horrible.

I had bad chills, RLS at night, and lethargy, but none of that was unexpected and it was easier than I thought it would be. Day three was where it all came crashing down. My anxiety went through the roof, I felt depressed, and my mood suffered big time. I pushed through into day 4 and luckily things felt a little better. Much less chills and body aches, but anxiety was still there. It seems counter intuitive but I think working actually helps me during withdrawal because I’m not bored.

I would wake up so tired til I dosed, I would sleep but be exhausted in the morning.  Then I had no idea but I had no confidence and wasn’t social and totally lost my motivation unless I just dosed.  So around Labor Day I signed up to do this health retreat and they gave me a list of drugs and supplements to not be taking before coming.  I’m not on any prescriptions and I don’t drink, but kratom and coffee were on the list.  So I stopped taking kratom first,  and I was in for a rude awakening, no clue I would have withdrawals or anything after the third night I started to look up Kratom withdrawals and found the thread.  

So I quickly switched to a two week taper, and then went C.T. .  The taper honestly wasn’t bad I actually felt better and when I went C.T.  It was bad for a few days with acutes not as bad as the original 3 days.   The PAWs for me were the biggest challenge.  Everything I read here was dead on. It was crazy bc I would feel better , then I would have anxiety and depression and just seriously exhausted.  The insomnia lasted to just recently I still take a few nights a week something to sleep over the counter or prescription.  For me it was a lot harder then quitting drinking, just drinking I had a lot more fun doing.  

The good news as the thread says it so worth quitting that is why I’m posting.  I have had zero craving personally but I think bc it was so horrible the last few months for me I wasn’t feeling good anyway.  The PAWS were tough but it does get better.  I’m not sure if I’m just having a good week and they will return but it honestly was like I got to day 70 and felt better like w energy and much more clear,  but up til that week for me I thought it was the new normal just being exhausted, anxious, depressed, and brain fog.  Still I wouldn’t trade those feelings to be back on K.  So I hope I’m out of the woods.  I think I used for 10 to 12 months so I might be,  either way I’m plowing through it and never going back I became a slave to it.  

I didn’t know if I ever would post, but honestly this thread gave me so much info and hope.  So I hope this helps somebody struggling w the quit.  For me the accutes are tough but you will get through,  I took lots of supplements and exercised a ton.  The PAWs were tough bc I questioned wether I was insane or it was me, but then I would check in here and realize a lot of people were dealing w the same thing so don’t freak out it’s tough but normal.  Lastly,  the people saying it gets better just keeping going are 100% correct, and looking back at the PAWS they were tough going through them but just knowing it is normal at that phase took the power away from them.  

So I hope this helps a bit",12

I have severe anxiety and panic disorder, had problem with it even before the K, but it has definitely made things worse 

I have some helper meds. Lyrica, Clonidine, BSO, DLPA, Valerian. I'm reluctant on taking any of them, but don't think I will be able to make it through the anxiety without something. I'm also prescribed Ativan and have been using that only in emergency panic situations if im at work or something. 

I'm not going to lie I'm really terrified. I have not gone more than 16 hours or so in the past 2 years or more.  Been taking K for 3 and half years, approx. 40 gpd. I tapered down to about 9 grams and today took maybe 8 grams included the last dose i took an hour ago. 

I need help and accountability partners, I'm psyching myself out so bad, leading to near panic attacks just thinking about the the morning. I'm really determined to quit this shit though, its detroyed me and left me mentally, physically, emotional and spiritually broken...",9

I give love for those who are quitting, quited, going to quit and so on. This has to be the 7th time I am going to quit, did a post a few months ago and that did not go too well. I like to create this post even if no one saw it, to make it official.

I post a lot for things to help reduce and shorten withdrawals with kratom, I will briefly comment on this for new people wanting to quit. With that said, I had to go through a few quits, it made my urge to quit stronger each time. Don't beat yourself up if you ""failed"" a quit, it's apart of the journey. So here's the game plan:

12/6/2020 (I am up late): This is a family day, so don't go overboard, but the rapid taper will start after today. Take some Argimate, magnesium and low dose D-X-M to get the process started.

12/7/2020 to 12/10/2020: stop morning dose, night take usual dosage (so I can sleep, hate not going to sleep).

12/11/2020: From here I could jump and use a benzo to go to sleep, or I will taper more on the night dosage bit by bit for 5 days.

While doing this, I will take the supplements I took before, that broke past the acute withdrawals and kept me off of kratom for more than a month. Here are the supplements (do your own research and talk to your doctor before taking things):

1. Low Dose D-X-M (30 mg, every 4-6 hours): NMDA antagonist (lowers tolerance) + an antidepressant
2. magnesium (400mg, morning and night): NMDA antagonist (lowers tolerance)
3. Argimate (200-500mg, every 2-4 hours): NMDA antagonist + a2 receptor antagonist (reduce withdrawals)
4. anti-diarrhea pill (max 2-3 in the morning, 1-2 night time if no dose at night)
5. CDP-choline (go for re-sensitive dopamine receptors)
6. sleep supplement complex (melatonin, l-theanine, glycine, valerian root, etc.)

I  will keep a journey and update this post with my journey. Wish me luck and I wish luck for those going through this!

edit:

the dosage  I do on average, used to do lower dosage with green horned maeng da, but got a yellow strain  called Yellow Cambodian:

\- 10 grams inthe morning

\- 5 grams around lunch  or 1-2pm

\- 10-15  grams in the evening

&#x200B;

12/7/2020: Today was not exactly to plan, but took less, I only took 6 grams this morning and gonna avoid taking any more till my night dose. As long as I do not take more then before that counts! Even if you ""fail"" one dose it is ok, just keep on the course. (Evening) Holy crap, it is just me or does quitting kratom each time get harder? I did form more of a tolerance then before, I am thinking I will slow down the taper a bit. probably repeat what I did today for a couple days before dropping my morning dose.",2

I've finally found a girl I can see myself with forever and she doesn't want to be with an addict. I told her last night that I was giving up both kratom and nicotine at the same time starting today. I'm sticking to my kratom withdrawal but the anxiety from the combo got too intense. Ended up caving on the nicotine...  It crushed her and broke my heart.  Do you guys have any experience with dropping both at the same time? I need to get off these ASAP.

Just some thoughts....,"My first quit was 8 days. My second was 21 days and now I’m on my 3rd and hopefully final quit. My physical withdrawals lasted around 20-25 days total. Mental lethargy lasted until about 60 days. My use was 45 gpd for 8 months. On and off for 2 years with the quitting. 

One issue That I see a lot that I don’t necessarily agree with is gettin g heavily medicated when u quit. My first “quit” I used gabapentin, weed, and a little bit of clonopin to help maintain some sort of stability and found that when I would stop taking them I would just be filled with anxiety and other discomforts. My second quit I used clonodine and this seemed to help a lot without as many side effects once I was off of it. My best advice would be to get through these wds without any medicinal help. The process is faster and better for you in the long run. However, if you are going to go the medicinal route my best advice is to get a script of clonodine. This is the best med for opiate/kratom withdraws imo. It took away a lot of anxiety and even helped me sleep. You do feel a little edgy once ur off of it but nothing compared to gabapentin or benzodiazepines.  

Today I feel 100 percent physically but cravings are real just bc I know k would take away any boredom. Reading the day 1-10 posts from you guys helps me a lot , it really does bc it’s so easy to forget the hell we put ourself through. Thank you. Hope this helps someone.",19

The longest I went without it was 3 months. At the start of the year with pandemic looming I started dosing 4 or 5 times a day at 5g per dose. I cut off 0.1g per dose per day.

I dose 6 times throughout the day to keep an even concentration. When I used to dose 3 or 4 times I would always experience inter dose withdrawl. Taking smaller doses consistently has been better.

I was working 5 days a week, hitting the gym 3 or 4 times a week doing classes, eating pretty clean, meditating, and trying my damndest to stay busy and not succumb to being negative. When I get down to 2g doses I really start feeling shitty. Mood swings that would rival roid rage, existential anxiety, depression, hot and cold sweats, shivers, diarrhea, and lost hope.

I have messed up recently and taken a few extracts and 5g doses over the last few days. I recently tried to do it cold turkey and made it about 30 hours without kratom. I caved and took 5g to attempt to sleep.

Im not new to kratom or addiction in general. I used to be addicted to booze and pain pills. Since I started kratom I haven't messed with that stuff. Obviously, kratom has turned on me and the negatives outweigh the positives. Im just do mentally exhausted. Part of me worries I dont have enough fight left in me. 

Its been putting a strain on my marriage, out financial situation and overall holding me back from having a fighting chance. What really complicates things if the whole pandemic lockdown. I normally would be going to meetings, the gym, outside at the park more, and hanging with a few friends. Im not a super socialite but quaratining has been tough on my mental health. Past experience has always proven the more I isolate the worse my addiction and mental health get.

The money is running out and both I ame my wife have missed a ton of work in the last year due to covid. Quitting kratom is already tough, but with all the nuances of isolation and corona virus it makes it extra tough.

Im going to check in here throughout the day. I wanna treat this is a live journal with the hopes that I can help other people. 

I have a great therapist, supportive family, some vitamins, and a pretty chill setting. It  still is really tough and if my financial situation allowed it I'd go back to rehab. Dont get me started on the USA and their wonderful health-care.

Im scared out of my mind but this shit has been controlling me for too long. Im eating a quinoa rice bowl and about to start watching the Good Place. I really have to be careful about what I consume during this withdrawl. I have to take a step back from the pandemic and politics.",13

I'm currently  at 19.2ish grams per day. I began my kratom journey after I was tired of/worried about taking the Norco after my daughter was born. I also have a bad back that was exasperated by the pregnancy. After a 1.5 year of Norco, following the prescription guide, I made the switch. My daughter is now 5 and the other day I realized I have been taking my ""juice"" for more than half her life. She doesn't remember when mama would eat breakfast and lunch with her, she doesn't get that experience  anymore. Through my kratom usage I stopped eating all but dinner meals. Yet I've gained weight because I drink almost 64oz of orange juice a day, also paxil. 

A couple years ago I had some bad months. My temper was high and emotions all over the place. I felt that my unmedicated bipolar disorder was in a bad place. I didn't have insurance for mental so I went to my GP and asked to be put on the garbage I was on in high school, paxil. I didn't want to negatively  effect my daughter so I figured this would be better than the chance of overreacting to her in some way.  Now I have mental coverage and through the help of my therapist and GP I am in my 2nd week of the withdrawls. 

All I know right now is that, just like the paxil, I don't want to be on this stuff anymore. I'm so tired of taking it. I'm fucking sick of orange juice. I sick of having to figure out how long I will be gone from the house and how many bottles of juice I need to bring with me. I'm sick of not eating delicious food anytime I want.

I've said I wanted to quit before. I taper down (not following the suggestions here) then stay at my old sweet spot for a bit, then go back up. 

I'm scared I won't quit. I'm scared of the WD. 

Parents: do you recommend not parenting for any of the WD days? I want to make sure when I get there that my daughter will be looked after.

Thank you for allowing me to rant. I don't know if this is cohesive but I am hoping to keep myself accountable here. All advice and whatnot I welcome. 💜",6

The week I took off work was fairly easy, just no energy, interrupted sleep and feeling low. Second week was back to work,  struggled a bit here and there. This past week a pet has been barely able to walk so that is something I’m trying to deal with, definitely got me down. 

I’m definitely still struggling, there hasn’t been a quick recovery. Forcing myself through work, wanting to leave asap. During my 7 months I gradually improved , 100 days seeming to be a good point of 99%. At day 160 or so I started to notice feeling good in the morning, those sleep endorphins still going strong after I woke up. More dreams of being high around this time too. I took it as a good sign I was recovered.

I see a lot of quicker recoveries than mine so just want to throw it out there, if you have a long history like I do( going back longer than my k use) and aren’t seeing huge improvements, feeling on top of the world in weeks or less like mentioned in some posts, hang in there. 

I hoped a 2 month slip would have eased quicker, but I’ll be patient and tough it out. Being back on k after any clean time feels like a big burden, and it is. It’s nice for a few hours, then an hour, then 15 minutes. One thing getting me through is thinking about the decision to take k, and how much of a fork in the road it is. It’s a decision that could alter the course of your life for years, one decision leading to some different life path, probably ending up with regret.",7

First let me thank each and everyone of you for sharing your joy, successes, your pain and your failures.  For me this disease of addiction is like cancer, it destroys my life in all areas, mental, emotion, spiritual, and physical.  For me, if left untreated it will kill me, just like cancer would if I were to not address it.  My post here is about the physical damage associated with Kratom use and that list is long.  For this post, the focus is the integumentary system which is the skin and all of its appendages.  To make it even more defined, specifically the hair and nails.  Over the years as I check into this thread, I often see posts regarding hair changes.  Although my search has not been exhaustive, I would like to ask my fellow quitters if any have experienced changes to their nails?  This includes finger as well as toes.  

My personal experience was at the end of my Kratom use, I developed fungal infections in every single toenail.  There was zero involvement of any fingernails.  I took no medications to treat this since I was laser focused on unchaining my Kratom burden.  As my journey in recovery from Kratom progressed, at about 7-8 months I noticed that my toenails were looking much better!   I continued to not address the toenails at all, and after about a year, voila!   My toenails had returned to their normal humble selves.  I kindly ask for anyone interested and who has experienced a similar situation or even have an ongoing problem with tinea unguium, onychomycosis or really gross nail changes to comment here.  Please include the genesis, the course it ran, what was done and present state of the situation.  Much peace and love to all and thank you.",10

Not sure if weight gain and kratom are linked here but...

I was on methadone and came off in early March to be on kratom. I think I was at 35 a day to 15 a day for months. Decided to reduce my dose by a third on a whim and I def feel it. 

Weird thing is, I've been doing calisthenics and dieting since March and have not budged on my weight, not even a pound. No matter what I was eating, how hard I was working out. 

I came down to 10/day about six days ago and I've already lost three pounds. I look way skinnier. I'm not bloating all the time. 

I'm not super sick either. I sleep well at night. I have to eat edibles twice a day to be functional but... 

I really feel like the kratom was holding my bodies metabolism back? And my will to do things? And energy? I feel like once I'm off it, I'll get a lot of vitality back. Just have to make it thru. 

Anyone have something similar happen??",5
2020-12-05 11:34:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/k7ak4c/sub_advice/,Sub advice,"Hey, everyone!

Posted some updates earlier (check out my profile posts) but I did the suboxone method to quitting after a really traumatic experience regarding quitting Kratom.

Just want to clear some of the air around suboxone— it works for some people. Don’t be afraid of it, if you have self control and KNOW what to do (rather than staying on it a long time or trying to abuse it), it’s very possible. It was harmless for me. 24 hours of detox to start it, wasn’t too bad. The actual process of weaning off subs was easy. I’m below 0.25mg right now and I’ll be off of it fully within 2 weeks. 

If you’re scared of quitting and have access to a psychiatrist who has helped Kratom patients out before- be open to it. 

I’m more stable mentally than I have been in my entire life. I have bipolar disorder so I’ve been on cycles and cycles of meds, and I finally found what fits well with me. Kratom fucks up your mind.

Also— sex drive? Can we talk about that. Came back with a vengeance within 7 days of quitting and has been non-stop. All of the “small” problems in my mind have disappeared. 

Anyway, good luck to everyone— I know everyone’s brain chemistry is different. But y’all can do it, regardless of the way you choose. Don’t feel like choosing the suboxone route is “cheating”- suffering is not a competition. (Referencing when someone on this sub said I was cheating— HA!) 

Have a great holiday season y’all! Message me with questions, won’t be replying to this comment",6

After going through a incredibly rough break up (which i still struggle with at times, probably should look into therapy and casual dating) last year and all this COVID shit ive been using off and on this year.

Ive started to really notice the negative side effects again and realize i HAVE to lay off this shit if i want to feel normal and be well. I also got tired of feeling like a junkie and spending so much money. Driving to the gas station every day barely able to look the  clerk in the eye whos probably thinking ""look at this typical junkie"". Enough is enough.

Luckily ive only been using for 2 months this stretch so the withdrawals wont be as bad as other quits. Just restless legs and some irritability. I just had to drive by my usual gas station i score at to get groceries. I talked myself through it and said dont stop keep driving dont stop keep driving and am so grateful i didnt stop in there. When i left the house I figured i had a 50 50 chance of stopping in there but im thankful i didn't. 

I have some kava for the daytime and OG kush for the evenings to help me stay settled and reduce symptoms and cravings. Im tired of being in this cycle. So much wasted money and the toll on my mental health is real.

Fuck kratom",12

I've been taking kratom for about 5 years on and off with big gaps in-between. I would take it for couple weeks, then stop for couple of months. Then do it again for a while. For a long time I took it only on weekends, then only after work in the evening, but in the last six months I've been on it constantly. Took about 5 doses a day, about 3-5g each.

I started taking agmanite about 2 months ago and it diminished the kratom euphoria by I'd say 90%. It still does something, but I don't feel that great on it anymore. So I was trying to stop taking agmanite to feel the euphoria again, but after couple of days the brain fog and lack of motivation would kick in.

I feel like agmanite helps a bit with my mental problems and maybe I should get off of kratom since I've been experiencing more side effects lately - irritability, exhaustion in the morning, dehydration, depression and lack of motivation.

Hope it goes better this time. Last time I tried to quit i went back to it after about a week. I had horrible PAWS for couple of day, but the worst part was when the withdrawals were over but I realized that my life was still shit and I was too anxious and had no energy or motivation to do anything about it. 

Thanks guys for all the tips.",3

I don't judge kratom, it's just an herb, but there is a ridiculous amount of people physically dependent on it and also addicted to it today and so many people still talk about it as if it's a totally safe, harmless, non-addictive substance. I'm all about harm reduction so if Kratom gets you off heroin or pain pills or whatever...that's an improvement. And that was my deal to some extent. I have had my battles with heroin, pain pills, kicked Suboxone twice and kratom definitely helped. I was clean off opiates for a year or so and I got back on it with the kratom. Started with every now and then. The physical dependence comes pretty quickly if you have had past addiction and dependence on opiates. So before long I got stuck in that cycle. Can't just take off work and detox or be all tired. Plus I was working 60 hours and Kratom helped with that. But you actually don't need it and you can probably be better off and build healthy energy without it truthfully.  


Anyways my habit was probably 2 kilos a month. For about a year. And I hid it from everyone in my life which was stressful and kept me distant from people and isolated me to some extent. Also I found that since I had that kratom dependence, it was quick to relapse onto opiates later after I hit some struggles in my life and sobriety. So for the past month I had stopped taking Kratom and was using black tar heroin. So my habit was 50 gpd+ of Kratom for a year and then heroin with a history of addiction.  


I had an opportunity to take some time off and so I jumped off cold turkey 23 days ago. The first week is fucked. Just to be honest. I try to just pass the time disassociating in bed. That's how I have gotten through some fucked up shit in my past. It is something I developed when I had to do some time which was a result of my addiction. When I was in solitary confinement. So I guess I can kind of remove myself mentally to some extent. But I was tossing and turning. Sometimes the restless legs would flare up where I felt like I was running a marathon. Stomach issues. No appetite. Energy level is totally drained. No energy to do anything except lay in bed. But you just have to get thru this part.  


Day 5 I went to an NA meeting. I felt like fucking shit. But I went. I started waking up and getting out and walking and being outside at day 7. My energy level was so low but being in the sun makes you feel better. Hot showers go a long way. Especially before bed. They will always help you during detox. The physical activity may be the last thing you want to do, but it definitely helps you. Slowly my appetite hard started to come back. I really was looking forward to being able to eat normally again.  


For the most part once you get past day 5-7 things start to get better every day. Some days or really some nights you might feel like you regress a little. Like day 9 might randomly feel worse than day 8. But big picture if you just stop you will reach a point where every day you feel better and it's the only way out. It's worth the sacrifice to be totally free. Because better days are ahead.  


I pushed thru some hard labor during week 2. It was brutal but I was just determined. It may have helped me push thru the withdrawals. I had to push myself hard because my energy level was so low. I would toss and turn some at night, hard to get comfortable, but I was getting 6 hours of sleep or so. I had my appetite back for the most part. Stomach issues start to minimize. I really didn't have anxiety.  


Day 20 I really felt my energy level return. I started to feel grateful to be alive again. I felt some peace. I started enjoying music again. I have been actively working a program, attending an NA meeting every day, calling my sponsor every day and that shit really just makes me feel better for some reason. I don't fully understand how it works, but for me it does work. I feel like if you deal with addiction it's important as a human being to get connected to other people and the universe. And to find people that don't judge you, that understand you and what you're dealing with and support your recovery.  


But seriously other than a few random double sneezes or maybe sometimes at night just some really minor tossing and turning but I am able to get 6-8 hours of sleep. Mentally, emotionally and physically I feel great. My energy level is at 90% or more. I am able to work hard and I'm not addicted. Hopeful.  


You can get out. Honestly I think your mental attitude towards withdrawal goes a long way. In my experience withdrawal isn't as bad as many people think it will be. You can make it thru. It's worth it!",7

It feels good to be present, level headed, and know I’m not going to wake up tomorrow with that eerie feeling of regret. There’s many times I didn’t make an ass out of myself and still had a regretful feeling the next day. 

After the funeral we went to a dinner with family where everyone of course drank a ton. I was asked 5 different times if I wanted a drink and refused. It’s crazy to me that people don’t want to accept your not drinking. I told everyone I’m DD tonight and the hubby is letting loose and that finally got them to quit asking me to drink even though they all drove home smashed. I just see a different side of things now especially sober. I don’t want to be that person driving home drunk, I don’t want to time my social events around kratom and have to premix it and hide it bc I feel like I’m doing something wrong. I don’t want to be irritated all the time or wake up hung over from any substance anymore. 

Most of all,  today reminded me of what I want people to remember about me when I pass away one day. Do I want them to remember me as the girl who got drunk all the time? The girl who was always irritated and bitchy? The girl that never accomplished anything? NO! I want to leave the imprint on this world that I’m supposed to. I want to continue to be successful, kind, and giving. I want my son to look back and say I was a good mom and that I did a lot with him. I want to be the person I truly am and I’m not me on kratom or alcohol.",12

I used opiates & suboxone daily from 2012-2018 when I jumped to kratom. Also I've been abusing adderall for the past 10 years. I tried so many times to quit but the physical wd's seemed unbearable... Until finally, I quit everything (kratom & ads) and I actually made it through the acutes. There was a point maybe a month ago where I had this day where I literally felt high on Life, but it was short lived. Lately, especially the past almost 2 weeks, I have felt deeply depressed, and I do not use that word lightly. As soon as I wake I feel a heavy emptiness weighing me down and it just hangs over me all day long. My brain is not firing correctly.. I can't seem to focus on anything to make any plans or accomplish anything. Everything feels like a chore. Prior to this dip in mood I had been doing yoga religiously, focusing on increasing muscles flexibility, every single day. Now, I don't even want to think about that. I feel empty and barely alive.

I've been thinking I should force myself to go to a meeting so that maybe someone can relate to my struggle and offer some support but even that just sounds miserable even if I know in my heart it's probably a good idea.  I'm not afraid I am going to use to escape this.. but I do think I am afraid that I have done so much damage to my brain/body this may go on for years, or even forever... 

I do not drink alcohol or smoke weed and would pass any drug test yet ""sober"" is not what I feel. I feel like a dissociated fogged and clogged up mess.. I imagine sober feels spacious and clean. That is far from how I feel.

Thanks for letting me vent and if you can relate I'd love to hear your story.",12

Since then I have taken the test, gone to the doctor and come to find that I'm 7 weeks pregnant.
It's been a little rocky, though. I have MS and fibromyalgia. I had stopped taking heavy narcotics and turned to kratom. But I still used gabapentin, amitriptyline, lexapro and welbutrin. I had also tried using 5HTP because I was going to try to switch off of anxiety medications.
Well, my PCP told me to quit all of my medications cold turkey. Which I did. That put me into a serious withdrawal, where I couldn't eat or get out of bed, and caused me to start bleeding. I went to the ER and told the doctors everything, including kratom, and they were very upset that my PCP would have me quit CT while pregnant, instead of taper. I had had a ""threatened miscarriage"". So they put me BACK on everything but 5HTP abd amitriptyline, and at a lower dose.
For kratom, they told me to taper as well. They're most concerned about the stress put on my body and baby by dropping so much, but to try and do it as quickly as possible. And I've been doing so, by spreading out my hours taking it and then dropping grams every other day. 
I just want to do it right. I'm worried about dropping quickly and then having a miscarriage. But then not dropping quick enough and hurting the baby. On top of dropping my medications.
On top of all of this, I'm sick. I took the COVID-19 test and will find out soon if it's positive.
I see my gyno soon, so hopefully he'll help me find the best way of dropping everything. He didn't seem as stressed about it because it's early and I'm doing the right thing. But it still makes me feel terrible.
I wanted to start having a baby AFTER the new year, when my PCP and I were going to start tapering everything. This isn't how I imagined my first pregnancy. And there is so much to do in so little time. I thought I would just quit all together, but that would be more damaging I guess.
Idk where I'm going with this post. Just advice on how to relax so that I can taper without too much stress on the baby, or how any other pregnant women on here have quit. I know some women who continued their pregnancy with kratom and were fine, and I would love to hear from you as well. 
But most of all... just give some encouragement. I feel a little lost.",6

I read all the posts on here for inspiration, but never posted myself. Im a long time alcoholic, got sober for about 8 months and started taking kratom for anxiety and depression. 5 grams a day turned to 10. Which eventually turned into a kilo every 10-14 days... it was great until it wasn't, then it was just awful. So I tapered way too fast down to about 25gpd, and was sick of being in detox for 2 weeks straight and just jumped off on December 1st. And have slept a total of about 8 hours from then till today. Doc gave me trazadone, but without benzos (which I cannot be trusted with) sleep is escaping me. It's awful, but reading everyone else's posts continually gives me hope that EVENTUALLY I'll be ""normal.""

Anyway, I just wanted to post. Doing new things keeps me sober. I dont have any social media, which makes me a social pariah in 2020... but just wanted to dip my toes into this reddit thing instead of just reading. Im sure I'll have something else to say soon, my brain is just all over the place right now. I did finally get exercise in today, so hoping I can get 4 hours of sleep tonight. That would be amazing...

Thanks for reading. I always appreciate reading other people's posts about quitting. Im hopeful, I know what PAWS feels like, and I know how to be sober. Just gotta put in the first month or so of miserable work, and it should be cake from there, right...?",24

I read though everything to expect with quitting Kratom (Big thanks to all you folks who put that together - much love!) and headaches don't seem to be a common experience. I'm starting to think this headache is unrelated. I don't have a history of them.

2020-12-04 15:52:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/k6tb6t/ready_to_jump_again/,Ready to jump again,"Hey guys. I used to post here a bit the last time I quit, which was over a year ago. I had taken kratom daily for about a year. I started getting all types of symptoms:

Poor digestion. Bloating and constipation. Hiatal hernia and bile reflux. MAJOR BURPING. 

Muscle aches and twitches. Muscle fatigue and burning. 

Burning and dry mouth. Acne. Thinning hair and hair loss. Weight gain. Red hot burning cheeks. 

I had a ton of lab work and testing done. I had high prolactin, low white blood count, and high cholesterol. Everything else was fine. Doctors said there really wasn't anything wrong with me! Weird because I felt like literal death. 

Soon after, I made the jump. Some issues resolved with time, and some did not. I moved to a new house and transferred my job. Things were very stressful, especially my new job position. I still could not lose weight, got bloated often, fatigue and weakness. Suspecting candida/sibo/parasites. I saw an ND and tried some supplements..strict diets..not much improvement.

After about a year of this, I lost my job. This was actually a huge relief to me. My job had been killing me mentally, and I was ready for a way out. With this huge weight lifted off my shoulders, I started improving!!!

I started working towards my mental and physical health. I lost over 20lbs and started feeling happy and excited everyday. Slowly my symptoms started disappearing! I felt like I was thriving. I started to microdose psylocibin 2 to 3 times a week, and felt like I was improving my mental state and having epiphanies. 

Well somewhere along the line, I picked up kratom again. Forgetting all the shit kratom put me through, and how disgusted I was with myself before. But it helped me. Helped me workout harder, stay happy longer, and gave me motivation to do my schoolwork. 

All was well for a few months! I did feel guilty about taking kratom, but that could not change my mind. People reassured me, saying its ""natural and better than man-made chemicals. I told myself it was okay, the kratom is helping me, its okay to have vices. Then suddenly one day it wasn't. I had some terrible digestive issues..gas, bloating, constipation. Then shortly after came the burning mouth and muscle fatigue. Thwn the hiatal hernia popped up,, add some brain fog and lack of motivation. Sprinkled in was some depression and anxiety. I quit microdosing the psylocibin (certainly it couldn't be kratom). No change after two weeks. 

So then I get back on my health groups, trying to figure out what the hell is wrong with me. Started lurking on here, and quitting kratom FB group again. 

The more I look into it, the more I truly believe it this time. Kratom is the source of these problems. There is no doubt in my mind about it. The more I learn about gut health and neurotransmitters, the more sure I am.

I am an addict. I have been addicted to cigarettes, vaping, alcohol, hydrocodone, cocaine, and now kratom.  I cannot take kratom, I will abuse it. There is no happy medium or in between. That does not exist for me. 

I am so disgusted with myself. I was thriving, yet I allowed kratom back into my life. Now I feel like death and I am so disappointed in myself. 

I have not had it as rough and some people. But I did grow up abandoned by my mother. My father and I lived with my aunt and cousins for awhile. They were like a mother and sisters to me. We moved away from them eventually, and my aunt died in 2002 (drugs), and then my favorite cousin died about 4 years later (drugs). So then it was just me and my father. He was angry, controlling, and emotionally abusive. 

I've spent over a decade suppressing these traumas with addictions. It is who I am and who I have been. But I am 30 years old now, and I don't want to be this person anymore. 

Every other addiction I have quit, was because I became absolutely disgusted with myself. I can be strong willed  and mentally tough when I am fed up.. I don't think it will be easy at all. But this is not a solution. So I am jumping again. In a week or two when my semester is over...I am jumping, and I am fucking done with this garbage. 

No taper. I only take about 3 or 4 teaspoons a day. I am aware this is not much compared to other users...but the effects it has on me mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually, are HUGE. 

I've got supplements lined up, and will not have to worry about work or school. Perfect. Will report back ✌",6

Feeling very good about my decision but I feel it's important to discuss the reality of my situation.  I was a daily user for 8 years.  I have carved deep neural pathways into my brain by dosing everyday around 4-5 PM.  If PAWs like symptoms are going to visit me, it will be during this time.  Most of the time I feel good and am on the healing path.  However even now I have very low energy days, or mood swings and irritability.  I've used kratom for so long its hard to parse out what is normal and what is my brain re calibrating.  I have drank a bit during my recovery and I feel like it does nothing but prolong the healing process.  I think if you eat good food, exercise and abstain from all other mood altering substances your recovery will be faster.  Having said that, to each their own and don't be too hard on yourself.  Everyday without kratom is a win and means your progressing.  If you find comfort in junk food or a drink now and again I don't think its the end of the world.  Just be mindful and don't replace kratom with another substance.  Replace it with squats, pullups and pushups tho because that lets you get high on your own supply :)",19

Book that really help me gone through anxiety phase is ""At Last A Life by Paul David"". Someone suggest the book here somewhere.

To all who going through this, wishing u all the best. Its get better. My anxiety also getting better where some event i expect my anxiety will be crazy but it didn't like i get anxious of getting chat notification. Thats crazy.

I have been taking Kratom for 2 years and 2 months with a max of 20-25 gpp but down to about 6 gpd for the past 6 months. I have done a quick taper from there over the past 3 weeks and have been taking about 2 GPD for the past 7 days. This is 1/4 teaspoon with coffee at 4am (when I wake up thanks to Kratom for minimal sleep), 1/4 teaspoon around lunch, and 1/4 teaspoon around dinner.

The past few days have been great and haven’t even felt like I needed K but continued with the taper to avoid WDs. I’m doing two a day workouts to keep adrenaline and serotonins high. I have been super productive at work and not really thinking about k other than how gross it is and how I want to be done with it.

Anyway here is my question. I was planning on tapering down to 1 GPD and then jumping but now I’m thinking since I’m feeling so good even at noon after no dose for 12 hours why not jump now. Oddly my noon dose makes me feel shittier than I did before I took it, it’s so small it’s like what’s the point. Would you guys recommend this approach or should I keep tapering? Next week I have a new employee to train, a board meeting and a lot of things to do where I don’t want WDs to be an issue. I think I am disciplined enough to keep tapering but at this level and based on my current state, sleep being the only major issue and RLS, should I jump? Is there still a possibility of some bad weeks ahead if I do?

Thanks for reading and sharing your insight.",4

It’s interesting to look back and see how insidious this whole addiction to Kratom can be. It really does affect so many areas of mental and physical health. 

In no way am I faulting the K itself, at the end of the day it is just a ground up leaf with some mind subtle mind altering properties. I actually just realize that it’s the weakness of the human mind, and the minds perpetual obsession with finding dead end shortcuts to some imaginary bliss. 

I’ve become a firm believer that proper sleep, nutrition, exercise, and positive relationships are truly the path to happiness, not drugs.

I started doing kratom every other day for about 3 months and recently kicked my gabapentin habit. I used kratom to help with getting off the gaba but now I am doing kratom everyday, primarily extract capsules. I have been dosing the capsules usually twice a day. Once at noon ( 2 pills ) then again around 9pm ( 3 pills ) for the past two weeks.

I've had sobriety before and really want to get that feeling back. Can anyone tell me what I am in for and if the kick compares to a long term heroin kick? The part that gets me with kicking heroin is the insane mind games and panic/ anxiety that comes with it.

A little background. This is my third quit and what I hope is my last. I did taper the first 2 times... the first quit (July 2020) I did it nice and slow and dropped by 1 GPD and felt virtually NO WD. Second quit (October 2020) I did a rapid taper and dropped about 5 GPD and started to feel gnarly physical WD symptoms on my second to last day of the taper which again, lasted a total of about 4-6 days. 

Today I'm on my 3rd day of my taper - dropping only 1 GPD - and I already am starting to feel pretty sick. Headache, RLS, tossing and turning, sore throat, congestion.

Couple questions:

Will these WD symptoms last my entire taper? I'm still at about 20 GPD use!

Since I'm already starting to feel sick, should I just CT? What can I expect from a CT quit?

I quit kratom back in 2018 after a \~8 month addiction. Honestly i dont remember the K withdrawals at all because I was also withdrawing from nicotine, and that was far worse. I was using around 50 grams per day, but the only thing I remember was diarrhea for like a month after quitting. I  decided this past summer that I'd be able to ""just take it every once in a while"". Huge fucking mistake. Currently k is the only thing I am addicted to (been able to abstain from nicotine and I consider that a victory). I am only using \~12gpd this time around, but I know it will only increase if I keep using. If I go more than 3-4 hours without using, I start getting withdrawal symptoms. Mostly its a feeling in my stomach of tension and anxiety. Its very uncomfortable. This time I am not on any antidepressants, and I am kind of worried about that. I feel like maybe the SSRI helped with the anxiety of quitting last time. I want to make quitting as painless as possible and was thinking of getting Ativan from my doc. They dont know about my substance issues, but I have never abused benzos in the past and am never going down that hole (the fact that wds can kill you scares me too much). Would this be a good idea? I also bought a little tub of vitamin C powder to help, but even when I try to sub that for a k dose, it doesn't completely get rid of the symptoms. How bad will this end up being?  Just the fact that I cant go 4 hours without using is fucking scary to me. If you've gone through both nicotine & kratom withdrawals separately, can you compare them for me? nic withdrawal was horrific and I don't think I can handle something like that right now, but I also desperately want to quit kratom.

I don't feel any PAWS or cravings at all now. I run 2 miles a day every day and get a cold shower to wake me up. I try and do Wim Hof breathing and some mindfulness every day but haven't been able to dial that in yet.

I managed to go 12 days without using THC, and I started doing even better. Like I actually felt clear-headed and productive. But I slipped back into daily THC use after a weekend binge. And now it's been a few weeks of use again. Today is day 2 without THC, and I've realized that it takes at least 10-14 days of staying away from THC for me to feel better. I had started waking up on time, meditating and studying. All of that went away when I started using THC again. I also developed a phone addiction. I would be on youtube four 8 hours a day just to keep myself distracted. But I'm trying to be mindful of that because it's equally disruptive as far as work is concerned. I still feel a little low for not having that under control. I just thought I'd post this to mark that I quit kratom and opiates after using opiates for half my life. 

Note to anyone trying to get clean: you will feel normal very soon! Just hang in there. Use whatever you need to use to get through the acutes (barring benzos and opiates). Gabapentin, THC, Clonidine, Ashwagandha and Magnesium seriously helped me through that phase. In fact, I just tapered out my gabapentin a week back. Pretty soon, I'll be able to travel with less than half the pills and powders I would have to pack :D Just some supplements this time! 

Also, I managed to quit caffeine. Been three weeks without it. I just have a cup of green tea in the morning and non-caffeinated teas during the day. Before, I was using 200-600mg of caffeine tablets a day along with the occasional Armodafinil. 

When I went on my 14 days without THC, I actually had moments of clarity. The head fog lifted.

I started using after I stopped drinking as another coping mechanism to deal with the death of my mother. I quickly became addicted because it helped me feel better and sleep at night.

He brought up a study about tapering that mentioned no one should drop more than 10% in a week/7-day period.

I started tapering a few weeks ago and have been very successful taking this 10% rule in effect.  Normally, I’d used anywhere from 30 - 50 god on days I don’t work and I would be never taking a stable amount of kratom for any remarkable amount of time. It was always up a down. One day I’d take a lot. The next I would take half of what I’d take and so on. I felt like crap with anxiety and depression when I did this and found out that taking kratom at a stable amount over time reduces a lot of negative symptoms from use.

I first stabilized at 25 gpd for a period of about two weeks and then decided I would drop only .25 grams every day. I’m now down to 19 gpd and will lower my taper to .2 grams every day once I get below 15 gpd. It’s slow, but steady and stable.",5

If a month ago you told me I'd be 28 days kratom free I'd have laughed in your face and called you insane.

I really do feel better every day and I can feel myself slowly returning. This thread and you fine people are a big part of that.

If you've been toying with the idea of quitting - start! If you're currently in the w/d process - stay with it! If you're 100 days clean - time to get that next 100 under your belt!

Don't let the fear of the time it will take to accomplish something stand in the way of your doing it. The time will pass anyway; we might as well put that passing time to the best possible use.

We can only take things one day at a time so focus on what you can control.

I was a long-term user....8 straight years and not a day without the demon. When I see that in writing it horrifies me but it’s the stark reality I’m up against as I try to get my life back.

I’m at day 7 after a 12-day taper from “just” 5-6 gpd and I simply can’t believe how bad this is. Relentless RLS, general restlessness and a deep sense of dread I’ve never come close to feeling before. 

I naively thought that because my daily dosage was so low relative to others that by day 7 things would be better, but man was I wrong. 

I take DLPA, L-theanine and grape seed extract but they don’t seem to be of much help.

Trying my best to hold on and need some hope/information to do so. So if any of you long-term users could answer the following questions I’d very, very much appreciate it.

•	⁠At what day did your RLS start to abate such that you could sleep more than 2-3 hours per night?

•	⁠At what day did the despondency show any signs of letting up?

•	⁠At what day did the all encompassing fatigue start to improve?

Any other insights you’d like to share would be appreciated!

I have tried to quit many times but have only ever lasted a few days. It is so true that when you are finally honest with yourself and ready to quit, it isn’t as hard. Granted, it was not easy at ALL for the first week+, but I must say after two weeks almost all physical is gone. Sleep is back to normal. Stomach is still really messed up but it will get better. Even with the lethargy, boredom and lack of motivation, I still have no desire to use at all. Was a very heavy user and dealt with heavy WD while working a construction job, and somehow created an amount of discipline and self-respect that I’ve never had before. One of the most important things I have been doing is FAKING IT TILL YOU MAKE IT! No matter how bad I don’t want to go to NA meetings(they are late and I work early), or clean, exercise, go to the store, work, etc I get my ass up and make myself. Afterwards I feel so much better and relaxed. I just wanted to update and share some things that have helped me. I read so many posts here that I can relate to. My days are still grey, brain is even still foggy sometimes, but if you really want to quit you can do it. Understanding that the misery will subside and surrendering to whatever higher power you choose has been very helpful to me. If you want to read some interesting stuff check out the NA book it has some very real stuff in it! I wish you all a full and spiritual recovery.

It’s easy to do when nothing seems like a positive. The positives for me are most physical symptoms are gone, I’m sleeping through the night, I can eat lunch again, my energy levels are pretty good and the brain fog has lifted, I don’t have any cravings, and I’m not using any substances to alter my mood. I’m making it through the days on my own. The things that are temporarily hard (notice I didn’t call them negatives) are a general lack of joy and motivation. I know this is what I’m experiencing now, but it will get better with time. Overall, mentally this has not been difficult because I am so sure that I can’t use kratom anymore, so I don’t have any other option but to stay quit. I know that going back to it would just make things so much worse and I don’t even think it would help in the short term, so it’s not something I really think about. I think that fact alone has been the biggest positive for me because I know how brutal cravings can be and they have gotten the best of me many times. That doesn’t mean that it’s not work, because it is, but this mindset has made things so much easier. If quitting is your only option, there’s not much else to do except move forward and know things will keep getting better.

Well tonight I woke up at 3:30 and my feet felt really still, I'd say even more than before kratom, it felt great. So I took my dose and fell asleep again and woke up at 8:00 AM with the feeling of groginess associated with dosing enough last night (from the times of heavy use) to not feel WD symptoms in the morning.

Gotta say, my WD symptoms are down to maybe 15% and I'm really happy. I don't care if it doesn't potentiate for me in the original sense, I just don't want the symptoms and I got that.

I'm taking gabapentin for the symptoms and by now it's helping a lot.  It helped in the beginning some but by now it's mostly taking away all my symptoms.  But for christ's sake my brain will not shut the fuck down.  I lay here and think of anything and everything.  It was something someone on this sub said about being a zombie on kratom that got me thinking.  It's like the shit shuts down your brain.  I wasn't engaging with anyone, including my wife, I wasn't into music as much as I normally am, I didn't really care about shit.  I just floated from dose to dose, counting the hours in between so I didn't take it too soon and make myself dizzy and throw up.  I was a zombie.  So I guess it makes sense that now that I'm off kratom by brain has woken up and is in hyper mode.  But though it's currently very much pissing me off, I believe it's a necessity.  Not all my thoughts are meaningless or random.  A lot of the thoughts keeping me up are about losses of relationships that have happened over the past 1.5 years due just not caring enough to call or hangout.  I think about conversations i want to have, apologies i want to make, sexy time with the wife, all the relationships with friends and family I've neglected during this time.  I text my dad today to tell him how much I love him and how much I appreciate his support through my fucking mess of a life.  Though these thoughts keep me awake, I believe they're critical to the healing process.  It's relationships that keep us healthy.  We're not solitary creatures, I know I'm not.  I DO NOT do well on my own.  I need and want people in my life.  So as pissed as I am to be laying here NOT sleeping, I'm glad my passion for people is coming back.

Addict in me just wants more . So I CT  it to day 5 some how . Just grinding through . Can’t get comfortable at all hating life and working also heavy Manuel labor . Garbage man type shit . I stop my route and call the specialist because I just can’t do it anymore. My opiate receptors were screaming at me . Tell the doctor how far I’ve made it she takes pity on me and prescribes me suboxone. I was really nervous about taking suboxone because it’s a bitch to get off of I’ve heard . But I was desperate. Once I got it I placed the suboxone under my tongue and within 10 min the aches pain depression slowly went away and I mean gone . I’ve been on suboxone for 6 weeks as the doctor recommended . In those 6 weeks I felt perfectly normal able to live life . When it was time to taper down I didn’t fuck around and tapered off the suboxone like the doctor told me too . I’m a week off suboxone, once I took my last small dose . The next day I did feel withdrawal from the suboxone but tolerable . Got better every day . A week out and I feel decent. If you’re suffering and can’t make it and think you’re gonna go back to kratom this might be an option  for you .

I didn't think I'd ever have my ""old"" mind back again. Today began with extreme anxiety upon awakening. Nothing new there. While addicted to kratom (25+ gpd) this had become the norm. Every possible horrible outcome riffled through like a deck of cards. Get the kratom! Well, now its Get the buspirone and gabapentin. This morning became this afternoon and some humor, some goodwill towards all man peeked through. This evening I feel more like myself for a change. I'll take it. Like any pink cloud, I'm sure it will fade, but I wanted to pass on: if you're in that ultra-miserable, cannot do this, when will it end, scary first multiple hours and days -- there's light just ahead.",8

Im around the 3 month clean mark maybe 100 days. I used on and off for a few years usually 30 days at 20 grams a day then taking a month off.  The seizure happened after I continued daily for two months. For the past 30 days I've been normal feeling.  Back to my old self with no sickness just 100% normal.  Then last Saturday BOOM!!!  I feel like I'm going to pass out.  The room doesn't spin just feel like I'm going to faint.  I was sick all day saturday and most of Sunday.  Worked yesterday and today but still get small waves of the I'm gonna faint feeling and it isnt as intense.  This feeling happened for a week straight after the seizure. Has anyone experienced this?

If you've been around here for a while, you've probably seen me post before.  I used to be super attentive to this sub and found it of great help during detox and paws.  Unfortunately as I got further away from my addiction, I slowly started letting myself feel responsible enough to take kratom again.  

I was buying vape juice when I randomly saw the extract shots.  I've only tried the shots maybe 3 times in all my days of kratom, and holy shit...it was amazing...even though a few times it made me sick and I threw up, I always had a great buzz. 

It's been about 3 weeks and I've taken 1-4 shots a day.  Today was the first day the all too familiar anxiety and depression hit me hard, and now I'm struggling to function, although its not as bad as my longer kratom addiction.  

Has anyone taken extract for about a month almost daily?  Am I fucked ha or is less than a month not long enough to develop a crazy dependence.  I know I'm psychologically fucked either way, but just lookin for some anecdotal reports as well as recommitting to my anti kratom ways.  

Thanks everyone.  Hope y'all have a great day.",9

Im hoping it’s PAWS and I can just power threw it but I quit my SSRI about 6 months ago also so I’m not sure. I’m an RN and as if work isn’t stressful enough with the pandemic I’m having bad anxiety for 12 hr a shift. Also the last few days is the first time I have actually considered going and buying Kratom again just to get me out the funk. I’m fully aware it’s a short term solution for a long term problem but the anxiety/depression is smothering me. I’ve been exercising and trying Wim Hof breathing but the effects only last a little while. Any advise? Does this sound like PAWS?,1

This Kratom is causing the worst panic and anxiety attacks.  about an hour after taking some i am so paranoic, doom and gloom.  I tried the powder to taper and I just don't have the discipline or self control to stick to it.  

Cold turky it must be.  6 to 7 weeks in at such high amounts i am expecting a decent level of being uncomfortable for a week or so.  I have gone through withdrawls off of other stuff and made it through, not sure why i cant just walk away from this as the side effects from this is killing me.  I read posts about how a lot of people say they feel better off kratom then they ever did on it.  I believe it.  Initially kraom helped me get going for the day.  Now it is causing so many problems.   

I have no choice but to show up to work so taking time off is not an option.  Its as if I wake up and forget that it harms me, forget the resolution and plans I wrote down the night before and go straight to getting more of this evil plant.  

For those that are new to using kratom please stop before it gets too late.  I am 6 to 7 weeks in and feel like it isnt possible and feel so trapped.  Any words of encouragement are welcomed.  Please.",2

I had quit before. I think some where in September. I remember being able to connect with people and make them laugh, I remember feeling like I was THERE, present with everyone else and I thought ""huh, this is pretty awesome! I feel happy for no reason"". Then some thing happened and I was so angry/sad I was in bed with my eyes closed saying ""I don't give a f\*\*\*, I am buying some tomorrow. F\*\*\* this. Tomorrow is kratom and video games f\*\*\* it all!"". Went to sleep, woke up and went to the kratom shop and fell once again.

&#x200B;

So it's December 1st. Thats 3 months, only in the past week I've noticed my social skills dwindled, I can barely focus on a conversation, I had no desire to talk to people and my work ethic plummeted. My boss knows I do some kind of drug, she doesn't know what it is. Lots of coworkers know I do SOME THING and make comments/jokes about OD'ing. They all know that I am a good guy and I think they just feel bad/worried for me and they feel awkward when they know I am high and I am around them. They try to act normal around me but I can see it in their faces they are looking for some thing in my eyes or the way I move. I can tell that they can tell some thing is.... off about me. So thinking hard about all of this I saw a post yesterday on this sub and it convinced me to quit cold turkey.

I was sitting outside reading about how much better peoples lives are after they quit. They can connect with people. They don't feel lazy. They're eyes don't look tired. The world is bright and amazing again and I said ""F\*!# it, I am throwing this away before I go back inside!"" So I walked towards the entrance and looked at the garbage can, thought about it too hard, and didn't do it... I tried to do some of my work but it kept bugging me ""Am I really this weak? why can't I just throw it away?"" I paced a little, really upset at myself, did some work, thought about it a little more, and eureka! The courage! ""Hey, Jared I am going to the restroom really quick"" so I kinda speed walk to the bathroom and into the nearest open stall, rip that green sack of evil out of my pocket and without hesitation, opened it and dumped it into the toilet and flushed. SO PROUD OF MYSELF! I wanted to cry. I felt so good after doing that, the entire day I was miserable up until I threw my kratom away. I all of a sudden had a pep in my step, I felt awake, I felt happy and I felt like I could think clearer like.. because my thoughts about when I am going to dose next were gone I had room to think about other things. Went home ecstatic that day. Got home, got out of my car, took a deep breath and looked at the moon, it gave me goose bumps it was like...magic... it feels like I just got out of a dark hole, I thought: ""when was the last time I looked up at the moon? its beautiful"" I really felt like I was in darkness or did not care to look at reality/nature. Kratom numbed me from the beauty of the world and I hate it for that. I have always loved people, nature, the moon, the stars and how dare I let it take that away from me. It is now the next day and I feel fine. Slight RLS when I tried to sleep but my overall mood is OK except when I died in EFT earlier it really pissed me off so I am trying to stay away from games and focus on breathing or watching educational videos. I am never going back. I cannot wait to be 100%!!

Thank you all! If it wasn't for this subreddit I wouldn't have quit when I did. Love to all of you!",4

I still think about K, everyday, at random times, I think my brain is not fully healed yet because I get into the depressed state sometimes, usually evenings,, but Im so determined I know I wont do it again, also writing my thoughts here really helps me stay on track.

I started doing the breathing exercises and taking cold showers beginning the second week into my kratom quit, when I was really struggling, especially with sleep. I've continued daily, often more than once a day, ever since.

In addition to it's claimed long-term benefits, I've always found WHM to produce IMMEDIATE RESULTS. After all, isn't that what we addicts seek... to just feel *something*... or in many cases, not feeling something... or anything at all (aka: numb)? Regardless, it seems that it's that immediate ""relief"" that we seek. When I think back to my kratom usage, that's exactly what it was like for me. Anxiety? Take kratom. Pissed at the spouse? Take kratom. Pain? You guessed it. And on and on and on.

I think this psyche is one of the reasons why so many of us struggle with quitting and staying quit. It takes TIME for the mind and body to heal. We hate waiting! We're always looking for that next ""quick fix"".

If you've not tried Wim Hof Method, give it a try before you prejudge and disqualify yourself. As with anything, everyone is different and it may not be for you. But I do notice that the vast majority of folks on this sub who've given it a fair try, love it and praise it. I believe, in my experience, that's because it works. In my opinion and experience, you will feel ""something"" IMMEDIATELY. 10-minute instructional videos can be found on YouTube in various languages by searching ""Wim Hof Method breathing"".",7

I used Kratom for about 3 years and worked up to about 30-40gpd. I didn't use the scale so the 30g was the lowest dose I estimated by weighing out the teaspoons, so it could have been more, I just dosed as I felt like it, about 4-7 times a day.

I started with the estimate of 30gpd, cut it by 30% to 20gpd and since day 1 I take off 0,5g of the total dose daily. So all in all I should be Kratom free by 1/8/2021. Compared to CT it's managable and what really surprised me is that I, wait for it.... sleep about 6-7 hours a night. What really helps me with the sleep is that I dose 4 times a day (6:00, 12:00, 18:00, and the key dose is when I wake up twitching at night I just take a dose straight away and I fall asleep within 40 minutes and sleep till the alarm goes off - that is a godsend my fellow junkies.

Now my question is, has anyone done this style of taper here? I mean the linear version. The standard is taking steps and then adjust. I take off 0,5g a day every day and so far so good about a quarter of a way down.

And if you did so, did you encounter a problematic dosage at which you had trouble?

I'm currently on day 8 of a ct detox for what must be the 100th time.  My life's been a mess since I found opiates.  I've had to kick heroin, suboxone, fentanyl and kratom, and I will tell you that the hardest drug I've ever had to give up is kratom.  So the wds aren't as bad, sure, but the struggle not to pick it up again is astounding.  When we lay on the couch miserable with wd symptoms, constantly every second knowing that with a few bucks, fuck even spare change you could scrounge up, you can drive prob less than 5 miles to a gas station and in a very short time the overwhelming sadness, the grief, the pain, the fucking agony of the wd symptoms are gone.  You'll sit on your couch and wait for all the badness to slowly fade away.  Kratom is another type of beast.  It's a legal beast.  It's a cheap beast.  It's a beast that's in your face every fucking time you enter a gas station.  I stopped shooting dope bc it destroyed my life.  Viciously.  Shooting dope is no longer an option.  But with kratom it can take years to finally realize what it's taking from you.  It's not going to mess things up.  You won't loose your job bc you can't work bc you can't score that day.  People won't see you nodding out and know your high.  You'll take your kratom and have a great day.  You'll work harder, you'll be happier.  I swear to god I've never struggled this hard with a drug.  I don't have to hit up the dope man and hope he's holding.  Or come up with 50$ to get high.  I can run to the gas station with less than 10$ and feel great.  And it's not going to fuck my life up, things aren't going to fall to pieces, I'm not going to go broke or overdose and die.  It's just going to slowly rot me from the inside out.  It's cheap, it's easy to get, and no one knows a fucking thing.  I believe after 20 years of drug use that kratom takes the cake for the hardest drug to kick.  So with all that said, just know that all you guys that are beating your kratom addictions, you're fucking badasses.  Your champions.  You have an iron will and what you've done is a big deal.  A huge deal.  I'll be more proud to have 1 year off kratom than I am for the 7 years I have off heroin.  So you guys that are struggling like me, just know this ain't no walk in the park.  You're fighting a battle with the odds stacked against you.  But that doesn't mean you won't win.  Good luck to all of you.",95
