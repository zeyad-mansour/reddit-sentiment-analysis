Working 75 hours a week while dealing with all this.,"This is my third time trying to quit... Two times in the past I made it about two weeks and I had virtually no negative symptoms because I was taking phenibut to deal with the lack of sleep and the bad feelings. So by the time the withdrawal is over now I was chemically addicted to phenibut. From there I would use Kratom to deal with the with draws from that of that. Created a vicious cycle. I decided to break the phenibut had it first as it is so much worse. I’ve been clean from that for about two months and I am officially trying to get off both altogether and for good. Today is day two. I slept like absolute shit. I feel unfathomably tired and mentally so detached from any positive emotions. I work six days a week and work almost 75 hours a week at a very high energy job so this is hell. My career where for the next three months I have to be at absolute peak performance, a massive promotion rides on the line which would double my pay and more than cut my hours in half. I cannot miss this so I have to be strong through this time period. I considered prolonging the withdrawal and tapering but I know my mind and unless I conquer this here and now I won’t at all. I have no days off left. Doing my absolute best to let my wife not have any idea that I am withdrawing from any drugs. She is very clean-cut and would be super disappointed and I don’t want to do that to her because that would make my mental state that much worse. I have been taking about 25 to 30 g a day for about a year and a half. In the years before that I would take it for maybe two months on and then stop without even noticing and never suffered one bit. This is quite noticeably different.
I just need help and support to get through this so I made a throwaway account.

I've been doing a slow benzo taper as well.  I'm jumping off the benzos around Christmas.  I'm currently at a low dose of that as well.  Most people would have jumped by now but I get massive, horrible headaches that last days when I taper quicker.  I mostly was taking kratom to help my benzo situation.  I had no clue kratom would double my problems. 

So, I had a silicone ear plug get suctioned into my ear last week and I hurt my ear pulling it out. I felt a pop.  My ear hurt, hearing was muted, and my ear felt numb and turned off.  If I yawn nothing happens in that side now.  Pain behind my ear, but not much and my neck started getting stiff.  I went to an ENT last week and everything was in normal limits and they said to wait a few weeks.  

Depressed and my psychiatrist has given up on me taking any SSRI's because I have hardcore side effects. I've tried so many meds. He prescribed Concerta a few weeks ago.  I've taken it a few times, it helps decrease pain and anxiety a ton but yesterday went crappy with depression. Yesterday, about an hour after I took it I started getting twitching in that jaw, my face feels tingley, shoulder and neck hurt. I'm sure it's related to my ear.  I kinda wonder if I broke an ear bone? I get dizzy laying in bed now and feel like I'm falling off the bed.  So, my senses are kinda messed up. 

Mentioning SI to my husband now isn't a big deal anymore it's gone on for so long now.  I'm frigging miserable and in pain daily for months.  I haven't slept normally in 2 years because of benzos, I've only taken them as prescribed and in low doses.  I stopped Seroquel several months ago and had withdrawals from that.  I haven't fully recovered.

I'm pretty much at my limit and don't know what to do. I've taken low doses of all these things and nothing works and my body just rejects everything now after a day or two.  

Any suggestions?  Stopping kratom seemed to help me mentally for a while with the return of some clarity and emotions but now everything is just kinda messed up. I'm tired of constantly trying to figure out what is causing what and each day being a new type of torture.   

I realize I just need to let my body heal but I'm constantly at my tolerance of physical and mental pain.  Feeling crappy.  Please be kind and no tough love.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.798477}"

New to reddit, but i have something i would like to share given how well it has been working for me. A couple months ago i decided to quit kratom but didn't want to do it cold turkey. So what i did was the following (keep in mind I am still detoxing), and for some context i would take 13g at a time about 4 or 5 times a day.

I started by ordering a microgram scale off of amazon.

Then i figured out how much i would take at any given dose (since i never really was all that precise about my doses before this.) My dose ended up being around 13g at a time.

What i decided to do then was drop my dose by 0.1g each day. So Monday was 13g all day, then Tuesday was 12.9g all day, then Wednesday was 12.8g all day, and so on.

This is the entirety of my system. I thought i would reach a point where my body started experiencing withdrawals even with such small incremental reductions, but the great news is (for me at least) I WAS WRONG!!!

This is groundbreaking for me since i assumed my detox was going to be full of pain and discomfort no matter how i decided to do it, but i have successfully brought myself down to 8g a day without even the slightest withdrawals!

So my point in posting this is simple. If you have a few months to spare before you need to get off Kratom, or are just looking to get off of it in general, yes it is going to take some time, but this is so easy and painless.

I am in no way saying that it is going to stay this way for me, but it is looking really good for me at the same time.

I simply wanted to give some hope to people out there who may be struggling with this addiction/dependence the same way that i am. 

You can get off of it and it doesn't have to be as bad as all the withdrawal websites make it sound. There is hope and i hope that i have given that to a few who read this.

I will ideally be posting updates to say if i do experience any withdrawals in the future, but for the time being i wish the best to those in this uncomfortable position.",16,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.611599}"

Every time I quit, I just spend hours on here, worrying about everything like insomnia, how I'm gunna get through this. During the acutes, I feel like I can conquer it because of my absolute hatred of kratom. Then real life begins and I fail. after 2 weeks, a month, a couple of months. If you could define me in one word, it would be the word Relapse. Ugghh. 

I know I need therapy. I know I need to tackle my lifelong insomnia without substances. I know I have a deep sense of fear from everything and need to work on it. Even with therapy, I promise myself I would do it, but then I fear the ""addict"" label that will follow me throughout my career. I convince myself that I can do it by myself, which I've proven over and over again that I cannot. I promise myself to go to meetings, but then I break these promises. 

I used to be social. I used to have a lot of friends. As I've gotten older, friends disappear which is natural, but this isolation because of kratom really did a number on me. The insomnia is my main fear, it has always been there, but now I am looking into CBT-I for it. I know I have to work on myself immensely to ever get over my shit issues and nothing will change if nothing changes. But I've quit kratom so many times that I have all the proof I need that I cannot do it myself, and I really need to tackle this head on.

I guess I'm just overwhelmed. I have so many huge life changes in the next month, and just the thought of battling insomnia to a new job, have no drug crutches scares the living shit out of me. I have to learn a completely different life that I just don't know how to live. I am going cold turkey tomorrow from a relatively big habit, but I've quit larger habits too. 

Questions for Pro quitters:

Any advice on how to get over this damn fear of everything? People, places, new responsibilities, and living life sober? 

Also, if you go to a therapist and get labeled with substance abuse disorder, will it follow you everywhere on your medical records? 

I've also been taking a new strain, white borneo. I've never withdrawn from this strain. I know reds have a more opiate like withdrawal, but what's the difference from a white strain withdrawal? None really?

Even after going CT in a hospital for 6 days, I'd come back home and immediately purchase an expensive extract. It always made me feel better.

Now I'm 15 days free of that shit and going on 2 days free of subs, too. I keep a bottle of the extract on my desk to remind me it's always an option, but don't I want an iced coffee instead? Or maybe I should go for a walk. Anything but take that super easy option. I even had a super shitty day today and decided... you know what, I'm just going to get a coffee and cookie for dinner because I feel like I deserve it, and I'm actually not that hungry anyway.

It's not always an option to get these expensive extracts, and I can't get another bottle because I actually am putting money into savings (whoa I know.) But if it's right there, I can remind myself that if I do take that option, I'm never going to again, so I should do something else because I'm just going to hurt and really hate life later.

Today WAS shitty, but also very productive... the brain fog is starting to wear off and I can type without a bunch of errors and I can make phone calls where people aren't saying ""huh? I can't understand you"" all the time.

Day 5: 0 grams

2019-10-28 12:09:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/doay83/my_story_taper_plan_and_seeking/,"My Story, taper plan, and seeking advice/encouragement!","Hi everyone, as my title states I'm here to share my story with kratom addiction. I'd also love any advice that can help me throughout the process.

A year ago, October 2018 is when I found out about kratom. My friend told me about how great it was for his anxiety. I will say, the main reason I took it and still take it to this day was because of my anxiety. It's always been a bigger issue than I was willing to admit to myself. I started out only taking a few grams at a time, and I loved it! I thought I found this magical, pretty safe powder that was the cure to my anxiety! The euphoria was amazing, and it gave me incredible focus and warmth. That being said, like many others, I began to chase the dragon. My dose went higher and higher as I felt the effects less and less, and I didn't realize how much of a problem this was until it spiraled out of control. I started just by taking it at work, it made the day go faster, and actually made being a cashier fun. Eventually, it led to me taking it all day. I love using it when I played video games, and I began enjoying it doing anything.

Fast forward, at the end of this past April I decided I wanted to taper. Cold turkey sounded too scary. I'm 23 years old, and was heading home for a few weeks after finishing school for the semester. At this time, I was taking around 30-35gs a day. I managed to cut this down to around 20g a day in around 7-10 days before going home. I noticed a few things with this taper, kratom began to work better again, and I also just felt less cloudy and out of it. I intended on continuing the taper, but once I got back to school in May I spiraled even more. The kratom began working better, and I fell into the trap of chasing the dragon once again. Since May, I've been taking around 40-50g a day.

Now here we are today. 4 days ago I decided I wanted to taper again, but this time with the intention of quitting. I've accepted and noticed how much kratom is negatively effecting my life. My whole day is based around taking kratom, and I HATE it. I only eat 1-2 meals a day because withdrawals kick in if I each too much. I find myself swirling between feeling awful because my dose is wearing off, or feeling like a zombie because the amount I need it too high. I feel like I don't hangout with my friends as much, kratom has crushed my motivation to do anything that isn't required of me. I often feel like I'm in just such a weird head space as well, kinda like I'm not very grounded in things. The list goes on, I WANT TO FEEL AGAIN. I'm tired of burying my emotions. Sometimes I get nostalgic and think about how life felt before kratom, and I want that again. I want to work on my anxiety in a healthy way.

The taper is going well so far, and I've already noticed lots of improvements in the past 4-5 days! I'm currently down to 28-30g a day. My schedule is currently taking 6-7g in the morning when I wake up, and 5g after my first meal. The rest of the day I take between 2-3g at a time every 2-3 hours. I have been trying to cut back around .5-1g a day. I've found myself feeling more connected to things again, and much less cloudy headed. My emotions are slowly creeping out more and more.

Thank you for reading my story! I'd love to hear some advice on how ya'll are doing or have done with your taper process! How did you feel once you completed the taper? Do withdrawals stick around much after you cut down to a low enough amount to quit? Are there are SAFE and non-addicting supplements that can help me? I'd also love to hear how you are feeling now that you've quit? Please share anything :) Thanks!",2,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.7057272}"

No RLS, just tough to get comfortable. W/D + Lithium = Diarrhea. I'm drinking a ton of water, plus occasional salt water and Gatorade.

The good: I've been on gabapentin for my bipolar and RLS, and 6 days into Lithium strictly for my bipolar. My experience the past two day has been: 

\*Feeling strong emotions. (WTF are those?) Both good and bad ones, but comfortable, not like ""OMG I want to die"".

\*Motivation. I've put in more work on Sunday and this AM than I typically do in a work week.

\*Music sound frigging amazing, Alexa has been putting in work the past two days

\*I'm ready to get creative again. Pick up the paintbrush and the guitar.

\*I'm starting to formulate how I'm going to make amends to those I've harmed over my adult life. Not just from Kratom, but from my undiagnosed bipolar disorder. I caused a lot of pain and sadness, for myself and everyone who was unfortunate enough to get entwined with me.

I was going to sell my two unopened kilos of Kratom to a local head shop. Screw it, I'll consider the loss of \~170.00 worth of green sludge as paying the piper. I had thrown out all my open stuff, but it really killed me to dump that much product. In the end if I sell it I'm just contributing to someone else ending up here someday, if they are lucky. Besides throwing it away means I'm confident enough to finally go through life without the safety net. My biggest problem is sleep, and the strain I still have is what I always used for it.

I have gone through Hell quitting before and other times it has seemed effortless.  I'm not overly bothered by the physical symptoms.  I hate RLS but it eventually gets better.

I know this because of the way she treated me when I needed help with alcohol addiction.  I am alone and terrified.

I've quit so many times. The self-hatred, the lurking and commenting on this sub for YEARS has left me in utter shambles. 

I've gotten so good at withdrawals that I have it down to science in terms of prescribed meds. It isn't that bad actually because I'm a drug addict, although the meds are prescribed. Then I get weed, and it all comes full circle to me thinking it isn't that bad, then the pain and bullshit ensues. The cycle of hell I put myself through the past years by focusing on quitting kratom has not worked.

I have an opportunity to completely change everything about my shit life I've had for years due to kratom isolation, the depression, and self-hatred. The constant addiction to escaping life and not dealing with it has left me as an adult with no coping skills, no confidence, and completely behind in life. 

I just don't know how to live life sober, and I know it is the only answer for me. I've tried so many times to switch to something ""non-addictive"", like weed, but we all know what happens. I just start using weed like I used kratom. I always have this craving for something to escape. I simply do not know how to deal with life. I thought I had ADHD, and got prescribed adderall.  I never binge on it, I just use it at a lower dose, but it does the same shit that all drugs do. It takes my soul. 

I am going to quit kratom for the 100+ time tomorrow, using prescribed meds, and get off of those within 5-7 days. How the hell do I stay completely sober? I want it so bad, but then I go into autopilot with any substance to take me out of my mind. I don't want to be on adderall, weed, alcohol, but my brain and reward center is so fucked up now. I feel like it is impossible, and I will be white-knuckling for my whole life. I know I need this, but I dont know how to do it. Kratom is the worst drug for me, nothing has stolen as much as it has from me. Im just so depressed by how I lived my life, but I have no confidence that I can do it. The daily grind, no escape, how do normies do life? 

Any advice would be appreciated. I tried meetings, but never fully committed to doing like a 90 meetings in 90 days thing. I think this is the next step. I just have no confidence in myself. It's like I know I will fail. I expect failure because that is all I've done the past 5 years in terms of quitting and everything else in life. I know I'm being harsh on myself, but this is reality. I'm not gunna hide behind some kratom veil that says I'm doing great, because I certainly am not doing well. 

Anyways, thanks for reading. Anyone get completely sober after always finding the escape from life for years? I definitely have the addict gene. Am I fucked for life? I know different things work for different people, but if anyone is a huge addict in general, would love to know what you did. No rehab possible due to time and change in life.

Here we go again for 1000x time. So fucking sick of the cycle, but after a while, I want to use again and again. I hate who I am. Any successful drug addicts/escape artists get off of all drugs? What did you do? How did you keep with it?",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8736445}"

(3 Months) First time poster.,"Hello to this wonderful community. Best regularly occurring substance-abuse meeting I've been to and I hit the rooms of AA in 1991-- my home group was terrific, so that's saying something. Have wanted to post or respond a thousand times. Couldn't get the nerve and couldn't figure out how, anyway. (I just noticed the blue 'POST"" button over on the right. Jesus, what a putz.)

I'm not sure what will happen when I hit the ""POST"" button down below so I'm gonna be brief as possible. Been using for a year this October. Plain leaf supreme powder. By February I knew I had been dabbling with the Devil's own hybrid of poison ivy. Coffee, my ass. Got up to 40 gpd briefly, only a few times. Spent 2 months cranking that down. Spent a couple months in the 30's. June and August was mostly mid-20's but using a heaping one-gram scoop. So who knows. Upper 20's anyway. By August, I knew I had to get serious about tapering. I did and failed right off the bat. All month long. September rolls around with the understanding that it's gonna take a much stronger effort on my part. I knuckled down and switched to caps, among several other strategic ideas. More spectacular failure, but I had a couple good weeks. By October I was a seasoned loser, but this sub kept my spirits up. I kept going and accepting the failures with gratitude because with all those dashed hopes and missed goals, I got my daily usage down into the high-teens for August and mid-teens for September (when calculated by the month). I'm on target to be 13 or 14 this month with many days at 12 gpd. I AM ECSTATIC for this. And I'm not suffering. Well, I am, but its because of the use, not the non-use. This shit takes everything from you, as you all know. What an extraordinary poison this is. Steals things that shouldn't be able to be stolen. You don't even realize it till they're long gone. Then, you don't even recognize what's gone, only that you're a small percentile of the person you were ... as is your life.

Just wanted to encourage other tapers out there to accept the failures. They all go into your quitting-pot and add to your recovery. As my sponsor said to me last night, ""You, need everyday of your quit. It's all necessary. It all is playing a part that you may not see.""

This is way too long. Sorry. Just some facts, now. Dosing 3x4g a day. First is 7:30 AM. Last is 1:00 PM. I have nearly no trouble going 18 hours between last and first dose. Been doing that for 3 months. Only poor motivation and listlessness--but isn't that all but an hour or two of our lives on K  at this point anyway? (depression too btw).

Prior to this I hadn't made it longer than 60 days(usually 30) in my prior attempts, I don't know what happened this time other than my mentality changed. It was finally a do or die moment. I was helpless - physically, I could barely walk my dogs, I wasn't eating and I looked like a ghost. Mentally, I was in worse shape, crying every day - unable to handle anything. My life had fallen apart - no job, crazy debt, house/car about to be taken and my marriage was falling apart. 

I decided I was willing to do or endure whatever it took to get out of the place I  was in - I didn't care if I was looking at 60 days of acute withdrawal - bring it!! 

If there is one thing I learned and it came after some time is that I didn't give a fuck about myself - I lost every battle when it came to me. I never put myself first, I never tried, I never applied myself.

3 months sober I started to get some mental clarity and really get a look at the damage done, the gravity of the situation I was in, the decisions I made. It was terrifying, I realized it was ME that did all this, it didn't matter what wrongs were done to me, I had a choice, I made a choice and every time I made the choice to put myself 2nd or last. I was a piece of shit - and I forgave myself. 

It get's mentioned on here a lot but the anxiety I started to experience a few weeks after acutes was so bad I literally had to go to the gym - I started going everyday because it was/is the only way to deal with the anxiety.

I know a lot of the threads on this sub are related to withdrawal and reducing withdrawal symptoms and that's understandable. I found that the real challenges for me didn't start until a few weeks after acutes and I still fight some of them today. I have to keep reminding myself that 13 years of getting fucked up doesn't change overnight. 

I want to be someone who leads through example - I have been hesitant to share because I don't want to feel like I'm just running my mouth. I set a goal at the beginning of this year to run a sub 6 minute mile - it's the only goal I set and I figured if I can accomplish that I would be in pretty good shape overall. I'm committing to following up on this thread with my time - whatever it is.

10/20. Day 1: Didn't start having bad withdrawls until 12hrs after my last dose. (12am Monday morning) RLS, the whole works. 2hrs of sleep MAYBE. 

10/21. Day 2: Heavy brain fog, no emotions, no pleasure from anything, zero energy and time just dragged by. Same amount of sleep as last night. Couldn't tell if the meds from the doctor did anything. It took a massive amount of willpower just to get off the couch. Tried a small dose of Lope w/grapefruit juice to see if it'd make even the slightest difference. Nope. 

10/22. Day 3: Could notice a slight difference in how I felt mentally. I felt a glimmer of hope, thinking that how I felt would steadily improve day by day. I was wrong. Got pissed off at the RLS when I went to sleep and ended up drinking down 4 beers just to fall asleep. Huge mistake. Woke up after a couple hours, sick. 

10/23. Day 4. Spent most of the day with my stomach feeling like shit because of the beer. Very hazy headed. Constant anxiety. Heavy heartbeat. Forcing myself to eat.  I have zero appetite. Living off of bananas and cereal mostly because they're easy. Same amount of sleep. 

10/24. Day 5. My head feels a bit more clear. Not alot, but some. Not as lethargic either. Finally left the house to run to the store 4 blocks away. Felt extremely weird being around people. Same anxiety level. Finally didnt have RLS. No tingling, just straight up tossing and turning. Same 2-3hrs of total sleep. 

10/25. Start of day 6. Extremely anxious all day. The worst day yet as far as anxiety goes. Could feel my heart beating all day. No supplements helped. Aquired 2 .25mg Xanax. A one time deal as I dont have access to more. This evening was the best ive felt since I stopped. Atleast I had a handful of hours, anxiety free and calm. I thought Id sleep great. Nope. Woke up after 2.5hrs and I was pissed.  Been having some GI issues since the lope. Keeps me from getting comfortable and sleeping at night. Took big doses of magnesium citrate and vitamin c to clear my bowels, 2 days in a row. It made me have diherrea as desired but it didnt get rid of the uncomfortable pressure I feel in my gut. It's extremely annoying. Anyone else have this issue? 

Technically start of day 7 started at noon today. This morning I was feeling extremely depressed. The worst day for that yet. Flooded with sad emotions. Was holding back tears for a few hours. Still forcing myself to eat otherwise my stomach feels like a black hole but sometimes when I do eat, I feel really nauseous. Almost puked when I forced myself to eat a snack in the middle of the night the last 2 nights. Not feeling  as depressed as this morning.

    I did a 90 day taper, got a ton of supplements, and I went from 40gpd to 2gpd, to zero.  during my 3 weeks of total sobriety I still had work and 2 toddlers to raise and a husband who was not very supportive especially when he is angry. in any case I attempted church with him, and meetings on my own but I didn't have a babysitter so I started reading books and running at night, cold showers , I was feeling alot of things. depression was awful, I remember feeling so overwhelmed with my own thoughts, I remember finding some old white vein and after a argument about something trivial with my husband on the phone I took some and felt awesome but I felt guilty as well. during my quit my acne cleared up and I was sleeping good, I had no appetite but looking back I was trying to do it on my own so hard. but I just didn't have a single person to lean on and so here I am over a year later. now I am separated and live in my own house across the highway from him and we still work opposite of eachother to maintain our finances without childcare.  I feel alot stronger living without being scared of him everyday and i have learned alot about myself since I left in February. I have also been depressed all year long, every single day I am sad about being alone, and the nights ( Sundays ) I dont have my kids I'm all in my head about negative thoughts, I have started to think since I'm healing now I wanna actually heal, I don't wanna numb it all I wanna get the hell over this breakup, even if it takes months I know I can't get involved with anyone until I get my issues under control. I feel like I am stuck in a cycle of bad moods. it sucks.  any advice is welcomed. thanks for taking the time to read my shit show of a story lol  I'm currently at about 18-20grams per day I was doing 4 - 5gram doses per day and yesterday and today I took that down to 4.5 grams.. before these past couple weeks I had no desire to quit but my hair is thin as hell and I am bitchy when I take it.

Does anyone have any tips how to deal with feeling cold during withdrawals (PAWS?)?
I guess other than layers of clothes and high frequency hot showers there's not much that can be done?
Does ibuprofen help at all? I seem to recall people mentioning it occasionally.
------------------------------------

So I've done several kratom withdrawals in the past. And usually I've felt okay by day 10.

This one was different, but also complicated by the fact that I took a huge amount of an RC benzo (the doctors told me I was suicidal, I don't remember anything), and 2 days later an ""overdose"" of an RC dissociative which left me in a catatonic state. 

Anyway, I got admitted to the ICU (a bit overkill imho, I think I'd have been fine had they just left me to sober up) for about a night, and then to the psych ward to begin my unintentional kratom wd.
I was using about 10 gpd before withdrawing in the psych ward.

The first few days I hardly felt symptoms, and thought ""this is amazing!"". Well, I was wrong. After like 3 days, it got worse, plus the benzo withdrawal started coming on slowly.
I usually didn't sleep more than 1-4 hrs a night, even though I got given high doses of doxepin, promethazine, and other antipsychotics, and later on zopiclone. 

To get to the point though. I'm on day ten, and managed to get out of that hell hole, and am back home (have no access to kratom, and now that I've come that far, the unintentional wd turned into a more intentional one).

For the first few days I felt really hot and sweaty most of the time, but ever since I've had less and less sleep, I've just been feeling cold/chilly all day. And it's not the same as cold chills when you have acute withdrawal.

TIA for any input.

I’m sleeping light, but sleeping. I don’t feel like a zombie in the mornings. Emotionally... different story. SO anxious when I’m in the context in which I used (nighttime, when I’m trying to wind down). 

I’m waiting for the physical stuff to start. Or maybe it won’t? I was tossing and washing almost every night for 2 years. Wasn’t until the last year that I don’t even know what my intake was. At least 20-30gpd (mind you I only weigh 135lbs). I found out I was pregnant and immediately stopped for, idk, a couple days. Then I started rationalizing. Oh, if I’m only taking 4-6gpd it won’t cause any harm. Plus it takes the edge off the anxiety and it’s worse for the baby to be anxious right?? So that’s what I’d been doing up until 3 nights ago. 

So disgusted with myself. Never thought I’d be the person to put something in my body when I have no idea what it’s doing to my baby. Haven’t taken a sip of alcohol. Following all of the dietary rules. I’m terrified that I’ve hurt her. 

It all came down to my husband saying, “If there’s something wrong with her, we’re done and I’m taking her.” Why did it have to come to that for me to stop???

Anyways. Again, because of the pregnancy, I’m not taking any other supplements to help me so I’m just a mess of anxiety and craving at night. Clearly that’s what really drove this in the first place. I’ll talk to my doctor my next appointment and see if there’s something safe that can help me. I’m 4 months pregnant by the way — all checkups and screens have been normal so far.

Whenever he leaves, I stay at my neighbors house. I swear my house is haunted, and being there alone at night puts me into a knee-jerk ptsd response. However, that's not what this post is about.

I've been here before. Yearning for freedom, and as much control of my life as I can. The last few months have been worse than usual. My usage was causing delusion, psychosis, hallucinations, and uncontrollable rage. Enough is enough. I've just been looking for a way out. That way appeared on monday. My weekly responsibility, one that I had to show up looking clean and sober for, was over. I have the opportunity to disappear for a week or two. In addition, staying with my neighbor, I can stay in bed all day, and not arouse any suspicion. 

So far, I've been taking advantage of this. I'm only 27 hours in, but that's a long time for me. It feels different this time around. My resolve seems to be there. I don't spend much time missing kratom, like I usually do. Though I've almost caved, my resolve has guided me away each time.

I've been sleeping. Using gabapentin (I'm prescribed it for other reasons) and marijuana edibles to ride out the worst of it. So far, I feel good. The most unbearable effect has been my heart, jumping around in spells of arythmia. I already feel my emotions, and like the haze that was preventing me from being myself is fading away. I don't know what the next few days have in store for me. I hope I will stay strong.

The main issue I'm fighting is cravings. Basically two days of cravings. Some minor sneezing and headaches, but no chills like when I stopped 3 weeks ago. Emotions all over the place, but i'm handling that okay, and that's also related to my dad passing away two weeks ago. Already doing better at work than I had been lately while using kratom. I always took most, if not all, of my daily kratom in the mid to late evening, then this wold keep me awake unhealthily late for my early work shift. I'm actually getting to bed on time and sleeping enough to have productive days. 

so yeah, just the damn cravings, and not liking the thought of never doing kratom again. I believe it's harder to get in Canada than in the states, I order online but the site I used can get it to me the next day if I'm willing to pay the priority shipping. So after all I craved yesterday, and today too, there's something to be said for the fact that I chose not to do that order, meaning my quit will continue for the weekend. Previous quits I relapsed from these cravings, just like ""Fuck it, if I want it that bad I may as well get some."" Also, for me kratom caused veins to pop out on one of my feet and legs. Those already seem to be getting a bit smaller. I had no idea those were caused by kratom until previous quit attempts.

The weird part is, when I first tried kratom ten years ago i didn't care for it. Around 7 years ago, as life got busier, I found myself wanting something that would really zone out the stress for me every night, rather than overdoing it on beer and weed, and I returned to kratom. and the rest is history.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.44597587}"

Yesterday was the first day I’ve gone without kratom for several months, and that was only because I was hospitalized for about a week, so it’s been much longer than that. You’d think that after I got out of the hospital, with eight days clean from kratom (and vaping for that matter), that I’d view it as a head start and run with it. But we all know it’s more complicated than that, and it requires a voluntary desire to change our lives. Maybe sobriety can be forced on some people, but not me. 

I was supposed to jump off the day before, but I had a breakdown and couldn’t do it. Then I had another breakdown after doing some, wondering if I was completely trapped with no will power to actually stop. 

So I woke up yesterday with a new resolve to make it through the day. I work from home so I was able to stay busy, but working from home can present its own problems too, since I’m so used to doing kratom all day while I work. 

Late afternoon, it started to get real. The rest of the night I had the usual physical withdrawal symptoms. Lack of energy set in, but I still forced myself to go to the gym and do some light cardio for a half hour. I came home and took a shower, and no matter how much I dried myself off after, I couldn’t stop sweating through the shirts I put on. I went through two before I said screw it and went shirtless for awhile until it died down. It was a mental struggle too, but once it got past the hour where I’d even be able to go buy any, my fate was sealed and I accepted it. 

The only thing that took me by surprise on day one was that RLS set in with some force. In my past opioid detox experiences, that didn’t happen until at least the third night. Same thing at the hospital several months ago. Maybe it’s the amount I’ve been taking (50+ gpd, sometimes upwards of 70-80). 

But I finally fell asleep, and I slept for 9-10 hours. I have a bottle of Seroquel that they prescribed after my hospital stay that I never used but held onto. That stuff knocks me out. I’m not sure if it’ll help with insomnia that usually sets in after a few days, but I’m hoping so. 

Then today I woke up feeling like garbage but I forced myself to get out for awhile. While I was driving home, I had a brief moment of happiness unlike I’d felt in a long time - a fleeting glimpse of how I’m going to feel when this runs it’s course. I know that those moments are fools gold and that the journey is just beginning, but still, they’re really nice to have, if only for a minute.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.51452386}"

At first I thought it was my miracle herb. I went from 2 tsp 2x/day to 2tsp 4-5x/day over the course of the last 2 years. At first it lifted my moods during the day and helped me sleep at night. Well about 3 weeks ago it started having the opposite effect on me than it usually does. I started getting anxiety, started losing sleep then became completely sleepless FOR 6 DAYS. I knew it was kratom because every time I would take a dose I could hear this ringing in my head and feel my level of alertness grow. I was a complete mess because during this time I COULD NOT sleep or eat. I also was trying to stop using kratom because I knew it was making it worse but the withdrawals got me everytime. I tapered over the 6 day period as I slowly was losing my mind from not being able to sleep. On Wed, the 7th day of no sleep I just stopped because I felt like I was going to die. I suffered through the withdrawals which were complete hell. Today is day 15 no kratom and I'm still unable to sleep. I have a horrible ringing sound in my head still.

Still in withdrawal, wanting to start modafinil soon, but when?","Hi everyone, After about 2 years of very much changing doses, I now finally am about to stop taking it completely.

I already tapered after strong use for a years time, done a few months ago, then maintaining but upping slowly up to 20 grams/day until a week ago. I could have quit already by now, but the reason I did not is that i'm starting a business, and I really couldn't use the withdrawals like low energy and depression. But I still wanted to get rid of my use(since this business will take months to setup I figured), so I tapered to about 2gr/day now (over 6 doses). About clean. However I'm far from withdrawal free, since this last taper was really fast for me.

The reason I did this fast taper was also that I want to try Modafinil. Not related to this subreddit, I know, but since kratom contains so many alkaloids, I didn't want to risk any dangerous interactions. And that makes it relevant for my situation.

I now want to start modafinil as soon as possible, since my energy is at a deep low at the moment, and I'm still having a headache from the kratom withdrawal. And I just want to be productive again.

My question is; if I want to play it really safe, should I wait a few more days for all the kratom to leave my system, BUT risk relapse bigtime because this just isn't pleasant, or maybe take a last bigger dose this night before bed (to get rid of the headache) and start with a well rested head with the modafinil tomorrow?

Will the modafinil just take over the serotonin/dopamine absence, or will this withdrawal still be there even while on moda, and possibly negatively effect that experience? Or will it make my kratom withdrawals easier/go away? I want to try modafinil anyway!

For approximately the past 15 years I've been addicted to primarily alcohol and opiates.  It has never gone out of control, I've simply kept the beast tame over time.  In early 2017 I began taking Kratom, or as me and my friends call it ""Kray Kray"".  At first it was easy to quit because it was so damn hard to take.  However, stopping and starting it, I perfected the way to take it.

I take about 3 tablespoons, put it in a small square Tupperware container, approx 3"" wide by 4"" tall.  I then add some purified water, snap the lid on and shake.  I then keep adding water and shaking until the mixture becomes the texture of putty or play-doh.  

When consuming it I simply pinch off a piece, roll it into a ball, lay it on my tongue, and swallow it with water like taking a pill.  Practically zero taste, quick, easy, clean, and simple.

Once I perfected this method I began taking kratom on a constant basis.  My life got kicked into overdrive, I was happy, confident, FULL of energy, and the best part: finally free from alcohol and any other substances.  I felt zero desire to take anything else.  

I soon found myself landing bigger and better jobs, life was improving on all fronts.  However, later I found my sex drive was non-existent, acne was worsening, I could have a conversation and walk away remembering nothing, I would get overheated and very cold randomly, and many other side effects were happening.

To keep up appearances, I would take doses every few hours throughout the day.  People at work, people in side hustles, and family members now knew me as this high energy person who seemed to dominate everything.  Many, many people were impressed.  I had built deep, intimate connections with so many people.  However, my tolerance was at its highest and the problems were beginning to overtake me.

That's when I decided it's time to walk away.  It took a handful of attempts.  Suddenly I became this empty shell with no motivation.  I felt awful I could not be the person everyone was used to.  Many people confronted me because ""I was not being myself"".  Depression from lack of kratom set in, but also depression because I could not be that person who everyone had grown to love.  Many sleepless nights from restless leg, hand, and arm syndrome.  Eventually I broke through the habit.

The entire experience lasted a little over a year.  Things settled and everything got back on track after awhile.  However, I am now finding myself drinking every night, napping when I should be taking care of things, etc.  This is life currently.  I've tried many approaches including prescribed medications to kick the alcohol consumption.  I can't keep it away.  

It's been well over a year since I last took Kratom, it is far behind me.  I find myself wondering if I could take limited doses of kratom to kick the urge to drink alcohol, get a boost of energy to catch up on some things, and then taper off becoming free from all substances.

I went to another aa meeting last night i was a little late, it was a men's group, as i walk in its packed and i hear ""and then he shot himself with an AK47..."" I thought, this will be an interesting meeting.

Then later the guy goes on to talk about he had been homeless, living in the woods for a white, again, drunk as fuck, sleeping and he felt something, thought it was mosquitoes so he just covered his head. He woke up later hungover, covered in fire ant bites head to toe, and spent the next day puking and shitting and man that is just an unsettling image.

It's funny because i already knew 4 of the guys at this meeting. One was my celly last time i went to jail, hes kind of a bitch-ass but i mean I'm cool with him, i was friendly.

Anyways I'm just so happy that I got myself off the kratom and look forward to feeling better day by day. I feel so much more free. I kind of have to go to 12 step meetings where I live and have a sponsor, and work a program.

It was real weird, when I was in detox they had two meetings a day. Id go straight to my room i was to fucked up to tolerate that shit. Well the Friday night (i left the next Sunday morning) i was watching a movie in the little movie room by myself and the tech walks in and says meeting time, so I paused it started heading to my room and all of a sudden I see my old sponsor walk in with a guy that used to live at a different house with me.

I was very surprised to see them both. Both used to be heavy drug users, one had a minor heart attack and stroke from smoking crack, the other was injecting herion, or in sure w/e he could get his hands on into his jugular. Both have over a year sober. They don't look like they used to do drugs and they seem happy. Their lives are manageable.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.3983488}"

I have been taking Kratom on and off for a couple years and never experienced any withdrawal. Sincerely this past January, I started taking adderall to study for school and Kratom afterwards to help me sleep. I eventually stopped the adderall and only took Kratom as I started to feel that I was able to focus better. I was taking about one serving of 3g per day. I recently started lifting heavy at the gym and the soreness was so unbearable so I started taking 3g Kratom after the gym. In the mornings I have noticed that I felt sick and foggy headed and irritable. But the time early afternoon hits, I would have a pounding headache and have trouble keeping my eyes open and my legs would get very achy. This feeling is very scary and I want to quit while minimizing true withdrawal symptoms. What is everybody’s advice on how to proceed.

The past few days while using, Ive felt so sick. I got the wobbles every time, felt nauseated, and the anxiety of the love of my life finding out has been insane. If she finds out, we’re over. I can’t keep hiding, I can’t keep lying, I can’t keep feeling and looking sick all the damn time. 

Enough is fucking enough. I just took my last dose, and tomorrow, I hop back on the quit train. I hope my clean time makes this quit a bit more forgiving, but I’m expecting the worst. Although nothing can be as bad as I feel when I’m using.

I’ve been so frustrated with myself lately dealing with addiction. I hate that I don’t feel normal now because of stupid ass Kratom. I am not even exaggerating when I say that my life had never been better than it was in the year leading up to my Kratom use & I feel like I just fucked it all up. For what reason?! Because “Kratom helps with my anxiety at work”, I justified my addiction, the addiction that formed the first time I touched Kratom. I had just gone through heroin addiction from 17-19 & got sober a year before I started Kratom. Things were looking up for me, I had never been so healthy, so beautiful, so energetic & I was a SILLY ASS BITCH too, I was always making everyone around me laugh & I miss that more than anything. I miss feeling emotions so much. I am a total zombie now, inside & out, because I look like complete shit now too & have lost damn near 30 pounds in the last year. I have never been so depressed, so anxious and overall, mentally unstable in my entire life & I need to get sober once & for all. I am absolutely terrified, especially since I just started a new job a couple months ago, I love my new job but it’s a huge change from my last job which was at a KRATOM STORE! I have come to the conclusion that I will not go forward as long as I’m attached to this garbage. I’m constantly in this cycle where I get motivated to quit because I have self love & want to take care of myself, but then I piss that motivation away when I start being self loathing and think “I’m a piece of shit anyways so what does it matter”. One good thing I have accomplished this year, however, is that I quit smoking cigarettes. I started smoking at 15, im 22 now, so I had a few years addicted to smoking. I got myself to quit cigarettes by eating a piece of fruit everytime I started getting cravings. I think I am really going to try this out for Kratom too, but I will say my addiction is way stronger with Kratom than it has ever been with cigarettes. I wanted to share this though, because I think the cravings are the hardest thing to deal with (for me anyways), I lack self control, so having something on hand to distract me helps tremendously. I’ve been on Kratom for a little over two years, at my peak I was using about 60GPD, but as of now I am around 30-40GPD. My thing is that i am fully aware I don’t feel good even when I take Kratom, that it is no longer helping me in any way, & that it is holding me back, it’s made me question my sanity at times & made me feel like a complete stranger to myself. My logic at first was if I work on my mental health & confidence first, maybe it would be easier for me to quit because I wouldn’t feel the need to use it for anxiety, but I have come to realize that my mental health will not get any better as long as I am taking Kratom & actively making myself feel worse. Done being a roadblock in my own life. Ok I’m done rambling. Just needed to clear my mind, it’s been a long day stuck inside my thoughts. Hope everyone has a good day/night.

Today is day 9. I'm feeling good! 
Sleep is still tough. I found the only thing helping for sleep is magnesium, melatonin and a small dose of nyquil. But I'm sure this is all temporary. 
Yesterday I wasnt in a great mood, but I don't blame this solely on kratom. I had a stressful day at work which would've put me in a bad mood regardless if I had kratom or not. 
I think one important thing to remember is not all bad days are going to be due to quitting kratom. 
Remember how many bad days you had before you discovered kratom? 
It's okay not to be okay sometimes. Just try to find the silver linings everyday. 
My silver lining was that I didn't have to make sure I had enough kratom caps ready to get through the day. 
It's so weird, my routine for years was waking up, going to my computer room immediately and packing kratom caps for the day. Every single morning. 
Today I got up and went to my computer room and stood there for a second trying to remember why i went in there. Then it clicked. 
The only thing that's truly bothering me now is the brain fog. I can't wait for my mind to be totally clear of this plant. 
On the bright side, I feel my creativity coming back. It's nice to be weird again haha. 
Before I found kratom, my friends all knew me as being very creative. These last 4 years have turned me into a zombie. It's nice to feel again.

I first started having kratom about three years ago. The first year was mostly sporadically with some longer breaks but it all started to accelerate the following two years. Tho i've still had some ""sober"" periods (couple of days, about 4/5 times, where the WD's were not too prominent) I really started to notice the negative effects of my usage lately.

It all started when my buddy gave me some to try one day at work, I was hesitant at first but why not. I’ve tried plenty of other drugs before so I said sure. Holy crap was it amazing I felt a total bliss aura around me. Like I was walking on clouds I felt amazing. My anxiety and social awkwardness and other things went away instantly.

I was already one of the hardest workers there so I decided I was going to buy some help me get through the long boring days that required lots on manual labour. I enjoyed it I was turning into a even greater worker then before. I would work so hard day after day, non stop. I work shift work so it was a bit harder for me to dose but I still managed.

I would dose anywhere from 25-30 grams a day. My social life and work life excelled in ways I could never imagine. I was never the shy one anymore I was a new me.

Once I quit, I gained a ton of weight and felt like I just kept swapping out vices with overeating being the big one.

Then along came kratom. It was a miracle drug. I could take a few grams, get a euphoric effect, and be in complete control and also reduce anxiety. I had finally found my thing!

Well, as time went on, you know how it goes. Start with 2g the go up to 6 to get the same effect. Next thing you know you’re plowing through 50g in a weekend. 

There were a couple times I quit for a couple months at a time to prove I wasn’t addicted and that I could handle it. Well, I got back on the Kratom train and have been doing 20g or more a day for two weeks straight. Every day I wake up and say I’m not gonna use it then I spend the whole day rationalizing it.

As I type this, I’m lying in bed on the verge of vomiting because I took too much to get that euphoria. It was at this point I realized, I can’t do this anymore. It’s not fair to my wife who had to suffer through my alcoholism and it’s not fair to myself. I immediately took $200 worth of Kratom to the dumpster and tossed it. I cannot keep on playing with Fire because every time I restart, it escalates quicker and higher than before so its time to put a nail in this coffin before it get out of hand.

I’ve been struggling with taking a combination of kratom, effexor, wellbutrin, cannabis, adderall, alcohol, and xanax regularly. I’m 29 and am the very definition of a functional addict. I came off effexor a couple months ago, and recently detoxed from the rest several days ago with no intention of returning. As I’m sure many of you can relate, being born with compulsive behavioral traits doesn’t make matters easy. I managed to kick all of the other hard drugs (primarily cocaine, opioids, and MDMA) this time last year due to a series of unfortunate panic attacks which led me to believe I was dying. Well, now the same thing happened, and I can only imagine it is my body’s genuine cry for help and desire for me to truly fix my compulsions and addiction. I am a licensed engineer with a great job, friends, and a family who loves me. I haven’t had a romantic partner in years because I’ve lived in shame of my habits. After seeing myself go through the process of detoxing from a number of different substances over the years (I’ve been trying to quit various substances since about 22), I am officially fed up with it and never want to do it again. I know this is what addicts speak of when they say quitting is truly an iterative process, because familiarizing yourself with the feelings that accompany withdrawal and eventually sobriety is necessary for some to finally kick the(ir) habit(s). 

Letting nihilism defeat you is not a good way to go. No one wants to wake up at 50 and look at themselves in the mirror in self disgust with all the events that have led to that point. No more shame. No more guilt. No more self loathing. For addicts, our struggle is our mortality. In order to live a little, you must overcome this struggle and feel as though you’ve accomplished something in life. No greater feeling to be had than the satisfaction of beating the ever living, unloving shit out of your addiction. For good. I want this try to be my last as I have others in the past. If I fail, I will try again. If I fail, I will try again. I will try and try and try until I win.

2019-10-21 16:25:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/dl6d85/my_battle/,My Battle,"After being a long time lurker of Reddit (particularly r/quittingkratom), I decided to share my story with everyone here as I have gained so much from reading each of your's.   


Without going into too much detail about my usage, I have taken an average of 10-15gpd since early 2018. Personally, I used it as a means to be more productive at my high-pressure job. In June 2019, I made the decision I needed to take control of my life. After a slow taper, I ended up being Kratom-free for about 3-4 weeks (and felt great during this time frame). My downfall was keeping a small amount in my office ""for emergency"" situations. There was a particularly tiring day at work where I decided taking a small amount, promising myself this would be a one-time thing. No surprise, I fell deep back into usage (even heavier than before).   


Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, I dealt with some of the worst anxiety I have ever experienced. It felt as if I wasn't even connected or in control of my body. I laid in bed that night ashamed of what I had fallen back into. It felt like I was letting down myself and all those close to me. This was my breaking point. No longer was I going to let a substance dictate how I lived and the emotions I felt. The next day, I sat down with my wife and hashed out everything I was feeling. I let her know how much I was struggling. Coupled with the stories on this forum, it was exactly the motivation and strength I needed to finally kick this nasty habit.  
That began my aggressive taper, to which I can now successfully say I've completed. It is with pleasure I have thrown out the remaining amount of Kratom I have (as it now feels like an investment rather than a cost).   


Today, I went for a walk with my dog. It was as if a foggy screen had been lifted from behind my eyes. The fallen leaves smelled crisper. The sun shining through the trees was beautiful. I took so much more joy in watching my dog chase after squirrels and chipmunks and fail every single time. **This is life**.   


What I really wanted to get to on this post is my personal interpretation of a struggle with Kratom (and other substances like it). On my walk, I had a moment of clarity accompanied by some very corny imagery. Each of us has a boat that represents our being. Inevitably, that boat will spring a leak (struggles we face in every day life...anxiety, depression, fatigue, etc). Instead of docking our boat and recognizing/analyzing the problem, we plug the hole with whatever will help us push on with our journey (whether it be Kratom, alcohol, sex, etc). As life goes on, more and more leaks start presenting themselves and no amount of quick fixes will do the trick. The boat becomes overwhelmed, and we begin to sink.   


What Kratom has taught me is that we need to be ok with the issues that will undoubtedly arise in our life. It's ok to be tired. It's ok to be anxious. It's ok to feel sad. Rather than cover up these problems, we need to observe them and ask ourselves why it is we feel that way. As observers who are accepting of whatever state we are in, we are able to more productively quell these rocky times in our lives.   


I'm extremely thankful for all of you who have shown vulnerability in this forum, and have shared your stories. It has made me feel a connection with each and every one of you. This vulnerability is what will help us all continue to strengthen our being and face whatever hardships that come our way.",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.42556572}"

while perusing this subreddit I couldn't help but notice that most people speak about their attempt to quit but don't bother to give a hint why they chose to dump kratom in the first place. So I have a simple question to you: **What made you decide to quit kratom?**

'Rock bottom' is repeatedly mentioned around here which was the trigger in my case as well. I quit cold-turkey a few days ago as I had done already a few times over the course of the last three years during which I've had regular contact with kratom. The last few months have been very rough for my brittle soul and once again I took to kratom to numb the pain and keep me going, which, frankly, did work very well.

However, as it ought to be with any substance misused blindly as a panacea, the positive effects begin to lessen while at the same time the doses increase day by day. Life quality worsens, the joy of being alive subsides and rock bottom is hit. In my case I just could not bear the stress of my everyday life and figured that if kratom didn't help I had no need to continue using it and just let go of everything for the last few days including my daily dose of kratom.

My withdrawal has been going by the book: Flu symptoms, restless legs, atrociously bad sleep, lethargy, inability to focus and a severe lack of hope and joy. The most insidious aspect of all of those symptoms is that they do not feel foreign to me. It's as if I've always had them. Before I decided to check out this subreddit to ground myself I just reckoned that those feelings are just how life is and will continue to be and I'm very thankful for your courage to quit and the willingness to share your experiences. It makes the whole chore even possible in the first place. Few people posses the inherent strength and faith in the cosmos to keep going through rough times by themselves and I'm certainly not one of them. Learning about the experience of others is vitally helpful.

So, I'll be killing some time for the next days waiting for things to balance out. In the meantime I'm going to do some research on negative aspects of prolonged kratom usage *as observed by kratom users*. I have always held kratom in high regard as a tool to help overcome stressful periods and I have never felt acute adverse effects. However, it might be that there are subtle aspects of kratom usage which did creep up to me during the last months and that I've just come to accept as axioms of life. We'll see how the world will look in a few weeks.

My last dose was Wednesday night, I’m on day 4 ct, and I went ahead and got a bag today. Took one scoop, and have since flushed the rest.

Beyond the allergy/RLS/insomnia symptoms, it was actually pretty easy psychologically to quit - every time I took a dose I was increasingly aware of how it was dampening my skills and creativity. 

Originally got on it during a period of experimenting with nootropics - had quit prescribed adderall and read kratom was legal, could help focus and anxiety, and didn’t interfere with sleep or cause main. 

Was entirely wrong - scaled up the dosage very quickly - kratom has a way of making you think you are productive or doing the right things when in reality it isolates you and slows down your functioning tremendously. It’s hilarious how all these people talk about how the strains are such powerful enhancers - how is it possible that a substance simultaneously enhances sleep and gives you energy? Only someone on an addicted kratom brain is going to believe that BS. 

And don’t even get me started on these people saying how much it helps with socializing - on what planet does being dizzy, drowsy and forgetful help you socialize? I can’t remember one time in four years where kratom enhanced an interaction with another human being- the majority of the time it just made me a humorless zombie. 

Anyway not sure if everyone agrees with my characterization of kratom addiction, and surely if used in moderation it has rewarding effects....but anyone whose studied neuroscience knows that reward is not equivalent to happiness.

I only saw the positive side of it while researching. So I dove in head first. I bought two huge bags at first so it lasted me quite a long time. (A couple months maybe?) Those eventually started to run out and  I was too broke to order another bag on time. That's when it quit being fun. I realized how addicted I was to this green devil. I went 30hrs before finding out they sold it in a town 40mins away. I have no idea how people can spend 5x the money buying it locally. So I experienced the lethargy, depression and restless body. I didnt sleep a wink until 6am when I dozed off for 1-2hrs. This happened 1 other time a couple months later. By April I was up to 30gpd. By summer I was taking 50gpd. I would typically dose every 4hrs. Sometimes every 3. I quickly became a moody, angry, unmotivated, sweating zombie. Always in a thick fog. My short term memory is terrible.  Ive always been a loner but started to isolate myself even more. After realizing how addicted I had become, I got very scared. I had no clue what to expect. I have never done any sort of opiods. Only weed and alcohol. So the googling began....and I stumbled upon this sub. I actually had never used Reddit up to this point. I finally had a general understanding of what the withdrawls would entail and the sub brought me comfort. I began trying to figure out when I could quit. I couldn't take a week off work during the summer. Luckily, im switching from my seasonal summer job back to my other job for the winter. I told the summer job that they needed me back a week sooner than they actually did. So I have 10/20-10/26 completely free. I went to the doctor 2 seperate times. The first doctor was in a hurry, didnt listen to what I was saying and just threw me a script for ropinirole. Heard spme bad things about it and some great things.

One Friday I just told my boss i didn't feel well and need to go home, and had fun for a gew days and went to detox the next Tuesday.

I had been taking subutex and suboxone here and there, doing an occasional prescription opiote when it was extremely easy to get from someone i know and trust. I was also taking xanax, i got drunk as fuck two days before, and was eating xanax bars, and did 40 mg of adderall in about 1.5 hours. I also snorted two caps of herion the day and night before i went to detox, snorted the last half a cap at 3 am before detox, then at 6am took 4 mg of suboxone, then went to detox at about 2:00 pm.

Normally i only took kratom and over 1,000 mg of caffeine a day, and smoked a pack of cigs a day. On top of riding 10 to 20 miles and doing Carpentry in a tropical climate. Fucking ridiculous, idk how i didn't drop. I was like the energizer bunny, until the kratom started to wear off and eventually just barley worked. But i only got drunk and did all these drugs after i made the choice to go to detox that Friday, and had been thinking about it for a week prior.. I set it up to where i put down a deposit on a halfway house, but the deal was i had to be medically cleared, meaning i can't leave detox until the nurse tells me I can. 

And man did i try to convince them to release me without ama (against medical advice) because if I went ama id be homless. I walked away from 260$ from the place i was renting, so i had two weeks left and just said fuck it. But the nurse said nope, no chance. 

It made me so emotionally numb. I had to really control myself at work not to flip the fuck out on someone so I just did my best not to show my anger.

My emotions are coming back and I feel like absolute shit. Im very tired, but forced myself to ride my bike 10 miles today, I got out of detox at 5am and didn't sleep last night.

They gave me 25 mgs of librium 3 times a day for the first 3 days and 800 mg of gabapentin 3 times a day (because i was prescribed this, even though i took it all long ago, I loved mixing it with kratom) and clonidine 2 times a day and vistrol if i asked for it I think every two hours and the akstia was still insane. I was one pissed off mother fucker because we couldn't smoke cigs (which i could deal with because they have patches) but the main thing no caffeine. Only decaffeinated coffee or tea. Fuuuck that.

I'm glad I set it up the way i did to create an incentive to not leave ama. I really wanted too.

Now I've walked through the hottest part of the fire. I might not sleep for a few days and i feel like absolute garbage, I'm exhausted, but I'm digging having feelings again, happy or sad. Beforehand i just felt depressed and angry all the time.

Also i fucking ate like a champ in detox. Everyone else couldn't believe I could eat as much as i did. But hey they took away my caffeine and cigarettes, gave me benzos and gabentin and couldn't sleep half the time so I just ate and drank milk. Litterally gained ten pounds in 5 days. Which for me is good.

By the way the detox i went to is in ft pierce Florida. It's a republican dominated County. The detox is on a sliding scale, very affordable, if you're homeless or jobless (and you don't have to prove it) they won't bill you. Doesn't mean matter where you're from. However pop a xanax or pain pill the day before and tell them you had a problem with that stuff because They won't admit you purely on Kratom, they don't really know about it yet.

 They'll also set you up with a 30 day program, and again if you're poor or jobless /homeless it'll be completely free, no matter where you're from.

I can't wait for the next 3 to 4 days to be over because from this point on I'll recovery relatively quickly.",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.68066657}"

For years I did a antidepressants roller coaster with the VA and finally weened myself off 2 years ago. Since then, although I battle with depression, overall I do OK.

I found Kratom listening to Rogans podcast last year and ordered a small amount through an online vendor. Only used it a couple times a week and it felt like a miracle drug. I was happy, euphoric and outgoing, patient with my kids, I QUIT ACOHOL WHICH WAS HUGE FOR ME....I was killing it at work and overall being a better person.

I again ordered through a new online vendor and was accidentally shipped a 1000grqms (4-250g bags of diff strains). I told the vendor and they said thanks for being honest but you can keep it. Having that much I soon found myself taking daily. 

Fast forward 8 months and I have now used daily (with the exception of a day here and there). Current usage is between 8-12gpd. I know that’s not a lot to some on here but it’s all I needed. 

Now I feel like I need to quit. It doesn’t really do anything for me anymore but I’m dependent on it, not sure if it’s physically or psychologically dependent. No more euphoria, not much of anything tbh. I refuse to increase my dose as I fee it will compound the problem.

I’m sure if I taper/quit my alcohol usage would go back up. I don’t want that. I feel like I always need something and that’s not a good feeling.  I don’t want to be raging/moody with the family, it’s not their fault. 

Is this more of a mental game? Or is this really a physical issue?

Is the taper guide the way to go?

It started as a great boost for productivity and to deal with the stresses and anxieties of life and is now causing more harm than good. Now I never feel ""normal"" - physically or mentally. Too much Kratom? Not enough? Something else? Argh!

I was up to probably 30-60+ gpd, depending on the day. I work (a lot) from home and can dose at any time, so my use has varied greatly based on circumstance. The amount has continued to rise over the last \~2yr of use. I decided that I wanted to quit a few months ago, but of course there is never a good time. ""Just this one more week, then next weekend I will quit"" - I am a single parent with two young kids (middle school and elementary), so there really is never a good time...

Anyway, I can't do this to myself (or my kids) anymore, so I'm gonna jump very soon. I'm down to around 10-20 gpd, again depending on my responsibilities for the day, but like so many others, tapering just doesn't work for me. I've taken what I have left (a little over 1 oz) and made some capsules - since it absorbs more slowly I seem to be able to regulate my doses better. I would really like to flush it all, but I have events Monday and Friday with one child and a Parent/Teacher conference this week as well, so I'm too apprehensive to toss it all. Another week of 5 gpd may not be a bad idea anyway - I certainly cannot afford to be out of commission for any length of time.

My plan is to follow all of the pointers here and see how it goes. I've been reading for days, so I feel pretty educated on what works for some folks. I'll post again with more specifics, but my regimen will include a strict diet, exercise, meditation, supplements, etc. from what I've been reading here.

I was clean for 1 year and 1 month when a coworker wanted to try it so I did it with him. That turned into 10-20 GPD for 6 months! 

  
Today is my eighth day completely off of it and MAN I am completely tortured with loneliness today. The weather is grey and freezing cold and rainy and I have no obligations and my good friend has been at work all day. Where is everybody? I have no purpose or drive in life. I can't even make myself physically comfortable.  


I need advice on dealing with the inner panic feeling. Today literally feels like everyone I know has left Earth and I am walking around in a dream. I just went to Barnes & Noble to sit and read and be in public to see other humans. I can't stop reminiscing about my failed 3 year relationship. Does Kratom withdrawal make you nostalgic and super sensitive to dwelling on memories?

  
It's been eight days and I STILL have the chills 24/7. The inability to get warm. Over the 6 months of daily usage, my body has learned to expect the ""opioid warm blanket"" feeling. This drug is insane, I had no idea how many things I was blurring out with that crap. Can someone give me some hope that this Derealization feeling won't stay for long? Using 10-20 GPD for 6 months .. how much longer after 8 days can these side effects go on for?

Sometimes that magnification is actually for the better (you'll see posts on here with people saying they're noticing music sounds better, their libido is intensifying, etc). A lot of times it's for the worse (you find yourself an absolute emotional wreck, you overthink literally every single thought that comes into your head). Little things that you're not thinking about can get wrapped up in that intensification, but you're not necessarily seeing it and it can weigh on you and make the quit that much harder (or make the urge to relapse that much stronger).

For basically the entire first two weeks after my last dose, the weather was horrible. It was dark, rainy, and cold for almost two weeks straight. Then one day it was gorgeous out, very sunny and relatively warm. And even though I'd slept terribly for the 15th night in a row, that day felt *amazing*. Being outside was glorious, the sun on my face was wonderful, the warmth was comforting. And I felt better than I'd felt in weeks. 

Then I thought back to my first quit a year+ ago. I'd quit in the summer, while the days were longer and much warmer and there happened to be a lot of sun. The quit was hella tough, especially the insomnia and the general bad mood. But I remembered going for long, sunny walks every day and finding peace in that. 

On the flip-side, during my first quit, work was hellish, but I was convinced I needed to suck it up and just do the CT quit, no matter what else was going on, because I had to have Kratom out of my life. The intense work schedule and difficulty of my customers weighed on me so heavily. Hours of every day I was so eager to relapse so I could just get some relief and relaxation. This time around, work is really low key. I really have nothing I want to escape from mentally/emotionally and so my desire to use is way down. It still crops up, but it's so much easier than the first time. 

All this is to say, as you take on your quit, or as you prepare for it, *really* start thinking about your circumstances and the situation you're in. Take stock of the things you both can and can't control. (If you haven't quit yet, please know that I'm not necessarily saying you should wait until the 'right time' to quit. If you do that, you run the risk of constantly finding a way to tell yourself it's not the right time and extending your use. The right time to quit is now, just prepare for it.) 

Make note of the weather every day. Ask yourself if that's affecting any aspect of how you feel. A rainy, dreary day can cast a pall over everything you do, and when you're already feeling dark from withdrawals, it's magnified even further. Remind yourself that the weather will change, as will your feelings. Just get through this crappy day. Take strength from those days where the sun is out and things don't feel so gloomy. 

Check in with yourself about work and life stressors. When you're feeling like it's all such a heavy burden, look at the stuff that is non-negotiable (like your job) then remember that the burden of your withdrawal is lessening every day. You've just got to soldier on a little more and the load will lighten. On the days where those stressors are less, soak that up. Even in just a couple of hours outside of work, feel the lessened burden and remind yourself that as you push through your withdrawal, the burden will lighten further on its own. 

Finally, think of all the circumstances you can control and use those to give yourself comfort and relief. Eat foods that nourish you, make you happy and give you comfort. Do things you enjoy. Put on TV shows or movies you like. Read a good book. Watch some really funny stand up comedy. Listen to podcasts about things you like. Zone out on video games for a bit. Legit, heart-pounding is great if you have the time and willingness, but at the very least go take a long walk.

Wherever you can, give yourself pleasurable, enjoyable things. Even if you don't feel like you're enjoying them because you're in the midst of withdrawals. Try to find comforts. Be aware of the factors you're not in control of that are contributing to your comfort and/or discomfort. Take all this stuff and look at the whole picture. Strategize on how to make it all work for you and keep reminding yourself that the way your feeling is a confluence of factors, some of which (withdrawals, PAWS, missing Kratom) are going to lessen every day. 

You can get through this. Work with what you've got. Be mindful of your circumstances and remember that the load is lightening every day, even if it's sometimes difficult to feel that.",18,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4040449}"

I’m new to this community, but unfortunately not new to quitting opioids. After being in the military for YEARS, and being on on a mixture of percs/hydro/tramadol, which then escalated to fentanyl patches...I was able to quit CT when I realized I was making trips to the ER for no “real” reason other than pain that couldn’t be pinpointed — a result of my withdrawals. 

3 years later...insert Kratom...which, essentially, was my “relapse” and it worked wonderfully...until it didn’t anymore. After a year+ of anywhere between 21-40 GPD, and obviously a lot of money spent (wasted), I decided to stop CT again. 

So far (on Day 3) the symptoms haven’t been near as severe from a body ache, flu-like standpoint, but the crawling in my arms/legs and feeling the need to like clamp my fists together compulsively when I try and lay still is absolutely wrecking me.

Anyone else experience an extreme sense of derealization after quitting? Its like living in a constant dream, nothing feels quite real or completely familiar to my life. I've been trying so hard to get myself out of my head, and sometimes I do okay...but then times like now it's almost impossible.

I've been taking ZzzQuil(diphenhydramine) to sleep, and it's been working okay. I never really got any RLS, but even still, it's so hard to sleep without help. No matter how much sleep I get I still feel exhausted when I wake up, so maybe that is contributing to the depression? 

Any idea when this stage will pass? I sure hope its soon, but even that thought is discouraging, as I have a surgery for my back pain scedualed in a month from now, and I feel like the opiates they use in the general anesthesia is going to trigger all of this all over again.

For mental/emotional, ive tried to accept the anxiety, pause when it hits and investigate it, even doing corny stuff like calling it my friend (eyeroll).   
And i wonder, did i have this anxiety most of my life? Is this why alcohol and pot felt like medicine in my teens and 20s, why my first percocet felt like i *finally* found clarity and peace (i wasn't high, i was clear-thinking, confident and pain-free). And why i could still deal with busy days when i moved to kratom.  This is by far my longest time not on alcohol, percs/tramadol or kratom.

Shit is really nasty and just because you haven’t had problems with it before doesn’t mean you won’t ever.

I’m happy to say I’m at 350mg + 350mg  down from 3.2gpd. The only good thing (if you can call it that) is that you can taper on a daily basis unlike Kratom which takes much longer for your body to adapt to new level of intake. So now dealing with multiple quits which totally sucks!

There are many posts that I can identify with, especially with the ones where it is mentioned that there is an important job, school or a family that needs to be taken care of. This was me to a “T”. My addiction had me believe that I would not be able to function without the substance (K) and that what should have been my priorities would suffer and have detrimental consequences should I quit. I’m here to tell you that this is a lie that you are telling yourself. Until my #1 priority became getting off this crap there was no feasible path to a successful quit. The WD for getting off this crap are pretty much the same for everyone, some last longer, some are variably shorter. I was lucky (no RLS), mine did not last that long and I was semi functional after about 4-5 days after my last dose. I had all the other symptoms described in almost every post.

My secret sauce to quitting was first making a decision that I would not use K after September 1, 2018, the second was making a plan for the quit which included taking off a few days from work and utilizing a long holiday weekend, the third part was just hard knuckling through the cravings and bullshit my addicted brain made up trying to get me to use again.

What I’m trying to say is that you need to make your quit your #1 priority and forget the word “BUT” for the next 14 days. I promise you that by doing so you will be successful and get back to a normal more meaningful life. Your addict brain will fight you tooth and nail through this early process. You’re inevitably stronger that you believe and such an amazing life awaits you on the other side.

Words cant even begin to explain how intense it is. Sometimes it makes me wonder if it will ever go away and then I get even more depressed. It's way worse than the physical part. 

I'm sure I won't take it ever again, I don't have any cravings at all. The thought of picking it up again makes me sick to my stomach, so that wont be a problem. The problem is that I have an important surgery scedualed for almost exactly a month from now, and I'm terrified I wont be past the mental part of withdrawl yet. Or will still be in PAWS. I know that kratom acts similar to an opiate, and I know fentanyl(a super strong opiate) is commonly used in general anesthesia, so will that restart my withdrawls? Because technically to my brain, wouldnt that be like a relapse?

I'm finally beginning to see the damn light here.  I'm definitely not 100% yet.  But I feel literally EXPONENTIALLY better than I did yesterday. It's a gift and I'm not sure if it'll last, but I'm damn grateful.

5.5 months may not seem like a long time of use, but I've been battling addiction my entire life.  In my teens and early twenties, it was Vicodin.  Then benzos.  Then alcohol.  Then all sorts of legal shit I could get my hands on.  3 years ago I quit Kratom, after a year-long habit.  I truly believe that I have fried my opiate receptors, and every time I go back, it gets worse and worse and worse, in terms of withdrawal.  I've been sober from all the aforementioned substances since 2016, with the exception of Kratom.  

For some reason, I thought it would be okay to use just a tiny bit, because I was having a monumentally dark patch in my life and thought it would help cope.  DON'T MAKE MY MISTAKE, please!  I only thank God that I haven't wound up relapsing on alcohol or opiates as a result of this withdrawal.

This is a rather disjointed monologue, but if there's one symptom that has actually gotten WORSE with time, it's the brain fog.  So please forgive my incessant ramblings, because it's so freaking hard to concentrate right now.

Speaking of which, anyone have an estimate for when you got your concentration back?  I feel like mine has been lost forever...",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.34091073}"

I'm done with using kratom. I've been using kratom for like 20gpd for around 3 months. Yesterday I had a talk with my GP. He suggested I could go in-patient or try to CT at home with a very low dose of Suboxone to help combat withdrawal. I'm not too sure if he understand the kratom well enough and might think it's just another opioid. Searching this sub made clear a lot of people don't think it's a good idea to use Suboxone. But there were also people who took a low dose once and felt it helped them tremendously. I'm not entirely sure. 

I don't want to go in-patient because there will be several weeks left before I can go while I could be free in about 10 days.

I've done this before, CT, and it was doable. But this time I don't feel strong, not at all actually. In my head I'm done, but I also don't want to give in halfway through. I want this to be over. Would a low dose Suboxone once be a bad idea and does my GP not understand the kratom profile?

I’ve read almost every thread involving Kratom and ringing in your ears.
I’ve read a lot of different stories but I haven’t read ANY success/long term stories. Please, if you’ve experienced tinnitus from Kratom use, could you share if it got better, how long it took, and what I can do to accelerate the process. I took 8-10g in the morning, 
8-10g when I got home from work, duplicate dose around dinner and one before bed, so about 30-40g a day of red Bali for a year. I’ve been tapering for a week and I’m preparing to stop for good because the ringing in my left ear was intermittent at first 3 weeks ago but now it’s become constant the past week and a half. I’m a musician(who takes care of his ears) and this shit is scary. This stuff has hooks! I had no idea it was going to go this way.

My psychiatrist prescribed me Naltrexone to assist with my journey to get clean from Kratom.  I believe I must have been her first patient using Kratom. What she failed to mention and what I did not think to research was it’s imperative to wait 4-7 days after your last Kratom dose to ensure it’s fresh out of your receptors. So 8 hours after my last Kratom hit I took a 50mg Naltrexone pill. 20 minutes later I was driving into work and started sweating uncontrollably which started my 48 hour trip through literally hell on earth. I turned the car around and drive  straight to the ER. On the ride to the ER I thought seriously about driving the car straight into a tree purposely and just ending it right there. I also almost killed my self accidentally because I could not see straight, and all 4 limbs were moving uncontrollably due to extreme LMS.   The ER checked my vitals and noted a 200/105 blood pressure reading. I am typically 120/70. That was the scariest day of my life. The only silver lining was when this happens the acute symptoms only last about 48 hours. I can’t say the same thing about PAWS though. This all happened on September 1st of this year and I relapsed for the first time last weekend. Went 45 days clean and the severe depression never let up. I quit Kratom in 2018 CT and did not have this extended PAWS issue. I’m scared to death that the Naltrexone precipitated withdraw did permanent damage to my receptors. I hate that I am going through this nightmare and literally day dream everyday of ripping the faces off everyone involved in the Kratom supply chain from the farmer to the cashier at the smoke shop.  For background I never have been on opioids before. I am medicated for depression and anxiety and, like everyone, can’t tell if they do a damn thing to help. Somehow I came across an article about Kratom on a news website and decided to give it a try for depression and anxiety after I read all the great thing this “wonder drug” does for depression. I have no clue how I can ever get off this stuff now. I have a very demanding job, a more demanding wife and 4 children under the age of 7. I don’t want to play the victim here as I made all my life decisions on my own and I realize this. But I was in fact managing everything just fine before I got deep into Kratom. It’s so hard for me to quit anything, let alone one of the most addictive substances in the world in my opinion.

I've been using opiates of some sort for about ten years. I was on methadone for about a year, suboxone for 5 years, then switched to kratom for the last 4 years or so. I don't use any other drugs on a regular basis...almost never. 

I managed to get off kratom two times since I started a few years back. Both times the withdrawals lasted about 7 to 10 days before I felt somewhat normal. Exercise, sleeping a lot, and eating healthy were what seemed to help the most. 

I've been using for about 3 months since my last relapse. I thought I could use kratom only on weekends, but that was a big mistake, like many of you have stated before. I was clean for about two months feeling amazing and now I'm taking approximately 4 tablespoons a day, sometimes more. I am very mad at myself, but plan on going cold turkey in about 2 weeks. I'll have about 7 days off work thankfully. 

The lesson here is that kratom is not something addicts can use once in a while. I suppose some people can get away with it, but's it's a dangerous game to play. I'm determined to eliminate it for good this time around.

The insomnia was bad last night, worse than I've ever had from a kratom quit. The first few days I used a low dose of phenibut to help me sleep which worked pretty well.

The anxiety mainly centered around my relationship with my girlfriend. I'm pretty sure we're going to breakup soon so the anxiety was exponential worse than when I've attempted to quit in the past.

What's worrying me now is the damage sleep deprivation causes. I've been up for 26 hours so far and won't be going to bed until the 36 hour mark. I've never stayed up that long on zero sleep. I'm worried about hallucinations. I read stuff online of people seeing really creepy things like ""shadow people"". The only sleep related hallucination I've had was a twinkling star in my vision that went away quickly. Something like that isn't too bad. I'm mainly worried about auditory hallucinations or ""shadow people"".

I would lay awake at night with this thought of being trapped somewhere with complete strangers and having to be forced into detoxing off of Kratom with everyone watching. How would I explain to these ppl what was wrong with me? Why I was sick and all the symptoms that come with detoxing.  I know it doesn’t sound right, but I’m a “what if” kind of person. 

Would that have ever happened, not likely.  However I’m so relieved to know I will never need to find out.

Is my taper plan reasonable?,"Without going into unnecessary detail, this couldn’t be worse timing. Currently no income (husband RN hurt back months ago, close to employment now at least), no health insurance (I’m high risk when pregnant), already have 3 kids (10,3,2) and I love them but the 2 youngest are INSANE. I turn 36 end of this month, so not quite young anymore either. We’ll manage somehow, but life is about to crank to 11, and I’ll take any positive thoughts/prayers I can get folks. 

I’m 5 weeks pregnant now. Been taking Kratom for a year, first few months sporadically, then a few months daily, about the last half year has been twice daily, morning and evening (occasionally thrice but that midday dose was always weak). Luckily my doses haven’t gotten too out of hand yet, it was still working fine etc, but I’ve gotta taper off now. It’s time. I know without this motivation, I’ll slowly increase my dosage forever and there will always be a reason to delay quitting, and it’ll be FAR more difficult than I can imagine. I’ve spent the past few days reading every thread I could here about Kratom during pregnancy (I’m impressed with the kindness/support in this sub!) and it seems the consensus is: it might be safe but it’s not worth the risk. Looking for some input on my taper plan. I know y’all aren’t medical professionals, but my daily total (around 10g) isn’t high enough that I’m worried about miscarriage.

I’m trying to do a fairly rapid taper while not getting too sick to take care of my kiddos. I have a few helper meds like Agmatine, magnesium, l-theanine, Kava, melatonin, and a small amount of Ambien, trazodone, and a “popular study med” if I absolutely need them (not ideal during first trimester, but these would be sporadic and before the placenta takes over). Already began prenatal vitamins. I also have Unisom but apparently it makes RLS worse (I’ve never experienced RLS). Reckon I’ll need Imodium? Y’all have any suggestions for others, I’m all ears.

Spent over 5 hours (no shit) last night weighing and hand capsuling each dose bc I’m pretty sure I don’t have the willpower to measure daily out of loose powder. Another upshot (for my justifying, addict brain anyway) is I was almost out of Kratom when we found out about the pregnancy, so there is no extra to fall back on/fudge with. What I’ve got is apportioned each day. 

Started the taper yesterday and I’m taking 1g agmatine 30min-1hr before each dose. It’s 3 day holds then drops: 
3.5g am, 5g pm for 3 days
2.5g am, 4g pm for 3 days
1.5g am, 3g pm for 3 days
1g am, 2g pm for 3 days
Begin single doses
2g 3 days
1.5g 3 days
1g 3 days
.5g 3 days, then done. It’s about 3.5 weeks from 10g to 0g. 

I realize it won’t be painless, and withdrawal is different for everyone, but is my taper reasonable? Should I jump at a higher dose and use the extra somewhere else? Any suggestions/tips? I’m sorry my post wound up so long y’all, thanks for taking the time to read all that (if you did, lol).

I *believed* that getting [some of my thoughts](https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/dhdh85/i_hate_to_to_admit_it_but_this_is_better/) onto paper (digital paper, anyway) might keep them from rattling around in my head at night and keeping me up. So, thank you all for letting me tell my story yesterday, for listening, for asking questions, for commiserating and for so much positivity and encouragement.

It still took me a really long time to fall asleep, I moved around a lot at that time, couldn't find a comfortable position, occasionally had some light RLS-like symptoms. I even started to fall asleep a few times, but my conscious brain kept getting so nervous and excited and and going ""holy crap! Are we falling asleep??? Is this happening???"" and I'd get all nervous and flustered and wake up again. That was annoying. But, yeah, after an hour, I'd fallen fully asleep like a normal person does! And while I did wake up once, I fell asleep relatively quickly. It all felt like I remember sleep is supposed to feel. I woke up feeling good. Not groggy. Not craving Kratom. Ready to face the day.

This has been over two weeks in coming, so I just wanted to again share my experience because I know a lot of us come on here looking for common experiences to confirm that we haven't totally broken our bodies and brains through this trial. I mentioned previously that reading so many posts and comments saying ""just get to days 7-11"" led me to this false hope that I'd be sleeping better days ago. That timing is true for some people, but it may not be how it works out for you, which sucks because you've got longer to go, but just know that behind the scenes in your brain and body, things *are* improving now that you've quit.

I mentioned in my last post that stuff with Kratom is all about subtlety. Most people move into dependence so slowly and subtly. It doesn't start as a 30gpd habit. You just start to take a gram more every dose, chasing a better buzz. Then the side-effects of dependence creep up. Again, they're subtle. Those first few weeks of 30gpd aren't a problem. You actually feel great. But then one day you miss your regular dosing time by accident and you don't realize that the wretchedness you feel is your body craving, you just think you're in a bad mood.. You get this creeping low level anxiety at random times and there's no way you could think to pin it to your dosing because it's just there in the background. The brain fog comes on and thickens over months, so it takes you forever to notice it.

Then you quit, and everything is horrible for a while, the opposite end of the spectrum from the awesomeness of those early 30gpd days. Can't sleep, can't eat (or maybe you overeat), crave crave crave. It's a week, or two, or *more* of misery. But then one day, you sleep... better. Just like maybe you hit a whole 5 hours after getting only 2-3 for many nights. It doesn't *feel* like a win, because it's still not enough sleep, but it's more, and you add some sleep every night... again, a subtle improvement One day you wake up and dosing *isn't* the first thing you think about. sure, you'll think about it later but it's not the *first* thing. One day you realize it's your standard dosing time and you're out doing something fun, or active, or creative or productive rather than sitting on your couch and dosing.

All these things add up over the course of days, weeks, months and years. At the beginning and even in the middle of it, when the withdrawal symptoms are still there and the stack of positive improvements isn't so big, and the memory of how good the buzz felt is still fresh in your mind, it can feel like ""why did I ever quit? Life *off* Kratom is way worse than life on it."" But give it time, let those positives keep subtly stacking and let yourself drift further away from the memory of the buzz. You will one day, months, look back on everything and think ""I'm better for this.

My sleep is horrible. Horrible headaches. My brain is finally starting to get the jist that kratom is not an option. Surprisingly I havnt had any cravings for kratom.

The only craving I have is to be free of it completely and heal my brain. I know I should feel accomplished about to hit 30 days but I keep telling myself to make it to day 45. Then 60 then 90. 

It's war on the mind. It's the wierdest feeling knowing that the greyness and the numbness and the overall unwillingness to smile is a temporary thing caused by kindling and relapsing over and over. 

It's very wierd. It helps to have such a supportive spouse. I can't imagine ever trying to keep it a secret. Don't do that. If your spouse loves you, they will only want to help. Hiding it only damages everything.

I'm mentally preparing myself for the couple days of extreme lethargy I have to look forward to since I'm going on a addy break.

Need to stop.,"I was introduced to kratom at 16 years old and instantly fell in love with it. I had a couple previous experiences with opioids like Percocet and Hydrocodone and I absolutely loved the high but never allowed myself to get hooked. But i looked at kratom differently. Thinking it was benign/harmless because of it being legal and not as intense as prescription painkillers. I started by taking kratom a couple times a week then that turned into once a day. From there, it turned to 2 times a day, then 3, then 4, and then 5 times day (currently) at around 45-50 gpd. I love it so much and all i can really think about is focusing on my next kratom dose. It took me a while for me to realize how much kratom was really impacting me and how badly i needed to quit. Even though it’s possible, going CT for me is completely out of the question. The withdrawal symptoms for me feel so damn unbearable and i feel that there’s no way i can go CT. So my only other option would be to taper. I have attempted to taper a couple of times previously and made some progress by getting down to 30 gpd but I always end up relapsing. I get this sudden motivation to get clean every once in a while but the desire subsides within a week or so of tapering by a more intense desire for a kratom dose. I’ve been taking kratom for so long consistently that i’ve become so used to being on it 24/7, making it extremely hard to taper. I just took hopefully my last full dose at 5.5 grams and I made the decision today that i’m going to begin another attempt at tapering to a really low gpd intake before i jump off to CT so I can kick this shit for good. I’m so fed up with letting this stuff control my life. Any words of encouragement or tips for tapering would be much appreciated. I know this is going to be hard but seeing that i’m not the only one going through this helps out a lot.",10,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.38645694}"

Getting clean from this shit is a battle. The clarity you can achieve is amazing but unfortunately it doesn’t take away the hurt you’ve both endured and caused in the past. Yesterday was my anniversary and my husband I had a date night planned. I sensed something was off but for most of the time things coasted along. 

Then, on the drive home, I criticized his driving. Shouldn’t have done it but it seemed so innocuous to me at the time. Well that was the straw that did it, as they say. He lit into me (verbally) and didn’t let up until I had cried and apologized for hours. He has been so supportive despite not really understanding addiction but apparently through all that just had this building resentment and anger towards me that he’d been waiting to get out. 

I don’t blame him. My addiction to that fucking sludge hurt me and my family. But I also know it’s much more complicated than that. That the faults are equally divided between us.

Kratom has changed me. I do not recognize myself in the mirror. I went to rehab in 2010. I put together over 6 years of clean time. My life became so wonderful. In that time I got married to an amazing supportive woman. We had a child, a sweet little girl named Meadow. I got a really good job that allows for my wife to be a stay at home mom. I began seeing a therapist. Everything improved. Even when tough times came my way, I didn’t pick up drugs. Right after I got clean my best friend died of an overdose. In 2012 my mom committed suicide. In 2016 I had to make the decision to mercifully pull the plug on my older sister whom had suffered a terrible seizure that left her brain dead. Awful stuff, but I made it through clean and sober. I began to branch out in life. I joined a jiu jitsu academy. I got back into making music. Everything was better than I could ever have dreamed. 

In 2017, I met this devil of a plant. During a jiu jitsu competition, I tore my ribs and the cartilage away from my sternum. It was, and still is a painful injury. Being a recovering addict, I knew I couldn’t take painkillers for it. So I just ate ibuprofen. A lot of it. For a few months. Then I heard about Kratom on a podcast. All natural. Non addictive. Mild pain reliever and stimulant. I did a quick google search. I’m assuming I worded it incorrectly. You know, if you are in this thread. There are 2 camps when it comes to Kratom. One camp that swears it’s a miracle. The camp that doesn’t want it to be banned so they pull a cover over the nasty side of it. Then there is the other camp, the truth. The camp that is a member of this thread on Reddit. My google search showed up the glamorous side. I felt comfortable that it was safe to take. So I did. If you are an addict, you know, one is too many, a thousand is never enough. And you know, all it takes is one. Sometime near the end of 2017, I took the first one. 

I won’t go into great detail of the usage. Put it this way, at first, I had no problem with it, and it confirmed my google search. I would take it a couple times. Then not. No withdrawal. No craving. No problem. I didn’t realize it was already too late, it had me. And still has me. Now 2 years later. I take between 40-60gpd. Everyday. I have only taken off 24 hours twice in the last year. Here comes the part where I describe not recognizing myself. I have strong will power. When I make my mind up that I’m going to do something, i fucking do it. I walked away from heroin. I walked away from alcohol. I told myself I wouldn’t use no matter what when the tragedies started to occur in my life. So, once I realized I had a problem with Kratom, I made my mind up. I’m done. Except, it wasn’t/isn’t “me” anymore. “ My mind has been hi jacked. My personality has been hi jacked. I tried to quit and I failed. I tried to taper. And I failed.

 So here I sit. Stuck. Wanting to stop. But not able to stop. But slowly building the courage to. Not sure how it’s gonna happen. CT at home. Rehab. Sometimes I flirt with the thought of putting a fucking shotgun in my mouth and saying fuck you Kratom I’m done (I wouldn’t actually do this one. I would never put that pain onto my daughter.) I work a lot to accommodate my wife being a stay at home mom. I work most weekends. I only have a few days of PTO. 4 to be exact. The most space I can get myself off work to CT is 6 days. I have been lurking on this thread for half a year, maybe more. I’m ready to do it. I felt like it would be a good idea to just get this off my chest to you guys. You know what it’s like. No one that I have told can fathom a vape shop selling something that does this level of damage. My wife has my back. My friends have my back. I have support. I just need to wrestle the steering wheel of my life away from the hands of Kratom long enough to get my conviction back. Thank you for listening. Damn this got wayyyyy too long.

(This is a long one, so strap in)

I fought it for a while. Kratom isn't that big a deal, right? My friends are addicted to coffee, cigarettes, booze, pills. I don't do any of those! The fact of the matter is, even on Kratom, my day to day routine is very healthy. I exercise a lot. I eat really well. I own my own business and it's a challenging job. I have a good marriage. Honestly, part of me wondered, and is still wondering, is it so wrong to just have Kratom be my one vice???

And ultimately, I think I have to admit that, yeah, it is. Because the difference, while subtle, is significant. While it never feels like this when I'm using, in hindsight, it's kind of apparent that my life when I use Kratom was about doing stuff UNTIL I could dose again. It was about doing whatever I had to do to get to the point where I could down my brew and just zone out. And I *do* work really hard, my job is stressful and dumb, and the relief Kratom gave from the stress (and also, the relief from regular soreness from a very rigorous training schedule) felt... earned. It felt like a good thing to have something that balanced out all the anxiety and frustration.

But of course, that's just looking at the positive side of things. There were always problems, and they were easy to ignore for a while, because I felt the relief outweighed them, or they subtly got more severe over time. One is the aforementioned, living around my dose. Because my routine is so set most days, this didn't seem like a problem at first. I'm gonna have to be home by 1pm every day, and be there for the next 8 hours, why not just dose then? Is that so bad? I'll get into that in a minute.

The second problem was that, while I did enjoy the buzz, the regular use came with a lot of symptoms that snuck up on me but together were not great. The brain fog is the biggest and most obvious one, but there also started to be this low-level anxiety that would creep up later in the evenings. It was starting to manifest into this like existential dread. On top of that there's the financial expenditure, not to mention the insanity that followed if I had to miss a dose. I noticed at the gym too, I was getting slower and weaker. Not so much that I was in 'bad' shape, but enough that it was fucking up my progress. If it had just been any one of these things on its own, I could maybe find a way to justify the benefit of relief Kratom provides. But together, it's actually a lot, and it's an insidious lot, so it's tough to see from inside it how bad it's gotten.

Finally, something that I'm only noticing now that I'm not using Kratom anymore (and this relates to the first problem): Kratom made me really okay with doing absolutely nothing. Even if I intended to do something, I'd dose, get buzzed and just lie there and relax. Which is an awesome feeling, but it made me miss out on things like taking an hour to write, or to make music, or to try new recipes (cooking, music and writing are my three creative outlets). It'd stop me from doing little things like taking walks, which I've done almost every day since I stopped dosing. I could get through work tasks that I absolutely *had* to do, but anything that wasn't required to live, I could justify not doing just for the simple sake of doing nothing. That routine 1PM (and then as things got worse an additional 7pm ) dose could *not* be disrupted, and the time that followed after that was either spent 'relaxing' (doing nothing) or taking on tasks I didn't love but had to accomplish in order to live.

And the thing is, when I quit two weeks ago, I already knew all this, because I'd previously gotten up to a 60gpd habit and finally quit in August 2018. At that time, the days, weeks and months afterwards were the worst. All I could think about was how boring life was, how long it had been since my last dose, was I really *never* going to have Kratom again? This on top of the insane withdrawal symptoms. I'd wake up and be bummed thinking that I wasn't going to get my buzz later.

Eventually I got sick of counting that time and used again. I told myself it would just be one time, just to show myself that I could use randomly, infrequently, and I didn't have to think about it all the time. Of course that evolved into a daily habit within a few months.

And this second time around of daily habitual use was definitely better in a lot of ways. I was more functional, had less brain fog, felt more like myself. I told myself I was just relieving some of the stress and boredom of life with Kratom, not giving myself over to it completely; But ultimately I wound up using twice a day, every day. Sure, way less than before but still a lot and I was completely dependent. At the same time, I was holding it down in life. Staying in shape, staying on top of my grind. And this is the time I really spent asking myself ""if this is my one vice, is that really so bad?"" I eventually decided it wasn't a vice that was worth it. Because it *was* slowing me down and it *was* keeping me from doing things like investing in my creative outlets. And those insidious little symptoms were all creeping up. But I honestly still can't say I'm 100% certain at all times that I made the right choice. I'm *very* confident *most* of the time that I did. But it's tough. Because even now, I'm facing stress and pain and frustration and I'm dealing with it, but it is *a lot* and any relief, I've got to figure out for myself. That's tough. If you're feeling that too, just know... it *is* tough. You're not alone in thinking that.

I finally bit the bullet and did a slow, slow, slow taper over the summer and finally got myself down to a dosage where I wasn't getting a buzz, but wasn't feeling withdrawal symptoms, got that down even lower and then stopped. It's been over two weeks now.

This time around, the loss of habit isn't as bad. My typical dosing times go by and I don't think about it. I don't wake up and think about Kratom first thing. I'm not really asking myself if I'll ever use again. And the withdrawal symptoms have not been as bad except one MAJOR one:  **I can't fucking fall sleep.**

I think it's getting better. The first night was literally no sleep. Last night it was a few hours scattered through wakefulness. It's so frustrating because it takes me like 1-2 hours to fall asleep and I spend that time so anxious about whether or not it's going to happen and if it's going to stick. And eventually somehow I drift off but if anything wakes me up (and now *everything* wakes me up), there's a good chance I'm not falling back asleep for hours.

For the first week, I kept checking this sub, and telling myself ""just get through the first week."" Well, I did and like an idiot set myself up for the expectation that at somewhere around Day 11, I'd just magically sleep 8 hours. I'm dumb. I know better than that. Like everything with Kratom, it's subtle. It *is* getting better, but slowly, one little extra piece of sleep at a time. It's just so frustrating. Saturday Sept. 28th, the night of my last dose, I slept 8 glorious, uninterrupted hours and every night since then has been a fight.

And I guess I just want to say to people who might be thinking about this or who are in the middle of it: Yes, quitting might not seem that great. If you're healthy, productive, and generally 'okay' while you use Kratom, *not* using can feel really of shitty, especially in the days/weeks/months immediately following. Like ""did I really stop enjoying that buzz just to feel depressed, anxious and never sleep???"" The benefits are subtle and small and come over a long period of time and I'm not going to bullshit you into saying you quit and everything feels better.  Sometimes this does *not* feel like an improvement. Like, awesome I go for walks now. Or, I sat down to write this insanely long-winded rant about quitting Kratom. But I'm also stressed from dealing with angry clients at work all day and I just want to get on the couch and nap in an hour but that isn't going to happen like it would if I were going to dose. But the fact is, habitual Kratom use is almost definitely holding you back from good stuff in your life. It probably doesn't feel this way, but the relief it's providing is probably not outweighing the harm that dependent use is causing, even though the the problems with being on it are as subtle as the benefits of being off it.

Thanks for listening. I hope my perspective helps someone. I'm not going to lie, I'm also hoping that getting all this out of my head helps me sleep. I've noticed that writing can do that. It's been 15 days since my last dose and I'm excited to see where I end up after 15 more. Good luck friends. Please message me if you want someone to talk to about this.

This has been so unbelievably rough.  Probably more-so than the first time because I had already caught a slight cold the day before I'd quit.  Rotten luck, but there's no way I was buying more after I'd already made the decision to never do so again.  

Despite my super-strong resolve and newfound sudden disgust for shoving green poison down my throat, today was a very, very tough day for me and I very nearly walked the 5 minutes to the corner store and bought some more Kratom.  

'Just a little' I told myself.  'Just to get through today... and make the withdrawal stop for a little bit.' 

But then I had a brief moment of clarity, and I ran to my computer, and quickly spent the last $30 I had in my bank account, on supplements that will help me recover quicker.  Mostly stuff that I've seen on the wiki here, some DLPA and Kava.  Boom.  Problem solved.  No money = no Kratom.

And then, a funny thing happened.  Right after I hit ""purchase"", the doorbell rang and it was the mail guy bringing a package addressed to me.  I'd completely forgotten that I'd purchased a bottle of Magnesium and some Ashwhaganda earlier this week, when I'd first decided I was going to quit Cold Turkey.  

I took the Magnesium right away, and it's been about an hour and a half... but you guys - I actually HAVE SOME RELIEF.  Mainly, the anxiety has somewhat subsided and the RLS, which is always the worst symptom for me, is minimized drastically.  

I don't know if this is placebo, but I'll fucking take it either way.  I bought the cheap Magnesium (citrate), which means I'm probably going to live on the toilet later.  But again... I'll take it.  I'll sing showtunes all the way to the bathroom.  

I hope this lasts, but even if it doesn't?  Just having that tiny bit of reprieve from the agony of withdrawal is enough for me to re-energize.  Keep going, peeps!  We can do this.  I just know it.",11,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5893269}"

Former username was ‘dougie9192’","I used to post and comment here frequently a few months back under the username ‘dougie9192’, it got suspended due to suspicious activity whatever that means. 

Anyways. Just wanna say that it’s been almost 2 months since I’ve tapered off of Kratom. Tbh I don’t know the date I just know my sobriety date from my last substance use on 9/9/19 which was just weed. I might’ve stoped Kratom in like mid to late August im not 100% sure. Looking back at my old posts it’s amazing how powerless I felt and how shitty my life was getting. I never thought I’d even get a day off of Kratom let alone weeks or months. Towards the end I was very suicidal and life was just awful inside of my head. Really, nothing physically has changed in my life as far as possessions or anything, I just feel a million times better

I’ve been back at the gym since and going hard. I’ve always been a serious gym goer but Kratom took that away. I’m eating a lot again, I lost a lot of weight towards the end of Kratom. Gained like 10lbs back. I’m not miserable at my job and I can appreciate now that I have a great job with great people and great benefits. I’m actually living life. I regained a relationship with my brother again. I talk to my parents on the phone, I don’t fuckkng hate everyone. I do my daily chores and don’t just not do them like I used to. Overall I’m becoming a productive member of life again. Simple things like scheduling doctors appointments and stuff like that I just couldn’t do before. 

So what has helped me(because obviously I didn’t just stop without any help) was going back to AA meetings. Taking it really seriously and not half assing it. I got a sponsor. I’m on steps 6 and 7 now, I go to several meetings a week and I call other addicts and alcoholics thru the day. I wouldn’t be here otherwise. While things are much better. It hasn’t been easy. Lots of anxiety and feeling like I couldn’t do this. But I have no other choice. There are things about AA That I don’t love but I have a great sponsor that understands my atheist views and he’s the same but he has me reading a bunch of books and stuff to help me get some sort of understanding. I just believe now that I have a higher self and I have my ego. We’ve studied Carl jung a bit. I try to focus on my higher self today and that ‘positive’ voice In my head. 

Anyways I don’t wanna make this about AA, thats just my experience and what has helped me. If anyone has any questions feel free to comment if you wanna know about WDs or how long it took to physically get better, etc. this is a journey guys. Doesn’t happen overnight. And there’s always work to do. I’m happy I made it thru the toughest part though",10,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4046353}"

Day 4 marked my stronggest showing at work in a while. And a great return to swimming. But on day 5 I got a sad unexpected shock, my Dad died. I've mentioned in other posts his decline due to parkinsons this year, but death this week was unexpected to say the least. So the last few days I've gone through that experience, still some WD symptoms around. My brother and I did his eulogy, and friends family and neighbours were amazing to us, both those things helped. I will be working through this for quite a while. Today the cravings for kratom have been quite strong at times. But i can only get it online, it's not in gas stations and head shops here that I know of. And anyway my last relapse was because Dad was getting so sick, so I may as well learn from my mistakes instead of repeating them. I can still smoke a joint or drink a beer. I use theanine and kava as supplements occasionally, and have actually been sleeping quite well, maybe because this is all so fucking exhausting. The site I used only sold powdered leaf, so I never got much into extracts or ever tried shots. maybe that's making it easier in terms of withdrawal. I hovered around, I'd guess, 10-15 g/day for six years, just a little relaxing routine at nights. I know now it was affecting me but I didn't fully see how at the time.

Was reading a post before writing this and I just want to say it’s ok to fail. I’ve failed more times than I’ve won. Trying to quit prescription opioids I failed miserably multiple times until I found Kratom. Then 3 years later after getting up to 60+GPD I failed again, and again, and again!

The only real failure in my opinion would be to concede to the fact that you can’t do it. That you can’t actually quit. Let me be a perfect example that it’s ok to fail, but as long as you try you’re going to be successful eventually! I know I have a LONG way to go with my recovery and nothing is guaranteed, but this time is different I can feel it mentally and it’s so encouraging.

It’s always the same: I take the stuff daily for a number of months, it turns into a problem so I quit for a week or two... and then I relapse every time. Right now I’m on Day 2 of a CT quit, I’ve been taking 20-30 GPD for maybe 3 months now.

At this point, I’ve been through this process enough times that I recognize all the physical symptoms, and I can deal with them. I’ve been taking some black seed oil for this quit and it definitely helps “taking the edge off” the symptoms. But the one thing I have by FAR the most trouble with... the cravings.

That’s why I always relapse. I’m a college student and I often take Kratom because I think “I don’t want to do this assignment, but if I take some Kratom then I’ll feel good while I do it.” But obviously that’s the addict in my brain talking, it’s not like the drug improves my academic performance at all. In fact, I know it hurts my performance because the Kratom makes me feel good even when I’m getting behind on my schoolwork and I should be worried.

So I just want som advice about mental strategies for getting past these cravings. I’ve heard about the HALT method, and today I bought a book I’ve been wanting to read for a while, the idea being that when I get a craving, I’ll just read my book instead. Seems to me that one needs to just distract oneself from the craving, because if you keep thinking about it then you’ll just overthink it and rationalize the idea of relapsing. Which is what I ALWAYS end up doing and it puts me right back at square one.

Anyone have some advice for this? I don’t want to be on this stuff anymore. But I’m constantly fighting this stressful battle with the voice in my head that tells me “just take a dose and you’ll feel better.”",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.56851184}"

I'm grateful to be at this point, and remember reading other quitters two month updates and just praying to make it that far.  And here I am.  Life has changed for the better, and it's constantly improving.  As far as specifics, first I'll share what still needs improvement.  Life can feel a little dull here and there.  Not constantly, but it ebbs and flows.  I have little motivation.  I started a Youtube channel almost a year ago and I had so much passion for it, but have let it go and I'm really struggling to find the motivation to start filming again.  This is potentially related to the dullness, and also to a lack of energy.  I occasionally wake up with a feeling of dread, but fortunately not nearly as often now.  Lastly, I still get uncomfortable goosebumps.  I'm not actually sure if I'm still struggling with body temperature regulation, or if I'm having a psychological reaction any time I legitimately get cold.  I hated the goosebumps more than most other parts of acute withdrawal, so it's possible that it's just me subconsciously remembering how terrible it was. I'm also gaining weight, because I'm eating terribly and having a lot of trouble regulating my diet.  I need to lose about 20lbs, so gaining is not what I want to do.  

Now for the good.  It's been incredibly freeing.  I went to a show with my mom and my toddler last weekend, and was overcome with gratitude when I realized it was the first time I'd gone to an event and didn't have to work out how I would hide my dosing while with my mom for most of the day.  I can go to work without worrying about whether or not I have enough to get me through a long shift.  I laugh way more often, and I feel things much more deeply.  I'm not as anxious/jumpy as I was when I used.  I have gotten my toddler out of the house at least once a week in the last two weeks, and even survived him losing his mind and screaming in the middle of the library while I was checking books out.  This would have caused an immediate panic attack before, but I was fine.  I was embarrassed, but normal embarrassed.  And I was able to strategize what to do next time I take him, to better prepare for a meltdown, rather than swearing off an activity we both enjoyed simply because he got upset at the end.  I'm creating better routines for my kids, and weve returned to sitting at the dinner table together.  When I was using I would get the kids dinner and then retreat to my garage and isolate myself.  I'm sleeping again.  Not perfectly, but I also work a job that doesn't allow me to have a consistent sleep schedule, which has a pretty significant impact on my level of fatigue. 

More than anything, when I think about my future it looks a hell of a lot brighter than it used to.  

If you're in the thick of it, please hang on.  Your bright future is worth every bit of your present suffering.  If I can help in any way, let me know.

Little history on affordable habits.,"Day 8 ct for myself. Or is it 9 now? I'm starting to lose count. That's a good thing I suppose. I'll have to look back at my posts latter and count it up. I don't know if it's been 1 day since I posted here or 2. If it's only been a day than it's day 8 I believe. If I haven't posted in 2 then it's day 9. Anyways.

   I've read quite a few other posts over the past week and I've noticed a commonality amongst a lot of stories. The financial burden that people incurred to maintain there addiction. Now, don't get me wrong, I've had a hefty pill habit in the past and I was spending 300-400 bucks on opiates every day or two at certain times (supporting 2 people's habit). But with pills, unless you get yourself a ligitimate script you're not getting a better deal then a dollar a mg. Just the way it is. At least where I've been.  Probably why so many people end up turning to heroin. Now, that doesn't mean I never tried to make it an affordable habit. 

   I would guess this must have been 6 or 7 years ago now. But I was in Oregon. That's right. Super left leaning, home sweet home, Oregon. One of my usual connections was out of the good stuff, however he had another guy he thought might pull through for us. He called him up and we headed over. Once we were there it was the same waiting game. I was supposed to wait in the car while my coconspirator went inside for the exchange of goods. This was the usual.

""Dude, you'll have to wait in the car. He's sketchy about new people.""

   I would realize momentarily this is just a runners tactics to keep himself between the fiend and the dealer. You see, a runner is basically acting as a broker that's facilitating the deal. They want their commission for services rendered. And hell or high water they'll get it. Even if it means robbing you two pills and making up a story about a price increase.

   After waiting for 30 or 40 minutes my boy wasn't answering texts or phone calls so I went ahead and shut off the engine, followed his trail and knocked on the door.

   Wouldn't ya know it. The guy that answered was one of the nicest drug dealers you'd ever meet. Shit, by the end of the visit he had offered me to live in his little drug shed with him if I was needing a place to stay. I wasn't. Good God I wasn't. Not in that ant infested, dirty dish, rust bucket of a shed.

   Point is, we basically worked out a deal moving forward that I would buy his script off him every month. Making it a more affordable habit. Great. Except he was in jail literally 3 days latter. Never saw or heard from him again.

   There was another attempt once with this super inappropriate old dude. Nothing ultimately panned out there either.

   Back to Kratom. Now here's a drug that is legal, plentiful, and readily available. This is the one that I was finally able to set up a whole little kratom press operation for literally a couple hundred bucks a month. 2 kilos, 2 press machines and a retarded amount of capsules.

   I guess my question for you guys is, why does it seem like a lot of people on here never looked into bulk amounts for cheap rather than paying over inflated head shop prices? Just convenience? It was that for us for a while but after tolerance builds there was no way we could afford that route any more. Probably the only reason we were ever off of it a week or two here and there in the beginning.

   As far as day 8. If I'm honest. I haven't ""dumped my stash"". It's still in my bag right now. Like 3 feet away from me. Feels like a waste of money doing that. I don't know what I plan on doing with it but there it sits. 

   I'm not having overwhelming cravings anymore. Still sluggish and lazy. Seem to be sleeping alright about every other night too. I certainly wouldn't be where I'm at right now without this forum that's for certain. If you're on day 1 you should absolutely lean on this community and post your progress. It's helped me so far.

I was a raging, binge drinking alcoholic about ten years ago with several hospital assisted detoxes. I was always pretty much recovered from those binges after a week or so. In my opinion, booze was way easier to quit than this shit.

Didn’t really intent to quit, I simply ran out and didn’t buy more. I was using around 12-15g per day I’d estimate. There wasn’t really a routine around it, I’d just use when I felt like it. I work in a call centre which is essentially soul-crushing work with no room for growth, satisfaction or anything positive really. So I’d get really fucking high, and chat my little heart out doing crosswords. Thanks Kratom. 

9 days ago I ran completely dry. Nobody I knew had any and it takes a minimum of 7 days to get more via purchasing it. 

So the first 4 days went by easy breezy, didn’t even know I was ‘withdrawing’ or anything. On the 4th night though, i went to bed as usual (I’m a rock-solid sleeper) and yet no sleep came. Not a wink, not a minute. RLS, baby. Oof, that is a fucking horrible experience. The next day I was filled with crippling, almost painful anxiety at another hospitality job I work. So day 5 and the symptoms of withdrawal kind of went from 0-100. 

The following night I obtained some Pregabalin, because fuck not sleeping. I know the risks, I know the rewards. I don’t have access to too much of it, nor do I intend on using it more than it is absolutely necessary. So I’ve been using that every second night, and will continue to do so until I can sleep again. The anxiety has completely vanished, even throughout the day when I’m not using pregabalin. It’s literally just RLS and insomnia now. From what I understand these symptoms usually finish by day 12, so pretty excited for that. 

I guess I’m writing this because it’s pretty weird that I’ve had minimal withdrawal symptoms besides RLS and a single day of anxiety.

You’ll have to forgive me, I’ve been in this hell so long that I don’t remember the numbers anymore. Everyday is the same that I remember from before. Wake up, dose. Go to work, dose. Don’t eat lunch, dose. Afternoon fatigue, dose. Go home, dose. Stay up late, dose. Sleep. 

Everyday. 

But it wasn’t always like this. I’ve mentioned this story before, as this isn’t the only time I’ve attempted to climb out of this hole. In 2015, I quite successfully from an 8 month habit. I started school and toughed through it. I made it well over 400 days. I had some close calls, sure, but I managed them. Until one day, I slipped. One single day and I fell down the mountain of sobriety that I’d climbed so high. 

So I relapsed for a couple of months, and quit again for a couple of months. Then I fell again. 

I repeated this many times. With each quit, my time on the mountain became shorter. Maybe lack of will, maybe fatigue. Or maybe, I never truly quit in the back of my mind after the first fall. I couldn’t tell you. Each time I quit, by God it was real. The pain was real, and the drive was real. 

Until the last time. 
I made it 5 days about 4 months ago, and couldn’t do it. I rationalized that I needed sleep, which was true. But not via relapse. I sometimes think of where I’d be now if I wouldn’t have done that. It makes me very sad. 

Huge things are changing in my life, which is the natural order of things. I think about sobriety every day. What would it be like, and how much I missed it. 

And I read this sub everyday. I read people’s experiences, and imagine myself there, because I will most certainly be there again. I want that mountain again. Permanently. 

Well, the time is now. And I’m scared shitless. Maybe my failures are all compounding in my head, and I feel hopeless. I’ve created the perfect environment to quit. I have supplements, I have 5 days. I am alone for the first time in a long time. 

It’s just me in this house. 

Which leads me to why I’m posting. 

I don’t want to bring anyone down by saying all of this. Because their are many people who walked out of hell and never came back. My story is not the only path. My story is a warning though, of how even after a long period of sobriety, you can fall. We don’t build sobrietal permanence without holding closely guarded safety protocols. 

I didn’t want to post for fear of people here thinking that I’m not serious. That I support continuing relapsing, that I am wishy-washy. 

But it seems wasteful not to reach out to this group, the group that has given me so much hope over the years. When I go back into my house, I plan to flush everything that I have, and weather the storm once again.  I am deeply ashamed of my failures. Very deeply. But I haven’t given up on myself. I know one day that wackiscrack will be okay. Because if I give up on me, I may as well end everything right here right now. And I can’t do that. I won’t do it. I’m a tough son of a bitch and I will make it out. 

So pray for me, send me good thoughts, whatever your preferred method of transferring ethereal good will is. 

I need it.

For me, these behaviors are being lazy and just laying in bed all day, which I’ve been doing for the past week or so when I’m not in class.

I have a good group of friends who invite me to come out with them often but of late I’ve been electing to just stay at home and lay in bed. I’m starting to realize that when I let my anxiety win, the Kratom cravings creep back up. 

Quitting is for sure a roller coaster, and I’m starting to realize that staying sober involves real substantive changes in not only routine, but combating the root causes of the addiction. For me, Kratom was a means for me to totally check out of life. I could detach from my anxiety and depression for a bit, all the while sinking deeper into the hole.

I’ve gone months where I didn’t even think about Kratom after I quit, to me it’s a myth that the desire to use simply dissipates with time - it’s tied to whether you’re letting the root cause beat you or not. In my case, whenever I let my root cause beat me, the Kratom desire comes back. When I’m on top of stuff and face my anxiety and go out and see my friends or run every day for example, the desire drops.

I feel really optimistic about this, have quit plenty of times so I know what I’m in for, but as I’ve tapered (hardly) I’ve come to realize that my biggest fear is feeling my own feelings. I unintentionally lowered my dose too far earlier this week and almost broke down crying twice. That’s okay though. I have a lot to work on with myself and I want to do this finally. I tried quitting a month or so ago and I’ve tried a taper recently and both failed. I have a three day weekend this week and I’m almost out (have to get through something for work tomorrow that’s very important to my career) and then it’s off to the races. I bought black seed oil and various other products recommended by this sub. But back to the reason for the post, I wanted to know how others experienced their feelings coming back to them full force and what they did about it. Currently I’m worried, but optimistic. I’m not going to die, I’ve got a clear schedule, and I’ve been forced to quit in the past I’m much worse conditions, the exception being every time I quit in the past I literally had no access to kratom. That last part will be a mental game changer for me this time around. I run from my feelings, the few I have. Oh, and to all of you who have posted here, thank you. I read nearly every story, comment here and there, and I’m grateful to have an outlet to say all of this.

I've been going through some relationship problems with my long term partner for over a year, a year that also involved anywhere between 12 - 24gpd of kratom. Usually a half dose before work and a half dose when I got back home. 

During this time, as my dependency grew, I became emotionally detached from things that used to make me happy. Unfortunately I was not able to perceive the slow emotional decline at the time and now, a little over three weeks off kratom, I can. 

It feels like an emotional bomb went off in my soul,  I'm lost and wandering through the rubble. The worst part is that it feels like the love I had for this person disappeared and I can't tell if kratom was the cause or the effect. I know it worked as a vicious circle, leading me slowly down into an emotionless pit. Now that I'm out, I don't know if my relationship will recover...

She said I failed for benzos and THA which are tricyclic antidepressants.  This didn't surprise me because 3 years ago when I was on kratom I was consistantly failing any 12 panel test for methadone and THA.  I remember I found out that I test clean around 30 hrs. coming off this stuff.  Probably wouldn't matter that much because it's probably just a mouth swab drug test  for employment today.

* I stayed on this dose for about 2 weeks, when it began to feel ""normal""

* the next 3 days, I cut that dose 1/2, to 3.5 grams per day (same schedule)
* midway through day 7, I took 1 gram at noon
* since then, I quit taking altogether
* When I quit, I began taking 5HTP, Valerian Root, Tuarine, B-vitamin complex, Caffeine in the morning, the 5HTP in particular works wonders
* I exercised during the worst parts throughout the process, which helped a ton

I've been fighting addiction to one thing or another nearly my entire life.  I'm a 33-year old female.

A few years back, I discovered Kratom and got horribly addicted to it.  It was the most detrimental thing I've ever been addicted to.  And yes, I've been through opiate withdrawal from Vicodin and Tramadol, but Kratom takes the cake as far as the worst ramifications in the aftermath.  It decimated my finances.  I was spending ridiculous amounts of money on it and lost everything.

Kicking Kratom was incredibly awful for me the first time around.  The withdrawal was all-consuming.  I became suicidal and depressed.  But there's a silver lining:  I went to the doctor, and was diagnosed with depression, got treatment for it, and finally rose from the ashes to live a normal, happy life again.

That is, until the depression came back after a few years.  This time, it was worse than before.  I happened to be in an area where Kratom is highly available every which way you turn.  I succumbed to the pressure, and did something I'd vowed never to do again:  I bought Kratom.  

At first, I had planned to only take a few capsules, just to get me through a particularly hard day.  If you're an addict, you understand how this spiraled out of control rather quickly.  Soon I was guzzling down 24 capsules at a time, multiple times a day.  I was spending 100's of dollars a week on this nasty substance, and eventually my life came crashing down again.  HARD.

You see, years ago, when I'd originally been diagnosed with depression and given medication for it - the doctors had only been half-right.  I wasn't Depressed... I was Bipolar.  Type 1.

A very severe bout of Mania occurred, and my life, as I know it, was absolutely decimated, once again.

I'm now staying with family while I wait for the Bipolar treatment to become effective.  They have no idea that I'm addicted to this drug that they've never heard of.   A drug that's available in less than 10 minute's walk from their house.

The other night, I was lying in bed, disgusted with myself.  I finally just made the decision, right there... that I would never buy a single capsule of Kratom again, as long as I live.  That the few doses I had left, would be my last.

So here I am, having just swallowed the last of my stash.  Tomorrow morning will mark the beginning.  D-Day.  And oddly, *I'm excited.*  I know this is going to be wretched.  I'm going to suffer.  But I don't fucking care.  I want to be done with this shit.  I can't stand having it in my body one more day.  I'm so happy that it's over.  I'll hate myself for making that decision tomorrow.  Oh well.  Right now, I'm relieved that the choice has been made.  There's no going back now.  It's over, and whatever comes next I'll just keep repeating to myself:

This morning was bleak, but right now, I feel o.k. Sneezing, anxiety, weird body sensations,  a stuffy nose is really not the end of the world.  I went to a 12 step meeting and got some relief.  My biggest pain right now is the loneliness, which Kratom did a great job of numbing.  A big cup of coffee did get me in a better state of mind.

For me kratom withdrawal is very dramatic.  One hour I'm spazzing out then the next hour I ask myself if I'm not just making this process seem a lot worse than it really is.  It is a process though coming off this stuff, that's for sure.  Someone told me I should go to a detox or something similar.  That would be an easy cash grab for them I'm sure.  I'm not going to go into that though.

I did this 3 years ago and remember it being about the same.  Basically my dread is coming from my life situation which is not that terrible.  I have a car, a roof over my head, and thank God I'm not in trouble with the law.  I just have to come back and face reality again.",10,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5864317}"

I’ve been on this subreddit a long time, but through a different account. Short backstory — I’ve been a kratom addict for about two years now. Around 30GPD. I quit early in August, and made it 35-40 days clean. The longest I’ve ever gone. To be completely honest, I felt pretty damn good, especially near the end of it. Life was beginning to have more meaning, and I began to feel truly happy for the first time in years. 

I don’t even know what prompted it, but I relapsed. My use very quickly came back to exactly what it was before I quit. I had meant it to not last nearly that long, but we all know how this shit goes. I’ve been putting it off because I’m so scared to do this over again. 

Anyways, today is the day I quit again, about 14 hours since my last dose. Do y’all think that this will be as bad as my last quit? I know the kindling effect can make it worse, but I also have still had more time off than on since quitting. I have no idea what the next few days/weeks will look like. 

Looking for any words of encouragement or motivation. Feeling pretty fucking disappointed and upset with myself for letting me fall back in,
especially since I was just starting to feel so good.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.43590984}"
2019-10-09 12:27:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/dfjgz8/do_you_have_a_green_backpack/,Do You Have a Green Backpack...?,"For the 3+ years I used Kratom daily, I carried bags of it, along with a spoon, around in the front pouch of a green backpack (I was a toss-and-washer). It was a simple bag that started out as a way to transport the things I'd need for the day and then slowly morphed. By the end of my time as a Kratom user, the backpack came to represent much of what was wrong in my life.

*I was tethered to it*. I spent more time than I can believe coming up with reasons to justify its constant presence with me. For my wife, it became a mind-numbing trigger. For my kids, it became a representation that something wasn't right with Dad. For me, it became a source of shame.

My relationship with the backpack was complicated. As it became more and more tattered, with shredded threads and busted, overused zippers, I started to feel less and less worthy...more and more enslaved. Over time, green powder worked its way into every crevice of the pack, turning it stale and stained -- which is how I came to see myself on Kratom. You might ask, ""Why didn't you just get a new pack?""

Because I just couldn't. A) I didn't feel I deserved it; B) I wasn't willing to destroy another backpack with the representation of daily drug use. So I remained stuck -- and stuck with it. I held on to a sliver of hope that if/when I was able to quit, throwing away that backpack would mean a lot to me and my family. It would be ceremonial. And that has proven true. 

There was great catharsis in trashing that thing.

If you have a green backpack (or your version of it), ridding your life of it can be a great motivator -- as much for the physical act as for the life that it represented! I've got a new backpack now. It's clean. It's never held Kratom or any other drug. It goes with me when I have things to carry. It stays home when I don't need it.

I have been battling addiction if I'm honest since I was 14. Both my mom and sister have seen it all and my wife didn't know what to do anymore. So they both flew put here which allowed me to check myself into the hospital for about 6 days which I was lucky because I don't have insurance at the moment and they were detoxing me pretty well. I'm also a stay at home dad at the moment so every attempt at CT I felt like I was neglecting my daughter's needs because I was so sick I could barely take her outside etc. If your a parent and going through this then you understand what I'm saying and even if your not you obviously still get it.

It seems like I have been down this road so many times before, and yet it gets me every time. The guilt sucks ... I've told myself countless times that I have to embrace the shitty days and just deal with it and push forward.

During the last two recent ""quits"", I kinda had it easy and didn't appreciate the danger of relapsing. I was mostly tired (well, lethargic) and felt like I had a light flu for about 3 days. 

Now, I'm really being consumed by depression and apathy. This indifference is scary. Nothing matters, nothing to be grateful for. The pleasure is gone and seems to be disappearing even deeper. I've always been afraid of this condition of the mind. I had a really good couple of months sober, things got real and noticably better, life returned to a rather normal and even happy state. I felt like I finally got ""unstuck"" and was moving forward with confidence. 
Then, about 5 months in, came anhedonia and indifference. Fake memories of kratom comfort started enveloping me. Surely I can control it and I'd rather be feeling that numbing comfort of kratom than face my despair. ""There could be worse things than taking kratom again"", addiction runs deep within me. Unfortunately for a few days I fulfilled that void. Kratom took over ... I fought, and quit for a week or maybe ten days, then mindlessly relapsed again.

 A few months later I had enough of this feeling stuck again, feeling nothing other than fear of withdrawal. Becoming indifferent, overweight and lethargic. Things aren't bad, but nothing seems to excite me anymore. Now I'm on kratom and feel empty. Both fears combined.

I tried to quit and relapsed after 8 days. Today I'm truly sick of it. I've learned many valuable lessons despite my failures. Kratom isn't going to work for me and even though I suffer with my anxiety and apathy, I have important things to hold on to, and give them my real, sober attention. I can't be grateful or truly express love and appreciation if I am high. My emotions are blocked.

I'll try again. I know I'm down to a few grams a day and I can taste the freedom. But with it comes the rocky road of recovery. I think it's time to embrace it and maybe learn something new about myself. I sincerely hope to be kratom-free by next week.

Got to the point where I was doing 30 grams a night, bingeing all night and taking more when the peak wore off.

The bingeing was in the last 4 months of my use. My withdrawals got bad, so I would take some of my moms pills from when she had to go to the hospital.
         
Would pop those until I could get more kratom. Kratom was ALWAYS stronger than the pills, even if I took 3 of them at a time. Hydromorphone 2mg. So, 2 months ago I decided I would quit kratom for good. Lasted 2 and a half weeks, and the pain was unbearable. I would start to cry realizing I could never have it anymore.

Then, I went and stole one of my mom's suboxones. She had been addicted to pills before and was put on those. All of my symptoms immediately left, and I felt like I had never even touched kratom. Took some more of those until she eventually found out.


Relapsed to kratom for a week, and then my mom and I started a thing where she would give me a little piece about an inch long and quarter inch wide. Would do the trick every time.  Give me one of those daily until it came time to our appointment. The strips were 8mg buprenorphine.

So at this time, she's been giving them to me for about a month. My tolerance to it was there, so I knew the doc would have to give me suboxone or I would be in a lot of pain.

So, I go in to the doctors yesterday. ""Kratom isn't an opiate, we don't prescribe suboxone for that as it doesn't work for it. We can try counseling and if that doesn't work, then some vivitrol.""


If you don't know.... suboxone has a thing called precipitated withdrawals, and it's far worse than normal withdrawals; like, several month long acute withdrawals. To take vivitrol, you must be through the withdrawals as it only helps with cravings, and doesn't stop withdrawals.


So... I'm screwed because of her ignorance. There are case studies of suboxone treating kratom dependence since, you know....... kratom is a partial MU opioid receptor agonist.... same mechanism of action as opioids. I can say first hand that YES, it does work...

Probably no more than a few hours. Maybe less. Withdrawal waves. That oceans a bitch.

  Now, I had a strange thing happen yesterday afternoon. I burped.

  Let's venture back a bit. I find myself constantly comparing the old opiate withdrawals to my current affairs with the green mistress. Let's talk triggers. Awe triggers. I first started hearing the term while riding the thirts mcgirts train back in Oregon years ago. The current girl friend's crack head mom would use the expression often.

 Now, back then it was just another term I so arrogantly deemed as a ""weak person word"". 
     
 ""Wanna come have a drink?""
 ""Nah man I'm triggered when I drink.""

 ""Wanna come hang out with us?""
 ""Nah man his garage is a trigger.""

 ""Wanna come watch me rail thirties all night?""
 ""Nah man, I'm trying to stay clean, that'll trigger me.""

  Despite what my parents might think, I have grown over the years. Even if it is in some twisted ways. But over time I've come to understand and appreciate triggers. Hell, I can't get into my truck with out looking at the center console thinking about the pills blown down on that thing. Not one grocery store parking lot that I pull into without remembering the waiting game for hours sometimes to meet the dope boy. God damn, my iPad just slides back and forth around corners under the back seat never in use cause when it gets pulled out there's STILL streaks on it from the last time we were crushing thirts and licking residue off the screen. I humbly admit now that triggers are, indeed, a real thing any recovering addict gets to look forward to. Probably forever. Awesome.

  So yesterday, I burped. And you know what didn't happen? I didn't taste a green plum of kra kra dust billowing up my esophagus and out of my mouth signaling an impending euphoria. Nothing. Nada. Just a regular, good old fashioned gaseous break down of digested food. Awesome, my first kratom trigger. And you know what the best part is? Ain't no avoiding that shit. It's not like you can just avoid burping the rest of your life.

Why I ask?,"45 year old, 60+ g/day user here for about about a year and a half now... Just now seriously considering a taper, and HOPEFULLY an eventual jump off.  This stuff has begun to give me terrible sleep (1 hour @ a time w/HORRIBLE night sweats and nightmares) going on for a few months now.  Also intermittent gastric distress (alternating constipation/diarrhea, shit smells like plants, and is usually forest green). I just started a new job about 5 weeks ago, so I can't really take time off this soon to do a rapid taper or CT, which I expect to be a pretty bad experience since significant withdrawal sets in after 10-12 hours post dose.  My dosage generally varies from 50-80 g/day, and on occasion over 100g.  The higher end on my working days to combat the pain and exhaustion (explained below) My doses are spaced 3-6 hours apart.  

I suffer from depression, panic/anxiety disorder, and PTSD, and take prescription medications (very responsibly) to treat those conditions.  I have never gone more than 12 hours between doses, so I have no idea exactly what to expect (except the possiblilites I have read in the Read First section, and other recommended sites) and want to be prepared for all eventualities...  I am truly afraid of what could be to come.  I have withdrawn from prescription opiates many times, but from what I have read this seems to be a more lengthy endeavor.

I began using it on my former job which was also very mentally/physically challenging to me for PAIN and endurance.  The painkillers I was taking a few years ago have become nearly impossible to obtain, and were actually not as effective as Kratom has been.  
Besides the psychological issues I have, I also have a broken back, neck (6 screws and a plate), and a completely rebuilt/fused foot (13 screws and 3 plates from a fractured calcaneus, and 5 broken TMT bones) from a very serious fall.

My main problem is how to taper while also being able to function at work without having the dosage spikes on my working days.  I have kept a spreadsheet over the last 6 weeks, and my average dose is still escalating, and a graph shows huge peaks and valleys in my average daily dose.  I want to quit, I just have my doubts if I can still hold a job without the actual benefits I have received from taking it.

Funny thing, this come down. Yesterday morning woke up feeling pretty good. By noon was lethargic and anxious. Come evening time after work, sat down and had a couple beers with a co-worker at our company house and felt fantastic. Slept like a baby on momma's perfect tit. Woke up this morning on my own just a bit before my preset phone alarms started chirping next to my head. Again feeling pretty good.

   I find myself already looking back 5 days ago and thinking ""Not to bad, pretty short for the worst of the wd symptoms to be cleared up already. I could do that again."" I'm not surprised. I would rationalize the same way after a hard two week withdrawal back in the opiate ""thirts mcgirts"" era of my life. Spend a month getting straight just to come back home and do it all over again because ""I can handle the withdrawals"". Just a perpetual state of addictive, psychotic rational to justify doing what makes you feel good whenever you want regardless of known consequences. Ha, that last sentence should be my ""About me"" section on eharmony.

   Pondering on this, among other things, this morning made me think back. It must have been about 4 years ago now. Myself and a good friend had planned a trip to Peru. Well, he had done all the planning, I was just along for the ride. I had already had two weeks off work before leaving so the pill use had been heavy and constant for at least 14 days. Regardless of this fact, I moved forward with the trip, snuck a Suboxone strip through customs (as if one strip would last at all.) Got loaded like a freight train just before my 8 hour flight and fastened my seat belt for the turbulence.

   Day one was no surprise. Got to Lima and came upon a sweaty, dirty, tubby middle aged drunkard flicking his nose at me and basically threw my money at him. Language barrier was defcon level 5. Just gave him money hoping he would return soon with some Peruvian driven snow.

   Amazingly he did return. With a good amount of the white stuff I might add. What I have not mentioned, and probably should, is that I always have some weird reaction a day after partaking any cocaine I have ever come across. My nasal passage ways completely seize up for days. Literally no breathing through them for a minimum of five days.

   Now what ensued I can only describe as two weeks of alcohol debauchery while in a state of full blown withdrawal while only breathing through my mouth for almost the entire trip. Every morning waking up early to catch the next domestic flight or the next train ride to whatever our next destination was. 
       
   I had saved my Suboxone for our trip to Aquos Calientes. At the very foot of Machu Picchu. That's right, the morning of, I slipped the last bit of Sub I had under my tongue and hiked up that fucker. All the way up. Every solitary step. Even in the state I was in, what an amazing place that was. I was at the top of everything and at the bottom all at the same time.

   It was the last 3 days there or so that I had snapped back to the land of the living. I woke up one morning, the fog had lifted and spent the last few days feeling better and better, swimming in the Amazon river with one of my best friends.

   After the return journey home wouldn't ya know it. Night number one I was on reset. Chasing Thirts mcgirts with a tooter on foil. Good God, two fucking weeks latter I was back at work withdrawaling all over again.

   I don't quite know why this came to mind this morning. I guess identifying how consistent I've been in the past at rationalizing that ""I've done it once I can do it again, it wasn't that bad."" Just another way of lying to yourself that you're a ""functional addict"". What a laughable term.

   Pretty sure it's a mental craving, as my body seems to be past the initial ""holy fuck I'm going to die"" 3 - 4 day phase. It's kind of hard, but thinking back to these times seems to help remind me what an out right lier I have been to myself about the entire shit storm.

I have used kratom on and off for years.  I have an issue with abusing opiates and justified my kratom habbit because of PAWS from poppy tea and Suboxone (at different times).

I've gotten some real bad side effects that I knew happened moreso after taking kratom, but never wanted to admit that I could have been causing my own issues poisoning myself.  I've started a very small taper from 30gpd last Wednesday. The issues I was having we're wide ranging and very painful.  I would have very had LPRD (food reflux), problems swallowing, and recently noticed that my feet have been very swollen, along with my whole body.  I've tapered from 3 heaping spoonfuls per day, boiled and strained with a paper towel, to 1 and a half spoons but it lasts me 2-3 days.  I take only very small sips of I cannot get over the restlessness.  I'll tell you though, now my body is not all swollen, not having issues swallowing. It used to be so very painful. Food would get stuck in my throat and right ear. I'd compulsively swallow to try to get rid of it but it never worked. Only after I stopped using such a high dosage did my circulatory system revert. I feel tingling in my feet and most of my appendges, even my head feels a bit tingly. 

I read that kratom is a vascular constrictor. This makes much sense and seems to line up with my feeling after stopping such a high dose. I plan on just stopping if I can manage to still work at the same place.  I use CBD flower to help with the anxiety and restlessness, it seems to work well

My question is has anyone else had such adverse effects from kratom? Stomach issues, swelling issues, swallowing issues, tightness in the chest?  I am getting older and are going to start a family soon (engaged to be married next year). I need to be healthy if I'm so sustain a marriage and move into the next phase of my life. I'm a bit afraid I may not be able to have children because of my drug addictions throughout my life.

My last dose was midday today 2mg. I've been able to cut my kratom dosage down from about 80g a day to 12-15g which is awesome.

But now I'm nervous I'll go through sub withdrawals because I'm waiting on my order to come in the mail overseas. Well what really happened was I had to wait for my BTC to be accepted in order to use it and I wasn't able to use it until Friday night. The vendor shipped it before 1am on Saturday and says it takes five days to ship overseas, which is true because of the ratings I've read on him. Very trusted vendor. 

But I have two questions: does Sunday count as one of those days to go through customs? Or will it have to wait until Monday to progress? It'd be great to get it by Wednesday if so at the earliest. I know Subutex has a long half life so I hope I won't have horrible withdrawals before then and have to increase my kratom intake before it arrives. And by the way I only used for a week but was stupid and was taking like 4mg a day the first few days, then skipped a day then 2mg doses until today. So I never got to taper correctly all the way down. And only planned on using it for a couple weeks to taper correctly.

So there's my two questions... Does international mail work on Sundays and may possibly receive it by Wednesday instead of Thursday or Friday? And is the half life long enough that I may avoid sub withdrawals and stick to my kratom taper? I'm going down one gram a day. Two doses morning and night shaving half a gram from each. Tomorrow I am at a total of 12g if things work out ok. My luck it won't arrive until next weekend and I'll have to increase my kratom intake which I don't have money for anymore as I'm starting a new job Sunday.... Thoughts, answers, advice?

I started out in my mid-teens with pain pills, as many do. I found that I really enjoyed them, and progressed to heroin by the time I was 20. I did heroin until I was about 22 and then jumped to poppy tea because it worked better, longer, and was dirt cheap at the time\*. I stayed high, with no significant clean time from 22 - 28. I was lost, trapped, and hopeless. 

\* Poppy tea is one of the worst opiates to withdraw from. Please stay away. I do not say this lightly. Imagine kratom withdrawal, multiply it 50x, and extend the acutes 2 to 3 weeks. Just don't.

Six months ago I found kratom and broke free. It was a total miracle for me, and I'm forever grateful that I got away from the more dangerous and life-ruining drugs. I planned on staying on it forever... My doses climbed, but I didn't care because I kept reading on other subs about how kratom withdrawals are a joke. This continued until about three months ago, when it finally stopped providing relief and I started experiencing interdose withdrawal. Then my hair started falling out en masse. Suddenly I was back to feeling lost, trapped, and hopeless. 

Well, fuck.

For the past two months I've been trying to cut back and taper, very unsuccessfully. It's been a constant struggle, and I haven't felt good or happy for a single day since I started trying to quit. I'd quit for a day and relapse. I'd quit for two days and relapse. I'd reduce my dose and say ""fuck it"" and go back up. I'd quit for a full week and relapse. It's been a long, miserable couple months for me. I've never been so divided between using and being sober. 

I had a week of clean time, and then a week-long relapse. Every day of that relapse was filled with anxiety and depression. Kratom didn't feel good to me anymore- it felt toxic and dysphoric.

This finally brings me to today.  Now I'm back on day 1, but it feels different. I woke up this morning a totally different person. I feel resolve that I didn't have a week ago. I feel commitment to the idea of a new me, and a lifetime without opiates. My head hurts but there is a clarity to it now. I'm freezing and feel off, but it feels like healing as opposed to illness.

For the sleep, I'll lay there until the whack thoughts start to come and try to sleep, then I'll get up, to take a walk and try again. Keeps me from thinking I'm totally alone and this will never pass. I will sleep eventually.

Cravings aren't horrible. It's hit me a few times but I have kept a running list of reasons I want to stop and things that will keep me going. I also have a one hitter that I've been snagging on occasionally.

The RLS is whacky so I kept heating pads on my calves which has helped a bit.

The main thing that has kept me going is I am forcing myself to be in the moment. Good god I do NOT want to be at the Zoo (it's one of the largest in the US) but I am focusing on him today. That and I have plans for the next 4 days. Pretty much constantly. I moved my workouts to 11pm because I'm not sleeping anyway.

Depression hit this morning a bit but I also I realized I'm also day 2 into a breakup so I can't imagine I'm going to be too happy.

In a few hours it'll be farther than I ever have made it. It feels different this time as I prepared and made arrangements. I'm also quitting for me. If you are either thinking of quitting or are on day 1...for sure you can do this. We are all doing it one step at a time and day by day. Prepare and then start. Reach out if need be. Also I can't stop sweating.",12,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43171617}"

I wouldn't have guessed on day 1 through 3 that I would sleep last night for hours uninterrupted with no aid from a micro dose. But here we are. RLS seem to be pretty well gone. Not quite as lethargic as the first 3 days. I'm not aching down to my bone marrow anymore. Still cold sweating like a mother though. I can deal with that. I seem to be getting waves of ""pit of despair unhappiness"" this morning, however they are passing within 5 to 10 minutes and I'm back to feeling quite well all things considered.

   I guess the second to second panic and pain subsided yesterday afternoon. I waited till the evening to tell the Miss's just in case it was a fluke. She was really excited for me. Said it made her Suboxone tapering methods feel like she's wasting time, prolonging the whole mess. I tried to encourage her but I know all too well. When your facing the days to come to be filled with Hell inside of you, there's really no one you trust. You ask everyone how long it took to get past the worst of it, trying to gather evidence you can use to lie to yourself saying ""this time I tapered enough."" Or ""it won't be as bad as I can remember."" Haha, it never works. Inside you know damn well you're in for one Hell of a ride. At least that's what I do.

   About a year ago I was attempting to massively cut back. I wouldn't say I was commiting to quit per say, just seeing how close I could get to the edge. When I got close enough, if all things felt right, maybe I'd go ahead and jump and leave the green powdered stomach concrete behind. This, obviously, did not happen. It was a full week of just waiting long enough that I felt like diaper shit most hours of the day except that hour or so immediately following a 3 gram dose every 4 or 5 hours. That would harbor the small relief I was looking for, but also would be the reason for not walking away then. 

   Point is, I know what she has to deal with when tapering. I think she believes she'll be able to just take Suboxone for a week, stop taking it and she'll magically be back to normal. She's not letting herself actually feel withdrawals at all. Wakes up, takes piece of Sub to not feel sick, pushes through the morning and maybe takes another piece in the afternoon, goes to sleep and repeats. 4 days now. I do wonder if that's ever a method that really works well or if the Sub method leads to dosing more often then not after feeling sluggish and lazy for a week? That was the result of ALL my taper attempts. After a week of sluggishness and crawling skin and no end in sight. Fuck it, pop some kra kra.

   I hope she can pull through with me. This whole endeavor was her idea.

   I've also noticed every withdrawal I've ever experienced comes along with weird thoughts and feelings about the past. Past relationships. Past events. What may have been if I would have made a different decision here or there. It's like a sad feeling of nostalgia for a time that never existed. It's really fucking powerful and I don't particularly care for it but it happens to me every time.

  Anyways, posting and reading comments yesterday helped me not dose in the morning when I was still violently aching. Had I dosed up in the A.M. I wouldn't have known how close I was to getting past that first big hump. Thanks for that guys.

  It's easier not to dose when it's just to get a little high. It's harder not to dose when it's to not be sick. If that makes sense?

   In case no one reads this post today.

I got through the withdrawals just fine due to phenibut (do not recommend at ALL), which I then also quit. Rebound anxiety got me and on day 7 I picked up a bag of kratom. I spent the next 7 days trying to enjoy kratom but I hated it. I was either getting no effect or straight to wobbles from 3 gram doses.

When I eventually ran out of kratom I decided to say ""fuck it"" and CT'd again. Today was day 2 and I wasn't really feeling bad. Slightly uncomfortable but really a breeze.. until the anxiety set in.

I scrounged some money and stupidly drove out to my local poppy seed store and bought some. Somehow my idiot addict brain convinced itself that it wouldn't hurt anything (I started kratom about 6 months ago from a 10 year opiate addiction).

Anyway, I made the poppy tea, but the store must have switched to a bunk seed brand because I feel less than I would have from a 2g dose of kratom. It took away some of my chills, but it didn't even touch this knot of anxiety and depression I feel in my chest and stomach.

I took about 800mg which is a fairly standard starting dose and wouldn’t be considered excessive at all. At first I was thrilled with the results, it completely eliminated my anxiety for that entire day and most of the following day and helped alleviate some of my other w/d symptoms.

On day 3 I started feeling way worse. My anxiety was twice as bad as it was before I took the Phenibut and I was so drained I couldn’t even get out of bed. I learned that this is referred to as “Phenibut rebound” and is fairly common. Day 4 was even worse than day 3. Then, out of nowhere, I found myself waking up on the ground of my living room with my fiancé looking down at me with panic in his eyes. I had just had a seizure.

I know that this kind of reaction is rare with responsible use, but the other symptoms definitely aren’t. Just want to make it clear to anyone that’s desperate for relief that Phenibut definitely isn’t worth the trouble. Get a script for gabapentin, it offers pretty similar anxiety and w/d relief without all of the negative effects.

   To be honest, thirts mcgirts was a couple years into the whole ordeal. It really all started in the great cowboy state of Wyoming. A good friend of mine first introduced me to the bonafied grandaddy of them all, Oxy 80's. That's right folks, this entire journey started off with the original hillbilly heroin. I was at first hesitant to start off here because this was not the start of the habitual drug use but it, indeed, was my first taste. Now, hit or miss casual drug use funded by someone else when they're in the mood to share wasn't quite enough for me to start seeking anything out on my own free time. However it was the taste I needed to know that I surely enjoyed the ride. It was months latter that a beautiful she devil I was dating at the time that the norm started to change. You see, I work in the oil and gas industry. I am gone for a month at a time and when I return home I enjoy two full weeks off with plenty of money to frivolously spend. After moving in together the routine was thus; get high, fuck, get high, fuck, go to work withdrawaling for two weeks,finish the following work weeks in good health, return home and repeat.

   Now, this lovely vixen fell hard. Like, really hard. The relationship didn't last long but all following relationships over the next few years followed the same cookie cutter pattern. A lot of people I rolled with never really believed me when I would tell them upon returning to work I would quit partaking all together and full on withdrawal for two weeks at a time routinely, but it is indeed the truth. It became my schedule. As you can imagine over time, it got harder and harder. Or maybe I just got weaker and weaker. Either way, the spiral had definitely begun, whether I would admit it internally or not.

   Moving forward in time. Skipping over a girlfriend or two. I was back in my home state of Oregon. This was the ""thirts mcgirts"" era I had refered to earlier. This would turn into the heaviest use period of the whole endeavor. I had met my current partner in crime and lover, who I am still with to this day. And boy, would I be lying to you if I said I didn't take her down with me. Now meeting her I was clean. 26 years old. Just got back from work. Plenty of money to throw around. She was newly 21 and didn't stand a chance when I approached her and offered her a drink. Not that I'm a super stud or anything, just that both our life conditions were perfect for the meeting I think. But the whirlwind relationship ensued and I settled right back into where I left off. Get high, fuck, get high, fuck, withdrawal at work, return home and repeat.

   There are plenty of details in between but pretty unnecessary for the overall arch of the story. A few years had passed, the public was getting wise to the pill problem and the drugs started drying up. Becoming harder and harder to consistently come by. The oil industry had a huge down turn and we faced a choice; stay put further spiralling down the inevitable path of the cheaper more abundant drug of heroin or option two, move to Pennsylvania closer to work and see the slow down through. Naturally we couldn't undertake such a long move withdrawaling the entire trip so the internet research began.

   Enter Kratom.

   I won't be a naysayer. Kratom did, indeed, do wonders staving off withdrawals. It was our addictive personalities I suppose that created the problem. I found a wholesale site that I could order 2 kilos of kratom at a time. Got a couple capsule machines and 5000 count bags of capsules and there you have it. An affordable way to intake all the kratom our febal little cerebral cortex's could handle. The hunt never really stopped. We came by a few super unreliable connections and got our hands on some opiates on the east coast here and there. But nothing consistent or substantial. We even did the Alpha Bay thing for a few months until the feds shut it down. Other than that, an over abondance of Kratom has been the standard for more than three years now. Over the years when we don't like the amount we have to take to get that ever elusive blanket of warm euphoria, we wean down our dosage a bit but have finally come to the edge of all things.

   So here we are. Day three of no Kratom intake, save for a small dose at night the past two nights as I mentioned previously. It's not easy. Let me clarify, it is indeed far easier than opiate withdrawals. I wouldn't wish that shit on Putin. But it is definitely no walk in the park. When the answer to your physical woes is as legal as milk and I could literally dose up right fucking now and feel better. Fuck me, haha.

   I did not intend for this to be a tale of pity. I don't want or need that. Just my way of laughing myself through it all. Damn it I love a good comeuppance.

   That's it, it's a long one. Sorry for that. I'm sure it's too long for most to read through and I don't blame you. If you made it this far I hope the journey was somewhat enjoyable to read anyways. However pathetic the read was.

   Cheers guys, I hope to God this state my body is in subsides soon. Writing this definitely seemed to do wonders to get me out of my head for a bit.",9,{'epidemic': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4839928}"

For the last 2 years I've been numbing the anxiety and stress of growing into adulthood with Kratom. My life was not where I wanted it to be, and I had recently lost a lot of footing before I was offered Kratom. 

Fast forward 2 years and I'm worse off than I was at the start, I was clearing $350/month on Kratom alone, rather than paying off debts I have. I had turned into a sedentary shut-in, with no hope of building a future for myself and my fiance whom I love immensely. I wanted to quit and reclaim who I was before Kratom, but just couldn't manage the withdrawals.

I went on my usual run to a shop down the street from my house before work to pick up a bag, when I arrived I found that the entire stock was gone, and would not be coming back. I took this as a sign and decided it would be the day I left this horrible phase in the past.

For 3 days I endured the hell of those withdrawals I had been avoiding for 2 years, at one point I actually thought I was going to die from lack of sleep.

Now, after having 2 good nights of rest, lots of exercise, and returning to actually eating food, I am feeling much, much better. I know there will be challenging times ahead and that cravings will come and go. I have made a promise to myself to NEVER let myself slip back into a hole like the one I was in.

I'm only calling it CT because I don't even have as much left to taper with as I'd planned. What's the point in going out and buying another bag? I don't think there is a point in doing so. I don't want to spend another dime on this nasty garbage.

Long story short, I made the jump, it was a big one, on the evening of Sept 29th and then had 3 most uncomfortable ~~days~~ nights. I expected it to be more like the past few CT experiences earlier this year, where I was able to get at least 4 hours of sleep the first night, and a few more hours the next few nights, getting better as I moved along. Instead, I got next to no sleep for 3 nights straight, so, being very afraid of not getting enough sleep before a workday, I bought a small bag for tapering purposes.

I think that if I was able to function at all during the daytime those 3 days, I can make the jump relatively safely. I know I can do it. I am keeping a ""goal card"" in my pocket with an image of the kind of car I'd like to afford one day. It's like a constant reminder of why it's sooooooooooooooo important to be off kratom. I'll create more/ add more imagery in the future.

Supplements I've been taking to avoid discomfort as much as possible are: Black seed oil, Ashwagandha, Rhodiola drops, turmeric, cacao powder with coffee, magnesium glycinate, melatonin, MSM, Maca root powder, Vitamin D, chamomile tea... I'm sure there are some others I've missed.

My dosage slowly grew over time and I did have minor cravings every so often, especially when I only took 1 dose at night in the beginning. The cravings were less like this all-consuming thought in my head and more of just something that I was looking forward to later in the day.

Those cravings pretty much were non-existent for me when I went to 3-4 doses each day. I probably just kept enough in my body throughout the day that I did not NEED more immediately. I normally would go at least 12 hours with no doses every day. I took my last dose each day around 9pm and then took my first dose in the morning around 9am. I never really felt anything I would recognize as withdrawals. Maybe I was more tired and depressed in the morning than I should be and it was easy to blame it on kids keeping me awake or normal stress. It's hard for me to retroactively figure that out.

The reason I chose to try quitting is that I think using Kratom was making some muscle tension problems worse for me. I have not cut back enough for a consistent period of time to even know if that was really something Kratom was doing to me. Cutting back has really shown me how dependent my body was on Kratom and I really wonder if it was negatively impacting me in ways that I never noticed. The weird thing is that I don't think I will be able to feel good taking Kratom again. Even if I went back to my original doses, I think I would feel the withdrawals now. Maybe I'm just hyper-aware of them because I've been feeling them to varying degrees for a month. At least that means the only option that is acceptable to me is to find a way to quit.

I want to get used to lower doses and then start a taper.,"After almost a month of starting to quit, I had jumped around a bunch from a few days of CT, low doses for a few days, CT again, low doses, etc. I had settled on fairly low doses for a little more than a week, but wasn't feeling like my brain and body were balancing out at all to set myself up for a taper. I wish I would have started my taper at a higher dose rather than going down to 3-4 gpd immediately when I started at around 15 gpd.

For the past couple of days, I have found somewhat of a balance of cutting my original doses back, but not feeling absolutely terrible all day long. I am now at about 6-8 gpd. I feel a little better and can actually get some sleep. My goal would be to stay at this dose until I feel somewhat normal again and I was hoping that would take about a month. I then want to taper like 10% each month after that to minimize withdrawals.

The depressed feeling is what is really affecting me and I really want to try to let that subside before cutting back more. Am I delusional though? Am I likely to even feel any better at these lower doses before cutting back more? If I wait a month, is it likely that I will feel a little less depressed?",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.47909883}"

I hope  this make sense? Because as some of you know i was taking phenibut in a mixed  supplement for months and not know it was in it. i did not think my little discomfort was from the phenibut so i was not thinking of taking more to feel better. I thought i was having an off week.

I was at around 35 grams/day for the last year or so. I was on K for a total of 5 years. This wasn’t easy, I don’t care what anyone says. My first 15 days were awful, for me the anxiety was the worst part by far. I felt like I was having a heart attack constantly. I did an extremely fast taper (if you even want to call it that), for fear that my shit willpower would force me to say screw it and just keep taking it. I went from 35g to 20g for 2 days, then dropped to 10g for 2 days, then to 5g for a day. I felt like shit on 5g so I said whatever, and just stopped taking it at that point. 

I’ve never been so tired and not able to sleep in my life. My legs have never felt so heavy but not able to sit still. It was like a cruel joke the way I was feeling. Concentration? Yeah right, all I could think about was how much I wanted to swallow all the Kratom. That’d make me feel great. I didn’t though. I am so much better for it. Now after around 15 days the anxiety got better. Not gone, but better. I had no anxiety issues before this. No issues at all actually, just took Kratom because it made me feel better than usual. So I have no excuses. I did this to myself, selfishly. After like 30 days I noticed I was becoming myself again. I was just sharper overall. Like I wasn’t in a fog all the time, I’m pretty sure it was making me dumb and I didn’t even realize it. 

I never really had issues sleeping after the first few days, maybe 4 or 5 days, and just a few nights of RLS. When the RLS left I could sleep. That was a bitch. Anyone who has that for an extended period of time I feel for you. Now I can sleep all night no issue. 

This is a little scattered I know, but I didn’t really document anything so I’m just writing what’s coming to my head. 

Now I don’t have to eat that green shit 7 times a day or whatever. I don’t have to go to public bathrooms with a bottle of water like a weirdo to dose. I don’t have to figure out how I’m going to hide kratom on me all the time so I have it whenever I need it. I don’t have to clean the bathroom sink constantly so my wife and kids don’t see my green mess.  I don’t have to wait for the mail man to pull up to My house when I’m waiting for a shipment (shipment delayed used to make me So Mad). I don’t have to plan my meals around when I want to dose. I don’t have to throw 50/week at a habit. There are a lot more things that quitting made so much easier. If you are reading this you get the point. I’m gaining weight back so people don’t think I’m sick anymore.(was 230lbs got down to 175, back up to 210 since quitting)

I just wanted to post because I have been reading since I decided to quit and I think it helped knowing it’s possible and it gets easier. Get to 30 days is my advice. That’s where it’s at.  All I took was vitamin c and multivitamins and Imodium of course. I did eat some cbd gummies at first. It might have helped with the sleep. I don’t really know. I think time is the only thing that really helped me. Just had to suffer for alittle while to pay the piper. I didn’t miss work (it sucked bad), and had to take care of my 3 and 5 year old the whole time. None of it was easy, it was horrible actually but You will get through it if you really want to quit.

I have a few Ativan for emergencies only

Collagen peptides for recovery/nutrition

I wish I could say I've been completely clean on my entire acute withdrawal journey, but unfortunately, on a desperate day full of stomach issues I got some Loperamide. Also, unfortunately, my addict brain took over and knew if I took higher quantities I could potentially get high. Well, I didn't get high (I hear you have to take quantities that could possibly kill you due to heart difficulties in order to achieve what is a lame high). I said no more after that, but then addict brain took over, and I took it again, and a third time for good measure. That third time worked because I took a few pain killers I had found (could lope be the gateway drug to real opiates? I think so.) LOL. 

So somehow, through all of this, I thought I had gotten through the withdrawals, and miraculously they weren't coming back. Well 2 days after my last lope dose, they start coming back a tiny bit, but I still thought this was normal, not accounting for the lope leaving my system. So genius me in a delusional state decides, damn, the cravings are here, it's been a week since my last dose of Kratom, so I'm going to take my old prescription of Naltrexone now. Well kids, this is why they say you should always have a Doc to medically assist your detox. I ended up throwing myself into precipitated withdrawals to my surprise (and not to your surprise), with some of the worst stomach issues I hope to have this decade. I was actually worried that my neighbor a house over would overhear my screams of pain and be concerned enough to do something about it. Thank god I had some leftover Seroquel (which works wonders for me to get to sleep when I'm feeling bad - it's not addictive, right?), clonidine, trazodone, and then took some Valerian root and melatonin. I was definitely concerned I took too much for my system but I wanted the relief more at that point in time (even if relief meant death? I don't know. I was insane. Please don't yell at me!). Yep, that addict brain once again, being frivolous with the pill-popping for instant relief without concern for their long-term health But hey, I got to sleep once the pain subsided, which was probably about 4 hours after I had precipitated withdrawal. I woke up not hating life as much, and well, alive!

I'm now 2 days out from that fateful day, and feeling muuuchh better. But the story isn't over. The reason behind me feeling much better, possibly, is because on the day of the precipitated withdrawals, my stomach was such a mess that I got desperate, and bought some Loperamide again once I could stand. Yep, you read that right. Sweaty and smelly me went to my closest CVS, thought to myself, hey let's do this rodeo again, even though I didn't get anything out of it the first time. I think I was also looking to see if I could reverse my precipitated withdrawals if there was any slight chance of it. Didn't work, and at least my opioid receptors weren't messed with. But I woke up the next day, and there was that bottle and my terrible, awful addict brain. I should have gotten rid of it, but I didn't, and tried again, which obviously didn't work. I threw the rest in the toilet, which was the very first thing I've done this whole time that was intelligent. So now it's 2 days out from that, and I'm holding desperately to the idea that maybe that didn't put me back too much. I can't go in and out of acute withdrawals forever, right? 

Well here's the situation, I won't be unemployed forever (actually had a job interview right before a took the Naltrexone, thank god I waited! It went well too!) and if I don't get my shit together now, I will go back to using in order to make it through my workday, especially since I need to use the full capacity of my brain since I work with databases. My mom is flying in tonight to visit me tonight (she knows I've been detoxing, everybody does, just not my stupidities during detox), so that'll help. 

Well there you have it! This is my cautionary tale of using Loperamide during withdrawals. It doesn't have any positive side effects, and you WILL regret it. Also, if you have used it, you still need to wait apparently 7-10 days after anything until you take your naltrexone!! 

Oh, and please reserve any judgments to yourself if you have any inclinations to do so, I'm pretty sensitive right now! I absolutely will be going to meetings again also, so never fear.  Please please please, positivity only!",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.51785004}"

I still get the manic pink cloud days where I'm just stoked on life and productive as hell but the waves of depression and anxiety have gone away.  After good days I just go back to normal days. 

I definitely sometimes get stressed or upset at things, but it doesnt send me into a full day or days of negative emotions like it did in the beginning.  

My flare says December 14th but I've only dosed kratom once I believe since then and before that had some good stretches...each quit getting better and better until here I am now....actually feeling like a normal human, able to recognize my.issues and deal with them without being brought down by fear and anger.  

I go to counseling now, eat way better, work out 4 or 5 time a week (very hard workouts), sleep at the same time pretty much every night, and socialize as much as possible.  I recently quit marijuana about 2 weeks ago and I realized that pot of all things was what was holding me back from full recovery. Quitting pot was more beneficial to my mental health than anything.  

Just a message of hope here.  It does get better and while I know the 14 or so years of substance abuse hasnt been completely erased, I'm finally in a place where I want to live again.

Point of my post is to just encourage those of you quitting and tapering that things absolutely get better. I thank my long taper for letting me establish a healthy routine in life so when I jumped, it wasn't such a hard impact. 

In just this short time, my hair loss has completely stopped. I'm hoping it will regrow over the next few months. My teeth have stopped hurting and they aren't as loose anymore. I don't crave sugar constantly and actually am able to eat enough protein to support my frame. My strength is through the roof. I can feel testosterone raging in me right now. I've been pathetically deficient for a half a decade. My lifts are going up in crazy increments. Breaking two of my personal records for compound lifts and literally every single record for isolation lifts. Some of my lifts are up 50% in just two months of steady exercise. My mind isn't racing constantly with nonsense thoughts and I haven't had a single fight with my gf in a month. I just don't feel that need to fight back over stupid stuff. I just let it go. I've been way more interactive with my son too. Totally was neglecting him, but I'm more involved than I have ever been. Been knocking on wood all day. Praying to who or whatever is listening that I can maintain the strength to stay off kratom, oxy, hydrocodone and opium. 

In the meantime, I'll be adding naltrexone to my life. A nice slow increase since I'm already having sleep and digestive problems so I don't want to worsen them. Did 50mcg today and will double every day until I stabilize at 1.5mgpd and evaluate.

Now within the past couple weeks I’ve had severe negative side effects honestly completely outweighing the positives. I stated experiencing extreme sluggishness, felt like I was constantly high and in a dream like state all day everyday. The deciding factor for me quitting was in the past week or so I’ve experienced extreme eye wobbles making it impossible for me to focus on ANYTHING. My short term memory has been utterly shot also.

I’ve never been dependent on any other opioid so I have nothing to compare it to, but for me it’s fucking hell. 

My package came in yesterday so I’ve been taking extremely low doses to just keep the WD’s at bay. I was at the point of going through 1/2 kilo every two weeks. I’m broke and can’t afford to keep this habit up and quite frankly, I want off regardless. 

I could barely function or get out of bed. I have a toddler to take care of, I’m a single mom and I need to be able to function while I’m quitting. I’m going to try to taper but I want off fast so I’m wondering if medications would be my best bet to help get me off. I have Medicaid so my prescriptions are free. I can’t afford to buy supplements like most people recommend on here. 

I’ve called a few IOP facilities near me and they all require inpatient detox. I can’t do that either. I’ve seen people recommended Clonidine and gabapentin among other meds. So I guess my only option at this point is to go to a doctor, right? How do I ask for these meds? Do I tell them I have neuropathy, etc. so I can get the gabapentin? Idk what to do. I feel at such a loss. 

This plant is fucking powerful and I’m so mad that people told me it’s just like coming off coffee. It’s not. Coffee WD doesn’t make you bed ridden with an intense flu for days. Like fuck. Any and all advice is welcome so I can stop being a slave to the sludge. 💔

I recently started reading “The Power of Habit” in an attempt to understand why I keep automatically assuming Kratom is an essential part of my daily routine.  

-	I have a 1.5 hour long commute to work in the morning.  I would dose at the start and end of the commute, mostly out of boredom, as well as trying to get “in the zone” for work.
-	Same 1.5 hour commute back home at 6 PM after a 10-hour work day.  I felt I needed to be awake when I got home to cook, clean, spend time with the kids, help them with their homework.
-	Anytime an event in my life came along that scared or upset me?  Ran to get Kratom.  It has become a habitual coping mechanism.
-	Any time my SO would complain that I wasn’t doing enough around the house, I have convinced myself that the extra boost of energy from Kratom would give me the motivation to finish whatever I need to. (Spoiler alert: it did not.)

There are plenty of other habitual behaviors that I experience daily that feed into my compulsive need to dose with Kratom, and I’m trying my best to pick them apart one by one to attack this issue at it’s very core.  I don’t want to go through the hell of quitting Kratom just to fall back into these bad habits with another, potentially more dangerous substance.


Has anyone else here noticed habitual behaviors that lead them to continue Kratom, either consciously or subconsciously?  What were some of your stories of success in changing these behaviors?

Anyhow I’ve read a lot of threads and had to make an account because no one else is talking about it. I’ve been on Kratom for almost 2 years and the last 9 months have been anywhere from 35-50 grams a day stretched into 3 doses. It has been my experience that any type of Red leafs, whether Bali, Maeng da, Borneo etc have given me the worst of the physical withdrawals. I have also noticed that even green leafs like a Malay or what have you those were bad coming off of but not as bad as red. So during my many ventures into this “miracle drug” I finally did find a leaf that worked for me and had the least amount of physical withdrawals which was a white leaf Borneo, a couple different brands but always a white leaf. I noticed I could space my doses out further than any other colors, the WD didn’t come on as fast or nearly as hard as the red or the greens. So the last 3 or 4 months I’ve been on just white leaf and coming into day 6 I feel absolutely great compared to 10 hours off a red leaf or green leaf. Day one obviously sucked, felt like the flu, I had to work a 12 hour shift but I got thru it. Day 2 was my first day off of a 3 day weekend and I wasn’t as bad as I thought it was going to be. The first three days I missed a lot of sleep but was never tired much, I had the RLS, lose stool a little bit, I was weak and didn’t eat much and was definitely depressed but I kept getting a rush of happiness knowing that I was another day down. I feel like my day 6 is gonna be great, my appetite is back and my positivity is thru the roof. I guess the conversation I want to start is I want to know everyone’s opinion on what color leafs you have been taking. I’m curious if the answer to quitting Kratom is taking a white leaf for a little while and then just be tough and grit your teeth, tell family and friends you got the flu and in less then 4 or 5 days the grass is the greenest I have ever seen.
