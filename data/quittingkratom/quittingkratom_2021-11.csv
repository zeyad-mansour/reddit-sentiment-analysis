I've tried and failed. Thinking about quitting kratom feels like I'm losing someone I love. I never thought I'd be here but I am.

I can't escape the desire to feel the buzz. I'll lower my dose to just maintenance for a few days and then get right back to my usual doses. I'll actually be excited about my lowered tolerance. 

It's like there's 2 sides of me: one that wants to quit and get my life back and another that is desperately holding onto this substance at all costs. 

I've tried cold turkey. This was a complete failure. I've tried tapering. It worked better than CT but I still end up going for the buzz again.

Do I not have the willpower? Am I just not ready yet? Am I going about it the wrong way?",19

I never had issues while on kratom except for mild constipation here and there. I used to eat whatever I wanted and never had many issues, but now it seems like anything I eat gives me lots of bloating and cramping with poor quality stool. Quitting is totally worth it by the way. I don't have any desire to go back, I just want to get healthy and do what I can to manage this stomach stuff. Anyone experience anything similar? If so, what worked for you? I've been taking probiotics for a month and have started eating healthier with more fruits and vegetables in the diet. Going to see a doctor soon, I just figured it wouldn't hurt to see if anyone else has had similar issues from quitting kratom. Thanks for the help and stick to your quits everyone! It's worth it!",4

I realized just now that since I didn’t immediately turn to binge drinking this time around, this might be the longest I’ve been sober in the last 5-7 years. I’m actually getting really tired of hurting my body. I’ve been treating it like shit for the last 15 years and expecting it to perform tip top for me. 

I realized and remembered that I have a really hard time in the evenings. What do sober people do at night? I get this feeling which is hard to describe but I’ll try. During the acutes everything sucks so nighttime sucking is expected but now that I am feeling much better physically, this hit me head first. 

The feeling is like a feeling of something or everything being not right/ not okay, mixed with boredome, mixed with not feeling at ease and safe and chill and happy, mixed with lonliness and some anxiety. I used to get this feeling all the time as a child and teenager. I’d freak out at bedtime as a little kid. I’m sure there were good nights but right now I can only remember this feeling. I think of it as the after dinner or dinner feeling. I always hated dinnertime partially because of this feeling. Honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if I have food allergies and this is just an allergic reaction everytime I eat or something. 

I always turned to Kratom or alcohol I think in an effort to run away from this feeling. The bads are too severe so I don’t want to go back and I’m not romanticising it but Kratom did always do an amazing job of making me actually enjoy my evenings. I never had these feelings on it. I always felt like things were more or less fine. Alcohol could blur out this feeling for several hours if I got drunk enough, but I would pay in feeling shitty other ways in middle of night or morning and overall deteriorating health. 

If you read all this, what do you think is going on here? Is it just anxiety? Do you guys get feelings like this? Is it normal? Do sober people feel better than this at night? Now that I am actually an adult my mind is starting to recognize shit like this more and in a way it’s harder to deal with. I know eventually the bad feelings will go away at some point, but it kind of really sucks never feeling good at night. 

Another part of me thinks our societal living is kind of fucked up and that’s why I feel isolated and scared at night. When we lived in tribes we would settle in with each other and band together at night, wind down, and sleep together. Now, everyone is so separated, even in families people sleep in their own rooms. Could it simply be this? 

I know I need to just accept the feelings since they’ve been there since childhood it probably isn’t going away. I miss being able to enjoy the evening and watch to look forward to bed time and watching tv before bed again. The days right now are get up, work, be bored at work, come home. Be bored and feel shitty. Try to go to bed and not sleep. Do it all over again. Shit kind of not fun at all.",12

Its much harder in a psychological aspect, as im not getting nearly as physically sick from wds. But psychologically it has been a whoooole different battle. My life is in a much better place than when i initially quit a year ago, but i never changed the behaviors that i have known since and before then that I need to change. And this quit is difficult, im on day 3 today, and im finding myself frustrated because there are so many things that i could do and want to do on kratom, but dont because im just sitting around high thinking about it. But right now in withdrawal, it feels so hard to get up and to actually start doing something, and when i do, i get distracted really fast and find myself staring at the wall or at my phone again. 

But today I made a list of all the things i can possibly think that I want to do, and to be honest its pretty fucking long. And i realized, that i do pretty much none of this when im using kratom or drinking heavily, and even now as im sitting around my house on my day off feeling shitty and lonely, ive been doing exactly what i want to stop doing, and im never gonna really feel better and get on with my life if i dont get off my ass and start just DOING STUFF

That is i think the biggest thing kratom has taken from me. That and alcohol allow me to do nothing but watch stupid TV and youtube and text my friends and work and be okay with a life like that living with my parents. But in a month im going to be on my own, and I have to have a clear mind. If i keep taking kratom, im only gonna have more and more excuses to postpone withdrawal, so here we go i guess. I love you all and thank you for being here.

I just wish i didnt think about this so much. Like i wish i didnt wake up and the first thing that comes to mind is smoking taking or drinking something. But only by actually forcing myself to do things will i get out of this.",8

Started off with major depression and anhedonia from Days 1-20 with major insomnia. Days 20-33 were good, started feeling like myself again. Days 33-38 the depression and anhedonia returned. Days 38-45 were OK. Got a sinus infection around that time and started Prednisone on about Day 50 or so and the depression / anhedonia of the 1st 20 days returned with a vengeance. Stopped taking the Prednisone suddenly at the advisement of Docs and went through a shit week of terrible sleep (waking up with adrenaline starts as suddenly as I would fall asleep repetitively all night).  The Thanksgiving holiday was ok with sleep and I also felt ok as long as I was busy. Last night the lack of sleep returned with a vengeance, the same shit - fall asleep for 1-10 minutes then suddenly I'm jerked awake. Its maddening.

Depression runs in my family pretty heavily, mom and dad both have it. Alot of aunts/uncles/cousins have it too.

I am concerned that I have really fucked my brain up with my kratom use - I had a 1 year stint of 10 grams per day, went CT and went through about a month of major depression (which corrected) and quit almost a year then pandemic hit and I got back on it for a 9 month stint as 10-15 g/day. I cant help but think that the kratom actually masked true depression that I already have, given the family history. 

Doesn't help that I went to a doc last week and AIC and blood sugar were high, including elevated liver enzymes. 

I'm just a big huge mess here at 66 days Kratom free - when I feel that I should be getting out of the woods. My psych and therapist want me to start taking Buspar for my anxiety and I'm sure SSRIs are next. I don't want to take these meds if I am just going through a kratom WD process and my brain will eventually equal out. It did last time I quit....

Anyone with advice?

The anhedonia and depression always take me back out.

I never thought Kratom was bad. I never thought I suffered consequences from it. This time around I did. I was losing my hair, I looked like shit, I would sweat or be freezing whenever I didn’t dose. I was lying and scheming. Eventually my girlfriend and some of my closest friends couldn’t handle it. k helped ruin a four year relationship.

I guess that the real accomplishment that I’m trying to share is that I woke up this morning obviously sore and feeling like shit, but instead of thinking “I need kratom more than anything else in the world right now, get me some kratom at any cost” I thought to myself “I’m totally ready to face a day of withdrawals.” This is a big deal to me because for the past few days I realized that I’m absolutely ready to be done with this addiction, that after four years I’m ready to quit, but I was ON KRATOM while having those thoughts. It’s so easy to feel motivated to quit while actively taking kratom, but maintaining that motivation while withdrawing is the hard part. In my experience anyways. So I’m very happy that I still feel motivated. 


I know that I still have to face the hardest part of withdrawals over the next two or three days. The flu like symptoms have already kicked in for me (I get them after six hours of no use because I was dosing literally every hour) but I’m feeling confident in my ability to handle them even when they grow in intensity.

Now my body feels normal and I hitted the gym today. Only that anhedonia is still persistent. 

Do I have to quit tobacco also to get rid of it?

Will I ever be normal and if yes, how long will it take?

Im desperate because my son was born 3 months ago and I feel nothing for him :(",7

But now we are aware. We are awake to the knowledge of the damage and pain Kratom causes. 

But take heart, fellow quitters. Remember that quitting is a very personal experience. Some people use a lot for a long time and just walk away. Some of us (like me) really go through it. But man, have I learned a lot. My heart goes out to each and every one of you. Knowing how the past 5 days have been, I can feel the angst and fear out there. I've got a half a dozen people in my chats asking for advice. Thank God for that. They all give me strength and hopefully I give them some too. Be strong. 

Let me tell you a little story about why they tell you about oxygen masks on planes. They tell you ""in the event of the loss of cabin pressure, oxygen masks will drop from overhead. Put yours on before you help anybody else."" 

The reason for that is because if you are incapacitated, you can't help anybody else. Take care of yourselves. Be kind to yourselves. Strive. Drive. Be better than yesterday. Every day. Push yourself just a little further every time and those small differences will add up.

I know for a fact that everyone is capable of doing this thing. Fair winds on your journeys, friends.",22

Usage fluctuated between 9-18g/day (almost always on the low end, aside from two bad flares of neck pain). I've briefly quit a few times, but always went back when pain started flaring.

I knew probably a year ago that kratom was starting to have a bad effect on my body--worsening deficiencies I already had--but I was hurting so bad that I couldn't bring myself to quit, even though I knew it was making things worse in the long run. I did a reaaaally long taper and was almost ready to jump just a few months ago, but a back flare stopped me and I went back up to my usual dosage. However, my stomach finally made the decision for me--I believe I have an ulcer (could be gastritis, but based on symptoms, I don't think so), and I believe it was brought on by kratom.

Since the beginning, kratom has always made me feel hungry within 15 minutes of taking it. So many things drop my blood sugar that it never occurred to me that it could be stomach irritation. But after my severe stomach pain leveled off, the feeling turned into something that mimicked hunger, and it suddenly hit me...holy shit, it's been irritating my stomach this entire time. So I switched to tea, which didn't eliminate the problem but did help a lot, and did a slow taper. Finished four days ago with no issues! 

Fuck this shit, man. I've known it was poison for a long time, but chronic pain is a monster. Hopefully I can now begin to correct some of my deficiencies and start to feel better again.",9

Was in the 35-40 gpd range for quite awhile. Lowest i was ever able to taper was 17g. 

Found NAD+ IV therapy 3 weeks ago and it has helped me taper down  to 5.6g today ((4)1.4g doses)

This is the week I jump!

Seriously wondered if I would ever get here! 

Even though I’m about to be “free”, I’ve been a functional addict on various different substances for 10 years now including Kratom (2018-present), oxycodone (3 months in 2016), Modafinil (on and off for the past 2-3 years), Tramadol (2010-2011) Xanax (2013-quit about 3 months ago). Oddly enough alcohol and weed are not things I’ve ever had much interest in (thank God!)

I clearly have a desire to medicate for a variety of reasons, some of which I’m conscious of (some anxiety, some social anxiety, wanting to “get an edge”) and some of which I’m not conscious of.  I know this: It’s likely a matter of time that i find something else or jump back in to something unless i figure this shit out and deal with it.

TWO questions:

1. I have an opportunity to go into a high-end addiction recovery facility for 6 weeks. Should i do this OR should I just do outpatient? 

2. What supplements should I start taking immediately to help ward off the inevitable psychological issues I’m going to be dealing with post-Kratom?

History: I have been on Kratom for over 5 years . At my peak I was taking 5 liquid extract shots per day which I believe equates to 70GPD. A year ago I cut back to 4 shots and a month ago I cut my daily usage in half by taking half of a shot, x4 per day. I had zero negative effects which was surprising. 

I have started tapering even more to 1/4 of a shot or x2 shots per day with zero negative effect. I have tried going without but only make it about 6-8 hours before the crap hits the fan. 

I would like to try mega dosing Vitamin C. I take 60mg of Vyvanse per day for ADHD which for me is absolute hell without the medication. I am very disciplined with Vyvanse and even take “holidays” for a few days every month to keep it in check. One thing I notice is that when I’m not taking Vyvanse, my W/D symptoms if I go awhile between doses are much more apparent. With Vyvanse, I don’t feel it nearly as much. 

As someone who’s taken it for awhile now, I am concerned how Mega Dosing VitC will affect my Vyvanse medication. I have read that it can significantly impact its efficacy. I am not at all against stopping the Vyvanse entirely during the W/D process but am hoping to avoid that. Maybe I’m being overly optimistic but figured it’s worth a shot to ask. Thank you in advance.",2

I’m late 40’s in age and quit CT in 2017 after a year and a half daily habit of between 10-20gpd plain leaf. I Experimented with Kratom off and on since 2007. I never experienced withdrawals until that last lengthy stint. Quitting was one of the worst and best things I ever dealt with. Accutes and PAWS was seriously messed up and lasted a long time for me. But, the experience led me to never taking that stuff again and committing to quitting other things (alcohol and cannabis). I’ve been 100% sober for almost 3 years.

This place was really helpful during my Kratom quit and I thank everybody who shared (and continue to share) their experiences here. If it wasn’t for this sub I would have been completely alone during my struggle and may not have made it. I was dealing with the breakup of my marriage at the time and didn't have personal friends in my life to talk to. I'm also not a religious man who had a god/church to lean on. It was myself and this place. So, I just wanted to give thanks to this wonderful community. And if anybody has any questions about my Kratom experience, sober life, etc...feel free to ask. This account is relatively new, so my past post history is not available.

I wish you all the very best and remember...what you’re experiencing now will eventually go away. Just got to dig in and do the work. It's so worth it. Keep on keeping on!",105

How did you manage this? Any comments are greatly appreciated.","Heads Up: I know this is long so bear with me, no TLDR will be provided (too difficult to explain so shortly). 

Good morning everyone, 

I have tried quitting kratom so many times ive lost count. In my opinion the absolute worst part of withdrawals is this restless feeling at night, your brain seems to just say ""no dude, not tonight"" even though you are dozing off, you still cant sleep. 

Something that a portion of people get when going through withdrawals is this jerking/twitching restlessness and the most frustrating part about it, these always occur the minute you decide you want to get to bed and get some much-needed rest for your recovery.

So here are some of my questions, and trust me, I have tried my best to find these answers on this sub as well as elsewhere before resorting to making this post (Ill try to be as quick and concise as possible):

First Question:

As soon as I want to sleep, I get this feeling in my chest. When I feel this sensation in my chest, I know that the jerking is on its way and I may not get any sleep at all, 30 minutes to 90 minutes if Im lucky. However, unlike hypnic and myoclonic jerks, these jerks feel voluntary to me. So heres what happens, I lay down, get this sensation in my chest (like an anxious feeling), and to relieve this feeling in my chest I begin to jerk and the sensation is relieved, but only for a minute at most. Can anyone relate to this? If so itd bring me comfort just to know im not alone.

Second Question:

If you have had this type of feeling while trying to get some rest, what did you do to help remedy this feeling? Did you even have success trying to remedy this, or did you simply slug it out? 

Third Question:

How good does it feel to be kicking your demons ass and having this great support network online? 

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and thank you ahead of time if you commented. You guys really are awesome and I think its beautiful what you guys have created here, take care, and best of luck to all of you.

I can’t believe I’m even at this place in my life & im sure you are all too in the same boat as me. Anyway I’ve been using kratom (tablespoon) a day for about 4 years. It was good for a really long time because it helped with my self confidence & my concentration for work at night. Until it wasn’t.

About two weeks ago I really hit rock bottom. A very unusual dark place for me.  I’ve never experienced anything like this. I felt very depressed & alone. Point is I got off of it. Quit cold turkey. 

I guess why I’m posting this is because when I quit two weeks ago I felt sort of fine. The depression still lingered but it got better day by day. 

Until today it’s been two weeks & I feel like I have crazy anxiety & feel just empty. Along with nausea. The sunlight makes me on edge. My emotions today just feel very out of whack. I feel like once I hit 14 days clean I started getting all the really physical & psychological withdrawals. I was just curious if anyone else experienced this. 

Does the withdrawal symptoms get worse around 2 weeks? Does it go away & come back?

My main symptom was severe chills. I was finally getting over the chills and stopped noticing them. The past few days, I’ve had a few different situations where I was drinking alcohol (I rarely drink, like a few times a year). After drinking these few times, I find myself having really bad chills again. Has anyone experienced this kind of withdrawal symptom relapse from alcohol? Is my body being reminded of kratom so it gives me a similar withdrawal response to what it felt before? I’m having a hard time understanding this.

Also if this is what is happening, should I avoid alcohol permanently or will this get better the longer I stay off kratom?",8

I want my emotion back. I can't write music or write stories anymore. My creativity is gone. It's ruling and ruining my life!

I was a heroin addict. Quit with suboxone, which ended up even harder to quit. Then I remained sober for about a year, and then was introduced to kratom. I thought, ""I found a loophole,"" as I am sure all of you thought too. 

I kept telling myself ""it's legal, it's only as addictive as coffee, and it's harmless."" But anything that puts you in a debilitating withdrawal is not ""harmless."" 

I have been dope sick, and I am sure kratom WD is not as bad, and yet I am terrified to quit. I keep looking for a magical OTC recipe, but none seem to exist. People say kava helps, while others say it makes it worse. Some say lopermide. Stem and vein. 

I have a lot of responsibility, so to be out of commission even for a day is bad. I don't know where to begin. Perhaps I should go cold turkey and ""man-up"" but no matter what I should do, I am terrified.

Thank you all.

Update: Sunday I micro dosed coming down from over 60 grams a day. I did a quarter of a teaspoon breakfast lunch and dinner (time wise--didn't eat) and got a lot of the sweating out. I used a white strain instead of my usual green malay. I had a real sleep for the first time in 2 years. But...

Today I woke up feeling like poop with a migraine. I dropped the kid off at school, grabbed coffee for my wife, and brought her to work, and came home and got busy doing my work. I was dying though. So...I hit up the doctor and got a script of gabapentin (as everyone has told me to do). It was actually quite easy to get. That and IB 800 for migraines. 

Right now I feel AMAZING and I wrote a song for the first time in 2 years. Here's my formula:

Gabapentin 100-300  (1)
St. Johns (2)
L-Theanine 100 mg (1)
5-HTP 100mg (1)
2000mg of vitamin c
800mg Ashwaganda (1)
Super B Complex (1)
Lopermide 10mg 

I feel excellent! But the sweats come and go!",17

But I need the support. I’ve been coming to this thread for a long time and I’m ready to be done with this crap. 
I took my last dose on Wednesday night. I’ve been a heavy user for 3 years now. I found it going through PAWS from opiates and being stuck in a bad marriage not knowing what I was getting myself into. I’ve tried to quit many times, but it’s been hard. I’m a single mom and have a career that requires my full mental attention. 
Thursday was ok. I was sweating and jerky with other mild withdrawal symptoms. It was that night that got bad. I couldn’t sleep, and when I did, I had the most gory horrible dreams plus rls and extreme anxiety. Around 4am I found some lope in my med cabinet and figured I’d give it try. 
I’ve been managing since then but I’ve heard much worse about getting off loperamide. Would it be best to drop it and just power through?

2021-11-27 18:46:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/r3q9vw/i_need_some_motivational_words/,I need some motivational words,"Hey guys. I have been on kratom for about a year, almost. I started in February. I have been on and off with this stuff for 12 years, after being sent a sample at 16 and not knowing what it was. The last time I quit it, I thought I would kill myself if I didn't. It was a 4 and a half year stint of using 50gpd, waking up during the night to take it to avoid withdrawal, but needing to work to live so I was honestly contemplating suicide. I said, never again. I quit, I vowed never again.

&#x200B;

Then, I had a seizure and broke my tailbone and had a spinal injury. This was around COVID, and no doctors would take a serious look at me. I lost my mind with pain and was at a point of absolutely being suicidal again because the pain was too much to bear but nobody was listening to me. In fact, they were judging me because I was so erratic at that point, I couldn't verbalise myself properly. I decided to go back onto kratom, not because I wanted to, I felt I had to.

&#x200B;

So, the pain has resided a little bit, it will never be gone as I didn't have the procedures I needed to fix my spinal problems (I have a bad doctor) and my tailbone is pretty much fractured or something forever. Woo. Anyways, I keep putting off tapering. I went through so much hell last year, I don't even know if I want to feel again. However, the withdrawal i'm experiencing in between doses isn't worth it. I keep saying, tomorrow I'll do a taper. Tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow. I am afraid i'll have to go back to work soon and end up in the same loop I used to be stuck in, needing time off work to quit it but not being able to get it. I need motivation to start this today, the taper. Please outline how much better you feel off of it, I honestly don't remember what good feels like and that's the biggest issue here. I assume life will just be pain like it was before starting kratom with all the injuries from the seizure, but I think thats skewed thinking. I need positive feeling reports about the change!",6

2021-11-27 15:00:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/r3ljse/the_lies_you_tell_yourself/,The lies you tell yourself,"Hey all, I've wanted for awhile post on this subreddit for my personal story, and take on this substance and why it's SO hard to get off of. Screw what everyone says, it is really hard to get out it the kratom use cycle. 

I started taking kratom ~ November of 2019. I noticed this weird green substance I've never seen before, and supposedly it helped with anxiety / depression / relaxing after a hard day. 
I've always been super active, and I am a VERY achieved powerlifter before 2019. I was physically getting myself to a limit that far few people achieve within their lifetimes, and I was only 17 when I was there. 

When I first took kratom, I didn't feel anything (as many people don't), then I just kept taking it as I wanted to see if I could get the benefits at some point. After a couple weeks I felt it, and when I started taking at work holy cow was I able to talk to people so much easier. My boss even acknowledged that my social skills dramatically improved. Part of the reason I took kratom is because I had two really toxic and annoying coworkers who would constantly make my life a living hell when I messed up, and this went on for many months. I just kept taking kratom, more and more. Oh, one more dose won't hurt after lunch. Oh, one more dose when I get home from work to wind down. Oh, the kratom makes me feel a bit tired so I think I'm just gonna skip working out and do it tomorrow when I have more energy. 
The thing is, the cycle repeats. I kept taking more. And more. Trying different strains. Doing it first thing on the weekend fasted so I could feel it more. I lost about 15 lbs of muscle after only four months since kratom made me lose my drive for working out (fuck, I hate that now.). 
I continued on until March this year. Met a beautiful woman. Took multiple 4 hour bus trips to see her. For some reason because I was falling in love I stopped taking kratom because for once, this other person depended on me to be strong and I knew that kratom was stopping that. 
Fast forward two months, and she's out of the picture because of personal reasons. All the sudden I'm left with a heartbreak. Weirdly enough that nudged me to get back into the gym, and hell I did some crazy shit again and was almost 160lbs from 135 I let myself get to. 

I was also three months clean at that point, so my body had long forgotten what kratom was. So I stupidly decided one day to just take like 4 capsules, and all the sudden the workouts don't seem as fun as kratom, video games, weed, and ordering takeout on the daily. It felt so good, or that's what this substance made me believe. 
I stopped working out AGAIN, and found myself in the SAME slump I was in before. I didn't do any chores. I found no pleasure in doing anything but kratom. God, that was a low I thought I'd never get to again. I started taking extracts and holy shit, an OPMS black literally made me feel so happy Everytime I took it. I took extracts multiple times a week even though my bank account was getting shit on by my bad habits. My stomach completely got fucked and the water I was drinking felt like it wasn't even being absorbed, and the food I was eating was getting blocked up in my gut. I swear to God if you took my intestines out and cut them open you'd find a green sludge inside that was sticking itself to my intestines. 

Now, it's been over 6.8 months since I started again. I feel like I fucking blinked and I was back in the hellhole I was in before. I still worked out at least a little bit so I'm still pretty fit, but I'm over this. I'm over this lie that I tell myself ""just one more day"". I'm sick of living in fucking filth and finding it acceptable as long as I dosed high enough. I wish kratom was illegal as this substance can absolutely cause horrendous things to happen to your personality. I'm not even a quarter as strong as I once was mentally,.physically, and spiritually. I used to not even take drugs back in 2018 other than the joint here and there. If I took myself back then, and showed him who I was today he'd be pretty pissed off. 

Stop now, before it's too late. I'm currently on day one of a long journey. I know that this substance isn't good for me. I'm not going to be in denial any longer. I need my strength back. I need my divinity back. I need my conscious voice to guide me back to my authentic self. I pray for everyone here that they quit, and never look back. This plant isn't worth trading for a real life with real relationships and real health, not just a fake sense of well being even though your physical reality is completely shit and fucked up beyond belief. 
I really hope I can completely forget about this substance and never look back.",39

I didn't think it was possible. 6 years as a multiple dose daily user, more quit attempts and relapses that I can count, and for the first time I truly feel free of it.

And it feels good. I just wanted to make a quick post about it here, as this community helped make it possible for me. Reading everyone else's struggles to shake the stuff, their triumphs and failures, everyone's journeys, it gave me the strength to keep trying. And I think it's finally stuck. And I'm proud of myself, which is not something I think I ever felt on Kratom.

I also wanted to give my thoughts and advice as a long term user and (so far) successful abstainer. Here they are in no particular order:

1. **Relapsing doesn't make you a failure, it just shows you need to change something else to quit successfully:** I hear a lot of talk on here about different quitting methods (CT, tapers, supplements, prescriptions, etc.). While those can be important, there are so many internal factors that I believe are much more important. For me, it was asking myself ""what am I running away from and using kratom to avoid dealing with?"". For me, it was a number of factors, but the biggest was truly hating my job, some difficult money problems, not coming to terms with a failed relationship, and feeling as though I had abandoned and failed many of the people I care about. Once I started addressing some of those things, kratom just no longer made sense at a certain point. I started shedding all the reasons I had to run back to it, and so when the time finally came to walk away, I didn't look back. For a long time, I very much had the mindset of ""I need to quit kratom so I can deal with my bigger issues"", but it really truly was the other way around.
2. **Therapy was more than worth it for me:** If I had one recommendation for how to get through this successfully, it would be to start seeing a therapist if you aren't already (or make a change to your current therapist if it isn't working out). I know not everyone can afford a therapist (for me, I really had to make things stretch to make it work), but see if there are any low cost or sliding scale providers in your area. Talking through everything that's going on, and coming to terms with why you're choosing the drug over sobriety are so so helpful.
3. **A lot of those weird side effects did get better with time (but it did take time):** One of the big things that pushed me to quit was that I started to have these weird episodes where I would all of a sudden get light headed, my heart would start racing, and I felt like I was having a panic attack. It didn't start happening until a few years in, weirdly, but near the end of my use it was happening with more and more frequency. Now that I'm 200 days out, it doesn't happen at all. Such a relief. I have also stopped shedding hair at an alarming rate (which was happening on kratom). Now, has all of my hair that I lost grown back? Not yet, but it does definitely look fuller to me. Also, my libido has definitely bounced back, and sex is much better/easier without kratom in my system. I can get boners, don't lose them as often, and can have an orgasm without monumental effort. Win win. So if you're experiencing these symptoms, there's a good chance they will improve after quitting. Just know that most of them took a few months to really improve (for example, I think my libido was still terrible until like 3-4 months post-quit)
4. **Tapering worked best for me:** Like I said before, I think that the method of quitting is less important than what you change in between attempts, but for me a very gradual taper was what I used the time I finally shook it off. I was at about 20-25gpd (2-3 doses per day of about 8-10grams) when I decided to quit, and slowly started shaving off a grams or so at a time, to the point where I was only taking enough to trick my body into feeling something (like a gram or two at a time). I stayed at that tiny dose for like a week or two, then I jumped. I didn't feel too many intense withdrawal symptoms at that point, really just the insomnia, fatigue during the day, and some irritability. I didn't use any supplements other than black seed oil, but that did definitely seem to help with my withdrawal symptoms and cravings. That and exercise. Running, jogging, even walking. Get up, move around, drink some water. Journal. Work through your thoughts and cravings. Keep going
5. **Feeling euphoric is not the same as feeling good:** This is just something I realized on the way that helped guide me toward quitting. After being off the stuff for a few weeks, I started to feel good about things, but not euphoric (the way kratom made me feel). Sitting on the couch after my nightly dose, playing video games, eating whatever, with a stupid high smile on my face. Yeah, that light, smiley, ""high"" feeling... it's hard to beat (even talking about it is triggering a bit of craving). But after I quit, it slowly got replaced with something better. Now, I feel good. Not euphoric, but good. Being able to make time and commitment to see my baby nephew and watch him grow. That feels good, but not euphoric. Having conversations with friends where I can think clearly, listen, and respond thoughtfully feels good, but not euphoric. Taking control of my life through hard work and discipline feels good, but not euphoric. That specific kind of instant, on-demand euphoria was hard to give up for me, so hard. But losing it gave me the ability to feel real, lasting joy from watching things that I nurture grow and change. And right now, I don't think I ever want to let that feeling go.

I guess I had more thoughts than I realized. I hope some of that mess is helpful to someone. I just really want everyone who's struggling to know that it is possible to live beyond the fog and sludge that kratom has you trapped in. It does get better.

Just helped a friend get off this. Since I leaned on this forum I had to drop a line to offer hope. Apparently 3 yrs maybe on/off started small then 10-20 gpd about a year. Usually only started after 4pm. Started thinking it was just a supplement, why is it not regulated?

Timeline:

Day 1-3 CT: minimal sleep, RLS, anxious, still functioning(ish)

Day 4-5 CT: things got real. No sleep, maybe lightest sleep ever 30 mins - 1 hour. Wanted to give up. Took one capsule (wouldn’t recommend), no relief.  Wanting to crawl out of skin. Fatigue, pain, RLS, mentally taxed

Day 6 CT: Worst day yet, almost gave up. Only walking to showers/bath to pass an hour. Breaking point at 7p, crying  / asking about detox. Almost breaking point. Finally forced a walk outside and CBD for sleep. Slept 2 hours.

Day 7 CT: FINALLY! Life tolerable, forcing walks. Started feeling hope. 

Day 8-10 CT: Slowly better everyday!! Force walks, get out of head, follow suggestions on this thread. Journal may help see progress. Sleep improving to 4-5 hours / day.

Day 11 CT: Able to be with family on thanksgiving!! Still felt lousy but so much progress! 

Day 12 CT: 6 hours sleep last night. Dreaming when woke up to pee, must be deeper sleep. Feels like joining the world again.

There is hope, like so many here say - just keep pushing, don’t look back, remember the pain is a path to a new life. Use tools: force walking, music, yoga, showers, talk to a loved one, have a support person, get honest, no matter what just keep pushing. Seems like it gets better right at worst moment.

Join a recovery group! Realize everything is raw, anything covering up with use may come back hard at first, pain is progress, don’t forget how far you’ve come.

There’s hope all. There is hope! I’ll be spreading the word about this experience with a “harmless plant”. 

Thank you to everyone here, forum is a God send.

You got this. Let’s go.",13

After a few hundred days of being clean i started to feel kinda like quitting kratom didn’t solve my problems and becomes depressed. I have been dabbling here and there maybe once a week use of kratom. I don’t get any physical withdrawals but mentally I feel like I am messing with myself. It makes me kinda sad and I get down in myself for using it sparingly. I had a dose today bc of my depression and I want to stop completely again.

Fast tapered in 2019 and relapsed after 3 months. Then used 8-12 gpd for 10 months and fast tapered just in time for Christmas 2020.

With some chaos (stress, pain, and a move) I somehow ended up trying the small potent bottles at the smoke shop. I’ve been using for 5 weeks. 2 doses a day and only 2/3 of the bottle total.

I am spontaneously deciding to quit it CT because if I wean, it’s going to take me into Christmas and also risking using into the new year. I know this won’t be fun as I already don’t feel well but I hope given that it was relatively short lived and less than a bottle a day, I can fight this off immediately.

CT or taper?,"I first began taking kratom earlier this year and took around 10-15 grams per day for around 2 months before i got off of it for 2 months. I then had a lot of stress going on and fell back into taking it because it's so available. 

I'd been taking 6-10 grams daily of mostly white kratom powder, sometimes using capsules.

For around the past week, I have been taking less and even have taken small doses of naltrexone to try and force myself off of it (i dont recommend doing this unless you want to feel like you're dying). 

The last weekish I've taken between 4-6 grams each day with a few days being the days i also took naltrexone. 

Am I better off going CT and getting through it? I haven't been on it long or on very high of a dose so I feel like I'm just prolonging my suffering right now. 

The main reason i havent gone ct already is that work was hell the one day I tried going ct so ive been taking small doses when I work. 

Any suggestions/personal experiences? I can't call off of work for a few days, im a server and it's the start of season here. 

I take prescribed valium for anxiety which does help, but i have a nicotine and caffeine habit that obviously do not help. I'm a bit afraid of taking supplements like 5-htp or ashwagandha because i have heard they can have rebound anxiety when you stop taking them.",5

Focus on the positive aspects that you've noticed since you quit. What positive changes have you noticed in your life since quitting? Once you make your mind up that you certainly want to quit forever and are not interested in relapsing, you will automatically feel 100% better. Only when you give into the negative thoughts is when you are most susceptible to failing. 

When you don't give in to temptation, you are gaining what you have always chased by taking Kratom in the first place, piece of mind. ✌️💚",45

The train of thought that says; Maybe I can take \*some\* today and continue quitting tomorrow.  
But very aware of that and NOT doing it. When I would take a couple of break days, these days would be so much harder than totally quitting. It has to be all the way.   


I don't think I really believed it would be feeling better so soon already. I am not doing great or maybe even good. But much better than the start of this week. Already starting to feel my life may be manageable without any of these substances. Which is an amazing feeling.

I live across the street from a smoke shop and they know me extremely well and give me discounts left and right.  That def doesn't make it fucking easy! Also,  Pretty much most of my twenties I took Vicodin on and off for years. And drank. Pretty sure my liver is fucked.

Anyways, I got a DUI 5 years ago and was put on probation, started taking Kratom because I couldn't do anything else. Quit when I got off probation, honestly didn't really notice withdrawals because I was so excited to get back to normal life.

Started again randomly about 6 months later. took it on a shitty day at the gym when I threw my back out pretty bad, and have basically been back at it since.

I'm on day 3 and I've only take 2-3 regular caps a day for gastro intestinal stuff. Which in my opinion is the worst, constantly feeling like you have to take a shit even when I don't have to is pretty fun. Luckily I was able to have a doctor prescribe my hydroxyzine which I took one yesterday and one the day before to deal with anxiety. Didn't not take that today. It helps, feels like a weak Xanax. I work be taking it unless absolutely necessary for anxiety/sleep.

First day was awful, could barely take the dog for a walk or get off the couch. Took two melatonin to get some sleep and just rolled around uncomfortably all night. Yesterday was slightly better but still pretty bad. I felt like I was at 20% capacity. And my back is fucking going nuts. I think the hardest part going forward is pain management without the Kratom, and figuring out what to do with my back. 

But today (day 3) I feel MUCH BETTER. I know I have a long road ahead but just getting to this point feels huge for me. And honestly kicking this compared to kicking Vicodin is much easier, but the hardest part for me is not coming back, and living without the crutch of opiates. And to anyone reading this, KRATOM IS THE SAME FUCKING GARBAGE. It's not the wonder drug you think it is at first. I wouldn't recommend it to literally anyone, Even my friends that have no addictive qualities. This shit hooks you fast and fucks with your brain chemistry.  I'm really grateful for this community, it gave me the push to get here and I'm willing to talk to anyone on here if they'd like to. I'll be needing your help moving forward too! Love you guys! Keep moving forward!  Also, my advice to anyone is take some time off work, luckily I'm working from home right now.  I use to work at a busy restaurant and I'd be struggling really hard right now if I was working through this. If you can, tough it out over a 3 day weekend and keep going.",14

I'm tired, withdrawing and haven't even made it a few weeks yet. I don't want to use, but the mood swings and cravings are real. The extra pressure to ""enjoy the holidays"" kinda sucks. Not sure if anyone else is feeling this way.

I'm just glad that the day is moving forward and tomorrow I have as much rest and relax as I want. Sleep for 3 hrs cooking since 8am. And no drink or anything else. Just watching everyone around me having fun. Meh, I'm being dramatic of course, and appreciate a place to vent. Tomorrow will be a better day and today I'm going to stay sober. Maybe a little THC, although it's probably a bad idea.

I hope everyone is pushing forward, it sucks and the rollercoaster is not at all enjoyable, but we can do this. Holiday or no holiday, sobriety is the key to a happy life. One day at a time.

Just wanted to wish everyone here a very Happy Thanksgiving (if you celebrate it).  If you’re going through it today in terms of Kratom withdrawal, I’m right there with you.  Day 26 CT :)  If there is one thing I have found, it’s that the only thing better for me than lots of healthy supplements and exercise to lessen the symptoms is getting up and putting myself in a social situation tends to take my mind off the pain.  So to everyone out there wondering how you’re going to get through today, please try to focus on your loved ones and rebuilding the relationships that Kratom damaged.  

I truly love all of you and I couldn’t do this without your support.  This is the best support community I have been a part of in terms of brutal honesty, vulnerability, and humility.  I find that reading your stories and relating to you actually gives me a bit of the dopamine that my brain is struggling to pump out.  Whether we were born this way or made ourselves this way, we’re not bad people and this community evidences that on a daily basis.

Have a great day everyone :)",54

2021-11-25 05:25:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/r1tmu5/spending_thanksgiving_sober_this_year/,Spending Thanksgiving sober this year.,"Good morning everybody and happy Thanksgiving. If you're still soner and you're not drinking sludge right now then you have a lot to be thankful for! I'm currently on about the one month mark and feeling much better. Obviously there's still a desire to take Kratom because frankly the days are boring without it but I'm still sober nonetheless. This will be the first Thanksgiving I have been sober and 2 years. Interestingly enough, the first time I ever took Kratom was Thanksgiving 2019. My cousin gave it to me. He conveniently stopped taking it about a month later because he didn't like the way it tasted but I was off to the races with it.

On a side note I have been experiencing for a long time now a feeling of my hands and legs and feet extremely hot when I'm trying to sleep. Like the skin on the outside is pretty cool to the touch but just beneath the skin it's burning up. Has anybody else noticed this? What is causing this? It's extremely annoying.

Anyway you guys get a bunch of turkey and pumpkin pie today. Cheers! ✌️",21

Around 5 days ago I decided I have to stop taking kratom. I was doing around 50 grams of it a day. I started around 15 months ago. I've tried a few times and failed but this time I am going to face the pain and push through it. My first day I started cold sweating aches all over my body and restless legs to the point I couldn't sit still. I started taking kratom to help with my shoulder pain I've had 3 shoulder surgeries. It was pretty horrible. You all know how it is. But I went to the doctor and got 800 mg gabapentin and was told to take half whenever I started getting symptoms and I have felt normal.

                                         Update
So I stopped taking the gabapentin, I only took them for four days to stop the major withdrawals at the beginning and it seems to have worked for me. I was only prescribed 10 of them. I still had 3 left. I feel great except for a lack of energy but I can push through that and it will return in time. A few people were saying it's worse than kratom itself, just dont overdo it if you go this route it's not meant to be your new drug just something to ease to restless leg syndrome if that is what is bothering you the most. For me I cant stand laying awake at night and running around the house because the pain in my legs is unbearable. I'm 100 percent sure I beat it this time. I'll post an update again in about a week",8

Wish I could just sleep through it all haha but not using anything to mask withdrawals (except caffiene and nicotine...gross i know).  Nicotine is next.  But not gonna stress it until im free from kratom 2 weeks.  

Now that I got complaining out of the way.  Its really not that bad of a quit.  Just horrible anxiety that immobalizes me...at least tries to.  Got a run in, cold showers, and wim hoff (just did a 45 minute session!).  Surprisingly my stomach/bowles are chill.  Fatigue isn't too harsh.  Cravings come and go but nothing i can't handle.

Since I can’t sleep I’m going to write up my battle with these two villains during my withdrawals. Feel free to comment thoughts or suggestions. 

I CT off 60-80gpd and am going into day 6. Through the worst now however the rls and insomnia is actually bothering me worse these last two nights. Quite hellish as you all know. Here are my attempts to fight these along with their percieced efficacy. You might get a laugh out of some of them because they’re stupid but you can relate. 

Long hot shower- by far the best method so far. Provides about 40minutes to an hour of relief. Sometimes can be the catalyst to falling asleep but not tonight. Also annoying to do multiple times at late hours. 

Hylands restless legs- maybe helps maybe doesn’t. If anything gives a little psychological boost like maybe it will work. 

Calm restless legs daily formula- take two pills between evening meal and bedtime. Unsure of whether this is helping. First time trying it and thought it was helping but not the last two nights. The bottle says it should work within a few weeks lol. 

Black seed oil- usually helps ease all symptoms during acutes. Unsure of whether it was helping at all this time in general. Might provide a psychological boost when taken. 

Masturbation- I’d rather avoid this but I’ll do anything to get relief. Provides about 20 minutes of relief consistently. Not enough to get me asleep tonight. 

Stretching- I thought I found the holy grail when stretching my legs and my glutes the third and fourth night seemed to provide massive relief. Sadly it’s not helping as much now. Provides maybe 1-5 minutes of relief. 

Body massage- helps marginally as something to do other than tossing and turning. Tension seems to come back pretty fast though. 

Slapping myself as hard as possible- This is generally out of frustration and desperation and I don’t recommend people start hurting themselves, however in dire circumstances the pain can be a nice vacation from the rls. 

Magnesium Powder (Calm)- I think this does help a little in general taken near or at bedtime. 

Valerian- Seems to maybe help fall asleep. Not working last two nights. 

Weed (indica or hybrid)- best to avoid if you have a problem with it, but I don’t due to it generally giving me anxiety. I had some lying around so I’m giving it a go. Taking a small baby hit maybe every 10 minutes or so. Seems to help take the edge off. Not sure how it would work if you just went full bong rip mode. Potential to be dangerous with anxiety. 

Eating something- I struggle with appetite during acutes, and my appetite is not fully back yet although I ate more today then the last 5 days combined so thats a good sign overall. I think having a decent meal so you aren’t trying to sleep on an empty stomach is a good move even if you have to force it a bit. Even just a small meal is good. Having an ice cream bar intermittently is nice when tossing and turning as a temporary comfort. 

Moving legs like a bicycle or doing muscle clenching exercises- kind of helps a little when really suffering. 1-5 minutes relief. Doesn’t provide any long lasting relief. 

peeing- peeing sometimes has a noticeable beneficial effect. I think the urinary system might be excreting harmfull metabolites still from kratom, or it’s just tied in somehow to the pathways. Same thing with masturbation for the pathways part. Those things were fucked up while on kratom, so it makes sense that they have a connecting to the healing process. Sometimes I get 5-10 minutes of relief after peeing. 

Getting up and walking around for a few minutes- 1-5 minutes of relief. 

Exercise/run during the day- I think this is a good move in general. I wen’t for my first run earlier after work and it felt great. Nothing conclusive on sleep. Probably beneficial. Not working right now. 

Wim Hof Breathing- helpful as something to do. Helpful with other withdrawal symptoms during acutes. Kind of seems to intensify the rls during the breath holds for me right now. Don’t know if I’d recommend for sleep. 

Deeper breathing/box breathing- Sometimes through the pain of rls I realize I’m not breathing properly. Slowing down and taking deep breaths seems to help reduce the rls. Nice and easy. Try to let the lungs fill like a balloon. Box breathing - 4 second inhale, 4 second hold, 4 second exhale, 4 second hold, repeat. Helpful and good exercise to focus the mind on. 

Watching tv- I’ve been trying to practice really good sleep hygeine this time, so I’ve been avoiding tv before bed like I usually enjoy. If you give up on sleep and don’t want to fight, go for it. Put on a show and let it occupy your attention. 

I think that’s mostly everything. If you guys have any better ideas to try I’d love to hear them. I expect the rls to go away within then next week or so. Sometimes it can come back towards a month out randomly which sucks. After this phase goes away I find that I start to sleep well again.",5

I got clean cold turkey in prison, then with 12 steps and counseling after. I was clean from everything for about 4 years but the last year and a half or so I have been taking Kratom daily. Currently up to about 25 grams per day 😔. I've tried to quit cold turkey before but the anxiety and fatigue were so difficult. I set some time aside to detox over the next 7 days starting today (Thanksgiving) I even found an online doctor who wrote me a script of comfort meds 

Gabapentin 300 mg 3x/day 
Clonidine. 1 mg 4x/day 

And if needed I can get lucemyra... 

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to best use these comfort meds especially the Gabapentin? Should I wait a day or two to start the Gabapentin when the withdrawls hit full steam? And how long can I take it before i get dependent on it? Should I taper down toward the end? 

And how long can I expect these withdrawls to last?",7

2021-11-24 17:49:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/r1hf4p/day_0/,Day 0,"Greetings everyone.

It’s been a while since my last “Day 0” post.

I’m taking another crack at this tomorrow and I have a very, very good feeling about it.

As it stands now, I usually “quit” every Friday night, have 2 days of WD over the weekend and then relapse on Monday. This has been the case for years now.

I didn’t even try and quit last weekend because I didn’t feel like going through the WDs.

I’ll be with family/etc all throughout this week and won’t have the opportunity to get more.

This puts me at 4 full days until I have to stare kratom in the face and say “no”. It won’t put me completely out of acutes but I’ll definitely be in a better spot physically on Monday.

I plan on exercising, journaling, wim hof breathing, meditating, praying, drinking plenty of water, moderate cannibas use, not drinking and seeking/providing support on this sub.

I went to one of the bi weekly online support meetings (which I highly recommend)fairly recently and someone mentioned that “When it’s your time you’ll know”

It’s my time now….I can feel it. I’m ready to shed this shell of a person I’ve become and start being the real me.

I’m tired of talking/thinking about my desire to quit and to start talking about how my life has changed since I’ve quit.

I know what I’m in for in terms of WDs tomorrow. As a matter of fact, they will probably be a little worse than normal since my usage has upticked and I didn’t do my standard two day break last week.

I also know that PAWs will come after next week.

This is fine….I’ve got to give the piper his dues…..and I owe him a lot. This being said I’m not going to pay him a penny more than I need to. (In other words, I’m going to let the physical pain be my punishment….I’m not going to punish myself by wallowing in shame)

I want to deeply thank everyone in this community again for the support that you provide. There are some truly remarkable people here!",7

Each lasting about 3 months, and each time separated by like 2 years. This time around my dosage has gotten way out of control and I’m spending too much money. Also I’m just sick to my stomach on it and especially when coming down. When I don’t take it I don’t experience much sickness so hopefully that’s a good sign. The fun is gone now. I’ve spent way more money than I wish to admit to myself on it and it’s time for me to stop. Also was using it to lose weight and motivate myself to get some goals done. I ended up gaining weight and getting nothing done. Excited to be my normal self again. Going CT tomorrow so pray for me. Thanks for this group, you all are great here.

Edit Update: First two days were fine, no difficult physical withdrawals really sometimes get hot flashes but I think that may be because I am dehydrated, once I drink water I’m good. Mentally a little anxious and bored. Not much motivation and some pain in my body but I think that’s because I wasn’t active/stretching. So basically just a result of not taking care of myself for three months. I was only on for three months but last day I was at 40GPD feeling nothing but sick. Rn I am constipated af and having a hard time passing this shite. Drinking hot water to try and get it through. If there is one reason I’ll never do this again is because of the painful shites.",11

So I decided to list some of the ways my life will improve without the kratom in it. I wanted to post it here, cuz I'm surprised by how many perks I found. Quitting really is the only sane option.","When I waver in my decision (as I know I'm going to in the next few weeks) I'm going to come back to this list: Maybe it will resonate with some of the good people lurking on this sub, debating whether it's worth taking the next step and quitting, or even just posting to look for some advice. I hope it's alright that I make such a self indulgent post here, and obv. my experience, and my reasons for quitting will be different than yours. But here we go! Some of the things I'm looking forward to are...

\- better sleep  
\- more persistence in creative endeavors and projects  
\- better able to maintain relationships w/ loved ones  
\- more passionate about my experiences of art and life  
\- more living in the moment  
\- more inspiration  
\- more freedom to choose what I do with my life  
\- less shame/ feeling as though I'm hiding my addiction from people  
\- better able to challenge myself  
\- can be a better friend and collaborator than I am now  
\- Able to grow and change into the person and artist I must be instead of staying stagnant.  
\- less monotony  
\- fewer regrets  
\- less hopelessness  
\- less isolation  
\- more able to face my struggles and emotions head-on instead of running from them  
\- better able to be honest with myself  
\- more thoughtful, more receptive to the inner voice  
\- more curious- more patient  
\- less trapped in other, seemingly never-ending, cycles of compulsive behavior  
\- more in control of my life  
\- Less suppressed appetite  
\- less nausea/ constipation  
\- Fewer eye issues, less acne  
\- More saved money that can be invested for my future.

That's all I can think of at the moment. I really recommend writing out something like this for yourself too if you're debating your next step... Somehow I was able to rationalize so many problems kratom was bringing to my life, but seeing all of these things together is really powerful. As I'm writing this, it occurs to me that part of the difficulty with this drug is that it's very possible for many of us to use it while still functioning at more than just a bare minimum level. So many of us can go to work, and can afford our rent, maintain proper hygiene, etc., and it might be that most people around us have no idea that anything is the matter. In other words, we might never hit a rock bottom with kratom the same way we might with other drugs. So maybe it's a mistake to be always waiting for the perfect moment to quit, since that may never come. Instead, maybe it would more helpful to frame it as, how will your life change for the better when you walk away from this stuff? When the withdrawals and PAWS are past, and it's finally loosened its grip on you? Thanks for reading.

Wish me luck!",10
2021-11-23 23:13:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/r0w3yq/3_weeks_takeaway/,3 weeks takeaway,"I just reached 3 weeks yesterday!

My most recent takeaway after a weekend of socializing is when I was taking kratom, I truly believed I needed to take it before social events to enjoy myself. I don’t drink or use any other substances, so I always thought the kratom helped me feel more comfortable and socialize. However, I realize that was a lie. Whenever I’d take it and see people, as soon as it wore off I’d wanna go home. It hindered my plans, and got in the way of my connections. 

But this weekend, I was so present and I had a lot of fun. I was funnier and more aware of my emotions. And it felt so good to know that my excitement and interest was genuine. It wasn’t fueled by a substance. 

There’s still a lot of boredom and anhedonia but I know that’ll fade. 

Cheers to anyone on this path. I’ll keep going, and I hope you’ll do the same. :)",15

This is for the people that's planning on tapering or quitting CT. This is also for people thinking about trying kratom or in their early stages of taking it. Hear me out, I'm not a doctor or neurologist (Hell most of them don't even know anything about kratom). So I can't tell you how your experience will be, or how it will react with your body. I just know myself and how my body reacts to things.

#**My Story**  

I was on a 150 gpd habit on a particularly potent powder i cant say in here since the mod wouldnt approve the other versions of this post.(Other strains stop working. Glad I didn't start taking the liquids. $20 a bottle is expensive) My tolerance was so high that I would take my regular 125 -150 gpd dose and still get withdrawals a couple hours later. Kratom ruined a couple years of my life. I had a great job making decent money, and bought my dream car I always wanted as a kid at age 20 (392 SRT Challenger), found a nice place to live etc. I was always independent, made my own money and took care of myself and my health. I was doing good for myself and my wife at a young age. (Yes I got married young). I found kratom like 2 years later just browsing on reddit and reading how great kratom is, and how you don't get addicted to it and it's safe to take. It started out wonderful, I felt like a new person, life seemed more enjoyable, simple things were fun. I loved it because it made me feel great without side effects. I stopped drinking alcohol and smoking bowls, I didn't even plan to stop doing other stuff I just stopped (I wasn't an alcoholic, but I drinked frequently but hated how I felt after drinking. Also never had alcohol withdrawals before) and like everyone else my dose was low, I was taking like 3 scoops daily at the max for a couple months, but then slowly but surely it kept increasing because of tolerance. 

Eventually after taking only kratom for 1.5-2yrs things started to go downhill. Kratom stopped working, the only dose that worked was the morning dose but after that wore off i felt terrible again, anything after that just made me feel worse. I started to become complacent, lazy, not getting stuff done, I stopped working out, stopped doing stuff I enjoyed like going out with friends, being creative, making business plans, making music and playing video games. I even quit my job because I started to get easily overwhelmed and couldn't handle stress or perform like I used to. I could handle stress like a champ in the past. I lost my car, got evicted out of the place i was living, so thats $3000 i have to pay back in collections. Marriage was going downhill, I was just a total wreck of a person. I had to force myself to leave the house to hang with friends or family. I couldn't function normally without kratom in my day to day life. I brought it with me everywhere. Family and friends didn't know I took it, only my wife, so I would sneak in the bathroom to take more without people knowing. I moved to another state and went back to school to start over. Before kratom I was very ambitious, I wanted to own my own business by now. After I got used to being lazy, that's when the health side effects started coming in bad. I was depressed daily, got panic attacks nearly everyday, even when I took a lot of kratom, and I had to get on depression and anxiety meds. My body started breaking down, My muscles stopped working properly, I had muscle cramps and spasms daily. I dislocated my shoulder for no reason, and it still hasn't healed till this day, it still pops out even when I do simple things. Probably going to have to get surgery. (Before I was on kratom I was a healthy person, never got sick, never had any health issues, and worked out consistently. Even when I would take a couple month break from working out I would still be almost at the same strength I left off at, but not on kratom, my muscle stopped working right). I would feel sick, sweating for no reason, and had constant headaches that nothing would help, not even tylenol or caffeine. Brain fog was at an all time high, I couldn't even do college homework or attend class anymore. It was like I was going through withdrawals dailey, even though I took my regular amount of kratom which was crazy to me. What made it worse was knowing the type of person I was before.

I always held myself to a high standard, grinding everyday to be better at anything i'm tryna accomplish, and achieve my goals, but kratom took that drive out of me and it made me feel hopeless, like will I ever be able to recover from this, or will I ever be my old self again. Addiction ruins families and relationships. My wife was getting fed up with my addiction problem and it put a lot of stress on her and ultimately damaged our marriage. Trying to scrape up any money I can find to get my next kratom dose even if it hurts us financially. I know I can recover and gain back things I've lost, but it kills me inside thinking about where I would be in life if I hadn't touched kratom. I screwed up my life so I had to quit somehow. I tried for several months to quit but failed. My breaking point was one day, I was physically and mentally feeling so bad I was planning to kill myself to end the pain. That's when I knew it was time to get help immediately. 

So I had my family take me to a detox center, called out of work for 7 days, and muscled through the withdrawals. They didn't even give me anything to help with the withdrawals.(Even though when I called and asked they said they would give Clonidine to help. I was so pissed off at the time) They didn't even give me anything to help with sleep, so I was up for days. The withdrawals were bad. No sleep, RLS all day, sweating and cold at the same time, shitting anything I ate, delirious, brain zaps, releasing fluids from every hole in my body, I was basically a zombie for 3.5 days. The bright side was that it wasn't that different from the feelings I had while on kratom, just more a sickly my body is fighting something type feeling. I'm glad they didn't give me any subs while I was there even tho I did want something for relief, but I'm glad cause I don't need anything new to get addicted too. Day 5 is when it started to get better, I still was out of it mentally and my body felt like it just got out of a battle, even though I was sitting or laying down the entire time. Day 7 once I got out was even better, still had RLS at night but no physical withdrawals. Day 10 I was able to get like 4hr of sleep, but no RLS  (At day 7 I started taking supplements to help with RLS). I definitely feel better now, I'm still struggling with tiredness, motivation, sleep, anxiety and doing simple things. I hear it gets better after your brain heals, but I'm just taking it one day at a time. 

Just like me, people are just scared to just quit, and it's holding them back. I wish I did it sooner. Kratom WD won't kill you so you'll be fine. Withdrawals will be over quicker if you CT. Tapering just makes the withdrawals last longer. It's difficult to develop and stick with a taper plan and it makes you anxious taking less, causing you to take a little bit more without realizing it, dragging out the process and spending more money. I see people here recommending tapering or CT, and I've tried both and CT was more effective. The withdrawals will be similar, CT will be tough but not by much and will be shorter. The thing is you will still feel the withdrawals if you taper, you will just be toying with yourself for months, being in the habit of putting the slugg in your mouth but still feeling like crap. The faster it's out of your system the better.


If you're new to kratom don't be fooled by all the people in other forums saying ""it's a miracle drug"", ""it's ok to take"", ""it's not as bad as other opiates"", and ""withdrawals aren't that bad if you want to quit at any time"". No kratom is just as bad as any other opioid, it hits the same receptors in your brain. The difference is that it's extremely difficult to overdose like other pills because kratom has a limit to how strong it can get, but the withdrawals are basically the same, and who knows what else is in it. We're just taking a risk putting stuff in our body just to feel good temporarily, then once it's over we are overloaded with the consequences of feeling so good, which is feeling like shit. I had my fair share of substances and nothing made me feel this bad or had me stuck like kratom did. Not pills, not adderall, not weed, not even drinking. (Alcohol withdrawals are a lot more dangerous if you're an alcoholic). I never felt dependent on those and I could quit at any time. If anyone is reading this you can do it, don't give up and get kratom out of your life as fast as possible so we can all recover and take our lives back. Don't let substances control you, we gotta put them in their place.

I stayed stone cold sober for the first year. I was afraid I would drink myself into Oblivion. A year ago reality set in and the depression did as well so I use kratom to treat it. I used for an entire year I quit in July that was a goddamn nightmare. I developed the worst anxiety I've ever experienced and bedridden for 5 days. So what the hell made me use again? A month after that quit I started using kratom again I used for a month and then quit again some withdrawal but nowhere near as before. Another month goes by and for whatever reason I used again but it always ends the same I can't have just one. I end up at 4 extract bottles a day or more. So here I am date for CT and this just sucks, it always fucking sucks. Here I sit with a pretty decent life I have great kids and a very good job, a bit of money in the bank yet here I sit throwing my life away. Today is the worst for me.

I used Kratom for years and finally kicked the habit about two months ago.  Wasn't easy, but I'm through it, don't really crave it, and am doing fine.  

I broke my wrist the other day and am scheduled for surgery on Wednesday.  They will prescribe Hydrocodone for pain afterwards.   I DON'T want to be in pain, but I also DON'T want to put my sobriety at risk.  I've never had an issue with pain meds, in fact, I don't enjoy the way they make me feel, so I think I'm fine to take them for several days.  Seems like a different bucket of substance to me - even though Kratom resembles an opiate.   Please let me know your thoughts.   For the record, I'm not concerned at all about taking the meds - it's more my wife, rightfully so!   Thanks!",7
2021-11-23 14:55:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/r0lona/interesting_withdrawl_story/,Interesting Withdrawl Story,"So a couple of months ago I had surgery to have my gallbladder removed. They gave me Oxy and Hydro's to take home, and of course, pumped me full of them when I was in the hospital. Around day 4 post-op, I was having serious tightness and burning in my chest, waking up in the middle of the night heart racing. Then I started getting crazy vertigo and dizziness and was having like 2 panic attacks a day. I thought I was just having trouble recovering from the surgery by the surgeon and every doctor I saw were very confused by the whole thing and it was very abnormal. It took like 6 weeks for things to cool down and get back to normal, I thought I was never going to go back to normal. 

Fast forward to today, I am at the end of a long taper and am only taking a tiny bit of stem and vein here and there when things get really bad, just so I can function. I am tapering that as well. Well guess what, all of those exact same symptoms have returned.

My guess is, the pain meds drove my Kratom tolerance through the roof, and when I stopped taking them, it sent me into instant terrible withdrawal even though I was still taking my normal amounts of Kratom at the time. This green sludge is a total nightmare life ruiner. 

So basically, if you are a long-term Kratom user, and god forbid you need surgery and pain meds, buckle up because you are in for a world of hell when you stop taking the pain meds. 

I am so close to being free from this garbage. It's hard as hell but I have to escape this miserable herb before it takes anything else from me.",7

Went to the bank, to the Gamestop in the mall, and got gas. Cold and rainy today, which wasn't helpful lol. 

Bank was fine, just used the ATM to deposit checks/cash. 

Parked at the entrance furthest from Gamestop just to get some extra walking in. Had to make a return, and grabbed a couple games that are on sale now as well. Irritability kicked up a bit when I was getting the typical upselling spiel from the person at Gamestop, but I know they're paid to do that and I remined polite. Usually I have a ton of patience and even internally I don't get irritated, so I'm not sure if that's because of WD or because I was kind of hyping up/thinking I was going to feel these ways.

I jumped onto two different ""mild"" opioids as I have rocked a 12-15gpd for 3 months now, and i had stopped before remembering the wd's as awfull.

I did one of these mild opioids for 4 days then 1 days break then the other one for 5 days and now I am here today on day 2 with nothing in the system, and i feel awful - Even worse than just quitting Kratom so big advice DONT DO THAT it will only make it worse.

This community is great.  Thanks to everyone contributing here, the good the bad and the ugly are all good for us to be reminded of I think.  
I've been lurking around here for I dunno, a while. posted a couple comments but haven't piped up.  


I put the hard opiates down maybe 4 years ago, and have been on and off dependent on Kratom since then.  And on and off convincing myself I was ""clean"" on and off those runs of K use.  

Today was day 15 of this most recent quit and... I'm feeling pretty good

things feel a little different this time.  I have some real world Why's for quitting this time, and I am actually trying to learn a real program of recovery, instead of using one I tell myself I'm smart enough to figure out on my own.  I'm fuckin not  
Used all the advice I saw on here, and all the supplements.  That all helped with the acutes but THE MOST helpful thing so far has been the WHM, breathing, cold exposure.  It is a guilt free high that truly brings you deeper into yourself.  Into your somatic experience in a peaceful way, no matter where you were before.

IF YOU ARE IN ACUTES (or PAWS) (or LIFE) AND STRUGGLING, TRY WIM HOF.  


Tonight I found a bag of capsules, probably 25g.    
I put them back, did the breathing practice, then took them to the trash bin on the curb.  And for the first of many times I've discarded drugs, I am not even remotely concerned I might go try to recover them.  

Anyway there's fucking hard moments still, but overall things are improving and I'm just really fucking grateful for that.  And I owe it in large part to you guys!  


Keep trucking",15

Then used last 2 days, with none today.  I dont know why I relapse.  Well, I do, but its such a dumb reason.  

Its always when I have school work to complete.  I just can't seem to muster up energy or focus to write papers for grad school.  I procrastinate until last minute and rely on kratom shots to fuel me through writing an entire day...nonstop.  always get really good grades too...never got under an A in the past year of grad school, and used kratom probably over half of those papers.  

Im just so sick of this cycle.  I have a recovery group (who is aware of this)  a girl friend (who knows nothing about this), and just feel like I am losing my shit.  I also know this feeling will pass in a few days, but I need to freakin stay off this shit.  It never gets to a horrible place.  I keep up with my responsibilities through the ups and downs, but I am miserable or high and isolated...no in-between.  

This is it.  This has to be it.  Gonna do whatever it takes this time to stay off for good.  I dont feel I need treatment because quitting is easy.  I may need therapy, and will look into that this week.  This sub is therapeutic.  I need to check in once a day, but I am trying to not use reddit as it becomes a crutch during quits and sometimes makes me more anxious.  

I know I'm all over the place.  I dont feel to bad as it was only a couple weeks after a month clean, but man...so tired of this.  Let me have it yall.  Good or bad, I wanna hear it all.  Or nothing.  Either way...thanks for reading.",18

I quit for about 2 months back around April/May, but since then, I have been using on and off. I say on and off because I never got back to daily use like I had previously...more like doing an extract shot a day for a few days, then going no kratom for a few days so my tolerance doesn't build too much. In some ways, I think what I have been doing is even worse than using everyday. On the days that I use I feel good for a short period, then painful regret after for succumbing again, and on days I don't use, all I can think of is using again. It's messed up. 

I'm officially marking this down as the start of day 2. I don't feel terrible yet, just not great, and like my brain is fried from the constant see-saw I'm putting myself through. One thing I did differently this time is I woke up early, took a cold shower, followed by a Wim Hoff breathing session. This will generally put me in an almost normal state for a few hours while withdrawing. I also forced myself to go to the gym during my lunch break, which I haven't done since my last real quit. I also booked a doctors appointment to get checked out, and am looking into finding a therapist that maybe I can get  help working through some of what keeps me coming back to kratom. 

Considering my sporadic use, and what I have experienced previously, I'm probably looking at a few days of somewhat manageable acutes quickly followed by anhedonia. It's time to be done with this crap for good, which is why I am posting this. Today I made a pretty simple list based on some thinking I did last night titled ""Seek that which brings life, not death"". One one column is life, the other is death. I'm sure you all can figure out which column I placed Kratom. In the life column are thinks like working out, cardio, proper nutrition, taking my vitamins, spirituality, regular doctors appointments, that sort of thing. My goal is to make my best attempt to do the things in the life column daily and avoid the death column. 

Anyways, I feel like my mind is in the right place this time to make some real progress. Look forward to posting more updates.",8

For a long, long time, I was very disciplined: only used a couple times a week, max, to keep my tolerance high and keep from getting dependent. 

This past August (right around the time I happily stumbled upon an excellent vendor with a high quality product) I said “screw it” and went daily. I kept my dosing relatively low even at my highest points of use (probably around 15 GPD), although I noticed my use was definitely slowly increasing over time. Within a month or two of daily K, I noticed it really wasn’t working as well and started noticing pronounced irritability, depression, emotional numbness, and motivation issues. A dose of Kratom might alleviate these feelings for all of 15 or 30 minutes of happiness, to be followed by a sustained cloudy feeling of being far away and numb.

Rather than continuing to notch up my dose to chase that old feeling, I read a hundred posts and a thousand comments on this sub, got freaked and started to taper, going from 10 GPD to 2.1 within a two-week time frame. I did experience mild withdrawals during the taper: increased fatigue, severe lack of motivation, depression, some middle of the night insomnia. Sometimes it was worse than mild and felt pretty uncomfortable. I had to keep reminding myself the sky wasn’t really falling. It was overall manageable, though. I did not take time off from work, for example.

My last dose was Friday night (2.1g). This weekend was relatively easy, though I had very low energy. As of this morning (Monday), some 60 hours after my last dose, I don’t have any noticeable withdrawals, although for the last three nights I’ve had to get up in the middle of the night and use decent amounts of cannabis to fall back asleep.

I did probably go overboard on supplements: BSO, NAC, buffered vitamin C, l-theanine for anxiety, traditional kava at night to help with falling sleep. And tons, tons of cannabis. Not sure if any of these ultimately helped or not, but worth sharing anyway.

I’m writing this post for lurkers who are where I was, earlier this year. If you’re young in your time with Kratom, incrementally increasing your dosage to get the same effect, stop now — it’s just not worth it. *If you’re past the initial honeymoon phase, Kratom is done for you. It will never be truly fun again.* Rather than increase, start decreasing your dosage. If you’re only a few months in with daily use, quitting is not so bad at all, nothing like the other posts on here. You don’t have to hit rock bottom to get to the end of your own use. I know I’m not out of the woods, yet, but I do know whatever is in store for me I can handle it.

I want this behind me. Now that I know the acutes are manageable I threw out my entire supply: it’s at the street currently, waiting for trash pickup. Low-use lurkers: join me!",90

2021-11-22 06:40:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/qzjkcm/my_tapering_process/,My Tapering Process,"Hi everyone,

I posted on this sub for the first time about 22 days ago. For those 3 weeks I have been tapering.

After a few years with ""moderate"" Kratom usage I arrived at daily dosing (50-60 GPD). Mostly I dosed 3 times a day for maybe 3 or 4 months. Before that I dosed any other day but roughly the same ammount. Since I want to be free of my addiction I started tapering for the second time now and I have to say I am very pleased that it was very painless for me.

I switched from leave powder to 100% Stem&Vein and only had very light withdrawal at the most. The most notable thing I experience is a loss of motivation and mild anxiety.

**Start of my taper:** I started my taper with 2 doses a day. First dose was 15 grams of S&V and second dose was 10 grams of S&V. I stuck to this regime for 10 days. 

**10 days:** After the adjustment period I dropped to 2 doses of 15 grams and 5 grams for five days, with very slight withdrawals consisting of some shivers and sneezing as wall as light anxiety and a notable lack of motivation.

**15 days :** I stopped taking 2 doses and now only took 15 grams a day. The wd-symptoms are the same. Nothing noteworthy

**18 days:** I slowly decrease my dose to 10 grams a day. No bodily discomfort whatsoever, but the lack of motivation is really annoying me. I cant motivate myself to do sports and working can be very annoying too.

**22 days:** I pushed myself to go one day without the S&V and was very much suprised that this was really not a problem at all. I was 40 hours or so without it and did not feel worse. No shovering, or sneezing, no cold hot flushes or sweating. I am soooo happy about it! :) I will now take it only every two days, while slowly decreasing my dosage. Next stop 8 grams!

**Slip ups:** Here and there I had some slip ups and took about double the dose. Shit happens! But the great thing about S&V is for me that I do not get any rush from it, but only a very very slight effect. This is great for me since the motivation of gulping down this repugnant sludge very much decreased everytime I slipped up, since it did not do much for me.

Yesterday I ordered my last Pack of S&V and I will continue my tapering. It was very easy for me not to add my favourite strains to the shopping cart, which makes me a little proud of myself. With a little luck and dedication I will quit this shit for good at the end of the year. Wish me luck :)

I would advise anybody who is trying to quit to try supplementing their kratom dose with S&V. You can shift very slowly from leave powder to Stem and Vein. It was not painfull at all for me. It totally stopped withdrawal without making me high.

We all can do it!!! :)",3

I preemptively cleared my Nov-Jan client load (yay for being a business owner) and at the end of October I started coming down. A couple months ago I tried and it didn’t work for me because I needed to be on point for work ect. I was doing about 5.5g every 3 or so hours 6-8 times a day. I read somewhere in here that 10% taper a week is preferable.

Well at the beginning of November I was already down to around 25 gpd, dosing 4.5g every 3-4 hours and only about 4 or 5 times a day!! For some reason my body was resistant and I would feel WD coming on around hour 3!! So I was going through mini WDs off and on all day and just pushing it by 15 mins, then 30, then an hour.

This past week (Tue & Weds) I took a certain prophylactic medication due to possible COVID exposure. Since my detox pathways were not flowing adequately, I think that medication really hammered my digestive system. I had gastritis, indigestion and constipation BAD and everything was not clearing out. So my doses were not being absorbed 😂 I felt everything just sitting in my gut. So I was basically forced to taper more lol. I felt like SHIT and even did an enema yesterday. That was rough.

As of the past two days, I’ve only dosed 4.2g every 5 hours and only 4 times a day!!! So I’m just under 18g now. I know it might not seem like a lot, but this is HUGE for me!

I’m thankful for the sickness for nudging me. It truly helped. Just had my last dose at 7, so I need to take my ass to bed. I know my body will wake me up at 4am. I can try to push it but maybe I will stay here and stabilize before coming down again. Or should I keep coming down? The past week has been rough and my whole body hurts. I’m afraid to eat certain foods and I feel like I’ve just run a marathon. 

I am chronically ill (I have several diseases) and while K would help with my pain, I think it’s actually causing me more harm. Kidney pain, anxiety, moodiness, insomnia, brain fog, loss of joy etc.

Any tips?? I take tablets so it’s way to easy to dose. Each tablet is .3 but each time I get a new batch, it’s weaker so we’ll see what happens with this new shipment, maybe I can drop to 3g every 5 hours. Or would it be better to stretch the time and keep the same dose for a while? I want to keep the momentum but I’m afraid. Once I’m down to about 5-10gpd maybe I can take the leap and go CT. I’m not looking forward to it but I want my life back!!!",9

My reason I started drinking kratom was bcs of I thought i smoke too much weed, so I wasn’t smoking it that much, but instead of that i started to drink K. Last couple of days i was everyday hanging out somewhere with someone smoking weed and drinking alcohol. Both of these substances are quite common in my country so that wasn’t that much suprise for me, but i felt last two days drained and sooo unhappy about everything, like, i was upset bcs on kratom i was “somehow” more sober than on alcohol or weed. I decided to take a break of going out drinking or smoking weed for next week, i wrote down a list of activities i can do by myself at home, bcs I honestly think i can’t relax, that I can’t do that sober, and i think i have to learn that.

I have a couple questions..,"I'm going into this CT, basically bought supplements and loperamide the other day to see if I could do it this time. I'm so done with this nasty substance :/. I'm 20 and have been taking kratom for 2 years... I started in December 2019 after trying my first opioid(tramadol) binge and liking it a bit too much. In the early days it wasn't much of a problem, I could go a day without taking it and I usually kept it under 5g. Four months in and tried pressed oxies for the first time... I quit kratom to go on a month or so long opioid binge. I ended up in rehab at age 18 after that whole thing, I hated it there, and quite honestly made me resent things like AA and the whole 12 step program... I relapsed on kratom a month after I got out, only reason I spent that long without it was because of an upcoming wisdom tooth surgery. I've been on it consistently since about September 2020, 30g at my heaviest usage and as of late... about 11g per day. I've wanted to quit for so long, my motivation, my mental health, my physical health all on the decline since late 2020. I tried to taper, but went back to the comfort zone every time I felt the slightest bit of emotion/anxiety. I did quit for a few other drug binges within the past 14 months, though I don't think that counts :'). I was planning to quit kratom after a heroin binge in April, though one of my closest friends passed away during that... and I lost a lot of hope. I started using flualpraz and kratom extract shots constantly. I've tapered on the flualp, but I will battle that after I'm clean from kratom, cause kratom is the larger issue for me at the moment. The cravings rn are overpowering, to put it lightly. I'm wondering if it would be a good idea at all to go buy a small extract shot tonight(36 hours), one of the Blues to be specific as they are split into multiple doses.  Take half so I can get a good sleep and then honestly idk what I'd do with the other half. After that I will be out of money for the rest of the week so I don't think wanting to buy more would be an issue. My stomach feels like it's in a knot... I don't think I'd be able to down capsules or powder atm. Should I try to stay strong or is there anything else I can do to have temporary relief? I had sleep paralysis and some minor hallucinations last night. Sorry for a whole ass biography btw lmao.",7

I initially stopped cold turkey, but then started tapering down because it was unbearable.  I’m only on 2 grams a day right now, down from 12-14ish.

My issue is, I have become EXTREMELY irritable at work but I genuinely can’t tell if it’s kratom withdrawal, or if the kratom was masking how stressed and unhappy I was at my job, and now that I’m not on kratom I’m reacting normally.

My work situation is, I work at a failing retail business that has gotten more and more dysfunctional and hectic after the pandemic and going into holiday season.  A little under a year ago, I was promoted to a position at the location where I wouldn’t have to face customers or do any sales stuff, I just did computer work/data entry at a desk.  I was pretty happy at first.  Then, our labor budget got cut, they started making HUGE changes to save money, and over time they started having me do the jobs of THREE people for less pay than the person who had my job previously.

On top of being basically an account manager, I’m expected to sell items to customers, spending hours selling high end products and giving the sales associates credit so they make commission (part time sales associates make more money than me), I’m expected to handle customer service problems that isn’t even have anything to do with my job.  People with my title at other stores DO NOT have to do all of this, I’ve talked to other people with my job title and they are shocked the stuff I’m expected to do.  I’m stretched so thin, I legitimately only spend 20 percent of my day doing my ACTUAL job, and 80 percent doing other people’s jobs.  As a result, my actual job is falling apart as I’m making tons of mistakes with accounts.  My boss and the upper management is completely aware and I don’t get into any “trouble” because they’re exploiting me to do the job of 3 people, but it’s complete chaos.  A year ago, someone got paid more than me just to focus on balancing accounts, yet I’m supposed to do that job on top of sales manage and sell products to customers.

For the past few weeks, I’ve called out of work numerous times, showed up late, left early, threatened to quit, began rallying to have my coworkers unionize, tell my boss straight up that I’m going to submit my two weeks any day now, I will legitimately walk away from customers, just stopped caring about my job.  

I legitimately can’t tell if the kratom withdrawal is making me unable to handle stress and causing me to risk my only income, or if I was using kratom to deal with the stress and now that I’m without it, that I’m reacting “normally” and should focus on completely quitting kratom and find a better job?",8

Spent the last 2 years holed up in my apartment not eating drinking beer and basically not existing. Attempted to quit CT about five months ago and ended up cracking 48 hours in. Through the CT I was able to get down to under 5 grams a day tho so it was a huge help. For people debating to go CT or taper, I could recommend this route. Basically make it 2-3 days and then take 2 grams. Basically a really rapid taper. I went through hell that first time even while on Kratom because I reduced my dose so much that I avoided actually quitting for real because it terrified me. Well I quit the 5 grams and the last week fucking sucked but I got through just fine. Wish I had done it sooner. Thankful I'm going to be able to get through the holidays without this evil demon. If anyone is hesitating quitting, please just do it. The problem with drugs is that while your under their influence they make you complacent. It's only after you come out of it that you realize how truly fucked up you were. To anyone lurking and wanting to quit, you can do it.",50

Sauna-when it’s hard to do anything, this is the easiest. Just sweat it out. You will feel refreshed, endorphins will pump.

Exercise-make it a habit to do something and build up from there. In the beginning it’s hard to even make yourself go. You will feel better immediately after. Set goals and hold yourself to it.

If you are able to taper- be honest with someone. A lot of us are ashamed and hide the problem. Open up to your significant other or friend. I have my significant other keep the stash and they gave  me my morning dose and afternoon dose. It held me accountable.

Probiotic- this stuff wrecks your GI. There are yogurts, pills, drinks. It’s very beneficial to healing.

Black seed oil- it definitely helps. It almost feels similar to taking a dose when you’re in withdrawals.

DLPA- I take this in the morning on an empty stomach with vitamin C. It helps a bit with brain fog. If I take it late in the day or too much it can cause a bit of anxiety.

Apple cider vinegar- I would take this when I was tapering, supposed to help get more out of taking less.

Beet root powder- I think I’m sensitive to vasoconstriction. When I’m in withdrawals I get really cold hands and feet. This really works for the cold feeling.

Magnesium glycinate- helps at night for relaxation and soreness.

Sam-e- I took it for my first quit and think it helped with depression

Melatonin- helps with sleep but it can definitely make the morning a bit sluggish

A few tips- understand that depression/anxiety/irritability is being brought on by Kratom and these symptoms can linger and come in waves. It’s very easy to become negatively affected by these feelings. Cope with them in positive ways and realize that it will pass and you aren’t broken. There’s a few other things that I’ve tried but these are probably the most helpful.

I'm getting back to a dose that's getting close to being time to jump rather than keep stretching things out. I've been trying to remind myself of reasons why it will be better to quit and how even keeping a small habit is going to be worse than being totally sober.

My biggest struggle is how benign the addiction seems at times, I always think ""well it's better to relapse on kratom than opiates"", while I am glad that everytime I've relapsed I didn't go back to opiates, I also wish I could get it through my head that being on kratom isn't much better fore. I've been through several attempts to quit in the past 18 months, twice when I made it completely off and through the withdrawals. First time I relapsed bc I wasn't committed to quitting and thought I'd be fine if I just ""took a break"", second time from struggling with PAWS. 

Right now my three biggest motivators to quit are

1. Medication, I finally got on medication to treat the underlying issue that drove me to kratom. I want to get it right, I know having kratom in the mix will interfere with that and everytime my kratom use increased, it made medication less effective. Decreasing kratom use has done the opposite and made it more effective.

2. Dependence, I've been using for to long to get away with casual use. Having a physical dependence (even to a small dose) is a huge burden, I know everytime I use I'm just forcing myself to have to go through WD again at a later time.

3. Mood, kratom really messes with my mood, once I get a tolerance for it, it no longer calms me and I become very irritable. It can ruin my day so easily how such small things can upset me on kratom.

Anyway, I'd love to hear your reasons for quitting, I really need all the motivation I can get to make the inevitable jump. Making this post has really helped to reinforce and remind me why I need to quit, hopefully reading it has done the same for you.",3

I would of had one year clean but I relapsed and am on day 3 now. I got a big head and then felt like I went on auto pilot. I originally started abusing RX pain meds after being severely injured, went through recovery for that as well. The about 3 years ago I hurt my back and refused RX pain medicine, a friend who didn’t know I was an addict offered me kratom for the pain and that’s how it started. Over the years it progressed very quickly and I was spending way too much money on it. I thought it’s fine because it was legal. 

Finally I went to a VA substance abuse clinic and have been having mostly success. Counting my recent relapse I’ve had two others as well. 

I look forward to reading advice from you guys and to the future mutual support. Thank you.",5

Hopelessness, body aches and depression that took on a newly dark and grieving tone. Even when I was redoing alot these symptoms would creep up quickly. 
This relapse left me seriously afraid to quit again, and I couldn't afford this.

My friend who came off of h still had some Suboxone stowed away. I got one from him. 

Despite the label saying ""do not cut or swallow"" for some reason. I did just that, cutting a little strip, maybe 1.5mm x 2mm? Swallowing it down with some water. In about 30 minutes the depression indeed lifted. I slept just fine and experienced minimal emotional symptoms, not much physical either. But physical is much more bearable to me than emotional. 

6 days later I kept up the same dose daily, I haven't even used an 8th of a sublingual dose. And the grieving depression has lifted. Time to titrate and lower my dose. 

Suboxone allowed my body to forget about the constant urge to redose, and is much more predictable and gradual with the elimination. And took next to nothing to ease the worst of the symptoms. Anybody else have any experience w this? Cheers",3

I’m a senior in high school who’s struggled with anxiety and manic depression most of my life. I’ve been on many meds and though they have worked I somehow found myself medicating with Kratom.

I heard of some of my friends using this drug recreationally and began to look into it. Once I heard that it helped with anxiety, depression, etc. I gave it a shot. I headed down to my local head shop where we buy cheap cigarillos to roll up with, and picked up a pack of red maeng da. I began to self mediate with it for anxiety on an as needed basis. I fell in love with it for the first couple weeks but quickly found that the drug that I though was curing my anxiety, was the new main cause of it. I felt trapped and scared. i found myself taking Kratom to stay away from the withdrawals that spiked my anxiety.

After 5 months of every day use, dosing multiple times a day, I knew I had to stop. I knew that tapering would never work for me. I had to go CT like I did with with nicotine and caffeine. I threw out my kratom thursday. I feel like complete shit. The hardest part is going to school and then to work at the restaurant waiting tables while withdrawing. I stay busy from 8 am to 11:30 pm with work and school. This is hell and the worst part is that I’m withdrawing in front of my friends and family who have no idea why I’m sweating all day, depressed, sick as a dog with no motivation and intense body pains.

This horrendous withdrawal has left me feeling utterly hopeless and makes me realize that i will never touch that shit again. It is NOT worth it. Kratom is a LIE. Godbless everyone who is going through it. Especially those who have taken it for years. We got this.",23

Started off ordering direct from the source a decade ago to get off opioid pharmaceuticals.  Glad I beat that and didn’t get on dope, and I’m alive.  This time it’s real and I have so much to lose, I will rather be dead than mess this up.  Third time lucky.  

I started this taper switching to a lower potency kratom, from 1.5% MIT to 1.0%. About 4 weeks ago. Despite staying at the same dosage of 40gpd this step was very difficult, let my immune system down and I was very sick for the first time since My daughter was born 5 years ago.  I gltooj 3 covid tests because I thought I had it.  It was bad, plus classic wd, but i needed that reminder of what I’ve been doing to myself.  

Once I stabilized at 40gpd/40mg mitra, I divided my typical 10g4x/day dose up to 6 smaller doses of 6 grams = 36 @ day 1.  Aiming to take 1g off daily, currently at 20g/day and have been forgetting to take my doses.  I’m ahead of schedule. 

Yeah, that’s right.  I’ve been forgetting to take kratom.  I think the mushrooms have a lot to do with that.  

I’ve taken 100mg psilocybin mushroom, 100mg lions mane, and b-complex with my first dose for the last week.  My mood is kinda good and I’m
Hopeful. I’ve had some heavy instrospective and emotional moments also.  I’m staring to see what I was becoming on kratom and I’m so happy to be done with this.  I’m on my last chance as a husband.  

I don’t suggest this or recommend it as I am an omelette cook and have no business giving that kind of advice. Just sharing for others who asked for an update. 

TL:DR. Microdosing mushrooms is helping me beat my taper.",6

My first question is, is it possible I'm still withdrawaling from the first strain? Cause I'm feeling awful on my 3rd day without it.

As a matter of fact, I decided to quit because I have battled addiction with it before & I know I'm at the point where I'm gonna go in deep if I don't stop now.

The reason why I even picked it up again was because I have been withdrawaling from antidepressants (long story, but switching doctors & don't have anyone to give me anymore, but it's been too long now) & I started using it again when family crises came up.

I'm scared because I've never felt as empty as I did right before taking it again, I live alone & can't tell my family I got addicted again. 

Another threshold I'm at, and why I'm going cold turkey tomorrow is I've spent all the money I've alloted & going any further would start to cause financial stress, and that's the last thing I need.


Back to the original question, is it possible I'm already a few days in my withdrawals?",3

Your answer to the question ""What would you do if you won the lottery?"" is to imagine holing up to detox in a luxurious resort, like a more comfortable version of the Sick Boy Method, because money has no real value to an addict.

You hear people talk about how uncomfortable they feel when they see people in old movies not wearing masks and social distancing for covid, and you can't help but laugh, because you can't remember the last time you saw a movie character making excuses about ""stomach acid"" and sneaking away to spoon green powder into squares of toilet paper.

I appreciate the positivity of this sub. I’m sure it will be an asset in the days and weeks to come.

EDIT: Made it 11.5 hours (18.5 if you include sleep time). Took about half of my usual dose when my lower back got so painful that it started making my balls ache. But, other than that and some gastro discomfort, it wasn’t nearly as nightmarish as I thought it would be. I’m pretty happy with these results, coming from a hefty spoonful every 2-3 hours. I think the fast-until-you-can’t method might be a winner.

'Hinderences are the imprints left on our midstream by unskilled actions of the body, speech, and mind. By consciously avoiding negative actions we naturally cease creating more hinderences and purify those of the past, thus clearing our mind for the attainment of realizations.'

My reward system is definitely healing. My hair is certainly much thicker, more lively, colorful, etc. My beard is gaining back noticeable thickness. You can see the life in my face and in my eyes when you look. 

Ive gained a lot of self esteem since quitting, and with this comes an increased drive to take care of oneself and to aspire and fight for better even when it would be much easier to lay down and rest in mediocrity. With the assistance of exercise and meditation, I have been peeling back that which leaves me with hinderences and replacing them with fortifying practices. 

It is not all uphill, and I'm not just magnetically drawn to continue to improve. I wake up not feeling like it often but push through it. Sometimes I let myself lapse into laziness, but I fight to get back up and keep walking. 

No matter how far along you are on the road, you're always right next to a ditch! If you've got somewhere that you want to be, like sobriety, and you're fighting to get out of a place you don't want to be, like rotting in an opioid addiction, then walk and be prepared to stumble and get back up. 
 
Anyway, just wanted to drop some of this in this sub as potential encouragement. 2 months ago I was cowering like a little boy and didn't believe I was capable of enduring what I did. I kept seeing the months pass me by wondering if I was ever going to go through what I needed to go through to get sober. Opioids take your balls from you and you've got to bite the bullet and force yourself to take the first steps to start getting them back. You ARE capable of going through this withdrawal cold turkey, even if you're feeble, depressed, and feel like any hardship is the end of the world, you ARE strong enough to endure. 

Prob won't be back in this sub to make another post until I have 100 days or 4-6 months or something. Godspeed to all people who know that they have a life to live and want to fight to live it",18

I knew I was at the end of my usage when my sleep was completely fucked, waking up every two hours sweating WHILE USING. My usage was all over the place this week, went from tapering to throwing it out the window and dosing like mad during a stressful event on Monday. 

Minimal consumption on Tuesday, sweat & slept horribly that night. Didn’t measure the dose on Wednesday, but was so tired all day & felt like shit. Yesterday, I took my last dose around 930am & also didn’t measure it. Probably around 10g both times.

Thought I was in for some shit last night, but I only woke up once & I got a solid 5 hours in without much sweat. I’m tired this morning & have a headache, but that’s it. 

Is tonight gonna be bad? I feel like I went through withdrawals all week regardless of usage. 

10-20gpd for about four months this time. My body can’t tolerate this stuff for more than a couple months at a time. Never used for more than 4 months without having to quit.",4

I'm not a stranger to this sub. I've attempted to post threads here numerous times trying to quit but I always ended up failing myself and got back on the shit.

From the last 5-6 months, I try to quit at the end of every kilo, telling myself that i'll taper off and quit. But 1-2 days into the taper i get sucked back into buying another kilo. And every time I buy a kilo, the quality gets worse and worse.  The latest kilo i bought on 11/15 had zero kratom in it at all. I have reason to believe it's actually akuamma because it turns a total dark brown instead of the green it normally should be. Another reason i think it's akuamma is because it actually keeps my withdrawals at bay every time i dose. 

I ended up buying small batches of three other kratoms in crazy desperation for the next buzz but every single one of them are absolutely bunk. Haven't been able to catch a buzz at all. It's like the universe is forcing me to finally throw in the towel. Weirdly enough -- I'm actually very grateful because this has been a long time coming.

My last buzz was on 11/14. Despite the akuamma keeping the majority of the WD at bay, yesterday (day 3) was probably the worst I've felt all week. I wish I knew how much the mu opioid receptors (speciosa) and the other opioid receptors (hirsuta & akuamma) crossover because i want to know how close i am to being able to jump. i have no frame of reference since akuamma is a completely new substance to my body.  


Regardless, I am not sure if it's practical to actually say this, but in my mind i feel like i've been off kratom for 4 days now. I say this because i haven't gotten high at all. And all this bunk kratom is doing is providing my brain the negative reinforcement that it needs to overwrite the habit/addiction.

I'll keep dropping my dose of this nonsense stuff over the course of the next few days and continue to test how many hours I can go before I start to feel WD conditions I can't perform at work at.

At this point I'm convinced that all the kratom in my city (houston tx) is absolutely BS and that I'll never be able to successfully use again. Which is exactly the mindset that I need to continue reinforcing so that I can finally let this damn addiction go for once and for all.

I've been fighting with myself to make a thread in this sub for the last 4 days but finally worked up the strength to do it. I've been studying the threads in this sub for strength, and I am really grateful for the people on here who share their experience. I'm even more grateful for those who are still posting here even after 3 or 6 months or even years after they successfully quit. It's very inspiring and I'm really looking forward to getting control of my life back!

Here's to my fellow quitters. I'm really praying I can do it for real this time. The universe seems to be forcing me to, anyhow.",9

This will be a sight ramble with no editing:

The point of this post is - I remember how hard it was the first week. Physical withdrawals like I could never imagine. No sleep for days. But, to be honest after those left it was almost embarrassingly easy to never be tempted by kratom again. I know it’s different for everyone so I’m just saying what happened to me - I have no desire to do kratom again since surviving the withdrawals. You can do it and once you pass that first month you will have a fresh perspective on your struggle and probably have an easy time leaving it alone. The first few weeks are the hardest! Taper for the first few days but guess what you will go through hell no matter what. Good luck to you all, it’s worth quitting and easier to stay clean after the first week or two of hell 👍",25

It has been at least a couple months since I last posted on here, but felt the strong need to. I just need to get a few things off my mind/chest that have really been bothering me lately. And don't get me wrong, my wife is the all-around loveliest person I know of and I tell her everything/anything these days, but sometimes I feel like she just does not quite fully understand some of the things I struggle with (mostly mentally) because she has been fortunate enough to have never gone through the hell of being an addict. She has her own struggles as we all do, but this one in particular, and all that comes with it, is alien to her.  God bless her, she will always listen and give a great response, but I also like hearing from many other different viewpoints as well.

Back in August, I tapered down quite a bit from about 50-60 GDP to around 10 GPD in a few weeks time, and then just jumped off completely 4 days before my daughter was born in late August. And, I actually was COMPLETELY off of this crap for 2 whole weeks. I felt very good about the direction of things, despite the lack of energy, sadness, and all the rest that comes with it. Then a really bad day at work was the catalyst that lead to me saying ""screw it"", and I stopped and grabbed some slime at the gas station while I was out working delivering my route. I told myself it would not continue on, but just be a one time thing...and here we are, 3 months later and tapering down to nothing again from about 15 GPD currently. 

I just wanted to post to vent a little (sorry again) and say that I just feel like a complete failure and hopeless case. I want to just leave it behind so bad, but feel like life is so demanding of me in all areas that it would be nearly impossible. Not only that, the thing that gets me even worse that the physical side of it, is surely the mental. I have always had very low self esteem, and being a functioning drug addict/father/husband for 7+ years has not helped with that one bit. I am constantly, CONSTANTLY beating myself up mentally over it all. Rolling past mistakes and regrets around in my mind, relentlessly hurling insults and criticisms at myself, and incessantly reminding myself that I am a loser and a lost cause. 

I am sadly at a point where I feel like the damage is done. I know it is not deep down, but I just can't seem to give myself a break and feel like such a piece of shit. The past will just not seem to leave me be. It haunts me all day, every day. Like, ""Why did things have to be that way for so many years?"" It just really sucks. I know we are also supposed to just give our cares over to God and trust in his words, but I am not even sure if I have gone too far in my awfulness even for him. I always feel like I have committed far too many terrible and unpardonable acts/sins at this point. I know that is most likely untrue as well, but I just can't shake the feeling. I'll leave it be right there...this board has always had so many wonderful and intelligent folks, I honestly would not know really know who else to talk/vent to if it were not for the Quitting K reddit sub. Many thanks, much love, and prayer to you all...if I ever make it to the other side of the fence, I vow to commit my life to helping others who are struggling with issues of addiction and self worth. Have a lovely day folks...

It’s selfish because I end up being more distant, isolated, and absolutely miserable. 

Since picking back up, this stuff has brought be nothing but pain. Constant guilt and mental anguish ‘this is my last one’ over and over again.  I recently got up to 14 days and threw it away because I couldn’t handle the PAWS. 

I know for sure I won’t figure out my true feelings about my relationship, make any progress is any area of my life, and least of all be happy if I continue to use.

Does anyone else get debilitating brain fog while on kratom or coming off of it. It’s been about 3-4 months since I’ve done kratom only (was on subs for 5 years and finally got off by using kratom). Now I’ve tapered down from 25 GPD to now only 3 GPD of Kratom.

However, everyday I have debilitating brain fog. It feels like I experience reality through a muddy window. I have snowy vision, I can’t think complexly or nearly as sharp, I feel so fucking stupid and I used to be very sharp cognitively.

I can’t retain complex information or study.

Reality is beginning to feel fake to me, where I disassociate from everything completely. It really feels like a simulation, I feel like a stranger in my own mind.

Idk if I can go on living like this, so I hope it’s just the kratom or perhaps lingering effects of being off subs (it’s been 3 months since I’ve been off of them).

Any advice would help, I’m really losing hope here. This is no way to experience life. I wouldn’t wish this brain fog on my worst enemy, I’d rather do heroin again than experience this.",13

Hey everyone…just wanted to ask some questions here as I just had bloodwork comeback and my numbers were very low. I didn’t even know my doc was testing for this.  I guess he threw it in the bloodwork when he heard my symptoms. 

I’m pretty active..5’10 170. I’ve had some GI issues and started taking Kratom about 8 months ago daily. No more than 5 grams/day. I stopped the day I got these results. 

From what I am reading on here, 191 is very low. My free T was 26. I’m going to workout like crazy and see if they go up. My doc wants to retest in 6-8 weeks.

Can such a low kratom dosage tank levels that low? 

I have all the symptoms of low T. I really don’t want to start TRT for the rest of my life. My wife and I just had a baby 8 months ago and we want to have another one soon, as we are getting up there in age.

Anyway, just wanted to introduce myself and get some feedback on my situation. I’m pretty bummed out by it. Has anyone recovered from levels this low after quitting without TRT?

Thanks

About 5-6 weeks after I quit I randomly started getting cystic type breakouts on my jawline and neck. I haven’t had breakouts in over a decade, so it was really surprising. I honestly can’t think of anything else in my lifestyle or diet that has changed besides my quitting Kratom so I can’t help but think it’s related to my hormones/testosterone levels being out of whack. I just am surprised it’s taking this long to even out as I’m still dealing with painful breakouts. Has anyone else here experienced this? If so, did it eventually work itself out? Is there anything I can do to speed up the process or is it just a waiting game? Any insight is greatly appreciated here.",4

A lot of ppl here pointed out that the numbers printed on the bag usually are not at all accurate and the actual alkaloid content could be way different. Anyway when I switched strains I initially increased the dose by 20% to compensate for the lower potency, but even after the adjustment it was taking more kratom to keep the withdrawals away and I had been at a pretty low dose on my taper (5gpd), but with the new strain it was taking around 10gpd (sometimes more). Today, I stopped at a smoke shop to pickup another strain (different brand too) to see how much it would take to keep the withdrawals at bay. So far I've been feeling fine taking smaller doses, I think the one batch I got that wasn't working was probably a bad batch with either extremely low potency or possibly cut down with filler (I've had some kratom in the past that had so much filler I could actually off color particles in the powder). Anyway, I'm glad to know my tolerance wasn't the issue and it was just bad K, before I switched strains I was thinking heavily of jumping since 5gpd was extremely low, I'm still considering it, but I've been struggling to mentally prepare, but I'm hoping switching to a new batch I'll be able to get back on track with my taper, even if I'm not quite ready to jump, having a lower daily dose gives me more confidence that I'm a step closer to finishing the taper. Also, the thought of how much garbage and filler could be in the kratom I'm taking is going to a good motivator to stay off it this time",6

And it sucks, the glory days are over and my body is malnourished and I am chronically constipated. I have developed more anxiety and occasional panic attacks in the past months but it's been building for I believe years, I just wasn't aware much of it as I don't have much self-care practice in the past. 
    I was at one point at 11-18gpd. I'm now slowly (with some bumps in the road) on around 6.5-10 gpd. It's very tedious and if I get close to 10-11g in a day I feel ashamed and more depressed. I have tons of school I need to catch up on, and my focus sucks on anything.( I most likely have an attention deficit disorder with anxiety/depression but i don't self diagnose cause it's biased). 
    I would love to taper a day or two more and then go through whatever withdrawal I need to go through and start getting back to just weed for the time being. I have particularly bad constipation even though I've been eating a lot of fiber. But it's probably because I took too much to get sleep last night (another dumb setback) 
   Another issue is I'm tapering two substances at the moment or trying my hardest and as much as I want to be physically and mentally better I don't know how to do this alone. Many of my friends and all of my family doesn't know about my usage. I need to do this for myself in all aspects but I just have no vested interests in life and don't feel like I'm accomplishing anything being behind in school and struggling to find work. 
   I do not have any solid friends here at school. (Most of them have dropped out/graduated if they were a real one). With little availability from my family due to them being in the dark/not having time for me I'm just so lost and wish I could just keep some sort of will power for more than a day. I know this process isn't easy but I just don't trust myself to stick with it at all. At the end of the day I hate the substances but they do still half the time relieve boredom, horrible depression and anxiousness about everything. 
  This was kinda just written off the dome and have never really voiced a piece of my life like this to random ppl. I just don't know where to turn anymore and don't want to let myself give in to breaking the taper every other day or so. I want to choose life but the steps I keep falling over cause I got impulsivity up the ass. Advice?",5

I use a small piece of wax paper and tare it to 0. Then I measure using 2 tsp and a little extra. 
I notice if I move the powder around on the scale like where the pile of powder sits, it  fluctuates like crazy. I dont know if it's too much powder one small travel scale surface or what is the problem.

I’ve finally made the decision that it’s time to get off of Kratom for good. I’ve felt enslaved to the green beast for a few years now but never wanted to face the WDs that were in my future. I’ve used daily for about 6 years now. At the highest I was using 9-12 gpd split into 3-4 doses throughout the day. From what I’ve read thats a relatively mild dose. 

In August I contracted COVID and though I was never admitted to the hospital struggled with it to the extent in made me reevaluate my health and the substances I was putting into my body. I recently tapered off a mild phenibut dependency with success. A little trial and error and it was pretty painless. This has given me the confidence to taper off Kratom. 

I dropped back to two 2.4 gram doses a day about 2.5 months ago where I’ve been holding steady since. Last week I decided I would shave off .25 grams every 5th day until I reach 0. I recently lost my job and have been dealing with some RUQ discomfort that has been alarming. I’ve decided to hold off looking for work until the 1st of the year in order to get my health in order and try to get as low as possible with a taper. I believe I can get down to 2 gpd at the rate I’m going by the 1st. 

I’m currently down to 4.25 gpd. I know this is a slow taper but my wife is dealing with the loss of her mother so I need to be there for her. I don’t want to add any additional stress to her if possible. I expect minor WDs but I believe by going slow I can mitigate those and hopefully mitigate PAWS which makes me most nervous. 

I haven’t felt that lovely Kratom feeling in a week now and while I do miss it, I still feel good and want to be out doing things. I’m grateful I never got carried away with my usage but do expect some sort of WD as I used daily for a long time. Reading other’s experiences on this forum has inspired me. I’m excited to be free from this in the next few months and not have to worry about meal timing and how I’m going to travel with it. Thanks for the good vibes and good luck to you all!",16

How do I fill the gap? How can I swap out the ritual? Please don't say exercise lol (already doing that). 

I have nothing else really, I mean I drink a lot of coffee which is a ritual I love. I need to find some way to replace this fixation with something else.

It’s hot gradually more over time as these things do, but I’ve been exclusively on extract shots for about a year or more. Before that was powder and/or capsules for maybe 2-2.5 years regularly before that. 

Was only about two months ago that I had everything set up perfect to finally quit for good. I quit CT and made it to day 9. I felt great.....unfortunately too great. I was able to trick myself into believing I could seriously take just one this one day since I was SO over it. Then I said man just one more this next day and obviously everybody here knows how that went.

So I started the new Big Quit by taking my last shot Sunday evening. It’s been almost 2 days and tougher than I remember.

What I do remember is how much this community helped me, so that’s why I’m back. I hate myself for starting back up (of course) but I also feel like maybe that was the plan all along. All night the last two nights I hardly slept at all & all I could think was how fucking stupid I was to put myself thru this all again.

But I can only hope that when day 9 rolls around again I’ll have enough fortitude not to put myself thru it a 3rd time. So I’m hoping my relapse is just what I needed to really quit for good. 

Any kind words would be so helpful. Every night I couldn’t sleep on my first quit I would lay in bed reading thru this sub and particularly the comments of inspiration people had sent me & I found it really helpful. You guys & gals are all truly the best.

2021-11-16 13:10:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/qve2gt/90_days_clean_some_thoughts/,90 days clean! Some thoughts.,"Can't believe it's been 90 days since my jump. I used 30-40 gpd for 10 years straight, tapered for 6 weeks and jumped on 8/18. I used gabapentin for the first 10 days after jumping.

Things haven't been easy these past three months. My acutes were mild, thanks to the taper and the gabapentin. After the acutes and after the gabapentin I rolled straight into some PAWS stuff. Thankfully the depression part of PAWS missed me. The anxiety was my thing. 24 hours after stopping the gabapentin I was waking up every hour with a very high heart rate and a brain stewing in anxiety.

The very acute anxiety lasted for nearly two weeks before it started to rapidly decrease. This was very welcome, however, sleep did not improve for a few more weeks. IIRC I was just under 60 days when I slept uninterrupted. Thankfully sleep has been good since then. I still struggle when first falling asleep, but once I'm down I sleep like a baby.

I had really bad RLS during my taper, and mild but -enduring- RLS since the jump. I -still- have some lingering RLS issue. They appear right around the time I'm going to bed and these days is just felt in my ankle area. I try to exhaust my leg muscles everyday with some exercise, which helps, but the shadow the the RLS is still there, sadly.

I also still feel some slight prickly sensation all over my body when I first wake up and in random occurrences through the day. This is the final form of the ""burning skin"" sensation that a lot of us get during the acutes. It's totally manageable right now, and has been for most of these 90 days, but it is still there.

Oh, and I also still get into some marathon yawning sessions.

So things are going well, but I'm definitely not back to normal yet.

Throughout all of this I have never once regretted making the jump. Despite the anxiety, the icky nerves, the sweating, the RLS, it has been 100% worth it. 

If you're a long time user scared about jumping, please know that even if it isn't easy it is still so much better than one more day chained to Kratom. I just don't have to worry about that shit -at all- anymore and it is priceless.

If you're not a longtime user but my 90 days of RLS is freaking you out, don't worry. I'm pretty sure the RLS has continued this long because I used for a decade. That's a lot of chemistry to undo, and my body is still working it out.

I’m quitting again because GI issues got bad. I had awful constipation, but have since been able to go. Now I have the constant feeling like I need to go but can’t, rectum pain, lower back pain, and until yesterday occasional severe pain in lower-left abdomen. Last night it migrated to the center abdomen. I saw my doctor on Friday and return this Friday and he gave me a sample of trulance (plecanatide) to take.

I only did kratom daily for a few weeks at a time and only started at all less than 3 months ago.

My question is; should this stuff linger for me with that short a period of use?",4

Tapered to 12 gpd pretty quickly from 28, took about 2 weeks to taper to 6, then jumped. My wd symptoms were blessedly mild. NO RLS, only mild insomnia, the lethargy and depression were kind of a bitch, but honestly not that bad.
I had been so, so worried about the acute withdrawal that I didn't consider what came after. 
At day 9 I was physically pretty much back to normal. Definitely by day 11. Then....the boredom. The anxiety. And I cracked. Started back at 2gpd and slowly found my way back up to 28gpd.
So, today I restart my taper to 12, going to jump at 6 and I'm so scared that I will fail again.
This forum kept me sane last time, so here's hoping it gets me through it this time.
I'm taking high doses of liposomal vit C, passionflower extract at night for sleep and I do still have some clonidine, though truthfully I don't know that it helped much. I would be grateful for any tips or suggestions.
Bless you all who are trying to free yourselves from this chain!!",8

You can imagine how tonight and this morning is going. I managed to ""quit"" for two months earlier this year, but then slid back into usage for another 2 months. I honestly feel like that ""break"" I took was mostly spent trying to get back to normal, but I kinda went from withdrawal straight into PAWS. 

I could use some encouragement. Not only does repeating this process is absolutely wracking my brain, I just can't get through the PAWS and anhedonia, a few months later. I start feeling better, pretty much normal, and all of a sudden I cannot control the urge and slip as much as 5 months into recovery. I hope I can get through this again. Definitely gets harder or at least more annoying each time. I've tried many things from hypnotherapy to exercise to improved diet, you name it. While all of that seems to improve my well being, eventually I just completely lose interest or desire to do anything. And start seeing kratom as my only option.

Hopefully y'all are staying strong.",10

I used Kratom as a crutch for every possible scenario in my life. I tried dozens of times to quit but this time it’s actually sticking. I’ve never made it past a day before. Now I’m 6 going on 7 days without consuming Kratom. I’m gonna tell you how I’ve managed so far: 

1. You gotta, gotta be nice to yourself. What this means for me was watching movies, going on walks, eating healthy or playing video games. Something to distract you from the fact that this shit is leaving your system. The first 4 days I was pretty much posted up in bed but allowed myself to do that. I was uncomfortable as hell but I just tried to dive into a good movie, write or just listen to music. 

2. Supplements. I used CBD with Turmeric, ashwaghanda, L- Theanine, and KAVA. Definitely helps keep the edge off. Also use Advil if you need to keep the pain and chills
Away if needed

3. This is gonna sound hokey but make Kratom your bitch. Yell at it, scream at it, curse at it. Make it known that it’s time to stop. Throw that shit away. Spit on the bag and be motherfuckin proud of yourself that your aren’t going to let this control your life anymore. 

4. If tempted to relapse. Think of the why you want to stop in the first place. Know that it gets  better. It does. The first few days were like me trying to learn to walk again. I wanted it, I even drove to get some but I had to remember why I was stopping. 

I just wanted to post this because this is an awesome group and I believe in every single one of y’all. Kratom was a life changer in the beginning but turned malevolent in the end. I never in a million years thought I could go a single day without it. I’ve gone 6 now. I’m still alive. I’m not always comfortable but that’s ok. Best of luck and hit me in DM’s if you have any questions",23

Just looking for help,"I've been reading posts on this thread for awhile now. I've used kratom on and off for the past 2 years. Originally I was only on small doses. 3-6 GPD for a few months and gradually worked up to 8-10 GPD over the course of the year. Where I lived at the time kratom was not easily accessible. I had to drive 30min one way to a head shop that had some bad quality stuff. I had to order it online and wait a week to get it so that made it easier to quit. I went on a 3 day backpacking trip without any and after that I was done. I also had lots of friends where I lived at the time, we were all very active and so my mind was easily distracted. Anyway, that quit was fairly easy but only lasted a few months until I said ""I'll just get one bag and do it on occasions"". Bullshit.

I started using again at the same doses, daily. I was doing great at work and it didn't seem to affect anything, but it made my nights alone enjoyable. Snap forward to the present..

I wanted a change and landed in good job in a new state, so I moved to Colorado and kratom is everywhere. My intake jumped to 15-25 GPD and it's been about 9 months. I really want to quit and last night decided to kick it after I finished my bag. I made it over 24 hours with minor withdrawals until it got dark and boredom set in. Usually I would go on a bike ride or something but here's the thing.. I broke my arm a couple weeks ago and can't ride my bike which is my passion. So I went out and bought a couple ounces tonight. I'm upset with myself for doing that after making it past the 24 hour mark. I justified it in my head due to my broken arm and being bored and lonely. Another huge obstacle for me is that I can't smoke MJ at the moment due to getting my CDL license, after a decade of daily use. I told myself it will be easier to quit when I can actually ride my bike and be with my girlfriend.

My girlfriend and I have been long distance for about a year but would make time to see eachother like every other month. She doesn't know about my addiction currently, but I did inform her of my previous addiction after I kicked it. I'm moving to the Las Vegas area to be with her in a few weeks and I really really want to quit before I move in with her.

So I guess what I'm getting at is.. has anyone tried to quit with an obstacle such as a broken bone and being lonely? Should I just go CT or taper? Should I wait until my mental state is better (can ride my bike and spend time with my girl)? What kind of coping mechanisms did you use?

I really appreciate you all and any comments will help. 

Much love ✌",5

While the Wellbutrin seemed to be working initially,  the past two days have been not so great. Trouble waking up, and the general fuzziness, lack of motivation, and adhedonia.

This is my first post on this forum. I'm posting to give encouragement to anyone trying or wanting to quit.  I've gotten a lot of support and advice from reading success stories here and tips for quitting kratom. I used kratom for years as a way to stay away from worse things, but it became obvious that the amount and the frequency I was taking kratom was affecting my personal life. It came between my most important relationships, kept me from travelling because of worry about when and if I'd be able to have it when I traveled, and generally was a ball and chain around me when I considered doing anything. I took kratom for a few years and at my highest point I don't know how much I was taking and I didn't care. I took it multiple times a day whenever I felt like it. It felt like it was helping and it was legal so I thought it was alright, but I realized it had as much of a grip on me as anything did in the past has. I used the tapering method with support and accountability from my girlfriend and best friend and it was amazing how well it worked. It was difficult, but nowhere near impossible. With the tapering method there is no pressure of when to drop to the lower dose, but you cannot cheat. Whatever you set for your dose for the day (set it ahead of time), you stick to it. Before long I had built the confidence that i could get through work and the normal stress of life without it. It didn't take too much longer before I had built the confidence to drop my last dose and I've been kratom free for 18 days. It may not seem like a long time to some, but I didn't think I'd ever be off of it. I'm still not 100%, but I'm about 90-95 % and not having the stress of always thinking about if and when I'll be able to take a dose has been life changing. I see now that it was always possible, just scary to try to go on without it. I was closer to being able to quit than I realized. It takes a strict plan, support and accountability from loved ones, and honesty with yourself, but it can be done. I hope this helps someone out there. Wishing the best for anyone struggling with this. You can do it!",19

I've been taking 3 grams 2-3 times a day. i'm still dealing with withdrawals in between doses but i can feel a difference already. It went from being in terrible pain, nausea, and shaking, to just feeling like i have the flu. I just made it 16 hours and was still up walking around!

&#x200B;

Still every time i drop my dose down or remove a dose from my schedule it really gets to me mentally. If your just starting to quit this is something your going to have to really prepare yourself for, it gets rough. My dose is over 80% lower than when i started but i still have days where i just cry, i feel like its hopeless and that i haven't actually made any progress because i still get ""sick"".

I didn't know who needs to hear it but that voice isn't really you. Its just part of the process and i think its best to just accept that. It's okay to feel bad, all you can do is push through it, but how you push through is up to you to decide. If you try something and your making progress keep doing it, if i stops working switch to something else, when that stops working go back to the first method. Just don't up your dose and you'll get there.

&#x200B;

There were periods that I needed to breath for a day or two, i think that is fine as long as you never up your dose. It's easier said than done i know but it really helped me when i switched to capsules and wrote down my dosing schedules on paper. I also dropped my doses down more than i thought i could handle because that way if i slipped up it would be okay because it would still be lower than my previous schedule for the day, and if i made it through then i felt great because i made extra progress.

2021-11-15 13:58:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/qunlob/day_26_fatigue/,Day 26 - Fatigue,"Hi everyone, 

I am on day 26 from about 5 months of daily use probably averaging around 15 GPD. This is my 2nd quit, having quit 2 years ago from around 20 GPD for somewhere around 16 months or so. My first quit was pretty easy. Once I made the jump, I was feeling pretty good after about a week or so. 

I am feeling a lot better than the first few weeks with a few exceptions. The major one being nasty fatigue. I wake up in the morning exhausted and can't seem to get motivated to do anything until the afternoon. I am in a fortunate situation as I am still working from home, but my productivity over the last 4 weeks has nosedived. 

What complicates things is that I had major surgery on my hip 2 weeks ago so I am still recovering from that and can't do excessive exercise or long walks yet (though I have been doing stretches, some upper body workouts and the exercise bike with little resistance). I was prescribed an opioid to deal with post surgery pain and I am sure that has slowed my recovery. It's been 8 days since I have used any drug, though I wasn't abusing the painkillers - only took as prescribed for pain control. 

So far in my quit 26 days out:

**The good:**

* Sleeping 6-8 hours a night
* Most physical symptoms have resolved
* No more GI issues 
* I get brief glimpses of ""normal""
* Appetite has returned 
* RLS is more manageable 
* Depression and anxiety are manageable 
* No cravings

**The bad:**

* Fatigue is killer
* Lack of motivation
* Sex drive still low, but seems to be returning
* Anhedonia is very real 
* Some very transient aches, sweats and sneezing

Right now, the big thing is the fatigue. I just want to sleep and not work, which is not normal for me. I know I have it better than a lot of folks, but I suppose I just needed to vent. I've also read other posts where these types of symptoms seem to be normal at this timeframe, but damn, this really caught me off guard based on how my last quit went. 

At any rate, just needed to vent. Hope you are doing well wherever you are at in your quit. Upwards and onwards.",10

Instead of just outright reducing my dose, I try to wait as long as I possibly can after waking up to take my first dose. Once I take that first dose I’ll take kratom as needed until going to bed. But waiting so long makes that first dose hit way harder so I’m still taking way less than normal after that first dose. 

Out of the dozens of times I’ve tried to quit, this seems like by far the best approach for me personally. Kratom makes me an extremely unproductive person, content with doing fucking nothing for myself. I’ve found that I am so much more productive during the day now, since I constantly seek out stuff to do to distract me from the WD’s and am not held back by kratom’s numbing effect. I’ve started lifting, going on long walks, playing guitar, and reading, none of which I would have ever done while on kratom.

For anyone struggling to cold turkey or taper in traditional ways, I cannot recommend this enough. It is so much easier to dramatically reduce your dose this way, and you can still actually sleep at night. I cut my dose by more than half by day 3 with little trouble, which I never even came close to in any other taper. Seriously try it. And make sure to take magnesium glycinate to help with the RLS!",16

Only a couple hours in and I’m still having to battle the intrusive thoughts of “just go get another Oz” I leave for HI in just over 3 weeks, I need to get better.

Any support is greatly appreciated, I am weak and boredom is what triggers me, any tips or tricks to stay on the ship would be great. And inkling on what I’m about to face (symptom wise) would be great as wel. 

Wish me luck!",39

So I’m like close to 2 months off kratom at this point and I have been feeling AMAZING and totally normal. It took about 5 weeks for me to get back to 100% but that being said, I felt 100% so I thought drinking would be fine since I usually never drink. We had a huge friendsgiving at my house on Friday night and y’all I haven’t been drunk like that since my 21st birthday lol. It was an awesome time. But Saturday, Sunday and today I’ve woken up with that all too familiar racing heart anxiety as soon as I open my eyes. I guess I’m just checking to see if you all have noticed something similar. It’s nothing like the first couple of weeks, more like it feels like I’m back towards the beginning of the 3rd or 4th week of WD. So it’s manageable, but I just hate anxiety so much. I figured I was far enough away from the WD it wouldn’t interfere with it at all! Let me know what you guys think.",13

2021-11-15 08:54:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/qugy9g/i_cant_afford_this_anymore/,I can't afford this anymore,"Both money-wise and emotionally. 

I'm 25 years old and I just moved to a new city. Kratom is completely draining my resources. It was one thing when I lived at home with barely any bills to pay. But now I'm making only about $2300 a month with $1200 a month in bills and almost the entirety of my extra money has been going to kratom. 

I started taking it in high school about 8 years ago. Got pretty addicted to it for a couple years and managed to kick it on my own for about 2 years. Then about 3 years ago I started working at a factory where drugs were rampant, and one guy in particular was constantly taking kratom and adderall and giving me some. I wasn't strong enough to turn it down and it started all over again, 10x worse now that I was making a solid amount of money. I moved in with my friends and got evicted - by my own friend - *and* had my car repoed because I was so bad at managing my money. I had more than enough to live the life I wanted but threw it away for kratom. 

I got a new job, moved back home, and started saving money. I never stopped using but I thought I was doing better. I thought I was managing it. I moved up really quickly at my new job, thanks in no small part to the energy and focus I credited to kratom. I took a risk and moved to a big city to try and live the life I've always wanted. And instead I've spent most of my free time holed up in my apartment because I'm constantly broke and can't afford to do any of the things I came here to do. I've been so depressed. I feel like a failure. I feel like I've lost myself again. And I'm tired of feeling that way. I know if I get rid of this habit, things will be so much better. But I'm so scared. Scared of the anxiety and withdrawals that come with quitting. Scared of being forced to confront my choices. Scared of failing at work because I'm suffering and can't tell them why. Scared of disappointing my family and my parents again. Especially my dad who has been so proud of me for this move. 

But it's time. I can not quit CT because of my job. I know that sounds like an excuse but it's true. I've tried and the WDs make me incapable of working. But I know I can get through the days on small doses. So it starts today. I'm taking 8 grams with me to work and leaving the rest here. I will do that for a week or two, I think. Then it will go down to 6, then 4, then 2, then nothing. And I may feel uncomfortable but I'll survive. 

And, most importantly, I'm going to tell my dad. The thought terrifies me but I know he'll support me. He knew of my first round with kratom. But I'm going home this weekend and I can't do it in secret. 

Anyway, I needed to write this out. I'm going to use this sub to hold myself accountable. Thanks for reading.",28

This sub was pivotal in my eventual recovery. This sub let me finally tap into my own inherant longing to be free.

I struggled so hard so so long. I became physically weak. My dick stopped working. My life broke. My marriage was starined to the max. I kept so many secrets. The only one in my life happy with me, was my boss: ""Heard you been coming in at 4AM, Jon. Amazing dedication!""

Except, I came in at 4am because other boss, green slavemaster, always woke me up at 230 or 3am to dose. Once the devil was satisfied, then I could go serve my other master.

I tried so hard, tapering at one point down to just a couple grams from 100 over 3 months. Every time, I would fail near the end. 10 times. 20 times. But victory is achieved standing up 1 more time. And then 1 more. 

At the end of my own ability to power through, I enrolled myself in a vodeo outpatient drugrehab for opiate addicts using medication assisted treatment in, July 2020. This MAT option is, (or was at the time), highly frowned upon in this sub. And I generally agree, if there is a way to break free without jumping from one addictive substence to another, dobit. But I could not. MAT has a decent success rate. Honestly I would've tried anythign to break free, even to the point of DMT hallucinogenics (but I didn't have a source).

So I tried MAT. Felt I had to do it. And in so doing, I traded the high of green devil for the equal energetic, but more stable, high of an even more powerfully addictive opiate, Rx suboxone. 

I began on a dose of 4mg. It was a very easy transition. And after throwing away all the articles of the former addiction (for the new one), months passed, and kratom was solidly in the rearview. Over time, my brain delinked it. There were zero cravings. Zero depression, zero wds, zero paws. And obviously, this is because I was still getting high, but on a diferent drug.

Next came the path to kicking the subs. But for numerous practical reasons, tapering these was far more managable for me. Compared to kraton, ot was almost too easy by comparison. Not everyone will have this experience, of course (a friend of mine has been taking subs for over 10 years and may be a lifer), but this was mine.

Tapering on MAT was easy because of the single dosing scheme. It was easy because I was able to maintain exceptional control over the accuracy of the measure. And ever, ever so slowly, I tapered down to 0.25mg. And there I stayed till Sep 2021. 3 months ago, I finally jumped. But I allowed myself to brodge-dose, finding jyst 0.125mg was enough to eliminate the late night RLS and did this every other night. Then every 3rd, and finally, 2 mos ago, it was over. I'm finally, truly, clean. It didnt hurt. I feel ok. Finally, after so long, I am free and never looking back.

The journey that began here, with all of you encouragers, has finally cone to an end. A few days ago my dick started working again. 

I want to thank you all for your courage, inspiration, and dedication to your own respective journeys. Thank you for inspiring me to walk the path of resistance to obtain freedom. Today is the day I finally removed the last emergency strip of this drug from my wallet. My last crutch, my final what-if-you-cant-cope, strip. Because I dont need it any more. I'm stronger than ever. This has been a worthy journey. And truly, although it's not a journey I'd EVER want to have to repeat, I'm glad I went. No regrets.

I have more love for you, you dear, beautiful strangers, my brothers and sisters, than you could ever know.",44

Last time I stocked back up on kratom I couldn't get my usual strain, so I bought another one I was familiar with, but according to the package it's about 20% less alkaloid content, I made an adjustment of 20% to my doses to even it out. However even after making the adjustment I've been having much stronger cravings, physical withdrawals have been coming back too, but not as bad as the cravings. since switching I've had 2 days that I panicked and kept redosing until the cravings/withdrawals went away. The first day I redosed I ended up doing 13g in total that day, the second time it happened it took 11g for the day to get cravings/withdrawals under control. I know switching strains is not recommended for a taper, but I'm wondering what my best plan of action is to get back on track. My biggest concern is how much I may have messed up my tolerance by having 2 days I went over my taper limit. I know for me it takes about 5 days to really see how much my body has adjusted to a new dose, so I won't really know how bad I messed up my tolerance until later in the week. The other big concern I have is switching strains, I'm worried there may be a big enough difference between the strains that even if my tolerance isn't effed up, that the strain won't be enough to stay functional without upping dose significantly. I know I'm in the home stretch of the taper and even if I did mess up my tolerance it shouldn't take that long to get back to where I was, but I'm just so panicked rn about it and having gone through WD's twice (once CT once taper) in the past 18 months I'm really going hard on myself about it bc I do not want to relapse again. Also, anyone with experience with similar situations, should I switch back to the strain I started my taper with or stay with the new one once I'm used to it?",3

Using around a shot and half a day for 7 months, decided to test a cold Turkey run this weekend with 5mg edible. 

1st day of edible no Kratom- knocked on my ass the entire day from edible. Stoned out of my mind. Didn’t even think about kratom. If someone offered, I woulda passed respectively. Nighttime- edible still on cruise control, slept with like a baby throughout the night. 10/10 day.

2nd day no kratom- same thing, 5mg in the morning, stoned off my ass until 5pm. Took a nice nap, no urge at all to use. Broke off another half of edible around bedtime and for some reason it ROCKED my shit. Woke up @12 high as a kite some paranoia but I squashed it and got another 7hr of sleep. 9/10 day.

This morning- work up fine, my nose was really runny, took a big poop. Didn’t take a edible and no urge to use again tbh. I feel refreshed, no withdrawal and the first time in a while, I’m not thinking about the sludge. If I start to feel some WDs my plan is just to take a small piece of the edible and ride it out again. 

Conclusion- very surprised on how effective a small amount of THC is basically destroying WD symptoms. Let’s see if I can utilize this method the entire week and keep up with minimizing WDs. Will update again",13

For the longest time I didn't think any of these supplements did jack. Probably because I was thinking like an addict. I was expecting something big and euphoric, and I wasn't getting that. Its a super subtle feeling you don't really notice until you take those supplements away. 

I've been keeping a journal of how much kratom I take every day as i've tapered down from about 60 GPD to around 4 or 5 GPD now. I've noticed on days I forget to take these supplements my dosage is higher. I'll catch myself counting the seconds til my next dose, or just saying screw it and taking more kratom than I had planned. Days like today, where I do take them, I still hurt, but I'm better at handling it.

Feeling better, sleep is key, gabapentin and compression socks are a huge help.","As the title says, it’s been 41 hours since my last dose 4pm on Friday. The first night was absolute torture. I hate it and wanted to dose every 5 minutes. But you have to push through. The second day was hard as well, luckily I had a lot to do for work that kept my mind off of it, but I was part zombie. I had some left over gabapentin from when I quit 2 years ago, I took 600mg last night around 10pm. It was a very interesting night. I woke up all the time but by 4am I think I slept till 8:30 and now I feel way way better. Still feel a little loopy from the gaba. If you’re struggling with sleep, go see a doctor get some help. You’re not alone in this fight, and for me gaba has been a life savor. I can’t imagine walking into this hour with no sleep since Thursday. 


But I’ve been having heart issue and high blood pressure, and I think Kratom was the culprit. I won’t know till I’m off of it but my BP hasn’t spiked since. So that was my biggest motivation the first night to quit, throw away all my Kratom, clean up that little corner of my room that’s full of Kratom powder from weighing it out. 

This time I’m done and never looking back. It’s not worth it. I want to be more productive with my life moving forward. We’re only given one life, now I i want to live it. 

P.S. get some compression socks, I wore those last night and barely felt any RLS, and I’ve battled Restless Leg my whole life, it’s one reason I enjoy Kratom so much, it got rid of ym RLS and allowed me to sleep. But give it enough time that Kratom turns on you. 

Cheers, and I hope everyone the best. I hope these next few days are better than the last ones.",8

I went back to using because everyone who was pro kratom told me no way it was the kratom. Welp it definitley is. The inflammation in my body including my hair follicles are nonexistent when I’m not using kratom. It HAS to be the problem. I think it literally gave me a kratom induced lichen planopilaris. Everything makes so much sense and matches up. EVERYTHING. I will update a few months from now to show you guys if I’ve had any improvements with my hair loss. I have been keeping track with photos. I am at the very beginning with a quit but I’m confident this past year of trauma due to my hair falling out will be over soon. I was also getting allergic conjunctivitis when I started having these issues as well. If you notice any hair fall on kratom quit asap. I waited way longer than I should have. Don’t be me.

All I got was some uncomfortable cravings on the car ride there. Later I was able to socialize and just hang out. So far so good. We’ll see how tomorrow goes when there are a lot more people here.",6

Long story short I had 9 years in recovery from all mind altering substances.  Opiates were my drug of choice.  I’ve always known to stay away from kratom because I’ve heard the stories and any dummy can see how closely related it is with other opiates.  Last March I was in Mexico I was on an extended trip, it was my first time being a “digital nomad”.  I felt on top of the world.  It was also the beginning of a new relationship with the current love of my life.  What a blessing it’s been to have her in my life.  But at the time I was starting to have a lot of anxiety about what it meant for my “freedom” and being in a relationship.  My heart wanted monogamy but I was also scared.  I was eating at a restaurant in Tulum, MX and they had kratom on the menu.  I gave in to the temptation.  I loved the feeling.  Reassured myself I had to be careful with it, it felt like a slippery slope with my recovery.  I started using it more frequently.  I started to really like the combination of girlfriend and kratom hangouts.  Felt similar to my heroin days of getting high and cuddling with my ex.  Fast forward to now, I’ve been off and on.  Typically for a month I’ll be using every day at about 20 gpd, and then quit for a couple weeks.  It’s fucked with me so bad.  I kept telling myself I didn’t relapse and that I had 9 years still but I just can’t live with that dishonesty towards myself anymore.  Life feels so heavy right now.  I don’t work out anymore, I’m always dizzy, I’m super reclusive and I just generally feel so lost.  Which is all a sharp contrast from who I used to be.  I was the poster boy of sobriety, speaking at treatment centers, helping others etc.  I keep justifying to myself that I’m in a new chapter in life and ready to not be the outgoing person I once was and that the kratom doesn’t have a lot to do with it.  But that’s just not true.  It’s dimming my soul.  But I’m scared to quit.  And I can’t put my finger on why.  It’s not the withdraws, which won’t even be that bad, especially compared to heroin withdrawals.  I think what it is, is the classic attribute of addiction.  These substances become like baby blankets for us in such an overwhelming world.  They truly rewire our brains with continued use.  At my core I have the belief that I’m not going to be safe or ok without it?  My higher self knows that’s not true but it’s still a battle.  I plan to practice what I’ve preached to the hundreds of people I’ve helped over the years, ONE DAY AT A TIME.  There’s no more room for me to have a healthy relationship with substances.  Sobriety is the only path for a guy like me.  Thank you for reading.  Much love everyone! Keep up the good fight!  Oh and can someone DM me any online kratom support meetings?",14

I was on 50 to 80gpd for 2.5 years.   
I had a full blood panel work up done.  Thank god nothing out of ordinary. I am really happy and suprised about that

Day 1 tomorrow.,"I was tapering fairly successfully after my 5+ year long 60+ gpd habit for about a month and a half, got down to 4g a day and was feeling great, far better than when I was on a heavier dose. Then my relationship fell apart and I did what I always do when experiencing relationship stress, take more. Been doing about 7-10g for the past week, so not terrible, but I can just feel it that my mindset is not strong enough for controlled use right now, because of how sad I am. I still WANT to quit so bad, I was so happy at 4 g, I could taste the freedom, but the emotional pain and desire to numb makes it compulsive if I have it around. So I decided to toss the stash. Threw it away at a Fred Meyer so I can't go dig through my garbage in the morning when I want it. 

I really hope that a week at this higher dose didn't erase all of the progress I made, as I can't afford multiple weeks of debilitating brain fog and terrible sleep and restlessness and inability to focus with all that I've got going on right now, finishing my bachelor's and applying for graduate programs. Does anyone know from experience if it will have? 

I was also really surprised by how quickly increasing the dose made me need it more frequently to not get restless, or the cold sweats. Definitely motivating to cut it out again. I know those are withdrawal symptoms, so I'm feeling like this may be rough, but I'm cautiously optimistic that they won't last as long. I've had TERRIBLE withdrawals with previous CT quits. The combination of my vision getting wonky and all the other psychological and physiological symptoms genuinely made me feel crazy. I need some encouragement :(",1

Started on about <2 g taken as 500mg x 3-4 a day for executive function disorder and Pain. It worked amazing. No side effects or jitters or hangover effect. Fast forward to last week and I realize I'm at about 15-20 grams a day. 

I ran out the night before work, and on the way to work the other day I just told myself I would grab some after my shift. But a couple hours into my shift, *intense* withdrawals started kicking in. I couldn't believe it, just about 12 hours without a dose and I was withdrawling bad. 

I am physically addicted to this stuff. I am on day 1 of no kratom and going through all the withdrawal symptoms. 

Thinking back I have had a host of medical problems over the past year that may or may not have to do with kratom - including muscle convulsions: abdomen, legs, arms - like a seizure almost - and intestinal problems I have never had before. That's something anecdotal but mentioning it to see if it improves. 

I noticed today the withdrawal symptoms lessen when I get up and do something (which is not easy), and get worse when I sit still. Just food for thought.

So here I go. Into the suck. I'm just really glad I found this place and have enjoyed reading all of your posts and the FAQ's. Good luck everyone. Be well.

As many of you know I had 70 days clean CT and relapsed back to extract twice a day for about three months. With my new big girl career I wasn’t able to quit cold turkey this time as I didn’t have time to take off work. So instead I decided to do a rapid 7 day suboxone taper to help kick the kratom withdrawls without feeling withdrawl and today is my first day no suboxone so day 8 of clean from kratom but now I’m feeling the PAWS and can’t tell if I’m going to have brutal suboxone withdrawls or not. I go back to work Tuesday and I can’t feel like garbage at the job I do. I help perform surgery, etc so I have to be extremely alert and I’m so so scared. will I be ok or am I going to experience sun withdrawls after only taking them 7 days. My taper from the subs looked like this. Day 1&2 8mg day 3&4 6 mg day 5&6 4 mg and day 7 2mg. Wondering if I should take one mg today or just jump from here. Please help. I never took subs before but was told it would help me come off kratom super fast. I’ve tried tapering kratom over a month and it never worked I didn’t have the discipline to taper kratom. That’s why my only option was to do CT But take suboxone for seven days to get through the majority of the bad kratom withdraws

EDIT UPDATE :
I’m feeling the withdrawls. I fucked up. Whatever made me think a rapid taper of suboxone would get me thru kratom WD I was playing with fire. Now I feel I won’t be able to get off suboxone without using kratom to help. It never ends. I’ve got two 8mg strips left. Two days ago I jumped from 1mg after a week and my withdrawls were to much I took .5 mg to help ease it. Im planning to skip a few days again until I feel horrible and take .25 and then hoping to jump from there. Any advice helps to help me come off these subs without having to get more.  Can make 2 8mg strips last a while since I cut them into .25 peices I just don’t know how to do it",8

I have been using 30-45 gpd for the past 6 months. I also had a 5 week period of using 60-80 gpd in 2020. I CT'd the first time and experienced the worst possible acutes (the RLS was a beast unlike anything I've ever experienced. It was so severe I thought I was going to have to amputate my legs). 

That may be a bit overdramatic, but it was the worst I have ever felt, and I was a long time opioid user in the past and went through those withdrawals. In my experience, kratom withdrawals are way worse than opioid withdrawals, just my opinion.

Fast forward to today, now at 48 hours CT. this time withdrawals are so different and mild I am completely mindblown. Out of the last 48 hours, I have slept a minimum of 20. I was worried about the RLS again, but I have only had a brief, hour long episode last night that was manageable. My worst symptom has been body aches and exhaustion. Some chills and runny nose, but relatively mild so far. 

I am so confused. This time, despite only using half the amount I did last year, I have been using 6x longer. Now I know I am in the very early stages, but I was expecting a lot worse by now. Potentially this time is different bc I have much more potent helper meds than last time (high-ish dose gabapentin prescription, delta 8 & 10 vape & flower, high dose vitamin c, compared to essentially nothing last time). 

I'm sure the worst is yet to come, and I am still expecting it. I fully understand I'm nowhere near out of the woods yet, but I honestly figured by 48 hours, I would start being in the worst of it, but so far I am baffled. Sorry for the long post, but anyone else have a similar experience? 

If you made it this far in the post, thank you for reading. I wish you all nothing but peace and love.

If you guys could throw some encouragement my way  (DM or maybe just responding to this thread) Monday morning that would be very much appreciated.

I hate to come across as “needy” but I’ve accepted I can’t do this alone. I’m simply not going to be able to rely on myself Monday morning. 

If I can just make it through Monday, I guarantee you I’ll make it for good.

Thanks and have a great weekend everyone!",13

I cried in shame but they've been so supportive. I originally was getting mental help for depression and anixety.
It feels so good to finally open up and not hold the secret anymore. I need the accountability and support. I've been on 42 GPD for chronic pain. I'm tapering and on day 3. My appt just ended with my psychiatrist and he just prescribed me clonidine so I will start that soon. He also is changing my depression/anxiety meds from Zoloft to Cymbalta  as he thinks it will help more in my situation and helps with chronic pain.
Also my psychologist said I should have compassion for myself and it's understandable how I became dependent.
Did you have any support from mental health professionals? I realize not everyone has access but if you are able it could help.
 I'm optimistic now and also wanted to pass along the message to have compassion for yourself. We all have a reason we use.

2021-11-12 15:23:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/qsjyrd/progress/,Progress...,"Today is Day #9! Wishing it could be day 13, as i quit on Oct 30th but took one small dose on Nov 3, about 10% of what my daily intake has been.  Honestly don't regret taking it, but I also would definitely not recommend doing that.  It did help me sleep, which i had not gotten any during the first 3 nights.  Slept 5 hours after dosing, and that felt good, but i woke up with withdrawals coming back on and the craving to take more was even worse than before.  Good thing that was the last of it.

Here i am now, on day 9.  I don't think the dose really affected my w/d progress other than for maybe 8 hours, so it maybe set me back that far in terms of physical w/d. Anyways, during the first 7 days, i didn't sleep at all other than after that dose.  It was quite possibly the worst week of my life.  I really didn't think i could do it.  Then, finally, i fell asleep on night #8 and woke up feeling.. okay? idk, not good but definitely a little better.  Well things keep getting better a little bit at a time.  The last two days i felt very positive about things, honestly think i was in a pink cloud for 36-48 hours.  Woke up this morning back to reality a bit.  Things are more boring, i'm anxious, i don't want to do much, but i do feel so much better than the first week that deep down i do want to do stuff.  It feels so amazing to leave my house with a bag of powder and a spoon in my back pocket.  Like seriously, it actually feels like FREEDOM.  Don't get it wrong, I know there will be a long road ahead.  There will be good days and bad days, but i am still just so happy, that after 4 years of abusing K, i finally feel like there's hope for life without it.  I spent the last 2.5 years wanting to quit, trying to taper, doing anything i could.  But realistically i didn't do everything.  The last step was me coming clean to my parents and asking for help.  I told myself for a long time that i didn't come clean because of shame, but ive realized that that's bullshit, and i was not ready.  Well, this time i was definitely ready.  I made sure that this was what I WANTED.  And i did want it.  If i didn't have accountability from my parents or this reddit page, I would still be lost.  THERE IS HOPE! And this is coming from someone who hated themselves for the past few years, and someone who thought life would be impossible without K.  It may be tough, but it's doable, and you can be happy too.  I can see the light in the distance!",12

I think I'm finally ready to quit.,"I take more kratom than anyone should, about 20-30g/dose, 3x a day, but I'm tapering down after the last incident. I'm currently at 15g 2x a day. I've been on it for 6 years, except for a 32 day period when I was in rehab. 

What happened is I took the normal dose and you know those kratom spins and shakes you get when you take too much? Those were multiplied by 100 and I started shaking, stuttering and getting dizzy. The first time I was at work and was suddenly stumbling around which caught my coworkers' attention and they made me sit down and called an Uber to take me to the hospital. At the time I didn't think it was kratom related and I was really scared

The second time I had gotten home from work and took a larger dose than normal (instead of the usual 24g I took 30g and vomited. I started walking upstairs to get a trash bag and suddenly collapsed on the stairs thinking I was having a seizure. My vision was extremely wobbly, I kept trying to stand up which caused me to fall back down and hit my head on the stairs and wall and chipped a tooth. I tried crawling back to bed and hit my head on the floor falling off the bed. I tried to take some cbd oil and spilled it everywhere. I couldn't even lift my legs or arms up for 2 hours, and it was another hour until I could stand up. It was terrifying. I had carpet burn and bruises all over my body for days and my dad saw it happen and thought I was overdosing or having a seuzure. 

This last time I was at work and took the usual dose, the same amount I took that morning with no problem. In only 20 minutes I was super dizzy, 20 minutes later my head was shaking so bad I couldn't lift it off the wall, and realized I couldn't stand up I was shaking so bad. I was in my chair laying back and every time I moved my arm it fell back down and I was sitting there terrified that everyone at work would see and call an ambulance. People started noticing and I finally said I was having a panic attack and asked to be allowed to sit and calm down. I was stuck in the chair for an hour before I could get up and was exhausted, dizzy and scared the rest of the day.

After this last incident I realized it was caused by kratom and I've been lowering my dose to the lowest level possible that won't cause withdrawal.

Anyone else have this happen? I know I'm taking huge doses but every time it's happened it's been the same dose I usually take, if not a tiny bit more. Maybe it has something to do with kratom being a diuretic and causing a drop in electrolytes or blood sugar or something.

Regardless, it's terrifying to me and I think I'm finally ready to taper off and be done with this shit. I'm a recovering opiate, benzo, alcohol, cocaine and amphetamine addict and I finally realized I'm not truly sober. I work in a rehab and am starting to feel like a fraud giving clients advice and claiming clean time while being addicted to drinking 3 ounces of putrid opioid sludge every day to stay well. No matter how much I eat I can't get past 114 pounds, I'm losing hair at 26, my skin is pale and I feel constantly tired, dizzy and emotionless. I throw up sporadically at least once a week and am constantly nauseous. I just feel gross. I've lost interest in things like art, love and friendship and sleep 12 hours a day. I never thought kratom could damage my health so much and I feel so stuck.

16 months ago I went to rehab to get off benzos and kratom and felt amazing after the withdrawal ended. I gained 25 pounds, regained interest in life and felt so good. I started taking kratom again the day I got home from rehab and tried to only take it sparingly. Obviously it didn't work and within a month or two I went from 6gpd to my old dose of 90gpd. I got skinny again, started sleeping all the time, and felt like a piece of shit when my family and friends would tell me how happy they am that I'm sober. And when I started working at a rehab I felt like an even bigger piece of shit bringing a thermos full of kratom to work and drinking it in the bathroom. I'd go back to treatment to get off it but I'd lose my job which I love so so much. 

I know this was a long post but I had to put it out there and vent. Thanks for reading. I'll update as I continue to taper. Also i have hepatitis c which may contribute to some of the things I mentioned. I'm happy to say I started my medication for it today and within 3 months I'll be hep free",20

I've been a long time user on a smaller dose, but I've been feeling the withdrawals. Day 2 seemed to be the worst of it--intense nausea, almost a mild cold (tons of mucus in the throat), a bunch of awful bathroom trips.

Day 3 though? I'm feeling fantastic. It's like I passed the hill and I'm speeding down at 900mph.

Today, I legitimately have an appetite. I haven't had an appetite in many, many months. I want to cry I'm so happy. Food tastes good!

Anyone on the fence about quitting with prolonged gastro issues should really look at kratom. My doctors had no idea what was going on, and this is encouraging. I'll continue to report my progress!",8

Been browsing this board for a while, and just wanted to share my story, hopefully as a bit of accountability to myself. Sorry for the potential length. :) I've been using kratom for around 5 years at varying amounts. When I first started, I was taking it for my RLS. Stuff does wonders for it honestly, and I hadn't had any kind of RLS while on kratom for years. Initially I was just taking it before bed at night, and it was great. Somewhere along the way I decided to start taking it during the day just to help me relax more. In hindsight, that was a terrible decision and something I've come to regret.

&#x200B;

For the past few years, I've been at somewhere between 15-20 GPD, no breaks. The kratom never really made me feel negatively, but at the same time I feel like I was taking it for no reason. It got to a point where I was taking small doses every 2-3 hours, and I'd sit at my computer watching the clock for when my next dose would be coming up. I felt normal this entire time, but it just seemed unnecessary.

&#x200B;

Around 2.5 weeks ago, I noticed I started getting random spasms and twitches throughout my body. None of them very big or constant, but it was happening enough where I was concerned. After reviewing my diet/supplements/recent changes, etc., I thought the only thing that might be causing them is the kratom. After doing some searching, I saw other people had developed similar symptoms from kratom, so I decided to reduce my overall dosage with the intent to quit entirely. 

&#x200B;

At the time I was at probably 18-20 GPD, and because I felt like I was taking kratom for no reason most of the time, I decided to cut that intake by over half. I still felt fine and my RLS stuff was still gone, so I figured I was good. Turns out, not so much. A couple days into this, I developed this massive headache, had problems with digestion and diarrhea, my appetite tanked and I had constant nausea. I didn't make the connection it was the reduction of kratom causing these problems at the time, though I had considered it.

&#x200B;

A few days after getting sick like this, I had a panic attack. This is something I've never had in my life and I had no idea what was happening. Two days later, panic attack number two. This was Wednesday night, and because I had 2 of them in a short timeframe, I took myself into the ER. I thought something was potentially wrong with my heart, so I wanted to play it safe. While at the ER, the doc in the building had asked if I was taking anything, and I told him about the kratom for my RLS. He asked if I had changed my intake at all recently, which is when he said he thought all my symptoms were withdrawal, including the panic attacks. After getting home from the ER that night, I decided I couldn't take any more kratom.

&#x200B;

Before going to the ER with panic attack #2, my last dose of kratom had been at 9PM that night. Two hours later is when the panic attack happened and I took myself in. Yesterday (Thursday), I felt OK all day, until around 5-6PM when my RLS kicked back in. I dealt with it for a while, but the longer the night went on, the more insane the RLS became. I've never experienced it so bad in all my life. It started in my legs but then eventually spread up to my upper back and was hitting my arms. I legitimately couldn't lay down or sit down or be still for more than 2 seconds. I tried as much as I could to just deal with it, but at around 3:30AM I gave up and took a small dose of kratom to get rid of it. The kratom worked and the RLS went away after about 30 minutes, and I was able to sleep for a bit. Then at 5:30 this morning...panic attack #3.

&#x200B;

So now it's 6:30AM and I'm still a bit jittery from the last attack, but I know now I absolutely can't take any more kratom, it's fucking me up too much. My real worry is the RLS, I don't think I can handle how bad it was if that happens again. I have an appointment with my doctor on Tuesday, but that's a long way away. In hindsight I should've tapered off better, but I can't really go back now since it would mean going back up to 20 GPD again, and I have no idea how my body would even react to that. It seems like kratom is triggering these panic attacks even at low doses now, so I just need to quit.

&#x200B;

Hopefully the RLS can be managed once it kicks in again, but I'm pretty worried about it. I guess we'll have to see what happens, but the dose I took earlier this morning needs to be my last.",22

I stranded myself here with no way out for this reason. I'm going nuts in withdrawal. My story is pretty fucked- and I dont blame kratom entirely but the way I used it (to mask and medicate other addictions) was recipe for absolute trainwrecks. I can't think right on the stuff. I lose all motivation. I can't fuck my girlfriends right. I can't find any energy to maintain a clean and healthy life routine or exercise or do anything really- and it sucks the money right out of my bank account. 

I lost my family and thousands of dollars- fucked up university in a field which was my dream- sure I could blame kratom but there were other factors as well. Kraton always seems to lead back to alcohol and harder shit to which I have no defense. I feel shitty going to 12 step meetings on the stuff. I've messed up so much.. its sad. I wish I could turn back time but I just can't.

So here I am again. Day 2. Can barely sleep- am tossing and turning and soaking the bed sheets. I am thinking of getting on suboxone. Maybe extreme yeah, but thats just how awful I feel rn and life looks bleak. I can't talk to my daughter either. I'm feeling hopeless. 

Any thoughts or advice appreciated",16

I have a problem.  I take 2-3 OPMS Black shots, (which are stronger than Gold), at a time.  I call this a ""session"".  I have a session once every 48-72 hours and I can not break this habit.  Once I'm over being pumped up about quitting, the temptation of a heavy OPMS high seduced me, usually I feel  sick or disgusted with myself within an hour or two of taking it.

I used to be a daily Kratom user, then quit for a couple years.  Once CT from dosing 20-30 grams per day of plain leaf (never again), and another time I quit gradually via a slow taper.

This current addiction I have to shots is psychologically hell.  I am ashamed to not know how many times I have told myself ""last one, last session"" only to find myself at the smoke shop right as withdrawals from the massive dose finally begin to get a little better.

I take these 48-72 hour ""breaks"" so that I won't become ""addicted"".  Truth is I am, because I can't seem to stop.  I find myself swearing that I don't want to anymore, reminding myself how my life would be better if this crap didn't exist, and looking forward to the day this drug isn't dominating my mind.  

The physical withdrawals are unpleasant but bearable, I make sure to take at the very least 36 hours between sessions, even then I of course still notice withdrawals.  Many would say I'm circling the drain and daily use is inevitable, but this pattern began at the start of the pandemic when my stress and depression spiked and now I can't break this ridiculous loop I've found myself in.

My current plan is to have Sunday be my last session, because a Sunday without OPMS and football seems unbearable at this time.

I'm reaching out for any support someone can offer.  Maybe there's someone else caught in a ridiculous cycle similar to mine, but I haven't found any in other posts.

For anyone who takes the time to read this, THANK YOU.  Perhaps we can help each other get over the hump.  Thanks again.

TLDR:. I'm addicted to taking 2-3 OPMS shots in one setting once every 2-3 days and I can't quit, please help.",15

I know people recommend going for walks and being out in the sun, which did feel good for a little while. After being out most of the morning I was getting a headache and felt bad. I went back home, ate a big meal, and crashed out for 3 hours in the afternoon. I woke up feeling minor withdrawals, probably similar to how I would have felt before when waking up after not dosing for 10 hours. So much better than the wd I felt while tapering and the first 2 days of CT! It strangely feels great even though I am totally still in withdrawal, just not nearly as bad as before.

Feeling anxious and sweating a ton. I don’t want to turn on my a/c because I can tell it’s really not that hot. Drinking a ton of water. I eased up on the vitamins but still took ibuprofen for a minor headache and some Vit C. I will take magnesium before bed.

I just did some light weight full body circuit exercises and yoga. It made my heart rate feel uncomfortably high after the weights, but then I felt good during yoga. I still feel anxious and am prepared for another really bad night of RSL but I shouldn’t need to do much tomorrow. I might try to go to the gym and lift heavier weights tomorrow and see if I can wear out my legs. I ran stairs earlier and they feel like they should be worn out after all the squats and lunges, but I’m already feeling like I need to move them again. I changed out my yoga mat to a clean one figuring I will likely need to do some poses during the night.

TL/DR: Day 3 withdrawals feel like ""normal"" daily withdrawals I used to feel when taking my daily doses if I went without dosing for a while. Feels so much better than the wd during tapering and Days 1-2 CT, so I'm feeling pretty good about it. Ready for another bad night since I still feel very anxious and am sweating profusely.",4

Honestly after a few months I lost all the cravings for the drug. I was taking around 12-15 GPD everyday for at least a year. The withdrawals were fucked, couldn't sleep at all for like a week or two. When I discovered Kratom, I thought it was a miracle drug with no side affects or potential for addiction. How wrong I was. I wish I could say my life is great today, but as an addict I've dealt with alcoholism for the past few years and am recently sober from that. But, I will say that not having to take a shit ton of capsules every 4-6 hours of every single day just to function is a huge relief. My one question is, will my hair ever come back? I'm only 25 and now have super thin hair. Prior to Kratom I had thick fast growing hair. Now it takes forever for me to grow hair. Idk, maybe my hair problem isn't Kratom related? Anybody else been off Kratom for this long and not noticed hair growth. One of the motivating factors that made me quit was my hair. Anyways, just wanted to say that if my fucked up addictive personality self can stop Kratom, so can you! PS, it's way easier to quit the sooner you do it.",16

I was shoveling down 2-3 heaping tablespoons down my throat multiple times a day. I was taking it,  like so many of us, for a boost. I thought it was helping me focus. Haha!!! And we all know what happens...In the end of my use I was a shell of myself. I was suicidal,  felt and looked terrible,  was going into withdrawal if I didn't dose...I'd wake up and immediately dose because I  woke up feeling like shit. I jumped without any help or knowing what  I was in for. I vomited for 4 days, body temperature swings were constant for a long time.  My husband  and son had no clue what was going on. I finally  told them somewhere in the 1st week.  They were about to force me to go to the er. (In hindsight ...might have been  a good idea) 

One of the most important  things I've learned here is that everyone has their own timeline.  I'm so happy for the people  who are posting they feel back to 100% after 45 days (or whatever that number may be) but it's also frustrating  knowing that I'm not going to have some magic number where I wake up and be perfect.  I'm trying to find joy and happiness  in the small things. I'm working  on myself. I'm seeing mental and physical  therapists. PAWS is exhausting but I'm improving and it's small steps. Anxiety is very present.  

Physically,  I still have issues with food. I have only had a handful of  solid 💩. Certain  foods smell, and taste like chemicals. My hair is filling back in and seems less brittle. I can see better. I'm not getting light headed.  

This sub has so much support  and has helped me so much. It's utterly astounding how much is not known about kratom. There is more knowledge  here than on any website! If the only way out is through... I guess we are all in this together 💚",36

So last night didn’t sleep didn’t expect too and had RLS but it wasn’t just my legs it was every single part of my body. My arms..my fingers. I had to constantly move everything. Constantly. If I just laid there and fought it my body would suddenly become taken over in excruciating pain. Until I moved around. Is this normal to have full body aches and need to move constantly?

On Tuesday I started getting rls about two hours after taking my last dose. Now no matter how much I take I am feeling withdrawal effect within an hour or two of last dose. I either have the chills or sweating I have no energy and no appetite. Not sure why all the sudden after 3 or 4 years it would start doing this. I could go 7 or 8 hours before I felt any symptoms normally. Now that I have to take it every two hours to get rid of symptoms I feel it is best to quit. Not sure what the best route is but I just ordered voacatox and buffered vitamin c.. hoping it helps with rls that is what bothers me most.,13

It was such a wonderful replacement for alcohol. I really liked how it made me talkative with my wife after coming home from work…which she loved! 

I took 4 grams once a day from Friday through Monday. Everything seemed better. I could even go shopping with my wife and not be tired! I noticed every once in a while I would get easily irritated. I called this the Kratom clap. I think it was because I felt so comfortable that anything that would try to interrupt that comfort kinda pissed me off. 

After learning more about Kratom, I realized I could drop my dose to about 3 grams a day, rotate my strains, and feel something almost every time. I brought my wife in to enjoy the experience. At first I had her try it so she could cope with family events. She loved how it made her peaceful and happy. She started taking it everyday (something I thought I would never do!). We both justified it since we felt it was much better than consuming alcohol on a regular basis. I eventually started taking it every day over 2 years ago. She started taking small amounts throughout the day. I started taking it twice a day last year and then really loved taking a third dose a couple of hours before bedtime. 

Then I began to think about my life. I knew it wasn’t good to be hooked on something for the rest of my life. After some self reflection and  hearing a podcast on addiction, I knew I needed to quit…at least for a month and evaluate from there. 

Why quit? I was becoming a weak, irritated zombie with no drive in life. I was becoming content with doing nothing. I was fooled into thinking Kratom made me stronger and better. My wife and I both noticed a difference in each other and it wasn’t good. I started reading this forum and was encouraged by all the testimonies of finding clarity! 

Last month I switched to stem and vein and tapered from there. It was crazy to see how much my body wanted and felt relief with only .50 grams of stem and vein! 

I am now on 1 week of being completely clean. I have already experienced bouts of good clean energy. I know have a bad cold. It’s weird. I never had a cold when I was on K and now that I quit, I have one. Oh well. I’m climbing out of the hole and feeling better. My wife is on day 2 and not doing so well. Fortunately we can help each other through this!  

To all those struggling today, it will get better! I’m thankful for this community and for those who have posted. It certainly helps in getting through the tough days!",11

I've felt truly and successfully quit for a long time now, but thought I'd check in just to motivate those of you that are having trouble. I wanted to quit for more than 2 years before I successfully did. Now it seems like that was a different person. 

Things absolutely suck at first, and they do absolutely get better. For me, it was about 4 months clean after a 4.5 year habit before I really felt properly good, but after about a month I already felt loads better than on kratom.

My physical and mental health are so so so much better I can't even describe it fully. I've lost 30 pounds. I'm relatively happy after contemplating suicide towards the end of my kratom use. I've been back at the work I thought I couldn't do without kratom for 3 months and I'm performing much better, and have energy at the end of the day. I exercise regularly. I haven't drank in almost 4 months.

I did 14 weeks of CBT and I've been on Cipralex 10mg for 7 months. However, I pursued this after being off kratom for about 5 months. Couldn't recommend professional mental health support enough. So much better than self medicating. 

It wasn't easy to quit. Physically I did a long (~2 month) taper from 15gpd down to 750mg before jumping. I have done a ton of work changing my habits and it was pretty uncomfortable for the first while. What kept me going was knowing that kratom wasn't working anymore. I had to find something else that did. 

Good luck to all of you fighting. Once you've decided the drug isn't helping you anymore, you'll find a way to move on.",54

Today is the first day I feel not so bad. Just a little anxiety. It sucks that I have to work through this at a desk job. If I were to do this over again I probably would have chose time off and walked all day long. Even though my energy is up and down I feel exercise helps a lot. 

I plan to cut down .5G/ day. I go as long as I can stand w/o dosing and stick to the intended amount.

If been using kratom since about 4 years but most of the time it was just one of many drugs I took when the time was right.
I’ve always been interested in pharmacology and all things “mind altering” and saw myself as pretty informed.

About when covid hit, I had a pretty rough time staying motivated with my studies and over the next few months my long term relationship started to fall apart too…

I turned to alcohol which is abundant and pretty normalised in the country/culture I’m in, but knew it destroyed me.

When I was not drinking I would take Kratom which I realised would allow me to still be more or less productive and do „mentally challenging“ things. 

Fast forward to about one year ago, and I was taking Kratom pretty much every day.

I soon realised that I kinda lost my happy attitude which I loved about myself. I also lost my drive to do things that I would normally enjoy, especially on a social level.

But I allways thought to myself „hey, at least you do something don’t you? You might not be happy about anything you do, but at least everything feels kind of ok and bearable!“

A few months ago, I started to take it more than once a day…
And I lost all motivation to do pretty much anything if I hadn’t taken the right amount at the right time before.

So many fucking things went through my head why live was the way it is for such a long time. Why didn’t i feel real joy anymore? Why was I so apathetic?

It took me way to long to figure out what it was, even though I think in the back of my brain I always knew.

Currently on day 2 CT.

Thank you all so much for making me realise so many things!

Fuck it, we got this!
Fuck relying on some nasty mudwater to be able to motivate oneself to do something!
Fuck everything feeling „okay“ instead of good or bad!",23

RLS is my worst lingering symptom normally. 

Alright so I may have just completely fucked my brain chemistry or it could be a supplement I was taking but I haven’t had RLS the last few nights. I have gotten 6-7 hours each night of sleep. 

I started taking a supplement called Mucuna puriens which is converted into dopamine.  
I’ve done a lot of research on RLS in the passed and what most of us are experiencing in WDs is actually drug induced RLS. In which the dopamine channels are all fucked up. It may be the mucuna puriens or my brain chemistry is full on fucked. 
I have been binge eating sugar before bed and I wake up in a puddle of sweat each night. Hopefully that’s me detoxing

I am feeling weird/dizzy right now and tired and I'm not through day 1 yet. As a passenger in the car I felt like my stomach tickled and like I was on an amusement park ride with my perception messed up. Is this normal?

I have been using about 42g per day spaced out over over 6 doses a day (1 tbsp or 7g per dose). I upped my use to daily a year and a half ago when I had a fall and injured my back. I also struggle with severe neck pain. I dont know how I'm going to live with the pain which doesnt even completely go away with kratom. Before my habit became daily (after my fall) I would take only 1 to 2 x per week when my neck was really bad. I'm mad at myself that I've become physically dependent. Withdrawals scare me so that's why I'm tapering. 

I started having chest pain a few days ago and at times my heart rate gets low. It really freaked me out. I almost went to the ER today. I think it may be mostly from stress though as it eased up. I also have thinning hair (I'm female) and stomach issues. I have depression as well even before kratom.

I started off small, maybe 2g after work. I was working from home so it became easier to start my first dose earlier and earlier in the day. I started taking 1g doses starting first thing in the morning, then throughout the day. My last dose would be before dinner, so by the time I woke up the next morning I would be feeling withdrawals.

I realized a while ago that I was physically addicted and using it as stress relief. First steps were to keep track of how much I was typically taking, about 10 gpd, although I know it would be more if the day was stressful. 

Once I figured how much I was averaging I tried to taper down 1-2g every few days. I did this for a few weeks but felt terrible the whole time and ended up going back up whenever I needed to be functional. 

Now that lockdown restrictions have eased, social gatherings made me want to quit for good. I tapered hard starting two weeks before having to meet friends for lunch. I tapered down to 2g a day for a few days but felt really bad on those days. I didn’t make it to being clean – I ended up taking 6g that day to avoid feeling like shit while being with my friends.  

After that day I decided to just jump off. So I’m on day 2 of complete CT.  

Have been in bed a lot but not sleeping well at all. Most of the time was spent trying to focus breathe to try to keep the RLS under control, but it hasn’t really worked. I kept having to get up and do body squats or jump around. I think I was in bed for 10 hours for the first two nights but the RLS was so bad I was in a state of half sleep most of the time.

I have been eating more although I feel a little nauseous and can’t eat a lot. Been taking magnesium, multi-vitamin, vit c, and ibuprofen.  

I anticipate it being bad for the next few days but hoping to see some light by next week. 

**TL/DR:** Was taking about 10 gpb in 1-2g doses from morning to evening for about 18 months. Second attempt at tapering, now in Day 2 of CT, feel like shit but pushing through it.",4

I’ve quit Oxy, suboxen and kratom multiple times in the past. I got through those very hard years in my 20’s and had quit for a number of years. At 32, I decided I wanted to pursue more schooling and ‘make something out of myself’ so I applied to graduate school. I got in. While I was in graduate school however, I picked up a kratom habit (again), after getting through so much before going back to school. I was so disappointed in myself but it was the only way I knew how to get through the stress of demanding academic deadlines and tests. Fast forward almost two year and I finally am quitting again after taking huge spoonful doses about 4-5 times a day. I got a job as an auditor at a casino and worked for about a year after graduating until I got an opportunity to work for the state as an auditor.  Well that didn’t work out as it was all remote and I just couldn’t keep up with the work, especially when factoring in the kratom use. My short term memory is shit and I was having trouble concentrating. So I quit the job with no financial plan to get by.  So I decided I finally wanted to be free of the addiction, so while simultaneously stressing about needing to find a job, I am starting day one of withdrawal. I gathered all the half empty bags of kratom I had left and threw them (literally) to the wind in a dramatic act of empowerment and self reclamation.  I’m supposed to be looking for a job but fear the next week will be hard to get through on its own without having to worry about money.  I have a great group of supportive friends and thought posting here might expand my support system further.  Any advice on how to deal is welcome. I just wanted to write where I’m at and how I got here down and share. Thank you if your read this far. Wish me luck!",3

I am a 38y female and four years Ago I use kratom to get off a tramadol addiction. I like some of you didn’t think the substance was bad. It helped get me off tramadol but turned into a 4yr addiction about 8-10gpd habit. This past year I was afflicted with the worse health problems and was wondering if anyone else had these issues. My extremities would go numb and weak throughout the day. Extreme light headedness we’re I thought I was going to pass out. Hair loss major stomach pain at night, night sweats, my vision got worst and major brain fog. I for sure thought I have a serious disease but all the tests came back normal. I am still schedule to have an mri just to be safe but wondering if anyone else had these symptoms. This stuff made me feel like I was carrying a hundred lbs extra in between doses even though I only weighed 105lbs. Most symptoms have gotten better still struggle with fatigue. I got black seed oil, agmatine, and l-tyrosine to help with fatigue. How do u use the black seed oil just a tsp a day and what did it do for you, other then hair skin nail benefits. This drug has been the death of all things I had to take FMLA from my job in healthcare goin now on over 2 months. I feel aweful for those of you working through all this and am cheering you all on!",9

Kratom made me lose all interesting in dating and sex. I’d be around girls I KNOW are very attractive but have no primal urge at all. I definitely want to reconnect with my sexuality and male hood.

I want to have energy to get out of bed, shower, make breakfast, and not have to dose to get that done. 

I love the gym. I’ve totally lost the energy and will to go anymore. 

I want to enjoy food again. I don’t know about you, but I have an extremely dysfunctional starve and binge cycle going with junk food. It’s got to stop.

So I quit Kratom cold turkey, along with that I quit all my medications and quit video games.

I just kept doing more because I couldn't feel it. At my most I was taking on average 25 grams but sometimes as much as 35 grams a dose 3 times a day. And I would barley feel it. The Kratom was however giving me constant anxiety. Like insane shit had a fear I was going to choke on my food and made it extremely hard to eat. Had a fear I was going to swallow my tongue.  I legit lost weight because of that shit. Decided I was done with it and started tapering. Even though it's so much work decided to make up thousands of capsules and take one capsule away each day. Started my taper at like 18 grams when I got down to like 13 I started feeling irritable and felt like I was sick. I'm now at 11 grams and it's weird I feel 100 percent fine now and even feeling good when I dose even though I felt nothing taking 18 grams. I guess my body has just adjusted to the lower amounts. I also at this level have beat that crazy mental health stuff no more fear of choking. I wonder why high doses can mess you up like that. It wasn't just after I took it either. It was constant irrational anxiety. I know it's going to get harder as I go down. But I'm feeling good now. My taper is subtracting .66 grams a day. I'm hoping I don't get sick at all going down this slow.,3

I have like everyone else I'm sure, this dark fuck it al voice in my head and this happy go lucky optimistic let's fn do this thing voice as well. The back and forth is driving me mad. I don't know how to handle this anymore. 

I use 2-3 days (not much, maybe 8ish grams) in a row, then the most I make it off is 2 days.. the highs and lows are driving me to madness, but even sometimes when I feel good on day 2 since it's not too much usage I still say fuck it and that's where I mess up. When I feel bad it's easier to give in. 

I was using 50gpd back in 2019, and slowed that usage down, but never actually stopped. Now I just leave myself on this roller coaster of stopping every few days and feeling horrible  just to drink it again to feel horrible again in another 2-3 days. 

I'm stuck on this roller coaster. I don't buy powder or caps or anything - I buy already made kratom leaf drinks from the many many local Kava bars here in South FL so there really isn't any kind of taper I think I can do.

I know we talk about hair loss a lot here, and really it sounds like all we have are anecdotal stories- but it’s clear that hair loss has occurred for a lot of us.

I have gotten a little obsessive over the hair on my head the past few weeks and went down a rabbit hole comparing photos from years ago to now. It’s interesting because I was a daily, low dose user for 3 years and my dose got even lower in the last year, but I noticed the hair loss just over the past 4-5 months or so.

For those of you who lost hair, at what point in your use did it happen? Does it come and go in cycles (since there are natural cycles)? Did it happen immediately when you started, when you increased your dose? Or just gradual? Any thoughts would be appreciated.

I am using rogaine and rosemary oil, but I’m sure the cessation of taking kratom will help the most. I’m 25F and I still have a decent amount of hair but I can tell a difference. I feel like the more I think about it, the worse it gets. :(",6

It worked well for me. I quit eventually and was free of Kratom for about 2 years. I started again for about a year then tapered off. I had a major surgery and was on pain pills for about 3 weeks. I didn’t abuse them but when they were gone I felt like crap. It didn’t really start physical WD but it did the mental part. I started Kratom again! I’ve been doing it daily since the end of April. I want off this crap! I’m starting a taper again. I’m using today to find out how much I’m actually taking and I’ll go from there. I use capsules and if I had to guess I prob take about 10/12 capsules a day which would be 5/6 grams. I know it’s not a huge amount but I hand to stay functional as I have 5 kids and have to keep my household running. I do have the willpower to taper and that’s the route I’m going to go again. I did CT my first off of 60+ grams and that was a horrible nightmare! Just posting because it’s good for me to put it in writing I’m doing this again! My hair is so gross and stringy, my skin looks so old and dry. Kratom gives me anxiety and depression. I’m tired of being numb. I want to feel “life” again.

I have wanted to quit for so very long it has been my dark dark secret for many years. I finally came out to my family my friends and I even told my Doctor Who I did not expect to understand what it was. Thank God he knew exactly what it was and said yes it’s an opiate you’re addicted. He gave me some medication‘s to help through the first week. But it’s still going to be hell. I have been tapering down from a very heavy habit. I am now at about 15 g per day. By Friday that will be cut in half and I am jumping off.  I’m not sure I’ve ever been this scared in my life but I also have a sense of pride I haven’t felt in so long. My family is behind me and as embarrassing as it was to come clean to them I am so glad that dark secret is no more.  It has no more power over me.

Today is my day 1 off kratom, and I feel like it's going to be difficult for me. I've been a daily user for well over a year now. Typically never over 10 grams per day. Just enough to feel a bit of happiness before and after work.

I've noticed some nasty nausea issues cropping up, and we think kratom could be contributing because it's insoluble fiber. Honestly, I'll try anything to get relief from the nausea, vomiting, and bathroom trips.

I'm well into the morning now, and lo and behold--less nausea. Only one bathroom trip. I even ate breakfast which is rare.

I know I'm bound to get some headaches and maybe even a worse stomach as the kratom leaves my body, but I feel like I'm finally turning a corner toward a healthier future.

Anyone else experienced similar stomach issues and relief after quitting?

It's been a year now since I stopped using kratom and this community saved my ass.  My gratitude can never be fully expressed.  Seriously, I might not be here if it weren't for this sub.    The entire story is too long, but I'll give the salient points.    I didn't use all that long -- 1 year of use going anywhere from 10gpd to 20gpd with some breaks of 21 days in there before caving in and going back.   

It reached a point where the kratom was just making my physically ill to take and I just had no choice so I stopped.   I was aware of the lack of sleep and the acutes as well as the horrid anhedonia from stopping 21 days here and there, but this time every thing was WORSE.  No sleep for 10 days.   I didn't have a lot of other opiate-like withdrawal symptoms except the something was horribly different from oxies, subs, methadone and other classic opie withdrawal --- I did not know where I wanted to be or even who I was anymore.  I felt nothing for nothing -- it was a hideous anhedonia that gripped me.  I would drive hundreds of miles to Maine just to do something and not even leave the car -- turn around and come back.  I looked at trees and imagined hanging ropes over them.   The entire experience bled my soul white.   

This 'feeling' or symptom took a month to dissipate slightly, but the anhedonic, joyless state lasted for 4 months.  Over those 4 months it receded imperceptibly daily -- progress was very difficult to measure, but it came!   I'm tired of typing, but believe me it did pass.   After the anhedonia -- I was 'good' or at least back to a respectable level of joy or at least potential to experience happiness of some kind.   

Now, I WISH I could say I stopped everything and all is beautiful.   Nope.  I have no desire to mess with opies or kratom EVER!   I still have a habit of dipping back into certain exotic things, but only for a day or so and I PAY DEARLY.   I think I'm done -- seriously with everything.  No substances 'work' for me anymore -- I just pay a steep price even for 3 days.  Even weed confuses things.

Oh well, that's the story -- please hang in there -- love yourself.   I know what it's like to toss and turn in bed until you ache and you can't imagine you can stand anymore AND you have to go to work or deal with family, etc. -- scary, scary stuff!    Life is much, much easier without drugs, it's that simple -- I'm not preaching -- let's just say for me it is.  

All the best you you guys and thanks for the support!!

Its just a long withdrawal in terms of the mental aspect. kinda like coming off methadone or suboxone but not as intense. Just drawn out.

I need help and advice.,"So I posted last time that I was starting a CT from about a year of 20g usage a day. Well I didn’t come back and check in, didn’t reach out for help… so at the very beginning of day 6 I relapsed. The funny thing is I was just starting to feel better!!! Wtf. The insanity of addiction is so insidious and powerful. 

Ended up taking the Kratom for 3 days then starting CT again. Made it like 28 hours then was with my friend at a kratom bar (didn’t know those existed and didn’t know what I was walking into) So I broke and said I’ll try one kratom drink. I felt a tiny bit from it but barely nothing. Anyways it just gives me anxiety because I had to start over again bc of a stupid drink.

MOST IMPORTANT PART: I am back on the wagon I am not giving up. Today at 6pm was 24 hours from the kratom drink (that really did absolutely nothing .. not even sure if I should be counting it but whatever. So I’m on day 2. I took time off work and basically messed up all my time so I’ve got 4 more days before I go back to work. I’ll be going back to work on day 6. I really want this so bad and it’s embarrassing that I can’t get it. It’s so different from street drugs it’s like a milder but waaaayyy more drawn out withdrawal.

QUESTIONS: 

1. How did you guys feel on day 6? I’m freaking out about work bc I’m a server, have to interact with people and it’s very physical. I feel like I might still feel shitty on day 6.

2. Do you think that kratom drink affected my progress?

3. When does this end 😕 I’m really struggling this time around. Could use some support. Thank you guys ❤️",13

I didn’t look at anyones personal case story or road to quitting just the symptom list, considering I already have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, ( GAD ) I figured I would just have really bad anxiety. 

Today is day one of my taper to quitting. I took 2 doses today. Morning and 4pm ct. 

In the last by this time is have taken sometimes you to an ounce. 

I tried to get prepared. I got Lipsomal Vitamin C, L-theanine, L-Tyrosine, magnesium, Kava capsules ( extract ) as well as Voacatox which is a natural detox supplement where one of the 3 ingredients is known to help with withdrawal. To top it off ( thc gives me anxiety ) so I got CBD. ( which definitely is nice  ) a disposable vape. 

My body now- considering I took like an Oz a day or 6(ish)
Doses ( spoon-fulls in one of those little cups. ) 

I new this was going to be hard and no pain, no freaking gain, I will become healthier and happier by any means necessary or literally die trying. 

I’m prescribed clonidine for my blood pressure which had helped me in the past with Opiod/Opiate withdrawals ( chills, sweating, anxiety )

Am I over-doing it ? Should I have waited to take the kava and v-tox when I am not taking Kratom.  I figured I’d take this cocktail and a soon in the morning and one a night Just to not go cold turkey. 

I’m not addicted to this,(Bali)
I am dependent on it though. 

My body is telling me I need it like a diabetic’s body is telling them they need to take insulin. 

Now without the Kratom- anxiety, weird burning feeling throughout my body and weird, odd sensations in my legs. 

I can tell you I don’t enjoy these nasty withdrawal symptoms, but saying I’ve been kratom free for a month will make it all worth it! 

Are my at home OTC remedy cocktail too much ? Could this crap be making my stoa worse ?  

I am going to read other peoples stories because I’ve only seen the side affects
Online as far as lists. Ie…frost, nausea etc. I will read personal stories. I started typing this ballpark an hour ago. In and out of sleep.  

Stay safe EVERYONE! God bless. Any positive feedback?",7

I was using almost every day, and telling myself that it wasn’t an issue and I was using until I got off of probation. 

I started throwing up every morning and having awful anxiety every day, so I jumped. 

I had terrible acutes at first, throwing up, no appetite. Was able to take 2 weeks off of work. 

I am back at work now, and my whole day is filled with panic and anxiety, I can’t focus. And I get a cycle of weird physical WD symptoms (achy arm muscles, sweating)

I am sleeping maybe 2 hours a night, tossing and turning. I never had sleep problems before this. 

I just want this to stop already. I am taking anti anxiety medication (buspar) and an anti acid. If there are any tips anyone can give me they are appreciated. How you get to sleep, how you get motivation again, etc.",6

Could come back, but I think it may actually be gone. I will go 3 days or so in a row without even thinking of kratom. That's because I've been changing my life to be much different than how it used to be. Regular, rigorous exercise helps more than can be stated. I have no cravings, no desire to use now. This could just be a good past week or two and cravings will come back, but again we will see. I haven't really seriously craved kratom past the first few weeks. 

I'm very very glad I made this decision and went though what I needed to go through and continue to. Life isn't perfect, but the way I experience the world now vs how I did on kratom all the time is just night and day. It's still going to take a long time for my reward system to really heal all the way. I enjoy things a lot, like exercise. Sometimes it feels like I'm not enjoying the exercise like I'd usually be, sometimes I feel like I'm enjoying it just as much. Perhaps I'm just overthinking it. There's still some things that I stopped doing while addicted to this opioid that I haven't picked up again yet, mainly photography and writing. I think it's just a matter of pushing myself to do them again because my brain won't realize they are rewarding until I start doing it. 

However, there's a ton that I have picked up again. I'm on decently solid ground and I'm enjoying life at the moment.

However I ran out because my order takes longer to arraive then a thought. I was okay without it for 2 or 3 days using about 8g of iboga over a day, this probably removed most of the withdrawals, but I now have horribly intense brain zaps. When awake it wouldn't bother me, it just feels kinda weird, but when trying to sleep today I would just repeatedly get intense shocks in my head and body, it would literally got like ""zap...zap...zap..ZAPP"" within a few seconds and I just gave up on falling asleep. I'm okay with the withdrawals during the day, but I just wanna be able to sleep until I get the next order.

As far as I know, the brain zaps are caused from the withdrawals of the SSRI effects of kratom, so in my desperation I was wondering if an SSRI could get rid of it so that I can sleep at night. I couldn't find anything about that online- The strange thing is that besides the brain zaps I barely have any other withdrawal effects right now, maybe just being a bit more sensitive to cold and kind of a low mood, but nothing major. 

Or dose anyone know something else that could help with the brain zaps at night? Any help would be appreciated.",5

Days 9-15: Fatigue and depression worse! Cravings started to lessen and regardless of my symptoms I was okay to keep working and focus on my recovery.

Days 16-20: A bit better and I felt really grateful to be free.

Days 21-30: Half good days and half bad days. Improvement. Slow and steady wins the race 

31-40: Fatigue finally lessened, but I made a point to take care of myself (hydration, light exercise, early to bed).

40-45: I'm having more good days then bad days now.

I call today the “Day of Truth” because Monday mornings are when I end up caving typically. (I typically stop by the headshop on my work)

If I can just get through today then it will be much easier to get through tomorrow.

Once I get through tomorrow it will be that much easier to get through Wednesday.

Please send positive vibes may way and I hope everyone has a great week!",17

My starting dose of 15-20GPD has been cut in half from the start of the taper. I will be updating this weekly for those who want to follow. Doing about 2 doses of 4G every 24 hours. Anxiety and a high heart rate hit me at certain points. I don’t know how anyone quits CT, but you all have some insane Will-power if you can. 

I’m fully motivated. Started going back to the gym and eating healthier. I thought about taking my normal dose dozens of times, but I said to myself over 100 times this week, “Don’t be weak-minded. Don’t be soft. You’re better than this. You know how unhappy you are when you’re high on this crap. Don’t even think about it.” Motivational speeches towards myself seems to be helping. 

Starting tomorrow I’m going to try 2 doses of 3G every 24 hours to see if this week is any easier. We can do this everyone! If I can completely quit by a month, I will be absolutely thrilled. This crap doesn’t have to hinder us anymore. We can all do this!

WEEK 2:

Taking 3.5G twice a day for a total of 7G. The withdrawals are really starting to make me restless. Sleep is difficult but I’m pot-committed at this point. Thought about taking a much higher dose many times this week but fought that urge.",9

I keep telling myself I can be free of the physical withdrawals in about 7 days. That’s nothing. I should just do it. Wish me luck tomorrow. I kinda deserve to feel shitty since I have no self discipline. Hope everyone is doing ok and is sticking to quitting. I’m hoping I can maybe get at least two of the days off of work.

I jumped on Tuesday, the week was totally fine (thank you low dose habit/god/luck). I’d be distracted at work and then get home and eat, workout and go to bed. Easy.

This weekend has been a different story. I’ve kept pretty busy, going to the gym, running errands etc but WOW I’ve come close to caving. I’d usually dose on the weekends after going to the gym + running errands as a “reward” lol. 

I think because I had minimal withdrawals, my brain thinks I could casually use it. But I know in my heart I don’t want to. I just drank some vitamin C, rhodiola and turmeric. 

The fact is, euphoria is not something we are meant to feel every day. It’s just not. And I need to accept that. I have lost my right to recreationally use any substance like this. I can chase joy through exercise and connection. That is enough for me! This plant will not win!",25

I’ve wasted all my money and energy keeping it a secret. I was just taking capsules up to 14-20 at a time every 6 hours. Then when that wasn’t doing the trick I switched to the extract and then the capsule new stronger extract. That’s been a good six months now and I’m hooked hard. The embarrassment of being on a gas station drug bothers me and seems like a sad way to be. What mostly hurts and scares me is losing my partner who I’ve kept in the dark this entire time. 
     Enough of the back story on me. From what I’ve read on here in the past when I was hopefully going to quit was pretty troubling. Seems the detox can last month or more and may be as difficult to kick  as the hard drugs I did in the past when I was younger. 
  Currently at 2 extract caps every six hours. As in I haven’t started to detox because I’m a carpenter and have to be up and down ladders all day. Do y’all think if I switch back to non extract i can start to taper and is there any non narcotic help out there to help with the withdrawal? If anyone was in my shoes and succeeded please share your story here.
Thanks for reading along. The tunnel is dark but damn I hope I see the light soon and better yet hope I can get to the other side and be Kratom and opiate free.",5

Ive read alot of posts here on quitting kratom.  Ive been steady at about 4-5 liquid shots per day as I make good money and purchasing was never an issue.  Ive quit kratom for months and never had too many Wd symptoms besides diarrhea and depression.  I even ended up in jail for 7 days and of course couldn't do it t there.  So i was sitting there with anxiety.  Of course when i came out i went back at it.

Is there a good taper schedule for shots?   I have used Rhodeola Rosea supplements for dopamine replacement before.

I am just sick of spending money on this green crap.   I was a lot more clear minded and more motivated when i wasnt on it.

Does anybody have suggestions?",1

I feel like I’m actually soaking in life now. Like I’m genuinely enjoying my family and friends and things I’m experiencing and not just a superficial smile. I have so much more energy, I was getting to where I was so tired all the time on K everything was a chore and a burden. Even getting up to take out the trash or something small like that. I can tell that the friendships and relationships that I had are really flourishing. I don’t feel all awkward talking to people and have a lot of confidence back. 

I am still having bad days or bad periods but they are fewer and fewer as time goes on. I think I was expecting to be clean for a week or two and be back to my old self. That hasn’t been the case, it’s been hard but very rewarding. It’s only been three months after 8 years of over 30gpd. I’m realizing now it will probably be a while longer before I’m completely back. I think the rule of 1 month for every year you used will probably be more accurate. 

But overall, compared to where I was 3 months ago, it’s night and day. I’m a different person than I was 3 months ago. I’m back in the gym, starting to look muscular again and not just a skinny shriveled up guy that looks out of It. I’m making sure I stay hydrated and plenty of vitamins and probiotics. I am taking a fiber supplement as well because my stomach is getting better but was in pretty bad shape when I quit. 

Iv also done cryotherapy for inflammation I would really recommend it. It’s helped a lot. I think Kratom was starting to cause some of the lymph nodes in my throat to be swollen a lot, they have gotten a lot better since quitting but cryo and hydrating has really helped. 

Good luck to everyone beginning there journey. It’s worth it",35

**So, as you have already figured out... I'd like to join this beautiful family to take challenging journey with.... cold turkey. FOREVER GOOD BYE, YOU DISGUSTING SLUDGE !!!**

After 2 years I've known kratom (using with some pauses, on and off), I've decided I'll take this seriously, and hopefully ... with your support :). I've relapsed like month ago and it costs me another money (It's not the first time I've got rid of everything).

I used kratom to ease my anxiety problems - so as you imagine - the next days will be probably crazy, I know I can get serious withdorwals from the previous experiences. I've already prepared for insomnia (melatonine pills), but my stressed guts will probably kill me. I know already, that I can only wait for very dark mood, agression (seriously guys, I'm like a motherf\*%#&@ BITC# when I'm off kratom, ...then I suffer for skin sensitivity, diarrhoea,... and the next first days I probably will enjoy some headache, spine ache,... just... ""off-kratom flu"" :D ...again.

Guys... I'll be very glad If you'll support me. I'm not sure if it's possible without you. It's huge commitment. **I want my life back, the ""REAL ME"" BACK !!** The past few month just mould into one brainfog  and automatic pilot, who supposed to solve problems in my life. Get through job I hate (now on sick pay,... and plan to leave) and anxiety (just more go out, sport, run, meditation, read.....). I want to update here my journey everyday.

**Stay strong! Never take this sh\*t again. Live naturally, with God's love, no more unnecessary substances :).**

Take care

Physiological symptoms were never a big problem for me, i always struggle emotionaly. And i have never felt this bad in my life which is understandable. 

I would go for a hike as it helps me most, but my energy levels are still reeaally low. Plus i have persistant cold flushes, feels like freezing to death. If it werent for these two aspects of lingering symptoms, i would be already outside. 

I cant think of any other possible way to restore my serotonin and dopamine, everything else bores me, or gives me anxiety.

Ive used kratom for almost 10years. My daily dose was roughly 2tsp every 6-8x a day. It started with the ""wobbles"" but after decreased dosage (4 doses a day) I was getting vertigo. the last 3 months have been the worst! My dizzy spells were lasting hours sometimes a day at a time, just when I thought my dose was low enough (I took it down to 1tsp 4times a day) the dizzy spell would come again. I finally went and had my ears checked (due to some annoying popping) only to find both eardrums had liquid on them and one side was infected. Took the meds but noticed little change, went back again and was prescribed a steroid and nose spray which seemed to help the spells as well as the popping for a few days. Due to this I've really had to think about my health and how much kratom impacts it. Its hard know what's wrong physically when there are things in my system that could be contributing. 
I started taking kratom to help with anxiety and soon it was the center of my whole day and and activities I was doing. Im now a stay at home mom of 2 and between the dizzy spells, school and kids im just over messing with kratom. Over the course of 3 months I've gone from taking 2tsp 6x a day to ¼tsp 3x a day. My RLS has chilled out this last week and my mood has improved drastically! My temper isn't as short, music sounds better and I feel more myself.

I know that everyone is different and their bodies and minds handle things differently, but I am just looking for some general advice from people who have been through it.  I have a very important event coming up (a wedding over Thanksgiving), that I need to be the best version of myself for.  Considering that is only a few weeks away, if I went cold turkey this weekend, would I still be in the throes of acute withdrawal during that time?  

I'm not trying to make excuses not to quit (at least, I don't think so) but I'm wondering if it would be best to just continue to take it daily until after the event, and then quit.  Granted, I certainly have some undesirable personality traits even on it (shortness with people, general moodiness) but my thoughts are it might be exponentially worse if I am going through withdrawal during that event.

I took 60-70gpd for my last 6 months of use, and used for a total of 4 years. I know my dosage was very high and length of use is also a pretty good stretch of time, so I knew my w/D's would be bad, but idk how much longer I can go without sleep.

Any comment would be appreciated.

P.s. I do take plenty of sleep time supps (l theanine, melatonin, valerian root, magnesium, and aschwaganda) and none of them seem to have any effect on me. I took Xanax a couple nights but it had 0 effect as well so I quit taking that for sleep already. This sucks. I want to be done with this shit but it's feeling really difficult without being able to sleep.

Thanks everyone!

Next day EDIT: After what may have been my worst day of all, I slept a LOT! Okay, now I won't lie, I cheated a little bit. Although I said I was done trying Xanax for sleep during this, I decided one more time to try at a higher dosage. I could tell my RLS was coming on strong and felt like another night like that would've killed me. So I took 1.5mg of Xanax, which from my understanding, is a fairly high dosage. I didn't think much of it since I've used 1mg multiple times in the past and literally did not feel a thing, or notice any difference in my anxiety/relaxation. Anyways, that extra .5mg combined with me not sleeping for a week was fucked up. I ended up ""waking up"" all over the house from 12am to 3am. I literally woke up on my inversion table in my basement slowly tilting back, and when I came to it I realized my feet weren't strapped in. I literally could have slipped out of that thing and snapped my neck in half and died. 

I actually knew what was happening at that point and all I could think was ""don't lose your focus, stay in the moment, stay awake up there"" and that would work for a couple minutes, then I'd come to it again in a completely different place in the house. I even had a conversation with my mom while I took my blood pressure at 2am. I had to ask her if that was real because it seemed like so much of a dream.

All I can say is, I was very lucky to not do anything stupid enough to hurt myself in anyway. Glad I got the sleep, but definitely won't be doing that dumb shit again.  Crazy how I've taken 1mg probably 10× in my life and almost never felt a damn thing. No sleep + .5mg more = me blacking out .. who woulda known",3

So the first time I quit I went CT and put my body in SUCH a state of shock that I don’t want to do that again. The second time I did a dirty taper where I went CT for a few days then added it back in to sleep and eventually stopped taking it all together. That worked best for me. Now I’m gonna try to just quickly taper my dose and hopefully have withdrawals but not to the point where my body is fighting for it’s life hahaha. It’s been two days and I’m over half down on my dose w/ very minimal withdrawal so far. What was the best way to quit in your opinion. No wrong answers. Everyone is different and withdrawal happens regardless. There are just ways to make the experience a tiny bit less miserable.

Cold turkey.,"I remember the first time I took kratom, a co worker offered me some and I couldn’t believe how laid back and carefree I felt. I felt amazing. My life is very stressful as everyone else’s. Kratom made everything “okay”. 

You don’t care how much money you spend as long as you have enough to get though the week, that you have enough for whatever event you’re having, or enough for an upcoming stressful situation. 

The first time I quit completely for 7 months and withdrawals were torture. Here I am again after I thought I could control myself. I was at the point where kratom was just another thing. I didn’t gain anything from kratom anymore. I lost weight, I lost friends, I lost money, I lost interest in everything. Day 3 and 4 have been pretty rough, dealing with the waves and the little to no sleep. But when I get out of one of the waves it’s nice actually feeling real happiness for once, or to feel the wind hit my face and actually notice it. I’m tired of being ashamed of taking kratom and always feeling like I needed to hide it from people. Music sounds better to me now, and I’m starting to enjoy the little things more. There’s so many little things it takes from you, you don’t realize until you finally get off.  

If anyone is reading this and is struggling, however hard it is, however sick you feel, you’ll get there, and things will be better off. Stay strong.",49

You can find many posts about this on this subreddit. I also get this reaction to coffee but I get it with stimulants as well. It's been the cause of many panic attacks. I know Kratom messes with your adrenals, and that coffee as well as stimulants can ""overwork your adrenals"" So maybe the damage that kratom does to your adrenals, plus putting extra stress on them causes your body to go into overdrive?

The crazy thing is a few people have said this side effect has gone on indefinitely. Even longer than a year. So is it possible kratom causes permanent damage/changes to your body? Does anyone actually have an idea why kratom has created so many ex-coffee drinkers? Some people can't even handle alcohol after quitting! It just seems so bizarre, especially considering how it seems to be a permanent change for some. If anyone has any insight on this that would be awesome.

The last two days i tried to split my dose into two doses of 3 grams but i ended up slipping back to about 12 grams. i didnt let myself go over that though.

I've had severe symptoms so far. Nausea, vomiting, shaking, insomnia, severe body pain. but its letting up a little more each day.

My plan is to take it at this same dose i'm at for a week until my body gets used to it before i drop down anymore. I also have to work so i save my one dose for the middle of the day at work when it gets busy but it doesnt even last until i get off of work.

I think 6-12 grams a day from 50-60 in a week is a huge amount of progress but idk at the same time. I cant tell if i'm thinking correctly rn and if this is actually a good plan or not.

Wondering if anyone could look over my plan and see how I could improve/be given advice and tips on it.","My plan will consist of 3 days of four 4g doses spaced evenly throughout the day. I have extra strong bso caps 1 a day, turmeric 1 a day, heat rub as needed, pregablin for rls and muscle cramps (possibly the worst wd for me). Diazepam for anxiety, use as required, but always the minimum dose possible also to help with sleep if needed. 
(I have just finished day 3 and it hasn't been so bad, not had to use anything other then cbd so far, I have a holiday in 13  days which I want to be completely Kratom free for) 

So I'm think I could do 4 days now of 4g, 3 times daily. I am also thinking if there is a good plan for the pregablin for the muscle pain and cramp? As required? Or lower doses spread out throughout the day? I also have diazepam which I will use to try and get sleep at night time. As much as required first couple nights, then taped it down as fast as possible  as I do not want to get any adverse effects from the diazepam and pregablin. I will also have delta9+CBN throughout. 

That will leave me with a solid 7 days to take the plunge of no Kratom at all, I will still use everything else sparingly and only if I really need to. I do tend to get really bad wd's 

Mainly cramps,rls, anxiety and depression, insomnia
 I will do regular exercise throughout. 

Then my holiday will be 7 days up in the mountains where I can do lots of grounding, walking, meditating etc to really relax and recover. 

Thought-out the whole process I will keep a journal to reflect on, meditate and do yoga as much as possible and stay as active as possible. 

If anybody has any pointers or ways to improve it, please let me know you guys advice :) 

Last thing is I would hate to get stuck on pregab or Diaz, so any info on how long I can use without withdrawal or problems from them would be great. 

Love to all x

Edit: or my worst case scenario is to slow the taper down and Take some Kratom with me on my holidays and just carry on the taper whilst I am there.. although I would prefer not to do this in all honesty",5

This months I have a long vacation from work so I thought it would be a good idea to quit slowly and taper.

So far it's been good, I am doing almost-sub active doses to not feel WD, I almost don't take anything through the day, however when night comes, after having dinner, psychologically I have a very hard time not dosing.

Why? because I feel I need the kratom to ""relax"" and get sleepy. I´ve learned my mind/body that habit and damn it does difficult to try to go to sleep without taking it. It's like I am not going to ever feel relaxed/sleepy.

The rest of the day its fine, I have gotten use to to feeling ""sober"" and I even enjoy the clear-headedness. It lets me be way more productive and I am able to meditate finally!

But the night its sooo difficult to let it go :(",8

This community was extremely helpful during that time, especially during the early days of withdrawal.  This is the first time I’ve been a year clean and sober in about 6 years.  I’ve been in and out of recovery for about 15 years now.  Feels good, don’t think of using very often anymore.  There are still times when I get some bad ideas and even very rarely a craving.  Im working the steps in NA with a sponsor.  Life is pretty good, but it’s not all rainbows and unicorns.  I keep subscribed to this sub because I see constant reminders of how painful withdrawal was.  That helps me stay grateful for being on the better side of things.  Anyway, just checking in to let people know it’s possible to kick the bad habit.  If I can do it, you can too.  Thanks for all the support folks.  ❤️❤️.  Edit:  for those curious, I was on 15-25gpd before this last quit, but had been on 30gpd for over a year not too long before that.

I know everyone is different in recovery, I say this because I notice many posts from people who have been clean for months and state that they are still feeling shitty. Well I’m here to say that I’m a month and some change in CT and I feel great. I do not get cravings what so ever. I notice a HUGE difference in energy when waking up early for work. On kratom I would wake up and feel like shit and have difficulty staying awake. Now once I’m up I’m good just like the good old days. Mentally I’m also great have not gotten PAWS yet. In all honesty I doubt I’ll get them (knock on wood).  What helped me most was exercise and Wim Hoff breathing. As I stated in other posts, it’s all about replacing a bad addiction with a good one. I set goals for push-ups. When I first started I hardly did 6 in a row now I’m up to 30. My point is it DOES GET BETTER. It amazing not having to think about the next dose. It’s like you are free and in control. Ask yourself are you willing to take kratom for THE REST OF YOUR LIFE? If no then you gotta quit sooner than later. The longer you take the harder it gets. I swear I was so scared going CT I never thought I would be able to function and be myself but here I am feeling better than ever more energetic than ever and a better me off kratom.  I take the time to post this because such posts gave me hope when I was trying to quit.  I’m just passing it on. You are stronger than you think. You got this!

My dosage before quitting: 4-7 GPD, but most days I’d take 2 before work and 3-3.5 after work. So my dose was pretty low. I decided to quit and tapered down to 3 GPD for about a week and a half and then jumped.

Well guys, it’s been pretty great. I feel so lucky. I have slept 8 hours both nights, and my only symptoms are a little dizziness, skin crawling and sweating a little. That’s it so far. I have actually felt happy and more present since I stopped taking it! And music sounds AMAZING!! I know I’m not out of the weeds, but wow! If anything, let my experience be a promotion for tapering/getting your dose as low as possible. I’ve been able to go to work and kick ass all week. I also normally take supplements, eat healthy and workout 3-4x a week, so maybe that had something to do with it. No idea. 

For those of you going through full blown withdrawals, you have all of my respect. Thank you all for posting here, it’s been nice to have a space where I don’t have to hide this part of my life.",4

Kratom made me miserable and demotivated, especially toward the end. It made me drop out of college, isolate, lose my friends and prevented me from making new ones at school because I was so introverted and focused on getting high. I started using it really heavily when i quit weed and alcohol for probation. Although i still smoked pretty much daily with some breaks, and drank occasionally, although I didnt enjoy it as much because hangovers are so much worse and I just take kratom and puke all thru the next day.

Then I finally quit. I was completely out of money, jobless, depressed, unhealthy, had 0 prospects, no real friends, 0 sex life, no interests. And for a month, I didnt do much but smoke weed, and I started getting back into my hobbies and feeling better. That is untill i started drinking a 6 pack every night, and just ended up replacing dosing kratom all the time with alcohol. 

Then, 8 months into that quit, i also decided to stop drinking daily, and of course in 2 weeks i took kratom again, because why not? i was bored, lonely, and needed some sort of reward for the suffering i had been enduring. At least it wasn't booze. I took it for a month then quit for 12 days, then took it for 2.5 weeks, quit for 12 days, took it 2.5 weeks quit for 4 days took it 4 more and now we are at day 3 clean lol. 

Thinking about how i should be at 11 months, and if i just stuck with the not drinking, or quit after that first withdrawal 3 months ago even makes me sad. Im stuck in this fucking loop, and altho my life is so much better today than 11 months ago, Its still so fucking far from where I want it to be, and I can only really enjoy a life like this if im numbing myself with drugs and alcohol daily so I dont have to face the reality of my situation. 

I dont want to endup like the people around me, I wanna get out of this shit town (moving in january:)) and pursue the dreams ive had for so many years but have neglected due to the easiness of indulging in the instant pleasure that drugs have to offer.

I dont really want to accept the fact that im going to be completely sober for the rest of my life, but I definitely want to be kratom free forever. It brings nothing good into my life, except for making it easier for me to be lazy and keep me from becoming who I am supposed to be.

I was a 70g/day user. It initially saved my life from heroin, but after around a year, the negative side effects really became apparent. I isolated. Kratom initially made me very social, but then I felt dumb, uninterested in human contact, became a hermit. And the loss of sex drive? Holy shit! I'm used to that side effect, having been a horrible heroin addict, but somehow, kratom was worse. And the wds! I will admit, I often find some of the quitting kratom posts to be a little alarmist, or deeming a plant evil, simply bc one had negative interactions with it. But after years of heavy use, I was amazed at how bad the wds were. I'd wake up at 4am in full withdrawal, while having worse restless legs than I'd ever had. Anyway, the final straw was when I realized that my hair started to fall out in alarming amounts. I'm 43,so I thought maybe I was going bald, though I've had a full head of hair? It got so bad, everywhere were these inch and half hairs, and what hair I DID have, looked strawy and sick. My hair has almost fully recovered now. I can tell it's still thin, will probably take another 6 months to completely heal, but it's already SO much better. So if you're worried about permanent loss, I feel like it gets almost completely better. Hope that helps.",46

I went from 24 caps to 21 caps on Oct 5th (7 x 3) = 10.5g total

I went from 21 caps to 18 caps on Oct 8th (6 x 3) = 9g

I went from 18 to 15 caps on Oct 14th (5 x 3) = 7.5g

I went from 15 to 12 caps on Oct 18th (4 x 3) = 6g

I went from 12 to 9 caps on Oct 25th (3 x 3) = 4.5g

Finally I went from 9 caps to 6 caps on Nov 1 (2 x 3) = 3gpd

Right around here I've started to experience some fairly bad waves of anxiety.  For some reason I didn't think it was from the kratom taper initially, because I didn't notice a thing tapering down by half over the first 2 weeks, but I guess that's typical in a taper (vs going CT).

Now here's my issue.  I thought things were a breeze, until this anxiety hit.  Now I am wondering, am I tapering a bit too quickly?  If so, would it be best for me to go back up one step of my taper?  Or should I perhaps try taking 1 extra 0.5g cap 2-3x per day if I start to feel the waves of anxiety?

I've gone through alcohol withdrawal a few times before and I tend to have some pretty bad physical symptoms, but not much anxiety.

I've got some BSO caps and Ashwagandha caps coming today.  I take magnesium, multivitamin, C, D, B100 complex. 

tldr; I went from 12gpd to 3gpd over about 4 weeks and my anxiety is through the roof!

I am okay tapering longer if it means this anxiety goes down subtantially, but will it just draw it out longer?  If I could quit without this anxiety by tapering over the course of 6 months, I think I would, at this point!",3

Hey all. Just wanted to tell everyone that’s struggling to jump that it’s possible. You will get there. As the days go by and you keep using, it seems there’s no end in sight. It will happen. There may be more suffering before it finally happens but it will happen. Hopefully the type of pain that happens isn’t something irreversible. 

I’ve been on Kratom for over five years. 50gpd. I had a period of quitting for seven months then relapsed two years ago. These past two years of using I could NOT seem to quit or even get three clean days. There will come a point when the stars align and you jump and when you do fight like hell to not look backwards. Keep moving one day at a time. One hour at a time. It won’t be easy but I can tell you it’s easier than the misery of having your soul trapped by this drug. I’m feeling pretty good at this point. Not completely normal, but good. It’s either face all the thoughts and troubles of life head on, or keep escaping. Escape is easy until it inevitably catches up with you and manifests as anxiety and depression. I hope you all have the courage and will to keep up the good fight 🙏",31

But a few months later that changed and it was back to cycles of loosing lots of hair regularly. And the cystic acne takes a month or 2 off then those stupid covid masks became a welcome accessory hiding the awful breakouts.

If the 2 medicines they prescribed work I will return to post results. 

I understand kratom still isn't commonly known about so I wasn't surprised neither the nurse practitioner or doctor knew what it was. But it made zero difference in deciding what treatment to start me on. 

A month previous I had standard bloodwork tests done and even though it was a treatment clinic for drug and alcohol issues the nurse practitioner there had no knowledge of kratom either.

It's been tough getting passed 4 days. I have no idea why but by my 4th day I break down and come up with some reason as to why I should go buy a shot and have a really awesome session at the gym. Gives me energy and I even feel more flexible. But not lately I've just been exhausted. My soul is tired. I keep going two days, relapse. Use for a week. 3 Days, relapse, use for weeks.. and its just up and down and up and down. 

I feel so damn alone in this its incredible. I do everything alone. I haven't been in a relationship in a few years and its no wonder why. I decided to make a post about this because I come on here and read everyone's experiences and I don't feel as alone in this. I've been through heroin withdrawals and as I can say these aren't nearly as bad... That doesn't take away from how bad the withdrawals are now and how upset I am to be going through this. Like restless legs again at night... are you kidding me?! 

This has been the biggest monkey on my back. And it is chopping away at my identity dose by dose. I can't even enjoy the highs anymore because I feel the worst guilt. Like man im going to lose my hair from this shit. What type of person is going to want to put up with this? It makes me so numb. I dont enjoy anything anymore.

I quit for a week, had a rough week at work and did it through the weekend and than back off for a week. I ended up buying some more for a busy weekend and ended up quitting my job that friday. I used the last of that over the weekend and have been clean for like 16 or 17 days. The anxiety of not having a job and the boredom at home got me today and i went and bought 2 shots. The plus side is i got a lot of things done today that i have been putting off. I don’t plan on buying more tomorrow. I just wanted a break from the endless anxiety. It is so weird i have this weird jittery energy but i can’t bring myself to get motivated to do anything. I am waiting on 2 jobs who are taking there time, even though i know i probably have whichever one i want the waiting is killing me. Also i just jacked up a couple credit cards hitting the casino. which is also giving me anxiety. I just can’t seemm to stop. Stupid i know. Trading one addiction for another. Sorry for the rant. Just needed to get that out. I don’t want to tell my wife. She doesn’t understand.",8

I’ve experienced heroin and methadone withdrawal. CT for heroin which felt like torture, and Methadone… I was on somewhere between 85-135mg for 5 years. When I got off Methadone, I rapid tapered down to 60 and then went CT. It was rough but I was determined. The physical symptoms lasted a while… I didn’t sleep for 27 days… (And because some asshole called me a liar, I’m editing to say that I could only sleep for about 5-10 mins and then my body would jolt awake. It was a bit torturous) and the first real sleep I got was about an hour and it was wild. I was wide eyed and my mind felt hyper but my body had zero energy. The leg pain, RLS, lack of appetite, racing thoughts, chills, and fatigue were my worst symptoms. That and the feeling of wanting to jump out of my body.

I’m wondering what K will be like in comparison. Because for me, I start feeling like crap if I don’t have a dose by hour 4/5….  I don’t understand how some people can get down to 1-2 doses per day. I’m dosing 4.5g every 4 hours. I have 5 doses per day. 

I’m trying to stretch the doses to every 5 hours but it’s been hard. How am I going to do this if it’s hard for me to get past 4-5 hours? My dose starts to fade by hour 3 and I just hang on from that point. I’ll try to take a nap but my body is restless and jittery. Wtf.

I really need to get off this evil crap. I take tablets so it’s easy for me to just take more to feel better but I have not. I’ve been consistently stretching and lowering. 5 tablets is 1.5g. I need 15 tablets each dose and I’m just so tired.

Any advice? Any comparison between H or M withdrawal vs K? I know I can do this, it’s just hard when I have to be on point for certain things. It’s harder to stretch myself when I have something important I need to do so sometimes I’ll end up dozing at hour 4 instead of stretching it to 5 because I have an important meeting/appointment/call. It gets in the way.

 I thought I had taken my dpla again in evening and it seemed like my pain and cravings were coming back and just though oh well they probably just work for a week or so and at least it got me threw the week.

Woke up this morning all achey so decided to see if maybe I had taken the vitamin c instead and thats what it was.I had apparently megadosed on vitamin c instead.I heard vitamin c also helps with withdrawals and it wasn't as bad as it usually is with body aches.It does seem to help a little but the dpla helps tremendously, absolutely would recommend trying it.

I know what to expect as I’ve tapered slowly and , the pain will be minimal to divorce and breaking up our family.  

Seems I’ll cut down around 2 g per day with this method.  Seems fast but I try to wait as long into the day as possible before I dose and definitely save one for sleep.  

I have some comfort tinctures by Freida - a CBD/hemp tincture and one call taper tonic that has skullcap, passionsflower, ginger, and some other relaxing things.  

I may go to urgent care to see about getting some gabapentin and clondine.   

2 week taper, too fast?   Should I just CT?  (My job is very physical, mental and I have to be in a good mood, no way i could do it while in WD).

Plus a taper tip for anyone else,"Hey all, so this all has been going on a long time. I’ve struggled with addiction most of my life. Last year was the absolute worst and I went to detox twice for alcohol. So I got out last November and then quit alcohol, then tapered myself off Xanax, then tapered myself off ambien and then tapered my kratom from 30gpd down to about 2-2.5gpd. I had a little blip the last 6 months because I was in a toxic relationship. I started drinking again (not crazy like before but def not healthy amounts), my kratom use increased, hell even my nicotine use. Anyway I’m a week off alcohol again and luckily my kratom use only went up to about 3-4gpd. So I’ve tapered myself again over the last few days and am down to 1.5gpd. I want to be off this and all substances by Christmas. I realize the only time I’ve had a deep belly laugh and was my normal outgoing, funny, goofy self was for a couple days in detox. I’ve literally spent the last 5 years addicted to kratom, taking it every 3 hours and im over it. I’ve become anxious, antisocial, and numb. I never felt like it made me numb or different but it’s becoming clear to me it def has. I just wanna feel like me again. Hoping im strong enough to see this through. Also a tip for anyone tapering: when your withdrawals peak, for me it’s usually about day 3-4 after a drop, that’s when you should do your next drop. I know it sounds counterintuitive, but you won’t really feel the next drop for a few days, so if you drop on the bad day then by the next day you’ll start feeling better and you’ll feel mostly normal right before the next bad day. This will keep your taper progressing quickly without getting stuck at the same dose trying to get your body to stabilize. Just my experience. Thank you all for your support!",28

I'm currently bored at work and have a little bit of time to kill so I've decided to give an update as to where I'm at in my journey.

I'm very happy and grateful to be 38 days off of Kratom and 34 days off of cannabis and all other substances. I picked up my 30 day key tag from an NA meeting recently! 

So! Obviously I'm not dealing with acutes anymore, so that is a blessing. And just a little information: I used kratom on and off for 4 years (since I was 20). In the beginning it wasn't that much of a problem. Until it was. That was about two years ago when stuff got real. I went from 6 capsules a day, to about 12 capsules a day, then to about 20 capsules per day. And sometime after that I quit. And then when I started again, I bought an extract shot. And from that day forward I was hooked. 20 dollars a day on Kratom, and then to 40 dollars per day. And then I lost count because I was taking leaf kratom and extracts in different amounts every single day to self medicate. After 20,000 dollars debt from kratom and other drugs, ER trips, and a 70 day trip to rehab that started in May of this year, I used k and cannabis again at the end of my treatment. After detoxing, residential, therapy, and groups for a couple months, I flew home and became deeply depressed and bought kratom. I let my family down once again and still haven't regained their trust.

Fast forward to the end of September, I threw in the towel and enough was enough. I need to get my shit together. On the 25th of September, I gave up kratom and cannabis on the 29th. I've been 100% sober ever since. I'm very glad I didn't turn back to the harder things I was using.

Before I went to treatment I lost 55 pounds and had sores all over my body. My mom said I looked like I was being poisoned and wouldn't live long. Honestly I probably wouldn't have. And out of all the drugs I've used, KRATOM had one of the biggest holds on me for years.

I have since gained 60 pounds and I'm a healthy 24 year old guy at 6'2 and 202 pounds.

I'm starting to get my energy back and I'm finally starting to sleep a little bit better. I still have a long way to go and PAWS is definitely doing it's thing. 

If I don't hydrate, get enough sleep, and make proper choices for myself I start going in reverse and I get depressed. Making the hard right choices and doing the next best thing is going to give me a second chance at life.

So if you're struggling with PAWS or acutes even. Know that this too shall pass. If you want to feel better and PAWS are kicking your ass, hydrate, get more sleep, do something to make yourself feel better. We do not take good enough care of ourselves nowadays.

I want everyone who reads this to discover their self love. I hated myself just a few months ago, my self esteem was gone. It's not where it needs to be, but meetings, recovery, and self care are changing my life.

Please don't let kratom or any other drugs rule your lives. There's always a light at the end of the depression, anxiety, and self-hate if you do the right thing and seek that light!",25

I’ve been struggling with Kratom for almost 5 years now. 

I just had 25 days under my belt. But even thought things were looking up, I took on too much with a job that was just way too demanding. Be it side eff effects from quitting Kratom or my usual terrible insomnia…I completely fell apart and had to quit a week ago. 

Quitting naturally sent me down a more intense spiral and alcohol and adderall worked their way into everything. 

This is my Day 2. And the hardest part for me is that I have no one I can truly confide in. I wish I could just tell someone exactly what was going on.  But instead…I’m laying here in an apartment I just moved into without a job…counting the days to the end of the month where I will be well short on my rent.

If that happens, I’ll have to go home and that’s the last thing I want to do. But I guess what I want doesn’t really matter anymore. 

What’s so aggravating is the stupid stuff doesn’t even work for me. Like on it, I’d still be just as unproductive, but with a sense of peace. But to everyone else, they see the same lazy slug one way or another.

It’s so hard to not want to force my body forward…I object “there’s no way this is because of Kratom” and insist I should be normal on day 3. And yet, I don’t even honestly know what I’ve done to my body. Even today, you can barely find any actual facts on what it does to your body. 

It’s stupid because if I stop…my mood almost always recovers in under two weeks. And every time I feel better I can’t believe how amazing normal actually is. I vow to never let that stuff into my body and then sure enough it happens again. 

I’m sorry guys. I just feel like this is the only place I can honestly be authentic. This is a scary, scary place to be. And I’m tired of being trapped.

Seems like i just got brain fog and a general disintrest in everything right now, but its better than the abhorred depression and intrusive thoughts i was getting from kratom after 6 months of sustained use( 10 days clean from jail time )Woulda done it sooner but 5 weeks ago i did something really stupid and got on phenibut for almost 4  weeks and had to go through those withdrawls first, been taking fasoracetam for phenibut withdrawl but im thinking maybe it helped today for kratom symptoms, i have no way to tell and there is little experienced evidence online, but other than that plenty of black tea and water helped , as well as kava for the non existing sociability. Ive heard  vitamin C can help alot but have decided on not megadosing that today ( i take multivitamins and try to eat fruit ) maybe tomorrow if it gets worse, i also bought a mood lift supplement with 5htp for sNg basically idk if it would help or if i wanna risk taking it yet but it is there. Thought id share, its definitely not as bad as heroin or phenibut ( never touch phen if you have been addicted to any substance) , it honestly feel more like meth withdrawl than anything, but like if you used very little amounts.

Day 44 of my total quit/taper.

3rd time trying.

I haven't slept in over 30 days.  I take these little 20 min naps here and there.

I try to excersize as much as possible and for me I'm limited in what I can do.  I can still cycle so I do that 

I have been for 5 years.  My personal best time on a common climb was 5:49.  I put everything I had into that climb to hit that mark.  While using alot of kratom

Today 21 days clean, feeling like dog crap I ran a 5:29.  I wasn't even breathing hard..  I couldn't believe it and chalked it up to maybe a good day, but I wasn't tired at the end of the ride so I did the loop again and pushed it to a 5:14.  

To me that's amazing.  I'm actually already physically more capable than I have been in last 5 years.  Despite being 20 lbs heavier since I got fat trying to quit this sludge I ate alot of junk to stave off cravings.

Another problem I need to deal with.

So that's the good news.  But there is bad news too.

Yesterday I went to taco bell, which Is my favorite fast food joint.  I ordered my usual and they told me they don't have any chicken menu items anymore.  I lost my marbles and literally freaked out, screamed at the lady, I took that pretty personal. 

Looking back I can't believe I did that, what is wrong with me.  I'm dealing with rage issues that I never had before. Like real bad.

Rage and being fat.  Not a good combo.

 But I'm off the sludge.  And not going back.",10

I won't lie, the first 2-3 years was amazing and kratom helped everything from workouts to making basic tasks more enjoyable and helped stave off illness when everyone else was getting sick. But like anything, the honeymoon can't last forever, but the problem is/was I was the last to see it. For the last 2 years or so I was struggling with a really short temper and having a difficult time finding joy in things. I simply used Covid as the excuse and believed it until my wife and kids started to call me on it and even then I was able to find a way to blow it off. 

Then 3 weeks ago my mom called me and out of the blue asked if everything was going okay and I was taken aback and said it was and why was she asking. She unloaded on me about how ""cold"" I've been with everyone and that I seemed depressed and lost the ""light"" in my mood. I finally realized that there was only one thing in my life that this could be attributed to and that was my kratom use. I decided then and there I was going to be stopping for good.

We had a trip to Mexico booked the week after for a big celebration party for a friend and thought it would be the perfect time to taper and stop because the beach, friends, etc would take my mind off of it. So I started breaking off .5 grams going into the week of the trip and would continue to taper while there. This ended up being terrible because I spent 2 days with full flu like symptoms and was incredibly achy and had stomach cramps that wouldn't let me sleep. By the 3rd day I was down to 1g a day and started getting the lethargy but I hid it with multiple expressos throughout the day and of course having drinks with everyone. By the end of the trip I was still tired but aches gone and decided once home that would be cold turkey time.

This was 8 days ago and I loaded up on Black Seed Oil, Tongkat Ali, and Magnesium. I will say that these supplements made a HUGE difference as I had 1-2 days after CT where I was restless and wanting a dose so badly but I resisted and now that feeling is gone.

Day 9 today with no kratom after 5+ years and I actually feel lighter and less stressed than I have in a long time. No worrying about when to dose or how, and my mood is actually feeling back to what I remember. My daughter even mentioned it today. I can't wait for the next days and continuing to get back to who I really am without the addiction over me. 

Oh, and libido is coming back, which is the best thing ever!",20

However by day 8 i was suffering extreme mental withdrawal.  Full of anxiety and depression.  I was suprised at how bad w/d from kratom is for me.  Ive been addicted to H and pain pills and don’t recall the w/d this bad.  BTW i was only on kratom for 4 mos and had a hard time taking t breaks.  So i went CT.   Like i mentioned by day 8 i was really struggling mentally.  I had some leftover 2 mg suboxone strips from when i was on it for 3 years, and the w/d from subs  was rough but i got thru it.  I decided to take a 2 mg sub and it helped greatly. I took another 2 mg the next day, skipped a day yesterday but was having a rough morning today and took another 2 mg suboxone today.   My main question is does anyone know after taking it for 3 days if I’ve developed a dependence on it? Or should i be ok if I don’t take anymore.  They were hell to get off of b4 but i was on them for 3 years.

Quitting CT resulted in a few days of hell, but I managed. I was surprised to have such serious withdrawal symptoms from such light usage.

It's now been a month and all the symptoms are gone except I get debilitating anxiety every afternoon. It starts with a rapid, hard heartbeat, followed by my body heating up and some dizziness. If I don't medicate with gabapentin and benzos it turns into a full blown panic attack.

It's really awful and I don't know if I can keep living like this. I'm really scared it's never going to stop. What can i do?? I'm getting close to beginning to dose a gram or two when I feel the anxiety coming on. I don't think I'll relapse and start using multiple grams, multiple times per day. The reason I quit wasn't cause it was ruining my life, it was just giving me terrible nightmares. I'd take the nightmares over this severe physical anxiety.",6

This is the first time I've tapered. I usually go cold turkey, but I'm so exhausted mentally and physically that the thought of intense withdrawals is more than I can bear right now.

I have to say that I only find tapering to be marginally better. Props to everyone who can step down without getting symptoms. It's just not me. I'm still out of energy and either unable to poop or it's all I do is poop. I was taking about 6 extract shots a day. I've got it down to about 12 bittersweet grams per day, give or a take.

I'm thinking I may just go cold tomorrow. My fear is that even tapering is wearing me down a bit. I don't want to get down to a low dosage only to find I'm too exhausted to step off.

I started with a big cut down to about 8 or 9 gpd split in two, which definitely caused WD symptoms and was difficult enough to slip up to 11 grams on a handful of days. Been at this dose for maybe 3 weeks, and I'd dose as soon as I woke up at 6:30 from cravings and morning discomfort, and be itching for that second dose by noon. Then suddenly 3 days ago I made it til 11 am without even thinking, only took 2 grams rather than 3.5 or 4 for my first dose, and easily made it til 4pm for my second dose before taking again only 2.5 instead of 4. The next day was the same, and today has also been the same. I'm even sleeping relatively fine. 

I'm just confused, this casual lack of concern over when I can next take some and absence of intense craving/justification to take more is completely new. Ive essentially dropped from 9 grams to less than 5, and haven't noticed any major WD symptoms either. I tried to isolate any new thing in my life that may be making this okay but nothing at all has changed. I was genuinely feeling fearful that I wouldn't be able to taper the day before this. 

Is this a fairly common experience among those who taper or did I get hit by lightning or something? Curious about others experiences.",3

Let me start this post by saying that I'm obviously not an expert and while I mainly post this to hopefully help some of you guys, I'll be grateful if more knowledgeable people, and/or people who have longer experience with mega dosing Vit C, can give me some tips for dosaging details or even the chemistry behind this.

But let's get to the point:

I'm on day 25 CT now.

Day 1-22 quite sucked. I didn't have INSANELY bad days like some people here do, but in exchange, it also didn't really become better at all. Day 22 felt like day 3, just with paws on top.

Mainly out of despair I googled mega dosing Vit C after having read it a few times here. I absolutely didn't have much hope, but I think most people here understand if I say that when we suffer like we do from withdrawal, we clutch at any straw available - and Vit C isn't exactly the most dangerous thing I've contemplated these weeks.

Well. I started taking a lot of Vit C on the morning of day 23. In the evening, I suddenly felt great and played MtG on my laptop for hours, which I haven't been able to enjoy since WD started.

Day 24, I continued to feel amazing (well, in contrast - it's not 100% gone, but at the least 2/3 are). However, I also took sleeping pills on day 23 (I try to only take them about twice a week) and had a great sleep for once. So I thought, maybe that's the reason, so I didn't post here yet.

Day 25, I didn't take any sleeping pills the night before and this literally slept for only an hour (Insomnia is the one single thing that's, so far, not positively affected by Vit C for me). And still, I feel great today.

paws (5/10) are gone basically completely. Fatigue (8/10) is a 3/10 now. Physical pain (4/10) is barely noticable anymore.

This stuff simply works!!!

I don't sell any Vit C, there's no reason to bullshit here. Check out my post history if you want.

Please, just give it a try!

Now, regarding the details for anyone interested:

1. It doesn't seem to matter much which kind of Vit C you take, everything seems to work. The thing that differs is rather how hard the stuff is on your stomach in high doses, afaik.
2. I took and take about 3000mg/day, which is still rather low for a mega dose - but I'd advise anyone to not start too big, see 3).
3. Vit C definetly has ridicoulusly low risks in comparison to what most people here try to dampen their WDS with, but not zero.

Apparently, diarrhea is the point where you know you're taking a bit too much.

If you take too much for too long, kidney stones apparently haven't been unheard of. Do your own research and drink a lot of water with it.

There are many studies about this - originally, I posted some of them in this, but the thread then gets auto-deleted.... so just google Opiod WD + Vit C for yourself!

Well,  I started tapering down at the start of October, from 4g x 3 per day to 3g x 3 per day.  I've taken my time, as I am now just getting down to 1g x 3 per day, but this past week (after being at 6gpd for a few days), I've developed some pretty severe anxiety that comes in waves.  I didn't really notice this at all until recently, and I've also developed a twitch in my lower eyelid, which I read can be caused by anxiety, but it's also giving me anxiety; go figure.

I've had issues with PAWS in the past, as I was a heavy drinker for many years and quit 2 years ago.  

I'm also a fairly heavy cannabis smoker; although I gave that up for a year when I also gave up booze 2 years ago, thinking it was causing my anxiety.  Has anyone had to lay off cannabis during a kratom taper due to it inducing anxiety?  I guess I'm not really sure what I'm asking here.",7

Finally 6 weeks.,"I just wanted to post to give someone some hope when they’re in the shit of WD. I haven’t thought about kratom or withdrawal in days, maybe even a week now I’m so back to normal. At the beginning of WD I had forgotten what normal was and was in a swirling never ending sea of panic, anxiety, weird pains and sensations. It seemed to last forever. But somethings different this week. It’s almost like I’m more “normal” than I was before I even started kratom. I started doing my Olympic weightlifting again this week for the first time in 5 years, I’ve gone on so many little trips with my best friend full of unstoppable giggles and loud music, I took my 1.5 year old daughter out to eat in a restaurant for the first time almost since she was born. I’m smiling at the feeling of cold wind on my skin and driving with my windows down. I’m waking up with energy and not snoozing my alarm 5+ times. I’m eating without thinking “this might mess my dose up, better wait” and putting effort into how I look again. I can’t believe my hair looks fuller and I have baby hairs already. All of this to say, please don’t give up. There truly is such a beautiful light at the end of the tunnel. I had no idea what I was getting into when I quit, I didn’t know there were even withdrawals so it was like a swift kick to the face when they started. I don’t know how I could have done it without this sub. Don’t give up, push through and you will be okay. You can do this. If I can do it after all the shit I’ve abused and quit, anyone can.",11

It appears much thicker, but will hair density ever truly recover? 22 male","I have good genetics in this department. My grandfather is in his 70s, his hairline hasn't receded and is still mostly brown with only a few gray spots. My father is like this too so far. Other side of family has decent older hair too that hasn't fallen out. 

Anyway, will the density of hair follicles on the scalp make a recovery? My hairline hasn't receded, I just noticed that I could see into my scalp a little bit in the later stages of my 18 months of heavy kratom use. I've been taking biotin and eating lots of leafy greens, etc since I noticed it about 8 months ago.",6

I have been taking 10mg powder P/D plus 7 or 8 fresh leaves for 30 days (I live in Thailand).  My first ever experience with Kratom.  I want to quit tomorow but I am anxious about the WD's.  I am an ex tramadol addict - I used to take between 35-50 x 50mg trams per day on and off for 10 years and have done CT WD's off them many times, which is mind blowingly hard but I got through each one.  The last few WD's were very, very tough and the final one put me in hospital a couple times over a week.  Im getting older (48M) and I just dont think I have a CT WD of that level left in me.  I honestly think another CT WD of that scale will tip me over the edge.

I am hoping however that 15-20MG kratom each day for 30 days is not a particular high dose, and the WD will not be too bad?  The Tramadol abuse was about as high as it can get before dying, trust me 35-50 pills per day is INCREDIBLY high abuse.  Most serious tramadol addicts would take 6-10 pills per day.  My kratom consumption by comparison hopefuly is more low end?

I keep telling myself ""you got this - you have CT tramadol many times, you are an expert at WD"" but another part of me is saying ""your damaged, this CT could send you over the edge!""",3
