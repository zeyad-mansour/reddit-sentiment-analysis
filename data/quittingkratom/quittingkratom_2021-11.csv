I've tried and failed. Thinking about quitting kratom feels like I'm losing someone I love. I never thought I'd be here but I am.

I can't escape the desire to feel the buzz. I'll lower my dose to just maintenance for a few days and then get right back to my usual doses. I'll actually be excited about my lowered tolerance. 

It's like there's 2 sides of me: one that wants to quit and get my life back and another that is desperately holding onto this substance at all costs. 

I've tried cold turkey. This was a complete failure. I've tried tapering. It worked better than CT but I still end up going for the buzz again.

2021-11-29 17:30:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/r57i70/sober_living_bad_feelings_at_night/,Sober Living- Bad Feelings at Night,"Today is day 10 for me CT. I realized just now that since I didn’t immediately turn to binge drinking this time around, this might be the longest I’ve been sober in the last 5-7 years. I’m actually getting really tired of hurting my body. I’ve been treating it like shit for the last 15 years and expecting it to perform tip top for me. 

I realized and remembered that I have a really hard time in the evenings. What do sober people do at night? I get this feeling which is hard to describe but I’ll try. During the acutes everything sucks so nighttime sucking is expected but now that I am feeling much better physically, this hit me head first. 

The feeling is like a feeling of something or everything being not right/ not okay, mixed with boredome, mixed with not feeling at ease and safe and chill and happy, mixed with lonliness and some anxiety. I used to get this feeling all the time as a child and teenager. I’d freak out at bedtime as a little kid. I’m sure there were good nights but right now I can only remember this feeling. I think of it as the after dinner or dinner feeling. I always hated dinnertime partially because of this feeling. Honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if I have food allergies and this is just an allergic reaction everytime I eat or something. 

I always turned to Kratom or alcohol I think in an effort to run away from this feeling. The bads are too severe so I don’t want to go back and I’m not romanticising it but Kratom did always do an amazing job of making me actually enjoy my evenings. I never had these feelings on it. I always felt like things were more or less fine. Alcohol could blur out this feeling for several hours if I got drunk enough, but I would pay in feeling shitty other ways in middle of night or morning and overall deteriorating health. 

If you read all this, what do you think is going on here? Is it just anxiety? Do you guys get feelings like this? Is it normal? Do sober people feel better than this at night? Now that I am actually an adult my mind is starting to recognize shit like this more and in a way it’s harder to deal with. I know eventually the bad feelings will go away at some point, but it kind of really sucks never feeling good at night. 

Another part of me thinks our societal living is kind of fucked up and that’s why I feel isolated and scared at night. When we lived in tribes we would settle in with each other and band together at night, wind down, and sleep together. Now, everyone is so separated, even in families people sleep in their own rooms. Could it simply be this? 

I know I need to just accept the feelings since they’ve been there since childhood it probably isn’t going away. I miss being able to enjoy the evening and watch to look forward to bed time and watching tv before bed again. The days right now are get up, work, be bored at work, come home. Be bored and feel shitty. Try to go to bed and not sleep. Do it all over again. Shit kind of not fun at all.",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.64537543}"

Its much harder in a psychological aspect, as im not getting nearly as physically sick from wds. But psychologically it has been a whoooole different battle. My life is in a much better place than when i initially quit a year ago, but i never changed the behaviors that i have known since and before then that I need to change. And this quit is difficult, im on day 3 today, and im finding myself frustrated because there are so many things that i could do and want to do on kratom, but dont because im just sitting around high thinking about it. But right now in withdrawal, it feels so hard to get up and to actually start doing something, and when i do, i get distracted really fast and find myself staring at the wall or at my phone again. 

But today I made a list of all the things i can possibly think that I want to do, and to be honest its pretty fucking long. And i realized, that i do pretty much none of this when im using kratom or drinking heavily, and even now as im sitting around my house on my day off feeling shitty and lonely, ive been doing exactly what i want to stop doing, and im never gonna really feel better and get on with my life if i dont get off my ass and start just DOING STUFF

That is i think the biggest thing kratom has taken from me. That and alcohol allow me to do nothing but watch stupid TV and youtube and text my friends and work and be okay with a life like that living with my parents. But in a month im going to be on my own, and I have to have a clear mind. If i keep taking kratom, im only gonna have more and more excuses to postpone withdrawal, so here we go i guess. I love you all and thank you for being here.

However about a month in I have lost a large portion of sensitivity and I almost struggle to get fully erect during sex.

Started off with major depression and anhedonia from Days 1-20 with major insomnia. Days 20-33 were good, started feeling like myself again. Days 33-38 the depression and anhedonia returned. Days 38-45 were OK. Got a sinus infection around that time and started Prednisone on about Day 50 or so and the depression / anhedonia of the 1st 20 days returned with a vengeance. Stopped taking the Prednisone suddenly at the advisement of Docs and went through a shit week of terrible sleep (waking up with adrenaline starts as suddenly as I would fall asleep repetitively all night).  The Thanksgiving holiday was ok with sleep and I also felt ok as long as I was busy. Last night the lack of sleep returned with a vengeance, the same shit - fall asleep for 1-10 minutes then suddenly I'm jerked awake. Its maddening.

Depression runs in my family pretty heavily, mom and dad both have it. Alot of aunts/uncles/cousins have it too.

I am concerned that I have really fucked my brain up with my kratom use - I had a 1 year stint of 10 grams per day, went CT and went through about a month of major depression (which corrected) and quit almost a year then pandemic hit and I got back on it for a 9 month stint as 10-15 g/day. I cant help but think that the kratom actually masked true depression that I already have, given the family history. 

Doesn't help that I went to a doc last week and AIC and blood sugar were high, including elevated liver enzymes. 

I'm just a big huge mess here at 66 days Kratom free - when I feel that I should be getting out of the woods. My psych and therapist want me to start taking Buspar for my anxiety and I'm sure SSRIs are next. I don't want to take these meds if I am just going through a kratom WD process and my brain will eventually equal out. It did last time I quit....

I started using a year ago, and in that year, I’ve stopped and started six or seven times, often getting a month and starting again.

I guess that the real accomplishment that I’m trying to share is that I woke up this morning obviously sore and feeling like shit, but instead of thinking “I need kratom more than anything else in the world right now, get me some kratom at any cost” I thought to myself “I’m totally ready to face a day of withdrawals.” This is a big deal to me because for the past few days I realized that I’m absolutely ready to be done with this addiction, that after four years I’m ready to quit, but I was ON KRATOM while having those thoughts. It’s so easy to feel motivated to quit while actively taking kratom, but maintaining that motivation while withdrawing is the hard part. In my experience anyways. So I’m very happy that I still feel motivated. 


I know that I still have to face the hardest part of withdrawals over the next two or three days. The flu like symptoms have already kicked in for me (I get them after six hours of no use because I was dosing literally every hour) but I’m feeling confident in my ability to handle them even when they grow in intensity.

The reason for that is because if you are incapacitated, you can't help anybody else. Take care of yourselves. Be kind to yourselves. Strive. Drive. Be better than yesterday. Every day. Push yourself just a little further every time and those small differences will add up.

Usage fluctuated between 9-18g/day (almost always on the low end, aside from two bad flares of neck pain). I've briefly quit a few times, but always went back when pain started flaring.

I knew probably a year ago that kratom was starting to have a bad effect on my body--worsening deficiencies I already had--but I was hurting so bad that I couldn't bring myself to quit, even though I knew it was making things worse in the long run. I did a reaaaally long taper and was almost ready to jump just a few months ago, but a back flare stopped me and I went back up to my usual dosage. However, my stomach finally made the decision for me--I believe I have an ulcer (could be gastritis, but based on symptoms, I don't think so), and I believe it was brought on by kratom.

Since the beginning, kratom has always made me feel hungry within 15 minutes of taking it. So many things drop my blood sugar that it never occurred to me that it could be stomach irritation. But after my severe stomach pain leveled off, the feeling turned into something that mimicked hunger, and it suddenly hit me...holy shit, it's been irritating my stomach this entire time. So I switched to tea, which didn't eliminate the problem but did help a lot, and did a slow taper. Finished four days ago with no issues!

This is the week I jump!

Seriously wondered if I would ever get here! 

Even though I’m about to be “free”, I’ve been a functional addict on various different substances for 10 years now including Kratom (2018-present), oxycodone (3 months in 2016), Modafinil (on and off for the past 2-3 years), Tramadol (2010-2011) Xanax (2013-quit about 3 months ago). Oddly enough alcohol and weed are not things I’ve ever had much interest in (thank God!)

I clearly have a desire to medicate for a variety of reasons, some of which I’m conscious of (some anxiety, some social anxiety, wanting to “get an edge”) and some of which I’m not conscious of.  I know this: It’s likely a matter of time that i find something else or jump back in to something unless i figure this shit out and deal with it.

TWO questions:

1. I have an opportunity to go into a high-end addiction recovery facility for 6 weeks. Should i do this OR should I just do outpatient? 

2. What supplements should I start taking immediately to help ward off the inevitable psychological issues I’m going to be dealing with post-Kratom?

History: I have been on Kratom for over 5 years . At my peak I was taking 5 liquid extract shots per day which I believe equates to 70GPD. A year ago I cut back to 4 shots and a month ago I cut my daily usage in half by taking half of a shot, x4 per day. I had zero negative effects which was surprising. 

I have started tapering even more to 1/4 of a shot or x2 shots per day with zero negative effect. I have tried going without but only make it about 6-8 hours before the crap hits the fan. 

I would like to try mega dosing Vitamin C. I take 60mg of Vyvanse per day for ADHD which for me is absolute hell without the medication. I am very disciplined with Vyvanse and even take “holidays” for a few days every month to keep it in check. One thing I notice is that when I’m not taking Vyvanse, my W/D symptoms if I go awhile between doses are much more apparent. With Vyvanse, I don’t feel it nearly as much. 

As someone who’s taken it for awhile now, I am concerned how Mega Dosing VitC will affect my Vyvanse medication. I have read that it can significantly impact its efficacy. I am not at all against stopping the Vyvanse entirely during the W/D process but am hoping to avoid that. Maybe I’m being overly optimistic but figured it’s worth a shot to ask.

I’m late 40’s in age and quit CT in 2017 after a year and a half daily habit of between 10-20gpd plain leaf. I Experimented with Kratom off and on since 2007. I never experienced withdrawals until that last lengthy stint. Quitting was one of the worst and best things I ever dealt with. Accutes and PAWS was seriously messed up and lasted a long time for me. But, the experience led me to never taking that stuff again and committing to quitting other things (alcohol and cannabis). I’ve been 100% sober for almost 3 years.

How did you manage this? Any comments are greatly appreciated.","Heads Up: I know this is long so bear with me, no TLDR will be provided (too difficult to explain so shortly). 

Good morning everyone, 

I have tried quitting kratom so many times ive lost count. In my opinion the absolute worst part of withdrawals is this restless feeling at night, your brain seems to just say ""no dude, not tonight"" even though you are dozing off, you still cant sleep. 

Something that a portion of people get when going through withdrawals is this jerking/twitching restlessness and the most frustrating part about it, these always occur the minute you decide you want to get to bed and get some much-needed rest for your recovery.

So here are some of my questions, and trust me, I have tried my best to find these answers on this sub as well as elsewhere before resorting to making this post (Ill try to be as quick and concise as possible):

First Question:

As soon as I want to sleep, I get this feeling in my chest. When I feel this sensation in my chest, I know that the jerking is on its way and I may not get any sleep at all, 30 minutes to 90 minutes if Im lucky. However, unlike hypnic and myoclonic jerks, these jerks feel voluntary to me. So heres what happens, I lay down, get this sensation in my chest (like an anxious feeling), and to relieve this feeling in my chest I begin to jerk and the sensation is relieved, but only for a minute at most. Can anyone relate to this? If so itd bring me comfort just to know im not alone.

Second Question:

If you have had this type of feeling while trying to get some rest, what did you do to help remedy this feeling? Did you even have success trying to remedy this, or did you simply slug it out? 

Third Question:

How good does it feel to be kicking your demons ass and having this great support network online? 

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and thank you ahead of time if you commented. You guys really are awesome and I think its beautiful what you guys have created here, take care, and best of luck to all of you.

Also if this is what is happening, should I avoid alcohol permanently or will this get better the longer I stay off kratom?",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.76652765}"

I want my emotion back. I can't write music or write stories anymore. My creativity is gone. It's ruling and ruining my life!

I was a heroin addict. Quit with suboxone, which ended up even harder to quit. Then I remained sober for about a year, and then was introduced to kratom. I thought, ""I found a loophole,"" as I am sure all of you thought too. 

I kept telling myself ""it's legal, it's only as addictive as coffee, and it's harmless."" But anything that puts you in a debilitating withdrawal is not ""harmless."" 

I have been dope sick, and I am sure kratom WD is not as bad, and yet I am terrified to quit. I keep looking for a magical OTC recipe, but none seem to exist. People say kava helps, while others say it makes it worse. Some say lopermide. Stem and vein. 

I have a lot of responsibility, so to be out of commission even for a day is bad. I don't know where to begin. Perhaps I should go cold turkey and ""man-up"" but no matter what I should do, I am terrified.

Thank you all.

Update: Sunday I micro dosed coming down from over 60 grams a day. I did a quarter of a teaspoon breakfast lunch and dinner (time wise--didn't eat) and got a lot of the sweating out. I used a white strain instead of my usual green malay. I had a real sleep for the first time in 2 years. But...

Today I woke up feeling like poop with a migraine. I dropped the kid off at school, grabbed coffee for my wife, and brought her to work, and came home and got busy doing my work. I was dying though. So...I hit up the doctor and got a script of gabapentin (as everyone has told me to do). It was actually quite easy to get. That and IB 800 for migraines. 

Right now I feel AMAZING and I wrote a song for the first time in 2 years. Here's my formula:

Gabapentin 100-300  (1)
St. Johns (2)
L-Theanine 100 mg (1)
5-HTP 100mg (1)

I started in February. I have been on and off with this stuff for 12 years, after being sent a sample at 16 and not knowing what it was. The last time I quit it, I thought I would kill myself if I didn't. It was a 4 and a half year stint of using 50gpd, waking up during the night to take it to avoid withdrawal, but needing to work to live so I was honestly contemplating suicide. I said, never again. I quit, I vowed never again.

&#x200B;

Then, I had a seizure and broke my tailbone and had a spinal injury. This was around COVID, and no doctors would take a serious look at me. I lost my mind with pain and was at a point of absolutely being suicidal again because the pain was too much to bear but nobody was listening to me. In fact, they were judging me because I was so erratic at that point, I couldn't verbalise myself properly. I decided to go back onto kratom, not because I wanted to, I felt I had to.

&#x200B;

So, the pain has resided a little bit, it will never be gone as I didn't have the procedures I needed to fix my spinal problems (I have a bad doctor) and my tailbone is pretty much fractured or something forever. Woo. Anyways, I keep putting off tapering. I went through so much hell last year, I don't even know if I want to feel again. However, the withdrawal i'm experiencing in between doses isn't worth it. I keep saying, tomorrow I'll do a taper. Tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow. I am afraid i'll have to go back to work soon and end up in the same loop I used to be stuck in, needing time off work to quit it but not being able to get it. I need motivation to start this today, the taper. Please outline how much better you feel off of it, I honestly don't remember what good feels like and that's the biggest issue here.

Screw what everyone says, it is really hard to get out it the kratom use cycle. 

I started taking kratom ~ November of 2019. I noticed this weird green substance I've never seen before, and supposedly it helped with anxiety / depression / relaxing after a hard day. 
I've always been super active, and I am a VERY achieved powerlifter before 2019. I was physically getting myself to a limit that far few people achieve within their lifetimes, and I was only 17 when I was there. 

When I first took kratom, I didn't feel anything (as many people don't), then I just kept taking it as I wanted to see if I could get the benefits at some point. After a couple weeks I felt it, and when I started taking at work holy cow was I able to talk to people so much easier. My boss even acknowledged that my social skills dramatically improved. Part of the reason I took kratom is because I had two really toxic and annoying coworkers who would constantly make my life a living hell when I messed up, and this went on for many months. I just kept taking kratom, more and more. Oh, one more dose won't hurt after lunch. Oh, one more dose when I get home from work to wind down. Oh, the kratom makes me feel a bit tired so I think I'm just gonna skip working out and do it tomorrow when I have more energy. 
The thing is, the cycle repeats. I kept taking more. And more. Trying different strains. Doing it first thing on the weekend fasted so I could feel it more. I lost about 15 lbs of muscle after only four months since kratom made me lose my drive for working out (fuck, I hate that now.). 
I continued on until March this year. Met a beautiful woman. Took multiple 4 hour bus trips to see her. For some reason because I was falling in love I stopped taking kratom because for once, this other person depended on me to be strong and I knew that kratom was stopping that. 
Fast forward two months, and she's out of the picture because of personal reasons. All the sudden I'm left with a heartbreak. Weirdly enough that nudged me to get back into the gym, and hell I did some crazy shit again and was almost 160lbs from 135 I let myself get to. 

I was also three months clean at that point, so my body had long forgotten what kratom was. So I stupidly decided one day to just take like 4 capsules, and all the sudden the workouts don't seem as fun as kratom, video games, weed, and ordering takeout on the daily. It felt so good, or that's what this substance made me believe. 
I stopped working out AGAIN, and found myself in the SAME slump I was in before. I didn't do any chores. I found no pleasure in doing anything but kratom. God, that was a low I thought I'd never get to again. I started taking extracts and holy shit, an OPMS black literally made me feel so happy Everytime I took it. I took extracts multiple times a week even though my bank account was getting shit on by my bad habits. My stomach completely got fucked and the water I was drinking felt like it wasn't even being absorbed, and the food I was eating was getting blocked up in my gut. I swear to God if you took my intestines out and cut them open you'd find a green sludge inside that was sticking itself to my intestines. 

Now, it's been over 6.8 months since I started again. I feel like I fucking blinked and I was back in the hellhole I was in before. I still worked out at least a little bit so I'm still pretty fit, but I'm over this. I'm over this lie that I tell myself ""just one more day"". I'm sick of living in fucking filth and finding it acceptable as long as I dosed high enough. I wish kratom was illegal as this substance can absolutely cause horrendous things to happen to your personality. I'm not even a quarter as strong as I once was mentally,.physically, and spiritually. I used to not even take drugs back in 2018 other than the joint here and there. If I took myself back then, and showed him who I was today he'd be pretty pissed off. 

Stop now, before it's too late. I'm currently on day one of a long journey. I know that this substance isn't good for me. I'm not going to be in denial any longer. I need my strength back. I need my divinity back. I need my conscious voice to guide me back to my authentic self. I pray for everyone here that they quit, and never look back. This plant isn't worth trading for a real life with real relationships and real health, not just a fake sense of well being even though your physical reality is completely shit and fucked up beyond belief.

I didn't think it was possible. 6 years as a multiple dose daily user, more quit attempts and relapses that I can count, and for the first time I truly feel free of it.

And it feels good. I just wanted to make a quick post about it here, as this community helped make it possible for me. Reading everyone else's struggles to shake the stuff, their triumphs and failures, everyone's journeys, it gave me the strength to keep trying. And I think it's finally stuck. And I'm proud of myself, which is not something I think I ever felt on Kratom.

I also wanted to give my thoughts and advice as a long term user and (so far) successful abstainer. Here they are in no particular order:

1. **Relapsing doesn't make you a failure, it just shows you need to change something else to quit successfully:** I hear a lot of talk on here about different quitting methods (CT, tapers, supplements, prescriptions, etc.). While those can be important, there are so many internal factors that I believe are much more important. For me, it was asking myself ""what am I running away from and using kratom to avoid dealing with?"". For me, it was a number of factors, but the biggest was truly hating my job, some difficult money problems, not coming to terms with a failed relationship, and feeling as though I had abandoned and failed many of the people I care about. Once I started addressing some of those things, kratom just no longer made sense at a certain point. I started shedding all the reasons I had to run back to it, and so when the time finally came to walk away, I didn't look back. For a long time, I very much had the mindset of ""I need to quit kratom so I can deal with my bigger issues"", but it really truly was the other way around.
2. **Therapy was more than worth it for me:** If I had one recommendation for how to get through this successfully, it would be to start seeing a therapist if you aren't already (or make a change to your current therapist if it isn't working out). I know not everyone can afford a therapist (for me, I really had to make things stretch to make it work), but see if there are any low cost or sliding scale providers in your area. Talking through everything that's going on, and coming to terms with why you're choosing the drug over sobriety are so so helpful.
3. **A lot of those weird side effects did get better with time (but it did take time):** One of the big things that pushed me to quit was that I started to have these weird episodes where I would all of a sudden get light headed, my heart would start racing, and I felt like I was having a panic attack. It didn't start happening until a few years in, weirdly, but near the end of my use it was happening with more and more frequency. Now that I'm 200 days out, it doesn't happen at all. Such a relief. I have also stopped shedding hair at an alarming rate (which was happening on kratom). Now, has all of my hair that I lost grown back? Not yet, but it does definitely look fuller to me. Also, my libido has definitely bounced back, and sex is much better/easier without kratom in my system. I can get boners, don't lose them as often, and can have an orgasm without monumental effort. Win win. So if you're experiencing these symptoms, there's a good chance they will improve after quitting. Just know that most of them took a few months to really improve (for example, I think my libido was still terrible until like 3-4 months post-quit)
4. **Tapering worked best for me:** Like I said before, I think that the method of quitting is less important than what you change in between attempts, but for me a very gradual taper was what I used the time I finally shook it off. I was at about 20-25gpd (2-3 doses per day of about 8-10grams) when I decided to quit, and slowly started shaving off a grams or so at a time, to the point where I was only taking enough to trick my body into feeling something (like a gram or two at a time). I stayed at that tiny dose for like a week or two, then I jumped. I didn't feel too many intense withdrawal symptoms at that point, really just the insomnia, fatigue during the day, and some irritability. I didn't use any supplements other than black seed oil, but that did definitely seem to help with my withdrawal symptoms and cravings. That and exercise. Running, jogging, even walking. Get up, move around, drink some water. Journal. Work through your thoughts and cravings. Keep going
5. **Feeling euphoric is not the same as feeling good:** This is just something I realized on the way that helped guide me toward quitting. After being off the stuff for a few weeks, I started to feel good about things, but not euphoric (the way kratom made me feel). Sitting on the couch after my nightly dose, playing video games, eating whatever, with a stupid high smile on my face. Yeah, that light, smiley, ""high"" feeling... it's hard to beat (even talking about it is triggering a bit of craving). But after I quit, it slowly got replaced with something better. Now, I feel good. Not euphoric, but good. Being able to make time and commitment to see my baby nephew and watch him grow. That feels good, but not euphoric. Having conversations with friends where I can think clearly, listen, and respond thoughtfully feels good, but not euphoric. Taking control of my life through hard work and discipline feels good, but not euphoric. That specific kind of instant, on-demand euphoria was hard to give up for me, so hard. But losing it gave me the ability to feel real, lasting joy from watching things that I nurture grow and change. And right now, I don't think I ever want to let that feeling go.

I guess I had more thoughts than I realized. I hope some of that mess is helpful to someone. I just really want everyone who's struggling to know that it is possible to live beyond the fog and sludge that kratom has you trapped in. It does get better. I didn't believe it myself when I was deep into the addiction, but it's true. And treating addiction isn't permanent, it takes constant practice and effort. But it does get easier. I know it because I've experienced it.",54,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45523983}"

Day 1-3 CT: minimal sleep, RLS, anxious, still functioning(ish)

Day 4-5 CT: things got real. No sleep, maybe lightest sleep ever 30 mins - 1 hour. Wanted to give up. Took one capsule (wouldn’t recommend), no relief.  Wanting to crawl out of skin. Fatigue, pain, RLS, mentally taxed

Day 6 CT: Worst day yet, almost gave up. Only walking to showers/bath to pass an hour. Breaking point at 7p, crying  / asking about detox. Almost breaking point. Finally forced a walk outside and CBD for sleep. Slept 2 hours.

Day 7 CT: FINALLY! Life tolerable, forcing walks. Started feeling hope. 

Day 8-10 CT: Slowly better everyday!! Force walks, get out of head, follow suggestions on this thread. Journal may help see progress. Sleep improving to 4-5 hours / day.

Day 11 CT: Able to be with family on thanksgiving!! Still felt lousy but so much progress! 

Day 12 CT: 6 hours sleep last night. Dreaming when woke up to pee, must be deeper sleep. Feels like joining the world again.

There is hope, like so many here say - just keep pushing, don’t look back, remember the pain is a path to a new life. Use tools: force walking, music, yoga, showers, talk to a loved one, have a support person, get honest, no matter what just keep pushing. Seems like it gets better right at worst moment.

Join a recovery group! Realize everything is raw, anything covering up with use may come back hard at first, pain is progress, don’t forget how far you’ve come.

There’s hope all. There is hope! I’ll be spreading the word about this experience with a “harmless plant”. 

Thank you to everyone here, forum is a God send.

I then had a lot of stress going on and fell back into taking it because it's so available. 

I'd been taking 6-10 grams daily of mostly white kratom powder, sometimes using capsules.

For around the past week, I have been taking less and even have taken small doses of naltrexone to try and force myself off of it (i dont recommend doing this unless you want to feel like you're dying). 

The last weekish I've taken between 4-6 grams each day with a few days being the days i also took naltrexone. 

Am I better off going CT and getting through it? I haven't been on it long or on very high of a dose so I feel like I'm just prolonging my suffering right now. 

The main reason i havent gone ct already is that work was hell the one day I tried going ct so ive been taking small doses when I work. 

Any suggestions/personal experiences? I can't call off of work for a few days, im a server and it's the start of season here. 

I take prescribed valium for anxiety which does help, but i have a nicotine and caffeine habit that obviously do not help.

I live across the street from a smoke shop and they know me extremely well and give me discounts left and right.  That def doesn't make it fucking easy! Also,  Pretty much most of my twenties I took Vicodin on and off for years. And drank. Pretty sure my liver is fucked.

Anyways, I got a DUI 5 years ago and was put on probation, started taking Kratom because I couldn't do anything else. Quit when I got off probation, honestly didn't really notice withdrawals because I was so excited to get back to normal life.

Started again randomly about 6 months later. took it on a shitty day at the gym when I threw my back out pretty bad, and have basically been back at it since.

I'm on day 3 and I've only take 2-3 regular caps a day for gastro intestinal stuff. Which in my opinion is the worst, constantly feeling like you have to take a shit even when I don't have to is pretty fun. Luckily I was able to have a doctor prescribe my hydroxyzine which I took one yesterday and one the day before to deal with anxiety. Didn't not take that today. It helps, feels like a weak Xanax. I work be taking it unless absolutely necessary for anxiety/sleep.

First day was awful, could barely take the dog for a walk or get off the couch. Took two melatonin to get some sleep and just rolled around uncomfortably all night. Yesterday was slightly better but still pretty bad. I felt like I was at 20% capacity. And my back is fucking going nuts. I think the hardest part going forward is pain management without the Kratom, and figuring out what to do with my back. 

But today (day 3) I feel MUCH BETTER. I know I have a long road ahead but just getting to this point feels huge for me. And honestly kicking this compared to kicking Vicodin is much easier, but the hardest part for me is not coming back, and living without the crutch of opiates. And to anyone reading this, KRATOM IS THE SAME FUCKING GARBAGE. It's not the wonder drug you think it is at first. I wouldn't recommend it to literally anyone, Even my friends that have no addictive qualities. This shit hooks you fast and fucks with your brain chemistry.

I'm tired, withdrawing and haven't even made it a few weeks yet. I don't want to use, but the mood swings and cravings are real. The extra pressure to ""enjoy the holidays"" kinda sucks. Not sure if anyone else is feeling this way.

I'm just glad that the day is moving forward and tomorrow I have as much rest and relax as I want. Sleep for 3 hrs cooking since 8am. And no drink or anything else.

I've tried a few times and failed but this time I am going to face the pain and push through it. My first day I started cold sweating aches all over my body and restless legs to the point I couldn't sit still. I started taking kratom to help with my shoulder pain I've had 3 shoulder surgeries. It was pretty horrible. You all know how it is. But I went to the doctor and got 800 mg gabapentin and was told to take half whenever I started getting symptoms and I have felt normal.

                                         Update
So I stopped taking the gabapentin, I only took them for four days to stop the major withdrawals at the beginning and it seems to have worked for me. I was only prescribed 10 of them. I still had 3 left. I feel great except for a lack of energy but I can push through that and it will return in time. A few people were saying it's worse than kratom itself, just dont overdo it if you go this route it's not meant to be your new drug just something to ease to restless leg syndrome if that is what is bothering you the most. For me I cant stand laying awake at night and running around the house because the pain in my legs is unbearable. I'm 100 percent sure I beat it this time. I'll post an update again in about a week",8,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43640965}"

But not gonna stress it until im free from kratom 2 weeks.

Since I can’t sleep I’m going to write up my battle with these two villains during my withdrawals. Feel free to comment thoughts or suggestions. 

I CT off 60-80gpd and am going into day 6. Through the worst now however the rls and insomnia is actually bothering me worse these last two nights. Quite hellish as you all know. Here are my attempts to fight these along with their percieced efficacy. You might get a laugh out of some of them because they’re stupid but you can relate. 

Long hot shower- by far the best method so far. Provides about 40minutes to an hour of relief. Sometimes can be the catalyst to falling asleep but not tonight. Also annoying to do multiple times at late hours. 

Hylands restless legs- maybe helps maybe doesn’t. If anything gives a little psychological boost like maybe it will work. 

Calm restless legs daily formula- take two pills between evening meal and bedtime. Unsure of whether this is helping. First time trying it and thought it was helping but not the last two nights. The bottle says it should work within a few weeks lol. 

Black seed oil- usually helps ease all symptoms during acutes. Unsure of whether it was helping at all this time in general. Might provide a psychological boost when taken. 

Masturbation- I’d rather avoid this but I’ll do anything to get relief. Provides about 20 minutes of relief consistently. Not enough to get me asleep tonight. 

Stretching- I thought I found the holy grail when stretching my legs and my glutes the third and fourth night seemed to provide massive relief. Sadly it’s not helping as much now. Provides maybe 1-5 minutes of relief. 

Body massage- helps marginally as something to do other than tossing and turning. Tension seems to come back pretty fast though. 

Slapping myself as hard as possible- This is generally out of frustration and desperation and I don’t recommend people start hurting themselves, however in dire circumstances the pain can be a nice vacation from the rls. 

Magnesium Powder (Calm)- I think this does help a little in general taken near or at bedtime. 

Valerian- Seems to maybe help fall asleep. Not working last two nights. 

Weed (indica or hybrid)- best to avoid if you have a problem with it, but I don’t due to it generally giving me anxiety. I had some lying around so I’m giving it a go. Taking a small baby hit maybe every 10 minutes or so. Seems to help take the edge off. Not sure how it would work if you just went full bong rip mode. Potential to be dangerous with anxiety. 

Eating something- I struggle with appetite during acutes, and my appetite is not fully back yet although I ate more today then the last 5 days combined so thats a good sign overall. I think having a decent meal so you aren’t trying to sleep on an empty stomach is a good move even if you have to force it a bit. Even just a small meal is good. Having an ice cream bar intermittently is nice when tossing and turning as a temporary comfort. 

Moving legs like a bicycle or doing muscle clenching exercises- kind of helps a little when really suffering. 1-5 minutes relief. Doesn’t provide any long lasting relief. 

peeing- peeing sometimes has a noticeable beneficial effect. I think the urinary system might be excreting harmfull metabolites still from kratom, or it’s just tied in somehow to the pathways. Same thing with masturbation for the pathways part. Those things were fucked up while on kratom, so it makes sense that they have a connecting to the healing process. Sometimes I get 5-10 minutes of relief after peeing. 

Getting up and walking around for a few minutes- 1-5 minutes of relief. 

Exercise/run during the day- I think this is a good move in general. I wen’t for my first run earlier after work and it felt great. Nothing conclusive on sleep. Probably beneficial. Not working right now. 

Wim Hof Breathing- helpful as something to do. Helpful with other withdrawal symptoms during acutes. Kind of seems to intensify the rls during the breath holds for me right now. Don’t know if I’d recommend for sleep. 

Deeper breathing/box breathing- Sometimes through the pain of rls I realize I’m not breathing properly. Slowing down and taking deep breaths seems to help reduce the rls. Nice and easy. Try to let the lungs fill like a balloon. Box breathing - 4 second inhale, 4 second hold, 4 second exhale, 4 second hold, repeat. Helpful and good exercise to focus the mind on. 

Watching tv- I’ve been trying to practice really good sleep hygeine this time, so I’ve been avoiding tv before bed like I usually enjoy. If you give up on sleep and don’t want to fight, go for it. Put on a show and let it occupy your attention. 

I think that’s mostly everything. If you guys have any better ideas to try I’d love to hear them. I expect the rls to go away within then next week or so. Sometimes it can come back towards a month out randomly which sucks. After this phase goes away I find that I start to sleep well again.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.42321578}"

It’s been a while since my last “Day 0” post.

I’m taking another crack at this tomorrow and I have a very, very good feeling about it.

As it stands now, I usually “quit” every Friday night, have 2 days of WD over the weekend and then relapse on Monday. This has been the case for years now.

I didn’t even try and quit last weekend because I didn’t feel like going through the WDs.

I’ll be with family/etc all throughout this week and won’t have the opportunity to get more.

This puts me at 4 full days until I have to stare kratom in the face and say “no”. It won’t put me completely out of acutes but I’ll definitely be in a better spot physically on Monday.

I plan on exercising, journaling, wim hof breathing, meditating, praying, drinking plenty of water, moderate cannibas use, not drinking and seeking/providing support on this sub.

I went to one of the bi weekly online support meetings (which I highly recommend)fairly recently and someone mentioned that “When it’s your time you’ll know”

It’s my time now….I can feel it. I’m ready to shed this shell of a person I’ve become and start being the real me.

I’m tired of talking/thinking about my desire to quit and to start talking about how my life has changed since I’ve quit.

I know what I’m in for in terms of WDs tomorrow. As a matter of fact, they will probably be a little worse than normal since my usage has upticked and I didn’t do my standard two day break last week.

I also know that PAWs will come after next week.

This is fine….I’ve got to give the piper his dues…..and I owe him a lot. This being said I’m not going to pay him a penny more than I need to. (In other words, I’m going to let the physical pain be my punishment….I’m not going to punish myself by wallowing in shame)

Each lasting about 3 months, and each time separated by like 2 years. This time around my dosage has gotten way out of control and I’m spending too much money. Also I’m just sick to my stomach on it and especially when coming down. When I don’t take it I don’t experience much sickness so hopefully that’s a good sign. The fun is gone now. I’ve spent way more money than I wish to admit to myself on it and it’s time for me to stop. Also was using it to lose weight and motivate myself to get some goals done. I ended up gaining weight and getting nothing done. Excited to be my normal self again. Going CT tomorrow so pray for me. Thanks for this group, you all are great here.

Edit Update: First two days were fine, no difficult physical withdrawals really sometimes get hot flashes but I think that may be because I am dehydrated, once I drink water I’m good. Mentally a little anxious and bored. Not much motivation and some pain in my body but I think that’s because I wasn’t active/stretching. So basically just a result of not taking care of myself for three months. I was only on for three months but last day I was at 40GPD feeling nothing but sick.

Quitting really is the only sane option.","When I waver in my decision (as I know I'm going to in the next few weeks) I'm going to come back to this list: Maybe it will resonate with some of the good people lurking on this sub, debating whether it's worth taking the next step and quitting, or even just posting to look for some advice. I hope it's alright that I make such a self indulgent post here, and obv. my experience, and my reasons for quitting will be different than yours. But here we go! Some of the things I'm looking forward to are...

\- better sleep  
\- more persistence in creative endeavors and projects  
\- better able to maintain relationships w/ loved ones  
\- more passionate about my experiences of art and life  
\- more living in the moment  
\- more inspiration  
\- more freedom to choose what I do with my life  
\- less shame/ feeling as though I'm hiding my addiction from people  
\- better able to challenge myself  
\- can be a better friend and collaborator than I am now  
\- Able to grow and change into the person and artist I must be instead of staying stagnant.  
\- less monotony  
\- fewer regrets  
\- less hopelessness  
\- less isolation  
\- more able to face my struggles and emotions head-on instead of running from them  
\- better able to be honest with myself  
\- more thoughtful, more receptive to the inner voice  
\- more curious- more patient  
\- less trapped in other, seemingly never-ending, cycles of compulsive behavior  
\- more in control of my life  
\- Less suppressed appetite  
\- less nausea/ constipation  
\- Fewer eye issues, less acne  
\- More saved money that can be invested for my future.

That's all I can think of at the moment. I really recommend writing out something like this for yourself too if you're debating your next step... Somehow I was able to rationalize so many problems kratom was bringing to my life, but seeing all of these things together is really powerful. As I'm writing this, it occurs to me that part of the difficulty with this drug is that it's very possible for many of us to use it while still functioning at more than just a bare minimum level. So many of us can go to work, and can afford our rent, maintain proper hygiene, etc., and it might be that most people around us have no idea that anything is the matter. In other words, we might never hit a rock bottom with kratom the same way we might with other drugs. So maybe it's a mistake to be always waiting for the perfect moment to quit, since that may never come. Instead, maybe it would more helpful to frame it as, how will your life change for the better when you walk away from this stuff? When the withdrawals and PAWS are past, and it's finally loosened its grip on you? Thanks for reading.

My most recent takeaway after a weekend of socializing is when I was taking kratom, I truly believed I needed to take it before social events to enjoy myself. I don’t drink or use any other substances, so I always thought the kratom helped me feel more comfortable and socialize. However, I realize that was a lie. Whenever I’d take it and see people, as soon as it wore off I’d wanna go home. It hindered my plans, and got in the way of my connections. 

But this weekend, I was so present and I had a lot of fun. I was funnier and more aware of my emotions. And it felt so good to know that my excitement and interest was genuine. It wasn’t fueled by a substance. 

There’s still a lot of boredom and anhedonia but I know that’ll fade.

#**My Story**  

I was on a 150 gpd habit on a particularly potent powder i cant say in here since the mod wouldnt approve the other versions of this post.(Other strains stop working. Glad I didn't start taking the liquids. $20 a bottle is expensive) My tolerance was so high that I would take my regular 125 -150 gpd dose and still get withdrawals a couple hours later. Kratom ruined a couple years of my life. I had a great job making decent money, and bought my dream car I always wanted as a kid at age 20 (392 SRT Challenger), found a nice place to live etc. I was always independent, made my own money and took care of myself and my health. I was doing good for myself and my wife at a young age. (Yes I got married young). I found kratom like 2 years later just browsing on reddit and reading how great kratom is, and how you don't get addicted to it and it's safe to take. It started out wonderful, I felt like a new person, life seemed more enjoyable, simple things were fun. I loved it because it made me feel great without side effects. I stopped drinking alcohol and smoking bowls, I didn't even plan to stop doing other stuff I just stopped (I wasn't an alcoholic, but I drinked frequently but hated how I felt after drinking. Also never had alcohol withdrawals before) and like everyone else my dose was low, I was taking like 3 scoops daily at the max for a couple months, but then slowly but surely it kept increasing because of tolerance. 

Eventually after taking only kratom for 1.5-2yrs things started to go downhill. Kratom stopped working, the only dose that worked was the morning dose but after that wore off i felt terrible again, anything after that just made me feel worse. I started to become complacent, lazy, not getting stuff done, I stopped working out, stopped doing stuff I enjoyed like going out with friends, being creative, making business plans, making music and playing video games. I even quit my job because I started to get easily overwhelmed and couldn't handle stress or perform like I used to. I could handle stress like a champ in the past. I lost my car, got evicted out of the place i was living, so thats $3000 i have to pay back in collections. Marriage was going downhill, I was just a total wreck of a person. I had to force myself to leave the house to hang with friends or family. I couldn't function normally without kratom in my day to day life. I brought it with me everywhere. Family and friends didn't know I took it, only my wife, so I would sneak in the bathroom to take more without people knowing. I moved to another state and went back to school to start over. Before kratom I was very ambitious, I wanted to own my own business by now. After I got used to being lazy, that's when the health side effects started coming in bad. I was depressed daily, got panic attacks nearly everyday, even when I took a lot of kratom, and I had to get on depression and anxiety meds. My body started breaking down, My muscles stopped working properly, I had muscle cramps and spasms daily. I dislocated my shoulder for no reason, and it still hasn't healed till this day, it still pops out even when I do simple things. Probably going to have to get surgery. (Before I was on kratom I was a healthy person, never got sick, never had any health issues, and worked out consistently. Even when I would take a couple month break from working out I would still be almost at the same strength I left off at, but not on kratom, my muscle stopped working right). I would feel sick, sweating for no reason, and had constant headaches that nothing would help, not even tylenol or caffeine. Brain fog was at an all time high, I couldn't even do college homework or attend class anymore. It was like I was going through withdrawals dailey, even though I took my regular amount of kratom which was crazy to me. What made it worse was knowing the type of person I was before.

I always held myself to a high standard, grinding everyday to be better at anything i'm tryna accomplish, and achieve my goals, but kratom took that drive out of me and it made me feel hopeless, like will I ever be able to recover from this, or will I ever be my old self again. Addiction ruins families and relationships. My wife was getting fed up with my addiction problem and it put a lot of stress on her and ultimately damaged our marriage. Trying to scrape up any money I can find to get my next kratom dose even if it hurts us financially. I know I can recover and gain back things I've lost, but it kills me inside thinking about where I would be in life if I hadn't touched kratom. I screwed up my life so I had to quit somehow. I tried for several months to quit but failed. My breaking point was one day, I was physically and mentally feeling so bad I was planning to kill myself to end the pain. That's when I knew it was time to get help immediately. 

So I had my family take me to a detox center, called out of work for 7 days, and muscled through the withdrawals. They didn't even give me anything to help with the withdrawals.(Even though when I called and asked they said they would give Clonidine to help. I was so pissed off at the time) They didn't even give me anything to help with sleep, so I was up for days. The withdrawals were bad. No sleep, RLS all day, sweating and cold at the same time, shitting anything I ate, delirious, brain zaps, releasing fluids from every hole in my body, I was basically a zombie for 3.5 days. The bright side was that it wasn't that different from the feelings I had while on kratom, just more a sickly my body is fighting something type feeling. I'm glad they didn't give me any subs while I was there even tho I did want something for relief, but I'm glad cause I don't need anything new to get addicted too. Day 5 is when it started to get better, I still was out of it mentally and my body felt like it just got out of a battle, even though I was sitting or laying down the entire time. Day 7 once I got out was even better, still had RLS at night but no physical withdrawals. Day 10 I was able to get like 4hr of sleep, but no RLS  (At day 7 I started taking supplements to help with RLS). I definitely feel better now, I'm still struggling with tiredness, motivation, sleep, anxiety and doing simple things. I hear it gets better after your brain heals, but I'm just taking it one day at a time. 

Just like me, people are just scared to just quit, and it's holding them back. I wish I did it sooner. Kratom WD won't kill you so you'll be fine. Withdrawals will be over quicker if you CT. Tapering just makes the withdrawals last longer. It's difficult to develop and stick with a taper plan and it makes you anxious taking less, causing you to take a little bit more without realizing it, dragging out the process and spending more money. I see people here recommending tapering or CT, and I've tried both and CT was more effective. The withdrawals will be similar, CT will be tough but not by much and will be shorter. The thing is you will still feel the withdrawals if you taper, you will just be toying with yourself for months, being in the habit of putting the slugg in your mouth but still feeling like crap. The faster it's out of your system the better.


If you're new to kratom don't be fooled by all the people in other forums saying ""it's a miracle drug"", ""it's ok to take"", ""it's not as bad as other opiates"", and ""withdrawals aren't that bad if you want to quit at any time"". No kratom is just as bad as any other opioid, it hits the same receptors in your brain. The difference is that it's extremely difficult to overdose like other pills because kratom has a limit to how strong it can get, but the withdrawals are basically the same, and who knows what else is in it. We're just taking a risk putting stuff in our body just to feel good temporarily, then once it's over we are overloaded with the consequences of feeling so good, which is feeling like shit. I had my fair share of substances and nothing made me feel this bad or had me stuck like kratom did. Not pills, not adderall, not weed, not even drinking. (Alcohol withdrawals are a lot more dangerous if you're an alcoholic). I never felt dependent on those and I could quit at any time. If anyone is reading this you can do it, don't give up and get kratom out of your life as fast as possible so we can all recover and take our lives back. Don't let substances control you, we gotta put them in their place.

Parked at the entrance furthest from Gamestop just to get some extra walking in. Had to make a return, and grabbed a couple games that are on sale now as well. Irritability kicked up a bit when I was getting the typical upselling spiel from the person at Gamestop, but I know they're paid to do that and I remined polite. Usually I have a ton of patience and even internally I don't get irritated, so I'm not sure if that's because of WD or because I was kind of hyping up/thinking I was going to feel these ways.

I jumped onto two different ""mild"" opioids as I have rocked a 12-15gpd for 3 months now, and i had stopped before remembering the wd's as awfull.

I did one of these mild opioids for 4 days then 1 days break then the other one for 5 days and now I am here today on day 2 with nothing in the system, and i feel awful - Even worse than just quitting Kratom so big advice DONT DO THAT it will only make it worse.

This community is great.  Thanks to everyone contributing here, the good the bad and the ugly are all good for us to be reminded of I think.  
I've been lurking around here for I dunno, a while. posted a couple comments but haven't piped up.  


I put the hard opiates down maybe 4 years ago, and have been on and off dependent on Kratom since then.  And on and off convincing myself I was ""clean"" on and off those runs of K use.  

Today was day 15 of this most recent quit and... I'm feeling pretty good

things feel a little different this time.  I have some real world Why's for quitting this time, and I am actually trying to learn a real program of recovery, instead of using one I tell myself I'm smart enough to figure out on my own.  I'm fuckin not  
Used all the advice I saw on here, and all the supplements.  That all helped with the acutes but THE MOST helpful thing so far has been the WHM, breathing, cold exposure.  It is a guilt free high that truly brings you deeper into yourself.  Into your somatic experience in a peaceful way, no matter where you were before.

IF YOU ARE IN ACUTES (or PAWS) (or LIFE) AND STRUGGLING, TRY WIM HOF.  


Tonight I found a bag of capsules, probably 25g.    
I put them back, did the breathing practice, then took them to the trash bin on the curb.  And for the first of many times I've discarded drugs, I am not even remotely concerned I might go try to recover them.  

Anyway there's fucking hard moments still, but overall things are improving and I'm just really fucking grateful for that.  And I owe it in large part to you guys!

My amazing, incredible dog gives me comfort and ensures that I HAVE to get outside and move, but hoping I'll be able to find motivation to go running or to the gym. I'm tired of this cycle. I hate who I've become. I don't feel like I'm a totally different person, I don't feel like I'm drowning, I just feel like I'm ...fading. Fading into nothing, and a watered down version of who I used to be. I want to come back and exist in color again.  I have to this time. Tomorrow is Day 1, again.

Its always when I have school work to complete.  I just can't seem to muster up energy or focus to write papers for grad school.  I procrastinate until last minute and rely on kratom shots to fuel me through writing an entire day...nonstop.  always get really good grades too...never got under an A in the past year of grad school, and used kratom probably over half of those papers.  

Im just so sick of this cycle.  I have a recovery group (who is aware of this)  a girl friend (who knows nothing about this), and just feel like I am losing my shit.  I also know this feeling will pass in a few days, but I need to freakin stay off this shit.  It never gets to a horrible place.  I keep up with my responsibilities through the ups and downs, but I am miserable or high and isolated...no in-between.

I quit for about 2 months back around April/May, but since then, I have been using on and off. I say on and off because I never got back to daily use like I had previously...more like doing an extract shot a day for a few days, then going no kratom for a few days so my tolerance doesn't build too much. In some ways, I think what I have been doing is even worse than using everyday. On the days that I use I feel good for a short period, then painful regret after for succumbing again, and on days I don't use, all I can think of is using again. It's messed up. 

I'm officially marking this down as the start of day 2. I don't feel terrible yet, just not great, and like my brain is fried from the constant see-saw I'm putting myself through. One thing I did differently this time is I woke up early, took a cold shower, followed by a Wim Hoff breathing session. This will generally put me in an almost normal state for a few hours while withdrawing. I also forced myself to go to the gym during my lunch break, which I haven't done since my last real quit. I also booked a doctors appointment to get checked out, and am looking into finding a therapist that maybe I can get  help working through some of what keeps me coming back to kratom. 

Considering my sporadic use, and what I have experienced previously, I'm probably looking at a few days of somewhat manageable acutes quickly followed by anhedonia. It's time to be done with this crap for good, which is why I am posting this. Today I made a pretty simple list based on some thinking I did last night titled ""Seek that which brings life, not death"". One one column is life, the other is death. I'm sure you all can figure out which column I placed Kratom. In the life column are thinks like working out, cardio, proper nutrition, taking my vitamins, spirituality, regular doctors appointments, that sort of thing. My goal is to make my best attempt to do the things in the life column daily and avoid the death column.

For a long, long time, I was very disciplined: only used a couple times a week, max, to keep my tolerance high and keep from getting dependent. 

This past August (right around the time I happily stumbled upon an excellent vendor with a high quality product) I said “screw it” and went daily. I kept my dosing relatively low even at my highest points of use (probably around 15 GPD), although I noticed my use was definitely slowly increasing over time. Within a month or two of daily K, I noticed it really wasn’t working as well and started noticing pronounced irritability, depression, emotional numbness, and motivation issues. A dose of Kratom might alleviate these feelings for all of 15 or 30 minutes of happiness, to be followed by a sustained cloudy feeling of being far away and numb.

Rather than continuing to notch up my dose to chase that old feeling, I read a hundred posts and a thousand comments on this sub, got freaked and started to taper, going from 10 GPD to 2.1 within a two-week time frame. I did experience mild withdrawals during the taper: increased fatigue, severe lack of motivation, depression, some middle of the night insomnia. Sometimes it was worse than mild and felt pretty uncomfortable. I had to keep reminding myself the sky wasn’t really falling. It was overall manageable, though. I did not take time off from work, for example.

My last dose was Friday night (2.1g). This weekend was relatively easy, though I had very low energy. As of this morning (Monday), some 60 hours after my last dose, I don’t have any noticeable withdrawals, although for the last three nights I’ve had to get up in the middle of the night and use decent amounts of cannabis to fall back asleep.

I did probably go overboard on supplements: BSO, NAC, buffered vitamin C, l-theanine for anxiety, traditional kava at night to help with falling sleep. And tons, tons of cannabis. Not sure if any of these ultimately helped or not, but worth sharing anyway.

I’m writing this post for lurkers who are where I was, earlier this year. If you’re young in your time with Kratom, incrementally increasing your dosage to get the same effect, stop now — it’s just not worth it. *If you’re past the initial honeymoon phase, Kratom is done for you. It will never be truly fun again.* Rather than increase, start decreasing your dosage. If you’re only a few months in with daily use, quitting is not so bad at all, nothing like the other posts on here. You don’t have to hit rock bottom to get to the end of your own use. I know I’m not out of the woods, yet, but I do know whatever is in store for me I can handle it.

I want this behind me. Now that I know the acutes are manageable I threw out my entire supply: it’s at the street currently, waiting for trash pickup. Low-use lurkers: join me!",90,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5153725}"

2021-11-22 06:40:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/qzjkcm/my_tapering_process/,My Tapering Process,"Hi everyone,

I posted on this sub for the first time about 22 days ago. For those 3 weeks I have been tapering.

After a few years with ""moderate"" Kratom usage I arrived at daily dosing (50-60 GPD). Mostly I dosed 3 times a day for maybe 3 or 4 months. Before that I dosed any other day but roughly the same ammount. Since I want to be free of my addiction I started tapering for the second time now and I have to say I am very pleased that it was very painless for me.

I switched from leave powder to 100% Stem&Vein and only had very light withdrawal at the most. The most notable thing I experience is a loss of motivation and mild anxiety.

**Start of my taper:** I started my taper with 2 doses a day. First dose was 15 grams of S&V and second dose was 10 grams of S&V. I stuck to this regime for 10 days. 

**10 days:** After the adjustment period I dropped to 2 doses of 15 grams and 5 grams for five days, with very slight withdrawals consisting of some shivers and sneezing as wall as light anxiety and a notable lack of motivation.

**15 days :** I stopped taking 2 doses and now only took 15 grams a day. The wd-symptoms are the same. Nothing noteworthy

**18 days:** I slowly decrease my dose to 10 grams a day. No bodily discomfort whatsoever, but the lack of motivation is really annoying me. I cant motivate myself to do sports and working can be very annoying too.

**22 days:** I pushed myself to go one day without the S&V and was very much suprised that this was really not a problem at all. I was 40 hours or so without it and did not feel worse. No shovering, or sneezing, no cold hot flushes or sweating. I am soooo happy about it! :) I will now take it only every two days, while slowly decreasing my dosage. Next stop 8 grams!

**Slip ups:** Here and there I had some slip ups and took about double the dose. Shit happens! But the great thing about S&V is for me that I do not get any rush from it, but only a very very slight effect. This is great for me since the motivation of gulping down this repugnant sludge very much decreased everytime I slipped up, since it did not do much for me.

Yesterday I ordered my last Pack of S&V and I will continue my tapering. It was very easy for me not to add my favourite strains to the shopping cart, which makes me a little proud of myself. With a little luck and dedication I will quit this shit for good at the end of the year. Wish me luck :)

I would advise anybody who is trying to quit to try supplementing their kratom dose with S&V. You can shift very slowly from leave powder to Stem and Vein. It was not painfull at all for me. It totally stopped withdrawal without making me high.

I preemptively cleared my Nov-Jan client load (yay for being a business owner) and at the end of October I started coming down. A couple months ago I tried and it didn’t work for me because I needed to be on point for work ect. I was doing about 5.5g every 3 or so hours 6-8 times a day. I read somewhere in here that 10% taper a week is preferable.

Well at the beginning of November I was already down to around 25 gpd, dosing 4.5g every 3-4 hours and only about 4 or 5 times a day!! For some reason my body was resistant and I would feel WD coming on around hour 3!! So I was going through mini WDs off and on all day and just pushing it by 15 mins, then 30, then an hour.

This past week (Tue & Weds) I took a certain prophylactic medication due to possible COVID exposure. Since my detox pathways were not flowing adequately, I think that medication really hammered my digestive system. I had gastritis, indigestion and constipation BAD and everything was not clearing out. So my doses were not being absorbed 😂 I felt everything just sitting in my gut. So I was basically forced to taper more lol. I felt like SHIT and even did an enema yesterday. That was rough.

As of the past two days, I’ve only dosed 4.2g every 5 hours and only 4 times a day!!! So I’m just under 18g now. I know it might not seem like a lot, but this is HUGE for me!

I’m thankful for the sickness for nudging me. It truly helped. Just had my last dose at 7, so I need to take my ass to bed. I know my body will wake me up at 4am. I can try to push it but maybe I will stay here and stabilize before coming down again. Or should I keep coming down? The past week has been rough and my whole body hurts. I’m afraid to eat certain foods and I feel like I’ve just run a marathon. 

I am chronically ill (I have several diseases) and while K would help with my pain, I think it’s actually causing me more harm. Kidney pain, anxiety, moodiness, insomnia, brain fog, loss of joy etc.

Any tips?? I take tablets so it’s way to easy to dose. Each tablet is .3 but each time I get a new batch, it’s weaker so we’ll see what happens with this new shipment, maybe I can drop to 3g every 5 hours. Or would it be better to stretch the time and keep the same dose for a while? I want to keep the momentum but I’m afraid. Once I’m down to about 5-10gpd maybe I can take the leap and go CT.

I quit kratom to go on a month or so long opioid binge. I ended up in rehab at age 18 after that whole thing, I hated it there, and quite honestly made me resent things like AA and the whole 12 step program...

I've been on it consistently since about September 2020, 30g at my heaviest usage and as of late... about 11g per day. I've wanted to quit for so long, my motivation, my mental health, my physical health all on the decline since late 2020. I tried to taper, but went back to the comfort zone every time I felt the slightest bit of emotion/anxiety. I did quit for a few other drug binges within the past 14 months, though I don't think that counts :'). I was planning to quit kratom after a heroin binge in April, though one of my closest friends passed away during that... and I lost a lot of hope. I started using flualpraz and kratom extract shots constantly. I've tapered on the flualp, but I will battle that after I'm clean from kratom, cause kratom is the larger issue for me at the moment. The cravings rn are overpowering, to put it lightly. I'm wondering if it would be a good idea at all to go buy a small extract shot tonight(36 hours), one of the Blues to be specific as they are split into multiple doses.  Take half so I can get a good sleep and then honestly idk what I'd do with the other half. After that I will be out of money for the rest of the week so I don't think wanting to buy more would be an issue. My stomach feels like it's in a knot... I don't think I'd be able to down capsules or powder atm. Should I try to stay strong or is there anything else I can do to have temporary relief? I had sleep paralysis and some minor hallucinations last night. Sorry for a whole ass biography btw lmao.",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5809324}"

I initially stopped cold turkey, but then started tapering down because it was unbearable.  I’m only on 2 grams a day right now, down from 12-14ish.

My issue is, I have become EXTREMELY irritable at work but I genuinely can’t tell if it’s kratom withdrawal, or if the kratom was masking how stressed and unhappy I was at my job, and now that I’m not on kratom I’m reacting normally.

My work situation is, I work at a failing retail business that has gotten more and more dysfunctional and hectic after the pandemic and going into holiday season.  A little under a year ago, I was promoted to a position at the location where I wouldn’t have to face customers or do any sales stuff, I just did computer work/data entry at a desk.  I was pretty happy at first.  Then, our labor budget got cut, they started making HUGE changes to save money, and over time they started having me do the jobs of THREE people for less pay than the person who had my job previously.

On top of being basically an account manager, I’m expected to sell items to customers, spending hours selling high end products and giving the sales associates credit so they make commission (part time sales associates make more money than me), I’m expected to handle customer service problems that isn’t even have anything to do with my job.  People with my title at other stores DO NOT have to do all of this, I’ve talked to other people with my job title and they are shocked the stuff I’m expected to do.  I’m stretched so thin, I legitimately only spend 20 percent of my day doing my ACTUAL job, and 80 percent doing other people’s jobs.  As a result, my actual job is falling apart as I’m making tons of mistakes with accounts.  My boss and the upper management is completely aware and I don’t get into any “trouble” because they’re exploiting me to do the job of 3 people, but it’s complete chaos.  A year ago, someone got paid more than me just to focus on balancing accounts, yet I’m supposed to do that job on top of sales manage and sell products to customers.

For the past few weeks, I’ve called out of work numerous times, showed up late, left early, threatened to quit, began rallying to have my coworkers unionize, tell my boss straight up that I’m going to submit my two weeks any day now, I will legitimately walk away from customers, just stopped caring about my job.  

I legitimately can’t tell if the kratom withdrawal is making me unable to handle stress and causing me to risk my only income, or if I was using kratom to deal with the stress and now that I’m without it, that I’m reacting “normally” and should focus on completely quitting kratom and find a better job?",8,"{'mask': 1, 'pandemic': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.68277454}"

Basically make it 2-3 days and then take 2 grams. Basically a really rapid taper. I went through hell that first time even while on Kratom because I reduced my dose so much that I avoided actually quitting for real because it terrified me.

Sauna-when it’s hard to do anything, this is the easiest. Just sweat it out. You will feel refreshed, endorphins will pump.

Exercise-make it a habit to do something and build up from there. In the beginning it’s hard to even make yourself go. You will feel better immediately after. Set goals and hold yourself to it.

If you are able to taper- be honest with someone. A lot of us are ashamed and hide the problem. Open up to your significant other or friend. I have my significant other keep the stash and they gave  me my morning dose and afternoon dose. It held me accountable.

Probiotic- this stuff wrecks your GI. There are yogurts, pills, drinks. It’s very beneficial to healing.

Black seed oil- it definitely helps. It almost feels similar to taking a dose when you’re in withdrawals.

DLPA- I take this in the morning on an empty stomach with vitamin C. It helps a bit with brain fog. If I take it late in the day or too much it can cause a bit of anxiety.

Apple cider vinegar- I would take this when I was tapering, supposed to help get more out of taking less.

Beet root powder- I think I’m sensitive to vasoconstriction. When I’m in withdrawals I get really cold hands and feet. This really works for the cold feeling.

Magnesium glycinate- helps at night for relaxation and soreness.

Sam-e- I took it for my first quit and think it helped with depression

Melatonin- helps with sleep but it can definitely make the morning a bit sluggish

A few tips- understand that depression/anxiety/irritability is being brought on by Kratom and these symptoms can linger and come in waves. It’s very easy to become negatively affected by these feelings. Cope with them in positive ways and realize that it will pass and you aren’t broken. There’s a few other things that I’ve tried but these are probably the most helpful.

I'm getting back to a dose that's getting close to being time to jump rather than keep stretching things out. I've been trying to remind myself of reasons why it will be better to quit and how even keeping a small habit is going to be worse than being totally sober.

My biggest struggle is how benign the addiction seems at times, I always think ""well it's better to relapse on kratom than opiates"", while I am glad that everytime I've relapsed I didn't go back to opiates, I also wish I could get it through my head that being on kratom isn't much better fore. I've been through several attempts to quit in the past 18 months, twice when I made it completely off and through the withdrawals. First time I relapsed bc I wasn't committed to quitting and thought I'd be fine if I just ""took a break"", second time from struggling with PAWS. 

Right now my three biggest motivators to quit are

1. Medication, I finally got on medication to treat the underlying issue that drove me to kratom. I want to get it right, I know having kratom in the mix will interfere with that and everytime my kratom use increased, it made medication less effective. Decreasing kratom use has done the opposite and made it more effective.

2. Dependence, I've been using for to long to get away with casual use. Having a physical dependence (even to a small dose) is a huge burden, I know everytime I use I'm just forcing myself to have to go through WD again at a later time.

3. Mood, kratom really messes with my mood, once I get a tolerance for it, it no longer calms me and I become very irritable. It can ruin my day so easily how such small things can upset me on kratom.

Anyway, I'd love to hear your reasons for quitting, I really need all the motivation I can get to make the inevitable jump.

Hopelessness, body aches and depression that took on a newly dark and grieving tone. Even when I was redoing alot these symptoms would creep up quickly. 
This relapse left me seriously afraid to quit again, and I couldn't afford this.

My friend who came off of h still had some Suboxone stowed away. I got one from him. 

Despite the label saying ""do not cut or swallow"" for some reason. I did just that, cutting a little strip, maybe 1.5mm x 2mm? Swallowing it down with some water. In about 30 minutes the depression indeed lifted. I slept just fine and experienced minimal emotional symptoms, not much physical either. But physical is much more bearable to me than emotional. 

6 days later I kept up the same dose daily, I haven't even used an 8th of a sublingual dose. And the grieving depression has lifted. Time to titrate and lower my dose. 

Suboxone allowed my body to forget about the constant urge to redose, and is much more predictable and gradual with the elimination. And took next to nothing to ease the worst of the symptoms. Anybody else have any experience w this? Cheers",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4463668}"

I’m a senior in high school who’s struggled with anxiety and manic depression most of my life. I’ve been on many meds and though they have worked I somehow found myself medicating with Kratom.

I heard of some of my friends using this drug recreationally and began to look into it. Once I heard that it helped with anxiety, depression, etc. I gave it a shot. I headed down to my local head shop where we buy cheap cigarillos to roll up with, and picked up a pack of red maeng da. I began to self mediate with it for anxiety on an as needed basis. I fell in love with it for the first couple weeks but quickly found that the drug that I though was curing my anxiety, was the new main cause of it. I felt trapped and scared. i found myself taking Kratom to stay away from the withdrawals that spiked my anxiety.

After 5 months of every day use, dosing multiple times a day, I knew I had to stop. I knew that tapering would never work for me. I had to go CT like I did with with nicotine and caffeine. I threw out my kratom thursday. I feel like complete shit. The hardest part is going to school and then to work at the restaurant waiting tables while withdrawing. I stay busy from 8 am to 11:30 pm with work and school. This is hell and the worst part is that I’m withdrawing in front of my friends and family who have no idea why I’m sweating all day, depressed, sick as a dog with no motivation and intense body pains.

This horrendous withdrawal has left me feeling utterly hopeless and makes me realize that i will never touch that shit again. It is NOT worth it. Kratom is a LIE.

I started this taper switching to a lower potency kratom, from 1.5% MIT to 1.0%. About 4 weeks ago. Despite staying at the same dosage of 40gpd this step was very difficult, let my immune system down and I was very sick for the first time since My daughter was born 5 years ago.  I gltooj 3 covid tests because I thought I had it.  It was bad, plus classic wd, but i needed that reminder of what I’ve been doing to myself.  

Once I stabilized at 40gpd/40mg mitra, I divided my typical 10g4x/day dose up to 6 smaller doses of 6 grams = 36 @ day 1.  Aiming to take 1g off daily, currently at 20g/day and have been forgetting to take my doses.  I’m ahead of schedule. 

Yeah, that’s right.  I’ve been forgetting to take kratom.  I think the mushrooms have a lot to do with that.  

I’ve taken 100mg psilocybin mushroom, 100mg lions mane, and b-complex with my first dose for the last week.  My mood is kinda good and I’m

My first question is, is it possible I'm still withdrawaling from the first strain? Cause I'm feeling awful on my 3rd day without it.

As a matter of fact, I decided to quit because I have battled addiction with it before & I know I'm at the point where I'm gonna go in deep if I don't stop now.

The reason why I even picked it up again was because I have been withdrawaling from antidepressants (long story, but switching doctors & don't have anyone to give me anymore, but it's been too long now) & I started using it again when family crises came up.

I'm scared because I've never felt as empty as I did right before taking it again, I live alone & can't tell my family I got addicted again. 

Another threshold I'm at, and why I'm going cold turkey tomorrow is I've spent all the money I've alloted & going any further would start to cause financial stress, and that's the last thing I need.

With the assistance of exercise and meditation, I have been peeling back that which leaves me with hinderences and replacing them with fortifying practices. 

It is not all uphill, and I'm not just magnetically drawn to continue to improve. I wake up not feeling like it often but push through it. Sometimes I let myself lapse into laziness, but I fight to get back up and keep walking. 

No matter how far along you are on the road, you're always right next to a ditch!

I'm not a stranger to this sub. I've attempted to post threads here numerous times trying to quit but I always ended up failing myself and got back on the shit.

From the last 5-6 months, I try to quit at the end of every kilo, telling myself that i'll taper off and quit. But 1-2 days into the taper i get sucked back into buying another kilo. And every time I buy a kilo, the quality gets worse and worse.  The latest kilo i bought on 11/15 had zero kratom in it at all. I have reason to believe it's actually akuamma because it turns a total dark brown instead of the green it normally should be. Another reason i think it's akuamma is because it actually keeps my withdrawals at bay every time i dose. 

I ended up buying small batches of three other kratoms in crazy desperation for the next buzz but every single one of them are absolutely bunk. Haven't been able to catch a buzz at all. It's like the universe is forcing me to finally throw in the towel. Weirdly enough -- I'm actually very grateful because this has been a long time coming.

My last buzz was on 11/14. Despite the akuamma keeping the majority of the WD at bay, yesterday (day 3) was probably the worst I've felt all week. I wish I knew how much the mu opioid receptors (speciosa) and the other opioid receptors (hirsuta & akuamma) crossover because i want to know how close i am to being able to jump. i have no frame of reference since akuamma is a completely new substance to my body.  


Regardless, I am not sure if it's practical to actually say this, but in my mind i feel like i've been off kratom for 4 days now. I say this because i haven't gotten high at all. And all this bunk kratom is doing is providing my brain the negative reinforcement that it needs to overwrite the habit/addiction.

I'll keep dropping my dose of this nonsense stuff over the course of the next few days and continue to test how many hours I can go before I start to feel WD conditions I can't perform at work at.

At this point I'm convinced that all the kratom in my city (houston tx) is absolutely BS and that I'll never be able to successfully use again. Which is exactly the mindset that I need to continue reinforcing so that I can finally let this damn addiction go for once and for all.

I've been fighting with myself to make a thread in this sub for the last 4 days but finally worked up the strength to do it. I've been studying the threads in this sub for strength, and I am really grateful for the people on here who share their experience.

This will be a sight ramble with no editing:

The point of this post is - I remember how hard it was the first week. Physical withdrawals like I could never imagine. No sleep for days. But, to be honest after those left it was almost embarrassingly easy to never be tempted by kratom again. I know it’s different for everyone so I’m just saying what happened to me - I have no desire to do kratom again since surviving the withdrawals. You can do it and once you pass that first month you will have a fresh perspective on your struggle and probably have an easy time leaving it alone. The first few weeks are the hardest! Taper for the first few days but guess what you will go through hell no matter what. Good luck to you all, it’s worth quitting and easier to stay clean after the first week or two of hell 👍",25,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4877623}"

It has been at least a couple months since I last posted on here, but felt the strong need to. I just need to get a few things off my mind/chest that have really been bothering me lately. And don't get me wrong, my wife is the all-around loveliest person I know of and I tell her everything/anything these days, but sometimes I feel like she just does not quite fully understand some of the things I struggle with (mostly mentally) because she has been fortunate enough to have never gone through the hell of being an addict. She has her own struggles as we all do, but this one in particular, and all that comes with it, is alien to her.  God bless her, she will always listen and give a great response, but I also like hearing from many other different viewpoints as well.

Back in August, I tapered down quite a bit from about 50-60 GDP to around 10 GPD in a few weeks time, and then just jumped off completely 4 days before my daughter was born in late August. And, I actually was COMPLETELY off of this crap for 2 whole weeks. I felt very good about the direction of things, despite the lack of energy, sadness, and all the rest that comes with it. Then a really bad day at work was the catalyst that lead to me saying ""screw it"", and I stopped and grabbed some slime at the gas station while I was out working delivering my route. I told myself it would not continue on, but just be a one time thing...and here we are, 3 months later and tapering down to nothing again from about 15 GPD currently. 

I just wanted to post to vent a little (sorry again) and say that I just feel like a complete failure and hopeless case. I want to just leave it behind so bad, but feel like life is so demanding of me in all areas that it would be nearly impossible. Not only that, the thing that gets me even worse that the physical side of it, is surely the mental. I have always had very low self esteem, and being a functioning drug addict/father/husband for 7+ years has not helped with that one bit. I am constantly, CONSTANTLY beating myself up mentally over it all. Rolling past mistakes and regrets around in my mind, relentlessly hurling insults and criticisms at myself, and incessantly reminding myself that I am a loser and a lost cause. 

I am sadly at a point where I feel like the damage is done. I know it is not deep down, but I just can't seem to give myself a break and feel like such a piece of shit. The past will just not seem to leave me be. It haunts me all day, every day. Like, ""Why did things have to be that way for so many years?"" It just really sucks. I know we are also supposed to just give our cares over to God and trust in his words, but I am not even sure if I have gone too far in my awfulness even for him. I always feel like I have committed far too many terrible and unpardonable acts/sins at this point. I know that is most likely untrue as well, but I just can't shake the feeling. I'll leave it be right there...this board has always had so many wonderful and intelligent folks, I honestly would not know really know who else to talk/vent to if it were not for the Quitting K reddit sub. Many thanks, much love, and prayer to you all...if I ever make it to the other side of the fence, I vow to commit my life to helping others who are struggling with issues of addiction and self worth. Have a lovely day folks...

Reality is beginning to feel fake to me, where I disassociate from everything completely. It really feels like a simulation, I feel like a stranger in my own mind.

Can such a low kratom dosage tank levels that low? 

I have all the symptoms of low T. I really don’t want to start TRT for the rest of my life. My wife and I just had a baby 8 months ago and we want to have another one soon, as we are getting up there in age.

A lot of ppl here pointed out that the numbers printed on the bag usually are not at all accurate and the actual alkaloid content could be way different. Anyway when I switched strains I initially increased the dose by 20% to compensate for the lower potency, but even after the adjustment it was taking more kratom to keep the withdrawals away and I had been at a pretty low dose on my taper (5gpd), but with the new strain it was taking around 10gpd (sometimes more). Today, I stopped at a smoke shop to pickup another strain (different brand too) to see how much it would take to keep the withdrawals at bay. So far I've been feeling fine taking smaller doses, I think the one batch I got that wasn't working was probably a bad batch with either extremely low potency or possibly cut down with filler (I've had some kratom in the past that had so much filler I could actually off color particles in the powder). Anyway, I'm glad to know my tolerance wasn't the issue and it was just bad K, before I switched strains I was thinking heavily of jumping since 5gpd was extremely low, I'm still considering it, but I've been struggling to mentally prepare, but I'm hoping switching to a new batch I'll be able to get back on track with my taper, even if I'm not quite ready to jump, having a lower daily dose gives me more confidence that I'm a step closer to finishing the taper.

    I was at one point at 11-18gpd. I'm now slowly (with some bumps in the road) on around 6.5-10 gpd. It's very tedious and if I get close to 10-11g in a day I feel ashamed and more depressed. I have tons of school I need to catch up on, and my focus sucks on anything.( I most likely have an attention deficit disorder with anxiety/depression but i don't self diagnose cause it's biased). 
    I would love to taper a day or two more and then go through whatever withdrawal I need to go through and start getting back to just weed for the time being. I have particularly bad constipation even though I've been eating a lot of fiber. But it's probably because I took too much to get sleep last night (another dumb setback) 
   Another issue is I'm tapering two substances at the moment or trying my hardest and as much as I want to be physically and mentally better I don't know how to do this alone. Many of my friends and all of my family doesn't know about my usage. I need to do this for myself in all aspects but I just have no vested interests in life and don't feel like I'm accomplishing anything being behind in school and struggling to find work. 
   I do not have any solid friends here at school. (Most of them have dropped out/graduated if they were a real one). With little availability from my family due to them being in the dark/not having time for me I'm just so lost and wish I could just keep some sort of will power for more than a day. I know this process isn't easy but I just don't trust myself to stick with it at all. At the end of the day I hate the substances but they do still half the time relieve boredom, horrible depression and anxiousness about everything. 
  This was kinda just written off the dome and have never really voiced a piece of my life like this to random ppl. I just don't know where to turn anymore and don't want to let myself give in to breaking the taper every other day or so. I want to choose life but the steps I keep falling over cause I got impulsivity up the ass. Advice?",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8871521}"

I use a small piece of wax paper and tare it to 0. Then I measure using 2 tsp and a little extra. 
I notice if I move the powder around on the scale like where the pile of powder sits, it  fluctuates like crazy. I dont know if it's too much powder one small travel scale surface or what is the problem.

I’ve finally made the decision that it’s time to get off of Kratom for good. I’ve felt enslaved to the green beast for a few years now but never wanted to face the WDs that were in my future. I’ve used daily for about 6 years now. At the highest I was using 9-12 gpd split into 3-4 doses throughout the day. From what I’ve read thats a relatively mild dose. 

In August I contracted COVID and though I was never admitted to the hospital struggled with it to the extent in made me reevaluate my health and the substances I was putting into my body. I recently tapered off a mild phenibut dependency with success. A little trial and error and it was pretty painless. This has given me the confidence to taper off Kratom. 

I dropped back to two 2.4 gram doses a day about 2.5 months ago where I’ve been holding steady since. Last week I decided I would shave off .25 grams every 5th day until I reach 0. I recently lost my job and have been dealing with some RUQ discomfort that has been alarming. I’ve decided to hold off looking for work until the 1st of the year in order to get my health in order and try to get as low as possible with a taper. I believe I can get down to 2 gpd at the rate I’m going by the 1st. 

I’m currently down to 4.25 gpd. I know this is a slow taper but my wife is dealing with the loss of her mother so I need to be there for her. I don’t want to add any additional stress to her if possible. I expect minor WDs but I believe by going slow I can mitigate those and hopefully mitigate PAWS which makes me most nervous. 

I haven’t felt that lovely Kratom feeling in a week now and while I do miss it, I still feel good and want to be out doing things. I’m grateful I never got carried away with my usage but do expect some sort of WD as I used daily for a long time. Reading other’s experiences on this forum has inspired me. I’m excited to be free from this in the next few months and not have to worry about meal timing and how I’m going to travel with it.

Was only about two months ago that I had everything set up perfect to finally quit for good. I quit CT and made it to day 9. I felt great.....unfortunately too great. I was able to trick myself into believing I could seriously take just one this one day since I was SO over it. Then I said man just one more this next day and obviously everybody here knows how that went.

So I started the new Big Quit by taking my last shot Sunday evening. It’s been almost 2 days and tougher than I remember.

What I do remember is how much this community helped me, so that’s why I’m back. I hate myself for starting back up (of course) but I also feel like maybe that was the plan all along. All night the last two nights I hardly slept at all & all I could think was how fucking stupid I was to put myself thru this all again.

But I can only hope that when day 9 rolls around again I’ll have enough fortitude not to put myself thru it a 3rd time. So I’m hoping my relapse is just what I needed to really quit for good.

I used 30-40 gpd for 10 years straight, tapered for 6 weeks and jumped on 8/18. I used gabapentin for the first 10 days after jumping.

Things haven't been easy these past three months. My acutes were mild, thanks to the taper and the gabapentin. After the acutes and after the gabapentin I rolled straight into some PAWS stuff. Thankfully the depression part of PAWS missed me. The anxiety was my thing. 24 hours after stopping the gabapentin I was waking up every hour with a very high heart rate and a brain stewing in anxiety.

The very acute anxiety lasted for nearly two weeks before it started to rapidly decrease. This was very welcome, however, sleep did not improve for a few more weeks. IIRC I was just under 60 days when I slept uninterrupted. Thankfully sleep has been good since then. I still struggle when first falling asleep, but once I'm down I sleep like a baby.

I had really bad RLS during my taper, and mild but -enduring- RLS since the jump. I -still- have some lingering RLS issue. They appear right around the time I'm going to bed and these days is just felt in my ankle area. I try to exhaust my leg muscles everyday with some exercise, which helps, but the shadow the the RLS is still there, sadly.

I also still feel some slight prickly sensation all over my body when I first wake up and in random occurrences through the day. This is the final form of the ""burning skin"" sensation that a lot of us get during the acutes. It's totally manageable right now, and has been for most of these 90 days, but it is still there.

Oh, and I also still get into some marathon yawning sessions.

So things are going well, but I'm definitely not back to normal yet.

Throughout all of this I have never once regretted making the jump. Despite the anxiety, the icky nerves, the sweating, the RLS, it has been 100% worth it. 

If you're a long time user scared about jumping, please know that even if it isn't easy it is still so much better than one more day chained to Kratom. I just don't have to worry about that shit -at all- anymore and it is priceless.

If you're not a longtime user but my 90 days of RLS is freaking you out, don't worry. I'm pretty sure the RLS has continued this long because I used for a decade. That's a lot of chemistry to undo, and my body is still working it out.

I could use some encouragement. Not only does repeating this process is absolutely wracking my brain, I just can't get through the PAWS and anhedonia, a few months later. I start feeling better, pretty much normal, and all of a sudden I cannot control the urge and slip as much as 5 months into recovery. I hope I can get through this again. Definitely gets harder or at least more annoying each time. I've tried many things from hypnotherapy to exercise to improved diet, you name it.

I used Kratom as a crutch for every possible scenario in my life. I tried dozens of times to quit but this time it’s actually sticking. I’ve never made it past a day before. Now I’m 6 going on 7 days without consuming Kratom. I’m gonna tell you how I’ve managed so far: 

1. You gotta, gotta be nice to yourself. What this means for me was watching movies, going on walks, eating healthy or playing video games. Something to distract you from the fact that this shit is leaving your system. The first 4 days I was pretty much posted up in bed but allowed myself to do that. I was uncomfortable as hell but I just tried to dive into a good movie, write or just listen to music. 

2. Supplements. I used CBD with Turmeric, ashwaghanda, L- Theanine, and KAVA. Definitely helps keep the edge off. Also use Advil if you need to keep the pain and chills
Away if needed

3. This is gonna sound hokey but make Kratom your bitch. Yell at it, scream at it, curse at it. Make it known that it’s time to stop. Throw that shit away. Spit on the bag and be motherfuckin proud of yourself that your aren’t going to let this control your life anymore. 

4. If tempted to relapse. Think of the why you want to stop in the first place. Know that it gets  better. It does. The first few days were like me trying to learn to walk again. I wanted it, I even drove to get some but I had to remember why I was stopping. 

I just wanted to post this because this is an awesome group and I believe in every single one of y’all. Kratom was a life changer in the beginning but turned malevolent in the end. I never in a million years thought I could go a single day without it. I’ve gone 6 now. I’m still alive. I’m not always comfortable but that’s ok.

Just looking for help,"I've been reading posts on this thread for awhile now. I've used kratom on and off for the past 2 years. Originally I was only on small doses. 3-6 GPD for a few months and gradually worked up to 8-10 GPD over the course of the year. Where I lived at the time kratom was not easily accessible. I had to drive 30min one way to a head shop that had some bad quality stuff. I had to order it online and wait a week to get it so that made it easier to quit. I went on a 3 day backpacking trip without any and after that I was done. I also had lots of friends where I lived at the time, we were all very active and so my mind was easily distracted. Anyway, that quit was fairly easy but only lasted a few months until I said ""I'll just get one bag and do it on occasions"". Bullshit.

I started using again at the same doses, daily. I was doing great at work and it didn't seem to affect anything, but it made my nights alone enjoyable. Snap forward to the present..

I wanted a change and landed in good job in a new state, so I moved to Colorado and kratom is everywhere. My intake jumped to 15-25 GPD and it's been about 9 months. I really want to quit and last night decided to kick it after I finished my bag. I made it over 24 hours with minor withdrawals until it got dark and boredom set in. Usually I would go on a bike ride or something but here's the thing.. I broke my arm a couple weeks ago and can't ride my bike which is my passion. So I went out and bought a couple ounces tonight. I'm upset with myself for doing that after making it past the 24 hour mark. I justified it in my head due to my broken arm and being bored and lonely. Another huge obstacle for me is that I can't smoke MJ at the moment due to getting my CDL license, after a decade of daily use. I told myself it will be easier to quit when I can actually ride my bike and be with my girlfriend.

My girlfriend and I have been long distance for about a year but would make time to see eachother like every other month. She doesn't know about my addiction currently, but I did inform her of my previous addiction after I kicked it. I'm moving to the Las Vegas area to be with her in a few weeks and I really really want to quit before I move in with her.

So I guess what I'm getting at is.. has anyone tried to quit with an obstacle such as a broken bone and being lonely? Should I just go CT or taper? Should I wait until my mental state is better (can ride my bike and spend time with my girl)? What kind of coping mechanisms did you use?

I really appreciate you all and any comments will help.

This is my first post on this forum. I'm posting to give encouragement to anyone trying or wanting to quit.  I've gotten a lot of support and advice from reading success stories here and tips for quitting kratom. I used kratom for years as a way to stay away from worse things, but it became obvious that the amount and the frequency I was taking kratom was affecting my personal life. It came between my most important relationships, kept me from travelling because of worry about when and if I'd be able to have it when I traveled, and generally was a ball and chain around me when I considered doing anything. I took kratom for a few years and at my highest point I don't know how much I was taking and I didn't care. I took it multiple times a day whenever I felt like it. It felt like it was helping and it was legal so I thought it was alright, but I realized it had as much of a grip on me as anything did in the past has. I used the tapering method with support and accountability from my girlfriend and best friend and it was amazing how well it worked. It was difficult, but nowhere near impossible. With the tapering method there is no pressure of when to drop to the lower dose, but you cannot cheat. Whatever you set for your dose for the day (set it ahead of time), you stick to it. Before long I had built the confidence that i could get through work and the normal stress of life without it. It didn't take too much longer before I had built the confidence to drop my last dose and I've been kratom free for 18 days. It may not seem like a long time to some, but I didn't think I'd ever be off of it. I'm still not 100%, but I'm about 90-95 % and not having the stress of always thinking about if and when I'll be able to take a dose has been life changing. I see now that it was always possible, just scary to try to go on without it. I was closer to being able to quit than I realized. It takes a strict plan, support and accountability from loved ones, and honesty with yourself, but it can be done. I hope this helps someone out there. Wishing the best for anyone struggling with this. You can do it!",19,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5669671}"

I am on day 26 from about 5 months of daily use probably averaging around 15 GPD. This is my 2nd quit, having quit 2 years ago from around 20 GPD for somewhere around 16 months or so. My first quit was pretty easy. Once I made the jump, I was feeling pretty good after about a week or so. 

I am feeling a lot better than the first few weeks with a few exceptions. The major one being nasty fatigue. I wake up in the morning exhausted and can't seem to get motivated to do anything until the afternoon. I am in a fortunate situation as I am still working from home, but my productivity over the last 4 weeks has nosedived. 

What complicates things is that I had major surgery on my hip 2 weeks ago so I am still recovering from that and can't do excessive exercise or long walks yet (though I have been doing stretches, some upper body workouts and the exercise bike with little resistance). I was prescribed an opioid to deal with post surgery pain and I am sure that has slowed my recovery. It's been 8 days since I have used any drug, though I wasn't abusing the painkillers - only took as prescribed for pain control. 

So far in my quit 26 days out:

**The good:**

* Sleeping 6-8 hours a night
* Most physical symptoms have resolved
* No more GI issues 
* I get brief glimpses of ""normal""
* Appetite has returned 
* RLS is more manageable 
* Depression and anxiety are manageable 
* No cravings

**The bad:**

* Fatigue is killer
* Lack of motivation
* Sex drive still low, but seems to be returning
* Anhedonia is very real 
* Some very transient aches, sweats and sneezing

Right now, the big thing is the fatigue. I just want to sleep and not work, which is not normal for me. I know I have it better than a lot of folks, but I suppose I just needed to vent. I've also read other posts where these types of symptoms seem to be normal at this timeframe, but damn, this really caught me off guard based on how my last quit went. 

At any rate, just needed to vent. Hope you are doing well wherever you are at in your quit. Upwards and onwards.",10,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43379402}"

I sit the whole day in front of my computer, surfing on reddit and do nothing usefull, everything feels very boring. Will this feeling ever end?

Instead of just outright reducing my dose, I try to wait as long as I possibly can after waking up to take my first dose. Once I take that first dose I’ll take kratom as needed until going to bed. But waiting so long makes that first dose hit way harder so I’m still taking way less than normal after that first dose. 

Out of the dozens of times I’ve tried to quit, this seems like by far the best approach for me personally. Kratom makes me an extremely unproductive person, content with doing fucking nothing for myself. I’ve found that I am so much more productive during the day now, since I constantly seek out stuff to do to distract me from the WD’s and am not held back by kratom’s numbing effect. I’ve started lifting, going on long walks, playing guitar, and reading, none of which I would have ever done while on kratom.

For anyone struggling to cold turkey or taper in traditional ways, I cannot recommend this enough. It is so much easier to dramatically reduce your dose this way, and you can still actually sleep at night. I cut my dose by more than half by day 3 with little trouble, which I never even came close to in any other taper. Seriously try it.

I'm 25 years old and I just moved to a new city. Kratom is completely draining my resources. It was one thing when I lived at home with barely any bills to pay. But now I'm making only about $2300 a month with $1200 a month in bills and almost the entirety of my extra money has been going to kratom. 

I started taking it in high school about 8 years ago. Got pretty addicted to it for a couple years and managed to kick it on my own for about 2 years. Then about 3 years ago I started working at a factory where drugs were rampant, and one guy in particular was constantly taking kratom and adderall and giving me some. I wasn't strong enough to turn it down and it started all over again, 10x worse now that I was making a solid amount of money. I moved in with my friends and got evicted - by my own friend - *and* had my car repoed because I was so bad at managing my money. I had more than enough to live the life I wanted but threw it away for kratom. 

I got a new job, moved back home, and started saving money. I never stopped using but I thought I was doing better. I thought I was managing it. I moved up really quickly at my new job, thanks in no small part to the energy and focus I credited to kratom. I took a risk and moved to a big city to try and live the life I've always wanted. And instead I've spent most of my free time holed up in my apartment because I'm constantly broke and can't afford to do any of the things I came here to do. I've been so depressed. I feel like a failure. I feel like I've lost myself again. And I'm tired of feeling that way. I know if I get rid of this habit, things will be so much better. But I'm so scared. Scared of the anxiety and withdrawals that come with quitting. Scared of being forced to confront my choices. Scared of failing at work because I'm suffering and can't tell them why. Scared of disappointing my family and my parents again. Especially my dad who has been so proud of me for this move. 

But it's time. I can not quit CT because of my job. I know that sounds like an excuse but it's true. I've tried and the WDs make me incapable of working. But I know I can get through the days on small doses. So it starts today. I'm taking 8 grams with me to work and leaving the rest here. I will do that for a week or two, I think. Then it will go down to 6, then 4, then 2, then nothing. And I may feel uncomfortable but I'll survive. 

And, most importantly, I'm going to tell my dad. The thought terrifies me but I know he'll support me. He knew of my first round with kratom. But I'm going home this weekend and I can't do it in secret.

I know switching strains is not recommended for a taper, but I'm wondering what my best plan of action is to get back on track. My biggest concern is how much I may have messed up my tolerance by having 2 days I went over my taper limit. I know for me it takes about 5 days to really see how much my body has adjusted to a new dose, so I won't really know how bad I messed up my tolerance until later in the week. The other big concern I have is switching strains, I'm worried there may be a big enough difference between the strains that even if my tolerance isn't effed up, that the strain won't be enough to stay functional without upping dose significantly. I know I'm in the home stretch of the taper and even if I did mess up my tolerance it shouldn't take that long to get back to where I was, but I'm just so panicked rn about it and having gone through WD's twice (once CT once taper) in the past 18 months I'm really going hard on myself about it bc I do not want to relapse again. Also, anyone with experience with similar situations, should I switch back to the strain I started my taper with or stay with the new one once I'm used to it?",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5668417}"

Using around a shot and half a day for 7 months, decided to test a cold Turkey run this weekend with 5mg edible. 

1st day of edible no Kratom- knocked on my ass the entire day from edible. Stoned out of my mind. Didn’t even think about kratom. If someone offered, I woulda passed respectively. Nighttime- edible still on cruise control, slept with like a baby throughout the night. 10/10 day.

2nd day no kratom- same thing, 5mg in the morning, stoned off my ass until 5pm. Took a nice nap, no urge at all to use. Broke off another half of edible around bedtime and for some reason it ROCKED my shit. Woke up @12 high as a kite some paranoia but I squashed it and got another 7hr of sleep. 9/10 day.

This morning- work up fine, my nose was really runny, took a big poop. Didn’t take a edible and no urge to use again tbh. I feel refreshed, no withdrawal and the first time in a while, I’m not thinking about the sludge. If I start to feel some WDs my plan is just to take a small piece of the edible and ride it out again. 

Conclusion- very surprised on how effective a small amount of THC is basically destroying WD symptoms. Let’s see if I can utilize this method the entire week and keep up with minimizing WDs. Will update again",13,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43620652}"

Feeling better, sleep is key, gabapentin and compression socks are a huge help.","As the title says, it’s been 41 hours since my last dose 4pm on Friday. The first night was absolute torture. I hate it and wanted to dose every 5 minutes. But you have to push through. The second day was hard as well, luckily I had a lot to do for work that kept my mind off of it, but I was part zombie. I had some left over gabapentin from when I quit 2 years ago, I took 600mg last night around 10pm. It was a very interesting night. I woke up all the time but by 4am I think I slept till 8:30 and now I feel way way better. Still feel a little loopy from the gaba. If you’re struggling with sleep, go see a doctor get some help. You’re not alone in this fight, and for me gaba has been a life savor. I can’t imagine walking into this hour with no sleep since Thursday. 


But I’ve been having heart issue and high blood pressure, and I think Kratom was the culprit. I won’t know till I’m off of it but my BP hasn’t spiked since. So that was my biggest motivation the first night to quit, throw away all my Kratom, clean up that little corner of my room that’s full of Kratom powder from weighing it out. 

This time I’m done and never looking back. It’s not worth it. I want to be more productive with my life moving forward. We’re only given one life, now I i want to live it. 

P.S. get some compression socks, I wore those last night and barely felt any RLS, and I’ve battled Restless Leg my whole life, it’s one reason I enjoy Kratom so much, it got rid of ym RLS and allowed me to sleep. But give it enough time that Kratom turns on you.

Long story short I had 9 years in recovery from all mind altering substances.  Opiates were my drug of choice.  I’ve always known to stay away from kratom because I’ve heard the stories and any dummy can see how closely related it is with other opiates.  Last March I was in Mexico I was on an extended trip, it was my first time being a “digital nomad”.  I felt on top of the world.  It was also the beginning of a new relationship with the current love of my life.  What a blessing it’s been to have her in my life.  But at the time I was starting to have a lot of anxiety about what it meant for my “freedom” and being in a relationship.  My heart wanted monogamy but I was also scared.  I was eating at a restaurant in Tulum, MX and they had kratom on the menu.  I gave in to the temptation.  I loved the feeling.  Reassured myself I had to be careful with it, it felt like a slippery slope with my recovery.  I started using it more frequently.  I started to really like the combination of girlfriend and kratom hangouts.  Felt similar to my heroin days of getting high and cuddling with my ex.  Fast forward to now, I’ve been off and on.  Typically for a month I’ll be using every day at about 20 gpd, and then quit for a couple weeks.  It’s fucked with me so bad.  I kept telling myself I didn’t relapse and that I had 9 years still but I just can’t live with that dishonesty towards myself anymore.  Life feels so heavy right now.  I don’t work out anymore, I’m always dizzy, I’m super reclusive and I just generally feel so lost.  Which is all a sharp contrast from who I used to be.  I was the poster boy of sobriety, speaking at treatment centers, helping others etc.  I keep justifying to myself that I’m in a new chapter in life and ready to not be the outgoing person I once was and that the kratom doesn’t have a lot to do with it.  But that’s just not true.  It’s dimming my soul.  But I’m scared to quit.  And I can’t put my finger on why.  It’s not the withdraws, which won’t even be that bad, especially compared to heroin withdrawals.  I think what it is, is the classic attribute of addiction.  These substances become like baby blankets for us in such an overwhelming world.  They truly rewire our brains with continued use.  At my core I have the belief that I’m not going to be safe or ok without it?  My higher self knows that’s not true but it’s still a battle.  I plan to practice what I’ve preached to the hundreds of people I’ve helped over the years, ONE DAY AT A TIME.  There’s no more room for me to have a healthy relationship with substances.  Sobriety is the only path for a guy like me.  Thank you for reading.  Much love everyone! Keep up the good fight!

Day 1 tomorrow.,"I was tapering fairly successfully after my 5+ year long 60+ gpd habit for about a month and a half, got down to 4g a day and was feeling great, far better than when I was on a heavier dose. Then my relationship fell apart and I did what I always do when experiencing relationship stress, take more. Been doing about 7-10g for the past week, so not terrible, but I can just feel it that my mindset is not strong enough for controlled use right now, because of how sad I am. I still WANT to quit so bad, I was so happy at 4 g, I could taste the freedom, but the emotional pain and desire to numb makes it compulsive if I have it around. So I decided to toss the stash. Threw it away at a Fred Meyer so I can't go dig through my garbage in the morning when I want it. 

I really hope that a week at this higher dose didn't erase all of the progress I made, as I can't afford multiple weeks of debilitating brain fog and terrible sleep and restlessness and inability to focus with all that I've got going on right now, finishing my bachelor's and applying for graduate programs. Does anyone know from experience if it will have? 

I was also really surprised by how quickly increasing the dose made me need it more frequently to not get restless, or the cold sweats. Definitely motivating to cut it out again. I know those are withdrawal symptoms, so I'm feeling like this may be rough, but I'm cautiously optimistic that they won't last as long. I've had TERRIBLE withdrawals with previous CT quits.

I ran out the night before work, and on the way to work the other day I just told myself I would grab some after my shift. But a couple hours into my shift, *intense* withdrawals started kicking in. I couldn't believe it, just about 12 hours without a dose and I was withdrawling bad. 

I am physically addicted to this stuff. I am on day 1 of no kratom and going through all the withdrawal symptoms. 

Thinking back I have had a host of medical problems over the past year that may or may not have to do with kratom - including muscle convulsions: abdomen, legs, arms - like a seizure almost - and intestinal problems I have never had before. That's something anecdotal but mentioning it to see if it improves. 

I noticed today the withdrawal symptoms lessen when I get up and do something (which is not easy), and get worse when I sit still. Just food for thought.

So instead I decided to do a rapid 7 day suboxone taper to help kick the kratom withdrawls without feeling withdrawl and today is my first day no suboxone so day 8 of clean from kratom but now I’m feeling the PAWS and can’t tell if I’m going to have brutal suboxone withdrawls or not. I go back to work Tuesday and I can’t feel like garbage at the job I do. I help perform surgery, etc so I have to be extremely alert and I’m so so scared. will I be ok or am I going to experience sun withdrawls after only taking them 7 days. My taper from the subs looked like this. Day 1&2 8mg day 3&4 6 mg day 5&6 4 mg and day 7 2mg. Wondering if I should take one mg today or just jump from here. Please help. I never took subs before but was told it would help me come off kratom super fast. I’ve tried tapering kratom over a month and it never worked I didn’t have the discipline to taper kratom. That’s why my only option was to do CT But take suboxone for seven days to get through the majority of the bad kratom withdraws

I’m feeling the withdrawls. I fucked up. Whatever made me think a rapid taper of suboxone would get me thru kratom WD I was playing with fire. Now I feel I won’t be able to get off suboxone without using kratom to help. It never ends. I’ve got two 8mg strips left. Two days ago I jumped from 1mg after a week and my withdrawls were to much I took .5 mg to help ease it. Im planning to skip a few days again until I feel horrible and take .25 and then hoping to jump from there. Any advice helps to help me come off these subs without having to get more.

I CT'd the first time and experienced the worst possible acutes (the RLS was a beast unlike anything I've ever experienced. It was so severe I thought I was going to have to amputate my legs). 

That may be a bit overdramatic, but it was the worst I have ever felt, and I was a long time opioid user in the past and went through those withdrawals. In my experience, kratom withdrawals are way worse than opioid withdrawals, just my opinion.

Fast forward to today, now at 48 hours CT. this time withdrawals are so different and mild I am completely mindblown. Out of the last 48 hours, I have slept a minimum of 20. I was worried about the RLS again, but I have only had a brief, hour long episode last night that was manageable. My worst symptom has been body aches and exhaustion. Some chills and runny nose, but relatively mild so far. 

I am so confused. This time, despite only using half the amount I did last year, I have been using 6x longer. Now I know I am in the very early stages, but I was expecting a lot worse by now. Potentially this time is different bc I have much more potent helper meds than last time (high-ish dose gabapentin prescription, delta 8 & 10 vape & flower, high dose vitamin c, compared to essentially nothing last time). 

I'm sure the worst is yet to come, and I am still expecting it. I fully understand I'm nowhere near out of the woods yet, but I honestly figured by 48 hours, I would start being in the worst of it, but so far I am baffled. Sorry for the long post, but anyone else have a similar experience? 

If you made it this far in the post, thank you for reading. I wish you all nothing but peace and love.

Wishing it could be day 13, as i quit on Oct 30th but took one small dose on Nov 3, about 10% of what my daily intake has been.  Honestly don't regret taking it, but I also would definitely not recommend doing that.  It did help me sleep, which i had not gotten any during the first 3 nights.  Slept 5 hours after dosing, and that felt good, but i woke up with withdrawals coming back on and the craving to take more was even worse than before.  Good thing that was the last of it.

Here i am now, on day 9.  I don't think the dose really affected my w/d progress other than for maybe 8 hours, so it maybe set me back that far in terms of physical w/d. Anyways, during the first 7 days, i didn't sleep at all other than after that dose.  It was quite possibly the worst week of my life.  I really didn't think i could do it.  Then, finally, i fell asleep on night #8 and woke up feeling.. okay? idk, not good but definitely a little better.  Well things keep getting better a little bit at a time.  The last two days i felt very positive about things, honestly think i was in a pink cloud for 36-48 hours.  Woke up this morning back to reality a bit.  Things are more boring, i'm anxious, i don't want to do much, but i do feel so much better than the first week that deep down i do want to do stuff.  It feels so amazing to leave my house with a bag of powder and a spoon in my back pocket.  Like seriously, it actually feels like FREEDOM.  Don't get it wrong, I know there will be a long road ahead.

I spent the last 2.5 years wanting to quit, trying to taper, doing anything i could.  But realistically i didn't do everything.  The last step was me coming clean to my parents and asking for help.  I told myself for a long time that i didn't come clean because of shame, but ive realized that that's bullshit, and i was not ready.  Well, this time i was definitely ready.  I made sure that this was what I WANTED.  And i did want it.  If i didn't have accountability from my parents or this reddit page, I would still be lost.  THERE IS HOPE!

I think I'm finally ready to quit.,"I take more kratom than anyone should, about 20-30g/dose, 3x a day, but I'm tapering down after the last incident. I'm currently at 15g 2x a day. I've been on it for 6 years, except for a 32 day period when I was in rehab. 

What happened is I took the normal dose and you know those kratom spins and shakes you get when you take too much? Those were multiplied by 100 and I started shaking, stuttering and getting dizzy. The first time I was at work and was suddenly stumbling around which caught my coworkers' attention and they made me sit down and called an Uber to take me to the hospital. At the time I didn't think it was kratom related and I was really scared

The second time I had gotten home from work and took a larger dose than normal (instead of the usual 24g I took 30g and vomited. I started walking upstairs to get a trash bag and suddenly collapsed on the stairs thinking I was having a seizure. My vision was extremely wobbly, I kept trying to stand up which caused me to fall back down and hit my head on the stairs and wall and chipped a tooth. I tried crawling back to bed and hit my head on the floor falling off the bed. I tried to take some cbd oil and spilled it everywhere. I couldn't even lift my legs or arms up for 2 hours, and it was another hour until I could stand up. It was terrifying. I had carpet burn and bruises all over my body for days and my dad saw it happen and thought I was overdosing or having a seuzure. 

This last time I was at work and took the usual dose, the same amount I took that morning with no problem. In only 20 minutes I was super dizzy, 20 minutes later my head was shaking so bad I couldn't lift it off the wall, and realized I couldn't stand up I was shaking so bad. I was in my chair laying back and every time I moved my arm it fell back down and I was sitting there terrified that everyone at work would see and call an ambulance. People started noticing and I finally said I was having a panic attack and asked to be allowed to sit and calm down. I was stuck in the chair for an hour before I could get up and was exhausted, dizzy and scared the rest of the day.

After this last incident I realized it was caused by kratom and I've been lowering my dose to the lowest level possible that won't cause withdrawal.

Anyone else have this happen? I know I'm taking huge doses but every time it's happened it's been the same dose I usually take, if not a tiny bit more. Maybe it has something to do with kratom being a diuretic and causing a drop in electrolytes or blood sugar or something.

Regardless, it's terrifying to me and I think I'm finally ready to taper off and be done with this shit. I'm a recovering opiate, benzo, alcohol, cocaine and amphetamine addict and I finally realized I'm not truly sober. I work in a rehab and am starting to feel like a fraud giving clients advice and claiming clean time while being addicted to drinking 3 ounces of putrid opioid sludge every day to stay well. No matter how much I eat I can't get past 114 pounds, I'm losing hair at 26, my skin is pale and I feel constantly tired, dizzy and emotionless. I throw up sporadically at least once a week and am constantly nauseous. I just feel gross. I've lost interest in things like art, love and friendship and sleep 12 hours a day. I never thought kratom could damage my health so much and I feel so stuck.

16 months ago I went to rehab to get off benzos and kratom and felt amazing after the withdrawal ended. I gained 25 pounds, regained interest in life and felt so good. I started taking kratom again the day I got home from rehab and tried to only take it sparingly. Obviously it didn't work and within a month or two I went from 6gpd to my old dose of 90gpd. I got skinny again, started sleeping all the time, and felt like a piece of shit when my family and friends would tell me how happy they am that I'm sober. And when I started working at a rehab I felt like an even bigger piece of shit bringing a thermos full of kratom to work and drinking it in the bathroom. I'd go back to treatment to get off it but I'd lose my job which I love so so much. 

I know this was a long post but I had to put it out there and vent. Thanks for reading. I'll update as I continue to taper. Also i have hepatitis c which may contribute to some of the things I mentioned.

Been browsing this board for a while, and just wanted to share my story, hopefully as a bit of accountability to myself. Sorry for the potential length. :) I've been using kratom for around 5 years at varying amounts. When I first started, I was taking it for my RLS. Stuff does wonders for it honestly, and I hadn't had any kind of RLS while on kratom for years. Initially I was just taking it before bed at night, and it was great. Somewhere along the way I decided to start taking it during the day just to help me relax more. In hindsight, that was a terrible decision and something I've come to regret.

&#x200B;

For the past few years, I've been at somewhere between 15-20 GPD, no breaks. The kratom never really made me feel negatively, but at the same time I feel like I was taking it for no reason. It got to a point where I was taking small doses every 2-3 hours, and I'd sit at my computer watching the clock for when my next dose would be coming up. I felt normal this entire time, but it just seemed unnecessary.

&#x200B;

Around 2.5 weeks ago, I noticed I started getting random spasms and twitches throughout my body. None of them very big or constant, but it was happening enough where I was concerned. After reviewing my diet/supplements/recent changes, etc., I thought the only thing that might be causing them is the kratom. After doing some searching, I saw other people had developed similar symptoms from kratom, so I decided to reduce my overall dosage with the intent to quit entirely. 

&#x200B;

At the time I was at probably 18-20 GPD, and because I felt like I was taking kratom for no reason most of the time, I decided to cut that intake by over half. I still felt fine and my RLS stuff was still gone, so I figured I was good. Turns out, not so much. A couple days into this, I developed this massive headache, had problems with digestion and diarrhea, my appetite tanked and I had constant nausea. I didn't make the connection it was the reduction of kratom causing these problems at the time, though I had considered it.

&#x200B;

A few days after getting sick like this, I had a panic attack. This is something I've never had in my life and I had no idea what was happening. Two days later, panic attack number two. This was Wednesday night, and because I had 2 of them in a short timeframe, I took myself into the ER. I thought something was potentially wrong with my heart, so I wanted to play it safe. While at the ER, the doc in the building had asked if I was taking anything, and I told him about the kratom for my RLS. He asked if I had changed my intake at all recently, which is when he said he thought all my symptoms were withdrawal, including the panic attacks. After getting home from the ER that night, I decided I couldn't take any more kratom.

&#x200B;

Before going to the ER with panic attack #2, my last dose of kratom had been at 9PM that night. Two hours later is when the panic attack happened and I took myself in. Yesterday (Thursday), I felt OK all day, until around 5-6PM when my RLS kicked back in. I dealt with it for a while, but the longer the night went on, the more insane the RLS became. I've never experienced it so bad in all my life. It started in my legs but then eventually spread up to my upper back and was hitting my arms. I legitimately couldn't lay down or sit down or be still for more than 2 seconds. I tried as much as I could to just deal with it, but at around 3:30AM I gave up and took a small dose of kratom to get rid of it. The kratom worked and the RLS went away after about 30 minutes, and I was able to sleep for a bit. Then at 5:30 this morning...panic attack #3.

&#x200B;

So now it's 6:30AM and I'm still a bit jittery from the last attack, but I know now I absolutely can't take any more kratom, it's fucking me up too much. My real worry is the RLS, I don't think I can handle how bad it was if that happens again. I have an appointment with my doctor on Tuesday, but that's a long way away. In hindsight I should've tapered off better, but I can't really go back now since it would mean going back up to 20 GPD again, and I have no idea how my body would even react to that. It seems like kratom is triggering these panic attacks even at low doses now, so I just need to quit.

&#x200B;

Hopefully the RLS can be managed once it kicks in again, but I'm pretty worried about it. I guess we'll have to see what happens, but the dose I took earlier this morning needs to be my last.",22,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44342464}"

I stranded myself here with no way out for this reason. I'm going nuts in withdrawal. My story is pretty fucked- and I dont blame kratom entirely but the way I used it (to mask and medicate other addictions) was recipe for absolute trainwrecks. I can't think right on the stuff. I lose all motivation. I can't fuck my girlfriends right. I can't find any energy to maintain a clean and healthy life routine or exercise or do anything really- and it sucks the money right out of my bank account. 

I lost my family and thousands of dollars- fucked up university in a field which was my dream- sure I could blame kratom but there were other factors as well. Kraton always seems to lead back to alcohol and harder shit to which I have no defense. I feel shitty going to 12 step meetings on the stuff. I've messed up so much.. its sad. I wish I could turn back time but I just can't.

So here I am again. Day 2. Can barely sleep- am tossing and turning and soaking the bed sheets. I am thinking of getting on suboxone. Maybe extreme yeah, but thats just how awful I feel rn and life looks bleak. I can't talk to my daughter either. I'm feeling hopeless.

I have a problem.  I take 2-3 OPMS Black shots, (which are stronger than Gold), at a time.  I call this a ""session"".  I have a session once every 48-72 hours and I can not break this habit.  Once I'm over being pumped up about quitting, the temptation of a heavy OPMS high seduced me, usually I feel  sick or disgusted with myself within an hour or two of taking it.

I used to be a daily Kratom user, then quit for a couple years.  Once CT from dosing 20-30 grams per day of plain leaf (never again), and another time I quit gradually via a slow taper.

This current addiction I have to shots is psychologically hell.  I am ashamed to not know how many times I have told myself ""last one, last session"" only to find myself at the smoke shop right as withdrawals from the massive dose finally begin to get a little better.

I take these 48-72 hour ""breaks"" so that I won't become ""addicted"".  Truth is I am, because I can't seem to stop.  I find myself swearing that I don't want to anymore, reminding myself how my life would be better if this crap didn't exist, and looking forward to the day this drug isn't dominating my mind.  

The physical withdrawals are unpleasant but bearable, I make sure to take at the very least 36 hours between sessions, even then I of course still notice withdrawals.  Many would say I'm circling the drain and daily use is inevitable, but this pattern began at the start of the pandemic when my stress and depression spiked and now I can't break this ridiculous loop I've found myself in.

My current plan is to have Sunday be my last session, because a Sunday without OPMS and football seems unbearable at this time.

I know people recommend going for walks and being out in the sun, which did feel good for a little while. After being out most of the morning I was getting a headache and felt bad. I went back home, ate a big meal, and crashed out for 3 hours in the afternoon. I woke up feeling minor withdrawals, probably similar to how I would have felt before when waking up after not dosing for 10 hours. So much better than the wd I felt while tapering and the first 2 days of CT! It strangely feels great even though I am totally still in withdrawal, just not nearly as bad as before.

Feeling anxious and sweating a ton. I don’t want to turn on my a/c because I can tell it’s really not that hot. Drinking a ton of water. I eased up on the vitamins but still took ibuprofen for a minor headache and some Vit C. I will take magnesium before bed.

I just did some light weight full body circuit exercises and yoga. It made my heart rate feel uncomfortably high after the weights, but then I felt good during yoga. I still feel anxious and am prepared for another really bad night of RSL but I shouldn’t need to do much tomorrow. I might try to go to the gym and lift heavier weights tomorrow and see if I can wear out my legs. I ran stairs earlier and they feel like they should be worn out after all the squats and lunges, but I’m already feeling like I need to move them again. I changed out my yoga mat to a clean one figuring I will likely need to do some poses during the night.

TL/DR: Day 3 withdrawals feel like ""normal"" daily withdrawals I used to feel when taking my daily doses if I went without dosing for a while. Feels so much better than the wd during tapering and Days 1-2 CT, so I'm feeling pretty good about it. Ready for another bad night since I still feel very anxious and am sweating profusely.",4,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.7852106}"

Honestly after a few months I lost all the cravings for the drug. I was taking around 12-15 GPD everyday for at least a year. The withdrawals were fucked, couldn't sleep at all for like a week or two. When I discovered Kratom, I thought it was a miracle drug with no side affects or potential for addiction. How wrong I was. I wish I could say my life is great today, but as an addict I've dealt with alcoholism for the past few years and am recently sober from that. But, I will say that not having to take a shit ton of capsules every 4-6 hours of every single day just to function is a huge relief. My one question is, will my hair ever come back? I'm only 25 and now have super thin hair. Prior to Kratom I had thick fast growing hair. Now it takes forever for me to grow hair. Idk, maybe my hair problem isn't Kratom related? Anybody else been off Kratom for this long and not noticed hair growth. One of the motivating factors that made me quit was my hair. Anyways, just wanted to say that if my fucked up addictive personality self can stop Kratom, so can you!

I was shoveling down 2-3 heaping tablespoons down my throat multiple times a day. I was taking it,  like so many of us, for a boost. I thought it was helping me focus. Haha!!! And we all know what happens...In the end of my use I was a shell of myself. I was suicidal,  felt and looked terrible,  was going into withdrawal if I didn't dose...I'd wake up and immediately dose because I  woke up feeling like shit. I jumped without any help or knowing what  I was in for. I vomited for 4 days, body temperature swings were constant for a long time.  My husband  and son had no clue what was going on. I finally  told them somewhere in the 1st week.  They were about to force me to go to the er. (In hindsight ...might have been  a good idea) 

One of the most important  things I've learned here is that everyone has their own timeline.  I'm so happy for the people  who are posting they feel back to 100% after 45 days (or whatever that number may be) but it's also frustrating  knowing that I'm not going to have some magic number where I wake up and be perfect.  I'm trying to find joy and happiness  in the small things. I'm working  on myself. I'm seeing mental and physical  therapists. PAWS is exhausting but I'm improving and it's small steps. Anxiety is very present.  

Physically,  I still have issues with food. I have only had a handful of  solid 💩. Certain  foods smell, and taste like chemicals. My hair is filling back in and seems less brittle. I can see better. I'm not getting light headed.

It was such a wonderful replacement for alcohol. I really liked how it made me talkative with my wife after coming home from work…which she loved! 

I took 4 grams once a day from Friday through Monday. Everything seemed better. I could even go shopping with my wife and not be tired! I noticed every once in a while I would get easily irritated. I called this the Kratom clap. I think it was because I felt so comfortable that anything that would try to interrupt that comfort kinda pissed me off. 

After learning more about Kratom, I realized I could drop my dose to about 3 grams a day, rotate my strains, and feel something almost every time. I brought my wife in to enjoy the experience. At first I had her try it so she could cope with family events. She loved how it made her peaceful and happy. She started taking it everyday (something I thought I would never do!). We both justified it since we felt it was much better than consuming alcohol on a regular basis. I eventually started taking it every day over 2 years ago. She started taking small amounts throughout the day. I started taking it twice a day last year and then really loved taking a third dose a couple of hours before bedtime. 

Then I began to think about my life. I knew it wasn’t good to be hooked on something for the rest of my life. After some self reflection and  hearing a podcast on addiction, I knew I needed to quit…at least for a month and evaluate from there. 

Why quit? I was becoming a weak, irritated zombie with no drive in life. I was becoming content with doing nothing. I was fooled into thinking Kratom made me stronger and better. My wife and I both noticed a difference in each other and it wasn’t good. I started reading this forum and was encouraged by all the testimonies of finding clarity! 

Last month I switched to stem and vein and tapered from there. It was crazy to see how much my body wanted and felt relief with only .50 grams of stem and vein! 

I am now on 1 week of being completely clean. I have already experienced bouts of good clean energy. I know have a bad cold. It’s weird. I never had a cold when I was on K and now that I quit, I have one. Oh well. I’m climbing out of the hole and feeling better. My wife is on day 2 and not doing so well.

I've felt truly and successfully quit for a long time now, but thought I'd check in just to motivate those of you that are having trouble. I wanted to quit for more than 2 years before I successfully did. Now it seems like that was a different person. 

Things absolutely suck at first, and they do absolutely get better. For me, it was about 4 months clean after a 4.5 year habit before I really felt properly good, but after about a month I already felt loads better than on kratom.

My physical and mental health are so so so much better I can't even describe it fully. I've lost 30 pounds. I'm relatively happy after contemplating suicide towards the end of my kratom use. I've been back at the work I thought I couldn't do without kratom for 3 months and I'm performing much better, and have energy at the end of the day. I exercise regularly. I haven't drank in almost 4 months.

I did 14 weeks of CBT and I've been on Cipralex 10mg for 7 months. However, I pursued this after being off kratom for about 5 months. Couldn't recommend professional mental health support enough. So much better than self medicating. 

It wasn't easy to quit. Physically I did a long (~2 month) taper from 15gpd down to 750mg before jumping. I have done a ton of work changing my habits and it was pretty uncomfortable for the first while. What kept me going was knowing that kratom wasn't working anymore.

If been using kratom since about 4 years but most of the time it was just one of many drugs I took when the time was right.
I’ve always been interested in pharmacology and all things “mind altering” and saw myself as pretty informed.

About when covid hit, I had a pretty rough time staying motivated with my studies and over the next few months my long term relationship started to fall apart too…

I turned to alcohol which is abundant and pretty normalised in the country/culture I’m in, but knew it destroyed me.

When I was not drinking I would take Kratom which I realised would allow me to still be more or less productive and do „mentally challenging“ things. 

Fast forward to about one year ago, and I was taking Kratom pretty much every day.

I soon realised that I kinda lost my happy attitude which I loved about myself. I also lost my drive to do things that I would normally enjoy, especially on a social level.

But I allways thought to myself „hey, at least you do something don’t you? You might not be happy about anything you do, but at least everything feels kind of ok and bearable!“

A few months ago, I started to take it more than once a day…
And I lost all motivation to do pretty much anything if I hadn’t taken the right amount at the right time before.

So many fucking things went through my head why live was the way it is for such a long time. Why didn’t i feel real joy anymore? Why was I so apathetic?

It took me way to long to figure out what it was, even though I think in the back of my brain I always knew.

Currently on day 2 CT.

Thank you all so much for making me realise so many things!

Fuck it, we got this!

I started off small, maybe 2g after work. I was working from home so it became easier to start my first dose earlier and earlier in the day. I started taking 1g doses starting first thing in the morning, then throughout the day. My last dose would be before dinner, so by the time I woke up the next morning I would be feeling withdrawals.

I realized a while ago that I was physically addicted and using it as stress relief. First steps were to keep track of how much I was typically taking, about 10 gpd, although I know it would be more if the day was stressful. 

Once I figured how much I was averaging I tried to taper down 1-2g every few days. I did this for a few weeks but felt terrible the whole time and ended up going back up whenever I needed to be functional. 

Now that lockdown restrictions have eased, social gatherings made me want to quit for good. I tapered hard starting two weeks before having to meet friends for lunch. I tapered down to 2g a day for a few days but felt really bad on those days. I didn’t make it to being clean – I ended up taking 6g that day to avoid feeling like shit while being with my friends.  

After that day I decided to just jump off. So I’m on day 2 of complete CT.  

Have been in bed a lot but not sleeping well at all. Most of the time was spent trying to focus breathe to try to keep the RLS under control, but it hasn’t really worked. I kept having to get up and do body squats or jump around. I think I was in bed for 10 hours for the first two nights but the RLS was so bad I was in a state of half sleep most of the time.

I’ve quit Oxy, suboxen and kratom multiple times in the past. I got through those very hard years in my 20’s and had quit for a number of years. At 32, I decided I wanted to pursue more schooling and ‘make something out of myself’ so I applied to graduate school. I got in. While I was in graduate school however, I picked up a kratom habit (again), after getting through so much before going back to school. I was so disappointed in myself but it was the only way I knew how to get through the stress of demanding academic deadlines and tests. Fast forward almost two year and I finally am quitting again after taking huge spoonful doses about 4-5 times a day. I got a job as an auditor at a casino and worked for about a year after graduating until I got an opportunity to work for the state as an auditor.  Well that didn’t work out as it was all remote and I just couldn’t keep up with the work, especially when factoring in the kratom use. My short term memory is shit and I was having trouble concentrating. So I quit the job with no financial plan to get by.  So I decided I finally wanted to be free of the addiction, so while simultaneously stressing about needing to find a job, I am starting day one of withdrawal. I gathered all the half empty bags of kratom I had left and threw them (literally) to the wind in a dramatic act of empowerment and self reclamation.  I’m supposed to be looking for a job but fear the next week will be hard to get through on its own without having to worry about money.  I have a great group of supportive friends and thought posting here might expand my support system further.  Any advice on how to deal is welcome.

The Kratom was however giving me constant anxiety. Like insane shit had a fear I was going to choke on my food and made it extremely hard to eat. Had a fear I was going to swallow my tongue.  I legit lost weight because of that shit. Decided I was done with it and started tapering. Even though it's so much work decided to make up thousands of capsules and take one capsule away each day. Started my taper at like 18 grams when I got down to like 13 I started feeling irritable and felt like I was sick. I'm now at 11 grams and it's weird I feel 100 percent fine now and even feeling good when I dose even though I felt nothing taking 18 grams. I guess my body has just adjusted to the lower amounts. I also at this level have beat that crazy mental health stuff no more fear of choking. I wonder why high doses can mess you up like that. It wasn't just after I took it either. It was constant irrational anxiety. I know it's going to get harder as I go down. But I'm feeling good now. My taper is subtracting .66 grams a day.

I use 2-3 days (not much, maybe 8ish grams) in a row, then the most I make it off is 2 days.. the highs and lows are driving me to madness, but even sometimes when I feel good on day 2 since it's not too much usage I still say fuck it and that's where I mess up. When I feel bad it's easier to give in. 

I was using 50gpd back in 2019, and slowed that usage down, but never actually stopped. Now I just leave myself on this roller coaster of stopping every few days and feeling horrible  just to drink it again to feel horrible again in another 2-3 days.

I know we talk about hair loss a lot here, and really it sounds like all we have are anecdotal stories- but it’s clear that hair loss has occurred for a lot of us.

I have gotten a little obsessive over the hair on my head the past few weeks and went down a rabbit hole comparing photos from years ago to now. It’s interesting because I was a daily, low dose user for 3 years and my dose got even lower in the last year, but I noticed the hair loss just over the past 4-5 months or so.

For those of you who lost hair, at what point in your use did it happen? Does it come and go in cycles (since there are natural cycles)? Did it happen immediately when you started, when you increased your dose? Or just gradual? Any thoughts would be appreciated.

I am using rogaine and rosemary oil, but I’m sure the cessation of taking kratom will help the most. I’m 25F and I still have a decent amount of hair but I can tell a difference. I feel like the more I think about it, the worse it gets. :(",6,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4898584}"

I've noticed some nasty nausea issues cropping up, and we think kratom could be contributing because it's insoluble fiber. Honestly, I'll try anything to get relief from the nausea, vomiting, and bathroom trips.

I'm well into the morning now, and lo and behold--less nausea. Only one bathroom trip. I even ate breakfast which is rare.

It's been a year now since I stopped using kratom and this community saved my ass.  My gratitude can never be fully expressed.  Seriously, I might not be here if it weren't for this sub.    The entire story is too long, but I'll give the salient points.    I didn't use all that long -- 1 year of use going anywhere from 10gpd to 20gpd with some breaks of 21 days in there before caving in and going back.   

It reached a point where the kratom was just making my physically ill to take and I just had no choice so I stopped.   I was aware of the lack of sleep and the acutes as well as the horrid anhedonia from stopping 21 days here and there, but this time every thing was WORSE.  No sleep for 10 days.   I didn't have a lot of other opiate-like withdrawal symptoms except the something was horribly different from oxies, subs, methadone and other classic opie withdrawal --- I did not know where I wanted to be or even who I was anymore.  I felt nothing for nothing -- it was a hideous anhedonia that gripped me.  I would drive hundreds of miles to Maine just to do something and not even leave the car -- turn around and come back.  I looked at trees and imagined hanging ropes over them.   The entire experience bled my soul white.   

This 'feeling' or symptom took a month to dissipate slightly, but the anhedonic, joyless state lasted for 4 months.  Over those 4 months it receded imperceptibly daily -- progress was very difficult to measure, but it came!   I'm tired of typing, but believe me it did pass.   After the anhedonia -- I was 'good' or at least back to a respectable level of joy or at least potential to experience happiness of some kind.   

Now, I WISH I could say I stopped everything and all is beautiful.   Nope.  I have no desire to mess with opies or kratom EVER!   I still have a habit of dipping back into certain exotic things, but only for a day or so and I PAY DEARLY.   I think I'm done -- seriously with everything.  No substances 'work' for me anymore -- I just pay a steep price even for 3 days.  Even weed confuses things.

Oh well, that's the story -- please hang in there -- love yourself.   I know what it's like to toss and turn in bed until you ache and you can't imagine you can stand anymore AND you have to go to work or deal with family, etc. -- scary, scary stuff!    Life is much, much easier without drugs, it's that simple -- I'm not preaching -- let's just say for me it is.

Then I drank 3 beers, still nothing. Then I remembered that I found 1 x 0,5mg xanax and I took it and slept like 3 hours. The days before I felt ok during the day, just very anxious. Now I feel absolutely terrible, like I’m about to break down. How tf is this possible, how can’t I still fall asleep on day 15! I only used for two months, but in high doses (25-35gpd).

I feel like I’m going to go crazy if I don’t get some sleep. Last time I didn’t sleep much, I ended up in a mental hodpital with severe OCD. I’m sure it’s going to end that way too if I’ll go multiple days with no sleep. Idk what to do. I can’t tell my psychiatrist that I got addicted to something, because he would likely stop giving me scripts for my ADHD medication that I desperately need at least for exams, or I might as well drop out. I’m totally fucked rn, Idk what to do.",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8577588}"

Im a poly drug addict with multiple vices since a young age. I got in a lot of trouble as a teenager with drugs and alcohol.

Im currently 24 with a year sober from oxycontin. And i truly do belive that kratom has helped with that. However im ready to get off of it. It's just trading one addiction for the other. Im currently on day 24 cold turkey after about a 9 month habit at about 10-20 gpdand extracts thrown inthe mix for the same duration.  The paws do last long i must say and im struggling with cravings every now and then. The withdrawal isnt nearly as bad as true opiates. However it seems like it last longer mentally. I am feeling much better though minus the lingering depression and aedhondia. But i do feel im getting better. Its just a long withdrawal in terms of the mental aspect. kinda like coming off methadone or suboxone but not as intense. Just drawn out.

I need help and advice.,"So I posted last time that I was starting a CT from about a year of 20g usage a day. Well I didn’t come back and check in, didn’t reach out for help… so at the very beginning of day 6 I relapsed. The funny thing is I was just starting to feel better!!! Wtf. The insanity of addiction is so insidious and powerful. 

Ended up taking the Kratom for 3 days then starting CT again. Made it like 28 hours then was with my friend at a kratom bar (didn’t know those existed and didn’t know what I was walking into) So I broke and said I’ll try one kratom drink. I felt a tiny bit from it but barely nothing. Anyways it just gives me anxiety because I had to start over again bc of a stupid drink.

MOST IMPORTANT PART: I am back on the wagon I am not giving up. Today at 6pm was 24 hours from the kratom drink (that really did absolutely nothing .. not even sure if I should be counting it but whatever. So I’m on day 2. I took time off work and basically messed up all my time so I’ve got 4 more days before I go back to work. I’ll be going back to work on day 6. I really want this so bad and it’s embarrassing that I can’t get it. It’s so different from street drugs it’s like a milder but waaaayyy more drawn out withdrawal.

QUESTIONS: 

1. How did you guys feel on day 6? I’m freaking out about work bc I’m a server, have to interact with people and it’s very physical. I feel like I might still feel shitty on day 6.

2. Do you think that kratom drink affected my progress?

3. When does this end 😕 I’m really struggling this time around. Could use some support. Thank you guys ❤️",13,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6678725}"

I didn’t look at anyones personal case story or road to quitting just the symptom list, considering I already have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, ( GAD ) I figured I would just have really bad anxiety. 

Today is day one of my taper to quitting. I took 2 doses today. Morning and 4pm ct. 

In the last by this time is have taken sometimes you to an ounce. 

I tried to get prepared. I got Lipsomal Vitamin C, L-theanine, L-Tyrosine, magnesium, Kava capsules ( extract ) as well as Voacatox which is a natural detox supplement where one of the 3 ingredients is known to help with withdrawal. To top it off ( thc gives me anxiety ) so I got CBD. ( which definitely is nice  ) a disposable vape. 

My body now- considering I took like an Oz a day or 6(ish)
Doses ( spoon-fulls in one of those little cups. ) 

I new this was going to be hard and no pain, no freaking gain, I will become healthier and happier by any means necessary or literally die trying. 

I’m prescribed clonidine for my blood pressure which had helped me in the past with Opiod/Opiate withdrawals ( chills, sweating, anxiety )

Am I over-doing it ? Should I have waited to take the kava and v-tox when I am not taking Kratom.  I figured I’d take this cocktail and a soon in the morning and one a night Just to not go cold turkey. 

I’m not addicted to this,(Bali)
I am dependent on it though. 

My body is telling me I need it like a diabetic’s body is telling them they need to take insulin. 

Now without the Kratom- anxiety, weird burning feeling throughout my body and weird, odd sensations in my legs. 

I can tell you I don’t enjoy these nasty withdrawal symptoms, but saying I’ve been kratom free for a month will make it all worth it! 

Are my at home OTC remedy cocktail too much ? Could this crap be making my stoa worse ?

Could come back, but I think it may actually be gone. I will go 3 days or so in a row without even thinking of kratom. That's because I've been changing my life to be much different than how it used to be. Regular, rigorous exercise helps more than can be stated. I have no cravings, no desire to use now. This could just be a good past week or two and cravings will come back, but again we will see. I haven't really seriously craved kratom past the first few weeks. 

I'm very very glad I made this decision and went though what I needed to go through and continue to. Life isn't perfect, but the way I experience the world now vs how I did on kratom all the time is just night and day. It's still going to take a long time for my reward system to really heal all the way. I enjoy things a lot, like exercise. Sometimes it feels like I'm not enjoying the exercise like I'd usually be, sometimes I feel like I'm enjoying it just as much. Perhaps I'm just overthinking it. There's still some things that I stopped doing while addicted to this opioid that I haven't picked up again yet, mainly photography and writing. I think it's just a matter of pushing myself to do them again because my brain won't realize they are rewarding until I start doing it. 

However, there's a ton that I have picked up again. I'm on decently solid ground and I'm enjoying life at the moment.

I don't know why but I came back one more time and I'm in the midst of using for about 2 months.

Well, I got a new job and start today. My last dose was about 8pm last night, taking it specifically so I could sleep coming into my first day on the job. 

I might be insane to go cold turkey again right as I start a new job, however, I'm going to power through. I promised myself I would never taint my new position with K. If I start using during this job, I'll always use it to get through the day. That's exactly what I don't want, and it's time to take control for good.

Don’t be soft. You’re better than this. You know how unhappy you are when you’re high on this crap. Don’t even think about it.” Motivational speeches towards myself seems to be helping. 

Starting tomorrow I’m going to try 2 doses of 3G every 24 hours to see if this week is any easier. We can do this everyone! If I can completely quit by a month, I will be absolutely thrilled. This crap doesn’t have to hinder us anymore. We can all do this!

WEEK 2:

I feel like I’m actually soaking in life now. Like I’m genuinely enjoying my family and friends and things I’m experiencing and not just a superficial smile. I have so much more energy, I was getting to where I was so tired all the time on K everything was a chore and a burden. Even getting up to take out the trash or something small like that. I can tell that the friendships and relationships that I had are really flourishing. I don’t feel all awkward talking to people and have a lot of confidence back. 

I am still having bad days or bad periods but they are fewer and fewer as time goes on. I think I was expecting to be clean for a week or two and be back to my old self. That hasn’t been the case, it’s been hard but very rewarding. It’s only been three months after 8 years of over 30gpd. I’m realizing now it will probably be a while longer before I’m completely back. I think the rule of 1 month for every year you used will probably be more accurate. 

But overall, compared to where I was 3 months ago, it’s night and day. I’m a different person than I was 3 months ago. I’m back in the gym, starting to look muscular again and not just a skinny shriveled up guy that looks out of It. I’m making sure I stay hydrated and plenty of vitamins and probiotics. I am taking a fiber supplement as well because my stomach is getting better but was in pretty bad shape when I quit. 

Iv also done cryotherapy for inflammation I would really recommend it. It’s helped a lot. I think Kratom was starting to cause some of the lymph nodes in my throat to be swollen a lot, they have gotten a lot better since quitting but cryo and hydrating has really helped.

After 2 years I've known kratom (using with some pauses, on and off), I've decided I'll take this seriously, and hopefully ... with your support :). I've relapsed like month ago and it costs me another money (It's not the first time I've got rid of everything).

I used kratom to ease my anxiety problems - so as you imagine - the next days will be probably crazy, I know I can get serious withdorwals from the previous experiences. I've already prepared for insomnia (melatonine pills), but my stressed guts will probably kill me. I know already, that I can only wait for very dark mood, agression (seriously guys, I'm like a motherf\*%#&@ BITC# when I'm off kratom, ...then I suffer for skin sensitivity, diarrhoea,... and the next first days I probably will enjoy some headache, spine ache,... just... ""off-kratom flu"" :D ...again.

Guys... I'll be very glad If you'll support me. I'm not sure if it's possible without you. It's huge commitment. **I want my life back, the ""REAL ME"" BACK !!** The past few month just mould into one brainfog  and automatic pilot, who supposed to solve problems in my life. Get through job I hate (now on sick pay,... and plan to leave) and anxiety (just more go out, sport, run, meditation, read.....). I want to update here my journey everyday.

Ive used kratom for almost 10years. My daily dose was roughly 2tsp every 6-8x a day. It started with the ""wobbles"" but after decreased dosage (4 doses a day) I was getting vertigo. the last 3 months have been the worst! My dizzy spells were lasting hours sometimes a day at a time, just when I thought my dose was low enough (I took it down to 1tsp 4times a day) the dizzy spell would come again. I finally went and had my ears checked (due to some annoying popping) only to find both eardrums had liquid on them and one side was infected. Took the meds but noticed little change, went back again and was prescribed a steroid and nose spray which seemed to help the spells as well as the popping for a few days. Due to this I've really had to think about my health and how much kratom impacts it. Its hard know what's wrong physically when there are things in my system that could be contributing.

I took 60-70gpd for my last 6 months of use, and used for a total of 4 years. I know my dosage was very high and length of use is also a pretty good stretch of time, so I knew my w/D's would be bad, but idk how much longer I can go without sleep.

Although I said I was done trying Xanax for sleep during this, I decided one more time to try at a higher dosage. I could tell my RLS was coming on strong and felt like another night like that would've killed me. So I took 1.5mg of Xanax, which from my understanding, is a fairly high dosage. I didn't think much of it since I've used 1mg multiple times in the past and literally did not feel a thing, or notice any difference in my anxiety/relaxation. Anyways, that extra .5mg combined with me not sleeping for a week was fucked up. I ended up ""waking up"" all over the house from 12am to 3am. I literally woke up on my inversion table in my basement slowly tilting back, and when I came to it I realized my feet weren't strapped in. I literally could have slipped out of that thing and snapped my neck in half and died. 

I actually knew what was happening at that point and all I could think was ""don't lose your focus, stay in the moment, stay awake up there"" and that would work for a couple minutes, then I'd come to it again in a completely different place in the house. I even had a conversation with my mom while I took my blood pressure at 2am. I had to ask her if that was real because it seemed like so much of a dream.

All I can say is, I was very lucky to not do anything stupid enough to hurt myself in anyway. Glad I got the sleep, but definitely won't be doing that dumb shit again.  Crazy how I've taken 1mg probably 10× in my life and almost never felt a damn thing. No sleep + .5mg more = me blacking out .. who woulda known",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8786804}"

So the first time I quit I went CT and put my body in SUCH a state of shock that I don’t want to do that again.

It’s been two days and I’m over half down on my dose w/ very minimal withdrawal so far. What was the best way to quit in your opinion. No wrong answers. Everyone is different and withdrawal happens regardless. There are just ways to make the experience a tiny bit less miserable.

You don’t care how much money you spend as long as you have enough to get though the week, that you have enough for whatever event you’re having, or enough for an upcoming stressful situation. 

The first time I quit completely for 7 months and withdrawals were torture. Here I am again after I thought I could control myself. I was at the point where kratom was just another thing. I didn’t gain anything from kratom anymore. I lost weight, I lost friends, I lost money, I lost interest in everything. Day 3 and 4 have been pretty rough, dealing with the waves and the little to no sleep. But when I get out of one of the waves it’s nice actually feeling real happiness for once, or to feel the wind hit my face and actually notice it. I’m tired of being ashamed of taking kratom and always feeling like I needed to hide it from people. Music sounds better to me now, and I’m starting to enjoy the little things more. There’s so many little things it takes from you, you don’t realize until you finally get off.

I know Kratom messes with your adrenals, and that coffee as well as stimulants can ""overwork your adrenals"" So maybe the damage that kratom does to your adrenals, plus putting extra stress on them causes your body to go into overdrive?

The crazy thing is a few people have said this side effect has gone on indefinitely. Even longer than a year. So is it possible kratom causes permanent damage/changes to your body? Does anyone actually have an idea why kratom has created so many ex-coffee drinkers? Some people can't even handle alcohol after quitting!

Wondering if anyone could look over my plan and see how I could improve/be given advice and tips on it.","My plan will consist of 3 days of four 4g doses spaced evenly throughout the day. I have extra strong bso caps 1 a day, turmeric 1 a day, heat rub as needed, pregablin for rls and muscle cramps (possibly the worst wd for me). Diazepam for anxiety, use as required, but always the minimum dose possible also to help with sleep if needed. 
(I have just finished day 3 and it hasn't been so bad, not had to use anything other then cbd so far, I have a holiday in 13  days which I want to be completely Kratom free for) 

So I'm think I could do 4 days now of 4g, 3 times daily. I am also thinking if there is a good plan for the pregablin for the muscle pain and cramp? As required? Or lower doses spread out throughout the day? I also have diazepam which I will use to try and get sleep at night time. As much as required first couple nights, then taped it down as fast as possible  as I do not want to get any adverse effects from the diazepam and pregablin. I will also have delta9+CBN throughout. 

That will leave me with a solid 7 days to take the plunge of no Kratom at all, I will still use everything else sparingly and only if I really need to. I do tend to get really bad wd's 

Mainly cramps,rls, anxiety and depression, insomnia
 I will do regular exercise throughout. 

Then my holiday will be 7 days up in the mountains where I can do lots of grounding, walking, meditating etc to really relax and recover. 

Thought-out the whole process I will keep a journal to reflect on, meditate and do yoga as much as possible and stay as active as possible. 

If anybody has any pointers or ways to improve it, please let me know you guys advice :) 

Last thing is I would hate to get stuck on pregab or Diaz, so any info on how long I can use without withdrawal or problems from them would be great.

On kratom I would wake up and feel like shit and have difficulty staying awake. Now once I’m up I’m good just like the good old days. Mentally I’m also great have not gotten PAWS yet. In all honesty I doubt I’ll get them (knock on wood).  What helped me most was exercise and Wim Hoff breathing. As I stated in other posts, it’s all about replacing a bad addiction with a good one. I set goals for push-ups. When I first started I hardly did 6 in a row now I’m up to 30. My point is it DOES GET BETTER. It amazing not having to think about the next dose. It’s like you are free and in control. Ask yourself are you willing to take kratom for THE REST OF YOUR LIFE? If no then you gotta quit sooner than later. The longer you take the harder it gets.

My dosage before quitting: 4-7 GPD, but most days I’d take 2 before work and 3-3.5 after work. So my dose was pretty low. I decided to quit and tapered down to 3 GPD for about a week and a half and then jumped.

Well guys, it’s been pretty great. I feel so lucky. I have slept 8 hours both nights, and my only symptoms are a little dizziness, skin crawling and sweating a little. That’s it so far. I have actually felt happy and more present since I stopped taking it! And music sounds AMAZING!! I know I’m not out of the weeds, but wow! If anything, let my experience be a promotion for tapering/getting your dose as low as possible. I’ve been able to go to work and kick ass all week. I also normally take supplements, eat healthy and workout 3-4x a week, so maybe that had something to do with it. No idea.

Kratom made me miserable and demotivated, especially toward the end. It made me drop out of college, isolate, lose my friends and prevented me from making new ones at school because I was so introverted and focused on getting high. I started using it really heavily when i quit weed and alcohol for probation. Although i still smoked pretty much daily with some breaks, and drank occasionally, although I didnt enjoy it as much because hangovers are so much worse and I just take kratom and puke all thru the next day.

Then I finally quit. I was completely out of money, jobless, depressed, unhealthy, had 0 prospects, no real friends, 0 sex life, no interests. And for a month, I didnt do much but smoke weed, and I started getting back into my hobbies and feeling better. That is untill i started drinking a 6 pack every night, and just ended up replacing dosing kratom all the time with alcohol. 

Then, 8 months into that quit, i also decided to stop drinking daily, and of course in 2 weeks i took kratom again, because why not? i was bored, lonely, and needed some sort of reward for the suffering i had been enduring. At least it wasn't booze. I took it for a month then quit for 12 days, then took it for 2.5 weeks, quit for 12 days, took it 2.5 weeks quit for 4 days took it 4 more and now we are at day 3 clean lol. 

Thinking about how i should be at 11 months, and if i just stuck with the not drinking, or quit after that first withdrawal 3 months ago even makes me sad. Im stuck in this fucking loop, and altho my life is so much better today than 11 months ago, Its still so fucking far from where I want it to be, and I can only really enjoy a life like this if im numbing myself with drugs and alcohol daily so I dont have to face the reality of my situation. 

I dont want to endup like the people around me, I wanna get out of this shit town (moving in january:)) and pursue the dreams ive had for so many years but have neglected due to the easiness of indulging in the instant pleasure that drugs have to offer.

I dont really want to accept the fact that im going to be completely sober for the rest of my life, but I definitely want to be kratom free forever. It brings nothing good into my life, except for making it easier for me to be lazy and keep me from becoming who I am supposed to be.

I was a 70g/day user. It initially saved my life from heroin, but after around a year, the negative side effects really became apparent. I isolated. Kratom initially made me very social, but then I felt dumb, uninterested in human contact, became a hermit. And the loss of sex drive? Holy shit! I'm used to that side effect, having been a horrible heroin addict, but somehow, kratom was worse. And the wds! I will admit, I often find some of the quitting kratom posts to be a little alarmist, or deeming a plant evil, simply bc one had negative interactions with it. But after years of heavy use, I was amazed at how bad the wds were. I'd wake up at 4am in full withdrawal, while having worse restless legs than I'd ever had. Anyway, the final straw was when I realized that my hair started to fall out in alarming amounts. I'm 43,so I thought maybe I was going bald, though I've had a full head of hair? It got so bad, everywhere were these inch and half hairs, and what hair I DID have, looked strawy and sick. My hair has almost fully recovered now. I can tell it's still thin, will probably take another 6 months to completely heal, but it's already SO much better.

I went from 21 caps to 18 caps on Oct 8th (6 x 3) = 9g

Finally I went from 9 caps to 6 caps on Nov 1 (2 x 3) = 3gpd

Right around here I've started to experience some fairly bad waves of anxiety.  For some reason I didn't think it was from the kratom taper initially, because I didn't notice a thing tapering down by half over the first 2 weeks, but I guess that's typical in a taper (vs going CT).

Now here's my issue.  I thought things were a breeze, until this anxiety hit.  Now I am wondering, am I tapering a bit too quickly?  If so, would it be best for me to go back up one step of my taper?  Or should I perhaps try taking 1 extra 0.5g cap 2-3x per day if I start to feel the waves of anxiety?

I've gone through alcohol withdrawal a few times before and I tend to have some pretty bad physical symptoms, but not much anxiety.

I've got some BSO caps and Ashwagandha caps coming today.  I take magnesium, multivitamin, C, D, B100 complex. 

tldr; I went from 12gpd to 3gpd over about 4 weeks and my anxiety is through the roof!

I am okay tapering longer if it means this anxiety goes down subtantially, but will it just draw it out longer?  If I could quit without this anxiety by tapering over the course of 6 months, I think I would, at this point!",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.60213864}"

Hey all. Just wanted to tell everyone that’s struggling to jump that it’s possible. You will get there. As the days go by and you keep using, it seems there’s no end in sight. It will happen. There may be more suffering before it finally happens but it will happen. Hopefully the type of pain that happens isn’t something irreversible. 

I’ve been on Kratom for over five years. 50gpd. I had a period of quitting for seven months then relapsed two years ago. These past two years of using I could NOT seem to quit or even get three clean days. There will come a point when the stars align and you jump and when you do fight like hell to not look backwards. Keep moving one day at a time. One hour at a time. It won’t be easy but I can tell you it’s easier than the misery of having your soul trapped by this drug. I’m feeling pretty good at this point. Not completely normal, but good. It’s either face all the thoughts and troubles of life head on, or keep escaping. Escape is easy until it inevitably catches up with you and manifests as anxiety and depression.

The physical symptoms lasted a while… I didn’t sleep for 27 days… (And because some asshole called me a liar, I’m editing to say that I could only sleep for about 5-10 mins and then my body would jolt awake. It was a bit torturous) and the first real sleep I got was about an hour and it was wild. I was wide eyed and my mind felt hyper but my body had zero energy. The leg pain, RLS, lack of appetite, racing thoughts, chills, and fatigue were my worst symptoms. That and the feeling of wanting to jump out of my body.

I’m wondering what K will be like in comparison. Because for me, I start feeling like crap if I don’t have a dose by hour 4/5….  I don’t understand how some people can get down to 1-2 doses per day. I’m dosing 4.5g every 4 hours. I have 5 doses per day. 

I’m trying to stretch the doses to every 5 hours but it’s been hard. How am I going to do this if it’s hard for me to get past 4-5 hours? My dose starts to fade by hour 3 and I just hang on from that point. I’ll try to take a nap but my body is restless and jittery. Wtf.

I really need to get off this evil crap. I take tablets so it’s easy for me to just take more to feel better but I have not. I’ve been consistently stretching and lowering. 5 tablets is 1.5g. I need 15 tablets each dose and I’m just so tired.

Any advice? Any comparison between H or M withdrawal vs K? I know I can do this, it’s just hard when I have to be on point for certain things. It’s harder to stretch myself when I have something important I need to do so sometimes I’ll end up dozing at hour 4 instead of stretching it to 5 because I have an important meeting/appointment/call. It gets in the way.

 I thought I had taken my dpla again in evening and it seemed like my pain and cravings were coming back and just though oh well they probably just work for a week or so and at least it got me threw the week.

Woke up this morning all achey so decided to see if maybe I had taken the vitamin c instead and thats what it was.I had apparently megadosed on vitamin c instead.I heard vitamin c also helps with withdrawals and it wasn't as bad as it usually is with body aches.It does seem to help a little but the dpla helps tremendously, absolutely would recommend trying it.

Plus a taper tip for anyone else,"Hey all, so this all has been going on a long time. I’ve struggled with addiction most of my life. Last year was the absolute worst and I went to detox twice for alcohol. So I got out last November and then quit alcohol, then tapered myself off Xanax, then tapered myself off ambien and then tapered my kratom from 30gpd down to about 2-2.5gpd. I had a little blip the last 6 months because I was in a toxic relationship. I started drinking again (not crazy like before but def not healthy amounts), my kratom use increased, hell even my nicotine use. Anyway I’m a week off alcohol again and luckily my kratom use only went up to about 3-4gpd. So I’ve tapered myself again over the last few days and am down to 1.5gpd. I want to be off this and all substances by Christmas. I realize the only time I’ve had a deep belly laugh and was my normal outgoing, funny, goofy self was for a couple days in detox. I’ve literally spent the last 5 years addicted to kratom, taking it every 3 hours and im over it. I’ve become anxious, antisocial, and numb. I never felt like it made me numb or different but it’s becoming clear to me it def has. I just wanna feel like me again. Hoping im strong enough to see this through. Also a tip for anyone tapering: when your withdrawals peak, for me it’s usually about day 3-4 after a drop, that’s when you should do your next drop. I know it sounds counterintuitive, but you won’t really feel the next drop for a few days, so if you drop on the bad day then by the next day you’ll start feeling better and you’ll feel mostly normal right before the next bad day. This will keep your taper progressing quickly without getting stuck at the same dose trying to get your body to stabilize. Just my experience.

I'm currently bored at work and have a little bit of time to kill so I've decided to give an update as to where I'm at in my journey.

I'm very happy and grateful to be 38 days off of Kratom and 34 days off of cannabis and all other substances. I picked up my 30 day key tag from an NA meeting recently! 

So! Obviously I'm not dealing with acutes anymore, so that is a blessing. And just a little information: I used kratom on and off for 4 years (since I was 20). In the beginning it wasn't that much of a problem. Until it was. That was about two years ago when stuff got real. I went from 6 capsules a day, to about 12 capsules a day, then to about 20 capsules per day. And sometime after that I quit. And then when I started again, I bought an extract shot. And from that day forward I was hooked. 20 dollars a day on Kratom, and then to 40 dollars per day. And then I lost count because I was taking leaf kratom and extracts in different amounts every single day to self medicate. After 20,000 dollars debt from kratom and other drugs, ER trips, and a 70 day trip to rehab that started in May of this year, I used k and cannabis again at the end of my treatment. After detoxing, residential, therapy, and groups for a couple months, I flew home and became deeply depressed and bought kratom. I let my family down once again and still haven't regained their trust.

Fast forward to the end of September, I threw in the towel and enough was enough. I need to get my shit together. On the 25th of September, I gave up kratom and cannabis on the 29th. I've been 100% sober ever since. I'm very glad I didn't turn back to the harder things I was using.

Before I went to treatment I lost 55 pounds and had sores all over my body. My mom said I looked like I was being poisoned and wouldn't live long. Honestly I probably wouldn't have. And out of all the drugs I've used, KRATOM had one of the biggest holds on me for years.

I have since gained 60 pounds and I'm a healthy 24 year old guy at 6'2 and 202 pounds.

I'm starting to get my energy back and I'm finally starting to sleep a little bit better. I still have a long way to go and PAWS is definitely doing it's thing. 

If I don't hydrate, get enough sleep, and make proper choices for myself I start going in reverse and I get depressed. Making the hard right choices and doing the next best thing is going to give me a second chance at life.

So if you're struggling with PAWS or acutes even. Know that this too shall pass. If you want to feel better and PAWS are kicking your ass, hydrate, get more sleep, do something to make yourself feel better. We do not take good enough care of ourselves nowadays.

I want everyone who reads this to discover their self love. I hated myself just a few months ago, my self esteem was gone. It's not where it needs to be, but meetings, recovery, and self care are changing my life.

Please don't let kratom or any other drugs rule your lives. There's always a light at the end of the depression, anxiety, and self-hate if you do the right thing and seek that light!",25,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.43516207}"

I talk to myself all day about this constant battle, and I am running out of hope. 

I’ve been struggling with Kratom for almost 5 years now. 

I just had 25 days under my belt. But even thought things were looking up, I took on too much with a job that was just way too demanding. Be it side eff effects from quitting Kratom or my usual terrible insomnia…I completely fell apart and had to quit a week ago. 

Quitting naturally sent me down a more intense spiral and alcohol and adderall worked their way into everything. 

This is my Day 2. And the hardest part for me is that I have no one I can truly confide in. I wish I could just tell someone exactly what was going on.  But instead…I’m laying here in an apartment I just moved into without a job…counting the days to the end of the month where I will be well short on my rent.

If that happens, I’ll have to go home and that’s the last thing I want to do. But I guess what I want doesn’t really matter anymore. 

What’s so aggravating is the stupid stuff doesn’t even work for me. Like on it, I’d still be just as unproductive, but with a sense of peace. But to everyone else, they see the same lazy slug one way or another.

It’s so hard to not want to force my body forward…I object “there’s no way this is because of Kratom” and insist I should be normal on day 3. And yet, I don’t even honestly know what I’ve done to my body. Even today, you can barely find any actual facts on what it does to your body. 

It’s stupid because if I stop…my mood almost always recovers in under two weeks. And every time I feel better I can’t believe how amazing normal actually is. I vow to never let that stuff into my body and then sure enough it happens again. 

I’m sorry guys. I just feel like this is the only place I can honestly be authentic. This is a scary, scary place to be. And I’m tired of being trapped. 

I just need to know it’s going to be okay. Even if I have to go home…whatever I have to do to become free is worth it. Because there’s no point going forward an addicted mess.

In the meantime, I just thought I'd say hello to all of you, wish all of you well on your journeys, and humbly ask for any words of encouragement and/or advice.

Day 44 of my total quit/taper.

3rd time trying.

I haven't slept in over 30 days.  I take these little 20 min naps here and there.

I try to excersize as much as possible and for me I'm limited in what I can do.  I can still cycle so I do that 

I have been for 5 years.  My personal best time on a common climb was 5:49.  I put everything I had into that climb to hit that mark.  While using alot of kratom

Today 21 days clean, feeling like dog crap I ran a 5:29.  I wasn't even breathing hard..  I couldn't believe it and chalked it up to maybe a good day, but I wasn't tired at the end of the ride so I did the loop again and pushed it to a 5:14.  

To me that's amazing.  I'm actually already physically more capable than I have been in last 5 years.  Despite being 20 lbs heavier since I got fat trying to quit this sludge I ate alot of junk to stave off cravings.

Another problem I need to deal with.

So that's the good news.  But there is bad news too.

Yesterday I went to taco bell, which Is my favorite fast food joint.  I ordered my usual and they told me they don't have any chicken menu items anymore.  I lost my marbles and literally freaked out, screamed at the lady, I took that pretty personal. 

Looking back I can't believe I did that, what is wrong with me.  I'm dealing with rage issues that I never had before. Like real bad.

Rage and being fat.  Not a good combo.

I won't lie, the first 2-3 years was amazing and kratom helped everything from workouts to making basic tasks more enjoyable and helped stave off illness when everyone else was getting sick. But like anything, the honeymoon can't last forever, but the problem is/was I was the last to see it. For the last 2 years or so I was struggling with a really short temper and having a difficult time finding joy in things. I simply used Covid as the excuse and believed it until my wife and kids started to call me on it and even then I was able to find a way to blow it off. 

Then 3 weeks ago my mom called me and out of the blue asked if everything was going okay and I was taken aback and said it was and why was she asking. She unloaded on me about how ""cold"" I've been with everyone and that I seemed depressed and lost the ""light"" in my mood. I finally realized that there was only one thing in my life that this could be attributed to and that was my kratom use. I decided then and there I was going to be stopping for good.

We had a trip to Mexico booked the week after for a big celebration party for a friend and thought it would be the perfect time to taper and stop because the beach, friends, etc would take my mind off of it. So I started breaking off .5 grams going into the week of the trip and would continue to taper while there. This ended up being terrible because I spent 2 days with full flu like symptoms and was incredibly achy and had stomach cramps that wouldn't let me sleep. By the 3rd day I was down to 1g a day and started getting the lethargy but I hid it with multiple expressos throughout the day and of course having drinks with everyone. By the end of the trip I was still tired but aches gone and decided once home that would be cold turkey time.

This was 8 days ago and I loaded up on Black Seed Oil, Tongkat Ali, and Magnesium. I will say that these supplements made a HUGE difference as I had 1-2 days after CT where I was restless and wanting a dose so badly but I resisted and now that feeling is gone.

Day 9 today with no kratom after 5+ years and I actually feel lighter and less stressed than I have in a long time. No worrying about when to dose or how, and my mood is actually feeling back to what I remember. My daughter even mentioned it today. I can't wait for the next days and continuing to get back to who I really am without the addiction over me.

However by day 8 i was suffering extreme mental withdrawal.  Full of anxiety and depression.  I was suprised at how bad w/d from kratom is for me.  Ive been addicted to H and pain pills and don’t recall the w/d this bad.  BTW i was only on kratom for 4 mos and had a hard time taking t breaks.  So i went CT.   Like i mentioned by day 8 i was really struggling mentally.  I had some leftover 2 mg suboxone strips from when i was on it for 3 years, and the w/d from subs  was rough but i got thru it.  I decided to take a 2 mg sub and it helped greatly. I took another 2 mg the next day, skipped a day yesterday but was having a rough morning today and took another 2 mg suboxone today.   My main question is does anyone know after taking it for 3 days if I’ve developed a dependence on it? Or should i be ok if I don’t take anymore.  They were hell to get off of b4 but i was on them for 3 years.

Quitting CT resulted in a few days of hell, but I managed. I was surprised to have such serious withdrawal symptoms from such light usage.

It's now been a month and all the symptoms are gone except I get debilitating anxiety every afternoon. It starts with a rapid, hard heartbeat, followed by my body heating up and some dizziness. If I don't medicate with gabapentin and benzos it turns into a full blown panic attack.

It's really awful and I don't know if I can keep living like this. I'm really scared it's never going to stop. What can i do?? I'm getting close to beginning to dose a gram or two when I feel the anxiety coming on. I don't think I'll relapse and start using multiple grams, multiple times per day.

This is the first time I've tapered. I usually go cold turkey, but I'm so exhausted mentally and physically that the thought of intense withdrawals is more than I can bear right now.

I have to say that I only find tapering to be marginally better. Props to everyone who can step down without getting symptoms. It's just not me. I'm still out of energy and either unable to poop or it's all I do is poop. I was taking about 6 extract shots a day. I've got it down to about 12 bittersweet grams per day, give or a take.

I'm thinking I may just go cold tomorrow. My fear is that even tapering is wearing me down a bit. I don't want to get down to a low dosage only to find I'm too exhausted to step off.

I started with a big cut down to about 8 or 9 gpd split in two, which definitely caused WD symptoms and was difficult enough to slip up to 11 grams on a handful of days. Been at this dose for maybe 3 weeks, and I'd dose as soon as I woke up at 6:30 from cravings and morning discomfort, and be itching for that second dose by noon. Then suddenly 3 days ago I made it til 11 am without even thinking, only took 2 grams rather than 3.5 or 4 for my first dose, and easily made it til 4pm for my second dose before taking again only 2.5 instead of 4. The next day was the same, and today has also been the same. I'm even sleeping relatively fine. 

I'm just confused, this casual lack of concern over when I can next take some and absence of intense craving/justification to take more is completely new.

I have been taking 10mg powder P/D plus 7 or 8 fresh leaves for 30 days (I live in Thailand).  My first ever experience with Kratom.  I want to quit tomorow but I am anxious about the WD's.  I am an ex tramadol addict - I used to take between 35-50 x 50mg trams per day on and off for 10 years and have done CT WD's off them many times, which is mind blowingly hard but I got through each one.  The last few WD's were very, very tough and the final one put me in hospital a couple times over a week.  Im getting older (48M) and I just dont think I have a CT WD of that level left in me.  I honestly think another CT WD of that scale will tip me over the edge.

I am hoping however that 15-20MG kratom each day for 30 days is not a particular high dose, and the WD will not be too bad?  The Tramadol abuse was about as high as it can get before dying, trust me 35-50 pills per day is INCREDIBLY high abuse.  Most serious tramadol addicts would take 6-10 pills per day.  My kratom consumption by comparison hopefuly is more low end?
