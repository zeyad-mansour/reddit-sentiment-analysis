Doesn’t seem like much to many on here but I’ve had a HELL of a time with the insomnia... like couldn’t sleep for 5 months... if I didn’t take ambien—- AT ALL.  I began taking kratom again a month ago (small doses) to get of the ambien,  ( I know- stupid!!!) I was just losing my shit. I wanted to die when I couldn’t sleep- I just wanted to function somewhat normally during the day. About a week ago I just I stopped taking the kratom. It’s kind of funny this time- I never got nausea from kratom, this time relapsing I would get it randomly... also the mood swings. Wow... I wanted to divorce my husband a few times a day even though he’s a wonderful human being. Kratom is such an addictive substance ... you keep chasing that high but usually you will end up losing. I regret the day I found this drug. I’m not 100%- I know I have a looong path ahead of me, but for the first time in a long time despite my sleep despair I feel GOOD. Tired, but good. I hope all of you find the strength in this new year/decade to walk away... thank you for all of your stories. I continue to check back into this reddit every time I’m feeling weak...

2019-12-30 21:19:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/ehwa61/very_slowly_getting_better/,Very Slowly Getting Better,"The weekend flew by, I barely remember it.  All I know is that I spent the entire weekend sleeping, listening to music, smoking weed and lying around.  It happened so fast and now it's gone.  In fact, my Monday has gone by pretty fast.  This is my 3rd week in withdrawals after 2 years of off and on abuse.  My latest stint was daily use of about 30gpd in one big dose.

It's been shitty to say the least.  When I went I to work the morning it went by really fast but then I crashed into a wall.  I went from feeling decent to extreme exhaustion.  It lasted about an hour or 2.  I had to get up and move around.  I started talking with people to help pass the time.

I am no longer in exhaustion agony hell.  There has been improvement.  It's now spurts of energy followed by lethargy.  I haven't experienced any intense euphoria as I sometimes do, but I will occasionally, very briefly, experience feeling good.

I can occasionally feel restless and uncomfortable.  I've noticed that I am peeing a lot more.  It will wake me up at least once or twice in a night.  I'm not even drinking a ton of water.  I can tell my body is doing some serious healing because when I was on kratom I had trouble peeing sometimes.

The best way to describe how I am feeling is that I really feel nothing in terms of emotions.  I am just sort of blah.  I have no interest in anything and zero drive.  The best energy I can muster is to get high and maybe play a little VR.  However that really wears me out after about an hour and I have to sit down.

This Friday will mark 21 days.  That's a huge feat.  I am hoping by this weekend that my energy will make a sharp comeback.  I would consider stopping smoking weed, but it's the only thing that relaxes me in the evenings and makes things interesting again.

My ultimate dream would be to see my drive and energy make a comeback.  I'd like to get back in the gym and start eating healthy again.  Maybe this weekend I can make that happen again.",6

Was on kratom for a year(25GPD) at the end of it. Never was into opiates started kratom because I wanted to stop drinking 4 beers every night. I quit cold turkey 22 days ago it was hell withdrawals suck still not past the PAWs. Been taking lots of supplements to help with mood and sleep. Here's the deal I slipped up today and took 2 extract pills in the morning and took 2 5 gram doses. 😵😰🤢 I feel awful deep down inside about it, and I am wondering if that means all my hard work is in vein and if that means Im completely back to square one and will have to go through that terrible physical detox I went through for a week of straight stuck in bed. I dont have any experience with w/d at all I was only a recreational user of a few things like pot ect... kratom is the first drug I became 100% dependent on. If anyone has any information or knowledge they can drop or experience rather please let me know! I want to continue to get my life back quitting was the hardest challenge and I don't want this relapse to put me right back in a hopeless situation. I have also been going to the program since I quit. Its hard for my to relate as alot of ppl there were really down and out, stealing for their addictions, losing their families, jail time ect... I never was like that and part of me dosnt feel hopeless and powerless. I was able to quit for 3 weeks on my own without any of those bad things happening because I didn't want to continue taking it for years on end, and had been telling myself I had to quit after a year. It's difficult because of the PAWs, the lack of energy and depression, the physical symptoms I got threw and after 3 weeks was completely past them and even sleeping okay but it was the PAWs that made me relapse today because I just wanted to feel happy and energetic but honestly in the end I just feel worst, just numb and not anymore happier. I am really hoping that this mistake isn't going to cause me serious physical withdrawal symptoms. Anyway thank you everyone here this forum has helped me immensely leading up to me quitting I have spent loads of time on here reading so many threads and posts, so much amazing info and strength on here. Thank you all so much!!",2

Naltrexone has a way lower risk profile than any other drugs, even tylenol, and he still wouldn't prescribe it. When I explained this to him, his eyes glazed over.

A tiny backstory is that from about 15-24 I had an on and off addition to norcos. Went to rehab, got off with the help of subs when I was 22. A year later I had emergency stomach surgery that put me back on pills and back on my bs. Again was able to get off with subs. Then I was diagnosed with fibro and had heard about Kratom and we all know the rest from there. I have been on 16-20 grams per day and need to stop. This is killing my husband and me in return. He does not understand addiction and how it’s not that simple to just stop. Now onto the questions. I take capsules (two different types) on a pretty specific schedule. For all but one dose I take three caps. 2 are 1.5 grams each and one is 0.5 grams = 3.5g, except for a mid afternoon dose I do of 2 pills 1.5 and 0.5 = 2g. I NEED this to stop and writing out a slow taper seems like it will take months and idk if I have the willpower. Sorry this is so long, I’m obviously new here. Would subs hurt or help? And would dropping the 2g dose at first and then dropping the 0.5g pill off of each dose one by one work? 
Current schedule:
7ish - 3.5g
10:30 - 3.5g
2ish - 3.5g
4 - 2g
6 - 3.5g
Occasional 8pm (usually weekends) - 2g

My kratom of choice was the green, for that euphoric sensation.

I found that switching to “bali” or the red kratom is a better taper for me, as it prevents the WDs but also does not give me that green kratom “euphoria”, so I’m not chasing that all day.

IDK why, but here's what I've been doing...","So this is my 3rd day (technically this afternoon) but normally by this point I'd be in agony, and to tell you the truth I feel pretty ok. Some fatigue and a little woozy but I slept like a rock the first 2 nights and didn't have sweats or anything. I don't know why this is happening but I'm taking it as a blessing. I was using up to 50g a day for like 2 years (with a month break and some week long breaks in there) and I quit CT. I just thought I'd share what I've been taking in case that's the reason:

Gabapentin: like 900mg every 4 hours or so up to 3000-4000mg, more at night if needed, didn't really need it though.

Cannabis vape oil (distillate): this is a highly concentrated form of THC and I've been puffing on it pretty much non-stop. Also regular (high-grade) flower.

Clonazapam: I know, I know it's a benzo and they are evil, but honestly they are helping so much right now, and I don't plan on taking them after the first week or two. My dad is actually nursing them out for me, I take 1 mg once or twice a day (usually only once) I know how addictive they are so I'm keeping in mind that the feeling they give me is very temporary.

Multi-vitamin with food: I've been eating more regularly (was basically annorexic when on k) and taking a men's multi once a day.

Magnesium Glycinate: I had this leftover from a previous quit. I found It works best if you have something that you have to do (stimulating for me) 

Rest: I took the week off of work, and the lack of stress worrying about going to work is making this almost anxiety-free. My boss is really cool too and told me if I need more time off that would be ok.

Music: I used to DJ (not professionally, but I did play a few festivals) and I picked up mixing tunes again, MUSIC IS INCREDIBLE AGAIN! It's mind-blowing how much beauty we sacrifice numbing ourselves with kratom. Im having a blast playing catch-up to finding all the good new music!

My family: As crazy as fuck as they are (Italian) I love them to death, and I've lost a lot of hostility I've been holding against them. Kratom made me very judgmental, like EVERYONE was obnoxious and i couldn't stand anyone. Not the case now, I actually enjoy the company of others.

Friends: I hung out with my bestie and got really high, I've been neglecting her and it felt good to REALLY reconnect. I explained to her that I haven't been myself and I'm trying to be the person I want to be and she was so supportive. PEOPLE WANT TO HELP! All you have to do is reach out!

Video Games: This is a weird one cause I thought I was going to lose interest since it was my favorite ""getting high hobby"" turns out I enjoy them even more! Such a great way to pass the time, I loaded up Skyrim and have been enjoying that game more now that I'm clear headed. 

That's all I can think of, I just wanted to express my gratitude to this community, you were all my inspiration to do this, so thank you! If anyone out there is struggling, please reach out, to me even, I'm happy to help. If you are scared to quit, I understand but just do it, you will find It's easier than you would think it would be!

Much love,

I have little fear of returning to Kratom, though of course the possibility is always there and I'm aware of that. Now however I have entered the awful phase of near 0 physical effects of WDs (other than GI disturbance which is a pain in the ass literally) but absolute INSANE apathy. Guys I haven't felt apathy like this almost ever; I don't care about anything at all. Just getting dressed and driving to work feels like my day of work already, let alone actually getting through the day. It doesn't help that I'm not entirely thrilled at my job; i've been here for a few years, but deep down I know it isn't the perfect fit. The issue is its a sales job and relies on me speaking with people and keeping quota each week - but mostly I just want to sit in a corner and cry. I started exercising over the weekend; I hope that helps. How the fuck do I get over this? I suppose hands of time is the answer, and the only answer?

IT’S NOT THAT BAD!!,"I just wanted to offer some encouragement to all those who’re struggling like I have been. I’m on day 4 and it’s totally doable. It sucks but you can definitely do it. If you’re as fed up with this green shit as I have been, you can do it. I know it seems impossible but it’s not. This thread scared the shit out of me. But having gone through the worst of it it’s not as bad as most these posts make it seem. 

I have been a daily kratom user for the last 2 years 20mg-60mg a day user. I would just compulsively take the shit whenever my anxiety flaired up. 

Tried the taper method but I’m an addict and therefore have no self control. I’m sure it could work with an accountability partner. I finally had enough and decided to cut it off on Christmas Day. Had the last 4 days off so I saw an opportunity to be free from this green demon and made the jump. 

Day one was a breeze.
day two was a little bit of chills and mild anxiety, was able to work out. 
Day two night hit pretty hard but by morning day 3 I felt good.
Day 3 had chills but felt good enough to workout and run some errands. 
Day 4 higher anxiety but less chills and sweats, worked out and cleaned a little. 

I took valerian root, bcaa’s, 5htp, Tylenol, Advil. 
Not recommending this for anyone, this is just what I took to help with my withdrawal. There’s a ton of information on the best supplements to take online. 

With all that being said keep your head up! This green power does not define you. I know I’m not out of the woods yet, I still have a ton of work ahead but I’m going to stay strong and fight this green fucker with all I’ve got. There is hope! If I can get this far so can you! Hit me up if any of you have questions or just need to talk. I’d be stoked to help if I can In any way.

In my experience no supplement or anything can help withdrawals as much as high intensity exercise (in my case it was sprints on a treadmill).. if you can muster up enough energy to exercise I say do not hesitate. 

When I was sprinting it felt like a was running for my life, running away from the kratom and into another world. 

This may sound strange but because I was severely lacking dopamine through my withdrawal from kratom over stimulating the receptors or whatever.. I could literally feel my brain healing itself and increasing neurotransmitters etc. Also the endorphins from it make me feel just so great.

Now I run daily and make sure Im panting for breath and sweating by the end of it. I always used to lift weights religiously but that wasnt enough for me. Running has saved me.

The runners high or whatever the fuck it is I feel after a session of HIIT beats the kratom high anyday!! 

When Im running and after it, feel such a high its actually addicting. And theres virtually no side effects. 

Exercise is the most overlooked thing when it comes to mental health IMO. Doctors would rather prescribe meds than prescribe a workout plan.",29

I apparently didn’t learn my lesson the first time and started taking it again in June 2019 and just started my taper yesterday. I am scared of quitting CT this time, because I remember how horrible my withdrawals, anxiety, RLS, insomnia, depressed feelings was the last time and it drug on for months! I can’t deal with that type of withdrawal this time b/c I work full time, have 3 kids, and crap todo! Yesterday I started tapering. I looked up a plan to taper and figured up with the hubs that I usually take around 16gpd. I am planning to wean my self down every single day .5 g. Does this seem to fast? Should I wait a few days and do 1g instead. I don’t won’t to be dealing with constant withdrawal symptoms because I work at a school and don’t have the time to deal with that crap or time to take off work. Thoughts are welcome and if you know of any supplements or something that would help the horrible insomnia, restless legs(that make we want to cut them off lol and only appear at bedtime), excessive sweating, and horrible stomach cramps and spasms please let me know!

All i can say is that I am an addict, I would look for anything that would make me feel good.  Starting kratom was exactly that, legal, natural, no addiction  potential.  That was all wrong for me.  It at first gave me a boost, euphoria etc.  Then my dose escalated, and I found myself, sedated and sleeping after taking it.  First, I tried to stop, but my withdrawals were, akithesias, irritability, and anxiety that would only be relieved by taking it again.  I was in recovery for alcohol and knew I was at a turning point when I thought drinking again would help me.  Oh, the insanity.  I sought, searched high and low and I found a physician who is licensed to treat addiction.   Initially he wanted to enroll me in an outpatient recovery program.  I protested because it would require that I take a leave of absence from work and then there was a 3 month post recovery living situation.  Finally he agreed to provide me with suboxone on a very tight schedule.  I was made accountable by submitting to a test for remaining off kratom.  Yes there exists such a test!  I was joined an NA group.  I felt so blessed, as I listened to the horror stories of fellow travelers recount detox in county jail with absolutely nothing.  I heard of the GI issues, the muscle spasms the restless legs, the insomnia the terrible anxiety that ensued.  I thanked my compassionate physician for his help.  It has been over a year now, and I feel so grateful, I continue to go to NA, as well as AA and I continue to share my experience, my strength and my hope.  Incredibly I still find some people who enter into NA and swear that if it wasn't for kratom they'd still be using opioids.  I hold no opinion or cast no judgement on their experience.  I only know for me and me only it was my opiod.  I continue to come back here every so often for more messages of hope from all of you.  I can only share mine, blessed beyond belief.  Thank you all my fellow travelers, peace and love to all.",9

And of course your mood decreases noticeably, anhedonia, low motivation, and return of my severe depression and brain zaps. Even after 2 weeks, my mood and fog was still pretty low.

Just to preface I was stable on Effexor and Wellbutrin for 10 years, but then some unfortunate events in life brought back my depression. I know those 2 meds (which I’m still on) are heavily involved with serotonin, and so is kratom to a degree. Which would explain why quitting kratom could bring back my depression  possibly worse than before, along with pretty heavy brain zaps. 

I’m wondering, for anyone with a similar SSRI x Kratom experience , how long until the brain zaps and mood issues start to improve again? And also what specific supplements, herbs or OTC meds could help with the process. I’ve tried  magnesium powder without much improvement. I’m considering loperamide (though I’m not sure what it does for withdrawal) and another sub mentioned ashwaganda or hayuacha or something like that?

  Im am so much better at my job without the Kratom. Its insane the difference quitting that shit has made. Before I quit, I was isolating from all my coworkers every day. I wasnt looking people in the eyes and I had the WORST anxiety every day that dosing didnt even cure. I wasnt fun to be around, I was halfway productive. I was suffering from bouts of vertigo which made my anxiety so much worse because it always felt like I had been on a boat all day or just gotten off an elevator. Feeling the vertigo daily really screwed with my mental health. Working is NOT fun when you are holding onto the table in front of you to stop your vertigo everyday. I honestly cant believe I worked like that for as long as I did. I put myself through SO much anguish by putting off my quit.

The past 2 days Ive been having fun working with my friends. I love these people and Ive known them for a while but it honestly feels like Im seeing them for the first time in a LONG time instead of just 4 weeks. Im connecting again. Im smiling again. Ive had more real genuine conversation with my coworkers in the past 2 days then I have in the past year. My manager hugged me and said how good it was to have me back. Multiple people have come up to me and said they were proud of me. It all gave me a HUGE boost to my self esteem and really just made me feel so good that I had finally decided to do take control of my life back. It was just what I needed and the biggest breath of fresh air Ive had in a while.

 This withdrawl has NOT been linear and Ive struggled alot.  Just 2 days ago I was having a hard time getting out of bed due to insomnia making the depression a real hurdle. Some days I feel alright and other days I dont.  A bit of suffering is to be expected though. Im glad I quit and Im glad I held strong through all the shitty days when I had to hold onto my seat to keep myself from fucking up. I quit smoking a while back and honestly its been hard not to pick that up again too. I know that the paws is most likely not all the way through and thats okay. Having some good to take with the bad makes a ton of difference. For the first time in almost 40 days Ive had a great day.  Hoping the same thing happens for everybody on here that hasnt felt OK for a while. Keep moving foward and Ill do the same!",19

I was using for almost 3 years, and the past 8 or so months I had upped my dosage to about 15-30 GPD.
 I was going to be away from home for 5 days, so I figured that would be a great time to just go CT, so I did. The day I got back home on day 5, though, I took about a 5 gram dose to take the edge off. That was my only day home before going to my wife's parents place for another 6 days, so I didn't think it was too big a deal to take that one dose. The next few days were hard though, mostly with the RLS. My wife's dad uses kratom, and I think there were 2 separate times when I woke up in the night asking my wife where her dad keeps the kratom, but she was fast asleep and didn't really answer me, thankfully. I didn't want to ask her dad at all myself either, so I went the whole time without any. 
I got back home last Thursday and I took another small dose, then my wife dumped the bag in the trash for me. So it wasn't entirely CT, but so far it seems like the worst of the physical problems have passed with the exception of terrible diarrhea. I suppose technically I'm only 2 days clean right now, but I went from such heavy use to what I'm at now, and I don't plan on ordering any more at all, so I think I'm doing alright. 
I guess now all I have to do is wait for my stool to return to normal and hope the PAWS doesn't hit me too hard. I'll be honest though, I didn't really want to quit, and I still kinda don't, but I was starting to see where I was going with my usage and I needed to stop. The biggest thing was that it was ruining my sex life with the loss of libido, but I've gotten that back already, so it's more than worth it to get that shit out of my life. 
This subreddit has done a lot to help me and guide me and I hope it continues to help others. Thanks everyone, and for those of you still fighting, keep it up. It seemed impossible at first, but now it might be one of the easiest decisions I've ever made.",6

I was a kratom 3xday user for 4 years 25+grams a day. I originally started because of bad premature ejaculation. It worked great. I only had sex once a week and my wife(now ex)was never into seconds so I wanted it to last longer. It also lessened my libido which for me always good so I didn’t use as much porn. Anyways the last year I was doing around 30+ grams a day for 6 months then down to 18grams for a couple months then 9 grams for a few months. I experienced a lot of failures in the bedroom over November so I tapered down the rest of the month and quite. Today is day 27 days without any. Withdrawals were easy for me. I feel more emotionally stable now and feel fine. The only thing that sucks is my low libido and weak erections. I started working out a lot about a month ago and was taking some ashwaganda and red Korean Ginsing. For the past 2 weeks I wake up with firm erections every single night. So that tells me everything works down there. I learned that nocturnal or spontaneous erections have nothing to do with arousal but awake erections do.  The problem is during the waking hours i can only get 9-10 hardness about 15% of the time with the girlfriend or by myself for that matter even with Viagra. At first I thought it was mental but it is the same ratio if I “test” by myself (I don’t fee nervous or anxious just not a whole lot of feeling or desire. Mentally I want it bad though. I don’t hardly use porn anymore but even if I do the ratio is very similar( little desire or feeling like I am forcing it). The other 85% of the time I can only get to about 5-7 out of ten hardness not quite good enough for sex. Now here is the crazy part even if I pop 100mg Viagra it doesn’t seem to make up the whole difference. So I am thinking since I get hard during sleep the blood flow and nerves are fine. I even had one night while sleeping were it was a 11 hardness for 20-30 minutes without me doing anything(felt like a teenager again). I am thinking my brain still has to adjust from all the chemical dependency to start getting arousal and libido to return to normal while awake. I don’t feel a lot down there. It seems like too much kratom and I couldn’t go off and a smaller amount actually increased libido but zero kratom or too low killed libido. I am 40 and about 10% body fat 6’5” 195lbs, pretty fit been working out 5 days a week for 1 month now(took about 3 months off; worked out most of the last 10 years), no chronic diseases of any kind. I don’t use any other drugs. I used to use phenibut every other day at 1.5g for 4 years but I also quit that 2 weeks ago(since I never used it every day or multiple times per day I didn’t feel any withdrawal from that). I read people always says the libido comes back but it is frustrating when even Viagra cannot be trusted. I tested my T levels back in October and they were 181. Before kratom about 5 years ago it was almost 700. I am going to get them tested again soon to see if they have gone up. Once in a while I will have strong feelings down there and things work perfect but it is like a slot machine. I just wish it all came back sooner. I hope I am not one of those that take months or a year to return to normal.",2

First of all, there is no 'high' in it. Taking it to mitigate post-kratom miseries won't substitute another problem.  It's hard to explain how it feels. Other drugs give you a pleasant feeling which suppresses the misery of withdrawal, but can lead to 'chasing' the new drug.  Theanine seems to work differently. It doesn't fog you out or push your withdrawal symptoms down out of sight temporarily. Instead, it seems to quietly dissolve your anxiety from within. You don't really feel anything happening, but at some point you realize that you are simply OK, and aren't missing the kratom.

I didn't try it during acute withdrawal, but it would probably help. Where it really helped me was during PAWS. I was mostly clean but kept getting those subtle ""go ahead and dose again, it's no big deal"" urges. Theanine washed them away.

It's often sold as L-Theanine, and it doesn't cost a lot. Theanine is one of the active ingredients in tea, probably why people drink tea in stressful situations.",9

For a little bit of background, after a surgery months back (that actually created chronic back pain) I started taking a mild pain medicine for pain, for about 2 or 3 months or so on and off. Shortly after that I stumbled upon kratom and took the extracts daily for about a month. I went through horrible withdrawls, and never want to do that again. I never had a problem quitting, as far as willpower goes, so the severity of the physical withdrawls took me by full surprise. But that's over, thank god! 

But now, about 2 months later after a revisional surgery, I was given a hydrocodone prescription to take as needed with pain and they arnt working at all! Is this normal? Could I have burnt out my opiate receptors, if that is even a thing? Or could it be because of something in the extracts I was taking before i quit? It's very perplexing.

If I can do it anyone can stay at it !! I relapsed many times and hated it each time ! 💯🙏🏾",28

I just wanted to stop in and say hi. And I just need to vent, I guess. Things have been tough for me lately, I have gotten a bit depressed over the holidays due to stresses from work, raising a family, and money. I found that after a 3 week trip in November, I was drinking every day. Not much, a beer or two, but I realized that I had made a habit it from it out of boredom. Before that it was Marijuana for the 8 months or so leading up to that. After I had quit Kratom 578 days ago as of today, I really worked hard to not have a crutch to help myself feel OK. I am STILL working on that. Things are IMMENSELY BETTER NOW without Kratom. Seriously. But boy is it hard when so many people depend on you and you just can't deliver because you are struggling. I am doing this for my family. 

So here's another reason for the post: while cleaning on Saturday last week, I found a package in my garage that had a few old empty kratom bags, and some agmatine that I had from before I quit. After finding it, and thinking about how low my state has been recently, I found myself capping up the dust that was in the bags. I found that I had almost 3 grams worth of red vein in the bags. I capped them up. Then I sat at my desk. Then I thought about my family, and how proud I was of myself for quitting for my unborn son last year. I love that kid so much. I got up and flushed the 3 caps down the toilet. 

Holy shit it is scary how easy that would have been to just start right back up again. I will not. I refuse. What's more, I am now going to face my other demons and really try to get at the roots of my addictive tendencies. Why can't I ever just be myself without having some kind of substance or destructive outlet? 

Could it be the ADHD medication that I have been on for years?

If I quit it, will I fail at being a provider and a father due to being unable to keep myself together to get work done? Ugh, THESE are the hard questions that I need to answer over the next few months.

Good luck guys and gals. Seriously, quitting kratom was one of the best things that I ever did. I don't regret it for a minute. Happy new years. Don't give up: This is a process. It's a process becoming addicted, and it is a process of learning how to live without it. Love you all.",20

He's not divorcing me - yet. I also was so freaked out before I told him that I called a hotline and spoke to one the counselors. There might be a place in Seabrook NJ that takes my insurance, but that's not very close to me (I'm in Long Island, NY) and my husband won't have any part of it. He thinks I can taper, but I don't think he realizes how long a taper can take. I started my taper already by cutting out one capsule early this morning and 1 capsule with my most recent dose. That will be it for today though. I think I will need to dose 3 more times today. I'm so confused right now. The counselor of course doesn't think I should taper without medical supervision. That has me a little frightened. Any thoughts or suggestions? Do you really think I can do a taper alone? I need to be able to work during this process. Is there any reason I couldn't do this on my own? Oddly enough, today isn't as bad as yesterday, but I think that's because I told my husband and at least I'm not freaking out with this terrible secret. I'm so lost & broken; I still hate myself for what I've done. I don't know what to do! As I'm writing this, the facility called me and told me insurance would cover the cost of detox, but my husband thinks I can do it alone- so he won't go for this. Please some help here!",8

Stay strong everyone, it’s not worth it. And don’t give it any more power than you can absolutely control... it doesn’t hold you unless you let it, so if you’re going through acutes or you’re craving it... just welcome that feeling and embrace it as progress is my advice, it gives you the power instead of it.",5

Last time I quit for 48 days and was on 50mg per day of naltrexone. It helped, I didn’t have cravings, and I lost weight. Problem is, I lost joy in most things I did. I stopped exercising, I stopped playing video games, I stopped being interested in sex with my wife, and in general I was just miserable, but hey, at least I wasn’t on Kratom, right?

Anyway, I’ve thought about 25mg a day and giving that a shot, but I’m worried I’ll have the same negative effects and turn into a zombie. Is LDN the happy medium that could help with cravings while still preserving the joy I’m supposed to get from life?

Any input is appreciated!

Thanks!",2

Day 5,"This CT quit has been really different than other attempts.  First, I am doing it at home with my husband’s help.  I bet right now he wishes he had sent me off to my friend in Hawaii (quit #1, lasted about 4 months) or got me a room at the ski lodge for 5 nights (quit #2, lasted about 5 months).  Every other attempt has been basically a total failure, never lasting more than two or three weeks and returning to prescribed opiates which run out and I return to Kratom.  I’m disgusting.  

The physical stuff has been bad, especially insomnia, anxiety,vertigo, and suddenly yesterday (Christmas) all of the bad GI distress.  I was exhausted and really starting to unravel.  

This is how my week went up until last night (mostly because my husband helped/pushed me)

Day 1- tired, 😖 achy, slight cravings, massive chills, yawning and sneezing. Antidote: went to gym, swam six laps, Sauna, stationary bike on zero resistance....wearing a down coat.  Washed my hair.

Day two:  more irritable, sleep deprived, RLS, and all of the above symptoms.  Antidotes: Ate a pear, two bites of chicken, Lots of water, 1.5 hour deep tissue massage. Rest, (no sleep.)

Day three:  ALL  above symptoms getting worse. Still felt crappy.  Showered and tried to rest.  New symptom =Migraine 😫Took at least eight different supplements for sleep that night including 2 different CBD products, trazadone, a benzo, and clonidine, Advil and Aleve.   Did not care if I died during the night.  Slept 3 hours - tossing, light, useless sleep.  Antidotes tried during the day: 1/2 mile walk and 15 minutes in the sauna, lots of water and an orange.

Day 4: All of above, but sneezing is slowing down from 5-7 sneezes in a row to 3.  What progress!  In most of day in bed.  Everyone is so annoying!  Antidotes: Turned off phone.  kept hydrated, chicken noodle soup.  Went to a Christmas light display that was really impressive.  Tuned to a radio station thing and watched the lights change to the music. Cheered me up a little; it was Christmas Eve.

Day 5:  Christmas 🎄.  All of the symptoms described on all days plus wicked GI distress.  I was in bed all day. Hubby’s patience running low; I don’t  blame him.   We get TWO very distressing pieces of news.  Nobody is dead but it is bad.  I pick a huge fight with husband.  He’s sick of this, I want to die, I fight with the adult kids, AND THEN the insanity....I picked the tree and threw it across the room.  Broke a couple sentimental ornaments and the lights on the tree.  Antidotes: cry about wanting to die for an hour, take a benzo, go downstairs and pack up Christmas.  Throw away tree, pack up ornaments, take down garlands and mistletoe  and nativity.  Throw away wrapping paper, boxes and ribbons.  Totally Grinch the whole damn house. 

Day 6: Today at 4:00 (20 minutes) will be six whole days. I still feel very unwell but  I am noticing a lessening of the worst symptoms.  Antidotes: Apologize to husband, ride along to take the dog to the vet, stop by my favorite little family store and buy a $3 can of some kind of crazy health drink.   Today the sun is out and the sky is blue.  It has been gray and cold and 30 degrees every day of my quit until today.  I folded a load of laundry so I must be getting better.  It was exhausting.  Husband still dragging me to the gym again in an hour.  

Day 7:  who knows?

The days I haven’t exercised in the past week have been extremely painful, and the days that I have, have been much more tolerable, and even pleasurable at times.

Any thoughts on a second jump? I don’t even want to think about the “kindling effect”. I don’t care if it’s better or worse than last time but I don’t want to come into 2020 with this shit on my shoulders. Maybe I’m putting too much pressure on myself. My wife says so and she’s probably right. I always do that. 

A second quit comes with knowledge of how it goes but it also complicated things because you know those things from before. Waited until Christmas was over so I could be semi normal around family. 

My taper plan is a one day every now and again joke. I’m already under the weather & half sick. I already started my dose of the day albeit 1grm less than usual. I can make it all day on less and then I can’t sleep and try to make up for it so I can sleep. It’s ridiculous.  

I’m just ranting I guess. We’re allowed that here right? Lol 😂 Anyways thanks for listening. Maybe I’m just thinking that there is something different that I don’t know that might help me get through a CT jump, but I don’t think there is any magic bullet of knowledge that will put me over the top.

So I'm in full fledged Post Acute Withdrawal, I was an extremely high user of kratom for 3 years (90 g/day habit in the end), and my last dose was 21 days ago. I did do a medical detox so I was on sub/tram for 5 days after that (15 days ago, last tramadol), then slipped one day a week later with a few pain pills. So I only just got on Naltrexone 5 days ago after 7 days total opioid free.

Okay so that's my status, and I am going insane with post acute withdarwal stuff. Or is it PAWS? Is this still acutes lingering? I am experiencing extreme discomfort and restlessness all day long, some achiness but mostly I just want to crawl out of my skin. It's not as painful as the first week of acutes but it's more mentally painful to be so uncomfortable with no relief. I also have had extreme insomnia since Sunday- I got 3 hours of sleep Sunday night, I got zero hours of sleep the next night, the night after a family friend finally gave me some xanax to sleep so I slept for a full 8 hours I think (but even with the xanax I woke up wide awake in the night, had to take more)  which gave me a wicked groggy hangover for Christmas, then last night I slept maybe 3-4 hours, apparently even talking in my sleep which I never do.

I have been prescribed clonidine, .1 mg, which I take 2-3 times a day for anxiety, restlessness, sleep, and anything else, but it hasn't really helped me much. I also have a prescription of Serequel for sleep, which used to work like magic but suddenly stopped working for me completely a few months ago. Could there be a correlation of me having been on Subuxone the last time Serequel actually worked for me? Like maybe subs potentiated the sleep? That's the only difference I can think of. I also take Propranolol for anxiety and Lexapro daily. Again, I've been on Naltrexone for a few days now, thank god, because I'm at high relapse risk with how things have been. So I called to try to get an appointment with a psych nurse practitioner tomorrow, but doubt she will be able to fit me in that quickly. I'm going to try to get a refill on Gabapentin even if I can't see her, as I feel like there may be a correlation between my prescription having ran out and the insomnia starting.  So please, all, what should I ask from my psych person if I see her?? What is the best prescriptions for sleep that wouldn't be suspicious to ask for? I don't think she'll give me a prescriptpion for a benzo, which would solve a lot of issues, but I've only seen her once and she's an addiction specialist so she probably wouldn't give me that. Besides sleep medication, what helps you with that general discomfort/restlessness feeling?? Anything?  I should also mention I use many supplements - Valerian for sleep, then take GABA, Same-e, L-theanine-, 5-htp, omega-3, tumeric, and l-tyrosine. Also, I've had both types of insomnia - trouble falling asleep and trouble staying asleep.

Outside of RXs, what helped you most with the discomfort? Baths help but only momentarily while I'm in them. I also have been feeling really really weak on top of being uncomfortable, like flu-like weak, so it's hard to walk let alone get myself to the gym. I'm going to try really hard though if I muster up the energy, as I know that at least helps with my mood.

Thanks all. The only good side to all of this is that my mood hasn't plummetted to suicidal ideation this time around, so I'm happy about that. But I'm going to go insane if this lasts much longer, holy shit.",4

Took some comfort meds to hopefully lower it to about 10gpd in the next couple of days. But I have a question.

It was I was to potentiate the kratom, by drinking grapefruit, taking DXM or using any other method, would this be beneficial to my taper? 

My thoughts are if I take 5gpd but potentiate it to feel like 10gpd (just an example), I won’t experience any bad withdrawal, but I’ll be able to drop an extra 5 grams. What do you all think? Is this smart, or is this just my brain trying to come up with an excuse to get High.",1
2019-12-26 00:47:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/efrl1c/struggling_at_work/,Struggling at Work,"I stare at my computer screen and yawn relentlessly, its 1:00 AM and I still have a full shift ahead of me.  Even though I slept, I'm exhausted and uncomfortable, wishing I was at home in bed watching TV with no work concerns, but here I sit, trying to make it through the night and faking that I feel OK.

My biggest concern is that I am not proactive.  I'm a manager but I've been doing the absolute bare minimum of work to get by and that concerns me.  I begin to worry that someone will pick up on it and I will get called out or lose respect.  It's a million times harder to regain it than maintain it.  Yet, no one has seemed to say anything.  I've always been known to worry about things that dont exist.  No one has said anything to me, none have asked if I'm ok.

Sitting at my desk is almost painful.  I absolutely do not want to be there and I find no pleasure in it like I normally do.  Its largely due to anhedonia, exhaustion and general discomfort.  I just keep telling myself to grind it out until the weekend but I dread that almost too, because I know a whole new week follows after that.

The only thing I enjoy right now is lying in bed watching TV and that isn't even that great.  I do enjoy getting on the computer for a little while.  The best thing that makes me feel better is smoking weed.  It relaxes me and makes things actually enjoyable.  Now it makes me a little more tired the next day, so I've backed off it for the past few days.  I plan on smoking a little more on Friday.

Friday will make 14 days.  The first few days weren't horrible, but it seems the general fatigue and exhaustion is just taking its toll.  I sleep OK, but I will toss and turn a lot.  I will almost have fever dreams about things I dont even do or control.  Earlier tonight I was having dreams/nightmares about different kinds of vapes and I dont even smoke tobacco!

Please god... make this better.",16

When I found this thread I was so very scared and confused but so many of you have reached out and offered great advice and guidance. I am grateful.
Ok so quick history 30 GDP 2 years and no joke 80 dollars a day in extracts (yeah I know) no taper just jumped and it has been hell. Constant body tremors, stomach pain, chills, shits, cold sweats and of course no sleep at all for four days then I got an hour or two and was grateful then three hours and last night over seven hours of sleep!! 
I am having problems with my emotions but I now know that this shall pass in time which brings me to my point, if you found this thread and are terrified like I was thinking you will be stuck forever and it will be too hard to quit you are in for a surprise.
YOU CAN DO IT!!! There are so many good people with accurate advice based on experience here (I don't count myself as one yet) that if you ask your questions and really seriously consider the advice the pros give you and yes there are pros here that have unfortunately gone through this more than once, you will make it.
Sorry for rambling I just appreciate everyone so much. Thank you everyone so much I truly needed this place.

This is my 23th day of my cold turkey Kratom withdrawal. I finally slept 8 hours 1 day ago. Then I did big mistake: I drank some Yerba Mate. It was only 1 teaspoon but I slept baldy this night (I think) because of it. I seems to be very sensitive to caffeine still. How do feel the last days ? Still kinda blah...  When I drink my Kava Kava in the evening I feel much better though so for now I will keep drinking it. It makes me relaxed, I sleep and it gives me something to look forward to for now and is non addictive. Yes the morning rebound anxiety sucks but better I get some decent sleep! maybe I will drop the Kava Kava on the 30 day mark. The next 5 days I have to function because I will drive 3500km to Georgia so no experiments anymore. I noticed over the last days that I get hungry very often and I eat so much which is good because I got some  anorexia from Kratom and i lost too much wheight. I already look better. The dark circles start to vanish bit by bit. I do the wim hof breathing everyday today also cold showers which really helps me. I can feel the endorphins in my brain after the recovery breath which is great. Feel greatly better afterwards so I will definitely keep doing that!

I am still sneezing. I have still some anxiety and the harshness feeling is also still there. But it doesn’t matter because the worst is already over. Shure this blahhh not happy not not happy feeling sucks but hey here I am not drinking the green sludge which is totally worth it!!!!",11

This is a message for all fellow addicts, by which I mean, those of us who run to substances, situations, and semblances in order to escape our thoughts—almost always of ourselves. For we’re never good enough, smart enough, strong enough, wise, loving, caring, giving, sacrificing enough … WE, are never enough for ourselves. Always falling short. Never living up to our ideals. We’re never able to transform *the* world, *our* world. We can never fix all that we see that’s in need of fixing. We can never mend, cure, save, uplift.

As the years drift by, our pain becomes enormous, living with the multitudinous failures, dashed dreams, and unrealized hopes. Oh, but for the joy we meant to bring, the longing we meant to meet, the aches we meant to sooth, the hope we meant to reclaim. And on our worst days our lives seem to have left behind us a landscape reminiscent of a scorched-earth policy of retreat. Dear God, how do we live with that pain?

By racing back to the substance. Very few people could survive what we put ourselves through. Very few could live up to the secret ideals we hold for ourselves. Only fiction holds the characters that accomplish the aims we long to attain. Only saints and martyrs can carry the torturous emotions and feelings we carry around like they’re no more than pocket change.

We are tortured … by ourselves. Nearly endlessly. Our own thoughts and ideas, though noble in some respects, are our torture devices. Our minds keep speaking to us. We listen. We always have. We never knew there was a choice. How do you *not* listen, when silence is the only other option?

Choose silence. It is the language of God, as someone much more knowing than I said. Choose the voice that is not condemning you. Listen for the love being whispered in your ear endlessly—if silently (love is never noisy or brash, remember that from somewhere?) 

Those times when you are metaphorically screaming, could you hear the quiet voice? Could you make yourself listen? Impossible. Even in those “euphoric” moments you are quietly screaming; “stay here. don’t lose this. whatever the cost.”

Moments later you begin to shrivel and sadden as the euphoria recedes …

And the metaphorical screaming returns.

Quits and tapers and subs and supps. Anxiety and anhedonia and shakes and sweats. Begin to listen for the voice you can’t hear. It *want’s* to be sought. It *must* be. It is the only means by which it becomes a part of you, for it won’t invade you as everything else does. For unless you pursue it, it would be a rape. Imagine that? God (for instance) appearing before you on your favorite path in the forest? Would you ever be free to develop your own thoughts again? Could you ever be free to make your own discoveries of Him (ex.)?

But never mind. This is meant to say we’ve spent our lives listening, following a voice we thought was the most knowing, most caring of our best interests. It isn’t because that voice is as tortured and full of pain and fear as we are. It *is*, us. Begin, gently, lovingly (towards yourself … as best you can) searching out those voices (they are many) that you have heard and knew were of a different source than the voice you’ve always listened to. Perhaps a guru you heard, a YouTube video, a book, a meditation, an author. There are many voices, all with pieces of the love and fullness you long for. Search these and begin an assemblage of a great blessing for yourself. 

May a little piece of Christmas live in your heart each day this year, and may *you* be the most blessed for it. Blessings to all of you.",92

Tapering really helped this time with quitting- I feel like I need to mention that it was the only way due to being in clinicals and in my last year of grad school and that's why I made the jump at this time: no school, no work, 3 weeks to recover. 
Luckily the physical WDs arent as bad during this quit (just muscle pain, stomach cramps, lethargy) and not as shitty (for me) as opioids. The psychological WDs are a different story.

2019-12-24 23:15:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/efbu9h/grinding_it_out/,Grinding it Out,"A massive yawn comes out of my mouth, it has to be the 100th one of the day.  I'm talking to my manager about what's been happening in the office, its a decent conversation.  I'm terribly uncomfortable, tired and aching.  It's been about 11 days since I quit taking kratom yet again.  All I can think about is going home, putting on pajamas and relaxing, but I know that won't even be comfortable.

It was nearly 2 days ago that I last smoked or ate weed.  I had quit to see how it affected my feelings or energy levels.  Now that I am about 48 hours out I am seeing a little bit of a difference.  I don't know if that has to due with the timeline of withdrawal or quitting weed or both.  I slept a little better when I made it home and when I woke up I had a little more energy than I normally do which was nice.

I read through my posts going back almost 2 years.  I can instantly teleport back to the moments I wrote those posts.  I can see the places and remember exactly what was going on in those moments.  I realize that I have a tendency to quit taking kratom around holidays.  I'm not doing it intentionally but for some reason that tends to be the way it happens.

My current feeling is quite hard to describe.  Its an amalgamation of all my previous withdrawals combined.  It's not extreme, but somewhere right in the middle, enough to make you crazy.  I am tired, but not exhausted.  I am achey, but not in pain.  I am aware, but not alert.  I want food, but I'm not hungry.  I can't get comfortable, but I'm not restless.  It's sort of a nightmare.  I feel like something is about to happen at any moment, but it doesn't.

If you look at my post history it is fraught with nightmare stories.  This time it isn't even the worst.  The concern I have now is that I am SO slow to recover.  Usually, around this point, I am really starting to recover.  I am, but at just an extremely slow pace.

I will look at some of the positive.  I am seeing an extremely slight improvement.  Today, my sleep was a little bit better.  I didn't toss and turn as much and stayed in a deep sleep longer.  I felt a little more refreshed when I woke up and I had a little energy to tidy things up a bit.  My yawning, while still a lot, has toned down a little.  The restless feeling at work has subsided and now I am left with more a lingering extreme boredom feeling.

It's as if I have no interest in anything.  I just want to sit in front of the TV or computer and space out.  I don't want to think about much other than what's in front of me.  Lying in my bed and watching TV with nothing else to do is the most pleasant thing I can do right now.  Basically, I can just grind it out from there.

Before I forget, you may be wondering how I got here.  Check out my post history and you will see about half of my withdrawals over the past 2 years.  Some extremely minor and some pure terror.  This latest stint started in early October.  I moved to a new city (which I really stressed about in previous posts, some of my concerns came true but it wasn't like what I expected) and started a new job.  I absolutely love the new city.  I did some exploring when I was first here and I've done a lot of things, but the kratom has largely been my favorite thing to do.  I was having a blast moving to a new city, having an adventure and thought I would amplify it with kratom.  The kratom here has been way better than what I got back in my old city.

I started off with my normal dose.  I would take about 15 grams when I got home from work and then redose a few hours later with about 6-12 grams.  On weekends, I would pretty much have kratom coursing through my veins the entire weekend.  I would gradually up my dosage and move to taking between 20-40 grams in a sitting with no redose.  If I took too much I would get the spins and would feel like absolute shit.  I would have to fall asleep for an hour or two for it to wear off and even then I would still have this shitty feeling.  I started finding at really high single doses that the horrible feeling would last well over 10+ hours.  There were a few times I had to go to work and I could not focus on anything.  If I got pulled over the cops would surely think I was on something, even though I was completely fine and sober... the kratom was still fucking with my eyes.

Back to now.  The best improvements I've seen is that I feel like me again.  I don't feel hollow.  I feel like a real person with feelings.  It's like kratom reduces your feelings by 90% and when they come back online, its something else and its only been getting better.  Today, I started getting brief glimpses of feeling somewhat normal again.  They are very fleeting and lasts only a few seconds.  That's a good sign as I haven't felt that at all since I quit.  I am a little more confident as well, but still have a ways to go.  My skin is 50x better and my hair is making a come back.  My eyes look a million times better.  They are no longer red, hanging and glassy.

This is my wish.  I want to gain my energy back, my interest in things and return to somewhat normalcy.  I'd love to lose at least 30 lbs as well as I gained quite a bit of weight over the past year of abuse.  This weekend I would like to the discomfort to go away.  I'd love to smoke some weed and laugh my ass off while NOT feeling terribly tired.  Next week I'd love to have somewhat normalcy return with some tiredness lingering being OK.  Down the road I'd love to try a few new things instead of feeling like I am wasting my life.  I'd be OK with failing and trying new things, but not doing them at all is worse.

I just want to feel normal again.  What's sad is I've made it so many times, yet every time I feel like it's never going to get better.  One day you wake up, don't think about kratom, don't feel like you're in withdrawal and have a completely normal day.  Then you'll be in bed, going to sleep, when you realize ""oh.  I've been in kratom withdrawal and this is the first day I didn't feel like I was.""  I can't wait to reach that moment again.",8

Waste of money.

I was clean off off all substances for about 5 years at the time, very involved in recovery, worked with at risk kids, helped 100s of people get clean... but I was in pain... I knew if I were to go to a doctor, the pain pills would follow... I refused to go back to that life... after watching some documentaries on Kratom, everything made it sound like it was safe... like it was “mildly addictive” and withdraw was nothing... 

I decided to try it for my pain and it worked like a charm... now Kratom has an extremely bad stigma in the recovery community ( and now I know why ) so I kept it to myself... I was only taking about once a day, small does, when my back just couldn’t take it anymore... I had to start taking more and more because it stopped working... I wasn’t doing “ addict “ things.... I wasn’t hurting anyone, I was still responsible, it didn’t lead to to anything else....

Fast forward to now and im still taking it.. I wanted to stope after about 6 months cuz my back started to feel better and the withdrawal was insane... now it’s so bad that I have to wake up after about 5 hours of sleeping and dose because I’m i go into withdrawal while sleeping. At this point I probably take 5-8 grams 5-6 times a day... I feel like I’m always in withdrawal... instead of restless legs I always feel like I have restless arms... it’s really weird...

I just want to stop and I don’t know how... I still haven’t went back to my “addict” ways... that’s the weird thing... I’m just physically addicted... it’s been almost 8 years off of narcotics, alcohol, and any other drug... just this damn powder that I was told a million times it’s not a drug, it’s safe, it’s not addictive... I have no idea what to do... I can’t afford to take 2-3 weeks off and shake in my bed.... I’ve even thought about going to a doctor and get like 2 weeks of suboxone to do a taper because the Kratom taper is way to long... I guess either way I need to do something... it just sucks when you worked so hard to change, helped so many people, and really took something with the intent of feeling better not getting high and I’m back to this point...

After it’s all done, you can look back and say “I got through this without kratom”. 

Because it’s okay to not be cheerful all the time. It’s okay to be low energy and lazy sometimes. It’s okay to not be in the “party” spirit and want to socialize so much. 

Set the new standard. You don’t have to always be perfect. 

Happy holidays and love for you all.",50

I hopped off at about 15-20 grams per day. However, I did oxy for about 5 days after. Like 30 mg per day. Now I am two days completely clean. My question is about cross dependency. My body was dependent on kratom not oxy. Did using the oxy prolong the kratom withdrawals? I don’t think my body became very dependent on the oxy after just 5 days of low doses. Did my body recognize the oxy on my receptors and therefore prolong the healing from the kratom use? I’m still sick and it’s 8:30 AM and I still haven’t been able to sleep. I apologize. Merry Christmas!

Edit: Also, I have taken 8mg of loperamide twice in the past 12 hours. It’s made me feel so much better. Does this also prolong the withdrawal?",1

I ended up using it daily and increased my doses dramatically because I never used a scale and just eyeballed it. I always saw kratom as a mild booster and it always seemed very innocent. For a while I was thinking about quitting but told myself I don’t need to because I don’t really have a reason to. Slowly but surely I found my reasons. 

I don’t know what it is about kratom but it lures you into this vicious cycle of habit. Besides the obvious (kratom addiction) it makes you addicted to doing the same things over and over. For me I did the same thing day in and day out and barely hung out with friends because I liked being home whenever I took my daily doses. I am so lucky I caught on to this because I wasted an entire year pretty much doing nothing because of this stuff. Every day I was home watching videos on YouTube eating the same stuff. 

So besides the toxic habit addiction, kratom exacerbated my ADHD. I always had a short attention span because of my ADHD but this shit took it to another level. I was constantly doing clumsy shit like burning pots because I forgot it was on, and forgetting simple shit like my wallet. Every. Single. Day. It kind of made me go on mental tangents but 24/7. My mind was kind of always in the air and I couldn’t accomplish shit. It’s kind of like when you have music blasting on your headphones and can’t think straight no matter how hard you try.

The last side effect I wanted to talk about was the effect it had on my diet. I don’t know what that green shit does to your microbiome but I was addicted to eating the same foods day after day. I’d buy two boxes of fruit snacks every day to eat while I watch bullshit. I ended up catching on to this too but it wasn’t until I stopped that I confirmed kratom was the culprit because I was grossed out by every single one of those foods after quitting. 

I ended up relapsing because I thought something was wrong with me when I didn’t find much enjoyment in doing things a month after quitting (I didn’t know about the lingering PAWS. But now I take kratom much less now and I don’t think about it at all. Whereas before, my next dose was always on my mind.  I used to take 8 grams twice a day and now I take 1.1 gram every two days which is threshold dose and I’m still going down. I want to continue this long ass taper until I can’t feel the threshold effects. 

So now that I’m not nowhere nearly as deep into addiction as I was before, kratom is serving its original purpose which was just a very mild boost. That green stuff is very very sneaky and your addiction takes as long to fade out as it took to fade in. 

Please let me know if you can relate to any of what I mentioned above. 

TLDR: kratom sucked me into a vicious habit of doing nothing and procrastinating as well as alter my gut flora so that I crave the same foods everyday. It also amplified my adhd and made me feel out of it 24/7.",9

I’ve been using it for about a week 2-3 tea spoons per day and then one teaspoon of kratom at the end of the night. If I keep doing it this way for another week or so I should be able to jump off kratom without withdrawals right? Or should I chop it down to like a half teaspoon per night for this next week and then quit,2
2019-12-23 22:09:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/eev7ya/when_will_it_get_better/,When Will It Get Better?,"For 2 years I have used kratom off and on.  It's been vicious, but basically I will abuse it, using 25-65 gpd, for weeks or months on end.  My longest stint had to be 3-4 months.  I will then quit and withdraw for a few weeks or almost 2 months.  I have never gone more than 2 months.  Each withdrawal has been unique and the length has also been different.  It all varies on the quality and type of kratom, length of use and how I feel physically.

I quit cold turkey about 10 days ago.  It wasn't too bad initially, but seemed to get worse as time went on.  It seemed like my body thought it was a small break, but when it realized it was no more it flipped out a little.

I had been taking one massive hefty dose daily and on weekend taking more.  I would take about 20-25 grams in the evening and relax.  On weekends I'd do it through the night, probably using another 20-30 more.  I did this for 2 months after taking a break for about 30 days.  I was out of withdrawals at that moment.

Now, I can't seem to shake it.  I am healing seems to be very slow.  I've had RLS pretty bad this time around.  I find it hard to sit still at work because it's like jolts of energy running down my lower back and left leg want to move them or they hurt.  Its definitely RLS.  Its improved because the first week was a nightmare and this week it has been OK.

I've been pretty tired most of the time.  I have been smoking weed.  It's mostly been dabs, vape pens and edibles (it's legal here) and they make a world of difference.  If I'm feeling tired it can turn it around or if im totally bored it can make me have some interest in something.

I did get to see one of my favorite artists last week but was not nearly as excited as I should have been because I was burnt out.  I still enjoyed myself but not like I normally would...

So basically... I have no energy to do anything, not even work out or clean which I would like to do both.  My appetite sucks... I rarely get hungry and basically have to force feed myself.  The same goes for water.  I have to force myself to drink.  Oh I almost forgot... depression and anxiety.

The depression started picking up last night.  I had no interest in work and began questioning my life.  I even began to joke with myself about being homeless or living with my parents again.  It was like the pain and agony of having to sit through work was unbearable because it was so terribly boring.  However, I realize that pretty much any kind of work would be this way right now.  I've been doing the bare minimum to make it.  No one has said anything to me, I just hope everything kicks back on soon and I can start to say I feel better, which right now I dont.

The anxiety has been a problem, but not as much as usual.  I definitely feel tense.  I sometimes think I'm going to get caught or someone will realize I'm not working as hard or that I'm being a little lazy.  It's been the opposite and people have even complimented my hard work.  Just today my boss thanked me for everything I've been doing.  Clearly, I'm worrying about something that I shouldn't.

The hardest part has been the uncomfortableness and lack of energy.  When I get home from work I change clothes and get comfortable.  I sit down at the computer or TV and just begin to yawn uncontrollably.  If I go to bed it can sometimes be hard to sleep, but I did eventually fall asleep.  However, the sleep royally sucks.  I basically wake up every hour and then roll over in an effort to get comfortable.  I will try and go back to sleep but sometimes it takes a while.  My dreams will be all over the place.  They've improved since I first started, but can still be a little scary sometimes.

I'm ready to fast forward to the restlessness in my legs going away.  I'm ready for my energy to return.  I'm ready to stop yawning every 10 minutes.  I'm ready for my appetite to pick back up.  I'm ready to feel normal again, not like there is some cold or sickness just lingering with me.

When will it finally stop?!?!  If I had to guess... by this weekend I will feel a  whole lot better.  Then by the weekend after that I will be drastically better.  I suspect by day 30 I will be almost back to normal.  I can wait it out, just having to go to work and live a normal life sucks during this time.  I wish I could just stay in bed, watch movies, play games and go on walks until I recover.  But maybe working is helping speed things up too.  

I'm just ready to feel better again.",10

Over the past couple weeks I managed to lower it to about 20-25gpd.

Now I decided to immensely reduce my intake but replace it with temporarily taking comfort meds and some supplements. So far the biggest issue for quitting has been the intense anxiety I get. What I’ve been doing is the following:

First day:

2.5g of phenibut 7:00am

2g kratom 7:00am

4g kratom 8:am

2g kratom 12:am

2g kratom 4:00pm

2g kratom 8:00pm

4g kratom 12:00am


Second day:

2g kratom 11:30am

1mg of etizolam 1:30pm

1 mg etizolam 4:30 pm

2g kratom 6:00pm 

1 mg etizolam 8:00 pm

1 mg of etizolam 12:00 am

2g kratom 12:30 am

Third day:

2 g kratom 11:30am

0.5 mg etizolam 1:00pm

0.5 mg etizolam 4:00pm

0.5 mg etizolam 11:00pm

4 g kratom 12:30 pm

Fourth day: (today)

2 g kratom 10:00am

0.5 mg etizolam 12:30pm

0.5 mg etizolam 4:00pm

0.5 mg etizolam 7:30 pm

0.5 mg etizolam 11:00 pm

4 g kratom 12:30 am

I don’t know if this is smart to be honest, I don’t necessarily enjoy the benzo they make me really tired but my anxiety and RLS are gone. I’m hoping that once I run out; I can drastically reduce my kratom dose to like 10gpd or 15gpd and coast there for a while until I can lower it some more. Should I do that or show I just all out quit after being at 6 grams for the last two days?",1
2019-12-23 16:01:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/eeqijs/almost_4_weeks_suboxone_free_taking_kratom/,"Almost 4 weeks suboxone free, taking kratom. Looking for experiences like mine.","Okay I’ll make this as short as I can. I was on methadone for 7 years, had a HELL of a time tapering below 20mg as depression would succumb me. I made the switch to suboxone in the summer, June or July. 19mg of methadone was replaced with 3mg suboxone. Slowly tapered from there and finally dropped off at the end of November.

I’ve been off of hard drugs for exactly 4.5 years, now I almost feel right back in active addiction, I’ve just switched the suboxone for kratom and because I compulsively took more and more I’m at a 11g 4-5x a day habit for the last couple weeks. Y’all warned me about this and I should’ve listened. I’m *now* (as of yesterday) actually weighing out my doses and 11g is definitely quite a decrease from what I’ve been taking.

I want to taper myself off slowly and finally be done with this shit but it’s so hard because I have no energy and a cupboard full of kratom. The Addict in me is hard to keep disciplined. To me, going back on suboxone due to kratom is ridiculous, especially coming from a few year IV heroin user like I once was. 

Are the kratom withdrawals comparable to what I went through with the suboxone or no? Should I cold turkey it and be done or try to control myself through a taper? 

Anyone else been in my position? Please tell me your stories, good and bad. 

I was really craving hard drugs and was in a very vulnerable spot coming off suboxone and that’s why I started using the kratom instead. So dumb. Thanks!",2

I know this dosage and time is not as serious as a lot of others on here, so I didn't expect withdrawals to have a serious effect like this. After the physical symptoms started to end I noticed intense waves of the deepest depression I've ever had.

Two days ago I was on my way to buy kratom because I wanted to be positive around my family at Christmas time, but I missed a turn on the way there and then snapped out of it and ended up driving home. Today I went again to buy and the store, for the first time ever, was completely out. Not sure if it's divine intervention but I feel like everything is trying to keep me sober and I just keep trying to find away around it.

I find myself being unable to think about anything but the most negative aspects of my life, of which there's very few, and anything that would usually make me comfortable is completely ineffective. Im lingering on a recent relationship that ended months ago, more than I was before quitting. I keep trying to tell myself it's temporary but i had occasional depression episodes before kratom, and a part of me keeps saying I'll never be truly happy again like I was before chugging this sludge every day.

I know this is a common symptom and im sure it will not last too much longer, but any testimonials that others have about the duration of the depression and anxiety would be greatly appreciated. I still can't believe I let myself use this for so long without considering the ways it was impacting my relationships and mental stability. I just want to be me again.

Thanks, happy holidays!",14

Heres my Story :

I started using kratom about 6 months ago in the summer where i was heavily depressed and anxious (I have always had anxiety/panic attacks but the depression has gotten worse since a couple of years)
At first kratom was a lifesaver, it made me go out again enjoy things get rid of my anxiety etc. Eventually i would start using it daily for my mental issues , I do have ADHD aswell.
In these 6 Months I pretty much never really increased my dose I take 7.5 Grams everyday.

I decided that i want to quit the drug since I dont feel any of the beneficial effects anymore and because I really dont wanna increase my dosage.


I am kind of afraid of the withdrawal since i already withdrew once (cold turkey) for about a week it was pretty bad i had zero motovation couldnt sleep was sweating had terrible anxiety depression etc.
After that week i said to myself this aint worth it i am going back on kratom which was stupid I know.

I wanted to ask you guys a couple of things

1. Should I try the tapering method and if so how much should I taper each day?

2. Do you recommend any types of nootropics or supplements that can make the withdrawal easier?

3. How long of a withdrawal can I expect or how long do you think the PAWS will be (I am hoping not too long since i have only been on it for 6 months)

This will be the first sober Christmas in 8 years. We bought a apartment on the coast of the Black Sea in the booming subtropical  city Batumi. Perfect time to start all over again. That was the best time to quit K for good. 

How do I feel ? Kinda blah. I can’t say I feel bad but I don’t feel good most of the time either. Do you know this feeling when you between the worlds ? Not really there but also not gone ? The first few days my emotions came back full force now they seem to be gone again. Yes I can laugh a little sometimes but I can’t feel an emotional connection to my wife yet or my best friend. Hope my emotions will come back soon. I still can’t sleep without the help of Supps like Kava Kava or CBD. I don’t have any CBD for tonight so Wim Hof Breathing and Kava Kava must be enough. I am so looking forward to get normal sleep again. I think my dissociation is from this massive lack of good sleep for now 20 days which is actually really crazy if you think about it. Now wonder the recovery time is so long. The Braintuner helps to feel balanced during the day and I am NOT depressive my any means but doesn’t help with sleep right now. My morning anxiety is there again but that’s just rebound anxiety from Kava Kava. I need it for now to get sleep.  Anyway... I am happy that I managed to get to day 20 and I am looking forward what the fourth week will bring. Hope something will change on the day 30 / 1 month mark! 

When did you sleep normal again and how much and how long did you take K ? 

I am szeezing the whole day I think my body fights a cold right now. Doesn’t matter. This too shall pass. My mantra through all of this shit. The good thing is that I am not that weak anymore, strength is coming back. My body temperature normalized and I have no RLS or very very minor if I don’t drink Kava Kava. The only thing left is a little “harshness” feeling through out the day and the insomnia. Hope this will get better soon. 

So all in all making good progress and I will report back regularly! :-) It’s 00:22AM and hoping to get some sleep soon after some shells of strong sedating Kava Kava!

I quit that CT and only had like 4 days of physical withdrawals

Considering all of that, what more can I expect? Am I in the calm before the storm or are most of the bad physical symptoms over?",1

I had 100 days clean (after 2-3 oz per day habit), relapsed for 4 months, climbed back to over an ounce per day.   Of course I went through WDs during my quit.

That ""quit"" lasted 16 days.  I got through the acutes, and was on my way.

Then I relapsed for just 10 days.  Climbed to nearly an ounce a day.

I am in day 5 of my quit after the 10 days on, and the acute Withdrawl ran the gamut. I am pretty much through the worst of it, but it was apparent that the 10 days ""on"" washed away any progress from the 16 days off.  

Bottom line, kratom is sneaky,  weasily, green little monster sludge bitch.   

Good luck everyone!  Hope this helps someone.",10

I'm terrified. I'm scared to taper, scared to go CT, scared of being addicted. I'm also afraid of what this is doing to my body. If I tell my husband, I'm afraid he'll divorce me - seriously. How many days of hell do I have to go through if I go cold turkey? Tapering seems like a long process and I don't know how long I can take being on this stuff. Somebody please help. Do I need to detox in a hospital? Do they even know what a kratom addiction is? I need some knowledge about this addiction - something to bring me off the ledge. 
Some background - I'm up to about 38 capsules a day. Been on kratom for about 2 years. But only recently realized I NEEDED the kratom. It went from recreational use to addiction in about 2 months. At least that's how I feel. I wasn't getting WD until then. OMG, I hate myself for doing this. I also suffer from anxiety & depression and am on medication for that. And I have high blood pressure, so I'm scared about that too.",2

1) as mentioned by the prior poster regular bowel movements are awesome
2) before my two year habbit I worked out atleast 5 days a week, sometimes every day. As my habbit continued my gym time died off until eventually I stayed out of the gym for over a year. I dont think it's any coincidence that I have been to the gym 4 times in the last week. It sucks starting over but it's nice to feel productive and experience a different type of endorphins.
3)Mindfullness. It's not all the time but I find myself able to be in the moment alot easier. Practicing mindfulness helps as well. Theres a bunch of good books out there my favorite is Cory Allen's book ""now is the way"" easy read with lots of good info.
4.) The only negative I still see is a little restless leg and just difficulty getting comfortable from time to time. Still my sleep is getting alot better. 
All in all I'm so glad I stopped. I had to cold Turkey which was super hard (it's super hard for everyone, I just couldnt taper or ide never stop) but after a few days I was super relieved to be off finally.

I got off heroin with Kratom five years ago and completely justified my addictive behaviors with Kratom for years. My dose is so insane at this point I don’t measure it Out but I’m guessing it to be close to 60 grams. I just recently went through quitting phenibut which was hell and it’s been a month and my mental health went to the shitter. And guess what.. Kratom stopped working. I feel like I’m in withdrawal every 3 hrs if I don’t dose. I started using more extract shots after I quit phenibut and that had made this whole situation worse. I smoke weed and drink occasionally but Kratom has been the biggest problem. Along with phenibut which I don’t use anymore. I made the decision that I have been unwilling to make for a long time that I’m going into treatment. I’m going into a 3 month program because last time I tried to go to rehab to get off Kratom and other things, I only went for a month and was still struggling  And went right back to Kratom. This is the last thing I want to do and I am so terrified of the withdrawals without having any meds to help. I also have been on gabapentin for years so I can expect a double whammy of withdrawals. I just want to live a substance free life. I never believe it’s possible for me though and my mental health has gotten so bad that I see no way out of this mess. I don’t know what I’m in for as I have increased the dosage by quite a bit since the last time I quit. I tapered off Kratom and it wasn’t bad but this was years ago. I definitely don’t have the self control to do a taper now so rehab is the only option. Rehabs don’t allow you to just come in for Kratom, the insurance doesn’t cover it. So I’m lying and saying I’m assisted to Xanax and Kratom and taking some Xanax the day I go in. This shit has ruled my life for five years. I’m so done with it. I said it before when I tried to quit and I really meant it but I failed and I think that being away for 3 months instead of 1 will be beneficial because hopefully I’ll be in a better spot when I get out and better able to handle life without Kratom. Just looking for some support. Any success stories of getting off long term high dose Kratom would help me too. I just want to know it’s possible. I never believed that Kratom would have a hold on me as much as heroin  does, but it definitely does. No I won’t die from an over dose and I’m still able to pay my bills but I’m miserable. I’m just so done with this. As soon as a bed opens up I’m leaving, so that could be tomorrow or a week from now. I’m scared but I need to do this. Thanks for listening to my rambling.",12

Stomach issues going away (almost none). Anxiety is basically non existent. I am, however, faced with a lack of motivation and excitement. This is what caused my relapse in the past. Yet, these feelings of apathy aren't consistent and I am trying to do more to keep myself busy.

Kinda unfortunately started smoking weed again (legal state). Definitely way too much. Need to slow down with that and I am really hoping not to get another rebound withdrawal.

Weird thing is i havent touched Kratom in 2 years, ran into a heavy Poppy Pod Tea addiction and clean from that since August.

It’s a complete list of 15 things to do that will allow you to achieve/manifest what it is you desire most in life to really live a wholesome life. 

Manifesting a happier life achieves so many great things. Live life. Attract what it is you most desire in life. Drop this shit. Rid of it and let go. Start manifesting greater things in your life. 

One of the things that is mentioned in this article is “cleaning up the clutter”- which means, simply letting go of things that are no longer serving you in your BEST life. Letting go of everything that no longer serves you, that is holding you back, and that is NOT making you feel you absolute BEST. (Kratom sure has hell makes us feel like we aren’t our best selves after a complete cycle of a nasty addiction.)

Let’s be in this together. Let’s inspire ourselves to be the very tool that pulls the plug so that we may live a life that serves US the best. One that is k-free. Manifest a life that serves you, and not this green poison.

2019-12-20 22:22:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/edkjbr/day_2_not_as_bad_as_i_thought/,Day 2 - not as bad as I thought,"Last night I fell asleep decently. I woke up at 4 am, tried to fall asleep again and maybe got another hour until I woke up at 7. I was expecting it to feel a lot of pain, depression and anxiety but I didn’t. It felt like a minor flu - body aches, and pressure in my eyes. 
 
I got out of bed and went to the bathroom. Diarrhea! I’ve had it all day and have spent a good part of the day on the toilet. On the toilet I open up Reddit and read a post on this sub about a guy who had spasms but laughed about it and had a positive outlook. I decided that I shall do that too. 

So instead of just lying in bed all day waiting for the withdrawals to stop, I’d go out on a bike ride. I rode for 20 miles. It was hard - I had muscle cramps, and an overall feeling of discomfort for most of the ride, but I pushed through. And I’m glad I did. I felt soooo much better afterwards. 

I made myself a nice lunch and then took a two hour nap. I woke up and made myself a coffee and watched the sunset. Still not feeling normal but trying to fight getting depressed and anxious. 

I’m trying to stay strong. I keep thinking about my vacation I’ll be able to take in January. Kratom has robbed me of traveling. I used to travel all the time and it’s my favorite thing to do. I’ll be looking at places to go soon and book a flight! I can’t wait! It’s a light at the end of the tunnel and it’s helping me be strong. 

I’m not scared of the withdrawals anymore and I hope tomorrow will be easier. Soon I’ll be feeling normal again! 

TLDR: rode my bike and that helped a lot. Had diarrhea all day, body pain, and an uneasy feeling. I’ll be booking a trip next month somewhere as a reward (something I couldn’t do in Kratom).",8
2019-12-20 19:45:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/edis6q/feels_like_im_on_the_other_side_of_something/,Feels Like I'm on the Other Side of Something,"Hi friends,
Well, tomorrow it will be 12 weeks without Kratom. My last post was three weeks ago, and it was about feeling the temptation to use again. That temptation was so strong at that time. Not physically, but mentally. Just a relief from everything. I wish I had better insight into how or why I didn't cave. Cause I was very close. 

At one point I was absolutely ready to go and buy and use. But I realized something: it was Thanksgiving day and no shops would be open. So, I went and did what was once my near-daily ritual for Kratom purchasing. I don't really know what I was thinking would happen, but I went through all the motions. I took the walk and then just stood in front of my shop, which was closed, and just stood there unable to buy. I don't know. I guess I was hoping to just introduce the muscle memory of *not* buying Kratom into my system or something. 

Anyway, that weird moment didn't entirely eliminate the mental desire to use, but as always, I took it one minute at a time and within a week, I really felt that mental temptation dissipate. Three weeks later, I don't *really* feel the mental temptation anymore. I kind of have some light ideation, like ""how nice would it feel for a Kratom buzz right now..."" but it's really not strong, and it's not compelling. 

Today may have been the most boring day of my life since I stopped using. For the last 8 hours I've basically just been sitting in my house doing nothing (a mix of factors, but I really had to be here and really couldn't do much while here). In the Kratom days, knowing I had a day like this ahead of me, I absolutely would have put some powder and extract in my system to get through it. And if I'd had to go through a day like this six weeks ago, I probably would have been losing my mind. But now, just shy of 12 weeks clean, the day just kind of... was. I was bored, sure, but that felt okay to me. I still had stress and soreness and was tired (cause I went to bed late from seeing Star Wars last night) but I just felt like ""oh, well. That's the way it goes."" Rather than thinking ""Kratom could make all that go away."" 

Oh! Speaking of sleep! Despite the aforementioned lack of sleep from a late night, I sleep pretty dang well now! Like most nights, if I put myself in bed 8 hours before I have to wake up, I will sleep for 7-8 hours. Looking back, it really *was* like improving throughout my quit. But it was like 5-10 minutes at a time, which, when you're starting with 1-2 hours, is nothing but 3 months later, that's 8 hours... 

Every other quit I've had I've always said ""I just need to quit being addicted to Kratom so I can use it responsibly again."" This time around it was just ""I need to quit being addicted to Kratom."" For a while I definitely thought ""*can* I use responsibly again?"" but I put off answering that question in any way for as long as I could. Now, I'm really starting to lose interest in answering it. It's not worth risking what I've built here in my sobriety. As is the wisdom, I accept that relapse may be a part of my recovery one day and I pray that if this does end up being the case, it is never more than an isolated incident, but for now I'm lucky enough to be in a place where I'm not fighting a battle of temptation.

I share all this in hopes that you that are in those days before me in the journey will see someone on the other side of something. All of us have different journeys but we are all on a journey and while we may hit milestones at different times, we can share in the knowledge and comfort that if we keep moving, we *will* hit them. Love to you all. Keep it up.",8

Things seem to be getting better. I’ve dodged most of the insomnia by using melatonin and valerian root at about 9:30. I’m also noticing that my writing seems to be worse. I assume it’s just a product of withdrawal or a placebo from delusions.

So the past few weeks have been full of a lot of ups and downs, but mostly ups.  I feel pretty damn phenomenal physically, but I attribute that to my workouts, steam room, hot tub baths, and sauna.  I've been drinking tons of water, eating healthy, and getting amazing sleep. Quite frankly my body feels cleansed and pure again.  It's pretty damn delightful.

I wanted to show you all the proof of what I've been able to achieve since I quit kratom.  A friend of mine made a slightly evil comment when I qualified for Boston about not being able to run that fast without kratom or something to that effect. Anyhow, it motivated me more than anything ever has to prove her wrong so I set my goals a lot higher for my next marathon.  Below is the tempo run I did on the treadmill today KRATOM FREE.  I didn't know if I could keep up these paces without it, but I did it and the joy it's given me is surreal.  I am finally FREE from all drugs and alcohol and I LOVE that I can feel all of it losing it's grip on me a little more each and everyday!  If you are quit now or in the process, just hold steady.  One day your neural pathways will heal and you will forget what it even used to feel like being on this drug!  Much love.

I can't believe it. I'm off this stuff :D I don't have any cravings, my digestition is almost back to normal, i have no physical issues at all. My morning anxiety is gone. Didnt had major depression at all (just a little sometimes) I don't drink kava kava anymore. Yesterday the only thing i took was some CBD + passionflower right before bed. My nervous system finallys settled down and the tiredness came which is a good sign because the peak of noradrenaline is gone. Now my body and brain can heal completly. The last 2 days i was a little bit angry inside for no reason sometimes, but this too shall pass. Its because of the lack of sleep / bad sleep quality i think. I'm not depressed at all. Just feeling normal, relaxed, ready to do the things i have to do. Let's see what the day and the next days brings!! Using the brain tuner right now with 2x20min of setting 3 (7.83 hz modulation of the 1000hz and 111.11 hz) as it seems to be the best for daytime and evening! To all of you that are still struggling to the worst part: Just PUSH THROUGH! The days will be soon only a distant memory times goes by so fast. I cant believe i am already on day 18. A month ago i was so nervous that i have to stop CT but now i almost done with it! YOU CAN DO IT!!!

Got anxiety later this day... Wim Hof breathing method... GONE!",4

I have family obligations but no work the next 2 weeks, I really can’t afford for my family to know, but I’m done with this bullshit.  Even at 7-12 gpd I get withdrawal between doses, horrible brain fog/forgetfulness that I think people at work are starting to notice, anxiety, and I can’t sleep past 5 am for the life of me unless I dose when I wake up.  I am a wimp, if I can get through this without total misery I think I can be successful.   Also supplementing with vitamin c, tyrosine, magnesium.
  
I have a script of temazepam my doctor gave me several months ago for anxiety, wondering if it will help.  I wake up early morning with what feels like restless legs in my legs and back, mental and physical anxiety, and feeling generally crappy.  
  
I am also a recovering alcoholic and I worry about kindling.  I’ve been ok taking temazepam once a week in the past, no desire to abuse it, it just makes sleep possible when I’m so anxious I’m contemplating a trip to the emergency room.  But I’m worried about kindling or dependence if I take it 3-5 nights in a row to get through the worst of the acutes.  
  
Any advice or experience is welcome.  Been lurking for a long time and you guys are such a great community, really appreciate reading about everyone’s experiences.",6

So I managed to quit kratom a month or so ago. I tapered down from a 1/2 kilo a week/week and a half habit down to basically nada. It wasn’t without withdrawals, although I ran out for 3 days initially so that sparked everything I guess. And those 3 days were bloody hell. 

But I digress. It’s been a month off the shit and I still have periods of *mild* restlessness. Slight RLS upon waking but nothing unbearable at all. I only notice it then. It’s nothing like it was during the withdrawal period. 

My head feels clear now. Kratom made me feel dull, lifeless, flat, numb, anhedonia, depressed, etc. I had a lot of issues with dissociation while on kratom. That’s subsided. I’m not as irritable as I was on kratom. 

My appetite has improved a lot. I lost a lot of weight on kratom. I manage to eat at least 2 light meals a day now. 

My bowel movements still are horrible. I think kratom fucked up my GI tract. I was using it for 2.5 years, daily. I never have solid bowel movements. Loose stool every morning. I wonder if the green sludge gave me IBS or something. I pooped better on kratom! I was never constipated because I drank tons of water. So idk what this shit did to my body but this is probably the most irritating thing I’m dealing with right now. 

As far as the mental stuff, my anxiety has overall improved, as well as my depression. I think kratom fucked me up mentally for awhile. I decided to go back on Wellbutrin and it’s the best choice I’ve made. Quitting kratom and taking back the control over my mental health has been so rewarding. 

Today I was at work, and I finally smiled for the first time...and kept smiling throughout the day. I felt emotion. I felt joy. Happiness. Love towards the kids I work with. Connection. The littlest of things brought me so much glee. Never in the time I took kratom did I ever feel genuine emotion this way. It was always under the artificial warm cloud of the herb. 

I’m so glad I managed to quit. I never thought I’d be able to with how much and how frequently I was dosing. I started kratom for anxiety and depression. It only made it worse. But now I’m free from the shit and you can be too. 

If you’re struggling to quit, or having a hard time with a taper, going through WD, etc...fucking keep going. After it’s all done with, there is light at the end of the tunnel. Breaking the chains from this shit is life changing. You’ll eventually feel like you again. You’ll save so much money. You’ll feel better emotionally, mentally and physically. You won’t need to dose first thing in the morning, throughout the day or in the middle of the night just to feel “normal”.

I NEVER thought I could get through it. I just took a leap of faith and decided to taper. I was so nervous once my last bag ran out. But once I realized I was living ok without kratom, a whole load of anxiety was lifted. Tapering really helped me, but you have to be dedicated to your taper plan. 

Anyway I’m just getting this all off my chest. I feel so proud of myself for kicking this habit and going through to the other side. I’m grateful for this forum as well. It helped me when I was really struggling. I never thought I’d be on here telling a success story but here I am. If I fucking did it, so can you, believe me.",32
2019-12-19 22:01:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/ed41jx/day_1_quitting/,Day 1 quitting,"38/m here, have been using Kratom for two years. I used about 2 teaspoons every morning (sometimes 3), and sometimes would take the same dose in the afternoon and/or evening. It has been 36 hours since my last dose and I'm feeling fine. Not great, but noting compared to opiate withdrawal and so far it seems manageable. 

I decided to quit Kratom because my once thick, curly hair started thinning to the point where you can see my scalp quite easily. I also miss being able to hop on a plane whenever I want without worrying about what I'll do w/out Kratom. 

I've read about hair thinning using Kratom a while back, but I ignored it. After my hair started thinning, I didn't think much about it, and started using minoxidil and ketoconazole shampoo. It's been about 6 months using them but my hair is now visibly thinner. Before getting on finasteride which I already ordered, I figured let me try quitting Kratom first. 

Today I've felt a bit lethargic, very horny (I came about 5 times),  a bit of restless leg syndrome, and a bit depressed. I had gabapentin laying around that I was prescribed last year and took a pill, and it seems to be helping my mood and restless leg syndrome. Today was not nearly as bad as I though. 

I'll be writing an update in the comments every day to document my experience. I was considering tapering if it got too hard, but so far it feels manageable, although that may change. As a reward to myself, I'm planning on taking a trip to a tropical beach somewhere next month.",6

I’ve been a Kratom user for about 2.5-3 years, doing at least 4-5 big heaping spoonfuls daily. I’ve been so addicted that I just stopped measuring it out in order to get it in my system as fast as possible. My job is very stressful, and takes a huge emotional toll on me. I turned to kratty to ease some of that social discomfort (hospice funeral director.) 

I decided 3 days ago that I’d quit Kratom and get on the road to a healthy lifestyle again. In my total Kratom career, I’d say I’ve only gone about 1-2 days MAX without using the stuff. I used to joke around and say I’m going through “kratty withdrawals” when I went more than a day without it, thinking it wasn’t at all possible to withdraw from an herb; however, I soon found out that withdrawal symptoms from Kratom are real.....AND THEY SUCK. I’m fucking dying over here guys, I need help. How many more days of this do I have to endure until it to stops? Or at least eases up a little. I’m desperate. Any advice helps!

It’s probably just gonna take a lil longer before I feel like me completely. I never thought I’d make it to a month back when I was first starting to quit.

My sleep was messed up even when i took kratom ( not before thoug) so i think in my case this issue will linger for much longer.

2019-12-19 00:16:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/ecomss/7_months_later_an_addicts_redemption/,7 months later: An Addict's Redemption,"Seven months ago to the day I made what is simultaneously the best and the most difficult decision of my life: to stop kratom (as well as all drugs including alcohol). I had been existing for a long time, existing being the key word for I was not living. My days consisted staying at home, consuming kratom, being swallowed up by mundane distractions (Netflix, youtube), and watching life go by. The whole world outside of my small room was happily moving on by but I was stuck between those four walls, all alone, and stuck....stuck in a kratom induced and self imposed prison.

Seven months ago I consumed the last dose of the vile leaf and turned my will and recovery over to something greater than myself, to the people in the rooms of NA and to my personal understanding of my higher power. I took their suggestions, it was the first time in my life I actually truly listened to anyone. I guess when things are bad enough, we are all willing to listen to anything that might offer even the slightest hope of salvation, of redemption. I made 90 meetings in 90 days and I started to work the steps. Everyone told me things would get better and despite my pessimism, something truly amazing happened: it did.

Within a few weeks the physical symptoms died out with the sweating taking the longest to disappear around a month a half post quit. Normal sleep returned around the 2 month mark. Around month 3 I started to find myself in a healthier mental state. Sober thought, mental clarity, and genuine emotion all returned. And things just continued to get better. I started to work out and lost 40lbs but also put on about 12lbs of muscle. I bought a car, I am in the process of getting a conviction sealed, and my pharmacist license back. I started writing, I started reading and I started hoping. I started to grow as an individual because I no longer had a chemical to manipulate the way I felt; I either needed to face the problems that life presented head on, or I would continue to suffer.

In the last 7 months I had learned a few very important lessons, one key one being: ""What doesn't kill you, truly does make you stronger, so long as you actually learn something from the thing that almost just killed you"".

What did I learn? I learned that hope does spring eternal and that it's never too late to make a change. I learned that I want to discover who I truly am and I want to help create the individual I truly want to be. I want that individual to be a force of positive change in this world. I dont expect to change the world, but I CAN take care of my little corner of it. I can continue to grow, to learn and to pass on the things I have learned to those who need it the most. I learned that I need a more proactive approach to life and I have learned the dangers of stagnation and avoidance.

Looking back now I must say that quitting kratom, along with everything else, was and is the most difficult thing I ever did. It was and is more difficult than getting my doctorate in pharmacy school or losing all that weight. Being in recovery is the single most difficult task I have undertaken but despite it's hardships, this profound suffering that I had chosen, has raised my self confidence to record heights and it has helped foster a true, honest and significantly more positive self image. I have less physical things but I do consider myself wealthier. I make less money than before but I consider myself considerably richer. I don't take anything to alter my moods but I consider myself significantly happier.

To those who just started this journey: quitting any substance is only the first step, and YES: EASY DOES IT. The time will come however when you will be asking ""What now?"" and you will be thirsting for something you have never thirsted for before: meaning and purpose. This my friends is a sign, a sign that the beginning of the next phase of your life has arrived. You can either embrace it or run away from it. They say the first 30 or 40 years of your life is just research for the rest of it, I can see a great deal of truth in that.

I suggest you put your fears, anxieties and aversions to the test. Burn all that is old and diseased that is found inside, and from the ashes, RISE. Build yourself anew. Understand perhaps the most important lesson of all: Do NOT strive for a happy life, strive for a MEANINGFUL ONE. As the great philosopher Frederich Nietzsche said, ""He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.”

When you find a meaning to life, you have a reason to endure the suffering of existence. You have a purpose greater than your own meager self. A purpose that energizes you and motivates you. A purpose that defines you and molds you. A purpose that simultaneously becomes your revelation, your redemption and one day, your resurrection.

I wish you all health, happiness, peace and not least of all, love.

(This is my first post, looking for some support.)","Hello, I have been using kratom for the past ~2 years, 6-10 grams daily with a few short breaks (2-5 days max.) I have always had anxiety and mild depression, but in the last 6 weeks my anxiety has gotten horrible. I’ve had panic attacks several times a week, and while it seems like I am becoming more able to get through them, my overall depression/sense of being on edge and discontent all the time, is worse. I know that my dosage isn’t very high, but I am just so sick of daily using a substance that doesn’t even affect me the way it originally did; in fact I now suspect it is increasing my anxiety problems whereas before it helped them. Does anyone else feel the same? Furthermore, once you quit kratom, did you eventually start improving as far as anxiety, overall happiness, and mood? When I first started taking kratom I loved the way it felt. To me it was comparable to taking Norco which I also enjoyed way too much. But now I just feel burned out and don’t even know why I’m taking kratom still and spending money on something so stupid that I don’t even need. I’m 22 years old, going to school, have a good job and fairly happy life other than the anxiety and bouts of sadness. I think kratom is a very sneaky drug because we take it for the first time and the stigma is still that it’s not hugely addictive drug, or that it’s healthy, it’s a plant that’s been used for centuries, etc, which for some it may be true, but for people like me with a very addictive personality who enjoy opiates a little too much, kratom can be hard to overcome. I quit last week for about 4 days thinking it was contributing to my anxiety, then the panic attacks were worse again so I said fuck it and bought more. But today, I threw away the last of it and am really determined to make a change. I guess I’m looking for some encouragement and hoping that some other people out there found their anxiety improved after quitting. Also, I am going to see my therapist (who I haven’t seen in 6 months) and also a naturopath/chiropractor in my area, so I’m addressing the anxiety as a separate entity than the kratom issue. But, I am really sensing the two are related.",3

So I had a nasty opiate problem from late teens to about 22, got on methadone(was off everything else,) and got off methadone few years ago. Stuck with mainly weed ever since. I got off everything besides Kratom because I get drug tested for a situation I wasn’t fully involved in (completely honest.) I started using Kratom to stay negative on the tests. Idk if I have a drug problem, or it’s more so a problem with myself. Just not a fully happy person.. I literally found out not even an hour ago they might start testing for Kratom in 2020... and I’m scared, upset with myself, and just freaking out a little. 

I cut out all of my friends for the time being, trying to stay away from drugs (even weed for now.)

None of them know how bad my problem has gotten, and I'm too embarrassed to let them know. So I'm posting here. 

I'm leaving the country in 5 days to see family and I figured it would be a good time to detox, but I've been pushing back the tapering process for weeks now and I'm worried how my body will react once I start withdrawing. Figured I'd do a hard taper this last week to lesson the WD blow (12g the past 2 days, 10g today, etc.) and I've gotten mild cold symptoms and trouble sleeping. Nothing serious, but again, I'm worried what's gonna happen once I cut the dosage too low & too quick...maybe I'll go with 8g today instead of 10, see how it feels...

I tried going cold turkey with Xanax a few years ago after about a month of abuse, and while the withdrawals were probably the worst experience of my life, somehow Kratom is even harder to quit. With Xanax, at the time I had no idea how much of a physical dependence I built, but once I realized, tapering off was a very mechanical/easy process. It took 6 months to finish the taper, but I didn't build any sort of psychological dependence...never got cravings or anything, just sort of scheduled my dosages and went along with my day. Kratom usage has been much easier to justify, and it's been really difficult finding a good 'reason' to quit. It's just so easy to toss and wash every couple of hours throughout the day, and even easier to take a shitton at night and basically nod to sleep. Last time I thought about quitting I lasted less than a day lol....just so easy to tell myself ""I've been through Xanax withdrawals, kratom hardly even compares"".

I get huge cravings when my stomach is empty, and it's basically become ritual to take some kratom before I eat. Sometimes I'd hold off on eating and damn near starve myself just to get that empty stomach kratom hit. But once the stomach is full, the cravings subside. Maybe I need to focus on enjoying food more and kratom less...

Don't rly expect anyone to read that whole thing but I needed to let some brewing thoughts out somewhere, and this seems like a safe place :) hopefully these next 5 days will be easier than I'm expecting. They can't be as bad as CT 28mg/day Xanax withdrawals......",3

A little history on me.  Went to rehab 3 years ago for heroin and percs/Opana addiction.  Ended up on suboxone after being in treatment for 3 months and used it for 2 years and life was wonderful.  Working a program, therapy, and being a good human being.  What drove me to opiates is many injuries from competitive ice hockey, power lifting, snowboarding and other brutal sports I like to do.  So my body is banged up.  I started on Kratom a month or so coming off subs because I didn’t realize how much pain relief that subs gave me even at such a small dose the last 6 months I was on them.  So I picked up kratom for some relief in April.  Started out taking 8g 3xday, and within two months up to 50gpd to feel normal. I should have known better but I convinced myself it was safe and didn’t tell anyone.  Well the time has come that it is completely unmanageable and I was consuming about 70gpd the past week.  Monday I dropped to 10g and it hurt but could function, Tues I did about 20g after a freak out.  And I said fuck it.  I can’t taper cause I’m just dragging this along.  I ripped the bandaid off and last night about 6PM was my last dose.   I have a stock pile of supplements, and detox meds from my doctor.  So far I took chlonidine, 4 lope pills, some kava, grape seed, and normal vitamins regimen.  I actually don’t feel that awful yet but I’m waiting for the other shoe to drop.  I have muscle relaxers and remron to sleep so I know I’ll at least get a few hours.  I’ve been lurking for quite a while since I knew this needed to stop because I was being sneaky and ultimately back to my junkie behavior which I don’t want to live like that.  

Sounds like a lot of people are taking the plunge this week since many of us have time off.  

Good luck everyone.  We can do this! Namaste 🙏🏻",3
2019-12-18 13:54:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/ecgsvl/27_days/,27 days,"Its been 27 days since I quit this sneaky squirrel of a substance. Kratom is the weirdest drug Ive ever abused.  Most days I still have to mentally dig for a reason not to take it, luckily I have many reasons. Its just the first thing my brain starts to think about in the morning. 27 days and I still just go lay on the floor in the living room every night so my kicking legs dont keep my SO awake. Only sleeping about 3 to 4 hours a night. I come back and crawl in bed when shes waking up and can usually catch a hour or two. Some days I feel alright mentally and other days the lack of sleep and lack of neurotransmitters in my brain literally just turn me into a zombie. There is no push to get out of bed, no push to do anything. These are the days I drag myself out to hike up some fairly large hills until I get a good sweat going and it helps a tiny bit. 

 On my better days I am starting to feel good again though. Ive been eating alot better. Ive been going for many hikes and going to play pool multiple times a week which is something I stopped doing when I was taking K. I havent smoked cigs in months and am starting to feel healthy again which is wonderful. Who needs sleep when you can breath. Honestly deep breathing just feels fucking amazing and every time a breath makes it deep into my lungs behind my stomach I know that I am healing. I can just feel itt. Im healing mentally as well albeit much much slower. At the very least I havent ran back to K and that is something. Im abusing marijuana frequently at night because they are SO LONG and my rls just seems to start again every night when Im trying to sleep. I just kick my legs for hours and hours every night and my mind wanders. The weed seems to help me in accepting this process a bit. It also could be prolonging my paws in some way. Who really knows. 

Im going to the Grand Canyon for Xmas! Im am truly excited for this and I dont have to take ANY kratom with me. I am going to leave the weed at home as well to see how it feels to be without it. Plus the Grand Canyon is something Ive always wanted to see and I want to be clear headed. I could cry because this is a huge accomplishment and is going to be just a small taste of the things to come in my life If i stay the course and keep working to improve myself. My Girlfriend has been a real trooper through all of this and has really had my back mentally. I couldnt ask for a kinder more caring person honestly. I cant wait for her and I to be able to breathe a little easier and have a little wholesome fun together. 

 Im not perfect. Ive taken 2 xanaxs spaced out over this month to try and pass out for a night. I still am smoking the weed but I have stayed away from the Kratom and i can see the improvements in my life begining to show and I feel excited for the future some days instead of just fear. I am much more in tune with my Girlfriend and I am slowly becoming myself again. Im just grateful I jumped when I did. Fear is the thief of dreams and I waited so long to quit simply because I was scared. That reasoning kept me in active addicition for so long and it basically made the withdrawls worse because I just kept taking kratom instead of quitting.  Today I almost have 1 month. Hope everyone out there is staying strong. 

To Anyone that is still taking Kratom because they are scared of the withdrawls...... The withdrawls arent what you should be scared about. You need to be scared about what you are missing out on while you are taking Kratom. Be scared about not being completely present in your life.  I shouldve taken this vacation a year ago and theres so much I missed out on because all i gave a fuck about was the next dose. Kratom stole from me and there is no getting anything I missed out on back. I can only stop it from taking anything else from me.",14

Only realized about 2 years ago how its controlling my life just like any other addiction..  I am almost 2 years sober from all drugs and alcohol but have been living this delusion, convincing myself it's ok when it's not.  I've become so obsessed with the K it's controlling my life, personality, relationships, health...... the $$$$ I've spent on it! OMG the $$$$ I've spent...

 Last year I got some blood work back that said my liver enzymes were elevated. I finally realized that it was the K that had been doing this to me because of the amount I was taking, and always doing toss  and wash so god knows really how much o was actually taking.   It it scared me enough to quit and I was able to stay off of it for 2 months when one day I was so tired and lethargic that I gave in and went and bought a small bag after that it was all over again for 6 months then I tried to quit again and managed to stay off of it for a week but yet again I gave in.

 I've tried to quit multiple times and have never been successful because the mental obsession to want that extra energy in the morning kicks in and takes over. I have 5 days off coming up starting this Saturday and I HAVE to get off of it for good, this thread has truly been inspirational and motivating to hear people's stories and the way people feel towards this stuff like I do. Thank you. 

 I wanna be healthy I wanna have natural motivation and and an umph for life again... K has taken all of that away from me I take it in the morning because I need it to get-up-and-get going but then throughout the day it takes all of my personality away all of my energy way and I just feel sluggish and disgusting by the end of the day. Ive become dependent on laxatives and milk of magnesia because I can't poop if I don't take that stuff every other night  WTF?!! That's not normal..... 

I just hate what ive let this stuff do to me.  I want my life back.  I want clarity in my day back.  Im just posting to start the accountability.  I really appreciate all of you that post your experiences on here and thank you.  I have 3 more days of work left before the plunge...",21

The last time I quit was about 2 years ago.  I had been using the stuff for a year or so, but I was getting ready for a month long trip to southeast Asia.  I know that it is illegal in most of the countries there, and I was not confident in my ability to find it there.  I underestimated, that time, the level of addiction it carries, and I waited until about a week out to start cutting.  It was not enough time, and left me with ice water in my veins for about the last 3 days before I left for my trip... And honestly, I don't think I felt right until about a week into the trip.

I'm leaving for another month in that part of the world in mid January, and this time, I've started way ahead... This week, in fact.  My habit, realistically, had gotten to about 20g, 3 or 4 times per day.  I'm aware that I'm pretty addicted.  Three days ago, I cut those doses in half.  I can definitely feel the ice water, but it's starting to get better to where the half dose makes me feel normal.

My next step will probably be completely removing the mid-day dose.  I'm feeling confident that I gave myself plenty of time this time around, and that with the help of a slow taper, some 5HTP and maybe some psilocybin micro dosing, I'll have my dopamine normal and be feeling fine by trip time.

I also plan on staying off it for good, this time.  It's been fun, but I'm not a chronic pain sufferer, so there's really no excuse to stay with an addiction... Especially one which, for me, includes sexual side effects.

Edit:. 4 days later and still slowly tapering.  My sleep is definitely disrupted, but honestly I was sleeping too much anyway.",7

I was taking a VERY high dose of gabapentin (3600MG) for about two months and stopped taking it two 48 hours ago. I haven't noticed much yet im hoping I may have dodged a bullet with this as I was not aware of dependency issues that are possible with gaba. However I received my Bio - Tuner in the mail yesterday and plan on implementing it into my daily routine . I think this may be a very beneficial aide in the recovery process. I am very fascinated with all the research (specifically on people with addiction issues) I have been in active addiction for 10 + years and never heard of it until researching this sub for days.  If you have an extra 300 bucks lying around I would recommend looking into it, do some research yourself and you will find fascinating results . someone who has also struggled with major depressive dissorder and GAD for most of my life SSRI's seem to only work for a short period of time before ineffective for my brain chemistry .

Struggling to taper when working 50+ hrs a week, at an intense job - not making much progress. I have an overseas trip I’m planning with my wife to her home country with 3-4 weeks off work (will probably never be allowed so much time again). 

I do not want to be a drag for my wife. There is a lot we are planning to do, . 

My choices are: 

Get on a suboxone taper ,  bringing a small amount with me, maybe jumping after the trip starts.
Taper down before the trip and bring bottles of capsules
Quit suddenly a few days before the flight- this will delay the amount of time we can spend there because I’d need 6 days at home to suffer through the worst. Haven’t bought tickets yet, doing that real soon, so need to decide.

I don’t want to be a burden, this is a once in a lifetime trip for us. With my use history I think I will suffer long past a week. I dread getting on a plane for over a day still sick, but it may be the best chance I have of getting off this for good , being in a foreign country with no access that long. Here the kratom store is 10 min away. I’ll have to be strong for her. 

I haven’t decided yet. She leans toward me just bringing capsules and taper so we get more time there, she wants me to enjoy the trip. id suffer doing that too, dropping to a more reasonable 5g day or less to not raise suspicion having more than 2 bottles of caps. She really wants me to keep tapering and quit someday.

I think I need to find support. Go to my dr, get clonidine. Maybe schedule a therapist. Maybe NA. 

So those who have quit high dose for years, can I be functioning decent after a week? From what I’ve read I may not be in good shape for over a month.",1

Yes i woke up many times turning and in the middle of the night i drank so more kava kava but hey... better each day! Making good progress. This morning for the first time i took a cold shower and right after that i did the Wim Hof breathing method and felt spectacular afterwards. I will do this now everyday! Today i will see a friend which i havent seen pretty much the hole 8 years on kratom. I had never the urge to see my best friend, its crazy. Now it all comes back. I still have some pain in my tonsil when i swallow. Does somebody notice this also ? Maybe stucked emotions ? I dont know really. I still have anxiety in the morning but its totally managable at this point. No problem at all. 1-2 shells of kava takes care of that. Last night i drank 10g CBD hemp (3%). Which is 300mg CBD. I have some more for a few days then going off the hemp and just using kava kava. When i will sleep well WITH the kava kava i get off the kava kava also and just exercise, eat healthy and use the SOTA Bio-Tuner for a few more weeks to completly heal my brain and get my neurochemistry perfectly balanced again. Actually i already feel normal again, which i am very thankfull for. At this point just some lingering physical weakness (which got better today dramatically maybe because i finally got 7 hours sleep) some lingering anxiety and thats it!

I could never taper cause I’m an addict and have no control. I had been attending a 12 step group and had a lot of support on my side. My sponsor was with me through it all. I detoxed are his house the first couple days. I’m not gonna sugar coat and tell you it was easy. The first 5 days were hell and the next couple months that followed were emotionally and physically tough. I heard from a guy at a meeting early on that “depression can’t hit a moving target” and that stuck with me so I did whatever I could to keep myself busy. No matter what, I was gonna be doing something. Most days I didn’t wanna get out of bed or do anything. It took serious action for a guy like me to do it. It was different than what I was used too.

Pretty heavy usage, I'm not sure the exact dosage as I was just taking spoonfuls out and dosing like that. I go through about a kilo in a month or less typically. So I guess an estimate would be about 33 Gpd. Recently I have been using much less around 10-15 gpd if i had to estimate. Today, I didn't dose until around 2pm and only took around maybe 4 grams, possibly less. Took the same dose about 45 minutes ago. My plan to is CT from now on unless it gets absolutely unbearable and then I will take a minor dose if necessary. To be completely honest, I feel much better as it is not having massive doses in my system at all times. Has anyone CT from pretty extended and heavy usage? What can I expect in terms of symptoms and for how long?

I was 9 months sober from heroin and coke when I picked up kratom and really saw it as a harmless solution. After 9 months of use I found myself just as miserable and self-loathing as I was shooting speedballs. In detox I bought some suboxone from another patient (stupid) and also relapsed in kratom the night I got out. After that I just smoked weed to help with sleep for the next few nights and July 23rd dropped all substances and went back to AA. Life right now is better than I could have even imagined. I can exist in society without feeling apart from or less than. I have a group of friends that hold each other accountable and enough hobbies/responsibilities to keep me busy without feeling overwhelmed. Shit is not perfect and I don’t expect it to be. I have awful days where I am ready to give it all up but I find every time I push through those dark moments I come out stronger, with even more reason to keep going.

That was one of the best decisions I have made in the last view years. Nearly every aspect of my life got better:

.) I no longer have to dose every 6 hours
.) I no longer have this nasty green dust  everywhere
.) I no longer have to think about it 24/7
.) I no longer skip meals just to get a better rush
.) My testosterone levels have literally exploded. I feel MUCH stronger and my gains in the gym are much faster. Also my beard growth got way better.
.) My erectile dysfunction vanished
.) I no longer daydream the whole day and actually do things
.) I no longer feel like a junky

Don't get me wrong, there are still things that are not going as great:

.) I miss kratom's ability to numb my feelings and to kill time.
.) I often still feel unmotivated and do nothing
.) I have gained weight
.) I miss the intense rush the first dose in the morning combined with a cigarette gave me

Still, the benefits far outweigh the cons so I will never go back to taking kratom or any other opiod drug.
I also quit smoking cigarettes 3 weeks ago and weed 8 days ago so I don't know if this is causing the negative stuff.

Your mindset is everything. The absolute hatred of kratom and pumping yourself up is huge in terms of how you feel. Even if you have a weak mind, like myself, if I pump myself up, think about how much better my life will be once I'm done, it helps so damn much. 

I know people get nervous about withdrawals. In fact, I've been planning to quit this month so many times, and I didn't because I was scared. But man, I've done this so many times, and the times where I committed, had a strong mindset, told myself Im awesome, were so much easier.

Zero sleep, excruciating muscle, and joint aches... etc. Btw I'm probably calling Day 2 Day 1... I decided to quit and went all day on Dec 15. So Dec 16... depending on how you look at it was either day 1 or 2. Anyway.

The morning of (what I'm calling) Day 2 is here and I was able to sleep 3 hours last night, so I feel a bit better physically, but most of the other symptoms still persist. My mental state has changed, for sure. I don't know ""what"", but I just feel off today. Maybe it's paws starting... seems too early for that but I know we're all different. That scares me a bit because I know that's where a lot of people lose this battle, when it goes inside the mind. I can definitely feel a shift in my frame of mind today. I feel very, odd. Very odd. 

Anyway, whatever it is... I'll get through it. I am without a doubt, done with this toxic sludge. I hope you all have a good day today.",3

I’ve realized that kratom has consumed my life. It doesn’t help that my mother still uses and sometimes supports my addiction by buying me some or giving me some. I’ll sometimes find myself lurking around the house and looking through my mother’s things trying to find enough kratom to get my fix. It’s pathetic and I cannot live my life like this.

I have a passion for mathematics and logic. I don’t want my gifts to go to waste because of a dependency on something that functions like an opioid. There’s more to life than kratom.

Last night I had a dream that I was seduced by what I can only describe as an old witch. Despite being repulsed by her naked body I still gave in. Kratom is the witch and I no longer want to be seduced by her.

Every single time I think I was making a change I’d have a MAJOR setback. I thought I was ridding myself of such an awful curse. Boy was I such a fool. 
I’d get where I’d need to be. I’d be doing good I’d be beating it. Lately I have not. I just fall back on this shit only to feel worse off than when I did in the beginning whenever I was getting rid of this fucking toxic shit. 

I walked out on my job yesterday. I went off. I exploded using every single bit of mental anguish in me that’s built up over the past year. I told them weeks ago I needed a vacation ASAP. I was told the week after Christmas. Well. My vacation was given to someone else. I was so pissed off, so raged. I need this vacation to rid myself of such a curse. I’m tired of hiding. I finally had to break down, and just explain every single event that’s led me to be such a mess.. every. single. event. I had to recount the times that my life went to hell. I had to go over all of that. AGAIN. Thank god or whoever it be that I was asked to stay and granted the much needed time off of work. 

Good news is, I was given my vacation. The week after Christmas I am dropping every single bag of Kratom in my sight. I am not taking another capsule, not another tablespoon, not even a TEASPOON. I have had it. My hands are in the air. I’m surrendering myself to the worst that’s to come. I’m cold turkeying. This stuff has absolutely ruined the once bright and cheerful person I once was. It’s ruined relationships. It’s ruined my hobbies and interests. It’s made a wreckage of what little life I have had. I’m done. I hope this will be the last time I actually attempt something because well if I don’t, then I will give up. I’m tired of not living a normal life. Not having everything that most have. What should be easy & normal for me to have, is out of reach.. life will get better. One way or another. If there’s anything you can mention that will make this a much smoother transition.. please let me know below. I’ve allowed my own happiness to be taken from me.",46

I have been a long time off and on again kratom user.  I started using in December of 2017.  That's 2 years of on again and off again use.  I have quit and subsequently withdrawn at least 10-12 times.  Some major, mostly minor.  My usage varies, but recently I was taking about 20-26mgs a day, in one dose.  I use to do 10-15 a few times a day, so there has been minor improvement.

This latest stint lasted about 2 months.  I moved to a new city and started a new job.  It started great so I told myself a little wouldn't hurt, so I fell right back into addiction.

Prior to this recent stint, I had a few weeks of minor withdrawal after taking again for a couple of weeks.

This current withdrawal hasn't been too bad until this morning.

All weekend I got to lay around and smoke weed and eat edibles.  I slept a lot and other than some intense yawning, I was OK.

This morning has been tough.  My body is restless and hurts.  I have zero energy to work and just want to go home and go to bed.  I've been getting by.  

I have about an hour and a half of work left, but it's going by so slow.  I feel horrible.

I am around 29 hours ""clean"". I've been taking Kratom for around a year, and abusing it for around 9 months, it didn't take long.

I realize now, that this substance has become so important to my life that almost everything revolved around that. I am disgusted with myself to be honest. 

What I did, is I underestimated the shit out of this plant, in every possible way. I also underestimated the WDs. It is 8:00am here, I didn't sleep literally at all last night. Kept getting hot/cold, RLS out the ass. I will be honest, this is much tougher than I thought. I have 7oz or so of Kratom in the SAME ROOM an arms length away, but I refuse to go back into this abyss. 

Kratom has nearly, and may have, ruined my life. My wife found out I was taking it, and that didn't go well at all. I did what I think several of us do, I hid it from day 1. That's a crappy move on my part. I won't go into more detail now, but suffice to say, Kratom may have literally taken my life away from me. I hope none of you are in the same boat. 

I'm going to work now, wish me luck. Sure to be an awesome day with no sleep and going through this. 

I think what would help me... (and the truth please), how long can I expect total insomnia, wild emotions, RLS and general muscle aches? I know everyone is different... but would love some perspective.

Right now I’m feeling both relieved and horrified.  Every time I think about quitting, I feel like I’m about to leave earth for some other hostile planet, like I’m never going to be able to truly enjoy a sunset or music or human company again.  It has become such a crutch in every aspect of my daily life that I feel a sense of deep impending loss whenever I start to get serious about ditching it, but I know it needs to happen.  I’ve had mental health problems for most of my life, and it allowed me to maintain a level of productivity, functionality, and general happiness that I’d never known before.   That being said, I’ve also had a problem with alcohol for a long time, and while it helped me to cut back on drinking for a time, I have gotten into the habit of using it along with alcohol in very unhealthy ways.  I’m tired of damaging my body like this, which I almost certainly am.  I’m tired of the expense, hiding it from everyone in my life, relying on it to function, being constipated all the time, etc, etc.  I also want to have a child someday, and I’m in nowhere near the place I need to be for order for that to happen.

Problem is kratom effects me psychologically different than most. It causes paranoia and psychosis to varying degrees even with low doses.

Not waking up (well kinda not sleeping still) with dread and fear and guilt which I think makes my days better all around. The thing that sucks the most is the anxiety bursts at night but I almost am ok with them knowing that this is part of the process and there’s no free lunch with this kinda stuff. It’s def not as bad as a lot of horror stories as I’ve read, at least for me. Don’t get me wrong, not sleeping sucks, those bursts of anxiety I can literally feel in my chest suck BUT what’s most important is I can feel myself being myself again. Not totally outta the woods yet. Went to a meeting yesterday and sat still. I love aa but from what I’ve learned in the 10 or so years I’ve been doing it is everyone’s recovery can look different and I’m pretty proud of myself for catching this when I did so whatever. Day 5 lookin forward to day 6. Y’all can do it, addiction with Kratom for me was very much fear based. I was so scared of stopping as I feared I wouldn’t be able to function, but I functioned just fine. Just a little off with some dumbass symptoms I brought onto myself. It’ll pass even if it feels like it won’t I promise. Felt shitty for an hour last night thought it wouldn’t pass but here I am today, no feelings of anxiety. First 3 days are stupid bc I was used to my routine and I’ve kinda broken out of that so starting the days are a little easier. I like reading this forum in the middle of the night so imma keep coming and posting with the hopes it might help someone bc it’s helped me. Windy as fuck in la today hope everyone’s Kratom doesn’t blow into my mouth. Good luck today y’all, the shit feelings will absolutely pass",6

Actually not as bad as I thought it would be. Then I did a week cold turkey about two months ago as I was in a sudden situation where I couldn’t get any K but as soon as I got out I scored. Now I’m back to where I started and this seems to be the hardest part. I’m rejoining this community (if you all will have me lol) for some accountability. 

I don’t even get high anymore, I just get un-sick. I have had serious problems with opiates in the past but for some reason this is harder. 

Are extreme depression and social anxiety normal even while still using?

Any advice or tips or anything to give me willpower would be greatly appreciated. I know I couldn’t have quit the first time without this group.",4
2019-12-15 04:04:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/eawulh/if_youre_considering_trying_kratom_because_its/,"If you're considering trying kratom because it's withdrawals ""are not as bad as other opioids' withdrawals"", please read this...","Lope, sub, hydro and oxy we were literally nothing compared to the unnecessary hell that is kratom withdrawals.  Any time I say this literally anywhere else on the internet, I get a bunch of kratom feinds jumping at my throat.  I've quit the first few opioids mentioned many times, and it was hell each time.  I developed a protracted and heavy addiction to each of them, and in my time using these opioids I alternated between them and used them in conjunction with other drugs on occasion and quit them and relapsed many times.  But kratom's withdrawals took the cake with respect to severity by far.  I've never truly needed to be hospitalized during opioid withdrawal, because while I was a sweaty crying mess stuck in the fetal position my vitals were ok.  When I got off my 35-45gpd habit I had all the same symptoms but the psychological pain, insomnia, aches and adrenaline driven mania were hard to describe with words or any common experience, and were definitely not even comparable to withdrawal from other opioids.  I was hospitalized after about a week sober with a heart rate of 150 and a bp of 180 over 110 that was slowly rising.  It's one thing to feel like dying during withdrawals and another thing to be genuinely afraid of your heart stopping with a cardiac team by your side in the hospital.  I was given Ativan and I quickly calmed down to what seemed to feel like just some regular good old familiar opioid withdrawal.  People probably will be inclined to think that kratom can't have withdrawal anywhere near as bad as traditional opioid withdrawals because ""so many people"" (we really don't know how many really succeed) use it to ween off successfully... right?  Well, the science behind why kratom is just as addictive as any other opioid, if not worse, is very simple.  

The fact of the matter is that while kratom does contain the nonaddictive and nondependence forming mitragynine, which is deserving of research as a solution to the opioid crisis, it also contains 7-oh-mitragynine, which is as addictive as any other opioid, produces dependence by the same mechanism, is about 15-20x as potent as morphine, and found in kratom in concentrations of anything from 0.03-0.06%.  

This means that a 5 gram dose of kratom contains about 1.5-3mg of this compound that can be absorbed, which translates to a really large amount of opiates. 

On the lower end, this is equivalent to about ~22.5-30mg of morphine, ~15-20mg of oxycodone and ~25-35mg of hydrocodone.  On the upper end, this is ~45-60mg of morphine, ~30-40mg of oxycodone, and ~55-70mg of hydrocodone.  This is a lot.  1g of kratom is almost the equivalent of a therapeutic dose of opioids, maybe higher...

On top of this kratom contains compounds that behave as stimulants, antidepressants, mild antipsychotics, sedatives, and even a compounds that acts as a alpha2 adrenergic agonist, much like clonidine, which is known to significantly potentiate opioids and increase their likeability (although most of these aspects are capable of intensifying an opioid high).  With this increase in effect comes an increase in ultimately withdrawals and their severity.  Because of this, it really shouldn't be that surprising how heavy the withdrawals could be from it.

But kratom's alkaloid mitragynine is something that is truly fascinating.  It does not cause dependence and does not substitute for heroin or morphine but ameliorates withdrawals in rats and is incredibly safe too, not producing respiratory depression very easily.  It seems to mirror Suboxone in this manner, but seems to impart these effects even more.  On top of that other alkaloids present in kratom seem to have potential to treat depression.  A kappa opioid antagonist derivative from one of kratom's alkaloids seems to be able to treat depression by a mechanism completely unrelated to medication used today.  Depression is a disorder that is currently not treated well enough with a success rate of only 70%, meaning that 30% are getting insignificant or no benefit at all from medication.  It could get people currently using opioids medically to treat pain without the potential for addiction.  The only way we can further research these compounds is if we keep kratom legal.  

On top of that making kratom illegal will result in a bunch of people desperate to treat withdrawals finding street opioids, and not knowing how to dose may overdose, resulting in many more victims to the opioid crisis.

The way the internet has been treating kratom lately has been scary to say the very least.  The scariest thing I've seen was a guy who was on an antidepressant(Zoloft), antipsychotic (halperidol), benzotropine for the side effects from halperidol, and hydroxyzine.  He said he was dropping all of the drugs his doctor prescribed him cold turkey and taking kratom instead.  He was asking the internet if he should be concerned about liver problems from kratom.  People supported this guy in his decision and I'm pretty sure he had a psychotic reaction when I told him he should be more worried about addiction and the psychological consequences of dependence.  This is a truly unacceptable way to treat kratom and should not be encouraged in any way or form.",13

Managed to finally sleep some more hours than yesterday. Made it to 5 hours yay! Yesterday evening i heated up 20g hemp flower powder (3% CBD 0.2%THC) in butter till it get a little brown to activate the cannabinoids filled up with milk cooked it up sweeten and there you go...  Then in drank the half at 7PM together with highly sedating kava kava. Then right before bed again some shells kava kava and the other half of my hemp drink. It was a good night, altough only slept 5 hours i felt quite relaxed and good just laying in bed, finally shure with the help from hemp and kava kava but hey better then the last days. So the second week is finally comming to an end and i look forward to the third week where things will improve further. Today was the first day working out again right after getting up. However i only managed jogging for about 12 minutes this morning because i'm so exhausted and weak but it really helps to lower this morning anxiety which is still there but got less intense today, where yesterday it was the worst. I have the impression that the anxiety gets worse in the second week and then subsides in the third week. I think the physical weakness will be there for a while,, also the kava kava and shurely the hemp is contributing to that but right now sleep is more important to me. So i make good progress and i am proud of me that i had the willpower to quit completly after 8 long years with 4-5 breaks. My conclusion: It doesnt matter how long, how often and how much you took. Just push through the first 10-14 days and you will be feeling so much better already. Then go from there to 30 days and you eventually feel completly normal again! Even if it takes longer.... what are two, three or four months ? Other people suffer their whole lifes with chronic illnessess far worse. I think when we drink kratom we forget all the worries and the pain and we get pussies. But real life is not always pain free. If you get sober you get something that kratom never could give you and which kratom actually takes away from you: Real deep emotions, feeling alive, feel the music the nature, friends and so much more! I wish you all the best and maximum success in quitting kratom!",3

Lasted a full 24 hours, just took a couple grams of K to be able to sleep, but this is looking really good for a taper for me.

At the max of my usage I was using once every hour and now I just went 14 hours or so without it. And took a half teaspoon less than usual. Maybe tomorrow I’ll be able to go 15 hours :) I know a lot of people here reccomend CT but I want to at least minimize the withdrawals because I really need sleep and already have issues with that I also really don’t want to have severe depression so I’m training my brain and body slowly that it doesn’t need it. What helped me get through these 14 hours was waking up this morning and instead of laying there all groggy and sulking in my pain or getting up and dosing I hopped out of bed and got to work. I had a to do list for the day and I got straight to it while listening to motivational uplifting music and trying to hold the vibration of motivation and happiness into my body. Of course it got harder to do as time went by and the withdrawals got stronger but truly you can control the vibration in your body through practice and determination. I’m also thinking about taking some kratom and flushing it down the toilet to subliminally program myself that I don’t need it and that it doesn’t serve me. It’s all about the subconscious, I’ve been subconsciously brainwashing myself to take more and more Kratom by constantly dosing and taking Kratom so now I’m trying to reprogram myself and I’m getting results. Ide say doing the opposite of what you would normally do doing taper or ct is the best thing to do. If you want to not eat than go make a nice healthy meal, if you want to lay around then get up and go for a run, if you want to take Kratom then don’t take Kratom. It’s all about training your mind and staying in an uplifting vibration. Wake up and feel grateful for what you have and go do something with a positive attitude. Think about how you want to feel and embody that feeling. Think about a time in life before Kratom where you felt happy and satisfied completely sober and try to embody the feeling. This helped me a lot in my tapering process and just wanted to share.",24

I just finally decided that Kratom, or any other drug for that matter wasn’t going to run my life anymore, and life has been an absolute emotional roller coaster. I’ve probably cried every day since, but also laughed like I’ve never have before. It’s all about learning to ride the wave, and embrace the fact that you’re not always going to feel that great. 

Sobriety isn’t linear like we all expect it to be, just go back and look at my posts. I felt great at day 30 and terrible at day 40-45. 

I don’t feel anxious and on edge anymore, like I did all the time on and off k. Im re learning who the hell I am, and don’t feel so hopeless all the time.

I have used kratom on and off for two years, with my biggest break being 3 months about a year ago. Before this latest quit I had spent a really distressing 4 months going back and forth between using and withdrawals, trying to “chip.” I found the experiment successful in that I learned that any use at all throws me right back into full-on physical dependency. During that four months, even when not using, I obsessed over it constantly, I cried extremely easily and was an emotional wreck, basically going through a fresh hell of acute withdrawals every few days. 

What got me to quit was the exhaustion of trying to hide it from my family. I was an anxious wreck whenever not using and it was annihilating my ability to enjoy life or serve anyone without extreme self pity. 

I walked into my first AA meeting on a Monday, sobbed my way through a confession about where I was at, and all the isolation I felt. It was a huge relief to end the dishonesty for a second. Immediately a couple guys came over and checked on me. They gave me their numbers and a Big Book, and told me to call them. I did, reluctantly. The first person I called was an avuncular older dude, and he became my sponsor. He said to call him every day just to check in. By Thursday I felt supported enough to jump off Kratom. 

Acutes were terrible and long. By day 6 or 7 I had glimpses of feeling ok for moments, then the wave of panic and exhaustion would hit. Using megadoses of vitamin C helped during the transition from acutes to PAWS. The waves became less severe and less frequent, but they continued, and still do. About day 10, during a particularly terrible wave, I decided to go back on escitalopram, an SSRI that I had gone off during my kratom use because it wasn’t doing anything. That, combined with beginning daily NAC and Sarcosine at the same time, began a new phase of improving PAWS. The waves continued to decrease in frequency and severity.

During this time I attended AA meetings daily and met with my usual therapist weekly. These were highly illuminating because I was speaking out loud daily about a transformation that was extremely subtle instead of isolating and being alone with these thoughts. I called my sponsor every day and met with him weekly, working the steps. I’m still very new in the program, but I love the community and feel the warmth of knowing a group of people who are so different but have something in common that no one else in my life understands: powerlessness over addiction.

The clear and brilliant joy of the AA group, these people who were undergoing spiritual transformations despite losing their families, jobs, homes, etc, was a deep mystery to me, and something I began to want badly. I was still feeling a lot of self pity three weeks into sobriety and wondered how I could have what they have. The Big Book was clear that it takes a faith in a higher power - something I was not ready for. I have always felt like people with faith are being swindled and had too rational of a mind to let myself give myself to it.

Then I went on a 4 day silent retreat. It had been on my schedule for months and I had initially intended to jump on this retreat. During that weekend, I made a deal with myself. I decided I needed what these people had more than I needed to be right, and that, for now, I would try to accept a higher power without trying to understand it. I’ll avoid preaching here and just say, that moment was powerful and what happened is something I did not see coming. What I experienced, and have tried to nurture in the week since, is the sense that I am loved as I am, and the joy and peace that comes from that knowledge. Speaking to my therapist since, I think the idea of the understanding and acceptance of a higher power is a direct replacement or supplement for the acceptance I never felt from my own father.

Anyway, this is just my story. I hope everyone is doing ok. If you’re suffering, know that you will make it. The only advice I can give is, don’t isolate. Shame will hold you back. Being understood will free you. That’s what I gathered anyway from all this. Be well.",8

So I'm on day 9 off of Kratom BUT I did go through a medically supervised detox that gave me subutex and tramadol on a quick taper for the first 5 days, so I'm only 4 days off of everything opioid. Which means I'm not able to take my Naltrexone just yet but 3 more days to go! 

So I've been frantically researching how to help with PAWS because previously when I've detoxed from kratom, it's the PAWS that hits me around day 8 will drive me crazy (suicidal ideation) and I succumb to it on day 10 and relapse. So I need to not get that low this time. I have been exercising every day since I've been out of detox, so 3 days in a row and will go today - maybe that will be a game changer.

I have had treatment-resistant depression for half of my life, and I think I'm more vulnerable to the depression that PAWS brings. I am on lexapro currently, so already on an antidepressant. What I would like to know is is there anything out there I should be looking into besides exercise? Medication-wise, supplement-wise, or alternative medicine-wise? I bought some SAME-E, some Omega-3s, and some GABA to help my brain but I still am not sure what is a game changing supplement to help my brain regrow?

Maybe my biggest mistake is that I still drink and occasionally use other drugs. Whenever I’m under the influence of alcohol or these drugs, I get cravings. I’ve never given in, and I won’t ever. But I just want to forget about this god awful drug. 

The spot I’m in - in my life - isn’t where I should be. I’m more depressed than I should be, and I haven’t moved past my addictive behavior. 

For those who are still at the beginning of their journey - trust me when I say it’s better where I’m at. I was, BY FAR, way more of a depressed, lazy, useless fuck on Kratom than now. The only thing Kratom did was mask my pain. 

But I’m just wondering how I deal with that pain now. That itch. That constant itch. Any veterans (or recent quitters?) here want to explain what changes they made in their lives? 

If I’m being honest, once I quit exercising due to a serious injury (no opioids, no painkillers - just toughed it out) things got worse for me. But I feel myself slipping into my old addictive behavior ways. I guess I should take a break from drinking. 

I know a lot of you began Kratom to quit drinking in the first place (or to address various mental health issues. I did the same) 

But how are you guys coping now? 

Best wishes to everyone and I know this post sounds depressing but I assure you IT IS NOT. I am making this post because I want to *stay* off this shit. It will not get the best of me nor will it get the best of any of you if you truly want to be off it. And quite frankly I need to vent to people who understand. I just don’t know anybody who understands how opioids affect people 

And to whoever is going through withdrawals right now - it gets better, I promise. It will be a distant echo of a memory soon enough. If you’re able - if you can exercise or run - do it. I bet you all my money, I bet you my 159 days, you’ll feel better. The problem is getting adjusted to a life where you don’t have a means to completely ignore your issues. Man. Issues, issues, issues.

I am taking this journey tonight to gain insight for the future, forgiveness for the past year of being stuck on kratom and self examination to insure I never allow something like this to gain such a tight hold on me. I have suffered more this year mentally then all of my life. I think it was one day when I was drinking that green gunk and gagging it up just to swallow back to make sure I got my fix that I looked in the mirror and didn't see a man anymore. I saw a slave, no longer free to go or do anything without my master. I apologize if psilocybin is taboo around here but 2 years ago it changed my life from a serious opioid habit then I allowed Kratom in thinking it was mild with no risk of w/d. I thought of it kinda like cbd. I was wrong. I found a new buzz and fell in love. Then my love story turned into a twisted tragedy.. it is ending tonight.",14

Slept again only 3 hours, but somehow i think that doesnt matter much, because i dont feel like i have too little sleep acutally. And i mean this for the whole 12 days. Are you guys had the same experience ?  Yesterday evening in drank 10g of weak industrial hemp. It has 3% CBD and 0.2% THC. It worked so good with the kava i could sleep at 9PM, but only till 11PM then maybe another hour. But i felt good laying in the bed it was not painfull and restless anymore, so that is great. Maybe its also because i started taking black cumin seed oil yesterday as my digestion is coming back to normal and i can digest it now. So now i sit here without anxiety and writing this post on day 12 drinking another 10g of this hemp. Think about it: 10g of 0.2% THC is like 1g of 2% THC and like 0.1g 20% THC which is a good dosage of THC + massive amounts of CBD. It really works much better than CBD only this way. This hemp is legal here in Germany and pretty cheap :) How did i take it ? I pulverised to a fine powder then I've put some butter in a pot along with the 10g hemp powder. I rosted it (not to hot to loose the cannabinoids - but you need to roast the get them synthesized) then filled up with milk or soy milk and let it cook for 1 minute. Then just sweeten if you want and drink! I feel really good now and i'm very happy! :-) Lets see how i feel when it kicks in. Maybe i can get a little bit more sleep even. Boys and girls finally no anxiety in the morning anymore. Lets see what the day brings... I very happy that i am off off this stuff for good. Now i have to urge to make the very best of the rest of my life!

Later this day it got worse again. Strong anxiety, no motivation, no energy, worn out from 12 days 3-4 hours of sleep. Wonder when i will be able to sleep again. Drinking some kava kava now to relax. Boy its exhausting...

I noticed that i didnt vape any CBD today, maybe this is why i feel worse today ?

EDIT: YES it was the missing CBD.... no i vaped and i feel so much better...",5

Since I jumped a few days ago, things have been pretty good(relative to hell).  Every bump in the road is just a puzzle to figure out on my way to dropping kratom forever.  I get excited every time I overcome something. 

However, i was having some pretty gnarly heart palpitations, so I read up on opioid wd and realized it was, ""normal"".  No worries, right? 

Then they kept getting worse and chest pain started accompanying them.  I would wake up with a racing heart and when I checked my pulse it was skipping a lot of beats.  Needless to say, it kind of freaked me out and I started reading again.  
Found out about the increased risk of heart trouble, and even heart failure when people CT from opioids. 

So I was considering taking a gram or two a day to taper more slowly.  But I really didn't want to, so I kept reading.  

Now I know, in detail how dangerous taking kratom is for your entire system, including your heart. 

So I'm not sure what to do anymore.  I can't see a doctor.  It's just not possible right now.  Don't want a stroke.  

Any suggestions?",2

I'm doing pretty good too. 7 years of regularly use, daily most of that time, 15-20 gpd. Several quit attempts thisyear but this last one took for me in a new way. I have to admit these past few days i've been missing it. not cravings, just feeling like it's been forever even though it's only been a month. I've been feeling better, sleeping better for sure. And more aware of emotions. Not waking up cold and shaky every morning. My weed intake has definitely increased, and pretty sure i've put on some weight, those are two things I didn't really need. i know it's gonna be tempting to get some K for Christmas and New Year's but I feel like I got this. So to anyone struggling, stick with it. if you're relapsing, try to learn from it, pick yourself up as soon as you can and try another quit. that's my best advice anyway. I feel that it was trying 3 quits in a row this fall, only letting relapses go 5-7 days, that help me understand more of what was going on with me and got me the momentum to move on.

Always looking online for a miracle cure and something that was natural, I  then came across ""Kratom"".

That was approx 6 years ago at first I thought I was in control and I had found the answer to all my issues and problems, ""this stuff really did work"", I went from taking approx a 6g dose once every  2-3 days to within 4 months  because of the confidence and effects it was giving me went onto taking it daily, then onto twice daily then on to 3-4 times daily.

Then the issue was I wasn't getting the same feeling and effect that I originally had so I started to take more, and before I knew it I was shocked to see I was taking approx 12g in a single dosing, approx 4x daily.

This was all within approx a 1.5 years and I have been ADDICTED ever since, i tried about 2 years ago and went cold turkey as I had run out and after 6 days of PURE hell of not sleeping and restless legs I had to give in and reordered and I have never tried to quit since as I was afraid of going back to that WD HELL place.

6 Years have passed and I have to stop my health is in a Bad Place, Im on Testosterone replacement, I have No motivation, Im depressed and the fatigue is horrendous and I haven't been to the gym in 2 years which was a big part of my life I feel like a man of 70.

This week I made the decision to join the group and try to stop once and for all, this week I have cut down to doses of approx 2.5g using when the WD is at its worst using about 16g a day (Which is Good for me), but the WD's are definitely kicking in, at night it is at its worst and Im having to dose at about 2am then 6am, the restless legs and the agitation are the worst along with the Hot Sweats and cravings to take more to make all the hurt go away.

This time I am going to get through this and get my life back on track as I cannot live like this anymore my life is miserable and controlled by this ""Evil Stuff"" I am going to use a tapering method.

Years ago I had a big heroin addiction it lasted 20 years on and off. Withdraw was  3 maybe 4 days and you were done, yes more severe but after that three or four days you were done, none of this lingering bulshit. 

This stuff reminds me when I kicked methadone you have that initial 3/4 rough days but then the post withdraw could last two, three, four months. Never again for what you get on kratom it's not worth it.
Maybe it works for some and the withdrawal aren't as severe kudos to you. But if you are thinking about going in this direction and you're reading this beware and careful coming off could be no joke.",9

I mainly came on to see how much people used and what the wd looked like prob the same as a lot of you. Used for about a year and a half without anyone knowing. I woke up every morning with guilt, fear, shame and dread and insane anxiety. I have an awesome life but Kratom took my personality, humor and drive away from me. It made me angry at shit i shouldnt be angry at and thats really not in my personality. That was my main reason for quitting. I wasn't myself. It's a weird substance that way, and i've been through the ringer with most of em, this one is tricky thats for sure. I'm not against people using it as i know it's helped tons get off harder stuff (and it's really not my place to judge anyone for what they do), it's just time for me to dip as i wanna laugh and enjoy shit again. I took a trip away from everything to get through the first couple days by myself. It hasn't been too bad as i was only using towards the end 8-10g a day in like 1-2g increments and like 3 at bedtime. I tapered down a little bit before i decided to jump. Dont get me wrong, still sucks a lot but doesn't touch opiate wd. There are similarities like just that plain uncomfortable feeling all over that only a good drug addict knows. Sleep is super weird and fairly non-existent so i've been just reading all your stories which has helped a lot! I've been taking a couple gabapentins and some clonodine, but not much. Today i woke up feeling actually good. No dread, no fear and i mean... kinda excited to start life again. I still don't feel 100% but i definitely feel better. It's a hard thing to gauge, that's why kratom has been super tricky for me. Just wanted to check in, because i'm sure there are people here reading in somewhat of the same position i was in feeling pretty hopeless and wanted to share that getting off sucks, but losing your personality sucks a lot more, at least for me. Anyway, wish me luck as i have to go back to real life today. Hope you all have a good day and remember this weird ass feeling doesn't have to be forever.",13

I wanted to post an update on how my quit is going.

So here's what's taken place as an overall snapshot.

Week 1 - PURE SUCK

Week 2 - A LITTLE LESS SUCK BUT STILL SUCKY

Week 3 - A LOT MORE LESS SUCK

Week 4 - ACUTE PHASE OVER, BUT EMOTIONS CAME BACK IN FULL FORCE ALONG WITH CRAVINGS FOR ALCOHOL (173 DAYS ALCOHOL FREE)

Week 5 - NO CRAVINGS FOR ANYTHING THIS WEEK  :) 

I honestly don't know WTF is happening, but all I know is I am back to myself again!!  I feel like I am in the driver's seat of my life and the cravings for everything have dropped off.  I am shocked by how much I wanted to drink last week (this could've been due to it being Thanksgiving too), but all I know is since Monday I haven't had any cravings at all!!! Last weekend was really hard for some reason.  Oh, wait! That's right. It was my first weekend going out to bars/a Christmas party without drinking! Duh. LOL. Anyhow, that was HARD.  But this past week has been a breeze!!!  Hoping this is how it stays going forward!

Message me if you want support.  I'll give you my phone number and we can text.  

Congrats to all of you who have quit in the past 30 days!!  Just keep moving forward and it will get better.  I am proof!!! 

Much love!

Many people use it to tapper of kratom very easily and without WD. But can it be also used for cold turkey ? I think it should help much like DXM (synthetic NDMA Antagonist but ich i cannot recommend at all) Because what does it mean when it lower tolerance ? It means that it brings your neurotransmitter-systems back to balance! I totally forgot about agmatine and startet with 2g immediatly. I think it should shorten the timeframe till i am back to normal. Lets see i will report back everyday like the last few days.,6

Over the course of the last 6-8 months and especially during the last 3 months, i have gone from 4g red vein bali 3-5 times a day to upwards of 5g+ sometimes 6-8 times a day. I realized that I was chasing a buzz and this creeping depression has been because i have stopped making goals and started having a buzz be my goal each day. At work i dose 4.5-5.5g every 2ish hours, i work in the food industry so its hard to keep up when i start to feel the decline of effects after about that long. Not to mention I could REALLY use the money i spend on excess kratom on other things.

&#x200B;

SO my goal is this, before Christmas I want to be back down to 3.5g 3-4 times a day; and as of February I want to be down to kratom at work(way less than i use currently) and before bed only. After that I think the next step is by march to be down to almost baseline, perhaps 1-2G before bed. 

&#x200B;

 i started noticing how quickly time slips by and it would be nice to feel like days last more than a few hours lol

&#x200B;

I realized that I had begun to chase a buzz instead of actual accomplishments, no matter if it is beating a specific videogame or getting a specific amount of sleep, and all the enjoyment i was getting out of each day came from being on kratom, not actually LIVING. It will also certainly be nice to feel real emotions again and not just be at some level of numb throughout each day.

&#x200B;

Im also spending WAY too much money on it, and I could be using that to live much more easily and buy things that I enjoy that bring real enjoyment such as books, games, saving for a new pc ect. Right now I am working at a fast food place and all the money i would spend on those types fo things or just going out with friends or buying a meal out all goes to kratom. And that is really starting to upset me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Anyway, ive taken a look around this sub and it looks like a really supportive place for people trying to cut back and quit kratom, i know my story may seem like cheese compared to some of the people struggling with deeper levels of addiction but this is what im experiencing. Thank you guys for putting this place together and supporting people trying to quit the habit, ill catch you guys around!",17

Edit: Had no energy to go for more than 30 minutes for a walk... Anyway feeling a lot better now that i was out. We have so much snow suddenly, thats nice.

I didn't necessarily use every day, but on average I'd take 20 grams in one sitting after work, which would mean swallowing 40 friggin capsules at once with grapefruit juice to make it stronger, about 4-5x a week on average. On days I wasn't doing this, I'd just substitute getting drunk.

My emotions were fucked. I'd alternate from being zonked out high on k in front of the couch to being totally on edge where everything would annoy me and I'd be majorly depressed. It finally dawned on me that so much of the anxiety and depression was coming from not being high. 

I kidded myself a lot the past year. I've been using this shit very consistently and I always told myself ""Well, I'm not drinking as much"" or ""Well, I'm not doing hard drugs as much anymore."" Kratom is subtle, and that's what makes it tricky. I can't speak for it being made illegal because I'm sure it has helped some people, but it most assuredly never helped me. It only aided me in not dealing with life.

Whether I need to go stone cold sober or not is something I still have to figure out, but I can say with confidence that I'm never touching kratom again!

Hope all of you out there are doing well!",12

I won’t lie, the first ten days of this really sucked. Irritability, weird stomach pain, low energy. The last few days, however, I feel completely different. I’ve realized that all that time I was taking kratom everyday I was sacrificing my overall mood for a temporary burst of joy. 

Are there days that I would love a nice 3 gram cup of some green Malay before a five-mile hike? Hell yeah. But I’m starting to get the sense that if not used sparingly, kratom shouldn’t be used at all. 

Just after three weeks of abstaining, I feel more confident, happier and my sense of humor seems more upfront. Still not sleeping all that well, but hey, little victories. 

Just thought I’d share.",25

This night i again only slept 3-4 max. The anxiety in the morning is even worse now. Physical symptoms are almost gone now. I have no depression (yet?) just plain anxiety. For some reason even CBD doesnt help anymore with the anxiety.  I'm very exhausted from the last 10 days of more or less insomnia. I am weak. But going back is and was never an option. Luckily i go to georgia (not the state, the country) at the end of the year and kratom is illegal there. I'm there for 6 months, then india 6 months... So relapsing in georgia is impossible and after 6 months everything should be fine, i am looking forward to this day when i can sleep normally again. That will be a great accomplishment for me.

2019-12-11 23:00:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/e9ifp8/day_19_off_kratom/,Day 19 off Kratom,"Hey guys,

I haven't taken any kratom in 19 days. This is the longest I've been off it in over a year. I'm making this post because I've been feeling mentally weak these last few days. All the acutes are gone except for some off/on GI issues and randomly feeling hot/cold every few days. Sleep isn't perfect either, but its not holding me back. My anxiety was really bad last week, but this week has been getting better. What I've noticed this week is that depression has been setting in. While I've been doing better at work (better focus and connecting to coworkers on a deeper level), my home life is getting worse. 

When I get off work I have absolutely no energy or interest in doing anything. I haven'y been practicing playing my drum or reading like I usually do. I haven't been taking my dog for walks (the current rain streak certainly doesn't help). I've been half assing it at the gym (this is in part due to a very painful hemorrhoid due to diarrhea, but that's finally healing). This anhedonia is really taking a toll on me and I don't know how long I can tolerate it. I'm even too out of it to cook my own meals. When I get off work I just scroll reddit and watch netflix all evening. Fuck, I even purchased and installed a new video game, but haven't even played it. 

How do you guys stay busy when all you want to do is lay in bed?  I'm not getting cravings for kratom, but I am getting cravings for anything that will make this feeling go away. Alcohol pops up in my head a lot though I've been good at limiting it to 1 or 2 drinks a night. Weed pops up a lot too, though it usually gives me anxiety so I keep the dose pretty low or not at all most nights. I just drank some kava and its nice, but once the initial effect wears off then it leaves me with heightened anxiety. I vape a lot of CBD, but that really only helps with anxiety, not so much this weird malaise I've been feeling. 

I was supposed to go to a SMART Recovery meeting today, but I just couldn't bring myself to leave the house. Luckily I have a good life coach and therapist that I talk to regularly so my support system is decent. Anyways, just wanted to get this stuff out in the open and out of my mind. This sub has really given my strength to quit kratom. I really appreciate all the support you guys give. This sub has been more effective than any supplement or OTC drug at helping to relieve emotional pain from this withdrawal. It truly means a lot to know your'e not alone in this.

Thank you",5

Since I've started this god awful shit I have almost completely stopped working out, I eat less then half of what I used to. I used to be a gym rat and I want that back so badly. My ENTIRE day revolves around kratom, feeling satisfied for an hour and then thinking about my next dose. I'm burning through money like crazy buying 8oz every 2 weeks.

My plan is to use small amounts of alcohol and nicotine to help ease the withdrawal symptoms.

Tapered down to 4g once a day in the morning. Ive felt what its like trying to sleep and work without anything except natural supplements to help and its still hard. Trying to work in the morning is the hardest though. Thats why I only morning dose right now.

If I can use nicotine for the stimulation in the morning and the alcohol at night for reducing anxiety and to aid sleep.. i think that might help me a lot.

Thoughts?

P.s no im not going to get dependant on these 2 drugs. Im really not a fan of them and never use them otherwise. I look at them as a tool right now. Never been a smoker or a heavy drinker",2

I started using K 3 years ago to wean myself off  methadone after an injury at work. In total I’ve been a slave to one of these for nearly 5 years. 
I really felt proud of myself spending $150 dollars a week on K. I felt great that I’d beat my pill addiction, and I was convinced I could take kratom for the rest of my life. 
Then my wife left me at the beginning of this year. I was a hollow shell of the man that I used to be. I started to realize how far down is really gotten. I would come straight home and sit in my den all night ignoring my family, and see nothing wrong with it. 
I continued to take more and more kratom all the time to cope with losing her. Near my height I was taking 10 grams 6 times a day, and a few gram chasers in between doses if I started feeling tired.
It inevitably started taking a physical tole on my body. I lost a ton of weight and got down to 96 pounds. I started noticing trouble forming logical thoughts or sentences. I would just sit there blank minded, trying to form a coherent thought. 
I finally hit a breaking point this summer when I realized that I hadn’t left the house except for work since my wife left. All my friends were long gone, and I was all alone. 
The withdrawal from K has been so much worse than it was on methadone, but I’m starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel, and I feel like I can do this! 
In the past couple months I’ve tapered down to 20gpd, and I just switched to stem and vein this week which SUCKS. But I’m moving forward, slowly but surely.",33

I have been attributing my progress in quitting k with this mentality. Every time you say no to k you are making some sort of impact in your future sobriety. You may not have defeated it completely but you are one step closer to being the person that does to feed it completely. Let me give you an example. This time last week I was taking my normal amount of K and had the Epiphany quitting cold turkey is so painful that why don’t I just start saying no to it whenever I feel good. Which requires a ton of self-awareness. I’m excited to say that I have tapered so far down off of this garbage that I have had no physical withdrawals, I also started back my psych meds which have been really helpful. As of today I have had none and plan on going to bed tonight with none. My husband is holding my stash and that is making it harder for me to want to indulge. Last night I used one time for the whole day and I felt like a train had hit me afterwards which has also made me lose my affection for this.

2019-12-11 13:21:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/e9atxt/akathisia_for_searches/,Akathisia (for searches),"Akathisia is not uncommon in people withdrawing from opioids, benzos and barbiturates. It can start up to a few weeks from quitting and take weeks to months to end. I will give a list of helper drugs and then my experience for people who are also on a neuroleptic and have this problem.

Procyclidine
Benztropine
Amantadine

Clonidine - can also help with withdrawal

Propanolol

Benzodiazapenes

Mirtazapine or Trazodone in low doses

Viamin B6 in high doses

Akuamma Seeds or Powder

Antiviral drugs (only one source says this)

Many of these things have side effects and/or warnings. With prolonged higher doses the benzos and akuamma can have their own withdrawals when quitting, so I don't recommend that as a permanent fix.

Akathisia and RLS are different but have the same origin. Caused by low dopamine and possibly higher serotonin. Some people have said noradrenaline or norepinephrine may also play a part.

To me, RLS comes in waves. A strong temporary urge to move parts of the body. Akathisia is a constant urge to rock, sway, pace, squirm, etc and feels more like it's in the core of my body.

I started abilify 5mg in 2017 and immediately had a mild rocking. I lived with it a year because I liked its other effects. In 2018 I had a hypomanic episode where the akathisia stopped. However, I went up in mg of abilify to 15 and it increased physically and even emotionally. It also got worse with caffeine or stress. Worked my way down to 7.5 and it was gone again. Found kratom soon after that and the akathisia stayed gone - until I started doing higher doses and would get it in between doses.

I did a 2 week taper and after a week and a half the akathisia was unbearable. It was bad about 8 days.  During those 8 days here is how certain meds helped:

Propanolol 20 mg, 0-1 hour
Vitamin B, 1-2 hours (I have  multi vitamin b tablets that don't specify mg)
Klonopin .5 mg, 3-4 hours
Mirtazapine 15 mg, did not seem to help. My old psychiatrist said it generally works better at lower doses. I only heard of the akathisia connection yesterday so didn't try to change the dose.

On day 6 or so I saw my psychiatrist and got a script for clonidine. The rocking was much fainter by then. At point 2 mg a night it gets rid of the akathisia completely, but I get too many headrushes while moving around. Only a ton of coffee brings the rocking back for a while. After 3 days of clonidine I tried halving the dose to .1 a night and that doesn't do anything. Side effects are supposed to decrease with time so I will continue the .2 and see. (170 lbs, normal blood pressure)

From searches I found that a couple people have got this problem when starting certain antipsychotics/ antidepressants in the months after they quit kratom.

There are only rare instances of permanent akathisia, usually from an antipsychotic, that persists long after the medication is stopped.

Please feel free to add/ correct things and I will try to edit when I have time.",3

Here you will find out why you definetly should take the herb Hawthorn, when withdrawing from kratom! It really adresses the rout cause of the main withdraw symptoms!

I found something out that i must share with you! I researched what it is that creates this anxiety in the heart and we can't sleep when we withdraw from kratom. Simply said: It's excess noradrenalin which gets released because the effects of kratom are an repression of this stress hormone. Some of you may know this. This is why some take pretty dangerous beta blockers. What is the effect of those medications ? Simply said: They block of the heart from the effects of noradrenalin so it can't bind to the receptors. This way the anxiety will also go away. Now Beta Blockers are synthetic medication and have many down sides like they make depressive and more... they are even dangerous. What no one seems to know is that there is also a plant which can protect the heart from noradrenalin, also. Which plant ?

**Its called Hawthorn! I drank a tee from only 2g of Hawthorn and i already feel the releaving effects of this wonderful herb! its not gone completly, but the dosage was low. I will try like 6g this evening for sleep. This could be THE solution for all of you. And there is a saying: ""The best herb against sleepnessness ist a herb for the heart""**

Feel free to try this herb and report back in this thread! I would love to hear how you are doing with it!",11

Well not this time. I’ve just been trying to live my life normally instead of focusing on kratom throughout the day. Starting to feel more joy and reward for doing anything related to my hobbies so that’s good to see. Today is the 2 week mark since I started my AD meds. So I should start to notice a difference very soon with that. Yesterday I was out with my dad and grand dad doing some Christmas shopping for people and as we’re driving around town I noticed 2 different stores that had kratom advertised in their sign! Where I’m from that’s very unusual for a place to straight up advertise that they sell kratom. Made me more angry than tempted. It looks like this stuff popping up around me is gonna get worse before it gets better. It’s probably gonna take a large amount of people to die from kratom inflicted illnesses before they even have a chance at banning this stuff altogether. I feel for the people that are tricked into thinking this is a solution without consequences. I guess everyone has to learn somehow just like we did. Everything comes with a price. Either way I just wanted to let you guys know the progress and how day to day life was going. Everyday without kratom is another day of healing.,17

Normally (when sober), music moves me in crazy ways. I like all kinds of music and it typically brings out a lot of emotion, however, that is completely gone when I (heavily) dose Kratom. 

I always realize how important music is to me when I am clean. Its a high of its own to just feel real emotion that isn’t hidden beneath the green sludge barrier. 

Listening to old music that I used to love brings back nostalgic experiences from that timeframe - often accompanied by a few tears. I wish I could relive some of the life events I experienced while dosing so I could feel it all honestly. Everything just feels ‘meh’ while dosing...

There is a lot of negative effects caused by Kratom, but for some reason, this one bothers me the most. Maybe it’s because I finally can see that Kratom isn’t actually enriching my emotional state and in fact, is doing the complete opposite.

Sorry for the rant. I just feel like this is the best place to truly reflect on my experience without feeling judged.

Last Monday I told my husband that I was ready to quit. He brewed our kratom and was also a heavy k drinker. Not five minutes after I told him this, he texted to let me know everything was in the trash. The kratom, the percolator, everything. 

The first few days SUCKED HARD. I barely slept last week with how bad the restless leg was. But I kept telling myself that this was a battle; this was a fight for the life I want and I refused to stay down. That mentality helped me a lot. 

I had cravings but the WDs were worse. During the day I felt achy and like I had a mild flu; someone at work told me I “looked like hell” (he didn’t know) and asked if I was getting sick lol

But by Friday I was starting to feel okay again. And, the weirdest things started to happen. 

I couldn’t sleep for hours and hours that Saturday. I slept in til 10am, an unheard of awakening hour for two years, and enjoyed my day. Things felt more real. I felt like I had come out of this fog that I didn’t know I was in. 

As for the internal work, I suspect I was numbing myself. We are very close in my family. My cousins are like my siblings. (*TW: suicide*) The one closest in age to me, just a year younger, committed suicide two years ago and I guess without realizing it I was struggling with that hardcore. 

Today is day 8. I feel good. I feel NORMAL. Currently I’m having dips in energy and some unusual fatigue, probably because my body is adjusting to the lack of all-day energy boost (I was drinking only green strains). But I feel like I did two years ago, before the fog. I had a productive weekend. I feel HAPPY, not just satisfied and “whatever.” 

Thanks for this group. Thank you for sharing your stories and helping me confirm that I wasn’t going crazy, and that I could do this. That I could BEAT this.

2019-12-10 19:47:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/e8zmrk/suboxone_saved_me_recap/,Suboxone saved me + recap,"I posted something about using Suboxone to quit kratom about a week ago. Just to recap, I was taking about 60-70g of kratom daily for about a year. I was clean before that for almost a year, but prior to that I was using kratom for a chronic pain condition called pudendal neuropathy for about 3 years. My last addiction run was not pain related, but rather curiosity to be high without pain. And of course, it ended poorly.

I had decided to quit kratom awhile ago but had a really tough time quitting either cold turkey or tapering. I could never stick to a plan and CT was just too hard at that point. I decided to acquire some Suboxone. Some clinics will prescribe for kratom addiction, but others won't. I was lucky and found someone.

I won't lie. It was a complete life-saver to switch to Suboxone. My life on kratom was rock bottom. I lost a job, my relationship with the love of my life, family and friends suffered, I lost a ton of weight I couldn't afford and I woke up and went to bed in complete misery. I couldn't take enough kratom to ease the pain. But when I got ahold of Suboxone, this is how my taper went:

4mg in the morning + 2mg in the afternoon
For 3 days
Then 3mg + 2mg for three days
2mg + 2mg for three days
2mg + 1mg for three days
1mg + 1mg for three days
1mg for three days
0.50mg every other day for a few days

Mornings were the hardest but it was a breeze once the subs kicked in. You do get a slight mood boost for the first few days, but that goes away. At that point, I was used to not taking kratom and just feeling normal. Suboxone was a huge miracle in my path to sobriety. It literally took away almost all the pain and I recommend it to anyone who is ready to break off their addiction to kratom. I wish I could go back and time and do the same. I now have an amazing job as a materials science researcher. My relationship with my beautiful girlfriend is on fire. Sex life is better than ever. I started going to the gym again and playing guitar. I've got excess money for the holidays, traveling and coming up music festivals. I've started growing mushrooms again for therapeutic benefits. Life is fucking great and I have so much energy to do everything I couldn't do while on kratom. 

But enough banter. I hope this helps some of you out there running out of options. I've been at the bottom from this fucking plant and it's wasted plenty of my life. I suck with dealing with symptoms but Suboxone gave me a chance to be the person I was meant to be again. But as a disclaimer: Suboxone is physically addictive and should be treated with respect and that's why I provided my taper schedule. Be smart and don't chase that high. Trust me, it's long behind you",5

3 -4 months in I decided to do some more research and that's when I found the news of how addicting this stuff is. But it was too late. It has taken me 15 month to kick. The most my does was at the highest points was about 12 grams a day. Mostly I keep it around 6 to 8 grams a day total. It wasn't until a month ago I was experiencing pain on my right side. It became clear that when if I took 7-8 grams in the day the pain would come . That's when I had that light bulb moment that I need to quit and soon. So I started to taper myself off. Even as I lowed my dose to 3 grams a day there were still some days I would feel pain. 11 days ago with the help of some sleeping pills I quit over the weekend. That was 11 days ago. Even though the liver pain is gone for the most part I decided to get checked out. I got a blood test that came back normal. But also had an ultrasound on my liver and the results was that I have an enlarged liver now. My doctor has scheduled me for a CT scan now. I will post the results when I get them. I believe that kratom is to blame and of course myself. I did more research and found that there has been reports of liver problems but folks experiences these side effects within 10 to 14 days. Remember my situation was after 15 months.
The company I purchased from mostly in that 15 month is Mitra Gaia.
I don't know if anyone out there has experienced anything of what I'm going through or have any more information on this company who claims they are organic and test often. I say B.S to their claims.
It has been 11 days and not feeling 100 % don't know if it could still be withdrawals or did I do a number on my liver. Comments welcomed.",6

Please is anybody else going through this, because i'm lost and waiting on a long list for answers.  


History, I've been a kratom user for around 7 years, 2 stints of a 3 year and 2 year physical dependence, taking about 6g every 3 hours.  


When I used to take too much kratom when I was physically dependent, I would get hiccups and burping along with eye wobbles. When I stopped, I realized the sides under my ribs were swollen/there was a lump under my ribs with soreness and pain for a few weeks. I tried breathing into it to help the pain one night and had a seizure, cracked my nose. Hospital wasn't very helpful.  


I assumed it would go away seeing as I quit kratom in May. Now though, when I breathe there is a loud croak and pain coming from my side and it becomes difficult to breathe/I am constantly, constantly burping and still not absorbing any food? Also, when I  breathe deep into where I feel pressure around my diaphragm, I faint. One doctor said ""Oh, there's a bunch of air in your stomach, just stop swallowing air"" so i spit in a cup for a few days instead of swallowing anything to no avail. Other doctor just said ""That's odd."" when he felt the lump under my ribs, I had an ultrasound and it showed nothing interesting (however it doesn't show organs).  


Have you people had ulcers from kratom? That was my first suspicion here... I'm waiting on a family doctor but it's taking forever. Anybody suffering from anything similar? I have to go back to work soon, and feel physically run.",1

I did a quick taper down from 30-40gpd over 3.5-4 weeks and then finally jumped off 8 days ago. It has been a weird withdrawal. I only slept 1-3 hours for the first 4 nights but then I've slept 11-13 hours for the past 3 nights in a row. Despite taking Adderall for work (which I am prescribed) I have still been feeling exhausted and have had a hard time finding the motivation to focus or find the right words when typing emails or trying to explain my thoughts. 

Besides the sleep disturbances, the main physical symptoms are chills and a bit of a runny nose. Mentally, I had MAJOR depression last week when I wasn't getting any sleep (and I never get depression). I've been taking a host of vitamins and supplements for energy during the day and for sleeping. I've also been hitting the gym each work day for at least 45 minutes.

Today is the first morning I've woken up with a slight feeling of normalcy. This whole experience with Kratom has been odd. I've never felt a ""high"" so to speak from taking it, at most maybe a slight bump in energy and mood, yet there was something mental making me want to toss a cup of it back every couple of hours for the past 1.5-2 years now.

I am quitting Kratom because I've been feeling something missing from life for a while now. Call it joy, call it excitement, call it motivation. From a lot of what I have read on here, a lot of other users shared my feelings - so I am committed to quitting. Here's to hitting the 90-day mark.",6

I could write a book on my journey through this poison known as kratom, but I am going to make this simple- short and sweet as I can.

I have defeated this plant and I am not going back- no matter what. Just like my Prozac popping ex-girlfriend of 4 years. 

THIS IS IT! 

I am on day 7 and have had no withdrawals WHATSOEVER. (occasional waking up in the middle of the night, but went right back to bed)

I was so discusted with myself- letting this powder control my every move so I did something drastic to finally kick this shit to the curb.

As bas as I didn't WANT to do it? I purchased a benzo analog known as Etizolam. I took 4mgs the first day and two there after. No RLS- no withdrawals WHATSOEVER.

I am NOT advocating taking this route, but it worked for me.

I have a very important job and rehab was not in the cards- period.

I want to thank each and every last one of you who have been by my side throughout my failed attempts. It means more than any of you can imagine.

This medication has murdered any thoughts I had of kratom and ate the withdrawals for breakfast, lunch and dinner all in one serving. Take it as you will. I am happy to answer any and all questions from you guys and I'm sure I will get a lot of heat for addressing this method.

I love you all!

I've done this before so  it wasn't exactly new to me, but after being high in social situations again for almost 3 years straight, I knew trying to attempt going out again was going to be tough.  Here's a little about the technique:

>*An important step in managing anxiety involves facing feared situations, places or objects. It is normal to want to avoid the things you fear. However, avoidance prevents you from learning that the things you fear are not as dangerous as you think.*  
>  
>*The process of facing fears is called EXPOSURE. Exposure involves gradually and repeatedly going into feared situations until you feel less anxious. Exposure is not dangerous and will not make the fear worse. And after a while, your anxiety will naturally lessen.*  
>  
>*Here's a link on it:* [*https://www.anxietycanada.com/sites/default/files/FacingFears\_Exposure.pdf*](https://www.anxietycanada.com/sites/default/files/FacingFears_Exposure.pdf)

Anyhow, so my friend and I went out to a bar/restaurant Saturday night and another outdoor Village Christmas party last night.  Last night I had no idea of what to expect and I wasn't planning on it being this giant street party that it was.  I found a video from Annie Grace TNM about trying to go into social situations with curiosity rather than expectations as to whether or not it will be fun without drinking so that's what I did.  I ended up running into old friends I partied with and one even told me a story about how messed up I was the last time we hung out on edibles so that ended up actually being quite helpful and made me feel really good that I was sober this time when he saw me!  

I ended up meeting all these new people and we even went back to one of the girls houses for a bit.  I did feel rather stressed at times and a tad emotionally exhausted by the end of the night.  I ran 12 miles earlier that day.  BUT I did it.  As hard as it was at times dealing with all the urges/cravings to join in with everyone and grab a drink, I came home feeling really freaking proud of myself!!  I know the longer I keep doing this, the easier it will get.  Although it does maybe feel comparable to walking on a tightrope over a hot fire, I made it across.  Sometimes I can't believe I'm posting all this stuff and admitting it to anyone that will listen, but I feel like it's holding me accountable.  I hope that by sharing my experience I can help someone else.  

Happy Monday and may you all be blessed with the strength to overcome this battle one step at a time.  I pray it only gets easier for me and all of you!  I look forward to the day I can look back and laugh at my crying for alcohol and drugs in early recovery.

Much love!!",30

I've been reading a lot, reading through this subreddit really gave me some inspiration. 

One question I had was I had read some places online about Kratom causing Seizures as a part of the withdrawal synptoms, and honestly that has me pretty freaked out, I wanted to ask if anyone knows more about this particular topic and any advice you may offer. Not sure how bad the symptoms are going to be, but man I've gotta cut this crutch out of my life.",1

Long post.","Good evening everybody! It’s me again with the latest update of my life and I’d like to apologize because I said I’d update everyday and I just stopped. My reason for stopping was because I had some legal issues, my cousin got killed in my car (passenger), and now my fiancé’s sister got a subpoena to court to help build a case on me and my gang. I’ve commented here and there on other subs but this subreddit is actually fucking special to me and I don’t want to be fake with you guys. My fiancé is my rock but you guys are like my council. She doesn’t know how a withdrawal is but she has the patience of one million monk’s. Anyways, let’s get on with the summary of how my CT went. I’m on mobile btw so please forgive one brick of a paragraph. So remember how I said I’d refuse to go to the hospital because I want to kick Kratom like an average person? By average I mean a person without health insurance or a person who can’t afford a doctor. I had to go to the hospital because by day 8 I did not poop and I was bloated to hell with what felt like I swallowed razor blades. It turns out I was becoming “septic”. Yes, my poop was literally killing me. They asked me if I was doing heroin or opioids, I said no but I’m kicking Kratom. They then proceeded to research what Kratom was (the doctor had no clue). They then said “So you’re withdrawing from heroin? We can’t help you if you’re not honest with us.” I told them again I’m not on Heroin or opioids but they didn’t believe me because the fucking google search article said Kratom is for recovering heroin addicts. At this point I’m like Fuck you and your entire staff bitch! I’m leaving to another hospital. They then brought me a new doctor who surprisingly had knowledge of Kratom. He even admitted he uses Kratom to me! He told me that I shouldn’t do more then 6 grams in a week and to only use two days out of the week to avoid constipation. I told him, no fuck Kratom you can keep it I’m fucking done using it. Anyways, they gave me a white pill to calm down (Ativan) which btw did nothing for me because I used to take Xanax and Kpins like fucking candy, but I appreciated the gesture. He then cleared me to go to the imaging station. So after they x-rayed me, they gave me some weird shit to drink, it was fizzy and tasted like the devil’s shit that was shitted out by each dragon in Skyrim. The doctor told me to wait so I did and I burpped so much but after 30 minutes he was concerned because I had no urge to poop. So they gave me 2 more separate drinks and still nothing. The drinks just made me more nauseous and bloated, like a condom trying to contain the entire Atlantic Ocean bloated! He then told me I might have to do an Enema or even a possible surgery. I said FUCK NO because I don’t want anything going in my ass and the last time I had surgery I got addicted to Opioids and had a catheter (idk how to spell) that shit that goes in your dick and takes your piss and puts it in a bag, that thingy. Anyways, about an hour goes by and I’m in absolute PAIN and the most glorious feeling comes rumbling in my stomach and it was LOUD  like Zeus and Jesus dropped some molly and decided to have a rave in my intestines! I’ll skit the details but my god did I feel better! Moral of the fucking story, when the majority of people tell you to go to the doctor or a hospital on this sub, FUCKING GO! You guys literally saved my life. I’m in a dark place in my life right now but thank you all for helping me and in return I shall help you all too. Or at least try to help. To all my civilians that are kicking Kratom, you can do it but please PLEASE please go to the fucking hospital when you haven’t pooped in over 4 days. I’m stupid so I waited 8 days (it can actually kill you). To all of the real gang members on this thread, cut this Kratom shit out before I get you DP’d (jk cuzzin) but seriously please stop it this shit ain’t cool. I turned so many other people to Kratom because i thought of it as a “Pro-Drug”. Nigga the only thing Pro about it is how It can professionally block your poop up until you become septic! The doctor said I was lucky and I believe it. I’m mourning my nephew, I’m mourning Juice WRLD (RIP) never met him but I rap and do shows too and I would have LOVED to be in the studio with him. Shit I proposed to my fiancé while his song Black & White was playing at Olive Garden (I knew the owner of the building so they agreed to play Juice WRLD) he was my girl’s favorite artist and my last OD I was listening to his songs, my fucking cousin got killed 2 weeks ago in my passenger seat while I was driving and he was wearing a Juice WRLD 9th Eye Blue Flannel I bought him for his birthday. I’m fucking rambling now, sorry guys I’m a fucking wreck and I really want to get high and black out drunk but I can’t break my girl’s heart. Don’t make promises you can’t keep like “I’ll never do drugs again”. I already suffer from depression and I might be getting indicted, if I do get arrested and found guilty then they’ll definitely put Gang enhancements on me. Anyways, Day 26 I no longer have any WD and I can poop regularly. Thanks for letting me vent. You guys are really healthy for me and so many others. Be safe and watch your back guys. The Holidays are usually REALY GOOD or BAD, at least in my life it is. Thanks again guys.",8

I had actually forgotten what it felt like to feel so alive!  I didn't even realize how dead I was while on kratom.  I lied and told myself it added to my life - BS! 

All day was a glorious day mentally/emotionally and that was on NO sleep. Music was entirely AHMAYZING.  

Unfortunately, at around 48 hours my intestinal issues were so painful and persistent that I HAD to take a tiny spoonful(scant tsp), but I REALLY didn't want to. Even after I made the tea I stood there with my stomach cramping talking myself in and out of it for about an hour before I finally gave in. 

 If it wasn't for the various and intense pains(and other issues,) I would have been just peachy. 

  Tomorrow I will be stopping by the drug store first thing to take care of that and then it's GAME ON.   

I can't wait.  Anyone worried about making the jump, I encourage you to get some music that helps you transcend, get some Imodium to keep your nervous system in check(don't underestimate the impact k had on your digestion like I did) and go for it! 

Life is so good when you can FEEL it!

2019-12-08 21:55:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/e83vk9/to_quit_or_notmy_kratom_dilemma/,To quit or not...my Kratom dilemma,"I will be posting flow of thought, mostly because it pains me to make this post, but I really need to talk about it. I'm 45yo and very physically fit and active. I began using Kratom 3-4 years ago. I started taking it to get off of using Tramadol, something I did daily for 2-3 years prior to that. I was looking for a way to get off tramadol and found out about Kratom in a forum like this. My first dose of Kratom and I was so glad that it worked to get me to never touch another tramadol again. However, it was presented at the time that Kratom was not addictive and didn't have negative withdrawal effects. I think this is more widely known to be completely false. In fact, I've experienced some withdrawal effects from Kratom, I know it's true.  


Kratom is difficult for me to quit because it has so many positives. It lifts my mood, gives me energy and cures my insomnia.   


Negatives are depression, (I know, weird it can make he high and depressed at the same time...highs then lows) dulled thinking and detachment.  Kratom definitely makes me dumb, but I'm an intelligent person and just see it as giving IQ points for feeling good....(sometimes) It also has changed what I enjoy and dislike in life. I find myself reading about things I'd never care about if I was sober and not on Kratom. I also know that I don't feel music like I used to sober. I guess it has changed parts of me as a person, and my only interest in getting off of it is to feel like myself again. (even if that's more angry but strong) Kratom has been shown to drop testosterone levels so that's another reason to quit.....but I get along with my Wife great, and am scared for her to see the angry, sober me. I probably use this shit to mask some pain that I picked up along this journey of life. I honestly can't pinpoint what it is, I developed a coping mechanism at a young age of blocking trauma out as a way to deal with it. Another big negative from my Kratom use is it makes me very anti-social. I've lost my social ""radar"" so to speak, where I had clarity where everyone else is at mentally. (I'm too in my own head for that enlightenment on kratom, that's the detachment I speak of)  


So, I want to get back to feeling myself....but I'm terrified of withdrawals, feeling like total shit, depression and insomnia. I know that's what quitting will get me. I'm great financially and with my family, so that's not a problem. I guess in life everything comes at a cost. You can't have the positives of kratom without negative effects. Big respect to those of you who have quit and stayed clean. God bless you. BTW, I'm currently a 30-40 GPD user. I know I'd have to taper for a long time before stopping. Fuck, I HATE the depression that will give me. That is why it's so difficult for me to quit. Minimal benefits, many negatives.",5

My thoughts are more shallow than they used to be, and I struggle to find good words to express myself. I experience brain fog, especially in the early morning, and when I try to quit. 

I'm worried that Kratom has impaired my cognitive abilities, and after doing research, I've noticed that other people have the same problem. I'm really hoping I have not permanently damaged my mind with this habit (10-12 grams per day; used for less than 2 years. I went through intermittent bouts of heavy alcohol usage for a year, and used Kratom to come off of it).

If you noticed this while you were on Kratom, did things normalize after you quit? If you can, please give me some hope because I'm a little freaked out. Thanks!",8

Even before the taper my sleep has been completely wrecked. I take a melatonin, valerian root, and trazadone, and I still can’t fall asleep for hours and hours after I go to bed. 

I’m thinking of using a small dose for sleep to get my sleep schedule back on track. I’m thinking like 500 mgs before bed. And I’d use sparingly as needed, and only while tapering. I’ve been down the phenibut rabbit hole before so I know it must be treated with respect. Addiction to it is not fun. But I can’t get any thing else for sleep (clonadine, benzo) so I figured this would be the next best thing. 

Anyone else tried this or have any tips?",4
2019-12-08 19:44:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/e82bfz/kratom_is_nonaddictive_my_ass/,Kratom is non-addictive MY ASS,"So basically I used methadone to get off of street opiates that I was addicted to but then I was extremely dependent on methadone for several years. My metabolism was so fast that I would wake up every morning having pretty severe withdrawals and so I decided to taper off of it. The taper was pretty challenging so I decided to use Kratom to help assist me in a fast taper to just get it over with as I’ve heard that Kratom is non addictive. When I finally got to 0mg of methadone I decided to up my usage of Kratom and I admit I think I overused it a little bit due to how it made me feel, but it also helped significantly with the withdrawals.

Fast forward several months later and I’m extremely dependent on Kratom. I take around 2 and 1/2 to 3 teaspoons of Kratom 3-4 times per day and a few hours after each dose I start to feel pretty shitty. Luckily I’m not AS dependent as I used to be because I was using it every hour or so for awhile and if stopped for a few hours my eyes would water and Ide start yawning and getting anxious and lethargic and extremely irritated. One day I decided to quit cold turkey and I was just gonna stop, i went to the doctor and they prescribed some meds that were supposed to help. The last time I had dosed was 2 am and the next day I went all day without Kratom and around 2 pm started to really get unwell. I was feeling like complete shit and couldn’t get comfortable no matter what and the meds were barely helping. This horrible feeling in my body just built up more and more all day. That night I was hanging on by a thread, I just wanted to take Kratom so fucking bad because I knew it would stop the suffering I was going through. I was rolling around on my bed sweating and shaking and thrashing around. I made it exactly 24 hours before I cracked. It was 2 am and I had THE WORST restless leg syndrome I’ve ever had in my life. I couldn’t sit still for more than a second and if I tried to suppress the restlessness my legs would flail into the air uncontrollably. I was pacing around the house dancing around like I was having a panic attack, and there was absolutely no way I would get even a wink of sleep even with the meds and it was only getting worst and worst. The suffering was unbearable so I made some Kratom tea and finally was able to lay still and fall asleep. The next morning I decided I wasn’t gonna quit cold turkey and at least taper a little bit to try to lessen the severity for the jump off. Getting off this shit is really challenging and it’s kind of ruining my life. I feel like I’m bipolar because as soon as my dose kicks in I feel really good and functional and as soon as it starts to wear off I feel extremely irritable and frustrated/anxious and unhappy. I’m just trying to space my doses out until I can just take it once or twice per day and then try jumping off then. I’ve also been slightly lowering the dose of my 3-4 doses per day but sometimes after lowering it I’m unable to sleep and have to go back up again. I also have a job that involves animals and I can’t put them at risk by not being on top of my shit, I work at a doggy daycare and I’m a professional dog hiker as well. A week ago during my taper I felt really out of it and a dog slipped his harness and ran and almost got hit by a car and I cant help but think maybe I put the harness on wrong or something but it was a shitty harness. Luckily the dogs okay But it scared the shit out of me and made me realize how important being in a clear head at my work is. So i basically feel trapped and at times suicidal because of this dependency and it’s definitely lowering my quality of life. Not sure what to do...but I’m gonna keep trying because I just want to be liberated from all dependencies even Kratom although I’m grateful to be off methadone and any other opiates.",39

I can now happily report that I'm no longer constipated and I can make noises with my butt again.

Time marches forward. Much of this is distracting yourself while time serves you by allowing you to heal and rebuild. All you need is time without. The more days you get, the easier it gets, eventually you dont think about kratom anymore.

Used Kratom for 6 years, but this last year my use just got stupid. Probably 50-70g a day. So I decided to kick it. Went through some intense acutes over thanksgiving week. Basically went 4 days no sleep. Last night I finally got a full nights sleep. I woke up today with an overwhelming feeling of victory. This thing I thought was so hard and I would never be strong enough to do is, for the most part, behind me now. It was hell but it is soooo doable. I learned a few things that helped me.

I realized attempting to take anything other then supplements to help sleep only made RLS worse for me. I would recommend staying away from any meds even when you get desperate after not sleeping for a few days.

I kept a very small number of caps with my wife. On the really bad nights I would ask for a tiny dose to lessen the withdrawals enough to sleep for a couple of hours. If you have self control issues I wouldn’t recommend this. Also, I found that eventually I had to pay the piper but getting a little sleep in the beginning helped ease me into it.

I took thanksgiving week off work and made sure I had plans with friends. If you had a long and crazy habit like me, the first week is hell. Just plan a few days where you can be off work but still have something to do. Sitting at home is the worst thing to do, even though it feels like that is all you can do. Keep moving! Even if you are just walking around your house.

You won’t feel like going to the gym but with the right preworkout supplement you can do it. I actually got in shape before quitting and that helped so much.

Anyways, the real point of this is my mind made this out to be so much harder then it was. If you decide you need to quit, it is hell, but you get through it and feel so much better, in a surprisingly short time. Thanks again to everyone sharing their stories here. It helped soooo much!",12

The biggest issue I've had throughout this process is stomach irritability.  Sleep, instead of 8-9hrs normally I got 5-6hrs.  Last night I finally got back to at least 8.     


I remember throughout the last 2 years I'd start yawning a lot and sneezing when it was time for a dose, or right after a dose for some reason.   So I figured I'd be sneezing and yawning a LOT.   While I've had a few sneezes, and yawns, but not as much as I thought.  


No RLS, been toking the weed at night for sleep + benzos, exercising every morning on our new Peloton spin bike, and generally eating well.

I still have a brand new bottle of K that I bought last Saturday, just in case... There's been times during the week a brief thought of ""grab a few"" but I didn't.  So cravings were not that strong, will probably be throwing out that bottle today.

Now.. I'm wondering how long I should wait before starting to tackle the remainder of my addictions.  I've taken up vaping as of 2 years ago and have been taking 20MG-40MG of Valium daily for a year.     I'm thinking of just cutting the vaping right now.   Earlier this year I went on vacation and went nicotine free for 8 days.   I didn't have any issues, but I was also on K so that might have helped.    Then on to tapering off benzos which I've done before and should be a blast!  One thing I've learned about myself is I just can't do anything one time lol.

The weekdays were easy - I had work to distract me. Friday was really hard because I'm used to ""rewarding"" myself with Kratom, and sometimes taking more on Friday night. I would always have a few capsules in my pocket when going out Friday night just ""in case"" I got sick and ""needed"" them. I definitely had strong cravings on Friday, but didn't take any with me and got through it. I was pretty uncomfortable and couldn't stop yawning when I was out  but had a good time anyways.

Today was challenging. I keep thinking I'm going to wake up feeling better but I still feel a little crappy - yawning, restless legs, not wanting to do much, cravings. Day 1 and 2 were pretty easy compared to how I'm feeling now. I was definitely shocked that my withdrawals got pretty bad by day 3, but I didn't give in. I don't want to go back to Kratom - I've gotten this far already. 

Sleep has been OK - takes me a while to fall asleep. Before I would lay down and pass out immediately. However, I would wake up sick and have to dose in the middle of the night sometimes. It sure is nice not to have to worry about dosing and hiding my doses now. That's the best part. Surprisingly my anxiety is a lot better than when on K. I have anxiety in general, but it's a lot better. I can look people in the eye now when I talk. I don't feel the shame and guilt 24/7 like I did on Kratom. I went to the casino and the mall earlier and wasn't feeling like everyone was staring at me, like I do when I'm on Kratom. Hopefully it gets easier in a few days but I'm not giving up! Good luck to everyone on this fine weekend. I can't wait for the acutes to stop. Feels like the longest 96 hours of my life.",2

I know a lot of people want to know this so my usage was 10.75 years daily, 10-15gpd average (5-7.5g twice a day), no extracts, no other drugs other than weed in the last 1-2 years.

Skipping the life story... which just isnt very interesting... I began tapering this summer to try to actually quit, and it took me 4 months to go from 6.5gpd to zero. Even during that super slow taper it affected my mental state, which I really needed to keep under control for job reasons. This shit is not easy.

I'm now at day 47 and looking back on it, the first month was easier than my last two weeks. You may have seen posts from me that sounded like I was doing alright. I thought I was. I was at 95% but now its like 50%. It really seems like PAWS has slammed on the accelerator pedal, hurling me into a week+ long episode. I really dont get it... why is it getting *harder*? The cravings are no big deal to me. I have kratom right here but I dont want it. I want to recover... and man is it frustrating when it only seems to get worse!

I dont know if this is normal but after day 30 I noticed I occasionally have RLS, yawning, sweating/hot flashes and body aches. Clenching my fists, feet and jaw at times. Sex drive disappears during these episodes too, it is shocking how fast that can come and go. Is this all to be expected 45+ days out from a super slow taper? I expected it to be mostly mental at this stage.

I only ever feel normal after smoking a bit of weed. Maybe I need to stop that too, but I smoke very small amounts of it. It takes me like 2-3 months to go through a few grams, and its the only break I get from this war that never seems to end.

I am taking vitamin B2/6/12 complex sublingual liquid, omega 3-6-9, vitamin D with coconut oil, vitamin E, vitamin C, and have a cup of black or green tea a few times a week. I also started taking small amounts of ALCAR on the weekends only... not sure about this one... It sounds kind of promising but I'm also wary of it.

I dont regret quitting despite this bullshit. I am glad I am doing it, its a dumb habit.

Thanks for reading everyone... I hope some of you are seeing the light. Stay strong and dont let your guard down! I thought I was in the clear, but no....",6

I CTd two Fridays ago. It's been a ride. A week ago I came down with a super cold. Not quite a flu but close. I'm still recovering from it lol. I'll admit the past 15 days have gone by pretty fast. I've had a couple of very close calls but held tight. I'm feeling decent actually with some lows fast balled at me from time to time. My main issue is im still quite weak but the cold I'm sure isn't helping that. I'm still experiencing some rls in the evening but nowhere near as bad as it was, just annoying more than anything. If I could just get my energy back up I'd feel pretty good. Sex drive is starting to kick in 😉Mentally I'm definitely not 100%, maybe 70% give or take but I'm confident another week or two will help a lot. One thing is for certain, I am 100% glad I gave up this garbage when I did. Even though the boredom is grinding at some times, it's so much better than shoveling ounce after ounce of raw plant down my gullet 9 times a day, day after day. I'm not myself yet, but I am free!

It pisses me off more than anything that all this is happening between the dog passing, my uncle passing and my wife’s grandmother passing.

I tried to quit but had complications caused by acute liver and renal injury caused by taking kratom while I had a UTI/kidney infection that I didn't know about. I'm happy to say i've tapered to nothing over the past few weeks, and have been off of it entirely for 2 weeks and 2 days now. The withdrawal was easier than I expected in some ways, and worse in others. It peaked in the first 24 hours, and by day 3 I felt almost normal during the day. By day 5, completely normal during the day. But the issue now is a strange one. I don't know if this is paws, I've quit hard opiates before and didn't experience paws. With a longer habit and insane dosages, too. But right now, i'm two weeks completely sober and while the acute symptoms are almost entirely gone, at night I still get restless legs. This isn't that huge of a deal, I can usually manage to sleep anyway right now. The main issue is that I still have diarrhea all the time, despite having no other symptoms left over. I thought it might be related to the renal issues, but the doctors have told me they can't figure it out, but it's most likely just the withdrawal. The reason this is a concern is that I go back to work on monday, and i'm fire/water damage technician, which means 90% of the time there is no bathroom available on site at the jobs I go to. Shit's getting tight financially, so if anyone has had persistent diarrhea after the withdrawal, it would help immensely if you could tell me what your timeline was like for that to go away.   


Also, I know about immodium, I can't take it. Doctors advised I shouldn't take anything really because of the kidney issues this all caused. Dietary changes aren't doing anything either. On the positive side, I feel the best i've felt in years and music sounds so good it can move me to tears. Sex drive came back as well. Now if I could just stop pooping 24/7 things would be great.",8

The worst of the ""acutes"" were mostly over by the end of day 4, but there was plenty of suffering to come. It hasn't been bad. Cravings for a couple days, extreme lethargy, depression, lack of caring about anything, rls intensified 10-fold by having to take NyQuil for a bad chest cold. When I stopped the NyQuil, the rls became easily manageable. But Sleep, this, this is by far the worst symptom. Haven't had more than 2 hours per night in those 12 days. 2 nights I only got 40 minutes. I would say 90 minutes of sleep is what I get on average. It's killing me.

By day 5 or 6, most of the symptoms were abating. But they also seemed to morph. The depression turned to apathy. The  lethargy turned to tiredness, the lack of caring became caring but just not enough. Rls became skin that just wouldn't be comfortable.

Eating isn't a problem but nor is it fun, really. The body is working fine in all departments to the best of my recollections. My vaping, about 120 mls a week (box mod) while on K, has gone down dramatically. I'm vaping at most a quarter of what I was. Probably less.

SO, I would be golden if it weren't for the horrendous inability to sleep. I was so shocked with how quickly the acutes went by that I was almost pissed. Like wtf did I get myself so worked up over? Well, maybe it was the long, slow taper. But even then, I jumped at between 7-11 gpd over the last month of my taper. I had no intention of jumping. I woke up at 6:30 one morning and was 4 hours away from having 24 hours CT. And Thanksgiving was 3 days away! So I jumped on a whim.

Now I'm rambling. Sorry. Blessings to all. I wouldn't mind hearing what has been done to get some sleep. Don't bother mentioning prescriptions cuz I won't go there. Don't mention shit like melatonin, St. Johns, or chamomile because they have had no effect. How about just how long it took to get a little sleep. That would be helpful. A little hope is all I need. Thanks all.

EDIT: I should add my high was 30-40 gpd for a couple months but not many 40's. Mostly in the high 20s gpd for another 6 months during a 14 month stint on K.",6

around this time my kratom use amplified again. fast forward 2 months and ive added daily marijuana use to replace the harder substances. 
kratom has begun giving me some weird heart issues so i went from my average (roughly 20gpd) to around 12gpd the next day and 4 grams the next. the withdrawals started when i dropped to 12gpd and got exponentially worse on day 2. the first day with zero kratom i used an extrenely small dose of suboxone which took them away almost completely for the first half of the day. Today it was extremely unpleasant up until about halfway through the day. It seemed yo subside somewhat after i took my second 250mg phenibut capsule with two 25mg cbd gummies. 

i don't know if there is much correlation because ive been taking phenibut everyday. i started my taper at 2.5 grams per day and have slowly dropped down to 1 gram per day with no issues at all. in fact i feel the subtle anxiety reduction of phenibut more without kratom. i feel less anxiety in general with no kratom

the symptoms are like that of opioid withdrawal but much lighter. of coursr opioid withdrawals are hell and EXTREME this withdrawal is milder but fucking weird. i feel almost delirious and confused. the mental effects are completely different and strangely not all negative. the cravings are there but i feel more desire for actual opioids than kratom. 

the rls and soreness and muscle twitching and spasms are the worst part. the odd brainfog/near delirium that i expireince at times is also very strange, oddly enough reminding me more of phenibut and gabapentin withdrawal

this is weird. i feel phsycially shitty and sore and uncomfortable but mentally fine. feel more confident and less stupid. 

is this just kratom withdrawal being short or is the phenibut and cbd actually helping me here? also would it be a bad idea to use suboxone any more for this? is it possible to take extremely low doses for a couple days (once a day only) for the worst of the acutes and stop without becoming hooked on buprenorphine instead?

also im a former opioid and gabapentin addict. i took methadoneand  hydrocodone together in moderatly high doses for a long time Nd tried to maintain with loperamide for 6 months after i lost access to the good stuff. those withdrawals were fucking HELL and it lasted like 2 months before i didnt feel sore and restless constantly so i have expirience with opioid withdrawal, but kratom withdrawal is weirdly different. alot more tremors and involuntary twitching. but not as bad as traditional opioids. it almost feels like a different type of withdrawal altogether. 

sorry if this is completely unorganized. my brain is in a hell of a fog right now lol",1

The withdrawal felt the most intense when I lowered my dose from 15 to  9 GPD, and it’s only gotten easier. Before tapering, if I missed a dose I would be awake at 3am with restless leg, cold sweats, and an overall “panicky” feeling. 

I’ve kept the taper pretty consistent, meaning I haven’t missed a dose in 2 months, so I’m not sure how the withdrawal from 15GPD would compare to 4.5. 

If I decided to CT right now would I feel any significant withdrawal? I’m fairly sensitive to Kratom withdrawal so I wanted to cut my dose down to .75GPD before going CT, but would it even make a difference at this point? 

I’ve been taking 1.5G doses at 6am, 5pm, then 10pm for the past week and only felt inter-dose w/d for the first few days. Last night I forgot to take my 10pm dose, and didn’t remember until my legs felt a little restless around 12.

I just wanted to chime in here briefly, and mention my experience thus far. 

So I had been using Kratom for about a year and a half before it really started taking its toll. Wasn't feeling motivated, no sex drive, had to always carry enough with me and sneak off to dose in bathrooms and such at family gatherings. Probably around 50 gpd.

Anyways, I used the last of my powder last Sunday and told my wife that evening. 

Had about 4 days of feeling like shit, sleeping on the couch, too lethargic to even play with my daughter. Well today is day five and I'm feeling very good and strong. Finally feel like myself, someone I kind of lost track of for a while there.

I’m currently on antibiotics for the UTI. I should add that I’ve had a couple blood tests done just a couple months ago and everything was perfect. I’m relatively healthy, eat well and exercise as much as I can, BM everyday (sorry TMI). I’ve just gone downhill fast...I’m a Mother like so many here, 3 girls and I’m going to school full-time. I’m tapering down and have a plan for that, and support. However, I’m considering just CT’ing because of the scary and recent symptoms.

I suffered alone through the first 10 days. Didn't tell anyone, I was out of town visiting friends and just said I had the flu so I didn't do much.  It was hell.  I've quit before and stayed clean for almost 2 years but somehow it brought me back and I used it again for another year and a half.  The acutes were much worse this time.  

My biggest worry was my girlfriend finding out.  I didn't plan on telling anyone about this. But when I came home she knew something was wrong.  I told it her was anxiety.  I just kept lying but she knew something was up.  She asked me if I'm hiding anything and I lied straight to her face.  Couldn't sleep much that night and felt the worse I have yet because of the guilt.  I decided to come clean and told her everything. And it was fine.  It's much better than trying to hide something.  I feel so much more free now.  She's been so supportive and helpful.  

One thing that has helped TREMENDOUSLY since I discovered it is Wim Hof breathing.  The first time I did it, around day 8, I instantly felt better for a couple hours.  Anytime I started feeling low again, I'd do it again. It's seriously a gift and like a small reset button.  My mental state has been great.  I still don't feel quite myself nor can I sleep very well but I feel happy.  Especially to be unshackled by that green chain.  Happy quitting everyone.",15

I knew I'd have very little $ left for myself until payday next Thursday, but I started thinking - I think this is a great opportunity for me to finally jump. Especially being as I have no choice!

I was ""tapering"" for the passed two weeks; I went from 3 OPMS extract shots a day for a few months, then finally moved down to 1 OPMS shot a day for the passed two weeks. I bought a pack of powdered Kratom to help with that (if I only use powder, I go through a 1oz back each week). However, this time I'll have literally no money to buy either OPMS OR powdered Kratom. I'm hoping that 5 days with 0 Kratom at all will put me over the hump and allow myself to not purchase any on payday next Thursday. My biggest fear is operating at work while going through this. I do NOT want to lose my job.

That some guys here managed to quit cold turkey a 150g/ day kratom habit is spectacular. I'm from Germany and now on day 4 of quitting a 8 year (with breakes) kratom habit ranging from 65g and then tapper down to 45g and then quit. I quitted from 65g/ day in the past and it was hell the first days where the adrenaline pumps through your veins, gives you crippling anxiety and sleeplessness for many days if not weeks and slowly drains your energy reserves. Then it leaves your pretty burned out and depressive afterwards. Its the adrenaline whats the problem. Thats why some guys take betablockers to totally block the effects of adrenaline on the heart. They say it almost completely prevents withdrawal. I didnt do betablockers what i do is the following.

\- Vaping Eliquid with high CBD content as soon as the anxiety goes overboard (really takes the edges off big time)

\- 500mg Phenibut the first 4 days on 4PM. So it starts to work at 8-9PM and you may be able to sleep some hours

\- 30-40g Instant Kava Kava - The most sedating strain you possibly can find that at the same time doesnt stimulate.Go to a good kava kava seller and ask them. I contrary to Germany you have them everywhere! Here in Germany itsREALLY difficult to get good kava kava - It really helps! Try it!

\- Buy the device: ""SOTA Bio-Tuner BT6"" on the internet. I know its not cheap but this little device pushes out frequencies to your brain to instantly jump start endorphin production again. Shure the normal endorphin will not be enough to prevent the withdrawal but it will make it much more bearable. The missing Endorphin Production is the cause for PAWS. With this little machine and CBD you will not make PAWS i promise!

\- L-Theanin made from Green Tea. This is a substance that relaxes. The effect is not strong but in combination with the other stuff its just a little extra relaxation which you want as much as you can get it, right ?

\- Black Seed oil for after acute withdrawal. This oil is used in afghanistan for heroin addicts. It somehow interacts with the opioid receptors without making you high or anything like that. It just gives you some balance.

\- A good Passionflower supplement with high quality extracts. This you can use for the next few weeks just to make you sleepy at night.

If i only could choose one supplements i think it would be CBD. Recently there was a study which could show that CBD prevents relapses and pretty much works on exactly those symptoms like anxiety, RLS etc. etc. of opioid withdrawal!So buy 10g pure CBD, mix it with some VG and 40% PG (or 20% alcohol - its not much so no problem)

&#x200B;

Some things that also helped me to deal with the symptoms:

\- Go for a quick (or long) walk in the woods

\- Take a hot shower if you cant bare the symptoms anymore. Stay there as long as you want and if that means you shower for 30 minutes.

\- Go to a swimming pool with hot salt water. As long as you are in hot water you will feel much better. Its warmth that is missing. You got the warmth of kratom, now supplement with other heat sources.

\- Another heat source is the hot water bottle. It will take the edge of your symptoms as well and will make you a little more relaxed. Vape some CBD along with it. pretty much chainvape CBD all the time. I do every hour if not more. Dont forget to drink... the best ist just hot, coked water... because vaping will steal water from your body when you vape!

&#x200B;

Still the withdrawal is there and you CANT prevent it. YOU WILL GET SICK! But you definetly CAN take the edge off. Last time my anxiety and the RLS was so bad i almost freaked out. This time is much better. I dont know if its because i ""only"" quitted a 45g/ day habit, or if its because of the supplements. Still the anxiety is there strongly but i dont let it get to bad. The best thing is i didnt get depressive yet. I hope it will be the same when i discontinue with the phenibut. Phenibut really helps but you cant take it longer than lets say 3-4 days. Also keep the dosage down. 500mg will be enough for most people!

&#x200B;

If you can its much better to make a slow taper... This way you can prevent PAWS altogether. PAWS comes from the shock the body must go through when qitting cold turkey. If you quit cold turkey make shure to get CBD, kava kava, SOTA Bio-Tuner BT6 device and phenibut.

&#x200B;

I'm on day 4 at its still as bad as yesterday. I hope it will get better in the next days! The fact that i still have roughly 1KG Kratom two meters away from me and i managed to not take it for several days tells me that this isnt really an addiction. Addiction is when you have compulsive behaviour. When you have cravings that bad that you would do anything to get rid of it... so you take the drug of your choice again. The only thing that really sucks is that overflow of adrenaline which slowly burns you out and doesnt let you sleep. When will this adrenaline peak end ? I dont know but i let you know how it will develope!

AT ALL THAT WANT TO QUIT KRATOM: JUST DO IT BUT PREPARE WELL! IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO TO TAKE THE EDGE OFF IT WILL BE MUCH BETTER!

&#x200B;

\*\*\* UPDATE DAY 6 \*\*\*

Hi! I just want to report back how i feel and do. This i 5AM. I'm awake since 3AM but i think i had sleep for rougly 5 hours tonight, which is great. But only with the help of CBD and MUCH kava kava to really knock me out. Still the adrenaline can always be felt, even with CBD and kava kava, but in one way you are relaxed and thats something.I'm on day 6 now, but the anxiety ist still there maybe a little bit better than on day 3-4 but symptoms are not gone. I think it will take a month or two as i took the kratom for 8 years in high dosages. Hope to not get PAWS but i have the SOTA Bio-Tuner BT6 so i think i will not get it. Will work out as soon as my strength comes back a little. Now a short walk in the woods should be enough. Everytime i feel really shitty i just change what i am doing, go to get a hot shower or do something that distracts me. I'm thankfull that i managed to not take the sludge for 5 1/2 days and i hope i'm getting better today....

&#x200B;

\*\*\*LATER DAY 6\*\*\*

This morning was horrible. In the morning the natural cortisol melts with the adrenaline... Its horrible. But then i got out for a walk although i was very weak. But it was the right decision. Afterwards i felt MUCH better. Then i started drinking my highly sedating kava kava and vaping CBD again. I still feel a little ""rough"" or ""hard"" and i know that this will stay there for some weeks. Also still there is adrenaline pumping through my veins i can feel it. I dont like adrenaline. Not my thing. I cant understand how people like it. Kratom was my thing. No its gone. In one way its sad. But i know it was definetly the right decision. No turning back. Im 33 years now and i took this stuff for 8 years (with breakes) which is a fucking LONG time if i think about it. It gave me some things but took away the most important things: connection to the humans around me for example. It just numbs you and you feel good for yourself. But thats not human nature. Human nature is to interact with other people. We are social beeings.

\*\*\* DAY 7 EARLY MORNING \*\*\*

Got some sleep this night maybe 4 hours. Better than nothing. Vaporised some CBD Weed with 0.2% THC this morning + some noble instant vanuata kava kava ""ceremonial"" in the hope i can get a little bit more sleep. Nope. Cortisol already pumping in my veins. I'm still feeling relativly strong anxiety this morning and i accept it to be this way for some more weeks maybe. Maybe not that bad than yesterday but still way to much. But the life quality i already gained is more than worth it. Music is spectacular, like good movies. I totally forgot how it feels to really FEEEEEEL, you know ? Thanks good i had not one moment of depression. I think i can atribute this to the SOTA Bio-Tuner BT6 device and my other supplements. The 4 days phenibut with 500mg in the evening seemed no big deal. No withdrawal from that.

What really helped me yesterday was this two youtube videos please have a look:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9jhbkpwZnw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9jhbkpwZnw)

Looking back i must say this time was the easiest withdrawal i ever had thanks to the help of CBD and Kava kava and the SOTA Bio-Tuner, really. Shure it will take some while maybe month till i am completly back to normal but as soon as i can i will hit the gym.",16

2019-12-06 00:08:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/e6u24t/exercise_works_and_my_story/,Exercise works (and my story),"Wow. I used to be all into working out about 5 years ago. Lifts were going up every week, I was eating well, I was foregoing nights out with the boys for nights in the gym.  My schedule revolved around the gym and meals. I went from weighing 155 lbs to a nice 185 (some fat but a lot of muscle and definition).  I had kids and started a family and the gym became secondary. However, I still had good size and my muscles were still noticeable.

[enter kratom]

My mother read a news article about kratom being some kind of crazy zombie drug (I think she got it confused with k2 spice) and like she always does, relayed that info to me in an effort to warn me to stay away. So for me, always looking for the next high, I decided to research it. Fast forward a couple weeks, I decide to buy a 20g bag. 

HOLY SHIT! This has got to be the best thing I've tried since mdma and cocaine back in college. I literally had a small 1/4 tbs and was bouncing off the walls. I was cleaning the house, laughing and interacting with family, and just feeling great. I kept my habit to a 20g bag per week (looking back on it, I don't know how the hell I made 20g last that long).  I was able to keep kratom dosing to only after work. Life was good. 

[Fast forward 3 years]

I'm buying kilos every month, and on a 25-40 gpd habit.  My cabinet (where I keep my stash) is dusted with green powder everywhere and my clothes have little specks on green where some powder managed to escape my spoon when scooping it into my mouth.  I'm taking spoonfuls every half hour or so but no longer achieving the high that I experienced in my first few months, and I'm merely trying to maintain being OK. If I'm lucky I'll get a nice boost in the morning and I pathetically justify it by saying that'd all Im looking for.  I know that Its a problem, but quit frankly I don't care. My life now revolves around my kratom habit and I purposely don't eat so it will hit me harder. I lose all my gains I made from years of working out and sleep no more than 5 hours per night (sometimes as little as 2) because I'm waking up due to kratom withdrawals. I cry for no reason at times and I get irritated extremely easy and snap at those around me with ease. I have less mental self control in nearly every aspect of my life and my addictive personality is magnified.

I finally find reddit. Having heard about it before but never really interacting with it, I decided to seek help from fellow kratomites looking for support in quitting. I remember my first few days on finding this sub, I would wake up at 3am due to withdrawals and instantly jump onto this sub to find comfort in knowing I'm not alone. In hindsight, this sub kind of felt like an addiction, as if I was trying to replace my kratom addiction with the this sub.  I don't know if that makes sense, maybe someone can relate.

After reading countless posts, I decide to buy some otc supplements that many reccomend and proceed to taper off. I last for a few days but ultimately, once the tolerance goes down a little, like a typical addict, I keep chasing once again. This time the withdrawals and side effects of being a kratomite is not so bad, perhaps because I now feel confident that I know what is causing it and how I can remedy it. Its kind of like, I found a community to help me quit and deal with kratom so now I can feel comfortable that when I'm ready to quit I will. Typical addict mentality.

[Here comes exercise.] 

I get reintroduced to exercise through my recent interest in biohacking (which came about while trying to find a solution to reset my dopamine receptors to kick addictions; iboga looks great but won't be going to costs rica/Mexico anytime soon).

Being that I was heavily into working out, I am easily drawn back into the ""gym bug"". I start setting goals, shopping for healthy meal options to pack on lean muscle, I go to marshals and buy some workout clothes to ""feel"" the part (my old clothes no longer fit me as now I have lost over 20 lbs and am down to 160 lbs.

I reset my daily schedule to once again revolve it around my workouts and meals. It's like I took my mental focus off of kratom and replaced it with working out. Almost as if, the devil and angel on iposite shoulders were kratom and barbells, respectively.  If I could paint a picture of how I feel, it's as if my ""gym self"" is giving the big FU to the kratom addict version of me. I'm reminded of the native American proverb of the two wolves that livr in everybody, and the one that you feed is the one that is strongest in you.

Where once my meals took a backseat to my kratom addiction, the roles have now been reversed and I am much more able to ""sacrifice"" a kratom dose for a healthy meal that I know is feeding my body back to the muscle state I once possessed. Although much of this is mental and psychological, there is a physiological change that is happening as well.  Exercise is one of the best ways (the best imho) to boost dopamine which is the reason why we get drawn back into addiction. Therefore, replacing a dosing with exercise is not only helping to cut back on kratom, but it's retraining your brain to desire exercise as a dopamine boosting activity, where it once yearned for the kratom fallacy.

I'm not going to lie and tell you that I have completely quit kratom, or that I am intentionally tapering and reducing doses. I'm not. But what I am doing is prioritizing my workouts and health to where, by default, the kratom wolf inside of me is being tamed. Although kratom is still a part of my life, it no longer controls it, and exercise has given me back my authority and autonomy in determining when and how much kratom I dose. Will I eventually quit kratom? Hopefully, not sure to be honest.  However, what I do know is that I am the happiest I've been in a long time and it's NOT due to kratom.

Advice and recap:
1. Rather than focusing on ""not doing kratom"", focus on building the new version of yourself. Don't even think about kratom, just envision the new version of you that does not rely on kratom.
2.  Exercise is a must.  Even if you've never exercised in your life, you can start now and I don't know of one person who feels worse after a workout. It benefits you in many ways but especially by boosting dopamine - something that addicts yearn for.
3.  Fresh start. Do what you need to help yourself mentally feel fresh. Start new habits, meditating, new healthy routines such as Epsom salt baths with essential oils. Whatever you need to do to focus on your overall wellness.
4.  Diet, diet, diet. So much of how we feel is determined by the foods we eat. It will also help you in your workouts.
5. Be proactive and take your life back.  It's easy to feel sorry for yourself (I did this for a long time). Sulk for a while if you need to, but ultimately you need to find a way to grow a pair and take back control.

Hope this helps someone.",8

I've always refereed to myself as a junkie during my addiction. Heroin was my DOC, but if I could shoot it, smoke it, or snort it I used it. My recovery was a long battle. I started using very young and had a lot of trauma in my life. I had to spend 2 years in a recovery program learning how to just be a normal person. Once I got out of the program I continued to move my life forward even going to college. The first in my family to do so. However, I struggled with horrible anxiety, boughts of depression and insomnia. The summer of 2015 I was being treated for hep c. I was able to use one of the new treatments which has significantly less side effects than interferon, but I was hit with the worst bought of insomnia I had ever had. For over 2 months I couldn't sleep for more than 2 hours a night. I tried everything, even breaking down and getting sleeping pills from my Dr. One day I was online searching for something that could help. That's when I came across kratom. I thought well what the hell...I'll give it a try. I remember praying while I was preparing the tea...please, please let this work. A half an hour after I took it I was laying on my bed snug as a bug and I thought I had found a miracle. Something I could take and not get addicted to!!! It helped my insomnia, my anxiety and even my depression. In hind sight I was addicted within 6 months, but it wasn't until about 2 years ago that I would even consider the possibility and it's only been the last few weeks that I have finally admitted to myself that this is an addiction. I have to stop taking this shit. It will destroy my marriage if I don't, but I have zero willpower. 12 hours tops and I'm freaking out, and I'm going to buy a bag. Tomorrow...im going to try something different. Instead of CT I'm going to try to taper to relieve the panic and any withdrawal symptoms. I feel weak, and stupid. This is awful and if I can somehow get away from this shit, I'm never putting another substance in my body. Any one who actually reads this...thanks. I just need to get it out.",29

I’ve never had a day where I have used more than 30gpd, but it’s time for this to go. I have too many other goals in my life where this just doesn’t fit in. 

If anyone needs an accountability partner or is willing to talk to me about what I could expect, I’d be really appreciative. I’ve read a lot on this sub so I have a decent idea. But having support is always nice and welcome.

Long time lurker / new poster.  This community is amazing-  thank you everybody for being who you are. 

About me: 40yo, have been on and off, more on w kratom for 3 years now.  Never a heavy user but averaged 3-4gm 3 times a day.

I’m ready for this to be my true quit.  I love certain elements of kratom, it has brought me out of my shell, and enhanced my endurance performance.  

I’m ready to be done w it because I see my irritability rising, I hate the hangover feeling on the morning, I want to be the real me w all my flaws, and I don’t ever want to have to dependent on a substance to get me to baseline.

I plan on intensifying my exercise (I’m a 6-7 day a week exerciser at baseline) with more weightlifting.  Diet will be focused more on healthy foods, might even go ketogenic in the first few weeks (although it destroys my endurance performances).  I have clonidine but will try to only use it at night if I can.  I’m ramping up my vitamin C intake, taking a few supplements- tyrosine, SAM-E, pregnenolone DHEA, and threonine.  Will also likely use thc/cbd at nights.

It’s going to suck at times but I like the pain- it makes me realize that I’m human.  I’m going to focus on mindfulness and remembering despite what my brain is telling me, I am the exact same physically that I was with kratom.  I will embrace and push through the discomfort.  

Each day away will be a step towards ultimate freedom.

I’ll keep posting updates on this journey and am happy to answer questions.  You will be my accountability!",16

Another quit attempt after a quit effort in October, ending on day 28 (Nov 9). Twice daily use (<10/g) for two weeks, escalating to ~20g/day the week before quitting.  

&nbsp;

Day 1
Morning: Even this early, signs of withdrawal. Increasing anxiety and tachycardia. Little appetite. Skin occasionally feels very hot. Tired, but with a growing sense of restlessness. Took 0.25mg clonazepam.   
Afternoon: Moderate depression/crying. Drank some green tea and felt better very quickly, almost hypomanic. Yawning/watery eyes/runny nose. 
Night: Strong unpleasant smell, malaise. Everything feels dirty. ‘Sharp’ vision. Time dilation. Mild stomach issues. Took 0.25mg clonazepam to sleep.  

&nbsp;

Day 2
Morning: Slept ok thankfully. Stomach/sinus issues, but not too bad. Slightly dizzy. Some sweating/chills. 
Afternoon: Stomach issues worsening. Boredom and a little depression but luckily no hopelessness. Restlessness in waves. Significant time dilation. 
Evening: Very restless around 5pm. Hard to focus on anything for long. Full of anxious energy. Sneezing. Feeling regretful and overwhelmed. Took 0.5mg clonazepam. Feeling very strange; like a weak and unpleasant psychedelic experience. The season seems wrong, and I feel out of place in time. A nebulous melancholy nostalgia troubles me.

&nbsp;

Day 3
Morning: Broken sleep. All symptoms persist. Feel somewhat depressed. The day is dragging with profound time dilation. 
Afternoon: Time is really dragging with the anhedonia and physical symptoms mentioned before (fortunately not too intense). Was able to take a nap and then felt better. Even went out for an hour. 
Evening: Initially felt ok and was able to eat a good amount. Took 0.25mg clonazepam for sleep. Woke up in the middle of the night and had a rough night. Very weird intense dreams. After waking, restlessness and unpleasant smell/taste were strong. Odd headspace while semi-conscious reminiscent of much stronger withdrawals; the same bizarre thoughts loop around my mind. Glad I could sleep the previous two nights because this is really draining.

On to day 4

I also have some of my own experience that I hope to share for others.

I started with kratom 12 years ago, before every damn gas station and tobacco shop carried it. I was a daily user of around 28 grams plus a bonus dose on tough days...  

I was unsuccessfully trying to taper for about 6 months and then went cold turkey about 2 months ago.

I feel like kratom helped my anxiety and extreme introverted personality initially but then it turned into an extreme downside pretty quickly. I started using it multiple times a day every day about 10 years ago and it took a long time to realize the affect it had. It stole my emotions from me. It made most days better at least for a while but it also stole the ups and downs that normal people are supposed to experience. I went through 10 years of my life with this and didn't realize what I was missing until I quit and started feeling things again.

I was lucky or unlucky to start my cold turkey withdrawal while at home and on oxy for a surgery...  Made things easier initially but I'm at about 10 or so weeks right now and have gotten some serious brain fog.",31

Come to read a post with some comments by snoodeal and jiminjersey about weights and measures for k.. then researched a couple others- and found that theres about 4 grams in a tsp. 12 in a tbsp.

I guess I had been taking 70 to 90 gpd.  Was wondering why it was SO GOD DAMN hard to get off. Taper in mid July started. Jumped off in mid Sept at what I thought was 20, but was 35 Gpd.  

Now I get why @gregnice took 5 months on his slow taper from 80. Its a fucking ungodly amt. And my taper was way too fast.

Never posted anything before on something like this so I’m not sure if this is where to post this but I’m looking for some people who have been through Kratom withdrawals or successful tapers in the past. I’ve gone to rehab for Kratom once before and was clean about 3 months before I went back to it. I’ve been taking it ever since which has been about a year. 4 times a day about 65gpd. 

Can’t go to rehab because I have a family and I need to work and am responsible for our income so my wife was nice enough to help me taper. I need help with a taper because I can’t do it on my own. I always end up taking as much as I want. I’m on day 2. Really not much discomfort except for the 10 hour gap between my doses from day 1. 

I’m cutting my dosing down to 6 grams in the morning, 6 grams in the late afternoon and 10 grams before bed. Much better than where I was. From here I’m going to be cutting down more by the week. 

Supplements I’m taking are CBD, ashwaganda and I had a prescription for propranolol left over so I’ve been taking that. 

Any advice or support would be much appreciated. Just looking for some people to talk to who have been through what I’ve been through. Thanks",3

I thought it might be good to update here since the majority of posts I have found about Kratom use and hormones are from men.

So far I believe I have seen improvement. Sorry for the TMI, but, I get wet again (!!!!!). And I have a sex drive!!!! Also, while on Kratom it seemed my boobs had basically deflated, and they are starting to fill out the cups of my bras properly again (and no this is not a weight thing, no change in weight). While I still got a second period (outside of my BCP placebo week) between now and my last post, it was MUCH shorter and lighter (2 days rather than 8)... all in all I think my hormone issues are starting to resolve themselves now that I have stopped putting Kratom in my body.

My theory is that maybe Kratom was causing issues with absorbing my birth control pill... however I never had digestive issues while taking Kratom so I’m not sure how that would work. I do want to put that idea out there though, because when I began taking Kratom I didn’t at all take my birth control pill into consideration and in hindsight that was pretty irresponsible, regardless of whether or not there is truly a contraindication there. I guess any increased risk of pregnancy would be reduced by the insane lack of libido that Kratom causes though (Kidding). 

Unfortunately I can’t speak to improvement on my hair loss yet. My fear is  that the hormone issues that Kratom was causing me may have triggered early onset AGA. I’m not shedding like crazy anymore but I’m not seeing new growth yet.

And just to be clear — I cannot stress this enough — Kratom has been the ONLY changed factor in all of this. I have been on the same hormonal BCP for over a decade.",5

Ave 50 gpd for 3 years with a 3 month break in between. I honestly convinced myself after being clean for 90 days, I could use like a normal person 2-3 days a week 😂

First two weeks were rough, anxiety faded around day 13. After about 20 days I would feel great for a few days, then crappy and apathetic for a few so on and so forth. Right now I’m feeling pretty good again, and those waves are shorter. 

I still get aches and pains a lot, sleeps much better but still could improve, energy is better and better as long as I exercise, stomach is still blah a lot of the time, I won’t ever take imodium. Need to stay consistent with diet, workout and meditate more. 

Most importantly I’m letting life happen and I’m not running off getting numb to it anymore when I’m uncomfortable or emotional. I have a therapist now who’s really helping change my perspective on life. I wish I started this years ago. 

I also started taking low dose naltrexone 9 days ago and it’s working wonders. For the first time in my life I actually wake up feeling pretty good, way less grumpy and tired then I used to. I’m up to 2.1mg right now and I’m much happier throughout the day, it’s very weird.

I've managed to get down to 2 to 3 grams per day. I was taking this reduced dose at night because RLS is my worst symptom. I have tried several nights now to just jump and not take any. However, I cannot get through the night to sleep. I have insomnia and RLS when I take no kratom at all. My habit started as a ""nightcap"" and I'm thinking that my body is used to having the opiate right before I fall asleep. Now that I'm trying to take it away completely, my body might be agitated.

I asked my doctor for Requip after having told her all about my kratom use and my downward titration. However, the Requip is not helping. It is a dopamine agonist, not an opiate. I know that there is a endogenous opiate system in the body. Perhaps it is still down-regulated and I need to stretch out my taper a lot onger. I read a handbook by the CDC that actually suggests a 10% reduction per month of opioids. That pace is for someone like me who used a substance for over a year. It was actually three years.

Any ideas? I had to take some kratom tonight because I have a lot of things to do at work tomorrow. I am seriously trying my best and doing the necessary work. But, I am in a painted corner.",2

Hope you don’t mind my posting 2x in a day. This community has been so helpful and supportive and I really wish people experimenting with Kratom had read some of our stories beforehand...so I wanna be as helpful as I can. If I can prevent one person from going down this sludgey green road or quit it, it’s worth it to write.

Today was a bit of a rollercoaster physically but I’m much better mentally. I felt pretty rough this morning til mt doctor’s appt, going two whole nights without sleep. I’m trying to joke about it as if I have superpowers (world record is 264.4 hours so I am not even close yet haha). Also my mom found my sneezing 6x in a row 3x this morning absolutely hilarious. It helps to not take yourself too seriously.

After my appointment with my doctor that I discussed in my previous post (tl;dr - docs aren’t considering kratom abusers addicts, as there is so much misinformation and we thought we had found a safe, natural alternative), the prescriptions were sent to the pharmacy in the city where I had lived last year so I had to wait 6 hours after my appt to pick them up. Just made me stronger, I told myself (rapid suboxone taper for 7 days, clonodine, 2 mg valium for sleep).

I took the clonodine first to see exactly what it would do. My skin sensitivity and hot flashes I’ve been getting for the past ~2 years when I’m anxious about something disappeared miraculously. I also felt like my heart wasn’t going to jump out of my chest (my bp is usually crazy low and today it was higher than ever in my life). The clonodine brought it back to normal for me within an hour.

I then took the suboxone. My doc said I came in at the perfect time...if you start less than ~12ish hours into quitting, you risk the menace of precipated w/d if suboxone is administered too soon. On Day 3 and in full-blown acute w/ds, I was in no danger. Suboxone kicked in almost immediately. Tbh, it was a little bit too intense and I’m glad I was just watching The Writer on Netlfix and not driving or at work. (Btw, The Writer is a GREAT show if you need something to take your mind off of w/ds or quitting). The suboxone is def stronger than an OPMS shot (or two), so I’m glad I’m cutting my dose in half each day over the next week. My sense of touch almost immediately became less sensitive and I felt...balanced. Or more balanced than I ever had been with Kratom if that makes sense.

About 1 hour after taking the suboxone and 2 after taking the clonodine, my chest got really heavy and I got crazy lightheaded. Alas, it was just my blood pressure returning to normal. I then got this crazy motivation to move, so I laced up and went on a 15 min jog and 15 min walk in the cold. It felt great and so much easier than running on Kratom, which makes you FEEL faster at first but ultimately slows you down. I then took a hot shower and cleaned house, something I’ve put off doing for far too long.

The only bad thing that happened today was throwing up after eating just a small dinner - GF ravioli with gourmet mushrooms, spinach, and chicken. It came out of nowhere but passed very quickly and I feel fine now. It probably was the suboxone + running + eating combo but who knows. NBD. The thing I like about the suboxone taper is it will kill my ability to go buy kratom in the next two weeks, since the opiate receptors will be filled already. It gives me time to change my habits and daily routine.

Overall, some of the things I noticed were as follows: My face and stomach were wayyyy less bloated than they’ve been the past two years; I wanted to spend time with my family and obnoxiously shout out answers to Jeopardy questions; I wanted to run again and it felt so natural; my sense of touch and skin burning/tingling sensation is gone; I started noticing random details in the house and around the neighborhood when I went jogging that I forgot existed; I actually got excited about Christmas and enjoyed seeing all the lights; foods that hadn’t sounded good the last two years sounded appetizing; I wanted to clean house and took pride in it again; I started enjoying trance and classical music again, my two favorite genres. I felt more alert but more calm than I have ever felt on Kratom, and I haven’t even taken any valium yet; and last but not least, I really started missing my SO (he’s got the flu while I’ve been dealing with this so we haven’t seen eachother since Friday which is TOO LONG).

I realize my detox is probably accelerated vis-a-vis folks who don’t have the ability to schedule an appointment with a pain mgmt/addiction/depency specialist, but my point is this: KEEP PUSHING ON. You have so much rediscovering to do and you will get better and stronger because of your struggles. You are human and allowed to make mistakes. Hope you all get some sleep tonight, wherever you are, and be well.",8

I measured my dose today, and it was a pleasant surprise. Honestly before I decided to taper I was probably doing 40-60gpd. I was going through 250g a week for a fact. I decided to cut down and these last two days I took enough to not die, but substantially less. I felt tired, anxious, depressed. Worst of all I figured I was making little to no progress.

I measured my dose, the amount I’ve taken total this day. And it was 22g! That is substantially less then I thought. I think I stand a chance with this demon.

I decided to quit because this shit is controlling my life. I can’t do shit without kratom tagging along for the ride...

Out on a date? You be ima be being a small bag of kratom to redose 1-2 times! Out on a hike? I’m bringing my bag o kratom you know it.. I’ve been wanting to start doing yoga, but I can’t figure out a way to bring this shit with me.. that’s how hooked I am to this substance. When I go to work I’m always caring my bottle with kratom in it. Shit when I wake up in the morning I can barely get out of bed.

This shit is crazy. And to think when I started I thought “this stuff is legal, it can’t be that bad, I have control over my own life, plus kratom helps me with blah blah blah.

I forced myself to do some cardio exercise as much as I can do then took an ice cold shower for about two minutes that seemed to really help out and get some endorphins flowing. I am leaving the country this weekend luckily to a place where kratom is illegal so if I make it till Saturday Kratom free ill have another week under my belt when I return. I appreciate every single person on this thread. Keep fighting .",11

I've had my last dose Friday morning, I took +/- 20 g/d. The next order was supposed to be in by Saturday, but it didn't. Due to post delays it's arriving somewhere these days.

In these 4 days I've had terrible withdrawal symptoms, but they are starting to subside now. 
The thing I'm afraid of is that I'm gonna be in a long term depression. When I first took it I felt like I had a glimpse in a world in which I could achieve anything and depression wasn't part of me anymore. Now that I quit I feel like there's a good chance that I'm gonna be depressed again the same way I was before kratom and I'm so very much afraid of that. 

I withdrew several times. I always found a reason to buy it again. I feel like my decision is much stronger now. I told some of my roommates/friends just as a sort of coming out I guess and that felt really good. I have caring friends and that helps a lot. 

There's no really insightful conclusion to this. I just don't know if I'm able to do this and whether I'm strong enough to get pleasure out of other thing. I'm gonna try exercise and hope that it helps. 

I hope you're all doing okay and I hope that you can find the motivation to succeed in this struggle.",19

I am on day 4 with the help of some small dose Suboxone after trying to quit a few times - blah, blah, blah, you've heard it before.


Anyway, I feel like I'm doing pretty well, not much physical discomfort breaking through yet today.


My problem: so I'm a mom to a three year old, I have no vehicle, haven't had one for a few years now and I pretty much never leave the house. MAYBE once a week to go grocery shopping if I'm lucky (woo! So exhilarating). As you can imagine, this is VERY depressing. 

Kratom helped me to, at the very least, be content with my entrapment. Which Kratom replaced the painkillers that also provided that distraction. I guess one positive is I'm fully aware of the reasons for my mental escapes.

But now that I'm trying this again I'm so fucking antsy it's unreal. I don't know that I'd call it ""anxiety"" but I am so anxious to get out and do things. I've always had this deeply rooted desire to do great things, I've just buried it for years. I went through this the last time I quit, I did it on my own but only lasted two weeks because I literally couldn't stand it anymore.


I can't work because I have no vehicle, can't get a vehicle without working. Throw childcare in there and the hole gets deeper. I've tried to think of any possible way out a million times over and I just don't know what to do. Not to mention my toddler is antsy constantly too because he hardly gets to see the world and I so badly want to do fun things with him. But mom's a loser who can't take him anywhere just because.


I know there is a wide variety of people here with different life experiences, so is there ANYONE else out there in my situation or that can relate that can please give me some helpful tips for combatting this and further my progress? Because at this point I'm seriously contemplating just throwing myself into the void and going back to the Kratom and coming to terms with it just being how my life is meant to be even though I hunger for so much more.


Please be gentle with your words, subs or not I'm still feeling pretty fragile.",4

Just decide, 

“Right now, in this moment, I’m not going to take Kratom” 

You don’t have to think a year down the road, a month, a day, or even an hour. Even a minute... 

Just take it moment by moment, and if you do this enough, if you keep saying “right now, in this moment, I choose not to take Kratom”, you’ll look back and realize it’s been a day, a month, a year. 

If you have cravings, just let them pass like leaves in a stream. They will go away. Observe the thought, but don’t let the thought grab hold of you. 

Take it moment by moment, if being sober tomorrow seems out of reach. Every moment you decide to not use the drug, is another victory.",54
2019-12-03 11:05:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/e5j7gz/my_cold_turkey_quit_remedies_i_suggest_reading_if/,My cold turkey quit remedies. I suggest reading if you’re going ct :),"I’ve had a few people ask me for details on my cold turkey quit remedies, so I decided I would just make my own, more detailed post about it. I know what works for some may not work for others. But if this post helps anyone, it’s worth the write :) Disclosure at bottom. I am not recommending any of these remedies for anyone. Only sharing what works with myself. (Please delete if not allowed, but I did chose my words very carefully) 

I’ve never been able to properly taper, so cold turkey is my only way to quit. I start off setting a quit date, usually at least a month ahead of time and letting my husband know the plan, the date, and let him know this is what I want and no matter what, don’t let me back out of it. This gives me time to mentally and strategically prepare. The week of my quit, I’ll stock the house up on groceries and easy and/or pre prepped meals. I will prepare my withdrawal kit. And the day before my quit I will clean the house spotless, laundry, errands, etc. My last dose will be Friday evening. Close enough to bedtime to where I won’t wake up too early feeling bad, and far enough from bedtime to where I will get to sleep at a decent time; Usually around 8:30pm. 

In my withdrawal kit I have mostly vitamins and supplements and over the counter remedies. But I also have a few prescriptions I use. I’ll add those into my schedule, but if you don’t have access to these, it’s still the same routine minus those prescription rxs. The prescriptions rxs are:
-Gabapentin. easy to get from your doctor without having to disclose your addiction status. It’s prescribed for nerve pain and for restless legs and is not a controlled substance. I have them for restless legs and jaw/facial pain. But when used for a long period of time and at high doses, you can withdrawal from them as well. 
-Topamax. prescribed for migraines and to treat epilepsy.
-Elavil. nerve pain and antidepressant. 
-Phenergan. anti nausea (sleep)


The rest of my kit includes: multivitamins, magnesium, iron, valerian root, b12, melatonin, the brand hylands restful legs relief, loperamide, and epson salts. Lots of Gatorade and water, bananas, pre cleaned sets of comfy clothes, pjs, and bed sheets. 

I’ll wake up in the morning to withdrawals kicking in. Not too bad, but where I normally head straight to dosing before doing pretty much anything else. I’ll start the day with forcing myself to eat something. Eggs are high in protein. After having something in my stomach I’ll take a multivitamin, iron, magnesium, and gabapentin(100’mg). I’ll take phenergan if I feel the vitamins will upset my stomach, but they usually don’t. And phenergan can make you sleepy. If I want to sleep during the day or anxiety is an issue, I can take valerian root also. But I do not because anxiety is never a big issue with my withdrawal and I prefer not to sleep during the day. It wont necessarily make me tired either, so if I am having trouble with anxiety I take it. Loperamide will help with diarrhea if that’s an issue. Take as prescribed. Topamax and elavil is not a medication I take often. It doesn’t really help with physical symptoms. The best way to describe it is it makes time seem meaningless and it goes by very quickly. I’ll rest and relax with movies that keep my attention. If I can force myself to do light housework or a small walk, I do it. It helps with mood and can help with restless legs in the evening. Drink lots and lots of fluids. Eat a small lunch and take another round of vitamins listed above, another gabapentin, and include b12. My body will just pee out any vitamin it doesn’t need. I avoid caffeine from now until tomorrow morning. A small dinner and no vitamins. Restless legs and the sweats/chills are my biggest complaint during withdrawal. At nighttime is where I have the strictest routine. No electronics at least an hour to two hours before bed. I’ll take a hot epson salt bath, valerian root, small dose of melatonin, 3 gabapentins, iron, magnesium, a phenergan, the hylands restfles legs aid, and eat a banana. I play white noise in my bedroom, wear light clothing, and make it as dark as possible. If I can’t sleep, I get up and do something mundane like laundry or a small walk instead of tossing and turning. As soon as I feel tired again, I lay down. Anytime I wake up I eat another banana and change into a clean pair of pjs I have already set out. And sheets if necessary. I try to avoid any light (especially blue light like your phone or tv) as much as possible  

I repeat this whole process for the the next 3 days. Once I hit the 72 hour mark it gets much better from then on out. I do not take gabapentin more than three days in a row. It builds up tolerance insanely quick and when used for a long period of time, you can withdrawal from those as well. Once I’m through the first three days and I’m feeling a bit better, I’ll start a morning routine as well. Wake up, turn music on, shower, hair/makeup, breakfast, and morning walk. 

I know I’ve ranted for a while and I’ll be surprised if anyone gets to this point lol. And I’m sure Ive left out something and I’ll remember and edit later haha. But I hope someone will get something from this post. I’ve accumulated all of this from reading through Reddit for years and picking out what works best for me. Just recently I created a new reddit account (lost username and password to old one after a long time without using)because I’m always on reddit and felt the need to contribute. It has helped me immensely throughout the years and I wish to pay it forward with my personal remedies. I wish all of you the best of luck in your journey to a happy and healthy life!

2019-12-03 10:43:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/e5iw53/day_24_ct_feeling_awesome_today/,Day 24 CT - Feeling Awesome Today!,"Hi All,

I just wanted to give an update this morning.  I noticed this morning I finally got to wake up with ALL my heavy blankets on top of me and I wasn't the slightest bit sweaty!!!  I know I've mentioned this before, but looking back now I have NEVER been someone who sweats, I am about 95-100 lbs and am always freezing in the winter.  So this was a whole new experience for me and oddly enough I found it disgusting.  I am so happy this has finally stopped.  

So I know I mentioned before I also quit drinking/all drugs over 5 months ago. Kratom was the only thing I started doing and stopped 24 days ago.  What happened during this timeframe was that I didn't really even miss alcohol that much because I had replaced it with kratom.  It wasn't until this last week when the misery of w/d's finally lessened and I felt normal again that of course I started CRAVING alcohol BAD.  And you know it's bad when you start contemplating going to the bar and imagining yourself sitting there drinking.  But I learned this awesome tool in Smart Recovery a long time ago called, ""Playing the tape Forward.""  And for any of you that have never heard of Smart, please check it out! It's a really awesome addiction recovery program on the web and there are face to face meetings too.  It's an alternative to 12 step meetings and teaches self empowerment.  [https://www.smartrecovery.org](https://www.smartrecovery.org)

So playing the tape is a tool you can use whenever you get a craving/urge.  You simply imagine the scenario from start until the next morning.  So for example, I played out ....go to bar, tell myself I'll have just a glass of wine...that leads to two glasses, then a beer, then a margarita, then go to next bar, on and on...then probably eat a bunch of junk and consume a good 1,000 calories on top of all the other alcohol calories or get speed and stay up until after sunrise.  OR like a dumb ass get in my car and drive...and THEN what if i get pulled over?!!  I'm going to jail this time for good!! With another $10,000 - $20,000 rack up of debt and totally F my life up.  OR even if that doesn't happen, I will wake up and feel like total shit, spend half the morning in bed, call off work, or go to work all over and then get off and drink again to feel better.  

SO then you play the tape backwards, right?  And you visualize the entire night and what will happen if you don't drink until you wake up.  So what I do if I really just want to go to my old favorite bar hangout is go there and get a non-alcoholic beer, eat my favorite meal, chat with my server friends, go home, get a great night's sleep, wake up feeling awesome and go have a killer workout.  Win Win!!   This tool really helps a lot and I've used it with kratom too.  I think it's the waking up from a horrible night's sleep and being hooked on the sludge again that makes me feel like... no way, I'm not going to let myself get hooked back into that trap!  Too much money and the tolerance will only keep growing and it will stop working again.  

But all this being said, last night at work I started having really bad cravings again for alcohol and feeling depressed and miserable that my life would be no fun without it.  But again, I know this is the addictive voice talking and it's amazing how quickly we can forget the full spectrum of what all our addiction entails.  I found a book awhile back by this guy Allen Carr and then Annie Grace remade it.  They are really good books if you are interested because it changes the mindset from one of deprivation to FREEDOM from addictive substances.  He made a book on quitting smoking too.  But if you read this book you could apply a lot of it to kratom addiction too.  It's called, ""The Easy Way to Control Drinking"" by Allen Carr and ""This Naked Mind"" by Annie Grace.  I found them both super helpful.  Last night when I came home and feeling all down and out I found a lady who read Annie's book and another one ""Oneyearnobeer.""  She reminded me of all the blessings of quitting drinking and totally made me feel a million times better again.  She was so positive and uplifting I just wanted to share all of this with you.  You can take her benefits and apply them to kratom addiction.  

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DSy1pEazhM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DSy1pEazhM)

Why am I sharing all of this?  I know how much I've struggled with my own addictions and I am bound and determined to get through all of this and end up successful this time around.  I feel like there are a TON of people on this forum looking for help and I want to share whatever I can that has been helpful for myself.  Something is pulling at me this morning to post all of this so here it is.

I freaked out so bad about my drinking cravings on Sunday I even ended up asking my pastor if I could start a Smart meeting there (I used to be a Smart Facilitator until I relapsed 2.5 years ago unfortunately), and I'm hoping he says yes.  I've noticed the people who are successful at staying stopped from their addiction usually have some type of serious accountability to a program of some sort.  I was sober for 1.5 years when I facilitated before, but I got sucked back into my addiction when my ex came back in the picture and kept egging me on to drink again.  He's such a prick. Anyhow, I hope my essay helps someone out there.  I'm off to the gym now to go run an 8 mile speed workout to burn off the rest of all this energy!!!  

Much love all!!",15

Over the past couple of weeks my stomach normalized, that was really the only symptom that lingered the longest. Yea kratom pops in my head every now and then, a couple times a day sometimes, but only as a reminder of how fucking awesome life is now, and what will happen if i ever touch the shit again. 
If you are stuggling today just know its only a matter of time until you get back to baseline. I made it and i feel fucking amazing.
I remember reading multiple posts that it will take a month for every year you are on kratom to get back to normal. 
Well i was on kratom for about 2.5 years, and here i am about 2.5 months out from the last dose and im back to normal.

I've been doing this for just over two years.

It doesn't really offer any effects anymore except making me tired. I can't increase the dosage without getting physically sick (good, I guess??)

I'd like to stop as it may be causing long term side effects. I have severe chronic fatigue AND insomnia, and my sleep cycle is so irregular it's not funny. I'm also severely depressed bordering on suicide and have little motivation for anything. Now I'm also an MS patient so the fatigue could be from that but I'm not sure.

Also, it is a waste of time, taking 1-2 hours a night to consume. When I am with others overnight (especially traveling) I need to bring extract which is $30/day. Also I don't like being physically dependent on something that's not super easy to obtain in a jam.

I had severe drug addiction issues in my past, including opioids, and am worried I will eventually crave the ""real thing"". I'm a real adult now and that would ruin my life after six years sober.

I haven't gone more than 48 hours without (maximum) so I don't know what cold-turkey withdrawals would be like. I can say that past 36 hours I get restless legs. 

I'm not sure exactly what my plan is. Perhaps I'll taper down to 30mg/day for a while, then do 15mg, then 10, then 5. And since sitting down for an hour and drinking hot liquid is so routine, drink a glass of hot tea until I can let that go?

I know there are guides all over and I've read other messages. Just wanted to post this here. Thanks.",1

There’s a big kava/kratom community where I live, which is how I got into kratom to begin with, and for so long all I ever saw was people praising this supposed MiRaClE PlAnT. God forbid I ever asked about side effects; I’d be accused of not wanting addicts to get clean or of spreading “dangerous misinformation,” but this shit sucks. 

I’ve never taken capsules, only tea. I’ve wanted to quit for awhile, and even tried tapering last year but only ended up convincing myself it “isn’t really that bad after all.” 

But I’m tired y’all. Tired of feeling zero desire to do anything. Tired of the weird anxiety spikes. Tired of feeling like shit when I go too long between teas. Tired of sleeping for 15 hours a day like it’s normal. Tired of sleeping through my alarm and getting in trouble at work. Tired of wondering if it’s all because of kratom, and tired of being afraid of the answer. 

It’s been about 12 hours. I’ve read a lot of your stories and I wish I could hug each of you. You guys are badasses, truly. 

I’m struggling with nausea and feeling flu-ish, sortof like my skin is “too sensitive” or my nerves are super “alert” and “annoyed,” if that makes any sense. But I’m done. To hell with this.

Convincing me to tell someone close to me (my mom) has meant the world to me because she has been so freakin’ supportive, despite the fact her daughter has three degrees (and chronic illness and four major surgeries in 8 years but I digress)...

My mom insisted I see an addiction psych. I did - he was chill and understanding. Other than reaking of nicotine (I’ve got asthma and this all seemed a bit hypocritical to me tbh) it was good. He didn’t know A LOT about Kratom, only that w/d was similar to opioids. I’m not shaky (cheers to being a 15-half marathon runner with a 1:30 PR) so he didn’t think I needed inpatient. I agree. If I can’t sleep at home where my golden retriever is, how will I sleep at all?

He tried to convince me to do intensive group inpatient but I would have to 100% abstain from alcohol and attend three hours sessions every...freakin...day. I was like no thank you, that would be extremely triggering and I honestly don’t have an issue with alcohol. It would be the next 20 days, and as my SO is pretty high in society here, that would mean no dirty martinis. (I’m also a craft ale snob). I’ve never drank to excess since sorority mixers and frat formals in college, 8 years ago).

He assigned me to a psych (cool, I’ll go with it, I already know that the root problem for me is I DO NOT want to practice law and my fam and SO are more or less forcing me to because I had so much success writing for the federal judiciary 1 yr before back surgery, hence I numbed the pain with Kratom til 7 pm Saturday night, but whatever). I asked him abt subs, having been put on them to taper off of oxy (never abused, legit batched back surgery in 2016) and I had no w/ds whatsoever. He said we don’t do that, but here are some names.

None of his names have openings tomorrow. My old pain dr also treats kratom addiction now and got me in at 9:30 tomorrow. I’m assuming he’ll treat me with suboxone like he would an oxy/heroin dependent person (I don’t like the word addict - we are all so much more than that!) He was fine with me seeing the old doctor so that doctor is booked. Then I’m seeing my PCP for the crazy anxiety.

My question for you noble people is should I even need subs by day 3? I still feel shitty, have extreme sneezing bouts and goosebumps, but I’m feeling a glimmer of hope at the end of day 2. Maybe it’s a wave (is that what it’s called). If I do, I’m sure I would only need a quick (4-7 day taper). I know I couldn’t abuse because I have no street smarts and it’s not like the pharmacies are headshops.

I quit CT from a very large habit that lasted years, and I was only 20 at the time. It was brutal for me and took many months to get past the worst as I have underlying anxiety and depression which were amplified considerably. I quit for over two years before picking it back up a little over two years ago.

So here I am, in a terrible position once again. I worked so hard and I was so active here and in my life to not fail and it was the first time I was legitimately proud of myself and it’s all gone downhill again.

I have the opportunity to go on an amazing trip. The problem is, it’s in two weeks and the country I’m going to is a place where it’s very illegal so I have no option. I either find some type of relief or I don’t go. I’ve been on international trips in the past and CT for a couple weeks while I was gone and I simply can’t do that again.

So, to help the depression I’ve been put on Wellbutrin. Unfortunately that’s not great for anxiety but I’m on the smallest possible dose. Can someone recommend anything that could help? I use BSO regularly although it makes Kratom less effective for me and I can’t bring any other prescription drugs with me. I’m thinking of resulting to Loperamide.

I’ve been involved with this substance since about 2007, going through the usual phases (exploratory, honeymoon, problematic dependence, etc.) I had naively assumed knowing about addiction would prevent it, but obviously that’s not the way it works. 

Long story short, I quit for about a year and a half, then started up again this spring. I’ve quit and relapsed many times since then, and I can feel myself drawing increasing nearer to the hell I thought I had escaped (~50g/day for 3yr). So I’m giving it one more go. No one in my life is aware of this dirty little secret. 

Today is day 1 after a three week relapse (12-24g/day) following a 28 day quit. Hoping this won’t be too bad, but the last time was much more intense and protracted than I’d anticipated. After this, I’d like to start naltrexone.",5

Thought it helped me with depression and motivation, and it does in a weirs way, but it also contributes.

I have lied to my family myself, my SO and everyone else to continue using.

I just pawned pretty much the last thing I could, all things Important to me, guitar stuff. Been playing for over half my life.

I’ve lost my job etc etc.

So now I should be grateful I’m staying at my parent’s, but no, I’ve stolen from them and lied to them too.


I’m on probation for a dui and I have outpatient as part of my requirements.

They test for everything, and because i was honest during the assesment, I am getting tested for Kratom too.

I made an ultimatum that I had one more week to try to quit on my own and if it doesn’t work then I’ll get into in patient. I told my parents and 
My PO, lead group dude, and my therapist. 

So I failed and I’m going to go into in patient, so long as I can get in and all that. 

So it’s the holidays and it takes awhile anyways.

My stupid addict brain was like: well I’ve done it this whole time might as well continue until I have to go. Well it’s been a week and still waiting.

Meanwhile if I’m high I can’t go to out patient... which I’m high everyday on this shit but no one would know really.


Anyway, 32 years old... at my retired parents house, no job, no hope, just waiting for in patient.

I really hope people take this drug seriously, I absolutely have the worst withdrawls I have ever had from any drug and it’s got a hold of me worse than anything.

I hate it.


I want to be free from this dirt for good and until I do I just keep stealing, keep lying, keep
Pawning shit I love, and keep hurting everyone involved in my life.

I’m sick of it.

I decided I had enough and was quick tapering down but after a week my wife found me taking some and she is furious. She would have left me already because I was drinking to cope with depression 2 years ago and if I ever hid anything from her she was gonna be gone. The only reason she hasn’t is because she is a stay at home mom and we have 2 kids under 4. Kratom helped me feel better for a while but made things way worse and I finally had enough but it was too late. That sucks and I hope I can save it because she means the world to me and is so amazing! She has a lot on her plate already and being a guy, my mindset was to get better myself instead of piling my issues on to her. But marriage should be helping each other and I know I’m not good at that. Counselling starts tomorrow. 

Now on to the game changer. I have tried quitting before and it was unbearable! Even at the time I used less it still sucked and I couldn’t take it for long. After my wife found out I went to see the Doctor. I went through everything with him and came clean. He prescribed me Mirtazapine which I thought was to help addiction but it is more for depression. I started taking it and my wife and I agreed to be at my best I should taper. I started on Monday with 3 doses of 1 tsp spaced out and I had a bit of trouble sleeping. Next day I took out half a tsp for my mid day dose and kept doing that. Surprisingly I didn’t feel too bad. Friday my wife had the stomach flu so I was in Dad duty all day and stuck with my taper and felt some discomfort but not bad. Saturday we went to the city to Christmas shop for our kids and it was a good day. I took 1 tsp before we left and I didn’t feel any good effects and kind of made me feel blah. I made it comfortably all day until bedtime when I took another tsp to try to get a great night sleep and I felt sick after taking it. The next day I felt relatively normal. I wondered how is this possible, I tapered over a week?! I shouldn’t be this used to so little already? I jumped Sunday Dec 1. My last dose was on Nov 30. 

I actually think the Mirtazapine must be the reason that this has seemed so smooth this time vs any other time! I feel like it must affect the same area of the brain that Kratom does because it takes a few days for the Mirtazapine to kick in and as it has Kratom has had less effect and I haven’t felt as many withdrawals. I’m not getting ridiculous cold sweats or anything. I don’t have diarrhea constantly. I’ve slept good every night. The Mirt makes me drowsy so I take it at night before bed. Last time I tried to quit, I couldn’t sleep at all. I don’t know if anyone else has experienced this or has tried Mirtazapine but I feel like between this and my motivation to be done with K, being 36 hours in, my head feels clearer and I’m motivated to try to save my marriage. Hold strong everyone! If anyone has questions please ask! This place is great! And I think everyone should give Mirtazapine a try as it’s the only explanation to me being able to get to this point so quickly!",2

But my wife wasn’t feeling great Saturday and she was wanting milk shakes so I ended up spending the money on stuff for that and some snacks at the grocery store that night. Any other time I would’ve ended up saving that money for k. I can tell something has changed this quit. I’ve had cravings but for some reason nothing has even brought me close to relapsing this time around. Pretty proud of myself. I just wanted to share something positive with you guys.

It is not. 2 years in I finally figured out his personality changes where from kratom and it only got worse from there.  He has promised to quit for 2 years with zero success and some very scary, intense episodes. We have 5 amazing kids together and 14 years of marriage and now it seems hopeless.  He lies and lies about using. Will buy it at gas stations and lie. I dont know what to do. He is a different person then the wonderful person I married . We were the couple everyone wanted to be. So much love and respect and it's gone. We have tried to have him quit cold Turkey, hence the scarey situations, wont get into them, but no one should have to deal with what me and my children have. We have tried tapering but with him working out of town and it being so accessible, that always fails. He is pretty much the breadwinner so rehab would be financially very difficult but it seems like the only way to defeat this monster. Watching the most kind, patient, loving person you ever met turn into a stranger has been the hardest thing I have ever experienced especially when there isnt a damn thing I can do but hope and pray it gets better. His sex drive and affectionate personality is all but dead.  What can I do to help my husband get off this shit?????? It's to the point of he gets off or we get divorced which was never an option or ever even a consideration in our amazing love story till kratom entered the picture.

I’ve tapered down to 2.5 grams per day, just at night. During the day I have very little withdrawal symptoms other than just kinda feeling a little weak and fidgety. Anxiety really isn’t so bad. 

My therapist really wants me to quit on Tuesday. I think that I’ve gotten to a dose where this won’t be so bad, but I’m pretty terrified of not being able to sleep which will inevitably make the WD’s worse, seeing as I initially started Kratom to combat insomnia in the first place. The addict brain in me wants to keep it at 2.5 gpd for a few more days before completely tapering off, but I feel like that might just be prolonging the whole process and making things harder than they need to be. 

I’ve been using daily for two years by the way. For most of it I’ve kept it very low, under 5gpd, but in May I went through a bad breakup and got up to 10-15 gpd. Luckily that didn’t last too long and I’ve tapered down.

I hope everybody is well and staying off the Kratom!! So in this post I will share my breif story of what happened to me so you dont have to go through my other posts and then if you have any experience with this sort of thing or know about trauma in general please feel free to share you opinion. 

So, the short and skinny of my story. I used kratom everyday multiple times a day for 2 years, using between 50-100gpd towards the end. During the last couple weeks of me using, I had a seizure and had to go to the hospital. Shortly thereafter I went to detox, was sober for a couple weeks, relapsed, then decided to get on subs because i couldnt stand taking k anymore. I am currently on only 2mg suboxone a day and I am considering quitting it soon if my doctor agrees. 

Either way, this post is not about me at all, its about my wife. The last couple months of my use I had become a zombie and it totally put a strain on my marriage but deep down me and my wife still loved eachother. When I had my seizure, however, something snapped in my wifes brain. she was traumatized from seeing me have this seizure and just not taking care of myself the last 2 years. She helped arrange to get me into detox and wanted to help me. While I was in detox she went on vacay to mexico with her good friend because she had already planned it out months in advance and I was happy to see her go so she wasnt at home stressing out about me. When she came back from mexico a switch had flipped. she didnt want to be around me, she didnt want to talk to me, she stayed at a friends house for like 6 weeks, i barely saw her. Finally she came home and we started to talk again and whatever and also go to therapy. to make a long story short she cheated on me during those like 2 months with 6 different people. she was using sex as a coping mechanism. obviously i was destroyed by this news but stll willing to work shit out. we are going to couples therapy and still trying to work on things but she is still so fucked up. it doesnt feel like she loves me or wants anything to do with me. we dont have sex, and she spends the majority of the time we are together criticizing me or yellling at me. she is always ready for a fight even though it is almost never provoked. She has been a different person since this all happened and she doesnt know what she wants to do but it is not a good situation and all of my friends and family notice are very irritated by the way she treats me and them when we are together. I guess i am just writing this to hear if any of you guys had a similar experience or know about trauma and can help me better understand whats going on. I just need some answers..",2

2019-12-01 15:11:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/e4mw5i/the_medication_that_helped_me_quit_kratom/,THE MEDICATION THAT HELPED ME QUIT KRATOM,"Before I start this I just want to give my history. I have been addicted to kratom for two years now roughly, with the past year being the worst of it. I know there are many people that have been on higher doses than me, but for me I ended up at 80+ pills a day which amounts to roughly 40 grams of Kratom. That’s almost a bag per day where I live which is $40 a day. 

I got all of the typical withdrawals you get from opiates. The ones we all face when quitting higher doses of Kratom. EXTREME anxiety, irritability, and depression... Extreme restlessness, that feeling in your chest of needing to jump out of your own skin, the excessive sweating, insomnia... everything. I had ever symptom. It was awful. I was incredibly depressed knowing that I was destroying my life just because I was trying to avoid the withdrawals.

After failing to quit for over a year (I tried tapering and cold turkey many times) I finally said enough is enough. I reached out to my doctor and admitted to my issue. I spoke to him about my problem, all the sides, etc. Long story short, he prescribed me clonidine. He said they sometimes prescribe it to people that are trying to come off of heroin or prescription painkillers. It essentially blocks all adrenaline-induced side effects, which is pretty much everything I mentioned before that I was feeling when trying to quit. 

This stuff single-handedly changed my life. I am supposed to take it 3 to 4 times daily, but my doctor said I can also take it as needed and I can vary the dose depending on the severity of my withdrawals. 

What I ended up doing was taking it three times a day, and then at night I would take double the dose before bed. So that’s .2mg three times during the day and .4mg before bed. I would double the dose before bed because at night time I deliberately would not take my Kratom. The clonidine makes you sleep really well, so I would sleep through any potential withdrawal side effects. 

I was able to cut my Kratom dose in half the first week without feeling the awful sides. I did have some discomfort but it was peanuts in comparison to what I felt without clonidine. The best part is it’s not a controlled drug and doesn’t have the same dependency risk that comes with things like Suboxone. 

Fast forwarding only one month, I am now down to just 24 pills of Kratom per day and plan on halving that I’ve free next week. I am so so happy and so relieved that this stuff exists. I no longer feel like a failure, I no longer feel depressed and anxious. I have my life back. I have tears just writing this. I wanted to share this post because I know many people are struggling to find assistance in their tapers, so I just wanted to share what saved my life. Clonidine.

Bless every one of you that are trying to quit this stuff. We have been lied to on the severity of the withdrawal effects. I know many of us here didn’t realize what we were getting ourselves into. Do not feel like a failure, many of us truly did not know how strong a “natural herbal supplement” could have possibly been. I wish everyone the best in their fight. Please let me know if you give clonidine a try.


Edit: I should also mention, although this should go without saying, to stay away from ALL stimulants when trying to quit Kratom. I had to stop taking my adderall prescription (been on it for 11 years) during this process, and avoided all coffee and even things like chocolate that contain caffeine. It made this process even easier.",0

I was daily dosing at least 8-10GPD because I found a strain (brand) that really powered me up.    That increased to about 15-30GPD up until about a month ago.  I started to notice that my stomach was just having issues after issues, and I was tired of always thinking things like ""Oh I have a call with a customer, I need to take 2Grams now so I can be excited)"".   So I lowered back down to max 8-9GPD,  unfortunately, it wasn't a scheduled taper so I can't say how much each day I took but at least 5-6GPD.    

My plan was to take my last dose on Wed. because I was off Thanksgiving-Monday which would allow for any WD issues to hopefully calm down before then.   That did not happen, I dosed about 6Gs on Thursday and followed up with Friday as well :|. The rest of my supply (5g).    My last dose was 2G at 3pm (capsules) on Friday.

I did not get any supplements to use, I do have some benzos that I took to help with anxiety and some trees though.   I was able to sleep through last night without any issues at as of right now I'm at 38 hours.  I know I've only had 'bed time' once since I stopped..  My biggest worry was the sleeplessness and RLS.   The only thing that is bothering me now is my stomach, which was a problem when I was taking K as well. 

So what do you think, am I out of the weeds for acute?  I was expecting a sleepless night, but got in a good 7-8hrs. Hopefully, tonight that will stay the same as I have work tomorrow.  I can deal with the anxiety (Benzo low dosage until this is over) and stomach issues.   Just worried about RLS and Sleep.   


I did get my new spin bike in last night, so that will keep my legs busy.

You know that feeling when the nerves in your jaw go heywire after eating something sour or tart. Took an Emergen-c and oh boy that left me bent over clasping the sides of my face. It was almost unbearable lol 😂 Even regular food will trigger it. Does anyone else get this?",4
