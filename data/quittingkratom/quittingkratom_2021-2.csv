It was a great drug for me to use while getting off harder drugs and not being able to live fully sober, but after skipping a day and waking up in the middle of the night with a racing heart and RLS I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôve unwittingly become physically dependent. Also, I feel full of dread and can‚Äôt get out of bed and start the day without kratom, and I am also fatigued all the time, and I wonder it kratom use has caused this.

I have gone through cold turkey Xanax withdrawal and will never do a CT withdrawal again. How should I taper with kratom? Is it possible to it relatively painlessly? I take about 3 even doses in the evening.

Edit: I have a gabapentin prescription which I bet will help, but the night I skipped kratom and woke up with physical WD, I had taken a large dose of gabapentin that evening so I guess it won‚Äôt fix everything",1,0

I feel way better then I did on Day 2 and 3. Was able to leave the house to go on a nice hike and come home to clean my apartment. Also ate a normal meal AND took a normal poop. My first normal/healthy looking poop I've seen in 2 years. My stomach still gets a little bubbling throughout the day especially after eating. I still get a random moment where I just feel like complete crap, but it doesn't last too long and then I feel normal again.  


 But the **anxiety** has been rough. It seems my anxiety only shows up at night (right now). I find myself way more emotional about things then I ever have. I just feel depressed for no reason at all. Anyone have any advice for the waves of anxiety that come crashing hard?   


Other than that I believe from this point on it is all in my head. Physical symptoms are for the most part gone. I just got the mental part to deal with now.   


If you are reading this and are on Day 2 or Day 3, stay strong. I believe you are going through the worst of it right now. It will get better fast, and you will start waking up feeling much better.",9,0

I was having such a great day, feeling great, taper is going good. I was a little nervous because I was getting a filling at the dentist, and last visit for the diagnostic deal I was in a huge panic attack the whole time, but this time even though I was worried about it, I had already had a great morning, and then the appointment came and after a while I was like ""you know what, there's no panic attack, wow I can do this, so cool""

Then she numbed me... after a few minutes I couldnt' feel half my face, I don't know if my addict brain was associating the numb feeling with like a getting high kind of deal, but I slid right into a horrendous panic attack, started feeling lightheaded and nauseous. 

Then it went away for the most part, and I walk across the parking lot to the bank to deposit my check and my work's deposit, and I'm standing there and all of a sudden I start getting crazy light headed, super dizzy, my vision starts to blur with like colors and shit, I was freaking out, it's like my conciousness was leaving my body and I was looking down on it. Ringing in my ears too. And then I was certain I was going to pass out. I freaked out and asked for water, she says they can't anymore because of the restrictions, and I start freaking out more, thinking if I stay standing for one more second, I am going to pass out and end up on the floor... So I excuse myself and go sit down in the waiting room and do some Wim Hoff (through a fucking mask no less). Poor girl at the bank... Well anyways, I made it through, the light headedness went away, I was able to eventually drive home. But I really haven't felt as good as I did before the appointment since then...

Anyways, today is day four after the taper drop, and I am NOT feeling as shitty as the last fourth day. I have had some bad moments, bad thoughts, and panic attacks, but nothing like 6 days ago, so I'm going to keep up the taper, keep up the bike riding, keep up the new me. The old me would have taken a traumatic experience like that as an easy excuse to take a larger dose of kratom, not this time :) I'm seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and it's a long tunnel, but I'm not leaving it out of my sight :)",5,1

I am trying to get off a 2 year 30g/day addiction. 

Every time I take less I can not sleep and blah blah usual signs even with a taper. 

WHAT IF I cut my suboxone strip into 8 pieces and used it to bridge the kratom w/d for one week. 

Can I trick my body? Or are sub and kratom too similar I‚Äôll still feel extremely shitty after the suboxone? In my mind - while the kratom gets out of my system- I‚Äôll still have the suboxone to help cover that 7 days, then after the 7 days of sub I‚Äôll feel a bit down but it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm gonna feel negative effects from 7 days of sub, right? 

Does this make any sense? Is this classic addict nonsense?

I had got back into working out regularly for a few weeks prior to deciding to quit kratom CT last week, however I've been so fatigued and lethargic this past week, I just haven't been able to workout (or any other normal functioning). I tried to force myself to exercise a few days back but it was a pathetic,frustrating, and short lived attempt. Both my mind and body just basically said ""hell no"". 

Well this evening, though still not feeling too great, I decided to try to force the issue once again. I honestly was expecting a similar result as the prior time I tried earlier in the week, but low and behold I was able to get through the full routine, and at very close to my normal intensity. 

And the result- hello ENDORPHIN CITY!!! Jumped in the shower right after and realized this was easily the best I've felt all week. It was so awesome to just FEEL good again, if only for a short while. 

Going to try to get back at it daily, as I'm anticipating regular fitness is going to have to play a critical role in my recovery.

I know paws can last month's but I have been on such a low dose of kratom since October but have had no improvements.

I couldn't imagine having to redose inbetween the ceremony, being fogged out for one of the most important days of my life. And from a practical perspective, I couldn't afford the wedding I wanted with my addiction burning through every spare dollar I had. I was also procrastinating on major decisions, didnt finalize our wedding party till after I quit because it felt impossible.

I've traveled around the world with it, hiked the Appalachian trail with it, and it's the constant background powder of my whole existence--it dictates where I go, and for how long. Suffered from terrible constipation. Also delayed gastric emptying. And during the pandemic, that's all I did. Maintain my job as a doc that KNOWS BETTER, while drinking tea--sometimes cresting 50gpd.

I'm ready to quit. I have loperamide (since the GI is the worst), lorazepam, gabapentin, zofran for nausea and a Peleton to get on and workout even when I think I'd rather die. What I don't have is time off work, but today is the first cold turkey (already slight sweats since waking up). Wish me luck. I'm done. I know so much about addiction, I've always known better, and kratom gave me years of calm energy before becoming the drug addiction it always was.

Last dose 10pm, 2/26/2021. Hefty, probably around 11g.  Thanks for letting me check in daily,.

I have had a pretty hefty opiate(oxymorons) habit For several years and ended up getting a third DUI . I was so mad at myself I decided to quit doing opiates and start using Kratom for opiate withdrawal since I quit cold turkey and with no taper. I tell you what it did a miracle for me. After about a weka And a half I was totally done with any symptoms. I have been using liquid about three times a day for over a year which started to get a little pricey for me. I have to take some outpatient treatment program and they started to do urine tests. Both of my tests came up positive for methadone. I think it‚Äôs just crazy but it is what it is. My counselor had to upgrade me to a higher level of care and I had to sign a contract to quit doing Kratom. I‚Äôm glad to say that it‚Äôs now day seven and I feel pretty much normal. For first couple of days it was a little rough but not as painful as coming off of opiates . The first three days it was a little hard to sleep I had a runny nose and some diarrhea.

What a crazy trip it's been. Hours 16-48 have been pretty shitty.  I have a weird feeling like I took too much DXM (cough syrup). It's a very strange high, and my pupils are dilated. Hardly ate anything until today. Just drank water and pissed a lot. Only slept about 10 hours in 2 days, but I don't really feel tired. Just very anxious and lots of chest pains. Always cold too. Very depressed thinking about how I could do this to myself. I thought it was a good idea to take a few days off of work, but I'm thinking that work would've been perfect for keeping my mind off of how bad I felt. And also make time go by faster. But overall, this feels like the flu with anxiety/depression. That's it. Don't be afraid to quit.

One thing that keeps me motivated is that I believe the worst part is over. I am now on the downhill side of this crap, and everyday will be better than the last. Day 2 was definitely the hardest day for me. And right now I feel about the same as I did when I was tapering. I think if you took around the same dose as me, you would be waaaayy better off just going CT. Just prepare yourself for day 2 and 3. Also, it is sooooo nice to be able to wake up in the morning and not feel sick (like I need to hurry up and dose).

Day 4 starts in 2 hours for me. I'm so excited that I'm about to find out what being sober feels like. Been a zombie with no emotions for 3 years and it's had a negative effect on my relationship with my gf. Sex drive has been non-existent.

Whether w kratom, other substances, food, exercise, hobbies, social life etc. 

The nutritionist told me last month im obsessive. I took offense and thought she was way off. I can see what she meant now

When i started using kratom i didnt know how much to use. I saw forums that suggested a low amount at first. Of course i took double that. Didn't work so took more and more

Same w food. I have struggled w eating disorder and disordered eating. Over exercising. Felt ive had it in check. The nutritionist pointed out most people dont track every single vitamin and mineral and make sure they get üíØ of everything every single day plus dont go over the recommended amounts. I thought really?!

Between kratom and food and exercise i feel like thats what my life is. Its a freaking prison. One i made

I go through periods in my free time where all i do is read...this will last a few months...then i switch and its binge watching shows..few months later i play phone games non stop...

Yeah i guess shes right. Im obsessive. No balance

I want my life back. I guess im starting to see its not just kratom thats stealing my life. Tho it makes it so much easier to ignore the lack of balance in other areas

Ive gotten really into Wim Hoff the last few days. Its  been helping quite a bit. Its some crazy shit, Dude is pretty awesome. Its all backed by scientific evidence. And I know he has been practicing for 40 years. But read the book, watch some videos. We have the ability to control almost every aspect of our physiology. But we have to step out of our confort zones to begin. And lets face it, we probably wouldn't be in this situation if we didnt constantly seek comfort in drugs. Our ancestors didnt have much comfort. They didnt have a thermostat to turn up when they got cold, their energy was spent staying warm, cool, hunting, etc. We have lost that and are now stuck mostly in our heads. But we still share the same dna. You cant worry about much when you are immersed in cold, and its easy to make connections with your brain during breathing exercises.

Before you try this, PLEASE consult your Dr.

1. Talk to your Dr about getting Naltrexone. It is a godsend for me.

Naltrexone is an opioid blocker meaning that you can‚Äôt get high if you take Kratom.

It also quiets down that voice in your head. You know the one, the one that starts off saying ‚Äú let‚Äôs get Kratom, let‚Äôs get Kratom....GO GET KRATOM.‚Äù Instead that voice will say ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get Kratom ‚Äú followed by ‚Äú what‚Äôs the point, we can‚Äôt get high from it anyway.‚Äù And the voice goes away.

Now, I know it says you have to be clean for 12 days before you can start taking it but Kratom doesn‚Äôt show up on any drug tests that I know of.

Understand, if you take naltrexone and you have Kratom in your system, you‚Äôre going to go through a HEAVY,RAPID detox that isn‚Äôt pleasant by any means BUT it‚Äôs short lived.

The trick to starting your naltrexone treatment is to take the pill(s) as soon as you wake up, before you have a thought process. That way you can‚Äôt ‚Äúconveniently‚Äù miss a dose so you can take Kratom.

2. You may want to discuss with your dr about anti anxiety medications.

If you‚Äôve been using Kratom for a long time and quit , you may suffer crippling anxiety. I believe this is due to your subconscious freaking out because you can no longer get high. I was originally prescribed clonidine but it didn‚Äôt work so I‚Äôm now on Paxil .

3. If possible, get Xanax to help you sleep. The trick is to take it and go to bed early, before the restless leg syndrome kicks in.

I started this back in August and I have ZERO desire to use. There have been days where I‚Äôve forgotten to take my naltrexone and I‚Äôve had no cravings what so ever.",3,0

And once you make that decision to use it‚Äôs over, you‚Äôve lost the battle and you‚Äôve relapsed even before you ingest that nasty substance. So let‚Äôs think about this for a moment here. You use for years and years, your brain now expects to have this substance now in order to feel good, happy, normal, content. You have changed the physiology of the brain with abusing this drug. So now what? Well understanding the physiology of addiction and what‚Äôs going on in your head is the first step. Once you know what‚Äôs going on it‚Äôs easier to identify those cravings and attribute them to the addiction and recognize that they‚Äôre not real. So I noticed something, when I get cravings they stay in my head and won‚Äôt go away until I act on them, and once I make that mental decision to use or relapse, suddenly, even before I drive to the head shop and buy and ingest kratom I feel happy, I feel great! Because my brain knows it‚Äôs coming, because I‚Äôve made that choice in the mind. On the flip side, when I get cravings and I tell myself I‚Äôm not going to use, I get depressed because my brain now knows it‚Äôs not going to get what it expects and I feel like crap which often leads to relapse. So if there‚Äôs a method or way to trick your brain into thinking you‚Äôre gonna use without actually using that would be one way to help battle cravings. Hope this helps, the cravings are the hardest part of quitting bar none.",10,0

He does regenesis therapy as well which is like a healing practice that most people would think is kind of woo woo. But if I am spending that amount of money it would be dumb to use at the same time. It‚Äôs helping, he told me to journal everyday and that helps too. The first week is always the hardest then around 30 days gets tough too cuz you think you can reward yourself with using and be good but that just starts the cycle all over again and you end up using again for another year until you decide to quit again.

I know my usage here doesn't really line up with others in severity. I appreciate the kindness here. Background: Oxy fiend for about 9 years now. Started slow, then basically did 60-90mg a few days a week for a few years. Now my dealer is sporadic, so I only get 12-20 30s a month and blow through them in 3-5 days then go through Oxy WD.

Enter Kratom. Used it before, but never really used it often because it blocked Oxy's fun effects. But it helped the Oxy WD a lot.

Then life got boring so I've been slugging down 10-15 gpd for 2-3 months now with some breaks.

Today is Day 5 for me and physically I feel fine and the anxiety/depression comes and goes. The mental part is hard. 

What I am most curious about is PAWS as it pertains to Kratom. People here say that the true difficulty with Kratom WD is mainly on the tail end with the mental effects since it operates differently than traditional Opiates. For users with this dosing regiment, when did you feel 100% mentally?

Thanks!

(Also got in a bit of a rough patch with MDMA, doing it once a month from last summer till now. I think i'm okay there. Was hooked on Phenibut last November but luckily I'm 2 months clean from that and I don't think I have PAWS from that anymore!)",4,0

How did I let a substance take me down and hold me there for so long? I‚Äôm a 29-year-old father of a 1-year old boy, a husband, a business owner, and a religious man. Looking at my life there is absolutely no reason why I should be addicted to Kratom or anything for that matter. My life is great, my family is great, my finances are in great shape, everything is just as it should be. But why is it that I have spent the last 8 years of my life battling substance abuse to some form of opiate. I‚Äôve pondered this a lot over the last 7 agonizing days, and I‚Äôve came up with hundreds of ideas, all which pushed the blame away from myself. 
I‚Äôve always wanted to get to a place where I can look at someone with an addiction and tell them I know what its like because I‚Äôve been there, because I‚Äôve been through it, because I use to be like them. Then it hit me, I don‚Äôt understand an addict because I used to be like them. I understand an addict because I am like them. 
I‚Äôve spent the last 3 years before my kratom addiction sober from Oxy telling myself I‚Äôve beat addiction. That I don‚Äôt have to worry about that anymore, that it is a dark time but it‚Äôs in my past and over with. But somberly I‚Äôve come to realize that I will always have to worry about it, that I will always battle it. I battled opiates the better part of the last decade because I AM an addict.
I guess the truth about myself is that I‚Äôm a 29-year-old father of a beautiful 1-year old boy, husband to an amazing woman, owner of a successful business, God Fearing man, and an opiate addict.  
I know who I am, and I know how I got here and it‚Äôs my responsibility to get myself out.",42,0

This actually happened a few years ago maybe two days into my taper, but the pain was in a very different spot.

Post K I have my life back.  I am feeling really good in almost all areas in my life. üôè

While on K, I procrastinated and didn‚Äôt take care of myself and ignored a lot of shit such as dental pain!!!

So, today i went back to the dentist and had to have a molar pulled which sucked!  I hate being numb from novocaine and the dental assistant said caffeine takes the numbness away.  Now I am uncomfortable, can‚Äôt sleep and the pain is REAL!  I am taking 600 mg of ibuprofen and took Tylenol with it earlier which seemed to help.  I ran out of Tylenol and the ibuprofen alone is not helping as much.  I do have the option to take narcotics but I am too scared.  My tooth was infected and I think my teeth got really messed up by using Kratom. Even when I was taking it, I got my teeth cleaned at least every 6 months to a year.  I‚Äôve always had dental issues but I am convinced Kratom has made my teeth decay!  If there was ever a reason not to take this shit again, this is a consequence I could live without.  

The thought did cross my mind that I could go get a few tablets of K and feel better.  That is the insidiousness of this addiction.  

I am clearly sensitive to caffeine and am bummed that it‚Äôs 1:30 am and I am still awake.

I‚Äôm glad I got to post on here.  You have all been the reason I have had success.  

I shared that I had taken 2 k pills on 2/5 ( I think) that I felt super shitty after my 2nd dose of Covid vaccine and impulsively took them.  I have nothing in my house thank god!!

I hope by writing on here that I can handle tooth pain and the antibiotics will kick in and I will be just fine with ibuprofen and Tylenol which I will buy tomorrow.  I just want to be asleep already!!!!  I never used to care about that and now my good morning rituals are not going to be possible ( I run early in the morning) but can meditate and journal.  

Thanks for letting me dump all of this here!  I‚Äôll check in tomorrow.

Thank you all again!  This community has been amazing!  I go to a 12 step meeting but not a lot of people in there getting off of Kratom!

Good luck to all of you and good riddance to Kratom!

My thoughts are very often SUPER negative, with really nasty images of the world, myself, and my future constantly flying through my head. Is this just ""having anxiety""?

It seems to get worse every time I try to quit, like I have to dig myself out of a little bit deeper of a hole every time and rebuild my self.

I've tried to quit before but I only made it to day 2 before I just couldn't take it anymore I felt like I had one of the worst colds my stomach was hurting and the chills were fucking terrible. I've decided to taper and a couple days ago I decided to cut down to 7.5 teaspoons.

But I'm trying to ket my body adjust to it and get over feeling shitty for that hour or two before I redose.

It definitely was. But you know, I only had one panic attack. Sure it was a massive one, and really hard to get out of, but I'm learning more and more what I am up against. We all go through immense pain to get off this stuff, like everyone says, gotta pay the piper.

So keeping the xanax on hold again for when I really really need it, probably just weekends. That almost feels dangerously like a ""reward"" my brain is going to look forward to for making it through the week, but realistically, I woke up at 1:44 am this morning, not a whole lot I can do for the 7 hours before most places open... My addiction councelor says to find healthy habits to replace my unhealthy habits, go back out to the store, wash my car, bike ride, blah blah. I wasn't fully listening when he first said it, but now those are all a huge part of my life. I actually look forward to the bike ride, crave it actually. But like I said, up at 1:44am, and sitting on the couch is one of the worst things I can do for my anxiety, and sitting on the couch is pretty much all anyone can do that early.

But ya know, I had that horrible panic attack earlier, and my skin still feels like it's on fire, but I am noticing more and more sober moments that actually feel good, not good, pretty great actually. Like I am genuinely looking forward to whatever task I have next. I know I am still tapering, but these are extremely low doses for me and what I used to take, I haven't gotten ""high"" off of kratom in a long long time... These sober excitement/happiness moments are really shocking and a welcome sight!

I rapid tapered over 6 days. Rather agressive, but my idea was that I'd go through mini withdrawals during the day and take a large dose at night so I could sleep. This worked very, very well for me. To be clear, I was uncomfortable for about a 10 days. But much less so in day 7, the day after I quit, than on day 3, when I had about 5g.

I really didn't use a bunch of supplements. I exercised very hard throughout the day. I did lots of yard work, house work, and kept very busy. I barely had any idle time. I did take 5mg of mitrazapine at night the first few days to help with sleep, and 2.5mg of melatonin. It seemed to help. But, I was physically EXHAUSTED by the time I went to sleep, and generally I'd sleep at least 7 or 8 hours.

I'd wake up and feel OK the first few hours, then start to gradually feel shitty. Id exercise as soon as I felt awful. Then cold shower. Then eat. I'd feel better for a few more hours. When I felt crappy again, I'd do something physical like clean my garage or do yard work. Cold shower, then it's almost time for bed. Laundry, dinner, clean the kitchen, etc. Take my mitrazipine, take my kratom dose and go to bed.  If I felt restless, I used magnesium powder and honestly that really helped.

I went through about 3 weeks of PAWS depression. It was weird, honestly. I had weird, depressive, and exestnential angst I don't think I've ever experienced before. And, to put more stress on myself, I'm going through a divorce at the same time. So it's natural to feel depressed when your 10plus year marriage fails. So who knows if it was me just finally having feelings again or if it was real PAWS related depression. I'm much, much better now.

I can say the single most beneficial thing I've done during the whole process is exercise heavily. Hard, hard, hard exercise. It was a godsend.

Also, I think I hyped myself up about the withdrawals more than needed by reading some doom and gloom on this forum. Everyone has different experiences, but quite frankly, withdrawing from a habit always sucks. But it's manageable. Don't be afraid of it. Just do it and get it over with.

I got you right here, buddy."" Perhaps he sensed that I had just flushed my entire supply down a toilet not 2 weeks ago... or perhaps as soon as I leave, in their native tongue him and his coworkers laugh about another degenerate white boy who can't get through a day without eating a pound of crushed asian tree with a 600% retail markup....ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Long story made shorter, I told him im kicking that shit cause im slowly teetering over the edge of senility.

A real juxtaposition of mind fuckery. Here is a little life lesson from Mr. Mike to chew on your Thurs afternoon. If you set yourself to fail while in this delicate state of change, you probably will... lets hope this cbd brings some relief because I just rolled naked through broken glass to get it!

I have used kratom since Jan 2019 mostly with no issues, I didn't start using daily until about June 2019, I was able to maintain 15-20gpd for the first 2 years, but things really went downhill when I went on vacation for a week this past New Years. I always measured my doses with a scale but decided not to take a scale with me on my vacation(I guess to not look like an addict or something). That was a really bad decision. Once I returned and started measuring my doses again I had realized I was using around 30gpd, up to a max of 37.5gpd. I realized this was a huge issue and decided to try and taper back. However, something happened while trying to reduce my dosage. It was like a switch had flipped and there was no fixing it. Kratom just kind of turned on me the week before I ended up CT'ing. I started getting crazy anxiety and panic attacks that reminded me of when I was in the process of quitting drinking back in 2017. So I ended up trying to do a rapid taper for a week and ended up jumping the next Saturday. I did not plan on CT'ing but the Kratom forced my hand. Essentially I had reached a point where taking the Kratom gave worse effects then not taking it. I just couldn't do it anymore. Never felt that way until that last week, it was awful! So I jumped!

&#x200B;

The first 3.5 days were extremely rough, But I also was in WD during my week of rapid taper before CT. Akathisia and insomnia were my worse symptoms. I also had crazy brain zaps on day 1 and 2 as well as chills and sweats. Luckily I did not get any digestive issues, but had no appetite either. I had really considered going to a detox as WD's were almost unbearable, I really started to think I would not be able to do it on my own; not in terms of willpower, but just the shear intensity of the WD's. 

&#x200B;

I also found myself ruminating the same negative thoughts over and over with no relief. It was intense. I also had suicidal ideation, that I never would act on. Just crazy how effed up my headspace was those first few days.

&#x200B;

I ended up taking 3 days off of work. Day 4 was much better physically but thats when the Anxiety and Depression came roaring in. By about day 11 things started to settle down and I was able to enjoy music again like I used to. I am in no way 100% yet but each day seems a little better than the day before. I am able to get about 5-6hrs of broken sleep now which is a godsend. 

&#x200B;

I found this subreddit paramount to my success so far. I spend each day searching for example ""Day X CT"" and reading everyones reports on X day. It gave me so much hope.

Yesterday was the first day I had some energy/motivation.. but then last night I had horrible insomnia and it‚Äôs all gone again. 

I have this tingly cold sensation in my feet all the time too. Muscle spasms esp in the legs won‚Äôt go away. Wondering if that‚Äôs gabapentin wd and not Kratom? I did a short taper off 7 years of gabapentin a few weeks back.

28 year old male. 5 year user, 15-20GPD. Tapered to 1.2g daily and jumped. On day 19.

Past most of the physical symptoms (still low energy, sneezing, digestive issues), but other than that I am feeling much more stable mentally... when I‚Äôm not drinking.

My reason for posting this, is because I am beginning to notice that I am starting to use alcohol to ‚Äúfill the void‚Äù.

I have a great job in Commercial Lending, a beautiful, supportive girlfriend, I exercise 5x/weekly, eat good food, but I ‚Äúrang the bell‚Äù with Kratom for so long that I sort of feel... empty?... that I am now not using anymore. Enter alcohol.

This is obviously addictive behavior, and I‚Äôm just curious if any longer-term quitters ever experienced the need to ‚Äúfill the void‚Äù. I don‚Äôt like the feeling I get when I over-drink, and obviously the resulting hangovers are the worst. 

I haven‚Äôt gotten a DUI or done anything destructive thankfully, but the other night I drank a few strong IPAs and then got behind the wheel of my truck to go to the gas station for more beer. I feel so much shame and guilt because of it. Just some random weeknight, and I am getting drunk alone when I have to work the next morning. It was really pathetic.

I‚Äôve considered maybe switching to some nightly CBD use...

Any insight or advice would be much appreciated as I am obviously am not going to allow this to continue. But I am reaching out, needing some help from those who are wiser and further along than me.


Thank you.",4,0

First off, this forum has been huge for me in the early stages of quitting. Whenever, I get a strong craving, I go to this sub and it never fails to make me realize ""one more dose"" isn't worth it. To anyone reading, quitting is worth it, wherever you are in the process. I wanted to share my experience briefly and offer some tips that have helped me. I understand, my road has been relatively easy compared to other users, but I wanted to share what worked for me. I have gone CT a few times, but it did not work for me (for other CT might be the way to go).

I began using last March after a friend recommended k to me. I've struggled with drinking in the past and this seemed like a miracle drug at first. I was a daily user from the first time I tried k and preferred the whites and greens. It began once a day as a preworkout, then 2x a day, then every morning the second I woke up, then constantly/compulsively 4-5x/day...eventually to the point where I HAD to have k on me wherever I went just ""in case"". I then found the extracts and realized financially, mental health wise and physical health wise, I needed to stop. 

&#x200B;

I had lost 30 or so pounds in the past year (most of it in the first three months of use), had severe insomnia every single night and noticed some hair thinning: I just did not look and feel good anymore. People around me started to notice even though k seems so benign. I was 20-30 gpd for 11 months and preferred smaller ""stimulating"" doses through the course of the whole day. Mid-January I made a ""drastic"" cut from about 25gpd down to 12gpd using capsules for more accurate taper. Slowly, but surely I reduced the number of capsules and number of doses/day. First 3g 4x/day, then 3g 3x/day, etc., then down to twice a day and once a day until I was taking 1.2g mid afternoon in the last few days.  The taper from 12g to 1.2g took a little over a month. As time passed, I was less dose dependent and would realize ""Oh shit, I forgot to take kratom then."" Towards the end (two weeks ago tomorrow), I woke up hungover, caved, and took roughly 5g of Green (kratom is one of the best hangover ""cures"" I have ever come across).

&#x200B;

After I felt the familiar ""euphoria"", I felt terrible about caving this close to the end and flushed the remainder of the bag of capsules. When you are ready to make the jump, I find that getting rid of the supply is one of the best things you can do, not only for strong early cravings, but for the symbolism as well. I had experienced way worse acutes when I quit CT before and the worst has been night sweats, anxiety and insomnia with restless leg, but I know it's part of ""paying the price"". Below are some methods that have helped me in these early stages:

&#x200B;

1. Clonidine: easy script to get and helps with anxiety, blood pressure and restless legs
2. Wim Hof: I found this technique in this thread and it's been a life saver. I usually do this every morning and as needed for anxiety
3. Kachava: Not trying to solicit, but a plant-based ""superfood"" shake that keeps me full and full of nutrients
4. Vitamins/Supplements: I go Daily muti-vitamin, biotin (hair), fish oil, and Tumeric 
5. Excercise: It's been really important to tire myself during acute phase to help with insomnia. Also the endorphin release is great for the mood.
6. Modafinil: This is more of a slippery slope. I try to never go two days in a row and keep dosage low (typically half a 200mg Modalert or even a quarter), but good to combat lethargy when needed for work performance
7. Cold Showers: Sounds a bit silly, but helps get rid of gross night sweat feeling post wakeup and helps with energy boost.
8. Drawing/Writing/Creative Outlet: You'll probably ""feel"" a lot all at once upon quitting. For me drawing and writing have been a great way to unwind after a day of work.

This process has not been perfect (Nicotine and Alcohol, etc.), but as time passes it gets easier and pretty quickly you'll find that your brain becomes less dependent on kratom. The cravings are still strong, but think of the risk-benefit trade off. As time as passed, I have found myself more present and able to connect with people again finally. I know my situation was more mild than others, but I was able to recognize that I used kratom to feel more ""normal"" rather than ""high"" at a certain point and I knew something had to shift. The quitting process works differently for everyone, but slow taper was best for me. I tried CT, from about 15-20gpd both times, and would grit through 3-4 days of acutes, but caved and would justify this with, ""I know I can quit when I need to"" Stay strong everyone and be patient! Once again, the support in this thread has been a huge help for me.",8,0

Its like I stabilize for short periods of time and its a short lived reminder of why im putting myself through this quit. You know, i started doing drugs a long time ago because I was bored with feeling normal. I have been fucked up for soooo long now, that occasionally feelings of sobriety seem to have the same effect that getting high used to have. Its like feeling normal is such a foreign concept to me that being normal is like getting high. I know it wont last forever and at some point, i'll get used to sobriety and I'll once again get the urge to get fucked up so in no way am jerking myself off just yet. We got a long way to go still. For as vile of a substance Kratom is, (all opiates accually) theres still that very small glimmer of hope that presents itself every now and again.

Wasn't always that way today, but more often than not, which is more than I can say for the last week or 2. Went for a bike ride, beautiful day out, eating healthy still, drinking water, cutting back on coffee, took a brief nap (seriously helps so much)

Today was a little bit different, we had been tapering 1.4 gpd off every 5 days, but the last two days I tried skipping my morning dose, then realized that was a bad idea. Like I said before, that means I am going 12 hours and 20 minutes since my last dose the night before, it's basically cold turkey-ing every single day, and it sure feels that way. So I went back to taking my morning dose, which does technically bring the gpd back up, but today was a taper drop day anyways, so I'm still taking less than I was 3 days ago.

I did take a half a xanax like I said I wouldn't, that could be why I am feeling so much better today. I am going to try to not take it tomorrow and see if that's why. I realize the weight of what I'm about to say, but if taking a half a xanax each day will make me feel like this, and help me get through this taper, I will wholeheartedly do it through the taper off kratom, and then taper off of the xanax when I am finally off the kratom. I know everyone warns against benzos, and I experienced what those withdrawals are like, NOT fun. But there is zero chance my doctor will be willing to keep me on them (especially knowing my addictive personality), and will help me taper off of those as needed. I honestly only took it to help with taking that nap, not to chase the ""high"" that it definitely doesn't bring. I feel that nap is imperative to my mental health, being up since 2am does some rotten shit to my brain by the time the night is nigh...

Anyways, feel crummy for taking more xanax to try to help, but in generally good spirits. Had a pretty good mood most of the day, considering my day yesterday and the depression that sat on my soul, I'll take it :) Feeling good about my future being kratom free, or more accurately my future being withdrawal free. Fuck kratom, if I could cold turkey right now and not experience any withdrawals, I would flush our vast amounts left down the toilet before finishing typing this. Existential thoughts lately have been minimum, and that is a huge relief, they come up, but dissipate a lot quicker than they used to.

I wasn't doing a crazy amount (6-7gpd), but my body was definitely dependent on it. I would start feeling w/d symptoms in between doses so I knew I had a problem. I did what some would call a 'rapid taper'. Started on Friday of last week with my regular dose. Then dropped 2gs each day and here we are. The main w/d symptom for me is the anxiety. My heart is pounding and I can't seem to sit still. Slight flu-like symptoms but nothing crazy. Went on 2 drives. Took 3 showers. Paced around my apartment like an insane person just trying to do anything I can to make time go faster.   


I got really excited when I did the math and found out I was 24hrs in. That is a huge win for me, and I can't wait to get to the other side.

This is day 18 CT (3.5 yrs, 20+ gpd) for me. I'm remembering the half dozen or so times I've quit over the years. One time I was clean for two months. Boy am I wishing I stuck with it the first couple times around. 

Point being that the longer you use the harder it becomes to quit and the longer the recovery process. Exhibit A, if you will, the first time I quit for more than a week I was as happy as a clam and back to my normal self in no time at all. I actually felt more confident than I knew I could ever be. That was after one year of dosing daily with kratom. 

The next time the physical symptoms were a little worse but I felt better than I ever had once again. 

Now after three and a half years mostly spent high on kratom I would give anything to have that first or second quit with me now.

NEVER in my life have I been addicted to any kind of substance. I prided myself on being a runner and eating plant based. But one fateful day after a particularly stressful day after work my ex practically forced me to try this stuff. That night my anxiety lifted and it felt so uplifting and harmless. 

He was an old ex heroin user and never had problems recreationally dabbling. He was a high functioning addict the more I think about it. I don‚Äôt think he was sober more than a week or so at a time with me on either Xanax, alcohol, or heroin.  We are no longer together with kratom being one of the damning problems in our relationship. We basically became shut-ins doing kratom all weekend and not even having any type of intimacy anymore. Why would we, felt good without it..we talked of all these plans to travel and do things but ultimately we had nothing based outside of those hours of kratom use. 

I wouldn‚Äôt even touch a cigarette before this. Now I‚Äôm coping with this addiction and now addrrall on top of it because I needed something to offset the exhaustion to perform at work. I‚Äôm physically active even now and it reminds me that your body can create healthy dopamine and endorphins on its own.  I think if I wasn‚Äôt running and eating healthily I would have been forced to look this addiction in the eye a lot sooner, but all the drawbacks were shielded by the appearances. 

I am now numb to everything and every emotion. I randomly get a wave of feeling and it feels like it will crush me. I‚Äôve quit two times and the withdrawals were mild to awful. But I never stayed off more than a month and went straight back. This has been my longest stretch of use yet and I know my body is starting to show wear. I look tired all the time and I‚Äôm constantly exhausted. Now I have edema, ear issues, and constant nasal drip and yawns from a perpetual withdrawal (won‚Äôt take it at work). The past two quits I did CT. This time I‚Äôm doing a taper. It‚Äôs too mentally tough for me right now being alone and sad and to go through a full withdrawal. I have somehow managed to keep my life somewhat together but I don‚Äôt ever want to do anything anymore. A vacation sounds like a chore and how will I possibly hide my kratom from everyone always runs through my mind. 

I wish I‚Äôd never found this stuff. I was fine before it. And now I feel like I‚Äôve wasted years being cold and numb. But today is the first day of accountability. I‚Äôll keep a log of use (never measured ever) and start tapering once I get an idea of actual usage. I am guessing its 10-12 g a day and only in the evening. I‚Äôve followed this group for some time knowing I‚Äôd be reaching a limit at some point. It‚Äôs always been helpful seeing the positivity on the other side.

I used Kratom for a bit over a year, with 10-11 grams per day my peak, but much of that time at 5-6 a day.  I also had a one month break early on, and smaller breaks at other points.

I did a one week taper and quit 40 days ago.  Had minimal physical side effects, but really bad emotional deregulation in the 8-17 day window.  During the last 40 days I have used DXM 5 times to help with how I am feeling, but the last time is now 10 days ago, and it was not a ""tripping"" dose (150mg).  

I feel just awful, I have hot flashes all day, early morning awakenings, brain zaps (I haven't had this in 15 years, not since SSRI withdrawl), horrible fatigue, can't handle even tiny stressors, etc.

Could that really be PAWS?  Or is it more likely that is my baseline (or maybe DXM contributed a bit also).  My baseline was not good before Kratom, but not this bad.  I have read a lot of threads about PAWS, and how it can last months, but most people seem to have been on 30-60GPD.  Could PAWS really be this bad on day 40 when I was using 5-10GPD for a year?",3,0

This is the third time I‚Äôve tried to quit, I just had to get it done. Day 5 CT off everything. I was on around a 30gpd habit, and had too much issue weaning. I spent the last 5 months trying to figure out to get off it and felt so trapped. Tapering was too difficult and I felt just as awful on it than I did without it. I was just ready to be DONE. 

I am starting to think more positively, I‚Äôm telling myself that I am not broken, that I am resilient and that I will get through this. I don‚Äôt have regrets and I think I made the right choice.

Anyways, looks like things are looking up. I‚Äôm so glad this quit actually stuck. Ready to move forward with my life and get my inspiration, motivation and creativity back.

Muscle weakness - a cautionary tale,"I used kratom for about 4 years, between 6-10 g/day I'd guess. Starting early last year, I had some difficulty walking normally with my left leg side primarily, and went to my doctor. Long story short, I ended up at a Neurologist who after a couple MRIs, said he thought I might have ALS. What a shock! Any of you that don't know this, otherwise known as Lou Gehrigs disease, it's a 2-5 year death sentence, with you body gradually shutting down, usually death by eventual suffocation. He recommended a second opinion, and I went to best neurologist in my city, who after doing additional EMG tests thankfully disagreed with the diagnosis. He also did genetic testing, which eventually came back with a Sodium Channel deficiency gene disfunction. Sometimes this can cause Muscular Dystrophy, usually shown during childhood, but I'm in my 60s! However, he didn't think this explained my condition, and didn't know what it was. 

I mentioned my Kratom use, and if it might cause this effect, he didn't even know what it was! I had stopped Kratom cold turkey 2 months before, immediately after my initial diagnosis, and had already noticed a slight improvement in leg strength. That was about 6 months ago, and I've continued a slight improvement, walk now with a normal gait, but can't run. Also appear to have reduced blood circulation in my feet, they are always cold now in the winter. My theory is that Kratom caused this muscle destruction (as measured by elevated CK levels), and once muscle is dead, generally it doesn't come back. While this may be effected by my Sodium Channel gene, I suspect Kratom may cause symptoms like this in many peeps, particularly after many years of use and as they get older. 

Had I known any of this would happen, would have NEVER used Kratom! Again, I don't have conclusive proof that Kratom caused this, just that after I stopped my symptoms started getting better. However, some permanent damage appears to have been done. I hope this post might help some of you to who notice muscle issues not go as far as me before quitting Kratom!",8,0

so it has been 28 days since I quit CT from a pretty massive 5 year (40gpd) habit. Acute withdrawals are long gone but I am still extremely sluggish, unmotivated and outright lazy. Not depressed at all, thankfully, I feel very calm, almost serene, but sooooo lazy. Sometimes, I have to force myself with willpower to even do anything productive. After some shopping and some cleaning I am completely burned out and I need to rest for an hour. The kids already call me ""lazy daddy"", but family life is reasonably okay. 

Ironically, I know this state of mind very well, it feels exactly like amphetamine withdrawals. I used to have a very nasty dependence on street amphetamine for roughly two years. When I stopped, I was in the same condition. I felt calm, reasonably happy but was completely out of dopamine/noradrenaline for a few weeks. Kratom must have significant dopaminergic (or noradrenaline) action. When I withdrew from opium and AH7921 (strong opiates/opioid), I was severely ill for a week or two but felt pretty normal afterwards. Kratom WDs are a completely different beast. Acute WDs are no big deal but the lingering effects on brain chemistry turn it into a real problem. Small doses of bupropion (Dopamine and Noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor) reverse the lethargy quite efficiently, which clearly shows that it is indeed a lack of dopamine that affects me. The bupropion makes the insomnia worse, so I only use it occasionally to get some work done in my office. 

Well, anyways, I feel reasonably okay, and I am confident that I will overcome the lethargy in due time. I am trying to exercise but exercise is really a double edged sword. Half an hour of running is possible but I am completely destroyed afterwards. I feel like I have to pay for the two years that Kratom really made me motivated, productive, sometimes even somewhat manic.",13,0

It's been almost 6 mos, and I'm back to anywhere from 20 - 30 gpd. And, of course, having all the same nasty side effects and once again wanting to quit. (More about that in another post.)

I had a realization recently that I *think* has helped me and might help others. 

I used to think cravings had to be for a specific drug. I had pretty much 0 cravings for kratom the entire year I was kratom-free, so I thought I didn't have cravings at all. However, I would often have what I have come to call ""the need."" It's this sense that something is missing, a hole that needs to be filled. Sometimes it feels ravenous. Sometimes it's as though I'm hovering slightly above life but can't quite sink my teeth into it. Always, it sends me on a frantic quest to consume anything that might fill the hole and bring contentment. I understand now that this is exactly what a craving is. Whether it tells you specifically what it needs or not is beside the point.

These periods are quite distinct. Thankfully I don't always have them. They gradually occurred less and less frequently once I stopped kratom, but now that I'm back on, they're back with a vengeance. And taking kratom rarely satisfies the sensation anymore (though that doesn't stop me from trying). 

But the other day, I realized I'd been looking at this ""need"" the wrong way: *it's not an absence; it's a presence*. Because I sensed something was lacking, my automatic response was to find that thing. But no matter how many things I tried to consume, the sensation didn't go away. 

I've decided that rather than thinking something is missing, I need to acknowledge the presence of the sensation: ""Oh, hey, there it is. It's with me right now. I don't need to do anything about it. It'll go away on its own eventually."" Sure, it's uncomfortable, like a really annoying coworker who comes to job shadow you periodically. But it doesn't *require* any action on my part other than patient endurance. I don't need to go on a hunt to find the missing thing because *nothing is missing*.

This perspective shift is pretty new for me, so I can't really report on how effective it has been. But it feels important. Like it might be a first step.",33,0

I caved somewhat. I skipped my first morning dose for the second day in a row. I'll recap what that means for me, basically it means I go 12 hours and 20 minutes between my last dose from the previous day and the first of the next day. This, I am learning through experience, was a bad idea lol. Hit hard with withdrawals, sweating like I've never been before, astounding anxiety.. skin feeling like it's on fire, restlesness in the spine, supreme nausea, etc. 

Man I never thought I would say this, but I would almost rather have the extreme panic attacks I was having than this depression that just settled in. Wow I underestimated depression...

Well anyways I caved and took a half a xanax, I mean just for today. Honestly I only took it to get drowzy enough to be able to take a nap. The last two days I haven't been able to because my mind starts going crazy and I go into a panic attack. But with me being up at 2am every day now, taking a nap is essential. So the plan was to take a half a xanax after work, and then another half when I woke up. But I've said it before, I've no desire to get back into the xanax scene, so I didn't take the other half. It's been five days since I stopped taking them altogether from taking them every day for 29 days, so I think I'm good and won't go through withdrawals from just taking a half... I hope

So I don't know where I go from here. I may skip the morning dose again after all and tough it out, but more likely I will just go back to the taper plan, 7 doses a day every 2 hours and 20 min, dropping 1.4 gpd every 5 days. Tomorrow is our scheduled taper drop day anyways, so if I skip the morning dose, AND we drop every dose by .2 grams after that, and I react worse than today, that would be no good for me... then again, taking that morning dose dropped us down to 14.4 grams per day, an astonishing accomplishment in my mind... and before too long we're going to be skipping all doses that's the plan anyways, so I dunno... I just don't want to go too fast, like I said 12 hours is a LONG ass time to go between last and first dose... I mean I'm basically cold turkeying once a day every single day :( why oh why did I get involved in this drug..

But like I said, instead of taking the other half a Xanax I went out for a bike ride and lo and behold it made me feel better. Probably better than the xanax would have anyways, but I'm happy to have a stash even if it's only to help me fall asleep. I really feel like naps make infinitely more of a difference than xanax ever will.",0,0

You may or may not relate, but I‚Äôm sure someone will.

I‚Äôm not new to this, unfortunately. I‚Äôve been an addict for more than half of my entirely grown ass life. Which is sad. The only proud things I can say about drugs are I‚Äôve never shot anything up and also, I‚Äôm grateful for the many things I‚Äôve learned along the way. All of my experiences made me who I am today. That‚Äôs about where my pride ends. I‚Äôve been familiar with kratom for 10+ years. 

I recently saw a post about how you have to create new habits while off kratom, you cannot continue doing the things you used to do without causing unnecessary pain to yourself. I‚Äôm paraphrasing, but it‚Äôs very true. Shout out to whoever wrote that, you spoke directly to my heart and you were spot on. The biggest thing that has caught me up though, is instant gratification.

You have to look at it like instant gratification is no longer a thing. Instead, it‚Äôs something you work for. Want to feel better? Take a shower, clean up the clutter around your environment, etc. If you‚Äôre a musician, play some uninhibited tunes. It doesn‚Äôt even have to sound good. Yes, it‚Äôs a fleeting moment, but enough of those moments and you‚Äôre golden, kid. Feeling good about yourself and your choices actually feels really good, especially over time. 

More importantly though, you have to face all the reasons why you started using in the first place. Trust me, I know. I‚Äôve spent the past year learning how to let it go in a peaceful way. It comes down to: understanding it, forgiving others for their part, but most importantly - you need to forgive yourself. ‚ÄòTis a very hard thing. It‚Äôs something you have to learn, you can‚Äôt just will yourself to do it.

Express that shit. Cry it out, scream it out, silently stew in it if you‚Äôre an internalizer, go for a RUN. Whatever works for you, but fully feeling it in the moment is the best way to get it off your chest and off your mind. No, it‚Äôs not easy, and it is tempting to go after the instant gratification you know you can get right now, but this way is real and is actually healing you, not just masking the pain. Embracing your pain will eventually make it easier to cope with it. Super counterintuitive, but it‚Äôs true. 

I‚Äôm not claiming to have it all figured out, because my life is mos def a mess atm. I know it‚Äôs not easy to do that. You have to force yourself to do it. I just know, instant gratification is a fake thing. Not a real thing. And it will feel deeper and actually real when you earn it, no matter how small.

I‚Äôm in this with you guys. It‚Äôs been exactly a week for me at 4:45pm Central today. I hate my life right now. I have a lot of outside shit going on on top of my w/d, and I hate my SO, BUT love him so much and I just want to make sure I‚Äôm not just  ..w/d and being super irritable before I leave? Honestly, I‚Äôm pretty sure I don‚Äôt want this life so you never know. I came very close to leaving everything a couple of times yesterday. That was just yesterday. I‚Äôm mourning who I thought he was, I‚Äôve mentioned before that I‚Äôve had an absolute shit week last week, I literally have zero f‚Äôs to give anyone or anything right now, and I have a beer sitting in front of me, but I‚Äôm still undecided about it. The fact that I‚Äôm undecided about it means I‚Äôm growing and making progress. Yes, it‚Äôs a bad idea. It‚Äôs a better idea than kratom, though. Some things are harder to face and that‚Äôs okay, too. (That‚Äôs called giving myself some grace. I‚Äôm still undecided, if anyone‚Äôs curious.)

I‚Äôll leave you with this to remember: It doesn‚Äôt get easier. You just get stronger.

I feel  manic, like I took a low dose of adderall. I feel so cloudy in the head, but I am not sure if its brain fog, as I dont forget anything and I can also speak completly normal. Its like when you smoke weed and you are not high anymore and starting to get sober. I also feel sometimes pressure in my head and a clicking sound, when I go for a walk. I mean besides that its okay, of course their are bad days, but I also can enyoy alot of things again like laughing at a video. Like I mean real laughing, not kratom like, where you maybe grin a little. I mean laughing almost tears. I feel again the true emotions of life, its beatuiful. Music also sounds amazing. 

 But I just feel so weird in the head and I am extremely unprepared for this right now.  No one ever told me that. I researched alot about opiat withdrawal and my experience is just completly different, than a heroin or typical opiat withdrawal

168,2021-02-23 14:43:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/lqr437/my_kratom_experience/,My kratom experience,"Hey everyone,

I've posted here before and its helped me but unfortunately I just kept relapsing.  I wanted to just say that I'm getting back on track and excited to start day 1 again!  Last dose was last night around 11pm and I dumped the rest, so putting me around 16 hrs now free.  I apologize now because this is going to be pretty long winded.

Like many of us here, I'm an old opiate addict and I really should have known better than to try this stuff.  I started using last June and of course at first it was great.  I felt really good, it gave me energy and made me more social.  I was working a job I hated at the time and it seemed to make it a lot more tolerable.

Of course as we all know that doesn't last.  You start dosing more to try and keep the same effects and it slowly but surely starts doing the exact opposite.  It really ends up deteriorating my mental state - anxiety ramps up to terrible levels, and I think it even gave me a panic attack once.  I've never had a panic attack in my life and I'm generally a pretty easy going guy.  It also made me incredibly depressed and pretty much took away all motivation to do anything or accomplish anything.  I quit my job last August and I was initially excited to finally do a lot of stuff that I just hadn't had time to do having a full time job.  I did manage to do a couple things but ultimately I have nothing substantial to show for this time.  This is pretty much the opposite of me as I'm usually always planning trips, coming up with things to try, etc.

Well, it was bad last year but it really got worse this past winter.  I always get a mild SAD anyways and with the covid restrictions I basically kept using the kratom to cope.  I kept getting more and more depressed and anxious and since the kratom didn't really help (tbh it definitely made it worse) this ultimately led to a more serious relapse on fentanyl.  I haven't used any real opiates in over 7 years since getting clean and let me tell you the shit they have on the streets these days is like no dope I've ever seen - it's incredibly strong and since it doesn't last long, very fiendish with redosing.  I bought some last month and ended up ODing on my second use.  Since I was by myself I'm probably very lucky to be alive.

Well that was a shocking revelation and I stopped the fent right after that and got back on the kratom.  For a few days there I was really trying to work on sobriety but kratom just eventually has that way of making you not reach your goals.  Unfortunately, the fent plug I met lives right over by the kratom shop I've been going to and one day on the way there a couple saturday's past I caved and picked more up.  I went on a week long fent binge and was pretty much fucked up 24/7 and just unable to function much in general.  Towards the end I quickly saw where that was going and decided to tell someone and stop ASAP or I knew stuff would start going down hill extremely fast.

I dumped the rest of the fent this past friday night and jumped.  I'm not going to lie, its kind of been hell.  I actually picked up more kratom to help ease the WDs somewhat but to be honest it almost did nothing but provide slight relief even at gigantic doses and would only work for 2-3 hrs.  I haven't really slept at all in days so figured fuck it theres no better time to stop this shit than now.  When I was using the fent I didn't take any kratom, so I had a week off, then back on the last 3 days and probably went thru about 75g over that time.  So far I'm still feeling much better without and starting to get optimistic about the future again.  I'm hoping since it was a pretty short use and I've just been through hell, the rest won't be too bad.

Anyways, I'm not sure what the point of this post was other than to share my (terrible) experience and hope it helps someone.  I'm getting off this train for good.  I know I've got a lot to work on ahead of myself but I think I'm finally ready to do it.  Life is so much better outside of the fog and opioids are never sustainable to use.  As an addict I know that I just can't control myself with substances.  I thought kratom was mild and wouldn't be bad but yeah turns out I was wrong.",4,1

I've drastically cut my usage down from 1 kilo/month to 120g/month, and honestly I'm just sick of having to plan everything around it so I don't go into WDs around other people.  The last time I went to a girl's house I hid a bag of it in my pocket to toss & wash.

What I'm scared of is going back to what I was before: basically a zombie with no motivation who didn't care about anything and was just waiting to die.  I was drinking nearly every day for years on end, but within 2 weeks of starting kratom the desire to drink was straight up GONE.    Now I'll have a few beers on the weekend and have no cravings at all.  Not just that, but I went from barely passing college to getting a 3.6 in my final semester.  What scares me most is that people get anxiety/depression from PAWS for MONTHS after quitting.

Where we gonna go when the dam breaks loose

It'd be better for a few more days

But I'm tired and soakin' wet
And hunkered over trying to catch my breath
Broke my back and did my best
To hold you through the shakes

How can I get to the shore on time
If you won't keep afloat?
My heart was never much on games
Let alone the ones you play
I've only got one, and it's already broken
So why you wanna throw it around?
I wish I had the strength to go
But it's a long and hateful road
And I just now got to feelin' at home

Problem is I have a 12-14 hour job where I have to be on my feet all day, with little breaks, and where I absolutely have to talk and interact with people, something I didn‚Äôt feel like doing on any of my previous quits. Any advice on how to go about this? Most importantly, what can I do to just make it through the fatigue and make it through the day without raising suspicion about what I‚Äôm going through?

Any advice is appreciated! I‚Äôm not looking forward to this at all! My life at work and at home is stressful (hence the Kratom) but it just doesn‚Äôt work anymore. Thanks all!",2,0

I skipped my first morning dose this morning. I got extremely restless/itchy skin when it got close for my next dose, usually my second dose. Kind of not unusual, my most recent dose before it was 12 hours before... But for the most part it was fine, I was at work and distracted and I didn't go into a panic attack once. Then I took the dose and felt fantastic. Until about 1 hour 40 min later, crashed and started panicking. Took another dose at 2 hours 20 min after the first one, and felt great, then 1 hour later, terrible. This stuff is absolutely the devil. 

Got home and tried to take a nap, the second I laid down, that's when the carnival started kicking into high gear in my head, could not sleep to save my life. I just can't get these thoughts out of my head when I am idle. 

But no going back now. I keep having to ask myself ""was it REALLY worse than before"" it seems like every day I am saying THIS is the worst I have ever felt, no THIS.... \*sigh\* depression and anhedonia out the wazoo, anxiety through the roof, panic attacks like crazy, and just all around feeling extremely out of it all day.

But I made it. Every day I make it, and today is the utter lowest amount I have taken in years. 14.4 grams, down from 70 a few months ago! I struggle with this, we all do I know, but I really just want this shit to end... Can't tell if I am cutting back too fast on the taper, or if I am feeling like garbage because I am still taking the stuff at all.

I noticed my vaping has gone up quite a bit since I started tapering. I feel like I read somewhere on here that nicotine can make anxiety worse during withdrawals, is this true?

Side note: You guys ever do this while on kratom? Just wandering aimlessly like a zombie around in the world, and observing vast numbers of other people going about their days, including themselves in activities and hobbies, doing things with each other, socializing. And you're watching them thinking to yourself ""Wait, aren't I supposed to be doing all of that too?"" I feel like for the last 6 years I have watched the world go by me while I lay around doing nothing productive with my hobby-less, personality-free, kratom soaked life. :( I'm sticking with the taper, life is worth so much more than this dumb powder.",2,0

Please please read this one guys, won‚Äôt to make sure this wasn‚Äôt A fluke and I‚Äôm screwing myself.","So I‚Äôve been addicted to kratom for almost 5 years now. I‚Äôve tried to quit several times. Never made it past 2 to 3 weeks tops. 
Except this one time.... 
About nine months ago I got insanely sick. I had salmonella poisoning and I was hospitalized for four days. This was obviously unexpected so there was no taper or anything like that. While I was in the hospital I didn‚Äôt have any create Kratom for the entire four days. However I was on a morphine drip. Lol  
When I got home from the hospital they gave me 4 days worth of Oxy, and then 2 days worth of hydrocodone. I took that as prescribed shockingly and made it last all 6 days. 
Then I was out. I thought well expected to be slingshotted into withdrawals that were infinitely worse than I would‚Äôve had previously but I decided to just face it since I had made it almost 2 weeks without Kratom at this point. 
Here‚Äôs where it gets crazy‚Ä¶
I had zero withdrawals. None. I went almost 4 whole weeks without taking anything of any kind. I never got sick, I never had a runny nose, no sleepless nights, no depression of any kind, literally nothing. I felt perfect. I thought that I had developed enough self-control to be able to use again so I did for a little while and we all know where that goes so here I am now.

I have a decent medical knowledge so the best thing I could figure out was that I had swapped one opiate for another allowing my brain to get used to not having Kratom, but was not on anything else long enough to get addicted to that.

So fast forward to today. Today is day two of being cold turkey with K. However I had a Trumatic injury occurred today and I was prescribed 9x 10 mg OxyContin pills. 
I am going to make those last for seven days if possible. This whole time I will not be taking any K. This is my second run on this experiment. I will keep everyone posted. That being said I would love to hear anyone else‚Äôs advice, thoughts, or other experiences in the topic. This actually could be helpful for us to know if it works the same way it did last time.

I never would have touched it if I even had the slightest idea that this stuff would create a physical dependence. 

Nothing i was dealing with before, was ever as bad, as trying to stop taking Kratom. It's made my anxiety worse, my depression worse, my skin looks like shit and I'm rail thin, and the withdrawal is comparable to pills like Oxy, from what I've been reading. Talked to a friend of mine that has had ongoing issues with heroin and benzos thru their life and said that what I described feeling was a mild, but very very similar set of symptoms.

I started like many people on here thinking that Kratom wasn‚Äôt a big deal. That it was as addictive as coffee and would be easy to stop. I started doing just a small amount per day. Just once a day, then a few times a day, and eventually I was doing big scoops every few hours for about a year. I don‚Äôt know how much I was doing at my worst but I knew I had a problem when I tried to stop cold turkey and I literally couldn‚Äôt. My legs wanted to shake so bad I was punching them when I was in bed out of pure frustration. Eventually, I found this Reddit and I came here for motivation often. The tapering guide on here is very good and I used it as a guide on how to do my taper. After a little experimenting I found that doing 3 teaspoons 3 times a day was a good starting point for me. It was enough for me to feel normal. Many people on here recommend using a scale to more accurately measure your doses but I did not find it necessary. As long as you‚Äôre not loading up heaping teaspoons that are packed you‚Äôll be fine. Just be honest with yourself. If you think you won‚Äôt be able to trust yourself, just get the scale they‚Äôre not expensive. 1 teaspoon is about 2.5 grams. I stayed on 3 teaspoons 3 times a day for 5 days. I used magnesium and L-theanine in the morning and melatonin and valerian root at night to sleep. I then dropped 1 teaspoon every 5 days. I would typically drop the middle dose first, then the first dose, and then the last dose just to make it easier to sleep. At some point, I had to go to 4 doses per day because I had such a long day and the doses were getting smaller and smaller. If you don‚Äôt have to, I wouldn‚Äôt go to 4 doses per day. Try and stay on 3. Once I got to 1 teaspoon 4 times a day, I dropped 1/2 teaspoon every 5-7 days. Then when I got to 1/2 teaspoon 4 times a day, I dropped 1/4 teaspoon every 5-7 days. When I got to 1/4 teaspoon twice a day, I finally jumped. It wasn‚Äôt too bad after that. I still felt irritable, anxious, and had small headaches for a few days but as time went on it got better and better. Its now been about three weeks since I last dosed and I think I‚Äôm mostly back to normal. Don‚Äôt give up. If you slip a little, don‚Äôt think all your progress is ruined. Just go back to your schedule and try and stick to it. I slipped a few times, it happens. If you can, work out every day. Run often. You‚Äôll feel better afterwards. Once you jump, never ever go back. Don‚Äôt let your mind convince you that you can do a little here and there without consequence. It‚Äôs not worth it. It‚Äôs a short lived high with a quick comedown and terrible withdrawals. I believe in you. You got this.",49,0

Like I'm sure most of you've also felt, I thought I'd found a miracle cure in Kratom. Of course, that shit was too good to be true, but I was too hooked to notice. I never *really* stopped drinking but it definitely took the backseat, at least early on. Two years down the line, and I've now been clean for nearly a month. It might sound like I took a high dose, but I never did. I made sure to stick to around 4-6 gpd, and I stayed there for those two years. The quitting part was actually pretty smooth (if anyone here is taking a similarly low dose of Kratom and is worried about any eventual side-effects, there's nothing for you to worry about). But three weeks down the line, and my alcohol and other substance consumption have reached a new high.

I know it's probably a matter of me having lousy self-control, but I guess I'm just asking for words of support from somebody going through this as well. I'd rather not return to Kratom as I've felt massive improvements in my creativity, emotional variety (if there is such a thing lol), and overall happiness. But I can see myself crawling back to it some day to get out of this sucky booze spiral.

Guessing somewhere between 35-55 gpd most days.  

Tapered down to 14 gpd and decided I need to just get it over with.  Got a week before starting a new job and want to use this time to get over it for good.  

Plan on also abstaining from alcohol, caffeine (mostly, way less than normal) nicotine and also doing a fast with just water, electrolytes, lemon juice and apple cider vinegar.  I have experience with this and I‚Äôm a big believer in fasting occasionally for health.  Last time I went 5 days and I did use K however I needed way less and it lasted longer so I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôll speed up the recovery

Got to the point where I‚Äôm just literally useless without my morning pot of coffee, big dose of K and even then it takes me so long to get going, so I never get anything done before work. I work evenings. Lucky if I get to the gym , or take care of errands.  Lots of procrastination and I completely stopped writing music which was something I was obsessed with before.  
Already feel the desire coming back on day 1 here.  Plus I feel like my drinking has gotten worse on it.  I think the alcohol sort of brings some emotion and light back in where K has blunted it, but at a cost. 

Feel like it‚Äôs going to be like an exorcism ceasing everything at once but I think it‚Äôll be worth it.

A little advice, if you‚Äôre doing the same exact things you were doing on kratom, then that is a big part of the problem.","When I planned my taper I reached out to a buddy of mine who also wanted to change some of his habits and start new better ones, ie. Exercising, eating better, start calling family out of the blue for no reason if you‚Äôve been isolated, try new things, etc. 

When I started my taper, on the same day, me and my buddy woke up early and went for a run, then came back to my place and both had coffee and meditated and just talked until he had to go to work. I also started making fruit smoothies in the mornings for after runs to start helping my gut out along with drinking tea with honey, ACV, turmeric, and cinnamon, along with a high dose of cbd mixed in as well. 

I started cleaning a lot more regularly, makin my bed in the mornings, doing dishes more than once a week, cleaning bathrooms, etc. whatever i felt needed to be done more often. 

We started doing more things as well like going on hikes or just walking around town, longboarding, pretty much just hanging out. 

I was a very isolated person, and didn‚Äôt like being around people and also family, I had no friends really, and I was lucky that someone wanted to change with me, it has helped a lot. Even though he wasn‚Äôt addicted to kratom like I was there were things he wanted to change in his life. 

So I know some of you may not have someone to do it with, but my advice is is to find a way to start changing your life, even little things help, because if you just keep doing the same things that you were doing while on kratom then it‚Äôs going to seem a lot harder to move on. And the way I see that is because if you develop habits WITHOUT kratom, you wont relate those habits with taking kratom, get what I‚Äôm saying? 

It isn‚Äôt easy either way, but it will help you move on faster if you start trying to do new things and develop better habits.

I have problems with insulin resistance now, it looks like kratom can be a precursor to diabetes.

My stomach still blows up and my body does not know how to handle water almost every day. The chest pain and electrocuting fingers and toes never went away. Acne went from severe to mildly severe, didn't go away. My hair stayed permanently altered, I am afraid I may be going bald.

There's a reason that kratom is a gas station drug like spice and other disgusting substances lacking class and data and regulation. It's a fucking test put there to see if you're curious enough to permanently ruin your life. I'm venting and it's not everybody's experience but come on, it's so fucking stupid.

Well I think I can say now that my RLS has stopped. It has been 3 nights now and my legs are back to normal.  Thank God that was one of the worst withdrawal effects I had to overcome.  Also starting to get my sexual desires back. I am also starting to get my feelings back which I have missed so much for the past 4 years.  I can now listen to a song and feel it again. Hubby says there is life in my eyes again. My face looks younger more relaxed and healthier than it has in 4 years.  Still not the new me yet. I am still dealing with my intestines but think I found what is causing that.  So we will see the next few days.  I am going to make a schedule and start my stretching and exercising so I can deal with the pain that I started Kratom for.  I truly believe mental, spiritual work, diet, and exercise are the total picture of how to live your best life.  I follow a great woman Louise Hay her book and CD's on ""How to heal your life"". She cured herself of cancer twice. Without medical intervention. She lived into her 90's. So now that the worst is over I am going to start my journey to try and get as well as possible, as pain-free as possible and to look and feel my best yet.  This is all I can do now and I want to share my journey with you. I am putting it all in my book that I am writing but that will be like the last few chapters.  I know everyone is doing the best they can do today. It is a journey remember that. There is no end just a journey with lots of hills, valleys, mountains, seashores, moonlit nights, lots of surprises and blessings. We can do this go for your best life yet.",8,0

Have suffered through countless detoxes and somehow end up back on it. It blows my mind as I've suffered through heroin and suboxone withdrawal and now I find myself trying to get off kratom. I very nearly threw in the towel and got back on subs a couple weeks ago. Realizing I need to step it up, so I got a ""peer counselor"" through this recovery place to talk to and stay accountable with. Have been doing NA meetings on zoom and looking into getting some sliding scale acupuncture. Forcing myself to meditate - very difficult to sit for even 10 minutes. I see a doctor on the 26th and will hopefully get something to help me sleep a bit as the insomnia breaks me after about 6 days. Got some cannabis set aside for the detox which does help me. Part of me knows this is simple - just stop taking it. But that isn't working so guess I need some tools and support. I imagine this is really difficult as my history of opioid addiction runs deep. At least I haven't done any of that in quite a long time, but the kratom has all the hallmarks of opiate addiction and it sucks. The kratom keeps me from withdrawal but just makes me feel weird and off now - makes me kind of mean too. Anyways I guess it helps just writing this stuff out, putting it out there, thanks",4,0

Even when you feel like a fucking alien on a strange planet not suited for your species, you remember that it will pass. When its 2 degrees out and your shivering and  sweating through your 5th set of underwear by 1pm, you remember it will pass. When your digging through a locked dumpster in back of Aldi because thats where you threw away the rest of your supply the night before, thinking your going to beat this this thing NOW, and your local K shop doesn't open till 11am, you remember this will pass. When your wife has been in labor for 28 hrs and she gets rushed to an emergency C-section but instead of gowning and masking up, your out in the parking lot dosing up like a true asshole, you remember this will pass. When panic attacks hit you so hard you find yourself at the med center for the 3rd time in 2 weeks, while your wife and NEW BORN baby are sitting in the waiting area at 2am, probably wondering what they have done to deserve this, you remember it will pass. When you make your wife think your upset with her just so you have an excuse to sleep on the couch, so she doesn't wonder why your sneaking downstairs to dose up in the middle of the night when you wake up shaking like a fucking crack head, you remember this will pass. When your 5 yr old son wants to show you what he built with the lego set he got for xmas, but he can't cause your sitting on a 5 gal bucket crying in the shower for the afternoon, you remember this will pass....

When you discovered Kratom for the first time and that virgin burn latches onto those receptors flooding your brain with great feelings that you didn't do anything to earn, and you wonder where this has been all your life..... you need to remember that its not real and it too shall pass....

I've just decided to view it as a lesson. My first week CT I was working out a ton, not drinking nearly as much, and just taking better care of myself in general. I can definitely recall feeling better for having been disciplined in those manners. 

I know how to do this and i know I have the discipline to do all those little things that make you feel healthy. I treated myself to a gym membership as well. It will get me out of the house and force me to focus on bettering myself instead of the possibility of being distracted at home. And I can workout with my buddy as well. 

I've also decided to cut out supplements this week just in case anything is holding me back. I've been taking NAC, Vitamin C, and Ashwagandha.

I originally started taking kratom thinking it would help me to socialize because I've always struggled with that. After a few months of using, it became clear that kratom wasn't the miraculous plant I originally thought it was, but I kept taking it to avoid the withdrawal symptoms. Over the years my addiction to kratom has done much more harm to my social life than I could have done without it. It didn't take too long for me to start avoiding going out because kratom made me sweat a lot as a side effect, and I was always worried about timing my day around my next dose. I pretty much leave the house for 45 minutes 2 or 3 times a week these days, and that was just because I needed more kratom. If that wasn't enough of a reason to get my ass into gear and quit kratom, the ridiculous amount of money I've spent on it over the years was another good motivator.

Out of all the substances I've quit taking in my life, kratom has been the roughest. In the first 3-4 days I was getting through it by taking mental note of every few hours that passed, and I'd congratulate myself for it. Then I'd use that feeling as motivation to help get through the next few hours. The nights were particularly hard until 5 days had passed. Extreme hot and cold flashes, severe anxiety, muscle pain, restless leg syndrome which isn't at all limited to just your legs, etc. And when I finally did get to sleep, I'd wake up an hour later just to have to start all over again on going to sleep under those conditions.

At this point I'm feeling much better than I was a few days ago. I still have pretty severe fatigue and some anxiety, but most of the physical symptoms have dimished a lot. At this point I'm starting to try and prepare myself for the possibility of a long PAWS period. I'm hopeful that it won't be bad but considering I've dealt with depression and anxiety all my life, I think I need to be as prepared for it as I can. I've lurked on this subreddit a few times over the past year, but now that I've made some significant progress on quitting my kratom habbit, I plan to be a bit more active about interacting with you guys and girls who are going through the same thing as me.

To finish off this wall of text, I just want to thank the people on this subreddit who help other people understand what to expect during all of this and cheer them on while they're fighting their addiction. It has helped me a lot to be able to visualize a timeline of how things will be for me, and see each step forward on that timeline as a goal to reach.

I can barely hold a conversation with someone without just spacing out every couple minutes. I feel like my brain is not what it used to be, and focusing on schoolwork is very difficult. It's gotten so bad that I've started having suicidal thoughts even when I'm high, something that used to never happen. I don't have anyone to talk to about this as I've hidden this addiction from my friends and family b/c I didn't want people worried about me. Some of them are starting to notice I'm not quite the same. I just wanna get off this stuff so I can properly deal with my mental illness. These withdrawals are something else. For me, the worst part is just the emptiness you feel. I don't even feel human when I don't have kratom. My last dose was about 12 hours ago, and Im hoping it is my last.

It‚Äôs a momentary reprieve (much like Kratom use in general) but it was enough to leave me feeling like I both made and lost a great friend every night. 

No clue when it happened exactly, but at some point those dreams started coming around less and less, until it got to the point where when I actually *did* have access to that rare moment of humanity, it was enough to leave me crying when I‚Äôd wake up at the crack of dawn. 

It took me a while to realize how absolutely fucked it was for something so normal, so inherently present in our regular lives, to become a goldmine like that. Dreams were a break from the mess I was in, but even moreso a reminder of the person that I‚Äôve been living without. I‚Äôd be left thinking why? Where? When the absolute hell did I let myself lose my entire self, and how can I bring that person back?

And then it happened. February 18th was my dad‚Äôs birthday, and also the 2nd anniversary of his death. Now I don‚Äôt think I ever really grieved, (or even realistically could in a way that was equal to the love I had for my best friend and mentor) but after months of nothing, I finally had another dream. 

It‚Äôs a blur and I don‚Äôt remember very much, but close to the end I was hanging off a cliff‚Äî half terrified of losing my life, half relieved that it might finally be over. Eventually I decided that yup‚Äî I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm so fucking tired and scared, and it was time to let go. And right when I did, a hand reached out from over the edge and grabbed mine, and halfway through I realized I was scrambling and trying to climb up. I still wanted to be here. I still wanted to try.

When I finally got up, I saw my dad crying and giving me a hug I never thought I‚Äôd feel again. The only thing I remember after was hearing ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not letting go. You‚Äôre almost there.‚Äù

Today I‚Äôm down from 40 GPD, to 15 GPD using stem and vein. I have an appointment to get Gabapentin to help rapid taper even faster. Something just finally clicked, and those dreaded withdrawals have now become a source of excitement‚Äî a sign that I‚Äôm finally coming home.

And more than anything, I‚Äôm not letting go anymore.
I‚Äôm taking those dreams out of my head and back into the world where they‚Äôve always belonged. And to wherever my dad is now: thank you.

I was happy about that, and in a relatively good mood, my head was pounding, but that's every morning... I felt good, and then I took my first dose and lay on the couch. After a while, I started feeling anxiety, panic attacks, existential thoughts all over again. I really think I need to try to skip my morning dose, I feel I don't even need it some mornings. I can't help but wonder if I am feeling so shitty because I am still taking this stuff at all... I know I said that before, but I just dunno... The last time I tried to skip a morning dose I freaked out thinking I made the wrong decision and ended up taking one.

I see a lot of people saying they prefer tapering because it keeps the withdrawals minimal. True, I have very few physical withdrawal symptoms to begin with, but I am devastated by these panic attacks. I took the xanax for 29 days to try to alleviate them, and maybe I am still somewhat withdrawing from those, I have only been off of them for 3 days... But people give the impression that tapering is the way to go because it keeps you feeling more normal than a couple horrific weeks. I have never felt less normal, and the only thing that hasn't changed other than our absolutely tiny drops is that I am still taking the damn kratom.

I also see lots of people on here who have taken kratom for many years and then decide to quick because it started causing them to have horrible intrusive thoughts, anxiety, and panic attakcs, exactly like me. In fact that's what started this whole thing, I would have a panic attack on my crazy high doses and then cut back because I thought I was taking too much... that sort of further supports my theory that my body is rejecting this stuff.

Someone had commented before saying I should commit to one day of not taking it, but I have been too terrified to try. If our original assumption was correct that I am super sensitive to these dose drops, skipping an entire day would destroy me. Or maybe not, I just don't want to gamble at it and be wrong. But then again we had dropped to less than half of my massive amount way way quick, and it didn't feel like this. I had horrible panic attacks yes, but my face didn't feel like it was on fire every second of the day.. or maybe that was because my body still had so much kratom saturated in it. So many variables...

People talk about relapsing, or in my case going back up in dose because they can't handle the withdrawals. I CAN'T go back up in dose, even if I wanted to, I feel just as shitty if not worse, I've tried it.

I am a seasoned drug addict and alcoholic. I‚Äôm not proud of it but I feel like it should be known for the post. I‚Äôve been abusing my body for the past 10 years. I was recently sober for 2 years but had a relapse and fell right back into my addiction. It all started with kratom. I realized I couldn‚Äôt stop without horrendous withdrawal that would make me too uncomfortable to even go to work. So I decided to take suboxone. Well I did that for a good 5 months or so but eventually I wanted to stop. I had the brilliant idea of taking kratom for a few days to ease the withdrawal. So fast forward I‚Äôm into daily kratom use once again and it‚Äôs been 2 months. I‚Äôve quit the suboxone but I‚Äôm back on the kratom (what I originally went on the subs for) I‚Äôve tried to quit multiple times but keep relapsing due to the withdrawals. I‚Äôm so beaten down from it. In my personal opinion kratom is the worst withdrawal I‚Äôve ever gone threw. And I‚Äôve been addicted to heroin, alcohol, benzos and meth. I didn‚Äôt even think of it as a drug when I first started taking it. I am clean from all other substances but the kratom and I so badly want to be free of it. I can‚Äôt seem to make it past day 2. The back pain, sweats and anxiety always get the best of me. I‚Äôm beginning  a taper to see if it will work that way. Because CT doesn‚Äôt seem to work for me. Anyway wish me luck!

First off, I got hooked after being told it was a ""plant"" and nothing more. Well, from the age of 18 until 22 I kept using and my dosage bumped up to 50g/daily. When I ct it, I was at 20mg/daily.

My symptoms included: Runny nose, diarrhea, tremors, sleeping-difficulties, freezing body temperature, and heat flashes. Let me break it down for yall.

Day one was the roughest: I was covered up in my bed with a sweatshirt shivering and twitching from how cold I was. I fought through it and didn't sleep at all. The next day wasn't bad, just twitches and the shits. The third day my symptoms escalated ten-fold, I was aching and I couldn't focus. By day 5 I felt 85% normal granted I went through the hardest part. So far, I am still having cold chills and dizziness/flu-like symptoms. If you can get to day 5, it'll mostly be psychological.

My anxiety is  killing me, just about freaked out at the grocery store and almost had to leave.  Most of the acutes were very manageable though. Especially compared to multi substance, benzo & suboxone ct w/d. That shit almost killed me. Didnt sleep a wink for 2 weeks, couldnt eat, and the absolute worst, nightmarish symptoms. E.r twice.. please dont use subs, not worth it, not for kratom. That's like smoking crack to get off coffee. Of course big pharma and addiction doctors wont tell you that.... Anyway  that was a long time ago.  Having put myself through it though, imo makes any w/d much worse. The hardest part for now was actually  getting myself to jump off, I was scared for no reason. It just delayed the inevitable. I hope anyone with a history of substance abuse that is trying to quit kratom can take solace in the fact that kratom w/d isnt that horrible, comparatively. Cant say the same for the mental aspects. But I think they can be mitigated. Not that im having much luck atm. It could always be worse! 
One reason I think kratom is so tough for me is that its so easy to get. Luckily its mostly junk thats available locally. Literally $1 per gram of shit. I was paying roughly 10 cents a gram for standardized powder. Which was still shit because the alkaloids and toxins really built up and totally fucked me. Ive thought many times of hopping in the car and grabbing some. I actually did on superbowl Sunday thinking it would take the pain away. Nope, was just shitty and Im actually glad I showed myself that. In the oxy and dope days I probably withdrew 2 or 3 times a month.  Just based on availability and price..
One thing I have learned through all this, Almost every one of us is grasping for some miracle cure, but in my mind we are just trying to replace one drug with another. I think that the small amount of releif is negligible and the only cure all is time. Certain things are fine, but I feel anything that will alter my brain chemistry is counterproductive at this point. I tried almost everything you will read about on here. The only thing that helped was clonidine. It kept me very slightly less agitated. But guess what,  I ran out and things got worse.  At this point I would have put myself through twice the pain to expedite getting well.  Something maybe you should consider.  Im basically just rambling,  trying to distract myself from the current situation Im in. My brain isnt very sharp yet, Im dysphoric, achey, anxious and not in the best of spirits.
Still determined to stay quit and hopefully I will get rewarded for my efforts at some point. Im just glad its winter, I had to quit because my body became overly toxic and if it was any other time of year i would have lost a $80k a year job. So thats something good . Everything happens for a reason.  I really hope things will get better soon.  Just gotta keep fighting.  Ive always been strong and a fighter.  So this is no time to puss out. I just hope I can manage the anxiety attacks.  Haven't figured out how to win that fight. Although I have a long history of getting knocked down before I get up and kick ass.",5,0

The sober feeling is way better than the ""high"" of sustained use. (5 years use, 3 years daily use). Being sober actually *feels* better as a state of mind/being.","I'm finally phenibut and kratom free, over my unusually short withdrawal period, and it feels like my soul has returned. my life is back, my motivation is back, me desire to DO SOMETHING is back, I feel nostalgic, like I did when I was a young kid in college full of optimism for what my life had in store. Strangely enough my body feels better, my vision feels better, and my head feels better as well. I feel ""sharp,"" and my personality, my interests, my sense of humor, and my mood are all way more consistent. I feel like a grown ass man, someone able to take life by the horns.

My self confidence and self esteem is amazing right now. Not in a manic sense, not like I'm on a drug, I just feel like an ""equal"" to others, like I have worth. Like I can enter into a room and belong, take a job a belong, speek up in a meeting, etc.

I started taking phenibut about 7 years ago, in fact I feel like I was partly responsible for the phenibut craze because I basically evangelized it on a certain forum (before reddit). Phenibut was initially a life-saver, literally, it gave me the confidence to come out of my shell, make freinds, date, have sex, go out to bars, clubs, events, and social functions. using phenibut strategically allowed me to ""reprogram"" myself into a better more confident person. It took me really far in life. Eventually I started using it every Fri and Sat, and after a few weeks the withdrawals would last from Sunday until I re-dosed on friday. During that period I assumed my increased anxiety, depression, sweating, etc, was my ""baseline"", but no, it was phenibut withdrawals.

The worst thing happened when I had a HUGE negative live event(s) that pushed me to start dosing phenibut every single day for almost 3 years, which put me at this year. I took phenibut and kratom daily because I could not handle the massive anxiety and depression that i was going through, couldn't perform my job on w/d's, and couldn't maintain my relationship with my gf if w/d'ing. So phenibut and kratom became daily. 20g of Phenibut per day and 60+ gpd of Kratom.

What Phenibut and Kratom did to me:

My baseline dose of phenibut and kratom was simply to keep me from withdrawing, I wasn't even getting a real high, but I damn sure was experiencing really negative physical, mental, and emotional consequences from using them. They creeped up on me slowly, became so pervasive that I thought it was normal. It was just ""who I am""

My motivation ceased to exist entirely. I stayed in the same dead end, low paying, shitty job for over 5 years. I had absoluely no desire to advance my career, even though I'm very intelligent, skilled, and was constantly being pushed to go for promotions. Nope. I just didn't care.

I had constant anxiety. For the most part I felt ""ok"", but that was simply because I wasn't doing a goddamn thing. I just did the same reclusive thing every single day, EVERY SINGLE DAY, FOR YEARS. Not an exageration.

BAD anxiety. When I wasn't feeling my baseline anxiety, a sense of dread that I had come to accept as ""norma"", if I did have an anxious thought or experiance my anxiety 100x'd and it was unbearable. Like going into a full blown panic attack. I'd be stuck for the rest of the day(s) feeling like I was on the verge of a panic attack.

The above descriptions of anxiety led me to a level of extreme procrastination, and I mean extreme. Like putting off filing my taxes for 2 YEARS, not renewing my drivers license for a YEAR. Waiting until the very last day of my apartment lease to move out and then sign a new lease somewhere else. I was late on every single bill. I was just too anxious to do any of that.

As a result my financial situation became abysmal. I was stuck in a shit low paying job, late on every bill, unpaid bills piling up, late fee's accumulating, and having now way to catch up. I just doubled down on procrastinating which made things worse. My daily routine became to browse reddit all day every day for YEARS.

I had zero desire to socialize. I lost all of my friends. I barely saw my family. I could tell my family was worried about me, and they couldn't understand why. I only got a girlfriend as a fluke because I dosed extra phenibut for a time which shot up my libido and pushed me to find a girl, well eventually my tolerance went up and I was stuck with a gf I didn't like and an even worse addiction.

My daily habits became set in stone hardcore. And by habits I mean ""sit at my computer all day"" and that's about it. I just didn't care about doing anything else.

I lost ALL of my dreams. I was once extremely ambitious, almost too ambitious, I could feel euphoria simply by daydreaming about what i could accomplish. Phenibut and kratom killed all of that.

Now, after being off.

It feels like my life is back. I want to do things, anything. I want to get an awesome job, go to cool social events, travel the world, try new things, make friends, try new hobbies. I can't describe it honestly. It feels fucking nostalgic.

This was a loong taper, and thankfully since my tolerance was so high for both phenibut and kratom the withdrawals were not actually all that bad, no where near as bad as they were back when I first started taking them years ago and experienced withdrawals, which were fucking awful. If that's what you're dealing with, then suck it up, fight through it, and you will absolutely not regret it.",96,0

There‚Äôs common symptoms, but longevity and severity varies to a degree that is impossible to predict. It‚Äôs great to read others experiences and to identify with others going through the same shit. But it‚Äôs important to know that kratom withdrawal is not an exact science.

And these are the people I like.,"One thing I noticed kratom has done to me besides rob my savings account masterfully is that it drives me up a wall with irritation. My family where I am staying (I am separated, parent to 2 little ones, staying with parents for now) has told me I am terrible and wants nothing to do with me anymore. I am included.

Last night I lay awake writhing in discomfort,unable to pin my insomnia on any particular reason. Everything seems darker before dawn, right? All the flashbacks of past withdrawal, detoxes, hanging out... I was angry it felt like it was happening again or was going to and how did I let this happen?

 I had flowed my rule and not doses after 5pm bc if I dose after 5pm it messes with my sleep. However, I had bad insomnia anyway. Probably linked to stopping lyrica+baclofen  too fast. Who knows in the middle of the night? I just know I can't feel comfortable or go to sleep and I feel like screaming into the blackness.

I got out of bed just after 8. It's a Sunday. I kept trying to tempt myself with taking Lyrica, baclofen, kratom... I have no cravings. I don't know what is causing the lousy insomnia but I feel that so e kratom tea will end part of it. Hell, I take a reduced dose of Lyrica+baclofen and go to the kitchen. 

I proceed to immediately get into a screaming fight with my mother. Sunday breakfast instantly ruined.

It's like my emotions just crawl under my skin with angry urgency and deranged irritation. I do know that kratom has been increasingly linked to my mood's stability.

Ahhh, after a cup of kratom tea and double caffeine chai tea, I begin to feel normal again.

This feeling of being baseline is fleeting as everyone I already irritated will remind me throughout the day that I am not the same person and I don't laugh anymore or make good conversation.

Well hot damn. Another brick in the wall.

Please I decided one thing last night and that was to reach out and find help for myself. I had been a member here but have only been beginning tapering.

I found my stable dose and weigh out 3 doses per day. Every 3 days I go down 1g in the doses. So that would be 3gpd reduction. Right now I am at about 45 gpd. Tomorrow should be 42 gpd. Feedback?

I‚Äôve reached day 15 of a taper off a 50+gpd habit!! It‚Äôs been tough the past few days but I made a post on here the other day and was given great advice to help me out. I appreciate you all so much <3. On day 9 I made a post about it getting real tough and I was suggested to keep the same dose until I stabilize and so that it is what I am doing. I have been doing 16 grams a day for the past 4 and it‚Äôs getting much better!

If it were not for the advice I would probably be in misery and continuing to cut my dose, making me a lot more likely to relapse. Instead Ive gotten, for the most part , stable at 16gpd and I plan to return to dropping on Monday! 

It‚Äôs honestly really hard to feel like progress is being made when I am still at the whim of my bodies cravings and still must dose 3 times a day. But I‚Äôve realized with the help of others here as well as my girlfriend that cutting my dose by 70% in two weeks is amazing progress. I am so excited at getting so much closer to breaking the spell this powder has on me.

My mood swings and RLS have been getting a little better since stabilizing at 16gpd which is very nice. After only an hour of sleep Thursday night I have now gotten 6hrs both Friday and Saturday night!! Proper sleep makes the challenges so much easier to bare and so I‚Äôm very glad about that. I am still feeling a bit depressed at times day to day however when I feel happy about something, it feels amazing. I‚Äôve gotten the giggles more in the past few days than I have in the last 6 months! Spending time with my girlfriend when I‚Äôm happy feels like when we first got together before my usage got really bad. Unfortunately one thing I‚Äôve noticed is that without the analgesic effect of heaving Kratom use, it‚Äôs so hard to last long during sex.... lol on the bright side it feels so much better as well and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll readjust to it. I also stopped porn and masturbating 2 months ago so that might have something to do with it as well.

Anyway I am starting to ramble but I just want to share my feelings and progression with others as last time you guys were so kind and it keeps me motivated. For that I am so so grateful.

My testosterone had tanked so severely that I had lost my sex drive, was gaining weight and losing muscle, and all the other symptoms of low T were a real problem for me. When my wife and I decided we wanted to have another child I didn't think anything of it. She didn't have any problems getting pregnant with our son so I figured it would be just as easy. Not the case at all. My testosterone had gotten so low that I had pretty much become infertile. We tried for months and months with no success.

The only thing that had changed was my kratom use. I made an account here and chose the most fitting screen name for my goals. I finally quit cold turkey a few months ago. It was difficult, but I started noticing positive changes in my hormones almost right away. Sex drive increase, started making gains in the gym again, losing weight, all that good stuff. I was starting to get optimistic that things were going back to normal. 

Yesterday morning my wife randomly gave me a card at breakfast. She's pregnant!! I was so scared that I had done permanent damage to my hormones I could have cried with joy. She is due this fall and we couldn't be happier. 

I see a lot of posts on here about the hormonal changes people experience on kratom, but not much about the recovery after quitting. I took VERY detailed notes and metrics about the return of my testosterone so feel free to ask me anything. Nothing makes me squeamish or uncomfortable so don't be shy.

Today is day 2 after a taper drop, and also day 2 without Xanax to mitigate the anxiety and panic attacks. And boy did they come hard. I never realized how much keeping xanax in me every day made such a difference overall in my anxiety, even if I hadn't taken any since like noon the day before. So I got into an episode of panic attack, started thinking I cut back too quick on the Xanax and now I am withdrawing from both benzos and kratom, and man I started freaking out. Face felt like it was on fire (honestly what else is new), anxiety through the absolute roof. My wife and I started talking together about using the Xanax just when I am having horrible panic attacks like I was, so I was going to take a half of one. And maybe one tommorow too, since the weekends are so terrible for me, sitting around all day getting inside my head... 

And I thought to myself ""this is the moment, you're going to look back on this moment. It's up to you what you do, but if you take it, you're admitting you need substance, and that's not what this is all about, this is your moment"" SO instead I went out to walmart, another store, and the gas station, and came home. Then went for a nice motorcycle ride with my new motorcycle, then went for a super strenuous bicycle ride when I got back, drank a ton of water and went back out on the motorcycle to the store to get stuff to make burgers tonight (while bicycling I passed a house that was making burgers on the grill, and like we've all noticed, getting rid of kratom from our lives we have noses like bloodhounds, so I started craving burgers)

The old kratom me wouldn't have left the house for all the money in the world, and you know what? I felt better when I got back, problem solved.

I'm just so proud I stood up in that moment and decided not to take the pill. We all have a rough road getting off of this stuff, and it has been especially rough for me mentally, but I made it through another day, and can honestly say I actually won't take the benzos unless I really really need it. But even that's kind of a dud argument because in my experience, I don't really really start feeling the effects of the benzos (and oh boy are they noticeable and crazy strong) until about 2 hours after I take it... today, two hours after what could arguably be my worst panic attack yet, my panic was gone.

Yeah I still feel like my face and eyelids are on fire, and I have a long way to go on this taper, and an even longer one still for the real healing to begin, but one day at a time we are tackling this, and me saying no to that pill was surprising, but a WIN",6,0
269,2021-02-20 20:49:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/lom8ei/65_days_clean_it_gets_much_better/,65 Days Clean - It gets much better,"Hi All,

Been a while since i posted here, but overall doing very well.  My other reddit account got banned not sure why but it was similar to ""awayfromhome"".   I say this because there were a few of you i chatted with almost daily on the side and just want to let you know I am still doing well. 

To recap last year was not a great year for me.  I have struggled with addiction for all of my adult life.  After 5.5 years clean I jumped right back into heavy opiates and then into kratom.  After about a 9 month run March - December I stopped mostly cold turkey from Kratom on december 17th.

Today I am 65 days clean off of all substances and feeling amazing.  Life has essentially returned back to 100% normal in a very short time.  My cravings for Kratom are almost non existent (since day 20 I've had one close call).  Its hard to say if I am back to 100%, but I am very close. Emotionally I have stabilized, ive been sleeping fine since like day 20 and my energy is normal.  

Like I said earlier this isn't my first time clean and I've spent a lot of time learning about myself.  Getting clean and staying clean this time has been far easier then times in the past and that is likely because I know what it takes to beat this demon.

Realistically the first 3-7 days are just not going to be fun.  Depending on how much you were using and for how long changes things a bit, but overall you will feel like shit and every minute will feel like an hour.  I think its extremely important if you can to take sometime off from work and let yourself heal during this time. The stress of everyday life and the initial acute withdrawal is enough to relapse.  Additionally do not sit in front of the computer / TV all day as I personally think its the worst thing you can do.  Go for walks often, exercise, listen to music.... 

I pushed myself physically (and still am) as I found this was the only real relief I got in the first couple of weeks.  Exercise distracts you from the acutes, releases the endorphins, is healthy and helps with sleep.  Exercise is the best medicine for someone in early recovery in my opinion. 

My Timeline: 
Days 1 - 7: Felt shitty but still functional.  Spent most of my days reading this forum, walking and taking hot baths 

Days 8 - 13: 
Things start to get better. 

Days 14 - 21: 
Starting to feel really good. Instead of having moments of feeling normal, I mostly felt normal and would have waves of ""oh shit im still recovering"".  Days started to flow more normally and time didn't stand still.  

Day 23-25:
I would say this is when physically things were almost 100% back to normal.  All lingering w/d effects had disappeared and kratom was mostly off of my mind. 

I wanted to come back and share my experience as I think its good for myself to reflect, but also because I read so many horror stories.  People who were 60-90 days clean and still feeling bad. Well im here to say that by day 25 I was feeling great and still am! Life has definitely returned back to normal and like anyone I have my up and down days.

A few months ago, in the throes of addiction, I would‚Äôve never imagined myself making it to where I am now. I can say with confidence that life is much, much better without the beast of addiction looming over every second of my life.

However, being in the absolute heat of the ‚ÄúPAWS‚Äù stage is no fun at all.

Video games which I used to hold near and dear to me, now provide next to no pleasure for me. Watching tv, I am in my head too much, thus mitigating any enjoyment. The gym on the other hand is a great tool, and for the most part is pleasurable, however, after a hard workout it seems to have a bit of a comedown effect making me feel worse overall.

I started using Kratom about 3 months ago but used it on weekends only. Got side effects from 1gram, nausea and extreme motion sickness so i did not use it a lot back then. 

Started this year again and i thought to myself(stupid i know now) that i would take it everyday to build tolerance so i could build up to at least 2 grams. I did take a few days off like 4 days on 3 days off for 3 weeks.

So yesterday morning i woke up feeling a bit uncomfortable and muscles felt tight but did not think anything of it.At work my nose started running and my heart was beating a bit faster but thought i was just anxious as i am an anxious person. Also, my jaw was very tight and hard to speak.

So feeling a bit nervous i decided to take 500mg to calm my nerves and it helped but 4 hours afterwards is were all hell broke loose.

I felt very nervous, anxious, shaky as f... and it hit me, Kratom got me or i got myself in a bind. Man how did i not think i would get hooked taking an kratom like that.

I can't believe one can get hooked so easy on a substance.

So now that you know my story, please help.

How do i quit before i really get seriously hooked?

I thought of cold turkey but today is a bit worse. Took 2.5grams last night.

Lingering acutes continue to wane slowly. They are manageable. Physically, it‚Äôs really only the ongoing nausea that is bothering me, which brings me to today. 

I just drove two hours to get to the mountains for snow tubing and maybe some skiing if I‚Äôm feeling ballsy. I haven‚Äôt skied in 22 years. 

The ride up to the mountains with my companion for the weekend turned into a pretty wild demonstration of kratom withdrawal for her. She is one of two people IRL who knows what I‚Äôm going through right now. I‚Äôve given her literature on it (mostly stuff from here, thanks btw), she‚Äôs done her own research, and I‚Äôve been brutally honesty about everything with her, from the common acutes and how they‚Äôre going, to how my bowel movements are coming along and how horny I‚Äôve started to become since like day 7 or 8. But much work is still to be done on that front, not gonna lie. That‚Äôs for another post. 

During the two hour journey, she was there to witness it all. 

My vertigo kicked in and then severe nausea. Anyway, had to pull into a rest stop. She goes ‚Äújust puke in the snow‚Äù and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúif I try and puke before I go inside I‚Äôll shit my pants‚Äù. Took care of business out of both ends, left the rest stop. Oh also, every time I throw up, it‚Äôs straight bile. 

Get back on the turnpike, and start talking about my animals since I‚Äôm leaving them for the weekend. Then I start crying, thinking about them and what if one died and then start obsessing about things I numbed myself to over the years. So now I‚Äôm nearly hysterically crying for a few minutes. That passes. 

Ten minutes later I‚Äôm laughing hysterically at how ridiculous life can be and about how crazy I feel right now. And then I start telling her how horny I had just become. 

Total madness. It‚Äôs great though. Feeling it all again almost two weeks later... So grateful I jumped.",3,0

I quit 12 days ago and since it's Friday I decided to celebrate with some beer. I'm four beers deep listening to music and chilling and I'm actually able to enjoy alcohol without going overboard. 

However, I promised myself I wouldn't get complacent and that I only needed a week taking it easy. After all, it hasn't even been two weeks since I quit kratom. Looking forward to signing up and paying those exorbitant fees to hit the gym next week.

But I'm pleased to say I have a stash of zone-out xanax in my house, and didn't touch them today. That's not the right way for me to heal out of this.

I worked this morning and felt fantastic. Got home and tried to take a nap and fell right into my depression, impending doom, existential thoughts. Didn't end up falling asleep :( Taking a nap, even if brief, seems to make the world of difference in my day, because I'm not dogshit tired at the end of the day and keep having to think ""how many more hours do I have to stay awake?"" So I think all in all that's why I am feeling so garbage tonight, my brain didn't get it's reset, and I've been up since 2am. 

But I notice when I'm not feeling crappy, I am feeling really great. I'm hoping it's not my body getting used to the lower kratom doses, but I know that can't be true because of how much I am withdrawing. Well I'm not really withdrawing so much as these panic attacks and anxiety are destroying me. But I still haven't gone back up in dose, and don't plan to (my wife probably won't let me anyways) and goddamnit no one ever dies from a panic attack, what the hell am I so worried about?? UGH

I know I need the accountability but I am terrified. I have never lied to my husband. I have never hid anything from him. He is a good man but I am so scared of what his reaction might be. Or maybe I‚Äôm just scared because I know once I tell him I have a long road ahead. I started seeing a psychiatrist about 2 months ago when I was starting my 2nd taper. He gave me gabapentin and clonidine. I hated the clonidine. It made me super dizzy. I took the gabapentin but I was not CT. The psychiatrist said it was ok to take it during my taper but I feel like all it did was enhance the K and and now barely takes my anxiety away.

Even if i can get past the worst of the withdrawals it never lasts. When im feeling low and depressed its such an easy quick fix. I would just take it all the time except for the fact that once my tolerance gets high enough im dosing stupid amounts just to feel ok and then my existing anxiety and depression spins out of control and Im basically acting like a junkie. I cant control my moods, my ADHD is worse, and worst of all I've thought myself to be a sober person. I dont drink or do drugs and i convinced myself for a long time this was just an herbal remedy or medication that helped me with life. But now i know its not. It doenst help me do anything except avoid issues and escape reality by being high. at my worst i was taking like 20 pill doses just to feel it and i would be getting withdrawals within hours. Ive lost friendships and my girlfriend from having this weird erratic personality and constantly trying to justify this as a managable way to live. A few weeks ago i drove out to the desert and stayed in a motel with water and snacks and turned my phone off so i could kick without any external stressors like work or personal responsibilites. It was awful. I came back home a depressed mess. And when it came time to go back to work I just couldnt do it without taking a dose. Ive been on it for so long that i forgot how to be a normal happy person without it. 

I started microdosing mushrooms as someone recommended and it actually has helped me dose less times a day, helped me with some adhd and depression. Im happy with this unique result i didnt expect. But I still feel like I need more of a spiritual change in the way im thinking to really make the quit stick. Being open and honest with my sponsor about it, and talking to my therapist about it too. I have lots of encouragement and im grateful for the resources and help I am able to get at this time.

Im new to reddit and was floored by all the support that exists and have been reading all your recovery stories and they give me a lot of hope. I know I'm doing the right things right now,  but i wanted to reach out and say hello to the community. Even though im in recovery programs and the struggle of addiction is the same whether its alcohol, heroin, or whip hits, kratom is such an unsually specific thing that not a lot of people know about or understand. Which i guess for me is one of the reasons i felt it was easy to hide. ""what are you taking? oh its like an herbal thing? is it like kava? cool."" Not to mention, unlike heroin, there is a very pro-kratom community. Either people who are in denial about how its affecting their life, or theyre non addicts who are able to moderate their use and actually benefit from its use.

I plan on slowly reducing over the next few weeks and giving myself a good free week to come off. Let me know if anyone has any tips for the postwithdrawal depression phase. How long did it take before you felt like a normal human being again? How long before your obsession to use went away, and how did you do it?

Hi everyone. I‚Äôm 6-ish weeks into a taper that‚Äôs going very well. I‚Äôm down to 4 gpd and I feel fairly good, all things considered.

I‚Äôm starting to look ahead to jumping off to 0 gpd. My kratom habit is very very long. I‚Äôve been a daily user before kratom was cool, for about 11 or 12 years. And I‚Äôve spent that time between 9-20gpd but the last year has been solidly 20gpd so I know even a great taper isn‚Äôt enough to save me from a crappy time. Like many people on here, I can‚Äôt be out of order in any real way at my job. I also won‚Äôt be able to take more than a day off at a time until mid-summer. I had the thought, could my taper involve going kratom-free on the weekends, and then going back to my minimum dose to function on weeknights? Would this really get me closer to quitting, or would I just be putting myself through a series of bad weekends for no appreciable benefit?

Kratom turned on me eventually (probably around year... 2?) and caused near constant anxiety, panic attacks semi-regularly, and a very dark mental space for me that I have no desire to be in again. 

Kratom is a very lonely drug.

Since I was using for so long, I tapered down from my 20g (4g x 4-5 doses daily), until I was taking 1.2g x 1 dose daily.

I have quit Kratom CT 2-3 times before this, but only ever lasted a month or so before beginning to use again.

Perhaps it‚Äôs just me getting tired of this absurd routine of being pushed to the brink of what I feel is insanity (from using), then quitting, feeling better, then relapsing... or maybe I‚Äôm just maturing every time I quit and fail... I don‚Äôt know.

But I truly think that tapering is the key to my success so far, and the drastic reduction I feel in cravings compared to previous times I have quit CT.

Thought this might be helpful to anyone trying to decide on how they should go about quitting.

There is no need for anyone to feel trapped by this drug. You can do this and are strong enough to taper, or cold turkey it, and quit for good.

Need some inspiration from y'all.,"I have had this account for 3 or 4 years but have avoided it completely for the last 2 years or so. I was on such a good taper and this group really helped me with that. But life happened, I got busy, couldn't get ahold of my old strain, and slowly found myself taking a little more every few weeks until I was at the point I started my taper from. I knew I should have kept up with this group and talk to others for motivation but the addict in me avoided it completely until tonight/this morning. I've been taking kratom for around 4 or 5 years now and it has been proven to be a problem for me from about a month after I started up until now. There are alot of reasons for me to quit again and I am committed. I know I can taper because I did before and was really working it until i screwed up a few months in. I had a seizure recently, at the age of 30, which I dont blame on kratom entirely. I blame ot on poor mental health, sleeping pills, lack of sleep and taking an extra dose before breakfast the morning it happened. The worst part is it happened at a breakfast spot me and my mom go to about once a week and she was scared to death, understandably so. My girlfriend was scared, family, friends, everyone close to me. To make it even worse, it happened a few days before Christmas and I barely got out of the hospital the day before Christmas eve. Again, I dont blame kratom for the seizure, I attribute it to poor mental health, but alot of the mental health problems came from the constant need for kratom. I really appreciate this group more than I can explain and I'm ready to go at it again. Its 5AM in Texas so I will be getting some sleep after this is posted, but it would really mean alot to me if anyone reading this could engage me so I have the reminder in the morning and the motivation to keep  going with a taper. Sorry for the biblical length post, but there was just alot to get out after years of avoiding this all. Thanks in advance to anyone who has the time to reach out. Love from Texas",7,0

I remember early on in the first week or so, two months seemed like a decade away. On day ten I returned to construction work. My productivity was definitely low and constantly being in a state of fatguie and anxiety up until around day 20. Seemed everyday after that was major improvement. 

I'd say I'm basically back to baseline although I constantly still have diahrea and lastnight I randomly had RLS which hasn't occured in weeks. Luckily I have absolutely no cravings. So much so, that my wife takes 2 capsules before bed and she consistently asks me to go fetch her bottle from her purse and I have never caved. I have had a couple dreams about cravings and even one dream where I put some in my mouth for like 30 seconds and then spit it out. 

I tried some high amounts of vitamin c, d, iron and zinc and honestly I don't think they helped in the least bit. I tried gaba too but it seemed to  make me even more fatigued if that makes sense. 

Best advice I got is

1) write down the reason you want to quit and hang it up somewhere you can see every morning. 
2) take off from work for a week
3) clean your place up before you make the jump. I wish I'd done that, but I quit around Christmas so it was gonna get wrecked anyway, but I noticed clutterness was driving me insane. 
4) Have a good support system but honestly I just wanted to be alone so no one would see me in that state. 
5) Find something you like to take your mind off the pain your going through, me personally I binge watched West World (amazing) 
6) Music definitely helped with depression
7) after the first week, make a daily to do list. It could be one simple thing you want to get done. That really helped make me feel accomplished and uplifted. 

All that being said the only thing that's gonna get you through this hardship, is time. It's gonna suck. It's the ultimate test of self discipline and determination. Remember, today is the tomorrow your were so afraid of yesterday.",41,0

I get to a point in the day where I just lose it mentally. Luckily when I am at work, I am distracted and don't really get to that point, but I get home and try to take a nap and my brain just starts back down the dark road again... I been doing the Wim Hoff, meditation (I think I must be doing it wrong), and hard uphill bike riding. I have always eaten healthy for the last 6 or 7 years, fresh cooked meals every night. I take magnesium every night to go to sleep, and now have been taking Ester-C non-acidic 1000mg vitamin C with citrus bioflavonoids (non of the local shops around here sell liposomal vitamin C). I dunno where I'm at, I am sick of these episodes, my face starts feeling like the skin is on fire, and I feel extremely out of it, like almost third person view of reality, facing existential thoughts again and again... Other parts of the day I'm totally fine, but these happen every single day now. I am sleeping (mostly) through the night, and do get naps in almost every day (fuckn not today :(  ) Is this just part of tapering? The brain trying to correct itself? Am I going to have to deal with this forever??

One thing I can say, I was taking Xanax to help with the panic attacks, and then started just taking them every day. At first it was 2 .5mg pills each day, with the second one before bed because it was the only way I could fall asleep. Then I cut back to one .5mg pill per day, and felt great more often throughout the day, cutting it in half and taking one half around noon, and the other around 3 or 4 or 5. But I felt like shit in the hours leading up to the noon half. Like my body was going through mental withdrawals waiting for that dose... Well now it is time for this stuff to end, I only took a half a pill yesterday and a quarter of one today (and felt like garbage the whole time I was on it). And I don't plan on taking any tomorrow... hopefully I don't go through residual withdrawals on top of my kratom withdrawals, but I can't help but think that I started feeling worse in general when I start feeling bad when I started taking the xanax, so that shit's got to go. I will still keep some in the cabinet like that guy said for extreme last ditch situations, but I am for sure done with that stuff.

Anyways, tomorrow is my next taper drop. So I started around 70gpd several months ago, unmeasured like many of us of course, and started having panic attacks so I cut back and went back up, and cut back all unrecorded. Today is 60 days since we started recording the doses, and managing the taper, never going over 30. I am cutting 1.4gpd off every 5 days. .2 grams off of each dose. Tomorrow will mark us at a total of 16.8gpd. I know that's super slow, but I'm terrified of the mental aspect of this getting worse, and I kind of feel like I need the slow taper amount of time to get used to the idea of being sober. I think I said it before, I'm not really addicted to kratom, I'm addicted to the idea of making it though the hours until my next scheduled dose of whatever it is and then take it and ""feel better"". I'm more addicted to being addicted to something than I am to kratom itself, which I feel is worse... But the last time we dropped, days 1 and 2 were mostly great, so here's hoping! Also, I think if I can make it out of the woods from the xanax, I will start making my drops in kratom more significant, get off this awful shit sooner!",3,0

I have zero desire to use kratom again. In fact, I'm sitting at a kava bar drinking kombucha and watching others feed the kratom beast. My physical fitness has improved considerably. I just couldn't figure out why I wasn't making any progress over months. Maybe it's because I was sauced up on fucking kratom.

I've gained about 15lbs of muscle and I work out 5 or 6 days a week now. I get at least 7 hours of sleep each night. Work is much, much more bearable. I'm going through a divorce also, and if I was still using kratom id be in a very bad mental place. Thank God for quitting.

Anyway just another post telling you guys i'm doing it/have done it for almost 4 months and it truly is a long ass flu. You got this, you're not supposed to feel great all the time, but i promise you will to an immeasurable degree once you commit to get off the sludge.

PEACE & LOVE YOURSELF

I was 12-15gpd with some peaks and valleys above and below that for just over 4 years. Quit alcohol entirely to get through kratom WD. Unfortunately I am drinking again, but not in the same way as I don't have the soul wrenching feeling of kratom withdrawal or the dumb confidence of kratom high to keep me drinking like I was. That will be the next habit to at least curb. 

Hardest thing for me was coming to terms with kratom being the only thing keeping me in my line of work. I had growing chronic pain and anxiety at work and could not work without kratom. I still cannot execute my work even in practice sober. The thought of doing a days work makes me cringe. It was likely a good time to move on to something new, but the pandemic is making that feel like a pipedream. I know the time will come. Working on my patience. Doing enough to get by in other ways in the meantime.

Life isn't objectively better without kratom in it, but being free from it and feeling level throughout the day is worth it 1000x over. Over the course of 4 years I increasingly used kratom as a crutch to become a person I cannot be without it. I wouldn't say I have my life back, as I need to create a new life first, but I would say I have my mind back. To me that's worth more than everything I thought I needed kratom to maintain. 

Good luck to everyone on this journey. I feel so much less lost because of all of your stories. I managed to hide this addiction and lie to everyone in my life about my use for 4 years, and subsequently managed to quit without telling anyone or asking for support. I can't imagine doing that without this sub.",24,1

Used to help with energy and motivation and then the gym. After a while it just became a habit. Prolly averaged 40-50 GPD. Some extract.  

Quit for like 8 months in between.  Hard quit.  Nothing is worse than waking up at 3am hot as balls and your whole body is on fire/twitching.  

Cut my intake in half a few days ago. Not too bad. Kind of a like a half cold turkey. Get body used to use for a week.  Half it again. Then jump off. 

What I use- 
Magnesium
Potassium
B- complex
Lots of juicing with fruits n veges. 
Kava
Weed
Ashwadghanda 
Hylands restless legs ( first time trying) 
Exercise
Walks
Hot showers
Cold showers

I‚Äôm two day without taking anything and the restless legs and insomnia are a bitch.  I started taking kratom to quit drinking and it worked but now I rather be substance free.  I have gabapentin 100 mg caps got 20 left of those.  Been taking 300 mgs the first night and slept great when I feel asleep but last night was a night mare with restless legs and insomnia.  My wife said prob just get more kratom and taper but I feel like I‚Äôm already two nights free of it so should just man up and stay course.  How long do you think it will last or is getting kratom a better idea then quitting cold turkey.  Thank you in advance. Anything is much appreciated.,1,0

I was at 2gpd + extract every 4 hour including night.  The reason I came here is my sleep was so messed up that I've been sleeping in the guest room so that I can dose and hide it from my wife. I finally had a moment looking into the mirror and at my marriage and was like WTH you doing man?  

I immediately dropped the extract and went to 1.5-1.8ish (was not weighing yet).  Had extremely bad RLS for about a day but it went away pretty quickly and I immediately felt better and less cloudy headed.  I kept dosing every 4 hours at 1.5-1.8gpd including at night. Not getting enough sleep was making me absolutely miserable and the lack of sleep made it harder to not take a higher dose to just feel better.  The next change I made was a finally started weighing my doses like everyone says.  That helped me so that I knew I was on a slow decline.

Now here is the part I was scared of but that was way easier than I expected.  I started spacing out my doses to every 5 hours and I was able to cut a dose.  Then a few days later I cut another and next day another and now today I had 1 dose at 6 am, my next is at 2pm and my last is at 10pm.  I haven't dropped my dose amount but the amount per day has of course dropped tremendously.  

I already feel so much better and I've had so much more interest in my wife, kids and friends.  I've been replying via text and calling people back that I was ignoring.   Last night I had a full 6 hour stretch of sleep which I haven't had in ages.  Right this second I'm going through some WD and my chest feels uncomfortable, back hurts but that's about it.  It's nothing I can't handle and other than being a little extra fidgety I don't have any major RLS atm.  The RLS was the part about the first withdrawals that I felt I couldn't take.  I felt like I was trapped in my skin and needed to jump in a ball pit and wiggle my entire body non stop to feel better. 

During this taper I've been able to maintain my work and family life even better than before the taper.  Meetings at work have been more productive and my drive for everything in life has skyrocketed.  

I can't wait to be completely done but I feel like I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I know that getting rid of those last doses will still be hard but now that the head fog is gone I can finally start feeling and seeing all the benefits of quitting.

Six years ago I quit hydromorphine addiction cold turkey and to be honest the Kratom withdrawals are worse. With morphine you don't get these motherfucking hardcore anxiety depression.

  


The last months I fucked up big. Kratom wasn't working anymore. When I started two years ago I loved it so much. It made me nod for hours, chasing the dragon, flying through sweet waking dreams. It was pure bliss. But a few months ago it stopped working. I started to take Kratom only to not get withdrawals. I had a 40 GPD habit. Man don't ask how and why but I started fucking with heroin. I always used for three days and then stopped, with Kratom I was able to not get into heroin addiction. After a while I knew I had to stop.

  


So I got myself some Gabapentin, started using that and cut down the Kratom. Now I'm on a 18 GPD habit. 3 x 6g.

But the lyrica didn't help I still got RLS. So I'm asking you guys - there is no easy way out right? I have to quit cold turkey. I can't taper down, it doesn't fucking work for me.

  


Do you guys have some words to say about my post? Thoughts? I know I'm an idiot, you don't have to tell me, I mean I'm not your boss, of course you can call me an idiot but please be creative. Do you guys have some experience to share with me?

I can not taper. Well, I guess that‚Äôs not 100% true. The times I have tapered I‚Äôve always ended up going back to using large dosages again. I have been taking kratom daily essentially since Sept. Started at 15gpd and extract shots on the weekends to get a nice buzz. I‚Äôm up to 30-50gpd now and more often than not a few shots a day. When I take the shots, I don‚Äôt take the powder, so I‚Äôd estimate it‚Äôs roughly the same range of GPD. The kratom pickle for me is that I just keep taking more and more, but I can‚Äôt get even get the buzz I want. I just get anxious and feel like shit. It‚Äôs like if I take a dose I feel good for 15 min when it comes on, then the rest of the 2-3 hours I have an ominous sense of dread. Then the withdrawals start and I end up taking another dose. Last night I reached my breaking point and threw out my stash of powder. I‚Äôm heading to a cabin in the mountains of Maine for the next few days and there‚Äôs no opportunity to buy any more shots/powder. I‚Äôm trying this mega dosing vitamin c thing. Seems to be honestly blunting most of the physical withdrawals, but it‚Äôs certainly amplified the diarrhea. Anyway. Fuck kratom. I quit alcohol 2 years ago and that fucked up my life way worse. It‚Äôs time to kick this stupid shit before it gets any worse. I know it will suck, but being on kratom sucks too.

My usual dose is 2-3 shots o f  the liquid extract in a 24 hr period. I get them from a head shop thats within walking distance from where i stay. I've tried to go cold turkey an I experience some heavy accute withdrawal symptoms such as anxiet/depression and restlessness, not to mention my eyes and nose constantly 'drooling'. I also get this rage thats triggered by ridiculous things like certain peoples' voices or certain types of music...stuff that would normally just be annoying makes me feel like i need to destroy a whole room with my bare hands before i feel calm. it sucks bc im typically a pretty easy going/non confrontational person with a good sense of humor. At this point i dont even know *i*f thats who i am or if it's just my 'disguise' that i've created through my addiction. Im recovering from a 12 yr entanglement with oxycontin and norco, basically any pain pill i could get my hands on. when i dont use i feel disconnected from everything and a general lack of ambition to do anything...even the things i used to enjoy like being creative or skateboarding etc. I was in a methadone program for 4 yrs and actually weened off the stuff and completed my program november of 2020...even though i feel like i just replaced it with the kratom. I actually tried to get back on the methadone due to the withdrawals i was experiencing with kratom but in a weird twist of fate i was told that the clinic will not admit me due to the fact that kratom is not an actual opiod...so technically i havent relapsed wich is good except i feel just as shitty as i did when i was coming off pills or methadone...im sure you can empathize. Im just looking for some people i can talk to since i've been pretty isolated by my mental state in addition to the pandemic shutting down any meetings/groups i could physically attend. Any advice or encouragement would be greatly appreciated. Im in a pretty dark place since the kratom has been such a huge help with keeping me 'engaged' as far as work and every day functioning. Unfortunately i cant afford to spend the $300 a week that im spending on it...i dont know what to do  and i cant afford to take time off work to white knuckle my way through the accute withdrawals...i feel like this is already taking up too much space.

It‚Äòs an anxiolytic which contains certain alkaloids. I don‚Äòt know what research is saying but a placebo would be enough for me.  I‚Äòm from 7g phenibut down to 4g and I recognized that my withdrawal symptoms are away and mood and self esteem is completely back a minute after taking my phenibut dose so this is placebo too. I mean phenibut wouldn‚Äôt‚Äòt be able to show effects that fast. So my body and mind is able to cope and be okay by placebo. 

I know that I need some substance intake to cope with the withdrawals because otherwise something is missing in my life. I suffer from depression and social anxiety since I was 15 (now 21) and I was able to live a almost normal life only with help by substances (first alcohol, now don‚Äòt drink any anymore, then phenibut, then kratom).

Maybe some one has some experience here using mulungu to come off Phenibut and/or kratom. I cold turkeyed kratom yesterday. Maybe someone has some ideas or knowledge about scientific reasons that mulungu could help.

Otherwise there also is a substance called Kanna (sceletium tortuosum) which is an SSRI. What about this? Is this something that might help? For that I would have to get off my amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressants I take (100mg at night) which also acts on Serotonin. But I think being on amitriptyline even if I don‚Äòt feel any effects from it might also ease my coming off symptoms.

And regarding my depression and social anxiety I already tried about 8 prescribed pharmaceuticals (the usual ones, SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOIs, tricyclics) and 2 depth psychological therapies and am now in a behavioral therapy. So I tried the usual ways but none give me an effect at all. Phenibut was the only thing that enabled me to live a life. The reason why I started.",2,0

Today is a bad day for me :( Steady slide as the day drove on into these intrusive existential thoughts again, I thought I was past that! Well anyways, today is day 4 after a taper drop and as I've experienced before, day 4 is usually the worst... 

The plan was to cut back the Xanax another 1/4 of a pill for the day for today, but I didn't. I had some unhealthy thoughts about taking more than I was planning because of a rough morning at work, or I have to be able to make it through my meeting for work after opening, but in the end I really only took the whole half pill because I was worried about today being day 4 and day 4 being the worst usually. And a fear that I may be cutting back too quickly on the xanax, and it will just add to my kratom withdrawals. Fear pops up and then inevitably that fear becomes reality with my dumb brain, I start freaking out, take the whole half pill, rest is history. But I'm forgetting how dumb I can be sometimes. The xanax is NOT helping my withdrawals from kratom, no matter how much I try to convince myself that it does. So tomorrow, beyond definitely I will be taking only a quarter pill, and see how it goes from there. I am grateful that I only took it because I wanted to make sure I wasn't cutting back too quick, and not just to ""feel good"" which the damn stuff just does not do. 

Having existential thoughts is no bueno for someone as weak-minded as me, and taking something that makes me feel out of it? Ugh, what a stupid move. So I took the half and took a nap, my asshole cat threw up and woke me up, surprisingly I fell back asleep. Then I woke up, face skin feeling like it's on fire, and felt worse than I did earlier in the day... you ever take a nap just a little too long in the middle of the day and feel like absolute garbage when you wake up? Yeah so that, plus withdrawals lol.

So yeah, bad day today, but maybe tomorrow will be better. I know Saturday will, I am getting my dream motorcycle given to me for a year. Hopefully I will have successfully weaned off of the Xanax by then, I am not in any shape to operate a motorcycle on any kind of sliver of that stuff.

I‚Äôm sure all of us can agree that we could easily deal with physical WD if we were mentally feeling normal and generally happy, getting off of kratom would be a breeze. 

But, unfortunately that‚Äôs never the case. 

With me, I tried quitting multiple times, every time I was unsuccessful it was mainly because of how I didn‚Äôt remind myself how many days/weeks/months I hadn‚Äôt taken it, I‚Äôd forget and solely focus on the fact that ‚Äúif I just had kratom‚Äù or just constantly thinking about kratom in the wrong way on my bad days, I‚Äôd break and have to start over. 

When the time came and  I finally rid myself of it and a few weeks had past, I found myself slowly stepping closer to that ledge, it was almost unnoticeable until I was there, I‚Äôd think about kratom here or there, but without realizing it I was slowly letting it back into my mind and eventually letting it take control on a day I felt weak or down. 

So here‚Äôs what I started attempting to do, after I suffered through the initial stages of withdrawal which, weren‚Äôt too awful because I tapered at a moderate pace while also building better habits, I told myself to that everytime the slightest little even almost innocent thought about kratom came up I‚Äôd remind/meditate on all the days I had wished that stuff out of my life, I imagined all the times I thought about my life without kratom and how badly I wanted to change.. and then I would change my perception, because for me, quitting kratom for good was, so far, the most difficult thing I‚Äôve ever done in my life. So with that being said, I constantly reminded myself of what I had done, what I had achieved, that sulking on something that I wanted so bad out of my life made absolutely no sense whatsoever, I convinced myself at every second I could that having done this I could literally do anything I wanted with my life, I had broken free and although it was hard it was something I could always be happy and grateful about. 

Now it easier said than done, and it doesn‚Äôt just completely fix the situation and what you‚Äôre feeling in the moment right away, but you need to do it, you need to constantly remind yourself of what you accomplished at any moment you can, you need to give meaning to what you did, you need to realize as much as you can that you have indeed changed your life. 

And lastly if you‚Äôve made it this far, I‚Äôve got one of my favorite quotes from a YouTube video I heard along time ago that I started watching everyday on my journey of quitting and self improvement. 

FYI I do not know who this quote is from. I know the video but I have the quote written down.

‚ÄúWhat it is, is the construct that we‚Äôve created our personalities is so strong, that you have to do something extreme to be able to transcend that, to be able to break through those things. Cause we‚Äôre so ingrained with our personalities, and we believe that that‚Äôs who we really are, it‚Äôs just, when you do something of an extreme nature, you get to see what sits below that surface, you get to see that you actually have a choice, that there‚Äôs something more than who you pretend to be.. and whilst we are really attached to who we are as individuals, there‚Äôs also so much more to life, if you have that Freedom. Of. Choice.‚Äù

Just normal baseline seasonal dysthymia (I hate winter whether or not I‚Äôm on something). The only lingering withdrawal symptom I have now is semi-frequent sneezing, which is not at all distressing for me. This week I have also quit vaping and I am weaning myself off of my leftover nicotine lozenges.

For reference, I CT‚Äôd off of 35-45ish gpd, which I‚Äôd taken for close to 3 years. Days 2-4 post-quit sucked the worst, and things steadily improved since then. I am also someone who has NOT experienced opioid addiction/withdrawal, so this was a rather new form of shittiness for me. I HAVE experienced severe alcohol withdrawal, however, and will say that kratom withdrawal was significantly less horrifying albeit much more drawn out.

I went to the Dr. And they are keeping an eye on it but I have no answers. Dr appointment tomorrow though. 


Along side of that they found that my red blood cells were slightly enlarged. Keeping an eye on it, blood work tomorrow probably. I will update for the curious. 

I might have some mental health issues as well due to it. Maybe a form of bi polar? I was feeling good the first 2 or 3 months, but looking back now and after struggling with a big down turn, im wondering if it was a form of mania and the downturn was the natural cycle of something quite possibly. I dont know. 

I do know I started taking 150 mg wellbutrin xr and it helped immensely with my fatigue, except now I feel weird and different in other ways, I have energy but I think my.anxiety Is making my social interactions almost unbearable now.

My husband and I are both addicted to Kratom. I‚Äôve been on it for about 9 months and he‚Äôs been on about a year and a half. He originally started bc of an alcohol addiction and I started because he shared it with me and I loved the feeling. Using it every few days turned into every day fast. It makes me feel so good, but I know it‚Äôs bad for me. I‚Äôve never been addicted to anything before and I don‚Äôt have an addictive personality. I realized how bad it was when we both decided to try and quit cold turkey a few weeks ago. We only lasted 3 days and our symptoms were terrible. He uses heavier than I do. I was probably using anywhere from 4-5 grams a day depending on the day. Sometimes on weekends I‚Äôd use up to 8 ish grams. Which I know isn‚Äôt a lot compared to some people but it‚Äôs been steady for 9 months. We started taking it again with tapering in mind and now we are officially tapering. I‚Äôm down to about 1.35 grams twice a day and I‚Äôm feeling ok but definitely not the greatest. He‚Äôs starting at 2.75 grams once a day then 1.35 grams twice a day. I‚Äôm planning to taper completely off in 2-3 weeks. I know this is the right decision as i think it‚Äôs been affecting my hormones since we are trying to get pregnant and I‚Äôm having problems.

Just had some minor chills on Day 12. Think thats over. Cravings are still there and mainly come after work when I'm sore and tired, knowing some powder will fix me  all better for the moment (**LIES** ignore the inner addict).

Notable changes i noticed...

I feel **stronger** physically since quitting. Not sure what it is, but I can lift, push and pull everything with much more force. My physical energy is actually higher than when on Kratom, but I have to push myself mentally to get there, instead of relying on a herbal chemical to do it for me, for free with no conscious effort.

More talkative than before. Kratom made me quiet and a ""stone"" especially when the 45 minute buzz wore off. The buzz made me happier, more social and motivated but when that **SHORTLY** passed.... I'd become angry, apathetic and emotionally disinterested upon cessation.

Increased emotional intelligence, since kratom IS an opioid that dulls your senses. While I feel more pain and  the lows can be challenging, I also feel more mentally stable. Less mood swings, less downs and upset. The days of a K buzz wearing off and making me angry, irritable and demotivated are gone. Prime example: Take kratom, want to play video games only while high, when it wore off I'd just quit because I found no pleasure or motivation to continue (Anhedonia?) in the activity anymore. So I'd just stare at my phone browsing in a moody silent apathy to the point I'd hate myself for feeling this terrible over literally nothing. ***The Kratom in the end was making me miserable (3 years daily user, 15-30 GPD)***

LOTS of hair growing. **Kratom DEFINTELY cases hair loss** even at 15 GPD. Hair is much more dense all over the body. Head hair grew out. FAST after week 1 off.

Visually colors seem to be brighter and more pronounced.

Music definitely sounds less like ""noise"" and more enjoyable as is should. Still not 100%.

Sleep is back to normal. Appetite is also increased, eating way more food gained weight and look healthier.

Strange purple blotches on skin are gone. Skin looks more vibrant and healthy.

Sex drive increased a little. I thought it would come back but hasn't depsite taking horny goat weed, zinc and testosterone supplements. Might just take more time or eating the right foods (Nuts, salmon, oysters, fish...etc)",8,0

Severe constipation(and the very real home plumbing issues that resulted from it)

Fearing withdrawal

Anxiety waiting for packages to arrive

This helps a lot because I struggle with self control when it gets tougher. She also has my stash to prevent any slip ups. 

honestly the first 3-4 days were much easier than the last few. I don‚Äôt even know exactly how much I was taking on average before I started it varied a lot from day to day but I‚Äôd imagine that 35-50g per day would be pretty close with 5+ doses a day. 

For the taper, I take 3 doses each day, morning, afternoon and night. I started with 8-8-8 and it goes down a half gram each day so that day 2 is 8-8-7.5, then 8-7.5-7.5,  then 7.5-7.5-7.5,  7,5-7.5-7 and so on. I had no real serious withdrawal from it until the last couple days.

During the day I don‚Äôt have to many cravings (which are likely mostly mental) but night has been getting rough. I also work at night used to generally use the most in the evening with HUGE doses at night to help me sleep and not wake up in withdrawal in the morning. I decided on day 5 to try to speed up the process by cutting 2 grams off the afternoon dose each day with the plan to only take 2 doses closer to the end of the taper, or when I felt confident doing so. (For example day one would have been 8-6-8 this way)

I‚Äôm not sure if it has something to do with this dose reduction or it‚Äôs just finally catching up to me but I was hoping for advice on a way to keep a similar taper going but have less during the day and more in the evening. Last night I couldn‚Äôt sleep til 6am and I spent hours tossing and turning it was awful. RLS was beginning to kick in a bit maybe 6 hrs after the evening dose. I know I will need to learn to sleep without it again at some point but I was hoping to deal with that later when I can use a week of vacation from work to jump cold turkey. Given that I work during the evening it‚Äôs also very hard to deal with the symptoms that are starting to show up.

The biggest issues for me so far has been the mood swings, restlessness, and cravings. I hate the mood swings, some days I go back and forth between straight up manic and extremely motivated to depressed and ready to give up half a dozen times! ( on the bright side it‚Äôs nice to be able to feel such strong emotions again)

1) Do you guys think this a solid taper plan?

2) Would it be a bad idea to concentrate more of the daily dosage in the evening?

3) should I maybe just bring back the higher sized afternoon dose since it seemed to get bad at night once I cut that dose?

4) For those who have/had mood swings how do/did you deal with them personally?

I joined this Subreddit about a year ago and I was unfortunately still struggling with opiates and Kratom

I am now finally off all medication and for the past three days I have successfully jumped from 36GPD to 24GPD without too much heart ache. 

I have written myself a taper which I would assume is quite fast as it means dropping 0.5GPD which takes me to early April however I imagine the way this stuff works I will probably jump somewhere near 5GPD.

I haven‚Äôt been this close to freedom in years and I‚Äôm now 29 days nicotine free which really helped me moderate K too. 

I hope I can manage this taper and if anyone has any input please say. I‚Äôm usually a cold turkey kinda guy but I‚Äôve never lasted so this is my new attempt",5,0

I've tried tapering twice and I just have absolutely 0 control over myself and end up taking more than I should because I know it'll make me feel better. I feel like this demon has so much control over me and I'm terrified that I won't be able to quit. After a long day (or in the middle of it) I find myself reaching for my kratom because it helps me loosen up and feel better.

I've wanted to quit for about 4 months now and I feel so helpless to my addiction. There is a vape shop 20 feet from my apartment so even when I do have 24 hours with no kratom under my belt, I go running to buy more. The pain I feel in my whole body is so unbearable that Advil or Tylenol doesn't help. I feel so lost to my addiction and like I'm not strong enough to quit.

Such intense back pain, omg. BUT, did I take a larger dose of kratom? Fuck NO. I am deadset on sticking to this taper, and I'll be damned if my addict brain tries to negotiate it's way back in because of more pain. 

That being said I really do think I did overdo it this evening with the bike ride, I am extremely worn out. But hey, we all know this is going to be uncomfortable trying to get off of this stuff... I did get a brief nap in, once again that helped absolutely tremendously. The thing that sucks is that I have been drinking so so much more water than I used to to help me heal through the withdrawals, that I snapped awake because I had to pee so bad... but I got SOME sleep, and had a steady stream of urine? I'll take it!

I can honestly say that the majority of today I felt fine and normal. I know that might not be the case tomorrow and the next day, I tend to feel the third and fourth day after a taper drop are the worst, but to have one day where I mostly felt fine? That's been unheard of these last few months. Impending doom, and existential thoughts very infrequent today, less than they have in a long time. I think also the suicidal thoughts are a thing of the past. I don't want to get my hopes up that the worst is past me, but honestly 2.6 grams is such a low dose compared to what I used to take. I'm feeling like zero part of me is taking it at all to try to get any kind of feeling out of it, just to keep to the schedule and taper slow. But we have a quit date! Doing the math, if we keep up exactly at this taper schedule pace, I will be down to zero grams of kratom come April 20th. And if all days could be like today? Incredibly doable :)",7,0

Tried again Sunday, about had a mental breakdown, and ended up taking about 2 grams to get ""the demon"" out of my head. Today (monday) I've had no kratom at all. This is coming from a 2 year habit, with the last 6 months being at 80-90 gpd.

The absolute WORST part of trying to go CT the first two days, was the disconnect from my wife. She could see me struggling mentally, but I had to hide from her and couldn't stomach to tell her why, out of fear of breaking her heart and losing my family. 

Listen, I had an eye opener about 4 days ago, when my wife took a sip of my cbd drink by accident. That could have been my kratom tea. And she is breast feeding my son. What if my kratom had gotten into her milk supply and sent my son to the hospital? What if it was my 2 yo that drank it? 

I was terrified to tell my wife for fear she would leave and take the kids, but it was trumped by my refusal to unintentionally harm my kids if they ingested my potion.

This is day 1 CT. Feel like shit. Foggy head. But I keep pushing through knowing that I'll never have to worry about telling my baby girl I can't make it to her practice because daddy has to go make Kratom Tea or get more. Or make up excuses to my wife as to why I would never share my drinks.

I had been 6 years clean from a 10 year H/Oxy addiction that ran my life when I discovered Kratom. So kicking Kratom sucks, but its not the same ""I'm going to cut my fucking skin off so its stops itching so bad"" as quitting H was. I thought Kratom would be harmless. Its sold im my local gas station, after all. Boy was I wrong.

Sitting here, with the fog starting to lift, I can't for the life of me figure out why I have volunteered to be in this position again.

Just thought I'd share my story incase anyone is in a similar situation as I was a few days ago.

Good luck yall.

Figured since I have decided to quit it wouldn't hurt to chime in every now and then to hold myself accountable.

Created a throwaway because my immediate family doesn't know about my Kratom usage, and if they did find out it would be a deal breaker. This is one of the main reasons I have decided to quit.

I know I have an addictive personality (okay, I am an addict) and if it wasn't for my wife and kids I would probably just say fuck it (sad, I realize, but I guess it goes hand in hand with the self destructive mentality of an addict). So I guess I am pretty damn lucky I have them.

Anyway, I decided to quit so I can stop the sneaking around and hopefully rebuild my relationship with my family. I didn't realize that Kratom had a pretty significant impact on my relationship until it was too late. Hopefully the emotionless attitude and complete lack of intimacy will heal with time.

I am on day 2 of CT (60 gpd) with the help of a low dose lope (tapering down from 20mg a day by 2mg each day) and D-8 (7.5mg) at night to assist with sleep. 

So far things have been bearable. Definitely some temperature issues and the awareness that something is missing from my routine. RLS has been minor and intermittent. Luckily it hasn't really struck me at night. Get sweats at night but that's not too unusual. 

Hopefully I can ride this out with my family being none-the-wiser and can move on past this phase of my life.

I began using Kratom in April/May of this past year to help manage anxiety. It soon after became a daily habit. I didn't track how much I was using each day for a while but at my peak around 5-7 grams (3-4 teaspoons) a day. I quit cold turkey in the fall and was very sick with flu-like symptoms and episodes of worsened anxiety, and mild depression. I resumed using after a couple weeks.

This has gone on for too long, so in the past week I started taking just \~3 grams per day (one teaspoon in the morning and one teaspoon after work). On days that I've skipped a dose, I begin to feel very anxious within 48 hours. I'm wondering if anybody can tell me the pace at which I should taper - should I start taking off .5 grams per day for a few days, and then reduce it further? Is that too fast or slow? Is it safe to do more? I really just want to stop using it altogether but I'm afraid of harsh withdrawals. I weigh about 140-150lbs so the relatively small amount still affects me. Thanks!",5,0

About a week ago I fell off my taper plan. There were days I easily dosed 40+g. Over the last few days struggled to get back on the plan. Simply put, get back on the rhythm using the successful formula that got me down from 50gpd (or more now that I think about it): 
- pre-weigh my daily doses in Tupperware salad dressing containers using a food scale to measure doses down to 1/10th of a g
- set phone timer and dose every 2.5 hours

I know I was down to a lower dosage before I fell but more than anything I wanted to get my rhythm back. Yesterday was a major success! I‚Äôll drop down a bit today. Biggest takeaway for me is this: falling off a taper plan does NOT mean having to start from scratch as long as you don‚Äôt allow yourself to stay off the plan too long. Get back on it.

Day 1 - not tough at all; had much motivation to get through even one day; cravings close to sleep but fatigue had set in for me so fast that by sleeping I squashed the cravings

Days 2-3 - the border to unfamiliar territory for a long time; still able to sleep fine (fatigue, klonopin, THC pen); but basically all the other normal acutes hit at once; the ""dont trust a fart"" rule comes into immediate and full effect, martial law declared for the digestive system; minor emotions beginning

Days 4-5 - sniffling and sneezing mostly went away, I have a stray sneeze here and there; body temp fluctuations have ratcheted way up and I often huddle at my desk with a space heater blasting me... feelsgoodman until I have to move, then shudder and sulk; crying more often

Day 6 - damn this fatigue! I averaged 13k steps per day in 2020 and it's hard for me to get even 5k right now... dafuq; surprised myself by being up to making a social call, going to a valentines day party at midnight... was a bad boy and had a small glass of champagne (alcohol was a problem in my 20s and early 30s, and I don't mess around with it anymore besides I take benzos now so yeah); crying even more often, at random stuff on tv like the past couple days, but now also mourning losses I've had in the past several years that I didn't mourn correctly then and here is my comeuppance beginning

Day 7 - if my energy level was at a 2.5/10 yesterday, it's at a 3/10 today... very low, but I felt some sort of small improvement

Day 8 (today) - and today the energy level is at least a 5/10, quite a jump... a week CT is uncharted territory for me and i'm feeling really good about it today... acutes lingering, but with the fatigue going away, idgaf about most of the other stuff, aside from rebound hypertension and vertigo, the second of which being my most annoying acute to deal with so far, but part of it may because I recently cut my antidepressant dose by 25% just a couple days before going CT on the K

&#x200B;

REALLY looking forward to what my experiences are in this second week.  I have a two day trip to the mountains on days 13 and 14 - at least I'll enjoy it instead of go, be a zombie, and have patchy memories of it in a month or two

 So, with that in mind, I figured I owed it to the community and myself to at least attempt a post. I'm just feeling really depressed and anxious and have avoided visiting with how I feel in an intimate manner.

Other thoughts:

I first went a full week without kratom a year ago from next weekend. I have to stick to this quit. A year is too much time to have spent suffering and miserable like I am. I've had it better than most but kratom has really taken a toll on my mental health and I spent almost all of 2020 in mental or physical agony. 
Therefore I'm going to do it this time. Got a gym membership today. I only worked out 2 days last week. I had a 5 workout goal. I think that's doable. Also cutting out alcohol. I figured why even take that chance of possibly sabotaging myself. I have a good book I'm enjoying too. 
Let's set ourselves up for success this week! And if you have any questions I'll try to answer them. Additionaly, any recommendations for my procedures are welcome as always.

I had my second and final motorcycle training course for my endorsement this morning. I mentioned before I don't go out and do anything usually, and definitely don't go for 40 minute drives. The drive to the first class yesterday was as anxiety-ridden as can be, but today I was way less anxious on the drive there. I knew what to expect, I knew where it was, etc. But riding the motorcycle for 4 hours yesterday I noticed was starting to make my back hurt (plus I was FREEZING the entire time)

Then today, I get out of my car to go to the staging area for the bikes, and I threw my back out on the walk over there. Don't even know how I did it, but there ya go. And plus today is the day of our taper drop in amounts. I didn't have my usual old thoughts ""well circumstances have changed, I can go back up in dose now since I have this extreme back pain, and then go back down when I'm ready"" The thought didn't even cross my mind. Don't get me wrong, I was dying to get to that next dose, but the addict in me no longer wants to take more. IN FACT, I'm considering dropping a little faster. I'll be apprehensive and cautious about that, and not beat myself up if I do go back up during that since I'll be weaning off of Xanax starting tomorrow. 

But we have a schedule and we stick to it, I just wonder if I would feel that much worse if I cut back a little more. They say slow and steady, and I'm already in a bad bad place very often throughout the day mentally with PAWS. But honestly, I really feel like if today wasn't a drop day for dosage, I kind of think I still would have felt just as awful. That's just my opinion, not tested yet. But shit, we dropped like 30 or so gpd basically overnight, and I didn't feel as bad back then, and that was 2 months ago... so maybe the tiny amount we are changing it by isn't as significant as I think and dropping faster wouldn't be as bad as we think, and then I can graciously get off this vile stuff sooner rather than later!

Oh, so I threw my back out, and it's been killing me, didn't want to move once I landed on the couch, but I did eventually get up, exercised, and then still went for a bike ride (even feeling like death, I can't stress enough how much listening to comedy and going for a bike ride makes a difference). Granted I cut the super uphill part of the ride I usually do out of it, I ain't trying to kill my back even more. But even if I did, I am so happy that my mind finally won't let me go up in dose just because my back is hurting more. Success!",2,0

I have a question about taper schedules (yes I've read all the stickies and also \~15 other taper-related threads).

**How important is it really that every single dose throughout the day be the same amount? Is it a big deal if, instead of 4g + 4g + 4g per day, I do 2g + 4g + 6g?**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In my specific case, my current daily total is **26g** spread across 6 doses that increase as the day passes: 2.5g + 3.5g + 4g + 4.5g + 5g + 6.5g.

To start the taper, I immediately cut the daily total by 1/3, so for the first week, I take **\~18g/day**, which \*should\* be 6 equal doses of 3g each. But I would really prefer to do, for example, 2.25g + 2.5g + 2.75g + 3g + 3.5g + 4g.

I know the logic behind uniform dosing is a ""steady level of alkaloids in the body"" but does it make that much of a difference since, in the end, the daily total is the same?

Am I going through withdrawals despite taking the pain meds, or is it withdrawal from the pain med? Or maybe this is just the arm alone keeping me from sleeping.

I have 20 people that work for me - that are counting on me to make it in to work tomorrow during a winter storm. And be the fearless leader and be calm and make good decisions. I have a wife who expects me to be a good husband and so cool things for Valentine‚Äôs Day. That is why I know I have relapsed so many times. I can buy just another 24 hours of energy and feel sorta of like myself if I take more Kratom. I know that the long term I will have more energy - get my memory back - all the good stuff - but I just can‚Äôt let myself be below - if slightly below all my other responsibilities. Like - if I was just sitting in the house by myself for a few weeks - this would be easy.

I had my chart and was taking an aggressive schedule and had the support of my wife, who has been there with me on various other ‚Äúlast times‚Äù on other drugs.  I was doing well until life got in the wife.  On 1/14 her father, my father in law, had a aneurism and died after being in the hospital fir other health reasons.  

Due to this ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù I told myself I had to ‚Äúbe there‚Äù for my wife and her family.  So like any good addict my solution was to ditch my tapering and start taking a ton of extracts daily.  Sometimes up to 10-12 daily.  It was an awful 2-3 weeks, and I do the one thing that can make it worse.  

Well on Friday night, my wife was giving our 7 month old daughter a bath, and after she took her out and was drying her off, she noticed my little girl had something in her hand.  It was a capsule of extract that had fallen out of my pocket the night before.  I thought I had taken it in the middle of the night when I woke up that next day.

Now I have had some personal low points, some bottoms that looked pretty bad, but ALMOST KILLING my own little angle disgusts me to even type it out...Turns my stomach in that way that I cannot believe I am writing.  I almost harmed the one thing I have sworn I would never hurt 

So, needless to say, I flushed the remaining capsules I had, flushed the powerder that I was ‚Äútapering‚Äù with and have gone CT.  

Woke up in sweats, body aches, but so far not terrible WD.  I know some of the worst is yet to come.  I have clonidine and seroquil (sp?) from my doc as he was part of the tapering plan, and I had used either while using the extracts.  I have ‚Äúthe shot‚Äù ordered to have the dr. administer to help me stay off of opioids.  

I just had to get this out there.  I had to admit I‚Äôm
Back at day 1, I‚Äôm scared cus I hate WD‚Äôs, I know the road ahead can be bumpy, but I have been brought to my knees.  If that little girl had taken that pill, god knows what my life looks like today.  ‚ÄúMessage received big guy!‚Äù

Just quit extracts on a whim about 5 days ago, using powder for now and going to taper from there but holy shit I was not expecting the extract switch to be so horrible.","I‚Äôm 31/f and I can‚Äôt believe it but I guess I‚Äôve been taken kratom for seven god damn
years. Almost all of that time I was using powder only, never good at measuring but approximately 15 GPD (a level teaspoon 5 or 6 times a day). Until COVID happened and somehow I turned that into an excuse to start buying these little headshop extracts (not The very common ones in the tiny curvy bottle but some other weird brand I can‚Äôt find a god damn thing about online). They were so much cheaper than the Other shots that I would buy multiples, and overtime that turned into a fucking $40/day habit (sometimes more). I was still taking the same amount of plain leaf I always have.

I didn‚Äôt even feel the extracts, really. Every day I would think ‚Äútoday is the last time I buy these, I don‚Äôt need them‚Äù, and of course it wasn‚Äôt. About a week ago I did just skip the headshop trip on a whim one day, and then the next day, too. Figured I already had cut the cord so I might as well just be done with them.

I bumped up the amount of plain leaf I was taking just a bit, a few doses becoming rounded teaspoons instead of level. But after a few days I started to feel increasingly horrible. Anxious like the world was ending, irritable, so physically fatigued that lifting the tea kettle felt like real work. Lots of crying. But I didn‚Äôt draw the connection right away, because I truly had not been honest with myself about how much kratom I was taking in those extract shots. 

Yesterday in a moment of panicked desperation I doubled a few of my plain leaf doses, and I started to feel like I could breathe and see clearly again. I‚Äôm so disappointed with myself for how mindlessly I took this addiction to a horrifying new level. And I look fucking terrible, my hair is thinning and my face is pale and puffy and I feel like my body is 80 years old. I want nothing to do with this plant anymore. I want my body and my mind back, and I fucking want my hair back. I developed acne for the first time in my life at age 30 and I want that shit gone, too. Maybe that‚Äôs not from the kratom but I have a feeling it is. I hate waking up in the morning feeling like I‚Äôm coming back from the dead - I didn‚Äôt quit drinking five years ago so that I could keep feeling hungover every day. 

I want my sex drive back, I want my freedom, I want to not feel ashamed every time I crouch in the break room dumping green powder down my throat.

I got a precise scale and I‚Äôm going to track and adjust to the dose I‚Äôm at now without extracts, and go down from there. I would love to hear from other folks who tapered from extracts + plain leaf to just plain leaf, and anything that helped.

I appreciate this group.,"I was a semi-heavy Kratom user for over two years. Averaging 20-30 gpd, after being a light user for 4-5 years. I was a user, and also a stubborn ambassador for the plant. It helped with all of the daily struggles you all are familiar with. Social interaction, depression, anxiety, energy etc. It even helped me kick a bad drinking habit. I truly believed in its benefits, and in my ignorance, refused to research any negative side effects. I would recommend it to people with opioid addictions, severe pain, or whenever it felt right to introduce it to someone. I really believed it was a ‚Äúmiracle plant.‚Äù 

Fast forward to November 19th, 2020. I had just started my daily 3 mile walk with my girlfriend. Obviously dosed beforehand, because it ‚Äúalways helps generate intriguing conversations.‚Äù The walk begins, and not even a hundred feet from my house, I drop. I wake up, my girlfriend crying over me with two neighbors helping to keep her calm. I had a full Grand Mal Seizure. I was twisting and jerking, foam and blood from a busted lip coming from my mouth. An ambulance was on its way, and I was terrified. She was terrified. 

Fast forward again; Tuesday, February 9th 2021. I had undergone a CT, MRI, and EEG tests. Thankfully, everything came back unremarkable/negative. In Maryland, when you have a seizure, you‚Äôre not allowed to operate a vehicle for 90 days - seizure free. This means acquiring Kratom was a regular stresser because I relied on my girlfriend/family/Uber constantly. I was open with my Neurologist about everything before my EEG exam. He is a neurologist at Johns Hopkins, and told me to quit Kratom. 

Now for the mental gymnastics I jumped through to manipulate myself and my loved ones so I could continue using. Everybody wanted me to quit, and my mother who also used to work at Johns Hopkins cited his response to my Kratom use. I had the audacity to argue that he, a neurologist at Johns Hopkins, didn‚Äôt know what he was talking about. I continued to use, until the day my EEG results came back. I was at work, already worrying about how I was going to acquire more K as I was running low. I got an email from my Neurologist; 

‚ÄúHi, The EEG was normal. 
 
Please do not take Kratom as it may trigger seizures‚Äù (Copy/paste from the email.)

He went on to cite medical studies on Kratom and its affiliation with seizures. I was angry at first, even thought my mother had contacted him asking for him to send that to me. 

That‚Äôs when I found this subreddit, simply by googling Kratom and Seizures. I was shocked at how many people here have gone through similar experiences, or worse. I became anxious, reading about the withdrawals and how tough it can be. However, the amount of positive reinforcement I read inspired me. I did not buy anymore Kratom that day. I quit CT. In the past five days, I‚Äôve gone through a myriad of WD symptoms discussed in this group. Cloudy head, headaches, restlessness, irritability, anxious, heart palpitations, diarrhea, and intense cravings. I‚Äôm not caving, though. 

Long story short, I had a serious wakeup-call and without the information and support I‚Äôve seen in this group, I‚Äôm not sure if I would have made the decision to quit.

This one‚Äôs sticking, I can feeeeel it. I still have easy access to kratom but no desire to use it. I did have a dream a couple of nights ago that I was at a mall & took 4 grams of kratom & as soon as I got it down I ran up to an employee & asked them for ipecac syrup. Spent the rest of my dream in a mall bathroom puking. Been having lots of dreams & welcome all of them (except for one nightmare on night 2 that involved a bit of sleep paralysis & absolutely freaked me the f out).

My usage was about 40-50GPD for somewhere between 5 & 6 years. I tapered down to 8GPD over 4 months and jumped on 2/3 at 7:44PM

Day 1 wasn‚Äôt so bad, but days 2-3 were the worst. Anhedonia (a word I did not truly understand the meaning of before) & lethargy were the worst part IMO. Would sometimes take me 30min to convince myself to get up and get something to eat/refill my water bottle. Hot/cold sweats & goose flesh were annoying (I took maybe 5 hot baths mixed with cold showers when I could stand it a day to just feel normal for a bit on those two days) and insomnia sucked but I knew it was going to happen so just gave myself the thumbs up to lay in bed & watch TV for hours on end. I also noticed my face was producing a lot of oil on those days (a welcome return). From day 2 to day 5ish my lips, mouth, nose & throat (what felt like my throat all the way down to my collarbone) were insanely dry. Despite drinking plenty of water & Gatorade. That was a bit unexpected for me but seems to have subsided (no idea if I still wasn‚Äôt drinking enough/was drinking too much/maybe it was a side effect of something I was taking). I still sneeze like 40 times a day but it just kind of makes me giggle. The joy that is music is coming back. My bf added me to his Spotify account maybe 1-2 years ago & I never touched it. Music just wasn‚Äôt appealing to me, I preferred to always have a show on in the background instead for whatever reason (likely to escape from life/not think about anything involving me for awhile) but the past few days I‚Äôve been listening while working out, making food, driving, etc & it‚Äôs been amazing. Rediscovering songs I‚Äôve forgotten about over the past half decade, many which have been taking me back to moments I‚Äôd also forgotten about & making me really happy. Sex drive is also coming back which is fun. I‚Äôve had severely swollen lymph nodes for awhile now. They are getting smaller though they are still there, but I‚Äôm hopeful in a few weeks to be able to say they are no longer swollen.

The physical symptoms still come in waves though they are tolerable. I am preparing that most of the rest of these few months will mostly be mental & planning accordingly. 

Thanks to everyone in this community. I check in multiple times a day & maybe comment way too much sometimes but it‚Äôs been awesome to be able to read everyone‚Äôs experiences & talk about my own. No doubt if this sub didn‚Äôt exist I‚Äôd most likely be shoveling kratom into my face somewhere in this world.

I‚Äôve told myself every which way for the past 4 years at least (once quitting crossed my mind) that I could never do it. Tried & failed, always caved. For me the only real difference between then & now is that this go around I reaaaally wanted it. Back then sure it sounded like a good idea but honestly I still thought everything I was doing was ‚Äúfine‚Äù. Made a plan, quit my job (have been fortunate enough to find another one that doesn‚Äôt start for a few more weeks at least), & accepted that it was going to take me at least half a year to get back to some semblance of normalcy.

My habit was 60gpd and included drinking 10 to 20 drinks a day. Also included taking adderall at various times.
    I really have to say it wasn't as bad as I expected. The worst part was not sleeping which I contributed a lot to the stress of being in jail worrying if I was going to lose my job and my home etc. I had some cold sweats, hot flashes. Now mind you, I cold turkeyed 150mg methadone before in 2018 so kratom detox is like someone detoxing off a few Vicodin compared to a heavy heroin user. Once you've come off hard opiates, it's not so bad. I was also coming off a heavy drinking habit.Just my theory, as someone whose been on other opiates. 
     I bonded out on condition I wear alcohol monitor and so I haven't drank since February 5th which I'm very happy. The night I got out I got home, saw my bag of kratom in my room, and of course I took a scoop. So Friday and Saturday took about 15gpd. I hadn't slept and I hate that I took it the last two days.  After 6 days free. The hard part is knowing it's everywhere. After experiencing minimal withdrawal I'm going to go cold turkey again this week. 
      Progress though. I know it can be done. Just have to stay strong. Be strong. Get in that mindstate that it's not a way to live and it's expensive. Costs me thousands a year. I make 22k a year. I can't afford this shit. I could have saved thousands in a savings account or bought things to better my life. Just pissing and scooping my hard earned money away. Good luck",9,0

I recently stopped Kratom for so many reasons, physical and psychological.

One key reason that is very tough is I was using it to tolerate a relationship that I should have left long ago.

Nice person so it's heartbreaking.  I tried to break up last summer (while off Kratom), but was pressured and went back and got back on Kratom.

I have to stay strong. But it's so hard to hurt people.  And I have terrible anxiety.

Should I consider Naltrexone/Vivitrol/Antabuse to cut off getting high all together?,"&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I managed to stay clean for a short bit, but it never lasts. My brain is just to used to a drug induced dopamine spike/increase after 11 years on and off drug abuse. It expects some type of high/buzz and staying 100% sober, feels outright impossible to me. I tried I can't seem to do it. The silver lining here is, **I haven't relapsed on Kratom**. Instead I'm on alcohol now which in my opinion is much worse physical health wise. This I saw coming.

Drank a fifth of vodka in 24 hours. Which I think is pretty alarming. I try to limit my usage but like Kratom, it never works out that way. I do not have control with anything that gets me high. It's just another step in the cycle of addiction.

Should I consider medications that completely block any highs you can get from Opiates/alcohol. Specifically naltrexone pills/Vivitrol injection (opiate & alcohol antagonists) or Antabuse (anti-alcohol agent) The naltrexone/Vivitrol injection 100% block any psychoactive effects from Kratom and alcohol, so there is no reinforcing ""reward"" for using either types of drugs, no high can be achieved while on these meds.

Does anyone here have any experience or testimonials from any of those medications (Vivitrol injection/Naltrexone?",1,0

And we are dropping 1.4 grams every 5 days, instead of 1.2

Woke up at 2, maybe went back to sleep for a tiny bit but wide awake at 3. No surprise there, I get up at 2:30 for work and have for the better part of the last decade. But my first dose isn't until 4am, and I didn't have work this morning to keep my mind off of things.. plus I had to pee really bad but didn't want to get up. You guys ever have that? Where when you have to urinate really bad it seems to make your withdrawals worse? 

Well anyways, today was my motorcycle riding training course. I am a super introvert, and was upside down with anxiety about it, and just going out in general. It's a 40 minute drive to there from my house, and my usual commute is 4 minutes to my work. Long drives are not for someone in my mental condition as of late. Anyways I took the course, skin crawling and back feeling like it was on fire by the end of it. The guys were nice, I told them I had to take ""medication"" at a specific time, and they let me go out to my car. I took the Xanax before I left to come home (usually takes an hour to kick in), and had a bad bad panic attack on the drive home that got worse and worse as I waited for my next dose to try to take a nap. I fucking hate kratom the most because I feel pressured to wait to do things, or speed up things based off of when my next dose is. 

Well I actually fell asleep, heart pounding and mind racing with extremely unhealthy existential thoughts, and I actually fell asleep (panic attacks drain the absolute shit out of me, so that makes sense) Then I woke up and I felt BETTER, like way better. And I don't think that's just the xanax talking, I have been taking it for a month now, and I don't usually feel great on it, just loopy. In fact I have had some bad panic attacks anyways while I was on the damn stuff, and very recently too... SO I am starting to believe that I am screwing myself over by taking the Xanax, and ruining my chance of healing anyways by letting my mind get numb by something else... and that I am going through kratom AND xanax withdrawals by midday, which is why I have been feeling so shitty around noon. So I am going to start weaning off of that now too, but pretty positive spirits about it. My mom is a nurse and said it shouldn't be too hard to cut back. I have only been taking .5mg per day, and only for a month. But seriously, if you guys can try to get a nap in, wow I think that makes the biggest difference for the emotional side of PAWS. It's like my dumb brain gets a hard reset, and being that I am awake for almost 18 hours straight after getting up at 2:30, I need it.

Well that's all for now, so so happy to have ""normal"" great feelings like today, especially after how horrible I felt before that, it's crazy. But here's to continuing the taper and eventually getting to a point where I am feeling like that (almost) all the time! Oh, went for a strenuous bike ride after the nap, felt awesome, no anxiety :) So happy to have the support of this sub and my awesome wife!",2,0

I take more than I should, about 20-30g, but honestly I haven't had basically any negative effects that would force me to stop.

I work 40+ hours a week, I work hard, I get great sleep, I have a decent diet (could eat healthier) and my overall personality and emotions isn't all dampened. Only thing is I get more headaches more often.

However, I feel like I do need to stop simply because of how much money I'm blowing on it. I spend around 300 a month at most, which is starting to add up.

Now to the point: I feel like I have to quit simply for the money aspect. I'm moving into a much nicer, expensive apartment, and if I keep this habit going it'll really effect my monthly income . Also, the 6 or so months I stopped I felt a little better and more hyper but nothing too different. 

I'm definitely addicted. I get withdrawals, cravings, and a short temper when I stop it, but it's not destroying my life in anyway.

It's hard to me to make that jump and power thru to quit when there's no major push to do it, the pricing would make me save a lot but it wont prevent me from moving to the new place.

Idk, not sure why I'm posting this, maybe to get advice on what makes withdrawals easier and manageable, because I'm the end I know I should quit.

I‚Äôve been wanting to for a long time but the anxiety makes it so hard- I started microdosing about 200mg of mushrooms daily a couple weeks back and and my kratom consumption had gone way down. I was dosing every 3 hrs and sometimes had anxiety even in between that time- which I used kratom to calm. 

Psilocybin mushrooms have a crazy long list of benefits and while I understand the hang ups of trading one vice for another- I fruity don‚Äôt think the 200mg is a negative due to the benefits of such a small dose. 
Just an idea- I know quitting is crazy hard and I wanted to share what‚Äôs been working for me. Best of luck to everyone!",32,0
458,2021-02-12 21:42:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/lirdii/day_9_ct_work_today_was_the_biggest_mental/,"Day 9 CT. Work today was the biggest mental struggle I've faced yet, cravings flared up. Was going to make a post before on here for moral support but was too busy even on my ""breaks""","Just 4 hours in all I could think is ""If I had a few grams of Kratom in me, everything would be so much easier, more energy, less back pain, more motivation"" This repeated in my mind repeatedly until I was ready vomit from anxiety, quit my job and go cry in my car while driving home back to bed to curl up in a ball. Work stress is immensely painful to deal with in early recovery from Kratom.

My department in my workplace (Poultry processing facility Central North Carolina) is severely understaffed due to COVID. Many people are out of work forced into quarantine because they came up positive (2 people here died last May from COVID). Dozens of people at least are out for now, hundreds are probably carrying the bug out of 2,900 employees. The virus is making it's rounds. I was sick with it while withdrawing from Kratom just 1-2 weeks ago, so that was **extremely** unpleasant to endure even while off work for 14 days quarantine. Still have breathing issues but mostly recovered.

Due to missing staff the  workload went from somewhat manageable to insanely stressful. The factory lines were kept running at full speed even with staff missing so everyone had to bust ass. If the workload wasn't kept up every other second, the superintendent made sure to get on everyones ass slacking within eyesight. Not mine I worked as hard as possible, but still. Stress = cravings for Kratom. I know Kratom will help me work faster and even harder, in a more chipper mood perhaps instead of depressed with decreased dopamine levels... but at what cost? Is it really worth it going back? No.

But I somehow survived. I'm not sure how but once again I am ready to mark another day down. I have the weekend off thankfully so **Monday at 5am start time, I'll have 11.5 days sober. End of the day will be Day 12 (Quit Wednesday Feb 3rd 5:00PM EST )**

Please tell me it will get easier! Recovering from Kratom would be so much easier if I could just stay home for 100 days straight. :/",41,5

I‚Äôve been avoiding posting but also super busy working and catching up with so much crap I put off doing due to major procrastination while using Kratom.
I had my 2nd Covid vaccine ( in healthcare) and felt like shit last Friday.  They said no ibuprofen so I took Tylenol and got 2 Kratom tablets.  I took it so impulsively... 
i felt great for 10 minutes then felt guilty as shit!  It was scary how impulsive it was and it definitely made my addict think, ‚Äú See, I CAN use once‚Äù which is bullshit.....   So it‚Äôs been one week and thankfully it didn‚Äôt fuck up my life and I don‚Äôt want more.  ‚Äú One is too many and a thousand never enough‚Äù has been my mantra  all week.  
I knew if I didn‚Äôt post I‚Äôd be secret keeping which only leads to shame and self-loathing... I also realized I posted almost daily which kept me sober!  I read a lot of the threads of withdrawals, hair-loss etc.. and it was a constant reminder of why I wanted/needed to stay clean.  I think that also contributed to my impulsivity ( not checking in or being accountable to myself and all of you). 
Opiate addiction is really difficult!  I consider Kratom to be legal heroin.  
I am grateful to all of you in this group!!!  
PS. I did take ibuprofen on Saturday and it worked amazingly well for my flu-like symptoms ( which sucked btw) 
Hope you are all doing well!   This addiction business is insidious though, that is for sure!!!!  We are never out of the woods!

Also I noticed my days are inconsistent on my posts, so I checked our logs and December 20th was when we started measuring and recording doses... so I rescind my dates that I've posted.

But I feel I have made some real progress. Preface that with yesterday and today I had some of the worst panic attacks yet, but I'm not as scared of them as I was not too long ago. Mentally this is part of the healing... They DO go away. Bike riding helps, getting easier and easier to gather the motivation to get off the couch and jump on the bike. I put on my headphones and listen to my favorite comedians, Brian Regan, Jim Gaffigan, Robert Schimmel, Daniel Tosh, Louis CK, and Doug Stanhope (his shit gets a little dark which sometimes makes me feel worse lol).

A little backstory, my body HEALS. My wife and I joke about how I am like wolverine from X Men because of how fast my body heals when I am hurt. I have a really healthy diet, we cook fresh dinners every night, no high fructose corn syrup, no preservatives, no soda, no sugar really. But my brain does NOT heal as fast. I think this is the case with many addicts. I worry about what life will be like without the numbness of kratom, and all of you say it's amazing. I kind of don't want amazing, I like the numbness... I'm not looking for mind shattering objective realization that a leaf on a tree is astounding. That being said, these bike rides I mentioned before, and it's getting even more noticeable, the SMELL of nature. I feel like I can smell things so strongly, trees, the crisp air, even the dead animal somewhere off the side of the road. I feel like I can smell the exhaust fumes from a car a block away.

All that to say, physical withdrawals are a breeze for me which I am grateful for, minus the crawling skin when I am going through a panic attack (or maybe the crawling skin starts me off on the panic attack, hmmmm). I know I'm taking Xanax to get over the panic attacks that seem to come even when I am on it, but I plan to get off that too. But the PAWS man, they are hitting and hitting hard. I think we can all agree that sometimes PAWS can be harder than the physical withdrawals, and in my case that's very true. TIME, that's what everyone says is the solution for PAWS, and time inevitably is what I am giving it. I am NOT giving up. Life on the other side will be better, even for someone who loves being bland like me. My councelor says I need to rekindle my old interests. Like I had no old interests. Make it through my shift and then chill for 8 hours, that was my thing. That's why kratom was so spectacular for me. 

But I am happy to say that I am down to 19.6 grams per day from around 70 for years (soon to be 18.2 starting tomorrow), and have no intentions of relapsing to a higher dose. My councelor says to give myself a pat on the back for not giving in and going back up in dose, to which I said maybe a half pat, because even if I take more, these waves of panic come back and strong, so it wouldn't even help if I took more.

Tomorrow I take the riding course to get the motorcycle endorsement for my license, I'm pretty stoked but I'm worried about how I'm going to take my doses while I am there... yet another in the long list of things I can't wait to not have to worry about anymore

Well anyways if you made it down the read this far I thank you! Sorry this is so long, but like it does for most of us, getting stuff off my chest makes me feel better.",2,0

I got 9hrs of sleep last night and had a great day at work. That's a huge difference in attitude over say, 6 months ago. I used to HATE doing everything. I can't believe how bad my attitude was, quite frankly.

I've also been able to constructively deal with a divorce after a a decade long relationship. When I quit, I knew if I kept on the same route with kratom I would've destroyed myself. Thank God for that moment of clarity. Life is much, much better.

Did quitting suck? Yeah, a bit. It did. But I approached it as a challenge more than anything else and that mindset really worked for me. I was depressed for a few weeks, but that subsided. I regularly exercise, have seen incredible physical benefits and generally have a decent mood day by day.

So I descided to try a rapid taper which basically consisted of me stretching out my dosage lengths and decreasing the amounts until I couldnt take it anymore.  This afforded me the oppurtunity to recognize what my WDs would be and I really stretched myself thin.  Now im down to only dosing at night about 4 to 6  grams for sleep with minimal WDs between doses.  Now with the 3 day weekend starting I'm finishing up my addiction CT style.  My last dose was last night @8pm (22hrs prior to me writing this).  Lets see how this goes.  So far my WD symptoms I experience daily right before I dose is runny nose, crying(very rare and unprovoked), anxiety, and occasionally a headache.  Althought these seem like unbearable symptoms they aren't terrible when we tell ourselves it's all a mind game.  My anxiety was getting so bad I thought I was dieing and had terrible health problems, now i know its just anxiety I can lean into it and talk myself out of it like a bad trip.  With me rating my symptoms with 1-being im normal and 10-being suicidal homicidal I am a 2 right now.

I haven't been on this sub for years... Over 2 years ago I quit a 2 year addiction. I was using about 15-20 gpd. After quitting I had a short phenibut addiction, but then knocked that and life had been great. Unfortunately I found myself on phenibut again not too long ago (Tapering currently). I was using 2.5-3.5 gpd. I'm down to 500mg before bed on the phenibut, but unfortunately slipped up and began using Kratom to aid the taper. My addict mind really thought I could control it. I would use for a couple weeks then take several days off and wasn't getting WDs. I want to say I've been using Kratom now for 3 months top probably more around 2-2.5 months but my memory is hazy from the phenibut and Kratom. 

I was dosing around 3 times a day  with doses of 3.8-4g So 11.5 to 12 gpd. Now my doses are around 3.5-3.7 (10.5 to 11gpd) for the last couple weeks. When I first quit I cut down to around this dosing range and cold turkey'd. It wasn't pleasant at all and took multiple attempts since I'd relapse around 30-50 days at the latest. I know I haven't been using for that long so it shouldn't be that bad, but I've heard if you've withdrawal'd before from Kratom it can be just as bad or worst the second time regardless of the time being shorter??

One thing that worries me is I'm not fully off the phenibut but I do seem to be pretty stable at this dose and it hasn't been to bad. Just hard to tell which negative effects are from the phenibut or the Kratom. 

Any advice or comments would be greatly appreciated! I remember how amazing this community was a couple years ago. During that first quit my mom had cancer and then passed away right after I quite and all of you guys were amazingly supportive.

Edit: I‚Äôm thinking of suspending my Phenibut taper while I quit kratom. I‚Äôll stay at 500mg for the first 4 nights I‚Äôm off Kratom probably and then resume. I plan on taking my last kratom dose tomorrow afternoon. I just have enough for a morning and afternoon dose.",4,0

I am crying so much I am seeing things I never saw or felt before that I am sure were being suppressed by Kratom for those 4 years.  So now I have much healing to do mentally.  First I have to let it all out.  So I am confining myself for the weekend to just me, God and all my skills to let out all I am feeling. Then I will do the forgiving and then work on making a new life for myself where I am in control and I do what is best for me.  It is very scary but I have to believe in myself because I have all the skills. I have been through much worse and made it through everything I was challenged with.  This time is a little scarier because I am disabled and much older before I had youth and health so nothing scared me that much.

What do you guys think: Does detox (without psychotherapy or anything just shielded environment for detoxing) make sense if I am already 2 weeks plus clean and have psychotherapy set up for me?

Thank you guys so much for your support and keep on fighting, you got this!",12,0

I went to a primary care physician to seek some sort of help for withdrawals and all he wanted to do was give me subs. I don‚Äôt want to quit an opiate with another opiate. I mentioned gaba to him and told him the anecdotal stories I had heard and he said he can‚Äôt imagine why people would use gaba for kratom withdrawals. He said it‚Äôs normally use to treat RLS. And I told him that RLS is one of my worst withdrawal symptoms. He insisted on the subs and wouldn‚Äôt discuss the gaba any longer. I‚Äôve only just recently got health insurance for the first time in my adult life (at age 30). I‚Äôm not experienced at going to doctors. What type of doctor do I need to go to in order to get treatment for this? The primary care physician I went to made it seem like it was extremely strange that I was coming there asking for help.

Edit: I just tried a different doctor. I told him that RLS is the main withdrawal symptom that is holding me back. And I told him that I‚Äôve heard anecdotal instances of people having a lot of success with gabapentin. He said that he would never prescribe gabapentin to someone who has a proven history of abusing substances.

Does anyone have any ideas, anything at all, as far as supplements go to help me quit kratom? I‚Äôve been using for a year and a half (as high as 80gpd but currently I‚Äôm down to about 40 gpd). I‚Äôve got some CBD oil on its way to me so hopefully that will work.",5,0

I've had issues with painkillers and methadone in the past and have detoxed cold turkey from all of them more than once so I figured Kratom was nothing.

About 2 weeks ago I couldn't afford to get some and got to feel the beginning DTs and it scared me. I've been taking 4 tps about every 2 hours the past 6 months.

Today I went to my doctor and asked to be put on Subutex for a short time to taper; Don't judge me, Subutex is free, Kratom takes all my spare money and sometimes bill money. I told him I was using Subutex already off-and-on to keep from drinking alcohol and I didn't go into much detail about my Kratom use. BIG MISTAKE!!!!

He refused to write the Subutex and told me it isn't used to treat alcohol dependency, but NALTREXONE is. That's great, I can have one medication block both alcohol and Kratom? It's a miracle! Not so fast!!

I went and picked up the Naltrexone at Walgreens, picked my daughter up, and headed to the grocery store. I took my first dose of Naltrexone in my car in the parking lot before I went into shop around 5PM. I had no idea what was lurking literally 10 min away.

Turns out there's a little thing called Naltrexone Precipitated Hyper Acute Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome, I should have read the freaking paperwork or researched the medication. 10 Min after I took the first dose I broke out in an intense cold sweat, my vision got glassy, and I started feeling this weird Tingling all over my body, especially my legs. I got just a few things and hurried to the car feeling extremely anxious and worried about what was going on, that was just the beginning!

The drive home was scary, the pain and tingling was getting exponentially worse, my eyes were glassy and I was seeing flashes of light. When I pulled up to my Dad's I jumped out, got my daughter, and headed straight inside. By this time it was starting to get really intense, I was in a full-blown panic, even somewhat dissociative. The pain was bad over every inch of my body, inside and out. I was drenched in sweat, had only about 60% vision, the other 40% felt like an alternate dimension, I was terrified and defenseless. The Tingling was intense and I would go from feeling like I was a boiling pressure cooker to an Eskimo with no clothes over and over.

I asked my dad and step mom to help with my daughter and they immediately obliged. I explained to them what happened at the store and told them I was feeling beyond terrible. I immediately started looking up info when all of a sudden it went from 50 to 100.

I know I was delirious most of it. Frantically moving from the back porch to the living room couch in a half aware panic. The pain was beyond severe, the intense tingling was all over my body, my stomach was knotted up and I yawned uncontrollably. I kept trying to calm down, relax, and ride it out, but I wasn't completely sure what was going on. It was the most intense mixture of severe symptoms coilessing into an urgent acute health crisis. I lost track of time, I rarely knew where I was or what I was doing, I was stuck in absolute hell. I dry heaved for a good 20 min at one point, sneezed and coughed uncontrollably and it hurt to pee, really strange stuff, but all of that was hard to think about over how I felt and how my brain was working.

There was several times I almost asked to be taken to the emergency room. I thought about my first detox from methadone: 75mg/day for 3 years cold turkey! It sucked but it wasn't anywhere near what I was experiencing, not even in the same universe.

It has since subsided substantially. I'm writing this at 2:59AM, I have to wake up at 5:30AM for work, I feel like I've been hit by a truck and I can't sleep. There's still lingering pain & achyness, I'm sure I'm not sleeping tonight. I'm going to keep strong despite wanting to kill my doctor for not warning me about the nature of the medication, that was hell on earth, I'll never forget! All of the other times I've withdrawed from highly addictive substances combined don't come even close to what I experienced for close to 8 hours last evening.

In other words...QUIT NOW and never take an opioid receptor antagonist until after you've tapered down to a couple days clean at least! My stupidity and arrogance towards Kratom has taught me a lesson.",6,0

I smoked pot for about 5 years and recently decided to finally quit. Wasn't hard at all cause I wanted too. Same with nicotine I quit for a bit and I realized I liked it and didn't notice any depreciation in life on it. The vaping and juices and building coils it's like a hobby so I decided to get back into it. But this is hard.. I only took it for work and didn't take any after or my days off. Idk how it turned into this but Im taking nearly 40gpd and when I try to ween down and successfully get to around 10gpd it just takes me back to the original feelings I once gotten from it and end up taking more and more to keep replicating it. I want to quit.. I try and tell my self im only 20 I haven't been on anything almost my entire life it's possible to be happy with out a drug. Im losing hair I wake up multiple times every night I get tired in the middle of the day. So many reasons to quit way more than pot and I so easily quit that. But why not this why is this so different. Is there anything to take that releases serotonin or makes your mood better. Im not gonna trade one addiction for another. I was thinking about micro dosing LSD, just something so im not dead sober thinking about my next cup of green sludge while im bored on the couch.

Day X starts late at night and I have a strange sleeping schedule to boot. Anyway, I‚Äôll be at 48 hours in less than an hour and I‚Äôm going strong. 

But why I‚Äôm posting this is because I leapt across a huge hurdle today. 

Of course as I‚Äôm 3-4 days in to this, my old Sub plug calls. Called five times in a row while I was asleep. One call would have been ignored. Five calls and my humanity kicks in and I consider there may be an emergency. See, he‚Äôs also a friend of mine. Who also happens to work at the store I have bought my kratom for so long. He would sell it to me so cheap... anyway... this is another awful thing to mix - friends with dealers... but that‚Äôs for another post. 

And lo and behold, the part of me that knew I was wrong to call back was, of course, right. 

Me: yo man something wrong, you called five times 

Plug: anon I haven‚Äôt seen you in awhile I figure you must be hurting... I got 20 subs... 

Me: I‚Äôm not trying to ignore you, I told you the last time I got subs that it was to help get off of kratom (it didn‚Äôt) 

Plug: they‚Äôre the pills you like to crush up

Anyway I said no I‚Äôm going about this without any sort of opioid to help and it turned into a guilt trip about how he‚Äôs stuck with them and has to eat the cost. 

I turned it on his head though. I told him to hold on to them for himself and his wife. They‚Äôre both oxy and kratom addicts as well, and I told him that this could be a blessing in disguise. And that I would write out a taper plan for them overnight and bring it to him in the morning.

But I know... the dude sells kratom all day so there‚Äôs no hope for him if he isn‚Äôt committed. I‚Äôm half tempted to tell him about the wrong way to use these subs if he really wants to get high, but I‚Äôm not that mean. I‚Äôd feel more confident about a taper plan for him if he‚Äôd gotten strips. 

Anyway. 

tl;dr my friend/kratom dealer/sub plug called me tonight to say he got a bunch of subs for me (right toward the end of my day four) and I didn‚Äôt consider for a moment going to get them. Who am I?! Normally I‚Äôd have snorted 8mg by now. Then I asked him to trust me and I‚Äôm going to try to help him use them to stop kratom and taper down to clean time.

Its possible,"I took kratom mostly capsule form and green strain for 2 1/2 years daily with no prior opioid use. Kratom took over my life. At first I thought I found a miracle drug that helped with my depression, work (I am a construction worker who does heavy physical labor), back pain, and creativity but by the end of it all it did the exact opposite. It made me unhealthy, constantly bloated due to digestive issues, unsociable due to mood swings, lack of sex drive. I had to bring it with me everywhere I went and if I forgot it I would freak out. Before I stopped taking kratom I was taking about 30 capsules a day. By the end of it I was no longer taking it to get high, I was just trying to stay away from withdrawals. Kratom took over my life. So last Monday I just woke up and decided today was going to be the day I quit cold turkey. Keep in mind I just got my wisdom teeth taken out a few days prior so I was already suffering from hunger and nicotine withdrawal. And my boss still wanted me to work to keep me active during this mostly so he can make sure I don't relapse. The first day was terrible but I strived through it. The second and third day were the worst. I had insane body aches, anxiety, depression, fever, tremors, heat flashes, nausea, and chills that I would relate to the same feeling you feel when youre coming up on ""shrooms'. I highy recommend taking Aleve and ibuprofen during physical withdrawals because it helps A LOT. At night I took prescribed hydroxyzine to go to sleep otherwise I wouldnt have been able to. I had the most vivid and real nightmares along with waking up randomly with restless arm syndrome. By the 4th day the physical symptoms started to subside and by the 5th day they were almost completely gone. Still to this day (day 10) I am dealing with cravings, depression, brain fog and anxiety but I feel better everyday. I just want to let you guys know its very possible to quit. Your mind will play tricks on you and make you feel youll never be happy again without it. Don't believe it. Getting through the first 3 days is the hardest part. The joy of not relying on kratom anymore is like a weight off your shoulders. Now I do believe kratom should still be legal and it does have good purposes (prior addiction and chronic pain) but if you dont suffer from these please be cautious and use sparingly if at all",18,0

The last week I had been feeling pretty great(relative to the three weeks prior), mild anxiety but tolerable, finally sleeping normally(6 to 8 hours a night, minimal RLS). Then what seemed like out of no where I started experiencing excessive tiredness, like ready to go to bed once I hit 1 pm despite caffeine and rhodiola. I slept 9 hours last night and I didnt want to get out of bed. I don't feel bad at all, just like Im naturally exhausted and I could sleep for like 12 hours easy (I know a lot of y'all are still having trouble sleeping, and I feel your pain, I was there during the length of my taper period and my first two weeks). But this feels different than the anhedonia did/does where I just felt spent and I didn't want to do anything but wasn't necessarily sleepy. Been going on for about 3 days now. I had been taking SAMe for serotonin support, cut my dose last night to no effect. I also have been using an alpha-gpc/uridine/dha combo in the afternoons for brain fog which has helped immensely.

I had attempted to make a post about 8 days in but it got lost and I didn't really have the energy to write it all out again at the time. I hope this isn't too long, I will try to drop as much info as I can while trying to remain brief.

For those starting out, if you're reading this, I promise that you can do this. It's going to suck, real bad. But as I've seen others say on here, you have to ""embrace the suck"". The welcome thread at the top will give you all kinds of valuable information to help you feel as okay as you can on your journey.

So. I just wanted to share my story here because reading the experiences of others were the only semblance of accepting withdrawal as a normal experience.

I suffer from borderline personality disorder, generalized anxiety, and depression. (And getting off kratom is showing me that most of my issues lie in post-traumatic stress). My early twenties‚Äîup until 26‚ÄîI was a full blown addict drinking and taking anything I could get my hands on.

Almost 5 years ago, being totally at the end of my rope, I checked into a crisis center because I could not handle the life I was living anymore. I got off drugs and alcohol, onto meds and felt better but after a few years they were doing more hurt than help and I jumped off of them and ended up finding kratom. I liked the way kratom made me feel. It fixed many of my focus issues and made me feel euphoric.

I used it for 3 years leading up to 35 days ago strictly in powder tea form. For the first two years, I had rules. I'd never have more than maybe 5gpd. I was able to go a day or so without it, only feeling sad if I didn't have it. When covid 19 hit and my life totally changed, I started just taking as much kratom as I could in a day. Which was probably about 12-15gpd. Come November 2020. I jumped onto a different brand/vein because I wanted to ""feel"" more. From then until the beginning of January I was taking 30+gpd, maybe. I don't even know. I didn't even realize what I had been taking until I started to have issues.

At the beginning of this year, I felt great mentally, or so I thought. I felt well enough to not drink as much kratom. Que the panic attacks. It started on Sunday 01/03/21. I was trying to fall asleep and the moment I did, I jolted awake convinced that if I slept, my body would stop breathing because I couldn't trust it to do it's job. Que the horrible insomnia. You can't sleep if you can't trust your body to breathe when your unconscious. This goes on for a few days. I get a few hours in. I'm still using kratom but not as much as I had been. And when I did use the kratom, it was not helping. Wednesday 01/06/21 I was having a work meeting, casually slamming kratom and I get my first full-blown panic attack in the day: shaking limbs, lump in my throat, sweating, convinced I'm going to pass out at any moment.

Even then, it still took me one more day to figure out kratom was doing it to me. And the next day, I jumped off CT with no knowledge of this forum and no knowledge that what I had been taking for so long was actually something way more sinister than the miracle tea I believed it to be.

The first day I felt crappy. I was barely getting any sleep at all. But I still tried to make my life work despite the lack of sleep. I was really starting to panic at night time because I knew I had to try to sleep and I knew what was going to happen. The second day the physical withdrawals start: shakes, chills, stomach sickness, aches and pains. Sitting on the floor of the shower really helped. Que the panic attacks in so full force that I feel like I am dying. It went on for hours without any reprieve. So totally freaked out about going to the hospital in the time of the coronavirus, but feeling like I am actually going to die, I walked to the closest ER (thankfully only a handful of blocks from me). I got seen. I had to explain kratom to them. At the end of the ordeal, I was sent home will a clean bill of health (blood, heart, O2) and a med to calm down. The med made my body really tired, but it didn't do a thing for my mind. And I really started to lose it so I ended up having to get my family involved to help me because I was starting to totally lose touch with reality from the panic and barely sleeping.

I honestly didn't get a decent night sleep until I found this forum and started taking Valerian and melatonin. I did try weed and kava in the beginning but they both induced panic for me. So if you're reading this and you've had that happen, you're not alone.

The heavy physical withdrawals lasted for a few days, but I still felt like hot garbage for a week or more. I spent 21 days sleeping on a mattress on my mom's floor in my hometown. I barely got anything done. But I was able to sleep and I wasn't alone. It took me 21 days to get a psych eval.

All of the mental issues that I went through with withdrawal was really difficult for me to convey and every time I reached out to a crisis line about help, I was totally losing my mind, but I spoke so calmly and rationally that they would kind of tell me not to come check into treatment. It was weird.

Anyway, I started new meds and things are going okay. I'm back on my own in my apartment. At first, I felt like I couldn't relate with myself or any of my things. Like I knew who I was and that these were my things, but it all made me uncomfortable. I'm finally coming around to it.

At Day 35, I would not say things are normal for me. Far from it. Sometimes I think I've misplaced my inner monologue in there somewhere, but I honestly can't be certain.

I've been having trouble lately where I can't sleep more than an hour without waking up and about the second time I do wake up, my neck and the backs of my knees are covered in sweat.

Last night, I had experiences like I just mentioned with waking up, but I ended up kind of having some panic set in and I was stuck in this waking daze for about 2 hours before I fell back to sleep. Could be PAWs, but unfortunately for me, some side effects of new meds are the same side effects of PAWs. So I'm just going to have to roll with it.

I feel like I am on the cusp of getting back to real life. It is trying to burst though. I feel my personality returning and yearning to have intelligent conversation and to bike and to paint and to read and to laugh so hard.

I am just so thankful for my family for helping me through this. I am immensely thankful for this forum and for everyone who had shared. Were it not for y'all I think I would have ended up in a very very dark place; darker than the place I found myself.

I will NEVER drink the sludge again. I've placed it into my mind as the same place that I hold alcohol and narcotics. That place is the total commitment to abstaining despite whatever comes my way. As I've forgotten the substances of my past, I will one day forget kratom.

If you're thinking about quitting, do it. I am here for you. We are all here for each other. Stay strong. Stay safe.

Edit: L-Theanine and GABA gummies and Ashwagandha, Passionflower, and Lemon balm tinctures were really good for helping me get through the waking days the first few weeks. ",13,3

I have dropped kratom since Nov 3rd of last year and have not gone back.
I'm really struggling still.  
I have become more emotional and my angry side has started manifesting.  Also paranoia, anxiety, extremely low energy and stomach issues, as well as constant headaches and a weird feeling in my head.

I have used kratom for a crutch for a long time, and it's shocking to have long suppressed issues to deal with.  Not surprising but the mental toll of accepting responsibility and figuring out how to have any ""me"" time to deal with it is the hardest part.

I just started a new job at a local pharmacy and it just beat the shit out of me.  I think it is literally making me sick.
I had no idea I'd be having to work 10-12 hr days out of the gate, and I haven't really been eating much or sleeping well.
I don't mind to pull extra work but my position is new and though they mean well, the communication is not great.

I'm a 35 yr old male who just moved back in with the parents.  I am pretty ashamed of myself; they know all about my issues with kratom.  I threatened suicide back on my 2nd day CT quit.  I've got debt problems and student loans that have me on edge all the time.  
All that said, I can still see a light I didn't while I was using.  Quitting has been one of the best decisions of my life.

I feel like a broken record, it‚Äôs groundhogs day again, I‚Äôm always wanting to go to and stay in bed, and yet never getting sleep or feeling rested.

This body ‚Äúcrush‚Äù I‚Äôm dealing with is unrelenting.

I decided about two weeks ago that it was time to divorce this shit and opted for a long taper, but have found myself pushing much harder to get down to the bottom of this as I‚Äôve become somewhat obsessed with seeing how much pain I can deal with and how little I can get by with. I‚Äôve dropped down to virtually nothing. Throwing nothing but a dash of the green mistress down the hatch just to make myself feel like I‚Äôm doing something.

It gets me to the gym, and that‚Äôs about it, as I drag myself through the motions.

I want to thank you people in this forum. I guess you could say something sparked finally when I first posted here and seeing everybody. I‚Äôve been tossing and washing my life away for about four years now I guess. Yet everything Kratom gave to me in the beginning it has completely robbed me of today. 

I used to feel social, Motivated, ambitious...it even took my existentialism away and made me feel reconnected and love even.

Now I feel like removing myself, hiding, covering myself over in shame and running from everything, if I could somehow will myself to drag this empty meat suit somewhere far away from everyone.

But this is temporary, and I am taking myself back god damn it! Fuck this shit!!! I am too far into the fire to go back to it again. This is the closest I‚Äôve been. Fuck you kratom. Get your snaggle-toothed  venom filled fangs and barbed claws out of me!!!

And a few other things if you want to read a short story.,"I know I‚Äôm not done yet. I am still tapering and I feel like a dumpster fire on a hot summer day pretty much everyday this week, but when I woke up this morning, my pupils were a NORMAL SIZE. I haven‚Äôt seen them like that in 9 years. I‚Äôm still at 24.5gpd, (from 80-100gpd) so my body is pretty pissed right now, but she‚Äôs fighting. She‚Äôs giving me little signs that this is working. Some people will say ‚Äúbut you‚Äôre not sober yet‚Äù blah blah blah. Yes Karen. I know, but for the first time in my life I‚Äôm doing this and sticking to it so please shut up and let me revel in my large pupils for a moment. And I‚Äôm sneezing. I can sneeze? Holy shit. 

I still wake up with my heart racing, skin crawling quite a bit and being unable to do much of anything all day, but I‚Äôm also not writhing in unbearable pain from CT. This definitely sucks, but I‚Äôm doing it. I keep thinking about jumping because I barely get any relief right now, but I don‚Äôt want to fail, so a slow burn suffering it is. I never succeeded at CT with anything. 

The emotional shit: Anyone a Vampire Diaries/The Originals fans? The one episode in The Originals where Vincent and Marcell give Elijah back his memories and he realizes he‚Äôs responsible for Hayley‚Äôs death. That scene where he screams and cries because he‚Äôs been overloaded? That‚Äôs what waking up from this shit feels like. It‚Äôs a flood of emotion. I almost threw up in the shower yesterday after a huge breakdown. I couldn‚Äôt catch my breath. All the pain I was pushing down with kratom came up with a vengeance. I hate feeling all that pain, but another first came up: I‚Äôm going to use it to grow instead of letting it hold me back. I‚Äôm going to share my story in some way or form and I pray to God it helps someone else from going down the road I did. I‚Äôve always been so ashamed of my story and I‚Äôm trying to muster up the courage to share it. 

They say all addicts have trauma. I don‚Äôt know if ‚Äúall‚Äù is appropriate, but it proves true for me. I‚Äôve endured so much and I‚Äôll be damned if I‚Äôm going to let that pain own me anymore. It‚Äôs over. It‚Äôs in the past, and that isn‚Äôt my life anymore. I don‚Äôt have to keep reliving it in everything I do and every person I meet. I do however, have to heal it. 

I have a lot of fears. I‚Äôm afraid my brain won‚Äôt heal. I had 2 back surgeries very young (15 & 16 years old). In that time frame, they pumped me full of Dilaudid at first like any surgery, then Vicodin, Valium, Flexiril and Motrin every 4-6 hours for 2.5 years. I was almost 18 and going through withdrawal, depression and all kinds of other shit and had no idea what was wrong with me. Back then, there was no ‚Äúopioid epidemic‚Äù. They handed them out like candy. I had no idea I was physically dependent on them at 15 years old. Mom and doctors were to be trusted and that‚Äôs all I knew. I remember being at the movies with a friend and I had the worst lockjaw. I was shaking and I thought I had epilepsy. (My mom was always trying to diagnose me with some weird shit so anytime I had a simple headache she would take me to the doctor to get an MRI because it HAD to be something insane that required boatloads of medication, and not just a fucking headache.) My mom thought I had depression, sent me to counseling, put me on a range of birth control methods because it had to be ‚Äújust teenage hormones‚Äù. The birth control made me go insane. Pretty sure she‚Äôs a hypochondriac and she has Munchausen Syndrome by proxy, but that‚Äôs another novel. 

I was never into drugs as a teenager. Had a stint for all of 5 months where I smoked week and drank, but I didn‚Äôt like it and got away from those friends. Then I injured my back from dance and had those surgeries. I‚Äôm now 38. I quit opiates 9 years ago only to start kratom. Kratom was touted as a ‚Äúnatural supplement‚Äù and I took the bait. Here I am fighting this demon again. 

When I tried to be normal at 18/19 years old, I felt horrible (shocker, right?). I was always tired, depressed and anxious. I could barely hold a job. Switched jobs all the time and I was never content and always restless. My body hurt all the time and everything felt like it took an extenuating amount of effort. After I had given birth to my 2 girls, of course they give you pain meds. My back hurt all the time and the opioid crisis still wasn‚Äôt in full effect, so I went to the doc and told him about my chronic back pain. I was 23 at the time. I knew then I was an addict. I ended up divorcing my addict husband, went to school, became an RN and held a job for 8 years all while on Vicodin everyday as a single mom of 2. I paid my bills. I had my own house and car.  I had over a 4.0 in college. I ‚Äòneeded‚Äô those pain meds to function, and the doctors were all for it. That ended when I took time off work claiming it was due to my other illness so I could quit, and used my short term disability benefits. I never went back to work and I‚Äôve been a stay at home mom on SSDI disability ever since, because my Ehler‚Äôs Danlos is the real problem. We are such good liars, us addicts. 

When I was on Vicodin I could concentrate. I was calm. I could laugh and be silly. I was a super mom. A workhorse. My house looked perfect all the time and I made astounding meals for my family. I got up and looked great for work everyday. I went to church twice a week, taught children‚Äôs Sunday school, and was an active, positive member of society. I threw lavish parties. I didn‚Äôt skip a beat...until it all came crashing down. One pill was too many, and a thousand wasn‚Äôt enough. 

The kratom did the same for a long time-until it didn‚Äôt. My biggest fear is that I can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt be productive, happy and able to do anything. That I‚Äôll be depressed, anxious, and unmotivated and unable to get out of bed like I was for so long. I‚Äôm afraid my brain will never recover. I feel like I‚Äôm such a weak person underneath it all. 

Today I‚Äôm grateful for normal pupils and sneezes and I‚Äôm praying my poor brain can break through to the other side after 23 years of abuse. 23 fucking years. God help me.

So I have hypothyroidism controlled with one pill per day.  When taking that pill my levels are generally normal and I am not in hypothyroid state.

The last two years, I happened to be on Kratom when I had my TSH test which indicates thyroid function. Once on Feb 2020 and this year Feb 21.  (I should state, I'd been off Kratom 8 days when I had this years test)

My TSH levels were high both times I had measured while on Kratom, (over 20) which indicates in state of hypothyroidism.  I was taking my pill, but often around same time as morning dose Kratom.

So now I've quit Kratom, 11 days CT.  I'll go back in for TSH retest in about month.

Just so interesting how body can be effected. It may be coincidental of course.

When that ran out I took some Gabapentin. Totally eliminated cravings and physical side effects. Barely thought about Kratom. Took about 600mg of Gabapentin 3 times a day, and bingo your out of the woods.

I have used Kratom for about 3 years. I heard about in a news article a few months off of another opiate like drug. It sounded great and didn't sound like it was addictive

Started with powder and got an ulcer within a few weeks so stopped for a month then switched to capsules. Was taking 30 grams a day at one point. The past 6 months more like 12ish. Didnt view it as a problem for a long time but now there are so many negatives i cant pretend

The last week i have been at 8 grams so i have cut down. I dose once an hour usually between noon and 10pm. 

I know i need to start cutting down more now and just posting in here for accountability and support

My doctor prescribed me clonidine, ibuprofen and things for nausea and diarrhea. She offered me suboxone or benzos but i told her no way and dont offer them again. Not trading one addiction for another again!

Im really looking forward to having a truly substance free life. Have struggled with addiction for 22 years. I dont want to go through my day always focused on using and secrecy. Dreading paws but know if i want a truly free life have to push through. The last 4 years I have quit smoking, lost 120 pounds, quit cutting, and over come homelessness so I know I can do this im just scared because I have ptsd and have never had to face the trauma without some level of numbness.

I also have Seroquel, Klonopin, and THC pens to help if it should become a problem. 

The symptoms that have been most bothersome so far are:

1) runny nose and sneezing 
2) a cough and gag reflex, though it may be from vaping (didn‚Äôt use to happen though)
3) body temperature fluctuations (expected) 
4) fatigue and vertigo 

I know the next couple days are crucial to remain steadfast, and I honestly don‚Äôt foresee myself slipping in this first week. It‚Äôs after 2-3 weeks I worry about, because that‚Äôs when it seems the prolonged anhedonia starts getting to people and the PAWS and psychological part of the journey take shape. 

I think it‚Äôll make a difference for me that last time, when I went 17 days three years ago before turning to kratom, I didn‚Äôt have a job. I sat in my room most of the time. This time, I‚Äôm a front line worker and I have no choice but to be on my feet.

But my gut feeling is that this is just the way becoming sober is, we have these dark existential thoughts thinking like ""how can I live my life without this drug"" but eventually these thoughts get kind of old, and once we think about them once (or in my case 20 or 30 times) when I go back to the dark place (less frequently than I used to: PROGRESS), I'm running out of dark thoughts to jump too if that makes sense lol.

Dead tired and not motivated to even move off the couch, but I jumped on the bicycle and go for a ride :) Lots and lots of water, and it does seem like this taper drop is going better than the last one, grateful for that too.

Less energy, moving a bit slower... very low mood and a craving for K when I had a brief moment to think. Taking multiple OTC painkillers for the enhanced WD body aches that still persist. No other physical WD symptom to mention aside from mild fatigue at this point! Day 5 most of the physical symptoms stopped.

After eating a large and healthy lunch at 12:30, downing a body armor, black tea and gatorade for electrolytes.... it was more than tolerable. My energy picked up and I literally forgot what it was like to work sober without a crutch to give me ""energy"" or ""motivation"" Before I knew it the day was over. I walked out to my car exhausted and in more pain than usual, but proud I made it.

I was driving home from work with the intention of stopping before picking up my kid from school, but then I just didn‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt do it anymore. 

I have been taking Kratom for a solid year now and take about 50-60g a day. At first, it was the best. It made me motivated, happy, calm. A year later, it makes me anxious when I don‚Äôt have it and so so moody. Most of all, it doesn‚Äôt make me high. Actually, it hasn‚Äôt for a long time. I‚Äôm literally still taking it because I‚Äôm afraid of withdrawal and the possible lingering depression after initial withdrawal. Or maybe that‚Äôs the addiction in me, convincing me to spend my last twenty bucks on K.. 

I was an IV heroine user a few years ago and kicked it cold turkey. However, that addiction only lasted 6 months maybe? I quit by moving out of the city I lived in and in with my parents for about a year.  I was sober about a year and a half before starting Kratom. 

My husband has no clue I take Kratom, much less that I am deeply addicted. I want to tell him, but I‚Äôm too scared of losing his trust. Because he doesn‚Äôt know, I feel like I don‚Äôt have anyone to hold me accountable. We have been fighting really badly the last few weeks and I swear it‚Äôs mood swings from Kratom. 

I have one friend that knows how addicted I am.  However, she‚Äôs the friend I started taking Kratom with and she has no intentions on stopping.. she also takes prob only 10g a day? I just needed to write this down and put it out there because I feel like I have no one. I know it‚Äôs a mental game and I can do this.

Just remember the pain is the healing.,"I'm on day 2 of withdrawal from a ton of those nasty kratom extracts. But, my story goes back much further. I spent about 15 years on hydros, oxys, and then fentanyl. Fent withdrawals I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. Except Gary! Screw Gary.

Anyway, I cold turkey'd the fent by some miracle. After about 10 days I stupidly started taking kratom to deal with the PAWS stuff. Here I am one month later and just two days ago I was taking like 6 - 8 concentrated shots a day. I refuse to go back. It wasn't even a pleasant feeling. I was anxious most of the time. Woke up anxious. Spent a ton on kratom shots. So, a month was enough. If I can kick fent I can kick kratom.

It's day 2. I ran 3 excruciating miles. I worked out for an hour too. It was awful. I just want to be free and I'm willing to go to the ends of the earth to get it. I have to remind myself when everything hurts that it is good. It's my abused body reaching out for equilibrium. It helps that I am a bit of a masochist.

This is my first post here (though I've been lurking awhile). I quit kratom about 7 years ago, though I got hooked again after being clean for 4 years. This time I was taking about 10 - 20 gpd. I've had short stints of abstinence since starting again, but never got past a week.

Well, I'm done with kratom. I can't believe I got addicted again... My mental health is rapidly deteriorating (and i suspect my physical health as well). I'm laid off right now, and have nothing to keep me stable. This is a good time to get clean (and a terrible time to stay in my addiction).

Reasons why I'm quitting:
- It makes me feel worn-out after the short high.
- Regular redosing 
- Spilling it or not having enough makes me panic
- Random mood swings
- Tastes like üí©
- Poor concentration / memory
- ill-timed sleepiness or insomnia (if I don't dose at correct time)
- General fiend-iness 
- Occasional nausea / stomach discomfort
- Very low motivation

I'm taking my last dose tonight, and dumping the remainder. I already exercise regularly, but tomorrow I'm gonna do a little extra (maybe walk a couple miles on top of my usual workout) so that I'll sleep better. I have green tea on hand for the daytime, magnesium and melatonin for the evenings.

I'm gonna keep checking in as I go through this. Everyone who's shared their experience so far... you are awesome. I probably wouldn't be brave enough to start if I didn't know everyone else was doing it too.",9,0

Each time, I took great comfort in reading posts from this group.  I'm hoping that actually participating will help this time.  I started using Kratom a long time ago, and loved the boost of energy it gave me.  I suppose I don't have much of a different story than most people here (which is why these posts are so comforting to read right now.).  I have a high stress job, and three little ones.  Kratom made me feel motivated and energized to do all those things so well and be in a great mood.  

As with most people, the dosage kept increasing to the point where the negative side effects of Kratom began to outweigh the positives, which were simultaneously decreasing.  The process happens so slowly, you don't realize you're now taking something just to feel normal, and having to deal with no sleep and horrible agitation.  I would say things to people I would never dream of saying when I wasn't taking Kratom.  I get frustrated with my kids too easily, even when the Kratom is fully working.  I kept telling myself that I needed to start to taper and get off this stuff.  I was hiding it from my wife and it just wasn't sustainable.  I knew deep down that nothing was better than nothing.  In other words, I was never happier than when I was just taking nothing.  It was so nice to have natural motivation to do things and know that my entire schedule didn't need to revolve around Kratom.  

I finally broke down to my wife and asked her to hold me accountable.  We have full disclosure and I have no way of buying this stuff without her knowing now.  I told her all my tricks and asked her to be on the lookout for them.  She keeps some capsules we purchased in a safe that only she knows the code for and gives me my daily ration each night (about 16 pills, or 8 grams).  I don't know what I'd do without her.  I feel for people who don't have this accountability.  I feel very dull right now, cutting down to 8 grams (I was probably taking 12-15 per day before this drop.).  I'm hoping that this will be the hardest part since it should be my biggest drop, but I need to be prepared.  

There's always that temptation that I can just go get some now, and it will be great!  And the truth is, it will be great.  But it leads down a road we all know too well.  Until then, I keep the thought, *nothing is better than nothing.*",12,0

My last dose was maybe a teaspoon in the early afternoon on Jan 27th. As of today is has officially been two weeks, and I gotta say, I really did not think I was going to make it. My experience with withdrawals has been mostly anxiety, horrible anxiety, and some back pain. It's pretty wild to see how far I've come in only two weeks though. Feels like months. Upped my Sertraline dose right as I was quitting which I think looking back was a mistake. I think the anxiety which came flooding in from quitting K, in addition to the anxiety from more serotonin in my brain from Zoloft kinda broke me. Almost wound up in the hospital for self harm because the anxiety was so bad. 

I've always struggled with anxiety but I guess the K had *really* been masking things for a while. Used almost daily for around eight months. Anyways, things have gotten a lot better since then. The Zoloft is starting to settle, the anxiety is definitely still high but much better, manageable, and getting better each day. The back pain, too, has faded a lot. I experienced this pain for maybe eight months and was really scared that I would be dealing with it for the rest of my leaf. Then I stopped Kratom, and my pain is going away. Funny how something that's supposed to ease pain (really just shutting down your perception of it instead of actually dealing with the root cause) can actually cause much more of it than it kills. 

The cravings are still really intense, which kind of surprises me and makes me fear for my future. I know both my parents have struggled with addition in the past, though they both dealt with it successfully. The problem is that the small town where I live has a sort of cafe type deal which begun selling K in 2016 and \*surprise\* it's not their best seller and what most folks come in for. Terrible to see so many young people like myself hanging in there all day every day, no masks, just falling deeper and deeper into the hole. I feel now that the shopkeep is personally responsible for harming our community, and it blows my effings mind that this stuff has somehow avoided scheduling on multiple ocassions. Who knows, maybe the FDA just schedules things in an intentionally irrational manner in order to screw with people.

Alright, rant over. Good luck y'all. You quit and every day for the rest of your life (consciously or unconsciously) is a choice to use or not to use. I'm always happy to speak with people about their experiences and commiserate in our suffering. Peace.",5,2

I've gotten off before for two weeks out of 3 years. I was a heavy user; typically upwards of 40+ gpd. I tapered like hell, used unsaid nootropic, pot, and finally made it.

Last time, I was euphoric. I was ready and willing for life again. I'm not saying that that isn't the case now, because it somewhat is. I'm having the hardest time focusing, I'm sleepy as shit, no motivation. I'm somewhat disappointed, hahahHave you guys been able to use anything to perk up? I don't want script drugs, and I'm too much of an anxious person to take most stimulants. Khanna has always given me the absolute worst headaches- microdosing or not. So. That's going to be a no go. I've had ginseng, but same thing, just less severe.I used to be able to get modafinil, but can't risk the purchasing ways anymore.

Idk if this matters, but I'm a 24F and I only weigh about 100lbs, and don't eat a whole lot (f\*ckin clearly lmao) so anything that requires a meal is a bit of a struggle, but still willing to try.

Any help/ideas/advice would be helpful, even if unrelated to drugs/ supplements.

You‚Äôre safer without it folks. As a vet in this battle I want to share my greatest techniques that have help me overcome the addiction and withdrawals. 
1. Sleep as much as you can, I know it‚Äôs hard. Rotate between melatonin and valerian root try not to develop dependency to either.
2. Exercise. Whether it be dragging your ass to the park to shoot basketball hoops even if you are terrible, or speed walking, weightlifting, bike riding, anything that gets your heart rate up will give you the endorphins to help you relax once you get home. This helps so much with the restlessness and making a sport of it gets your mind off of the addiction and withdrawals.
3. Cold showers. I‚Äôm dead serious. Start your day with a cold shower. This is a mental exercise that GROWS your mind‚Äôs self discipline to overcome the addiction and withdrawals. It also helps you shake your morning depression because it makes you feel so miserable in that moment that everything is better in comparison. I could go on, but I want each of you to follow the page coldshowers on here and digest the information available on there.

Through these practices I have helped regain some level of mental independence from kratom. It is all in our heads, but that doesn‚Äôt make it any less real when you suffer from it. These methods WILL help you. If you are not actively practicing these methods each day then you are not being proactive in this battle, which can lead to relapse which is worse than withdrawal all around. 

Part of the reason I am sharing this with you is because I want to hear feedback from you all, I need help with the last thing nagging me at this. The cravings. I feel it take over my mind when they set in, I begin feeding it caffeine but it has no effect on the desire for that greater stimulation. Exercise is the best thing I have found to battle this, but other times I want to have a night for leisure minus the cravings. Have any of you found a remedy for this? I‚Äôm sure even smoking a joint would help a lot for this, but my job is very anti weed and I am randomly drug tested very often with a doctor to watch me pee so a joint is out of the question. What solutions can you all offer me for a stimulating, relaxing remedy?",11,0

I am planning on doing 2.5g 4 times per day and then tapering down by 0.25 per dose until I am done completely.

I have been going on various lengths of quitting streaks almost weekly ever since and even made it 20 days one time. 

Don't be me. Looking back on all of those times I tried and just didn't have the willpower to stick it out is pretty depressing. Even if I had stuck with my most recent attempt I could at least be almost 20 days in. But instead I've only taken two days off in the last two weeks. That's got to be the most I've ever taken in four months. 

I definitely payed for it too. I became really depressed and felt myself getting more physically and psychologically dependent on it. That's when I realized that I had to do everything I could to not be in this position a year from now like I am from when I first tried to quit almost a year ago to today. 

I was genuinely terrified of being stuck always trying to quit and never making it past a few days. Something told me it was right now or never. I think if I stick to this one I could forgive myself for all those times I've caved and the wasted days being in withdrawals not fully enjoying life to it's potential.

Update:

Three heaping teaspoons in a liter of hot water, mixed with lemon juice, all good.  I do this twice a day - once in the morning, another around 2pm or so.  Gives me a good amount of energy to get through the day, and side effects I've noticed are having a generally bloated/gassy feeling, burping, having to urinate frequently, and recently a significant lack of libido.  I also noticed that if I had too much kratom, I would get some muscle tension in my upper back and had to force myself to focus on relaxing my shoulders as I'd be holding them tense a lot.


Decided to taper off as I want my libido back and am sick of feeling bloated/gassy recently.. been burping a lot which is annoying.. and realizing I should probably take a tolerance break as well.  Last week I went from having my usual two jugs of kratom tea (with 3 heaping tsp each), to two flat tsp of kratom, and only having one and a half jugs of tea a day.. so I've effectively cut my dose down by just over half the usual amount.  Today is day 4 of the reduced amount.


Over the last couple days I've had pain all through my middle to upper back.  Its a deep, burning pain that almost feels like my organs are inflamed.  Its worse in the mornings after I get out of bed, or when sitting for a while.  When I get up and walk around, or stretch a bit, it subsides.  Also seems to subside if I let out gas.  It seems to move around my back and doesn't stay in one particular area - sometimes the pain is more toward the middle of my back, other times it seems to move to my sides, or up my back a bit.  Other than this I just notice I have a little bit less energy, which is expected as I was primarily using Kratom to increase my energy level.  No other obvious symptoms at all.  I also quit drinking alcohol last week (would have a few drinks a night, but stopped last week as I tend to get acid reflux flare ups sometimes).


Is this burning/aching back pain typical when tapering off of Kratom?  I know it would probably be best to go to the doctor, but with the whole covid thing going around I'd rather avoid going to the doctors office for now.. and if it doesn't subside soon, I will make an appt.  A quick search on this group shows some others with mention of burning/back pain, just looking for some reassurance here I suppose...  I do plan to keep tapering down, perhaps go down to just one jug of tea a day starting today for a few days, then half that, then quit completely.

I use to tell myself the world is a savage place and addicts are those that unconsciously remember a world that is more gentle, uplifting, one that trembles with beauty.   Part of me still thinks that way but I now know its an excuse; and what we lose is a sense of purpose, that motivating force that propels us to live fully.  Drugs turns us to zombies, as hurtful to ourselves and others as the walking dead.  To create a life where I *want* to be sober is to experience the present; our bodies are our best hope to rescue us from roles (son/mother/employee/artist/hunter etc) so we can be who we really are.  And that is the only way for peace and contentment.  To experience joy is to live in the moment.  Commit to living with your *true self*  and your daily life becomes a transformational process

I don't know how to practice what I preach, but I have a feeling if you make an effort, youre there already

So Kratoms got to go.  Im so scared but moving forward.  The extracts pulled me to a lost  numbness that is paralyzing so Im coming off those today

If you read this cool and thank you - it helps to not feel alone. I'm mostly just going to rant, but I feel I need to get it out of my head in order to maybe start the healing process. I feel so icky inside and need it all out. 

I've been in and out of this thread for a while. I broke my 30gpd habit last year during the first quarantine and ever since I am a every couple day 2-5 day binger of about 5-10grams.. this has been going on forever, and I told myself to bite the bullet a couple weeks ago and give myself at least 2 weeks to see how I feel......I ended up getting gabapentin and clonidine from my doc because my RLS kills me, but now, instead of using them to stop the kratom, instead of being sober on my off kratom days, I just take the gabapentin and look forward to the next day I can take kratom again. I can't fn fight and break this mental addiction. I feel so uncomfortable in my own skin when I don't take kratom, but now I've only added more to my daily arsenol with the gabapentin (which I don't even like and doesn't really help my RLS but i just take it bc the demons say so)... My natural brain chemistry so so far gone.. I'll cry for no reason, then have a spurt of natural joy and then immediately feel depressed and flatlined and hopeless and get like butterflies thinking about the comfort of kratom always being there for me. I'm so fn miserable and upset with mind and my soul is dying to be free of this pattern..... 

I know it's up to me, I'm not trying to write a boohoo story or woah is me, but maybe if I get this out of my head and know other people are reading it, it will help me realize that no one can help me but myself.. I need a game plan.. I need to be a balanced mommy for my daughter and boyfriend (who is also an addict and we do everything together - he is ok with quitting though but it's kinda like I need to lead the way and he follows).

Well, if you made it to this part of this rant, thank you for being here with me and reading what's in my mind as I sit here at my desk looking out the little slit of a window wishing I could just be happy to be breathing. <3 Much love to anyone fighting another day today.",22,1

Don't know what to do? HAVE YOU TRIED THIS?,"I quit 235 days ago after tapering from 20-30gpd for 7 weeks after a 3+ year daily habit. Doing well. NEVER want to use kratom EVER again. Insomnia *was* my biggest WD symptom / hurdle with quitting and staying quit.

If you're new or always use Reddit mobile or just haven't done so yet, I strongly suggest going on the web version long enough to read ALL the sidebar info on this sub. It's EXTREMELY helpful and can answer a lot of questions you may have, build your confidence in quitting, and perhaps make  WDs more manageable. Here are 3 archived posts that were / are most important to me quitting and staying quit (YMMV):

[READ THIS FIRST if you're new...](https://old.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/7p0qx2/read_this_first_if_youre_new/) - This one is so important that it's not only on the sidebar but also a stickied post when sorting by ""hot"". This sub's Taper Guide is in there... What to expect when quitting... Info on PAWS... Supplement / helper meds info, etc. etc. So much helpful info that should not be overlooked. Hell, a simple tutorial for changing your flair to display your quit date is the first thing listed. This one post is literally a how-to guide in getting started to quit kratom.

Speaking of the [Taper Guide](https://old.reddit.com/r/modquittingkratom/comments/63tjtd/tapering/), read it! Obviously everyone is different and you'll have some questions along the way, but this guide should give you a good foundation if you decide to taper instead of quitting CT (cold turkey).

[The Wim Hof Method...](https://old.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/7si4ui/the_wim_hof_methodan_awesome_little_set_of/) - I didn't start doing these amazing breathing exercises until a week into my quit. I wish I'd started sooner... even during my taper. The breathing and cold showers were (are) a lifesaver for me. I still do them. It's a healthy daily habit / routine.

Lastly, I want to mention and recommend this sub's **Daily Check-In Thread** - Not on the sidebar, but it's a daily changing stickied post that can be found by sorting by ""hot"", just like the ""Read This First"" guide mentioned above. You can simply just write what day you're on or you can go into detail about how you're doing with your quit. Whatever. I've been checking-in since the beginning of my quit and still continue to do so. It's become a healthy daily habit for me. What I find most important though, is that it can provide ACCOUNTABILITY and you can also get to meet regulars from this sub. We all know how important support is when quitting. I found / continue to find an abundance of support in the Daily Check-In Thread. A new one is posted at the same time daily. If you've been staying quit for some time, it's a great way to help new quitters and to pass on experience, knowledge, hope and support.

These are just a FEW helpful tools for quitting from this sub Reddit in addition to the posts and comments in the feed. Why not take advantage of everything here to help us quit and stay quit? Whether you're new, been quit for months or years or in between, let's take advantage of all the amazing resources offered here. Quit and STAY QUIT, my friends.",57,0

Hi! I‚Äôve been a regular Kratom user for 4 years. 
After I noticed my physical health seemed to start deteriorating I decided to start my journey to quitting, and I‚Äôve been tapering for about 2 weeks now, so I‚Äôm still quite early into the process. I‚Äôm a 22 year old female, and although I‚Äôm still quite early in the process, have never experienced something like this before and don‚Äôt really know what to expect. 
I‚Äôve already experienced some withdrawal symptoms, but other than that the process has (luckily) been quite easy and exhilarating for me. 
The one thing that‚Äôs throwing me off however is extreme aching of the breasts that‚Äôs continued for about a week now. I apologize if that‚Äôs TMI, but I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has had this experience as well. I‚Äôm not sure if withdrawals can be different based on anatomy, and there‚Äôs not really any information about it online. 
Aside from that, I‚Äôd be interested to hear of any ‚Äúuncommon‚Äù withdrawal symptoms people have experienced!",4,0

Sorry if this is all over the place and ramble-y.
I‚Äôm struggling with depression, adhd, anxiety, cptsd, and borderline personality disorder. I got out of a year long, pretty unhealthy relationship this past week, and I also got a new job that I start Sunday. So a lot going on. My depression has been really bad this past week, and I‚Äôve been extremely lonely.. like I feel so bad that Kratom doesn‚Äôt even help, it‚Äôs really just the action of dosing that relieved my anxiety for a little while. That being said, I am trying a bit of a tough love tactic with myself, without descending into a state of utter self-loathing. It‚Äôs a very fine line for me. I managed to take my dog on a pretty long walks yesterday and today, which is big for me since I stopped exercising after my car accident this time last year. I also put away two loads of laundry (first time in weeks) AND made my first appointment with a new therapist for the 20th. I also paid my copay for medical marijuana appointment on Wednesday, which required answering the phone - something I‚Äôve been desperately avoiding. I‚Äôm definitely taking less kratom, but I just want to stop completely so bad! It isn‚Äôt even making me feeling better! I can only talk about it with one person, so the isolation makes it that much easier to keep going. It‚Äôs causing so much self-loathing, and I fucking know better. I ordered four different suggested supplements that I started taking yesterday and they‚Äôre actually helping, I think. I also talked on the phone to the guy I like and set up a date for tomorrow!  as the title said, I‚Äôm tapering off extracts. I‚Äôve done it many times before, and had very few withdrawal symptoms most of the time. This time is difficult I think because of all the changes. I know it will never be a ‚Äúgood‚Äù time, and I‚Äôm so close to the end...I need to see if there‚Äôs any meetings in my area. COVID makes this that much harder.

After I quit, it flew up to 16,  18, 20, 24_, ... ???

It was like I couldn't feel my doses anymore. I just felt spinny and loopy. No nice euphoria no pain relief, no mood boost. All the benefits of kratom, gone. So basically I thought it would be easy to quit. So I went without on a Sunday and began to feel bad opioid withdrawal creep in. Tried to buy more at a local vendor but found them closed on Sundays so I had to endure until Monday as symptoms got progressively worse.

So I figured then CT was not for me. I would taper.

But I can't find my base dose anymore. 

I can't believe it would go past 20-24g so fast. And I don't feel any benefits, just my head spins.

I haven't enjoyed music except in small glimpses until this morning so that's a good sign. Usually by day four or five I'm playing my guitar and singing non-stop. We'll see.

I bought some coffee at a drive through espresso shop this morning. When the redhead-tomboy barista asked if I wanted cream I almost fainted. Starting to get that caveman feeling. I wanted to do things to her that would make you slap your grandma.

I've definitely had some minor depression over the last 2 weeks specifically, but it's hard to tell if it's related to my recent divorce and/or exacerbated by PAWS.

The single best thing I've done while quitting is exercise. I really let my health slip the 4ish years I was using kratom, and I was always in great shape. It's been very, very rewarding seeing my appearance and fitness improve.  Also, the act of disciplining myself to exercise, especially when I don't want to, leads to discipline in other areas of my life as well.

I doubt I'll ever go back to kratom. I loved having a strong red tea with lots of lime juice at night, but I have such awful self control that it will ALWAYS spiral out of control.  I simply don't need it.

I enjoy waking up feeling like death. It means healing and I'm a bit of a masochist. I see this as punishment for terrible decisions. Kratom is certainly better than the fent I was snorting. But I want to heal completely. A month of kratom is enough. I don't know how much of this is kratom withdrawals vs. fent withdrawals.

Today was the first day I had to deal with a mental craving though. I did a lot of chores yesterday, more than I‚Äôve done in months, so today I‚Äôm a little worn out. I was cuddling with my dog in bed watching Supernatural and suddenly it popped into my head: ‚ÄúI want some k‚Äù. We‚Äôve been pretty broke, so even if I wanted to relapse I couldn‚Äôt, but today I got an email from my state telling me my unemployment extension was finally approved and they‚Äôll be back paying what I should have gotten.

Trying My Best but Having Negative Thoughts,"This is actually not my first time quitting kratom, but it's my first time posting in this sub and I guess I feel like I just need to vent and get some reassurance lol. I've been reading inspirational stories on here for almost two years, basically ever since my kratom habit first became chronic. You guys are awesome and supportive as hell and have gotten me through some shitty times :)

I decided to quit kratom again earlier this week for multiple reasons, though the primary issue was that my hair started thinning considerably after I relapsed last March and became a daily user again. I'm also leaving my family's house and will be living with friends across the country, and I just don't want to bring my awkward, shameful addiction with me. Though call me superficial, the most important reason to quit for me is getting my hair back.

Starting last May or June, I noticed my hair thinning because the lady cutting my hair pointed it out, and I have no idea why that wasn't a wake-up call for me to quit again. It may have already been thinning before that point but I never noticed. That was 3 months after I got back on kratom. To say the least, it was devastating to my self-esteem since I've always had very thick and healthy hair before all this BS. I got bloodwork done and they didn't find anything wrong with me that would be causing hairloss (I'm a 21 year-old male and my family doesn't have a history of premature balding at all). I kept telling myself until about a month ago that I could grow my hair back without quitting kratom, but I knew deep down that was just self-destructive behavior due to my attachment to the drug. Despite knowing that my hair was falling out last May, I kept taking kratom for another 8 months and of course the hair loss hasn't stopped :\\

This time around hasn't been nearly as awful as the last time I quit a little over a year ago, since my habit had reached 30-50gpd back then. Now I'm quitting from a habit of around 15-20gpd so it's considerably easier, though the constant negative thoughts are worse than last time. My biggest issue during withdrawal right now is just staying positive. I guess my main question is: for anyone who experienced hair loss, how long were you taking kratom before it started happening? It really wasn't until about a year and a half after I started taking kratom daily and quit for a few months before using again that I noticed my hair loss. Does it still make sense that the kratom caused this? I assume it might be because my testosterone levels took a while to be affected.

I feel good about having not taken kratom in over 85 hours, but I'm anxious that my hair will never grow back. Bleh

Today is the first day that I would say I am feeling relatively normal. A bit sluggish, a bit tired from the annoying insomnia but otherwise not too bad at all. Last four days I  forced myself to go running for half an hour, which turned out to be incredibly painful for my legs but really good for my mind. Anhedonia seems to be disappearing, which is a huge relieve. 

Again, Loperamide has saved my ass. I was able to work and I could care for my two children because of this drug. A bit impaired but I don't think they noticed anything. Every morning I felt like total crap, as the loperamide from the previous day had left my system. I always took 5 capsules first thing in the morning and started to feel much much better two hours after taking the stuff. It is very slow to kick in but it does make a big difference. Turns nasty withdrawals into something on par with a bad cold.

For insomnia I drank half a bottle of gin every evening (not really recommended), which worked okayish as it induced a 4-5 hour comatose sleep. Better a few hours of coma than no sleep at all but certainly not healthy. I am a pretty heavy drinker so I don't get hangovers from half a bottle. Don't try this if you are not used to alcohol. I can testify that a hangover while in Kratom withdrawal is hellish. Will stop the hard booze next weekend as it is too harsh on my body.  

So far no real cravings, which is a good sign. This time I feel much more confident that I can leave Kratom behind me. Need to work on not becoming an alcoholic, which is probably worse than being a Kratom addict.",10,0

The memory, vision, and sex drive losses have been debilitating but I‚Äôve written them off as collateral damage.  That seems so crazy to me right now.

I‚Äôve tried tapering a few times.  Never stuck.  I told my psychiatrist a week or so ago in hopes she would freak out and help.  She couldn‚Äôt care less.  I‚Äôve always been a CT kinda guy, but figured I couldn‚Äôt accept the performance hit at work that Kratom wd would create.

This morning I read a post about memory loss and it made me focus on how bad it is and the huge negative impact it‚Äôs having on my life.  Then I posted about the horrible vision loss I‚Äôve experienced.  

Right now I feel like I have to just ct right now.  I don‚Äôt believe I will be able to successfully taper.  I have a too addictive mind.  So I‚Äôve decided to call my pcp and tell him the deal and ask for helper meds.  Then I‚Äôm going to tell my wife so she is prepared.

Despite all this, I‚Äôm really lacking confidence that I will actually do it.  I‚Äôve always been a guy that does what he says he‚Äôs gonna do.  This crap has me doubting myself like I‚Äôve never experienced outside of a bipolar episode.  Yeah, I‚Äôm bipolar too...that doesn‚Äôt help, but has been fine since I started Kratom.  I fear that the ct will put me back in the hell of an episode.  My plan is to just remind myself that it‚Äôs just Kratom wd.  But anyone who has had a manic/depressive (or worst, mixed) episode knows that logical thought sometimes is no help.

Anyway, I‚Äôm not sure what I hope to get out of this post.  Just felt I needed to share with someone and dread the thought of anyone who knows me see how weak I am.  I guess I‚Äôm also looking for encouragement and/or advice.  I guess I‚Äôm realizing that I need help.  Asking for encouragement and/or help is also something I didn‚Äôt think I would ever do.

The last few days I‚Äôve been having a hard time keeping my spirits up and was getting really down on myself for feeling so exhausted and heavy and those self loathing/deprecating thoughts started to sneak in when all of a sudden it hit me, ‚Äú im only 40 some odd days off K, and a little over 2 weeks clean from booze, why am I expecting to be as strong and confident and healed as god himself by now?

It really is a perfect support for those trying to taper and will also help me curb impulse spending like trips to coffee shop, dispensary, snacks, etc.

I think with these compulsions  blocked I can get better at budgeting n living off grocery trips and finding more constructive things to do that getting high on coffee/weed/kratom.

Kratom has some awful side effects for me even in low doses so I know I will be better off fully quitting.

I managed to get clean with the help of a doc about 3 years back but relapsed within ga year. I was put on gabapentin and baclofen by my doc and continued to use those along with opiates. I then started taking Kratom about 2 years ago in the hopes of helping me quit opiates. And though I did reduce my opiate use and sometimes even stopped, I got terribly hooked to Kratom. I won't get into what that entails because you already know. During the last year I have mostly used very small amounts of opiates (almost negligible) but a lot of Kratom.

I took the opportunity during the lockdowns to get clean. Just three months back I was in the midst of withdrawals feeling helpless and lost. I thought even if got through the acutes, the PAWS would leave me feeling depressed for years. But that was not how it played out. I got back to almost 90% in 2 months. There were 2 days in between when I used again just because I had access to it again. I left a post here and thanks to all the support I got I flushed in down the toilet. Best decision ever. I used a few supplements to help me through this. You can have a look at some of my previous posts to get an idea of what I used. I have also been off Gabapentin as well.

Life update: I have been feeling MUCH better and in fact I can get a lot more done now. I was fooling mys elf into thinking that Kratom was helping me. I have also been off THC/CBD for the last 25 or so days. I am also doing my best to quit caffein. I find that my productivity and sleep is much better without it. Quitting caffein has been a bit tricky though. Also, during the last two months I realised that I was spending ungodly amounts of time on my phone watching youtube vides (like 6+ hours a day) which is just ridiculous and lame unless someone is paying you to do that. I am working on that. I also had some trouble with PMO (just got that addictive gene trait I guess). Been working on that too. 

**My advice to anyone else going through acutes and PAWS**

The acutes will be over before you know it. The problem however seems insurmountable when you are going through them though. But trust me and virtually everyone else who has detoxed, it WILL be over. There is no other outcome here. PAWS and staying clean is the tricky part. I don't think I got noticeable PAWS (surprising since I have been on opiates for so long) and got lucky. I don't even think about Kratom or opiates anymore. The though might rarely come into my mind but I can very quickly acknowledge it and push it aside. You need to keep your goal on the long run. Once you're through the acutes, remind yourself of the horrid W/D you went through if you ever feel like using again. DO NOT KEEP A BACKUP STASH. Also, unless you are exercising, doing some mindfulness meditation and being remotely productive, working on a hobby etc. then maybe you should address those issues first before worrying about your PAWS. If you don't have the energy to work out then remind yourself of what  Joe Rogan said, if you can drag yourself to the fridge then you can drag yourself through a workout. I found Atomic Habits to be great book with practical advice on building habits. You can get the audiobook as well. Jacko Wilink's Psychological Warfare is also a great album to light a fire under your ass. And ofcourse, Goggins is up there too. Rich Roll is also another fantastic resource. I think this is critical for staying clean and sober. If you are just dragging your feet through work and spending your free time watching videos then you may feel depressed even without the PAWS.

Brace yourselves, this is my story, a very long post, and I have a lot to talk about, hoping for some advice. First time positing ever. I‚Äôve been snooping on this community the last month, receiving some motivation and inspiration to quit. I have been using kratom for 1-2 years. Dosage has increased slowly during that time. Started with 2 tablespoons and have recently been taking like 6-8 daily. When I first started taking kratom, it gave me more motivation and I enjoyed the opiate-like high, something I had really liked when on opiates in the past. I would take some at night, enjoy the high, and just fall asleep. However, I started taking it during the day for the last 6-8 months recently and I enjoyed the motivation it gave me and decreased social anxiety. After a while though it‚Äôs really changed who I am as a person. It has actually started to severely decrease my motivation after being a daily user for so long. Instead of doing art and working out and other activities that used to make me happy in my daily life, I have started to not do them at all and just sit home, read, and chill more. I miss painting and running. It has actually made me feel more depressed. 3-4 months ago one night when my boyfriend and I came back from the bar, we got into an argument (we usually know better than to argue while under the influence because for obvious reasons it really makes it worse lol) but this time I ended up completely breaking and I admitted to my kratom addiction. He had no idea what it was, but just took it all with him, thew it away, and told me to stop. I have never told anyone but him because I‚Äôm extremely shameful and embarrassed of my addition. I don‚Äôt normally think 23 yr old girls like me would be into this. I knew he was right, I needed to stop, but the next night I had one of the most terrible experiences I‚Äôve ever had. I couldn‚Äôt sleep or get comfortable the whole entire night. The withdrawals were so bad that I was pushing against the wall above my head on the bed as hard as I could, clenching my teeth and just in pure agony. Luckily my boyfriend wasn‚Äôt awake for any of this, he‚Äôs the heaviest sleeper in the world. I never ever want to go through that experience ever again. Seriously it was fucking terrible. The withdrawals were just insane for me so I relapsed the next day or so and have been taking it since. The one thing it has not affected is my passion for snowboarding. I am extremely good and passionate at snowboarding and I have been going at least once a week with friends, becoming better and doing new tricks. However, I had a snowboarding accident a couple weeks ago (1 month ago) in which I fell and fractured my wrist and partially tore a ligament. The doctor recommended I have surgery, so I just had the surgery this morning. (Side note: I took kratom only the night before my surgery, not at all today, because they‚Äôve been giving me copious amounts of painkillers). I did not tell the doctors about it, because I‚Äôve been reading about other people‚Äôs experiences on Reddit of them being ok and decided to risk it, stupidly. I am just so embarrassed I don‚Äôt want anyone else to know. Most people don‚Äôt know what it is. The kratom did not affect the anesthesia and I may not have noticed but I‚Äôm sure I needed higher doses of painkillers. I have been prescribed 45 5-325mg of Percocet and I just took 3 an hour or so ago. I took more than they told me because my tolerance is way up. Before I just took the 3, I was starting to experience the kratom withdrawals like 5 or more hours after my surgery. I‚Äôve noticed being on kratom for so long has increased my tolerance to opioids and the prescription opioids they have given me help with the withdrawals. I‚Äôm at a dead end because I need to fucking stop kratom. I know I do. I have just been so addicted to it and the withdrawals are scary and fucked. I‚Äôm afraid once I run out of these painkillers I‚Äôll just have to start taking kratom again. Do you guys think I‚Äôll still have withdraws even if I stop taking kratom altogether now while just sticking with the Percocet until it runs out? Or will I have just withdrawals from the Percocet? Idk the best way of going about this. I‚Äôm hoping taking the Percocet will offset the withdrawals from kratom and will help me stop taking kratom after this. But I need to do anything in my power to not go through any withdrawals. They are so bad for me and I have a full time job that it was affect once I go back to work in a week. Will these Percocets help me quit kratom forever?",3,0
638,2021-02-03 21:47:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/lc5kw2/1_month/,1 month,"I tapered very rapidly over a 6 day period from roughly 50+gpd.  Now, on day 28, I'm really starting to feel much better. The first 2 weeks I had a very typical pink cloud. I started some very good and healthy habits around eating well and exercise. As well as just generally getting my things in order.

I'm also going through a divorce, after 12 years together. It's been pretty stressful, and the past 2 weeks have been mentally tough. I've gone through terrible bouts of occasional depression. Days when I could do little more than wallow in my own mental sorrow. I honestly didn't think I'd get any PAWS. But I probably did. It's hard to distinguish whether this instability was due to quitting kratom or was due to the natural course of dealing with anxiety and grief. You're probably not supposed to feel great when stuff like this happens.

In the past, I'd drown myself in kratom and numb my feelings out of existence. Even though it's been tough, it's been mentally rewarding to deal with grief in a constructive manner. I feel much more at peace with myself and my situation, and I probably would be much worse off if I were still slamming kratom from waking until sleeping.

My use really got to be a problem, and if I'm being totally honest, absolutely contributed to the downfall of my marriage. Though, again, being honest, it's been VERY easy to be completely free from ALL substances over the last month and that's also largely due to trying to maintain a toxic relationship. I had problems way before using kratom. Had I have been sober, I probably would've divorced years ago.

For the past couple week, when I've felt terrible, I try to remind myself that these feelings are normal, and also remember all the things I have to be grateful for. I've been through some very rough and difficult times in my recent past in the military, so it's always good to keep a frame of reference.

The things that have helped me the most are exercise, exercise, socializing, and exercise. I cannot say how much physical exertion has helped. The best side effect from wearing yourself out is restful sleep, which outdoes only the sense of well being one gets subconsciously from self-improvement.

Socializing again has been wonderful. Relearning how to chit chat with people while clear headed is refreshing. I visit the kava bar - where I used to drink a LOT of kratom - on a regular basis. There's little draw to using kratom, and kava I'll have occasionally but I could take it or leave it. It's just such a weird buzz and it isn't something I could ever do regularly. But I'll drink some regular herbal tea, have a kombucha, and bullshit with people. It's something to do when you feel down.

For supplements and helpers, initially the first two weeks I was taking 7-15mg of matrazapine about 2hrs before bedtime and it REALLY helped me get regular, decent sleep.  The first week I had lots of magnesium powder tea and it kept all of the restlessness at bay. I tried dhea and had mixed results. I put on 15lbs of muscle in 45 days, which is crazy, and might be due to the dhea but also due to a nearly perfectly clean diet and plenty of protein and creatine.  But I was also crackhead skinny from kratom.

My stomach has been weird, but not terrible. I've always been slightly lactose intolerant, but when using kratom I could drink as much whey protein shakes as I wanted without issue. Not anymore. Instant diarrhea, which is annoying. Using hydrolyzed whey seems to help a little.  I've had loose stool for the past 30 days, but nothing unmanageable at all. I'm sure it'll improve over time.

Anyways, overall 10/10 would quit kratom again. It wasn't nearly as bad, and my rapid taper probably really helped that. I'd wait until almost 5pm and have a small amount, then have the rest before bed so I could sleep. It worked great. I did suffer during the day, but that was my plan. I strongly recommend this method. I exercised my ass off during the day, took cold showers, and stayed extremely busy so at night, at 9pm, I'd have my second and last tea of the day and pass out shortly after. I think this method works so well because your body goes through mini withdrawals every day, and you get relief at night when you need it to sleep, and sleep repairs.

Anyways, if you're thinking about quitting, don't be scared by the horror stories here. Everyone is different and there are ways to make the quit less painful. It's going to be uncomfortable no matter what, but that isn't comparable to finally being free of the fucking green sludge bullshit.",7,0

I actually had a pretty decent day, after yesterday being one of the worst. We are going super slow with this taper, but tomorrow is the next drop, another check mark on 1.2 grams less per day! I want to point out if this helps at all, during my taper (started at 70 grams per day for 5 or 6 years for reference), I took my normal amount and it started to make me feel weird, so I cut back, WAY back. Too much I think, and I go back and forth thinking I should build back up a little to not withdrawal so hard right off the bat. But I have NOT gone back up, I promise it's not the addict in me that's saying I should build back up, I really and truly am committed to getting off of this stuff, and definitely feel even if I did build back up, I would stay committed to tapering down. But for me, the withdrawals I'm experiencing are incredibly mild physically (minus the skin on my face feeling like it's on fire when I'm in a panic attack), but STRONG mentally. I think I skipped over the physical and went straight to PAWS lol. Oops I'm rambling, what I wanted to point out is just my experience. I see a lot of guides for tapering on here, but I wanted to share my experience so far. I take (7) 3.2 gram doses a day, one every 2 hours and 20 minutes, tapering every 5 days by dropping .2 grams per dose (except the last one of the night, hell maybe I'll drop that too). I take 400mg magnesium at night to help with sleep (which is broken up too frequently for my tastes, but hey at least I am sleeping...) I have gotten myself down to 22.2gpd (the last dose is always a 3.0 indo), and I felt shitty shitty shitty, and absolute the worst on day 4 (yesterday), but today has been way better than day 4. Just wanted to put that out there for people who are really struggling while tapering, for me I'd say I've evened out past day 4 (whatever evened out means for us in this state). So don't get discouraged if you're tapering and day 4 is absolute shit, day 5 is right around the corner!

Another thing... I see a lot of people saying that they hate Kratom because it makes them unmotivated. For me it was the opposite. I started taking Kratom to BECOME motivated to do anything, even go to the store. If you ask me, this is going to be way harder to fix mentally when I am finally off the stuff, but I am determined to do so, so I will find a way!

One last thing.. I see a lot of people posting that they are withdrawing right when they wake up and have to dose right away to do anything. Once again, for me it's the opposite. I feel my best when I wake up and get like 20 minutes into my shift at work, I feel so often ""hey I don't feel like shit, maybe I can skip my first dose"" but my wife is strict (for good reason) about my taper schedule, so I take it. 40-60 minutes later I feel like SHIT. And then on an on the cycle goes for the rest of the day, taking more and feeling more and more terrible as the day goes on. Part of me thinks that this is my body saying it doesn't want the stuff in it anymore, and I should stop taking it. But if I am wrong and CT it, my ass would not be in a good place. What do you guys think? Should I try skipping a first of the morning dose and see how it goes from there? I just don't want to be wrong about how bad the wihdrawals are going to be, not the least of which I will be at work during it. I am taking less than I ever used to and am feeling worse than I ever used to, but I also feel my absolute worst at night, when I've been taking the stuff all day, so I don't know which way to feel about it...",3,0

I want to be as transparent as I can with the reality of what it's been like off of kratom.

I'll start with a more important part of this journey in case you don't read all of this.

You should be asking yourself, why do I want to quit kratom? Why does part of me want to continue taking kratom? The surface reasons are rarely what motivate us to make these choices.

Yes, withdrawals are awful. Cravings are hard. Boredom, irritability, it sucks. I find however that for me it wasn't actually the desires to cease these negative effects and to feel stimulated that were the deeper reason I chose to use it.

I loved Kratom. I loved feeling stimulated and high every minute of every waking hour of my life. I loved being free of the nightmare that was alcohol and medications and other drugs. It helped me with physical pain and to get through life too. Even though I had my own rationalizations about 'microdosing'(which was a lie) there was no other reason for me controlling my dosage or cutting back on it at all other than to get a better high on my next dose.

But deeper down, Kratom functioned as more than a high. It helped keep anxieties at bay. It helped mitigate some feelings of insecurity. Even deeper down at the core, I found there were two real reasons for my choice to continue to use it. The first was that I was afraid to stop taking it, because I couldn't picture what life would look like without it. The second, the real reason, is that Kratom numbed my emotional pain. And in a way, the numbing from Kratom itself, it hurt. All the time it hurt. But I liked it. I liked the way it hurt because it felt like something.

I don't know you or if you have a problem with drugs/kratom. But if you do have an ongoing battle with it, I would look at what your deeper reason is at the heart of that choice, what it is you're fighting against. The second part, and the important part that I've learned about anything, is that people just choose the best option.

When I finally stopped drinking alcohol, it wasn't because it had destroyed my life, relationships, sanity, self. The real reason was far simpler. It did do all those things I mentioned, but the real truth is I stopped drinking because alcohol stopped working. I couldn't get a buzz anymore. So I look at myself and I can see, there's no fairy tale in which I rose up strong and overcame alcohol, that might be the story I tell myself, but in reality it just stopped working so I had to find a better option.

For me personally with quitting kratom, it was that I realized I wanted to heal. I wanted to feel. And I wanted to feel my own pain. I was tired of feeling it hurting me and not being able to access it. I used kratom in order to feel, and eventually the idea of quitting (which now meant for the first time being entirely off drugs) was the option that in my head was, ""maybe I can feel even more if I stop taking it. Even better.

With my other reason, being afraid of what life would look like without it, I became curious and interested in wanting to know what it would be like, and a bit excited, and that desire to know overcame that fear.

So in a way I didn't really quit kratom, I just pursued something I thought was better and more worth it to me. My advice for getting off something, is pursuing something you want even more in your life. Maybe that's a practical reason like saving money, or something deeper like searching for happiness, love, god, facing your insecurities..or even pursuing the question of what you should pursue..",83,0

You might be in the middle of one of the worst moments of your life, but it it will pass, and you will get through this.  

If you have already made the choice to quit, to improve your life, improve yourself, improve your relationships.   

You just need to stay on the path.  

A little over a month ago, I was overweight and sick with what was probably the beginning of serious kidney issues.

I was working for 14 - 18 hours a day, sometimes without much of a break, and treating myself like garbage.  

I was tired all of the time and didn't see any future ahead of me.  

One morning I looked at myself in the mirror and decided that I didn't want to be this sick person who was weak and addicted to opioids.  

I created boundaries, made time for self-improvement, and told myself that I deserve to be happy and healthy. 

The first week was the worst for the WDs, but the tips on this subreddit helped me deal with the worst of them.  

Walking has been very important.  

Every evening I walk for at least 1 hour and go for longer walks on the weekend.  

Regular activity has kept my anxiety in check and helped me sleep at night.  

35 days later, I'm healthy again.  I have no cravings or WD symptoms.  

I've lost over 13 lbs and am stronger and healthier than I've been for years.  

I'm still working toward a lot of different personal goals and have a long way to go, but having my health and my sanity is making it possible for me to have those goals and keep them.

You can live without Kratom.  And you'll live better.  

There is no magic substance that can fix all of your problems effortlessly.  

You'll need to put in the work to address the issues you were having before you started.  But you can do it, and there are thousands of people here in this community that want you to succeed and are here to support you.  

Right now things might be darker than they've ever been, but there is light at the end of that tunnel.

I mostly want to just sit and do nothing but that just makes me feel like I need to be doing something. I feel exhausted, yet refuse to relax. My body and mind are at war at the moment. As I lay here I am thinking of about 10 different things I can go do. 

I feel like I need to start making up for lost time. I know I‚Äôm very lucky. Extremely lucky. I can‚Äôt believe my partner had stuck through this with me yet again. I understand this is probably the last time. Both of us have had addiction problems. For a while it became this back and forth relapse cycle until it had to stop. And it did mostly. Right before we bought our house was when I found Kratom. We have been in this house 4 years and I have had 9 months of that Kratom free. So frustrating, confusing, infuriating, expensive. 

Why does it not occur to me all the time I have wasted? I feel like I just want to jump onto some other substance to make this all go away. 

I am honestly doing pretty well from what I remember the last time. I should go back and read what was going then. Might help me remember how good I‚Äôm going to feel a little ways from now. My heart just sank think of our first vacation after I quit. We did the high point of Georgia. The day we did it was a day they did this fun run up this giant hill that is the high point. Called the ‚ÄúBrass Town Bald Buster‚Äù. It was damn hard mentally and physically. But it was fun. 

Knowing we had that trip was one of the things that kept me going on days that I just felt exhausted. I wish I had never thought I could touch the stuff again.

I have BPD and don't have any therapy atm so I was mainly using it to self-medicate. It led to me having issues with my throat (always feels swollen now) so I've had to stop and began using kratom to deal with coming off of it. At first it was going well, but eventually it became a crutch like every other drug I've done. I used to do ""real"" opiates (heroin, pills) and actually used to do kratom before starting heroin back in high school because I was addicted to pills and wanted to do something that was cheaper/easier to get.

Long story short, the last two-ish weeks I was wash and go-ing kratom every day. On Sunday I didn't like being high anymore and decided to stop. Monday I noticed my stool looked...different. I was clearly constipated. I will spare you the details, but as a former heroin addict I knew the sign of opiod poop. I had a horrible time with that on H and I knew where I'd be headed if I kept doing kratom daily. 

Next, I noticed a drippy nose. Again, as a former H addict this is another a red flag. I thought I might have caught a cold but I don't have any other synptoms, it's like an allergy drip where just my nose is irritated. 

I still have tons of kratom, and I'm skeptical on doing it again. Part of me wants to save it for emergencies (my period, depressed states, etc). The first time around as a teenager I never experienced the withdrawal because I switched to H without stopping getting high. I really didn't know there was a withdrawal from this stuff until I started reading this subreddit. 

Any advice? It's been hard to get therapy that accepts my insurance which is why I've been leaning on these legal drugs (weed is legal in my state) but I don't want to be attached to another high. But I'm also worried I'll return to smoking when my emotions feel out of control/I'm in a lot of physical pain. Part of me wants to say fuck the withdrawal symptoms and just do whatever, but I reaaallly do not look forward to spending hours on the toilet pushing nothing out. I'm also curious if anyone else who has done kratom for shorter periods of time/lower doses has experienced withdrawals when they quit. 

Obviously it's up to me to make the right decision, but any advice or stories of similar experiences on how to deal with being sober would be appreciated.",2,0

It is in my vagina my bladder, I suspect my bowels, my sinuses, my head.  It is killing me.  I still have terrible legs at night.

It's awful and anxiety and headaches are unbelievable and I am so mad at myself.

Mad at myself for getting like this again.  Mad at myself for acting the way I did on Kratom in two days my mind is clear enough to look back and feel ashamed.  I know shame is so hard to overcome and not helpful but my God I am ashamed.

But I have a little fire in my belly and I am mad at the substance itself too.  So hopefully this will keep me moving through this physical pain so I can start working on the mental.

I finally had enough after a massive, 5 year habit of 30-40gpd plain leaf Kratom. I can no longer deny that Kratom has changed me for the worse. I got disinterested, emotionally blunted and terribly lazy. I was increasingly happy to not do anything but take Kratom(along with beer or wine) and read pointless stuff on various discussion boards. I neglected my job, my relationship, and even my two small kids. First two or three years were actually fine, I was more patient, had more energy, the Kratom was working its magic. But that somehow reversed, I guess you all know that phenomenon. 

Anyways, I have withdrawn 5 times in my Kratom career (and relapsed after a few months, obviously) and I wanted to share some observations that may help others here:

&#x200B;

1. Kratom withdrawal is not that bad, really. I have withdrawn from Benzos and from Poppy Pods and both were much much worse than Kratom withdrawals. Don't be afraid, you can do it. It sucks for a week, followed by another week or so of feeling tired. The cravings and relapses are a different beast, though. 

2. Do not use Benzos for WDs, please! For my second withdrawal I used heavy duty RC Benzos to sleep, which backfired in a spectacular way. I could sleep, yes, but I immediately got terribly depressed and got stuck on the benzos. Benzos are far far worse than Kratom can ever be, so better stay away from that poison. I  dumped the Benzos (bad mistake), got a seizure and ended up in hospital. The insomnia is part of the withdrawal process, just accept it. 

3. Get yourself some Loperamide (Immodium) and just quit the Kratom Cold Turkey. No tapering needed, sensible doses of Loperamide will make your WDs MUCH better. Taking 8-10 mg of Loperamide (4-5 capsules) when WDs kick in takes away the really nasty physical symptoms. No more shivering, sneezing, yawning, no runny nose, no hot flashes and no crazy intestinal symptoms. Your body is fully immersed in a really strong opioid but your mind can heal as the Loperamide does not reach your brain. Do not take loads of Loperamide, it can have central (brain) action if taken in large doses and you can get hooked on it. I never take more than 16mg a day. A week or ten days of Loperamide is enough to be done with the Kratom withdrawal. Taper it down after that to avoid really bad diarrhea. For me, this stuff is a game changer. First three WDs were moderately miserable, but with Loperamide I function pretty normally, just very tired and sluggish, mainly due to the insomnia. 

&#x200B;

Good luck quitting. I think I will be able to avoid relapse this time as Kratom has really lost its shine for me. Before that, I was still in love with Kratom and not ready to quit. It was mainly my wife nagging me to stop but that was not enough motivation to stay away from Kratom. It is really odd that Kratom is still fully legal here in Germany. A powerful opioid substance, dirt cheap and freely available. It is banned in almost every country around here but the German regulators keep ignoring it. Bad for me as I obviously had to try the stuff.",11,0

I felt each capsule came together quicker, and ultimately taking it took me a fraction of the time. The way things are, I can't see any way around putting together my own capsules and removing one every few days. I've puked a few times trying to drink powder. It's hit or miss. I use to easily drink it in an extra sweet pure leaf tea. The amount of calories I spent on just taking kratom. I can no longer drink all that sugar and drinks now take over an hour. You guys warned me that doing your own caps would be time consuming. I thought I was prepared, but it somehow was more of a pain in the ass than I could ever imagine. I've never wanted to be done more than I do now. Hopefully I will find easier and easier ways to do this, and by take less and less, it'll be less time wasted on this.",2,0

Aside the toll it has taken on my body it become a huge wedge in my marriage. Like most people on here I‚Äôve overcome heavier drugs and was clean for sometime. I even tried Kratom when I was trying to get off pills and heroin only to find out later that I just wasn‚Äôt taking enough at once. After I figured that out I was off to the races. For me it was the added motivation and energy I get from using it. The drive to just go and get shit done was a excuse I tell myself in order to get another. I have a hectic work schedule where being awake and alert is key, 12hr days/nights in excess of 7-14 days at a time sometimes. Today would‚Äôve been my first 24hrs without using up until about an hour ago. My wife and I got into an argument which resulted in me getting into the car and as soon I pull off she calls and hits me with the ‚Äú oh you‚Äôre gonna use this as an excuse to use‚Äù.... and during that moment I made the right choice and just drove around the block because I didn‚Äôt want to make that my excuse like I have in the past. I come back home, we argue more and this time I leave and in my own pettiness I said fuck it that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm doing. There‚Äôs a lot wrong with my behavior and I‚Äôm too old be acting like that period. I‚Äôm ashamed I allowed this situation to toss what little progress I made today down the drain. So here I am after sowing 20g writing on this sub. I know the toll my drug use as a whole has taken on my wife and when I came back from the store she was packing suitcases with clothes and thought wow you‚Äôve reall done it this time man. I just just hate how I cannot regulate my emotions and impulsive actions most the time with this type of stuff.

I was using about 50-60 GPD for about 2 years. Much like a lot of stories here, I enjoyed the positive effects from kratom for about the first year. I believed the hype and got sucked in, thinking it was a harmless plant. My girlfriend was ok with me using it even though she didn‚Äôt care for it. I bought bulk supply online and make really good money as Estimator for several large construction companies, so cost never really was an issue. Around the one year mark I started to plateau and it became more of a maintenance type routine. One night around the beginning of December 2020 I took my last dose before bed and laid down. My girlfriend and I were watching tv and my heart started pounding out of my chest. My ears started to ring very loudly and I felt like I was dying. We drove to the ER and they ran some test and declared it a panic attack. I hadn‚Äôt made the connection with kratom as to the cause until days later. I switched strains and vendors to rule out a bad batch, but over the next several days I would have a panic attack after every dose. I thought I was going to have a mental breakdown. I have never had to deal with any mental issues before kratom so I was extremely scared. I decided to quit ct only to discover after about 24 hours I would have these same panic attacks provoked by the wd. I felt trapped. I cannot put into words how terrible these panic attacks were. I decided the only option was to taper. I cut my daily consumption in half at first and took smaller doses more frequently seem to help me avoid these panic attacks for the most part. I wanted off this stuff so much. I rapidly tapered over the next month down to 2 GPD, it was hell. I called work and told them I may have been exposed to COVID and needed to work from home for the upcoming week, then I jumped. 

Days 1-3 physically sucked. Mental not great either but overall not as bad as I anticipated. 

Days 4-7 very up and down physically. I would have short moments where I felt fine but soon reminded of the physical symptoms I was dealing with. Mentally I was very anxious all the time. I had a really bad panic attack the night of day 7 that lasted all night. My girlfriend literally had to talk me out of going to the hospital several times, knowing they wouldn‚Äôt do anything. 

Days 8-11
Physical and mental symptoms started fading away. Big improvements in sleep and appetite. 

Days 12-15
I feel about 90% back to normal. Still wake up kinda groggy from patchy sleep and deal with low energy at certain times of the day. I‚Äôm eating like a damn teenager again and have put on about 7 pounds which is great. I lost a lot of weight over the 2 years I used kratom. 

I detoxed off heroin ct in October 2016 and it was hell and kratom is the only other substance I‚Äôve used since. Comparing the 2 withdrawals I think other opiate like drugs have a more severe, shorter withdrawal period. I remember my 4th day off heroin like being reborn again. I woke up felt 100% normal again. Kratom seems less severe physically but definitely longer. Kratom seems to also have a huge effect mentally as well. I still don‚Äôt feel 100% mentally, but it‚Äôs very tolerable at this point. Kratom wd is running like a marathon compared to other opiates. 


What helped me most:
1. Motive: the panic attacks were kind of a blessing in a way. Once I made the connection that kratom was directly causing them, it scared me so bad my only option was to quit. Don‚Äôt give yourself a plan b. When things get bad or dark, just walk through it and remember it‚Äôs just a feeling. Whether it be mental or physical, it‚Äôs just a temporary feeling.
2. Make yourself get up. Even if it‚Äôs just to take a shower. I felt the worst sitting still for long periods of time. Yes rest and relax when you can but break it with sort of activity

It‚Äôs not easy buts it‚Äôs definitely worth it!",22,1

There‚Äôs even like a high that comes with the initial quit, but then there‚Äôs stage 2, which I believe is the phase I‚Äôm in, like ok, no more Kratom and life is dull, not sure what my life is not enhanced by something like Kratom. This part is hard cause I‚Äôm no longer amazed by the fact that I‚Äôm functioning without Kratom and now I‚Äôm just wondering how I‚Äôm suppose to function and get through each day.

I also began using powder leaf.

I usually only took kratom on days I went to the gym and only right before as part of a pre-work out.

So I have quit before by simply stopping.

Somehow along the line I began using powder leaf on my off days and then every day. I figured I would just use up my stockpile.

I stuck to a local vendor mostly due to convenience, but I did buy from an online vendor once. I remember thinking how potent the effects were and how narcotic they felt.

When I quit phenibut after being on it about 22 months daily use by using baclofen, lyrica, NAC, and agmatine, it seemed kratom stopped feeling good or anything. I figured when I ran out I wouldn't buy anymore.

That would be yesterday when I woke up okay and proceeded to acknowledge I had nothing at all.

As the day progressed, I gave myself dozens of diagnoses. I thought I just had a bad head cold. I thought it could be a flu but with anxieties thrown in.

So I did what anyone would do maybe, and I got in my car to drive to the local vendor. I checked my money situation. I parked. I got out, tugged the door. Locked?!? Tugged the door. Checked the sign. Closed Sunday!! 

So I became resigned to rough out day and night #1 and see how bad it gets. I have no choice. I mean, I kicked methadone CT by choice before. I kicked heroin CT before. I just got off phenibut and clonazepam by tapering. I thought surely I had been thru more and was a seasoned vet when it comes to getting off addictive substances.

Luckily I had no restless legs but I did have insomnia. Tossing and turning and sweating. Things seem worse at night. Everything I felt, all the symptoms brought triggered PTSD. I kept trying to encourage myself to stay quit and go by the heroin model, that days 1-3 are the worse and then it gets better. And I got by day #1. 

I began to fret over my two doctor appts on Thursday coming up being in such a state. I figured it would be day #5 by then, and this is the day when people usually report feeling better and on the mend, maybe.

But who was I kidding?

Somehow I snagged a couple hours here and there. Then I had to wrench my drippy self out of bed to get my son to preschool.

See, if I didn't have a family that would drop kick me for getting hooked on kratom, even by accident (like I said, I quit before without problem, but that was before daily use). I still have all these duties with my two young ones. And cooking and cleaning. I kept thinking, if I could stay in bed and have someone do all that for me, or maybe, if I my I were single with no kids (I'm separated)... All these lame excuses.

So who was I kidding?

I read on here last night that quitting CT is mostly a head game. I believe that to be right. I know my symptoms got worse if I decided to buy more kratom bc time seemed so slow and my anxiety worsened and I couldn't lie still. If I could distract myself and think about nothing and meditate, I could relax.

Sad ending. I dropped my son off at preschool at 9am and went by the kratom vendor and got some more. I kept thinking that tapering would be better for my situation. I tapered clonazepam and stopped it and had no symptoms. When I CT that before I had seizures. It's just a big shock to the system.

So I guess I learned kratom is way more addictive than I expected. How is this stuff legal and not controlled? I really had no idea it would be this bad. It wasn't as bad as CT methadone but it wasn't like stopping caffeine either. At least for me.

I think it is the inability to regulate my body temperature, my sweating, my irritability, my anxiety, the waves of cravings and panic... The pain returning... Insomnia, too. Restlessness, being tired. All while having major commitments makes it seem harder than it is.

So while I just popped some extract caps to calm my symptoms and not to feel any benefit, I want to budget my money and stick to tapering.

My usual dose has been 16g 2-3x/day.

Could I get some feedback on how quickly I can get off this stuff? I am on SSDI and am running thru my stimulus checks for this stuff, too. 

I take lyrica, baclofen, and topamax.

I've been taking kratom for about 6 years now. It started off with some capsules i found on amazon(crazy right?). My son was being born in a couple of days and I wanted to make sure I had enough energy and drive to be the best help i could for my wife while she was in labor and the days after that as I'm naturally a pretty damn lazy SOB. I heard about kratom from reddit actually as I was looking for something to replace opiates because my wife threatened to divorce me over them, so kratom it was. 

So i waited for my order to finally arrive, thinking that I possibly just wasted 80 bucks on some peoples opinions and my addictive nature. But fuck it I said and hoped for the best. The capsules arrived the day before my wife was induced and I told her they were supposed to help me with the anxiety of watching a tiny human crawl out of another human. I waited until that night after dinner and took about 5 of them, maybe 3 or 4 grams, waited an hour, and that hour turned into another and another. I didn't feel shit, I was super upset but I chalked it up to lying about it and karma laughing at me. The next morning we went to the hospital, both of our families were there and I was a fucking WRECK. Her family was well to do and judged me like crazy. Luckily I had left my wallet and social security card at home which I needed for signing the birth certificate so I went home to grab it. And there it was, the kratom, staring at me. This time, I opened about 8 capsules and mixed it into some milk(NEVER DO THIS) I must have stirred that shit for 15 minutes. I chugged it, grabbed my wallet and hit the road. It was about a 15 minute drive back to the hospital and I didnt feel anything again. I hit the elevator and made my way up, dreading the eyeballs I knew were about to be on me. But something happened in that elevator, I said to myself ""fuck it, I'm about to be a daddy"" and I smiled and felt my body glow and a wave of euphoria shot over me like a warm blanket. I felt like I had just take two hydro 7.5 and skipped my happy ass into the room like I was god. That's where it gets you, it stuck its claws in me and didnt let go for 6 entire years. It saved my relationship, it opened me up to people I normally shut out. My anxieties and depression basically disappeared and I felt like I could take on the world all under the guise of it being natural, and that i couldn't get addicted to it.

So flash forward 4 years after my sons birth, my companies pay checks were delayed by almost a week and I had no kratom and no extra money to buy anymore and I wasnt gonna ask my wife because she had already started getting on my ass for how much I was spending. I remember eating dinner, showering and laying down, that night I tossed and turned, my arms felt like they wanted to break and I ended up with massive diarrhea and my wife, being the hawkeye she was, pinpointed everything I was going through and accused me of using again. She researched kratom like a scholar and called me out on my years of lying about it. She ended up leaving, she cheated on me, she packed all my shit up in garbage bags and tossed it in the garage. I was broken, and I mean on the verge of driving my car into an 18 wheeler but I didnt. I got my paycheck and went to the head shop and bought as much kratom as I could and left the state to go to my mother's house in Texas. I worked several jobs over the last 2 years, taking upwards of 65gpd and shut myself off from the world, I was done. 

September of 2020 i got diagnosed with Avascular Necrosis of the hip otherwise known as Osteonecrosis. I can barely walk these days, I cant stand up or sit down without a walker and I cant work. The kratom helped so much with my pain but I ran out and I have zero dollars to my name so I said fuck it, I'm done with the shit. I feel like all of this happened for a reason and I deserve every bit of what has happened and what I'm going through as i type this. I'm hoping someone will read my story and think twice before they use kratom. It always starts off amazing, until you become numb to it and depression and anxiety finds it's way through the cracks tenfold. I started this story saying how much it saved me and I'm ending it with how it ruined a part of my life. I'm ready to face reality without a crutch, to rebuild myself from the ground up if I can walk or not. I'm WD'ing like crazy but I felt good enough to type this, plus I've had it bottled up for so long. Sorry if I rambled and went off the deep end but I think it's important to let go, and hopefully help someone along the way.",15,0

Minimal withdrawals. I am fine. But. I have been trying to remember the endocrine system for my physiology class and I can't. I read it, I understand it, and the next day I remember very little of it. Is the subject hard to remember, is my kratom free brain at fault? I don't know. I have an exam next week, if I fail it I am afraid I might relapse. I just don't know what to do at this point.",1,0
